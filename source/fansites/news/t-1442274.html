Armory Stats - Battleground Win Ratios<br />
Today we are taking a look at the win percentage for each faction and battleground that took place in the last month. To find these numbers, we compared the number of battles and victories a character had in a December snapshot of data to a January snapshot of data.<br />
<br />
These numbers come from a character's statistics pane, so any bugs with character statistics will have skewed the results. This means that there isn't any way for us to verify how accurate these numbers are, so do not take them as fact.<br />
<br />
Percentages came fairly close to 100% in most cases, so we normalized the data to 100%. Unfortunately it seems that most Eye of the Storm wins are still not recorded in your statistics most of the time. This bug has been around for five or more years now, but we normalized the data we had (~7.9% and ~9.8% win ratios for each faction) for the chart. <br />
<br />
The data used today is a sample made up of ~7 million level 90 characters and ~16 million battles. The sample is slightly biased, as players who are not in a guild are less likely to appear in our sample. <br />
<br />
You can see the data from the last time we did this back in 2011 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2187-Battleground-Horde-Alliance-Win-Ratio-Setup-of-the-Month), which shows a slightly different picture.<br />

Upcoming Siege of Orgrimmar Changes<br />
I agree. I also am not sure why removing the trivial healing mechanic from Sigecrafter is even...worth it. Most guilds are 4 healing this encounter to kill it, now it's definitely going to be a 4 heal fight. Directly after your tuned for 6-8 fight, Thok. ???<br />
Raid groups are largely making steady progress, but as I said, there are exceptions. Regarding Heroic difficulty in particular, it's pretty obvious that there is a very large jump in difficulty from Thok to Siegecrafter. Siegecrafter/Paragons/Garrosh are currently very close to equal in difficulty, with each presenting different challenges and guilds taking roughly the same number of attempts to defeat each. We'd rather see an upward slope in difficulty, which leaves guilds feeling like the next step is within reach given enough time and dedication, rather than a sudden jump up to a much higher difficulty plateau. That's why we're nerfing Heroic Blackfuse moderately, Paragons just a little bit, and Garrosh not at all.<br />
<br />
The changes shouldn't be enough to meaningfully alter healer composition, but they will make some of those &quot;combo&quot; deaths to two damage sources overlapping a bit less likely. <br />
<br />
I'm certain that guilds who have already defeated these encounters or who are on the verge of doing so will find that the adjustments make a big difference, but remember, that's because you've already refined a working strategy and have practiced the execution. Guilds coming into the fights for the first time will still need to handle the precise movement associated with the different Blackfuse phases, belt teams will have to learn to navigate the belt lasers consistently, and so forth. Both Blackfuse and Paragons will remain quite challenging. And then there's always Garrosh....<br />

Art<br />
I've been asking to allow us to make uncorrupted orcs for a while. Any chance of that happening???<br />
can't definitively say yes, but it's likely that will be an option in some way. It would be cool to see UO PC in Azeroth (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/420240346287579136))<br />
<br />
Would it really be that difficult to update the goblin/worgen models? You guys surely still have the original LoDs, right?<br />
I'd like to at some point, they still use our original rigging/animation system. Pandaren introduced new system. (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/420010766842871808))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Will [Ai-Li's Skymirror] ever be allowed to copy one's character illusion again? Ex: Grasp from Pre-ZF? An updated WoD version?<br />
Those are fun, but we don't want it to become annoying, and that opens up too many possibilities. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420066414142054400))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Will Disc at least be fixed to do double healing from a multistrike crit. Else it is 100% useless stat for Disc.<br />
I think you may misunderstand something. Crits don't do doublehealing for Disc, as a rule. But how does that make MS useless? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420311774638772224))<br />
Sorry, said that backwards, when a spell crit as Disc procs MS, the MS is just as powerful as non-crit, makes it feel weak<br />
You're misunderstanding Multistrike. The healing of the hit that triggered multistrike doesn't matter. Separate healing roll. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420428623003144192))<br />
And an MS that crits would trigger Divine Aegis. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420428755710914560))<br />
<br />
I keep seeing promises that the item squish won't affect soloing capabilities, but is this for all characters or only level 90s?<br />
All. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420365820015804416))<br />
That is to say; the squish won't affect soloing capabilities, but other changes may. Soloing at low levels isn't a balance focus. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420366130876674048))<br />
<br />
Does this mean that we'll start seeing the new stats (possibly mastery even) on gear at very low levels?<br />
Mastery is staying lvl80+. New stats are still being determined, but most likely not available from level 1. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420066849296891905))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
I hope this wouldn't replace Warstomp. I know it's not the best for PvE DPS but great for questing/soloing as a caster druid.<br />
No, we wouldn't replace Warstomp. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420066065830256640))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
That is good news! Are you planning to increase base resilience with the new season?<br />
Yes (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420653520820256768))<br />
<br />
How big in game scale wise is Ashran? Like are we talking AV big or Wintergrasp big<br />
From base to base is similar to AV but it's wider. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420348121730654208))<br />
Would you say Ashran is a spiritual successor to AV? Or more like Timeless Isle?<br />
More like AV (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420373947289309184))<br />
<br />
back to gear being the major determining factor in PvP success. Guess the accessibility experiment didn't work out?<br />
I don't really see how you came to that conclusion. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420059429690552320))<br />
dialing back resilience &quot;as much as possible&quot; says bursty PvP and emphasizes PvP power. Sounds like old times 2 me.<br />
In WoD, health pools will be relatively larger and PvP Power is being redefined. It will end up less bursty. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420071620997156865))<br />
Is this true for low lvl PvP too? Some spells are too potent in heirloom gear. Aimed Shot and Shield Slam can *literally* one-shot.<br />
A lot of spells have base damage which leads to this issue. We're going through these spells to reduce the base damage. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420300460524720129))<br />
<br />
so I was wondering if you guys could start doing realm rankings/leaders instead of region? A lot of friends and I are curious.<br />
We've gotten the request a lot so we'll have to look into it. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420072710232735749))<br />
&quot;Instead&quot;? Why not &quot;in addition to&quot;?<br />
Certainly what I meant (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420179154944794624))<br />
<br />
It also feels lousy to work hard to acquire full grievous gear only to be killed by a dragon slayer in heroic pve gear<br />
Yup, we've mentioned we don't want to end up in this situation again. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420060806152085504))<br />
but I give you credit in admiting that what occurred was not what you intended.<br />
Certain systems (like warforged and upgrades) that inflate ilevels didn't make much sense for PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420070028499619840))<br />
PvP not having them meant gear falling further behind. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420070055280250881))<br />
<br />
I've already given you a good solution. Nerf dmg/healing by 65/55% and roll those numbers into a raid wide buff for players who pve<br />
It isn't a good solution for the same reasons base resilience and battle fatigue aren't good solutions. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420054481389121536))<br />
The entire reason why you needed BF/Resil is because abilities do too much damage/healing.<br />
It's lousy to have a spell hit for 100k against a creature and 20k against a player no matter where you increase/decrease it. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420058924553732096))<br />
<br />
as horde I frequently spend more time in random BG queue then in the actual games. Fix it please. Faction conflict !&gt; fast queues<br />
I wish it could be fixed quickly. I really do. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/420059546095071232))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor<br />
Didnt know where to ask. Blizzcon mention quest items gone from bank in WoD. Will my [Amulet of Draconic Subversion] disappear?<br />
Don't know yet. Could be considered a Toy, perhaps. If you still have the quest, may be kept. Very up in the air, know important (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420065883440939008))<br />

Forgive me for not understanding, but how is that necessarily a &quot;bad&quot; thing? That player worked hard to get their heroic PVE gear too. Why can't they get some kills? For arena, sure, I can see that being a problem, but BGs should be accessible to PVE'ers.</div></div><hr />

They shouldn't happen outside the super mainstream content unless it's a fix or balancing because of class stacking. <br />
<br />
It makes comparisons to guilds that have previously cleared the content impossible and thus completely invalidate any real progression.<br />

Interesting to note that the old stats show horde having a huge win ratio over alliance in IoC though if recent memory serves me no changes to that BG have been made.<br />

lol, giving reason why IoC/AV should change/remove with your left hand while trying to deny the underlying reason is you want the advantage in ALL bgs with your right hand<br />

What an absolutely horrible idea. It's interesting to note how many horde players will complain about the 40 mans but don't seem to have a problem with winning the majority of everything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I say gear should cross over more. Let PVP gear be slightly worse but still viable in raids, and PVE gear about the same in BGs. I'd rather players be able to enjoy both without having to spend double the time to get the respective gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Railander</div><div class="date">2014-01-20, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i assume the people being perplexed by the statistics havent done bgs in a while.<br />
the main reason the disparity between alliance/horde w/l rations skyrocketed in favor of alliance in AV and IoC was because of the option to blacklist bgs.<br />
compare january's graphic with the one from 2011. the trends were the same, but deffinitely not as impacted.<br />
back when the 2011 statistic was snapshotted (WotLK i believe), horde still used to win IoC, but if you remember cataclysm, alliance almost always won it. when MoP came out and the option to blacklist bgs was implemented, horde players simply blacklisted the bgs they used to lose most of the time (those 2), which resulted in only inexperienced horde players still playing them (because they dont even know there is an option to blacklist them) or bots.<br />
alliance, on the other hand, picked some other 2 bgs that they thought they lost the most to blacklist. again, inexperienced players and bots still played said bgs.<br />
<br />
bg blacklisting was a great idea in principle, but turned out disastrous. it is also the main reason queue times are horrible.<br />
<br />
as for why there were trends in bgs to begin with, the only explanation i can think of is mentality formed among the years in both factions. all bgs are symmetrical enough that a 1% delta in w/l ratios would still be a bit much solely because of it.</div></div><hr />

Honestly though, ioC would probably be a lot of fun as a 10-15 player Bg. It's just a complete fail with 40 people tho. Actually, i don't think the map is that far off being a nice world zone, but it's totally not suited for complete pugs, you don't even have the same realm recognition fallback of TB-esque battlefields to fall back on most of the time :P</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't call winrates up to 68.3% slightly dominated, Horde flat out smash Alliance in every battleground except Warsong Gulch which I would call slightly dominated. But no, lets complain about the two battlegrounds Alliance win and how they need to be rebalanced. Horde can just blacklist those two and go win like 60%+ of their battlegrounds, Alliance can only blacklist 2/9.</div></div><hr />

horde have it ez to bl the 2 ones they lose more often in hence the disparity<br />
allies have to choose 2 from a group of 9 and they are not going to choose the same<br />
overall the stats will be a bit more even cos of that factor<br />

The 3 BGs that need to be looked at/rebalanced are obviously Alterac Valley, Isle of Conquest, and Strands of the Ancient. That large of a disparity shouldn't be acceptable.</div></div><hr />

You are missing the point, a LOT of Alliance only queue for IOC and AV because its a steamroll when half of the opposing team are bots, I dare you to roll a 90 on horde and queue IOC so you can watch 10-20 people every game mount up at the beginning, pile up into a ball and run continuously to mid then graveyard run the rest of the game because they are all using the same program. Never again will I ever join that madness, if you dont blacklist then all you get is IOC and AV, I shit you not... every game...

Ok, so Arathi Basin= Horde 60% to Alli 40%(20% losing ratio not good or even close to your 50%) Warsong Gulch=47.4% Alli to 52.6 Horde ( The only one close to your so call dream ratio. still almost a 6% discrepancy) EOS= Alli 44% to horde 55%( 10% no even close). SOTA= 34%Alli to Horde 68%(That's 30% not even close) TP= 42% Alliance 57% to horde (12% not close.) BFG= 42% to Alli 57% horde ( 12% diff) ToK= 41% Alli to 58% Horde(17% diff) SM= 35% Alli to 64% horde( 30% diff again) DG= 42% Alli to 57% horde ( 15% diff.) <br />
<br />

Alliance doesn't have an advantage in AV or IoC. I have never once seen a horde team backcap towers in AV, and I have never seen horde make a concerted attempt to kill the first round of glaives in IoC. Horde lose those two because all the good players blacklist them and the Horde players that do play them don't know a winning strategy.

That's most likely because Alterac Valley has shorter distances for Alliance, easier bosses and multiple choke points that cannot be circumvented in any way, not to mention the tower design is less convoluted and makes it easier for ranged to move and kite. <br />
<br />
It's been on the table since 2005 when AV came out and nothing was ever done about it. One spawn change was made and that's about it.<br />

We won with 3 bases, having 4 most of the game. I have to assume bots are involved. My heals were equal to 3 of their healers combined. I think if you are Alliance play AV/IoC.

There is no cp in specific q'ing outside of cta<br />
also im trying to work my way slowly towards bloodthirsty and i also like cp along the way as a bonus<br />
so outside of cta, i always use q rbg<br />
on avg its takes me about 4-6 random bgs to get the daily 150cp done, on a bad streak it takes about 6-8 randoms <br />
outside of lucky landing in av/ioc first go, i rarely get them (im lucky i get one of them in 20-30 games)<br />
so your point has absolutely no meaning to me<br />
<br />
at the end of the day THIS is what happens<br />
horde bl av/ioc, allies bl 2 of the other 9<br />
<br />
both sides q random bgs, but since there is a lot of horde players that blacklist the ONLY 2 that they lose more in, the randomd bg q will be like 80-90% of the 9 remaining bgs and that horde has the advantage in<br />
so horde wins those bgs more often<br />
<br />
small disadvantage is the longer q times which i think it a price well worth paying<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
also i dont understand why horde think there is alliance map advantage in ioc/av<br />
90% of the time horde dont backcap while alliance do, when horde do, alliance generally lose<br />
also i dont see why they say docks are closer to alliance = instant loss, all it takes is 2 ppl to kill those glaives, they onyl have 1.2mill hp, sometimes only 1 person is required. ive killed both glaives on my hunter b4 when horde actually steamrolled to docks instead of mass hanger and partial ws</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dristereau</div><div class="date">2014-01-20, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might as well add this here. I play both Factions in PVP. I always Blacklist AV and IoC as Horde, and IoC/SotA as Alliance. I blacklist these Battlegrounds because fairly often little to no PVP Happens. Alliance tactics are always the same, the outcome is based on how the Horde react. In IoC, Alliance will go Docks. If Horde kill Glaives, they can win, because Glaives are what the Alliance rely on. In AV, if the Horde defends at Galv, they usually win. Otherwise the Alliance wins usually due to Zerg.<br />
<br />
Regarding AV, I do consider it biased. If players listen and DKs/Paladins rush FW Towers, Alliance can be still killing Galv whilst FW are being capped. On the other hand, I consider SSM to be Horde biased due to ease of access to both Lava and Mid Carts.<br />
<br />
Why do the Horde win more? Teamwork, Gear and Playing the Objective. Horde players from my experience often have Gear that currently is mostly Grievous, yet Alliance often have Timeless Gear or Ungemmed/Unenchanted Tyrannical. Alliance Players are more interested in fighting than trying to win the BG, and willing to ignore Objectives if they can kill that bad guy. Horde seem to have more focus on killing Healers, and Alliance sometimes ignores them.<br />
<br />
If Horde were to defend AV, you would see a different result in that BG. Gear and Healers in smaller BGs are much more important than in the 40 Man PVE Raids (AV/IoC). Looking at BGTargets, you can often tell which team will win based on HP and Healers.<br />
<br />
These are my Personal opinions. I've recorded the last 100 BGs I played (4th Jan - 18th Jan) and will hopefully post the results of my experiences soon, when I organize them.</div></div><hr />

Why because an unfair game is funny? Just the opening of AV is unfair while Ally can easy kill galv with a grp of 20 the simple fact Bal freezes herself for a few seconds setting the Horde assault back is imbalanced.</div></div><hr />

This is true. The change came from the change in Alliance strategy. Instead of all the alliance going for docks and horde capping workshop. Alliance now grabs both which leave the horde with purely running 4 bombs at a time inside the alliance keep.</div></div><hr />

So your argument is that Horde don't lose AV and IoC because they completely fail to backcap AV towers, and completely fail to zerg the first set of glaives (and therefore guarantee a win), but rather that Horde start farther back in AV and Alliance can reach the docks flag faster?<br />

Galv has ALWAYS been considered the harder boss, and the same goes for Drek. Your other two points I have seen differing opinions though.<br />
<br />
Back in the days, we (Horde) had a shorter way to Belinda then Alliance had to Galv, that is very true. <br />
But the &quot;advantages&quot; Alliance have/had wasn't laying on Belinda/Galv. It's the main base. <br />
For Horde to get into Alliance base, we need to cross an open bridge where we have no cover from NPC fire, while Alliance has loads of buildings and mostly avoidable NPC fire. (And no bridge). Not that it does much dmg anyways. But it's the principle.<br />
Back when you could actually bring the wing commanders outside the keep, Alliance had an advantage there as well, as the Graveyard capture point in Alliance base was/is directly outside the keep. Which meant Horde would have to be careful with pulling the wing commanders while the GY was being captured (in case of wipe, Alliance could recap easily).<br />
While last Graveyard capture point inside Horde base, is past the keep, and over a bridge.. Which made it a lot safer to pull wing commanders out, cause it was easier to defend that capture point while commanders were getting killed.<br />
<br />
But how things are now I don't really care about.. I lost interest for pvp, as soon as resilience gear and arena came out.</div></div><hr />

But the &quot;advantages&quot; Alliance have/had wasn't laying on Belinda/Galv. It's the main base. <br />
For Horde to get into Alliance base, we need to cross an open bridge where we have no cover from NPC fire, while Alliance has loads of buildings and mostly avoidable NPC fire. (And no bridge). Not that it does much dmg anyways. But it's the principle.<br />
Back when you could actually bring the wing commanders outside the keep, Alliance had an advantage there as well, as the Graveyard capture point in Alliance base was/is directly outside the keep. Which meant Horde would have to be careful with pulling the wing commanders while the GY was being captured (in case of wipe, Alliance could recap easily).<br />
While last Graveyard capture point inside Horde base, is past the keep, and over a bridge.. Which made it a lot safer to pull wing commanders out, cause it was easier to defend that capture point while commanders were getting killed.<br />
<br />
But how things are now I don't really care about.. I lost interest for pvp, as soon as resilience gear and arena came out.<br />
<br />
While I think your GY point was totally valid, I still think the Horde has a field advantage otherwise. FW keep requires you to run through a small area, then up stairs and uphill between two towers, which Hordies can easily just stand upon and rain death upon you. You can of course do nothing. On the other side of the map, pre bridge, Horde can scale the mountains around SPGY and rain fire down there too. Its much easier to attack/defend with the high ground.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, again, how ridiculous it is that Horde can reach the Ally captain before we can... I mean.. if they could reach Galv before Allys reaches Balinda.. whatever.. Back in the day I had seen a group of 10 people engage Balinda before my team even got there.<br />
<br />
People should also quit calling this a PVE fight. Without your opponents, you could EASILY take down your opponents commander. This isn't about your struggles versus the AI controlled NPCs, this is purely about defending your own bases/captains/commanders.<br />

Skill? No. Just no to that. Skilled players are on both sides. More willing healers? Maybe, but I can't be absolutely certain that seals the deal. I have been in bgs where the horde had four healers and alliance had none, just to still win without. Racials? Maybe, someone has the numbers to support that. I do not. Morale? Ahh, maybe! Rarely do I hear strategies discussed, or any constructive/informative communication on alliance side. I had to explain to this CAPS LOCKer in temple of kotmogu that merely keeping two orbs isn't a win if we don't take the middle for the higher points. Lack of alliance pvp guilds and abundance of horde pvp guilds? That would bolster morale in individual match ups if more alliance guildmates rolled together in bgs, but by itself might not be concrete enough. I offer no answers, just questions. I hear no dialogue with the developers as to address this problem, though I wish they would. I do hear horde players trying to remove the alliance's only two winning bg's, yet alliance can only blacklist two from the 9 we are less successful at.</div></div><hr />

I play both horde and alliance, i play since the ever start of WoW.<br />
<br />
People saying AV is unbalanced and theres never been anything done about it....? How about your spawn got a few yards closer?<br />
IoC...Alliance get the docks closer, Horde get the gunship. May i also remind, the glaives can be destroyed in 10 seconds by merely 3 rogues....?<br />
<br />
Now the fact people are judging &quot;Horde&quot; and &quot; alliance&quot; is discriminating to say the least, as without a doubt the best players play alliance (They are only a few though, check arena standings), and the most PvE oriented players (who are often worse in pvp) play horde.<br />
<br />
In my oppinion the reason behind the win/loss ratio is the newer players all pick alliance. I just notice when i play alliance, my team consists of players who reached lvl 90 in 2013 allot.<br />
However when i play on my horde, i notice players who got their achievements dated to 2008 (Achievement implented), wich basicly mean they are allot more experienced.</div></div><hr />

Its not been fun in the slightest, because the Alliance is actively ignoring the objective. Alliance Healer ran off from WW Flag whilst Horde were there and left me and one other DPS to die. EotS people don't call inc to bases or when fight in Mid even fight where the Flag spawns so Horde can chain cap.<br />

<br />
I agree that there are imbalances in the game design itself (maps, racials, the blacklist, etc), but my guess is that most of it stems from what could be called social issues. Things along the lines of PVPers tending to favor horde (as it is perceived as more war-like or whatever), defeatist attitudes, and others.<br />
<br />
Regardless of the reason though I wholly place the blame on the devs. Their battleground design philosophy hasn't changed to any great degree since battlegrounds were first introduced, at a time when they were little more than a fun distraction. Take pretty much any other game with team based PVP these days and it's immediately obvious how outdated their design is.</div></div><hr />

To the people crying out about how AV and IoC favours alliance because of the map design, you have to realize that the problem is greatly noticeable because AV and IoC are blacklisted more than any other BG by the horde, to the point where queue times for AV and IoC are equal for horde and alliance, which cannot be said about any other BG. Also the size of AV and IoC are 4 times than others player-wise, which is statistically important because the way the data is gathered. For every bg win/loss, there are 80 entries statistically, and when combined with the fact that most other horde blacklist AV/IoC, you're looking at a bg where there are more horde queuing for it to AFK for the little honor gains. Faster queues for this bgs, more people fitting in them, more cycles, = more AFK honor and therefore more AFKers, which contributes more to the loss ratio for horde than any other bgs.<br />
<br />
Combine all these statistically relevant things, the win/loss ratio on IoC and AV is no where near as telling as the whole story.</div></div><hr />

Of course, &quot;balance&quot; here means &quot;Make me win, Blizz. plz.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you had your balance, your queues would explode within half a year. Alliance would stop queuing, because it'd just be one more in-game representation of Blizzard's admitted Horde bias. You've got the best racials, and have had them for ages now. In a game as homogenized as WoW, it's only natural that even advantage as small as racials are a pull towards playing Horde. Remove or balance racials much more closely, and then sure, we can look at actual balance in IoC/AV. Not your balance, of course. Actual balance. <br />
<br />
I don't get why it matters, though. You can blacklist the two battlegrounds that you aren't at an advantage in, so why does &quot;balancing&quot; them matter to you? I can't (And wouldn't, if I could. I'm not a child) blacklist the 9 BGs I'm at a disadvantage in.</div></div><hr />

IF (pay attention to that word) you just get conquest only from random bgs based off of those blacklists, it would take the average alliance player 94.5 more minutes a week to cap, not including queue times. Getting a full conquest set would take an alliance player 20.58 more hours (or 1234.94 minutes) a season. If you really believe that gap is acceptable, you are delusional.</div></div><hr />

take in the result of all bgs the result is very slightly in hordes favour, but its practiaclly 50/50 (~52/48 horde advantage)<br />
with out those 2, its ~ 60/40 horde advantage<br />
<br />
so it takes the high amount of wins from those 2 bgs alone to make it even for the other 9<br />

i would gladly take the longer rand q times for a greater chance of winning the other 9 and im sure many alliance would too instead of relying on 2 bgs</div></div><hr />

If both teams rush flawlessly; alliance team will always win.<br />
With towers you get knockoffs, for bunkers that can be prevented.<br />
Tower/bunker placement is also more benefical for the alliance side, the first bunker is placed off to the side.<br />
While all towers are placed directly on the fastest route up. <br />
Towers are also &quot;easier&quot; to cap, theres only one mob that has to die and it is easier losed.<br />
With the bunkers, theres 2 mobs that has to go down and these are harder to los (far from impossible, there is a sweet spot but your average player will not use this). <br />
<br />
The bridge is also a way better choke point than what the horde have. Ranged can really dominate that bridge, on the horde side it is simple to rush that narrow corridor when you have walls to los behind. <br />
Still a fun bg, if anything should be done; make it slower / impossiburu to rush.</div></div><hr />

IF (pay attention to that word) you just get conquest only from random bgs based off of those blacklists, it would take the average alliance player 94.5 more minutes a week to cap, not including queue times. Getting a full conquest set would take an alliance player 20.58 more hours (or 1234.94 minutes) a season. If you really believe that gap is acceptable, you are delusional.<br />
<br />
horde spends those 20 hours in queue...</div></div><hr />

AV favored horde in the beginning. Then they moved horde entrance in patch 2.4 further away and it has been this way since then.<br />
<br />
it never favored horde. horde had faster bel, alliance had everything else, chokepoints, better towers etc. now alliance has everything.<br />
<br />
in the end, horde has the same right to complain about broken BGs as alliance does about racials. But to be honest, if even symetric BGs like kotmogu are dominated by horde by pretty big margin, its hardly only about racials.</div></div><hr />

I'm playing for the Alliance and my win/lose ratio is about 90% of wins (and yes, I've banned all 40 ppl BG's because of long queues there, so it's not from AV or IoC).

Horde joins AV or IoC and starts with the feeling of beeing destroyed in minutes. Alliance in many other BGs. No wonder when that happens. My Alliance Main played some 3k BGs and won some 2,2k. Of course as healer and mostly not in a group. I never understood why Alliance is complaing so much. If Horde would start to defend their stupid towers in AV or just ignore the workshop in IoC things would change. But no, they insist to play their strange tactics.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhelyo</div><div class="date">2014-01-20, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, so Arathi Basin= Horde 60% to Alli 40%(20% losing ratio not good or even close to your 50%) Warsong Gulch=47.4% Alli to 52.6 Horde ( The only one close to your so call dream ratio. still almost a 6% discrepancy) EOS= Alli 44% to horde 55%( 10% no even close). SOTA= 34%Alli to Horde 68%(That's 30% not even close) TP= 42% Alliance 57% to horde (12% not close.) BFG= 42% to Alli 57% horde ( 12% diff) ToK= 41% Alli to 58% Horde(17% diff) SM= 35% Alli to 64% horde( 30% diff again) DG= 42% Alli to 57% horde ( 15% diff.) <br />
<br />
So I say again we only have 2 BGs as ally and you still complain and moan that they should be taken away. didn't they ever tell you you being greedy is bad.<br />
<br />
That is wrong dude.Lets see how your statistics are at 50/50 w/l for both factions.<br />
AB-H60% vs A40% (that is 10% in favor of horde to the mark of 50/50 that the ideal w/l should be for both factions),i dont know where u pull the 20% crap<br />
WG-H47,4% vs A52,6 (that is a 2,6% in favor of Alliance) not that big deal (u called that 6% remember ideal w/l should be 50%-50% for both factons<br />
EotS-A44,4% vs H 55,6% (5,4% in favor of Horde)<br />
Strand-A31,7% vs H68,3% (18,3% in favor of Horde) <br />
AV-A78,2% vs H21,8% ( 28,2% in favor of Alliance)<br />
IoC-A84,9% vs H15,1% (34,9% in favor of Alliance)<br />
Twin Peaks-A42,7% vs H57,3%(7,3% in favor to Horde)<br />
BfG-A42,1% vs H57,9%( 7,9% in favor to horde)<br />
ToK-A41,9% vs H58,1% (8,1% in favor to horde)<br />
Silvershard mines-A35,5% vs H64,5% (14,5% in favor to horde)<br />
Deepwind-A42,1% vs H57,9% (7,9% in favor to horde)<br />
<br />
Now if you look at all statistics it is true that horde win ratio is better than alliance on most bgs,but u have to admit that the difference in w/l is not that great.I mean come on in 10 games played on many of those bgs alliance wins 4 and horde wins 6 (w/l &lt;10%)<br />
It's true that Strand 18,3% and silvershard 14,5% which favors the horde are a bit high and they should take a look at them(but its mostly player skill and such).<br />
Now take a look at AV/IoC (28,2% and 34,9%).Don't you see something wrong there?<br />
My point in all this is that most bgs that people say its horde dominated,the w/l ratio between both factions are &lt;10% and are close to the 50/50.But IoC and AV w/l ratio is too overwhelming.<br />
<br />
If i were to blame anyone i would probably blame the hk premades which are made especially by the russian servers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">illumnat</div><div class="date">2014-01-20, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In AV, if the Horde defends at Galv, they usually win. Otherwise the Alliance wins usually due to Zerg.<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
Regarding AV, I do consider it biased. If players listen and DKs/Paladins rush FW Towers, Alliance can be still killing Galv whilst FW are being capped. On the other hand, I consider SSM to be Horde biased due to ease of access to both Lava and Mid Carts.<br />
&lt;snip&gt;<br />
<br />
If Horde were to defend AV, you would see a different result in that BG. Gear and Healers in smaller BGs are much more important than in the 40 Man PVE Raids (AV/IoC). Looking at BGTargets, you can often tell which team will win based on HP and Healers.<br />
<br />
These are my Personal opinions. I've recorded the last 100 BGs I played (4th Jan - 18th Jan) and will hopefully post the results of my experiences soon, when I organize them.<br />
<br />
The problem with Horde and AV is that players think it's a zerg race to the boss. However, the map isn't designed that way. <br />
<br />
In order for Horde to win, they need to play a defensive game and therein lies the problem. Playing AV defensively means a match that lasts a good 10-15 minutes longer for Horde to win. Unfortunately, that leaves us with two problems... 1) the &quot;OMG my honor-per-hour&quot; crowd would rather lose AV quickly than play to win and 2) new players think that you have to &quot;race to the boss&quot; to win. With these two factors, many Horde who like to play to win end up blacklisting AV.<br />
<br />
I know that Horde can win AV. I regularly run with an AV premade group... we play defensively and we win... even if we have only 15 people in the match, we win. We let the pugs push offensively while we back-cap and defend our base. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which... in AV pugs, you seldom see Horde back-capping while Alliance regularly sends 5+ to recap their bunkers.<br />
<br />
Yep... Horde has to play defensively to win AV.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
doesnt the graph show that on mirrored maps that the side that is better (gear/skill/teamwork) at pvp seems to win more and that on non mirrored maps the side with the map advantage will win more<br />
because the design so favors one side enough to be able to overcome the skill/gear/teamwork factors.<br />
<br />
graph says horde is wining most BG but most BG are mirrored so that means its a gear/skill/teamwork win. But on maps where its not mirrored one side or the other (which ever the map favors)<br />
steam rolls most of the time. (non mirrored maps are just bad design)<br />
<br />
Non-mirrored maps are fine. Players who don't understand the strats needed to play those BGs are what's wrong.<br />
<br />
Horde does fine in AV if they play defensively. Horde does fine in IoC if they take docks/kill glaives.<br />
<br />
**BUT** 99% of the time (ok about 80% of the time according to the graphs), Horde does neither so they lose.</div></div><hr />

With such a large sample size I don't think it's possible to be something like player skill. <br />
<br />
My (granted) anecdotal evidence suggests that the same players that make up one faction are the same caliber of players that make up the other faction, especially now, 9 years into the game's life.<br />
<br />
I will say this though, I've been PvPing the same spec/class combo (Feral Druid) for nearly 9 years now and I've always managed to win (approx. 56% winning percentage) more than I lose with the exception of current WoW, all done while solo queuing my way to &quot;Battlemaster&quot;, &quot;Justicar&quot;, &quot;of the Alliance&quot;, and now I nearly have &quot;Khan&quot; done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 3 BGs that need to be looked at/rebalanced are obviously Alterac Valley, Isle of Conquest, and Strands of the Ancient. That large of a disparity shouldn't be acceptable.<br />
<br />
Strands is the perfect mirror BG, if they are not winning the same as Horde is not by design.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was common knowledge that both maps favor Alliance by design. But to answer the question, the main reason is docks. The other major nodes are centered, while docks is much closer to the Alliance base, and therefore almost a guaranteed cap for them regardless of how many Horde go to try to contest it. And coincidentally, docks just happens to be the single best node on the map. As long as people protect the glaives, docks alone can beat both workshop and hangar. Horde can win, obviously, but much like in Alterac, it takes much more teamwork and effort for Horde to win than it does for Alliance, so most never bother. What these statistics show is that right now, Horde is the better faction overall in player quality, and these two maps are ridiculously imbalanced.</div></div><hr />

I understand the talk about &quot;oh, let us have AV/IoC&quot; but they have been imbalanced forever. Certainly winnable like any BG, put against an 'equal' force, Alliance can click the docks flag to it's channel completion before a character with a 40 yard range can even come close to hitting him. Docks is win...hangar is awkward to use since it's a bit slow to do what you need to do and the mid is even for both sides. All about docks.<br />
<br />
AV is a different animal and horde can win it if played well but the choke points are not conveniently placed for Horde. Bellinda when horde go for her, we need to wrap around to enter the building, alliance just run through since it's exactly at the location they travel, then towers all in sequence along the way.<br />
<br />
Since it's all about zerg now to kill a PvE target and plead on chat to find a tank and healers (which is mindblowingly annoying), those BG's are horrible to play.</div></div><hr />

I watched my EotS stats since I first found out that the wins are not being recorded correctly. It's worse than wins not being recorded, but sometimes winning EotS actually subtracts from your win stat. I first noticed when my EotS win stat was at 137 (actual wins was just shy of 170). I chanced into 4 EotS in a row before logging out to check my stats, winning all 4. When I logged out to check the armory, my # of wins was down to 134. However, all the other BG victory/battle stats appear to be correct, and overall victory/battle stats is correct, so you can figure out how many actual EotS wins you have (if you're over 100; under 100 can easily be checked via the 100 wins achievement).</div></div><hr />

in favor of the alliance over Horde, or have the margins shorter. I don't recall Horde winning more, even by a little bit than the other side.<br />
<br />
AV though, that I will contest is primarily won by Alliance. Rightfully so, the landscape is tailor made for them. Horde have to cross a bridge<br />
for crying out loud, its the best chokepoint for people to play defensively. There's a lot more landscape for them to travel to our base than<br />
vice versa, superior towers and a helluva lot less defense at the base compared to Alliance (all those cluttered enemy NPCs that players pull)<br />
and its skewed in their favor.<br />
<br />
I've always wanted them to redo the entire BG because it really is unfairly balanced. Even if we take the above statistics as &quot;fact&quot;, most of<br />
the BGs aren't landslide guarenteed wins for the Horde faction. AV on the other hand, is by a HUGE margin skewed in one's favor, which<br />
isn't fair, considering it gives the highest amount of honor and experience to date. (Does it still?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My win percentages don't match the Alliance as a whole. Some of the smaller maps can be disproportionally influences by an a least semi-competent healer (Battle for Gilneas being the prime example with only 3 nodes). In the &quot;required pvp for raiding&quot;, Temple of Kotomogu is influenced by healers, but Silvershard Mines more by crowd control (and catching up from the starting disadvantage). In guild we call them the &quot;other one&quot; and the &quot;sucky one&quot; respectively.<br />
<br />
But, as I see it, pvp isn't really about playing your character, it is about being CCed and communing with the spirit healer. Fun times. There are times when liking achievement points leads to sad situations.</div></div><hr />

This results in the horde seeming “cooler” than alliance races do with their cute child like gnomes, drunk dwarves and generic humans. The horde are going to be more appealing to players who just want to go around and face smash other players.<br />

Faction changes also don't help this because people end up with the “can't beat them, join them” mentality and faction change over to the current, and currently long standing, horde dominant side.<br />
<br />
There also appears to be more pride among horde players than alliance players as well. Most horde players I have met are more involved with the story and exhibit proud behavior in the race they have chosen to be in versus their alliance counterpart. Most alliance players I have met are not involved in the story and really seem depressed about being in the alliance.</div></div><hr />

that's absolutely not true in IoC. I've noticed after like 1000 IoC's playing as horde that alliance is doing something to destroy horde in ACTUAL pvp there as well. So many times I've looked at the scoreboard to see alliance have like 60-80 killing blows on players while the horde has like 5-10 and whenever the horde zergs either docks or workshop, they meet alliance head on and flat out lose the clusterf*** every time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You misinterpreted what I did then. Queue time is not factored. Alliance has to play 20+ hours more a season to get the same gear. And I wouldn't complain about queue when alliance gets Call to Arms for AV or IoC, horde huff and puff that week, not queuing for the CTA and randoms with the blacklist in effect. Our direct queues go from 1-2 minutes to 15-20 minutes on Call to Arms. As someone who plays both horde and alliance I can attest to the fact that queues aren't at all bad for horde.<br />

<br />
Whenever I am horde, the strategy is to zerg and when I am alliance, we send 20-30 to ws and the rest to docks. We get those kills from workshop and rezzers in the keep, not really on the road. Very few kills are attributed to the one-three hordies that know to destroy glaives. We almost always set out to defend glaives, but rarely get much resistance against them. I like IoC a lot as alliance, but if you've seen prior stats before blacklisting, IoC was a horde bg like most others. Whoever's saying it's imbalanced towards alliance must not realize this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subanark</div><div class="date">2014-01-20, 06:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With blacklisting and fact that more expert players avoid BGs they don't win as much (or don't pvp at all) means that even a small advantage balloons into a much bigger win/loss ratio. Heck back when there was battle groups, win/loss ratios would vary depending on which server group you were in.<br />
<br />
AV favors the alliance due to the horde base being more easily accessible, and the horde towers are more easily taken without killing the NPCs.<br />
<br />
I think the alliance's advantage of IoC is simply that they are able to position the glaives in a more secure location. They can if very carefully placed not only outrange the towers, but on the est side of the horde base can be placed overlooking a ledge that takes a while to get over there. If horde doesn't have experienced stealthers to take out these or is able to make a major push to take out docks alliance will win (and if they do manage this alliance will usually lose, as this is the strat they know the best). <br />
<br />
Horde advantage in other BGs (which are much more symmetrical) is either due to alliance focusing on the BGs they more easily win, or that horde have better pvp racials (which is debatable).</div></div><hr />

It's missing crucial information that one could only get from having access to the internal database.<br />
We need the median iLvl for both Horde and Alliance for wins/losses. In addition, we need something to plot out percentage of full pvp gear versus low iLvl pve gear. Perhaps including their rating.<br />
Would also be handy to know class and spec distributions on those wins/losses. This could quickly get overwhelming trying to understand what's going on -- in a reasonable manner.<br />
<br />
There are only two BG's here that should be able to speak alone: Temple of Kotmogu and Strand of the Ancients. Those are about as even as you're ever going to get.<br />
Strand I'm very curious about, but I'll never have access to the tools to parse and develop a comfortable understanding of 'why'.<br />
<br />
These numbers were taken over the past month, so it's not unreasonable to take in to account AV and IoC as blacklisted from Horde and that will, perhaps, skew the numbers -- I might even argue that it'd skew them *dramatically*.<br />
<br />
For the person who feels you should be able to PvE in PvP gear (albeit not as well) and PvP in PvE gear -- they tried that in early MoP. People whined because players had PvP gear and were PvE'ing and they aren't trying as hard! People complained so they did a huge PvP nerf to gear that they now regret -- especially with the Timeless Isle &quot;PvP&quot; (I use quotes because they broke it and I won't count it as World PvP).<br />
<br />
As far as the World PvP option -- in my opinion PvP should be supreme. If you don't want to PvP on a PvP server -- realm transfer off. No one is forcing you to stay on a PvP serve. You'll do yourself, and your community, a favor by leaving to somewhere else you'll have more fun.</div></div><hr />

I was trying to reinforce what you said actually, then went off from there. Horde can win IoC the same way alliance does: Wipe the enemy force at workshop and take docks. Horde needs to stop putting any faith in hangar and just leave it be.<br />

/agreed. Alliance can definitely win SSM, but our best strategy, unlike horde's &quot;zerg the short tracks&quot; strategy, is to change the tracks on the two you can with groups loosely between the one depot and two carts. Cool thing about SSM though is the importance of stealthies switching tracks and letting the opposing team take the now super long tracked carts, just to be taken from them later by stealthies ganging up on them.</div></div><hr />

Though i'm assuming all BGs are played the same amount, which we know is not true<br />
The Oqueue say the same that this graph, but the alliance still win more Bgs (Adding all the bgs) in total than the horde, and that have an explanation: bgs aren't played in the same amount.<br />
The most played Bg are AV and IOC<br />

It would be interesting to see the reasons for which people blacklist it. I know a lot of people don't like vehicles. Personally, I love IoC's mechanics but I can't stand losing every time (horde, obv) so I blacklist it. Such a shame, but what can they do? :(</div></div><hr />

I really wish there were more horde that understand this, backcapping wins the game. That being said, as someone who right now plays mostly alliance, I will admit how easy the towers down south are to defend after being capped. One entrance, really small interior, the flag in the middle is solid so it helps a little more with preventing knock backs. Trying to defend the bunkers from backcappers is near impossible. They're much bigger than the towers, plenty of open space for knock backs to be advantageous and any alliance not noticed can retake the bunker while line of sighted from distracting players/combatants. Horde do have the advantage though if it comes to turtling with the chokepoint and highground after the first two bunkers, aside from the bridge.</div></div><hr />

You can have a perfectly symmetrical BG (like Strand) and the stats can be way off. This is due to any fluctuation (luck, or some good team queueing a lot) can encourage people who are losing to try another BG, and let the winning side who has more experience continue to steamroll newbs who don't know better.<br />
<br />
The primary way to &quot;fix&quot; this particular issue is to simply to add horde v horde and alliance v alliance for non-rated BGs. This will partially fix the issue, although having mixed teams or horde and alliance will fix it further.<br />
<br />
Racial balance can be examined better at the arena level, although there might be some racials that work better in BGs (I would think goblin and worgen movement racials work better in BGs).</div></div><hr />

GotN is garbage. If it were a flat 20% heal, then maybe. But it's not, it's over 15 seconds. And it's on a 3 minute CD. That is shit. Sprint is ok. Escape Artist is ok because it doesn't do much for real crowd control. It just fixes movement. It's not like breaking out of a REAL CC that keeps you from being able to cast or attack and there is no DR for slows or snares which reduces its effectiveness when the effect can just be reapplied almost instantly. Shadowmeld is ok because it drops you from being a target and stealths you. That's nice. Stoneform, again, is only ok. The weapon specializations? Meh. So you get a very slight increase in constant damage. Considering most PvP favors burst over sustained damage (due to healers almost always being OP), the weapon specializations are nothing great.<br />
<br />
And, by the way, I never said they had no uses. I said they were worse than Horde racials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what the deal is with IoC, but AV definitely favors the Alliance by a small but significant amount when it comes to a pure race... which is all that 90% of the games there amount to. Would be nice if the horde played more defensively/smarter rather than just zerging, since alliance will pretty much always have the advantage in pure zerg AV.

But now every Horde player with a brain blacklists them, which means the average skill/gear level of Horde players in AV and IoC is vastly lower, which causes more Horde players to blacklist them, which causes more Alliance players to not blacklist them as they become easier and easier wins, which causes more Horde to blacklist them...<br />
<br />
The spillover of &quot;better&quot; (on average) Horde players into non-AV/IoC BGs is what causes the Horde win/loss ratios to be a bit higher there.<br />

A better fix would be to randomize starting points. I mean, the SotA statistics should leave any ally in here speechless. As much as I hate SotA for its utter randomness, it is in many ways the most fairly designed bg (apart from not being very good).<br />
Perhaps all BGs should be played twice over, once from each starting point?<br />
<br />
I have another fix I'd like to suggest: The PvE bosses in AV and IoC needs at least 3x as much hp. Have you looked at the scoreboard at the end of an ally IoC rush? The amount of healing being dished out is pathetic. The boss goes down so fast that I can get killed inside the hold and have the game over signal go while I'm still waiting for the hold gy ress to complete. Any defense play goes straight out the window with this idiocy.</div></div><hr />

(Even if the horde win in 10-15 BG, the alliance still won more than lose in the total recount of bgs played, because alterac and IOC are played with much more frequently than 10/15 Bg's)<br />
<br />
well the info says the data was gathered from around 7mill subs wich means EU and US.and in total alliance might have the higher win ratio but per player that wouldnt be true...due to them losing 9 other bgs ^^ while hordes changes of winning are higher on 9 and low 2 that they can B-List thats what i think some people want to show here.When you see it from 1 players view.Thats IF this data is anywere near accurate...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Constraint</div><div class="date">2014-01-20, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">bg blacklisting was a great idea in principle, but turned out disastrous. it is also the main reason queue times are horrible.<br />
<br />
That, my friend, is nonsense. If BG blacklisting was the main reason why queue times are horrible, then, logically speaking, as soon as a Horde player queues for AV or IoC, their queue should be instant. Think about it. If that's what Alliance queue for and Horde don't.<br />
<br />
That's impossible for a number of reasons. Firstly, although it's possible for Horde to blacklist both AV and IoC, it CERTAINLY isn't possible for Alliance to blacklist every other BG in the game besides AV and IoC, unless you're suggesting that Alliance as a whole simply don't queue for randoms, they just queue for specific BGs, forgoing the extra CP/HP for randoms. <br />
<br />
As soon as Alliance hits &quot;queue&quot; when they join a random BG, the game doesn't just think, &quot;I'll only allow these guys to queue for AV and IoC, since, they win more here.&quot; And equally, when Horde hit &quot;queue&quot;, they game doesn't think, &quot;Fuck these guys. Instead of giving them a magical instant queue for AV and IoC (lol) I'm going to force them to wait 12 minutes in the OTHER bg queues, since they win more over there.&quot;<br />
<br />
Secondly, how is it even remotely difficult to ascertain that the reason for horrible queue times is simply because of faction imbalance..? We all know it's the case. It's been the case for some time now. The ratio is simply too heavily skewed in favor of Horde. For a tiny example, say 50k Horde players are actively queueing, and 30k Alliance players actively queueing. The Alliance players are close-to-instantly matchmade with 30 horde players (who've been in queue for ~12 minutes). The Horde players who can't queue instantly are forced to wait until either Alliance players finish their BGs or new Alliance players are queueing. It's not a difficult concept to work out. The &quot;snowball effect&quot; is only kept under control by the fact that there's a limited number of Horde players queueing, and the fact that people are increasingly put off queueing the longer the queue is (simple logic).<br />
<br />
TL;DR - blacklisting has absolutely nothing to do with queue times, as clearly proven by the fact that Horde, the most populous faction, do not have instant queues when they specific queue for AV or IoC. Faction imbalance is the sole reason for long queue times for Horde.</div></div><hr />

The focus of those BGs aren't actually killing the commanders though. They aren't very hard to kill for a reason. Originally AV was about a push war. Not its become a commander zerg, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand what you're trying to say. You say a better fix would be to randomize start points, then you clearly prove that the only BG which DOES randomize start points (SotA) has the BIGGEST Horde victory percentage..?<br />
<br />
I think there are a few reasons why Horde's dominating most BGs, and I don't think it has too much to do with start points. <br />
<br />
Yeah, Horde racials are effortlessly stronger than Alliance's. Hopefully this'll be changed soon. <br />
<br />
Also, Horde, sitting in queue for a lot longer, would, I imagine, be more determined to make the most out of their more limited BG time than an Alliance player, who can get instant queues whenever and wherever they like. No-one likes sitting through a 12 minute queue just to lose over and over. Of course, no-one likes to sit through an instant queue just to lose over and over either, but it's still a factor. This doesn't solve the mystery that Horde have longer queue times to begin with, it might simply help explain why Horde win more often than Alliance.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, perhaps the age-old adage is correct - more PvPers choose Horde because they look more &quot;badass&quot;, or &quot;warlike&quot;. This is obviously completely subjective, but it's been going around since Vanilla, and I certainly haven't seen any evidence to the contrary.<br />
<br />
IoC was always a completely flawed BG. There's simply no mechanic WHATSOEVER to force or guide players into mass PvP conflict. It almost ENCOURAGES you to avoid the other faction, which is retarded. Sure, there are exceptions, but there always are.<br />
<br />
As for AV - anyone who's played in the old days weeps for what once was. Sure, it's faster now, but who fucking cares? I wouldn't trade fun for speed any day, month or year. It's no longer a battle of push and shove, it's just a rush to the end hoping that your towers stay capped and theirs don't. Where do I sign up!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">illumnat</div><div class="date">2014-01-20, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I strongly argue with a lot of those percentages given how long I've been playing this game. If anything, those percentages should either be<br />
in favor of the alliance over Horde, or have the margins shorter. I don't recall Horde winning more, even by a little bit than the other side.<br />
<br />
AV though, that I will contest is primarily won by Alliance. Rightfully so, the landscape is tailor made for them. Horde have to cross a bridge<br />
for crying out loud, its the best chokepoint for people to play defensively. There's a lot more landscape for them to travel to our base than<br />
vice versa, superior towers and a helluva lot less defense at the base compared to Alliance (all those cluttered enemy NPCs that players pull)<br />
and its skewed in their favor.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a Horde player... we have 2 really good choke points. The choke point at Iceblood GY and the choke point on the hill leading up to our base. It's just a question of if enough Horde are willing to play defensively for it to matter.<br />
<br />
There is only one way past Iceblood. You need to have a stacked defense there though. Some up front towards where the roads come together just past IB tower and some a little further back by Tower Point to catch the stragglers that make it through.<br />
<br />
We can hold off the Alliance indefinitely at our gate if we're willing to do it. I've played in some Horde AV premades where we have a strat called &quot;Sweaty Armpits.&quot; Basically, we let the Alliance take all of our towers and wait for them at our base. We then hold them off at our gate and whittle them down until they run out of reinforcements. Yeah... it takes quite a while, but it is doable... even with as few as 20 in the premade.<br />
<br />
The bridge is a great chokepoint as well, but it's not insurmountable. Horde has to make a concerted group push across the bridge and through the Alliance that are fighting at the end of it. Too often, Horde stops on the bridge and doesn't push through. In order to succeed on the bridge, they need to rush as a group straight through to the aid station and cap it to keep the Alliance from rezzing back there.</div></div><hr />

If it were a flat 20% heal, then maybe. But it's not, it's over 15 seconds. And it's on a 3 minute CD. That is shit. Sprint is ok. Escape Artist is ok because it doesn't do much for real crowd control. It just fixes movement. It's not like breaking out of a REAL CC that keeps you from being able to cast or attack and there is no DR for slows or snares which reduces its effectiveness when the effect can just be reapplied almost instantly. Shadowmeld is ok because it drops you from being a target and stealths you. That's nice. Stoneform, again, is only ok. The weapon specializations? Meh. So you get a very slight increase in constant damage. Considering most PvP favors burst over sustained damage (due to healers almost always being OP), the weapon specializations are nothing great.<br />
<br />
And, by the way, I never said they had no uses. I said they were worse than Horde racials.<br />
<br />
Yeah stoneform is soooooooooooo good and escape artist is probably the most insane skill in the game, there is 1 good racials for PvP on alliance, 1, unless you are totally out of this world crazy ofcourse, and that's Every man for himself.<br />
<br />
Yeah, but EMFH is better than any other racial for pvp. You get a free trinket. There's nothing better than that.</div></div><hr />

in AV horde has far worse base defense NPC-wise so its piss easy for alliance to cap the towers and protect them too. (horde archers cant shoot inside, in alliance towers atleast 2 archers can prevent flag capture, Dun Baldar gy can be interrupted by alliance tower archers)<br />

Archers are really a non issue. You can just have one person aggro and kill them while another caps. Horde has a better base. Its easier to defend FW keep. You run uphill, through gates, into a tiny room, then uphill again between towers. Horde and their archer can stand around/in towers and just aoe and defend. SPGY is easy to assault as Horde.

Anyone mind saying how Horde racials are better than Alliance?<br />
More damage/burst racials, as well as the AoE Stun/Silence.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, it's just a self-fulfilling prophecy. Horde is viewed as the 'better' faction, so many of the better players switch to Horde, leaving the Alliance with the worse players. You'll notice that most of the top rated teams in both rated battlegrounds and 3v3/5v5 arena are Horde. At that point it's not about FOR THE HORDE vs FOR THE ALLIANCE, just minmaxing for any possible advantage you can get.<br />

PvE is in a similar position, with many of the top Alliance guilds switching to Horde.</div></div><hr />

It really got bad during MoP when a number of top Alliance PvE guild went Horde due to racial imbalances. It started a bit of a domino effect that most certainly bled into PvP, look at the the top arena teams or RBGs teams, almost all are horde. The actual players by and large on both factions are of equal skill and gear in random BGs, it's all about racials and success breeding success at this point. <br />
<br />
I've been playing for a long time strictly as a solo queuing type from random BGs and it was NEVER this bad. I'm not sure what Blizzard can do though, if they just equalize racials, why would all the people who faction swapped to horde come back to the alliance? Faction pride? People don't really care about that, it's about min/maxing and no one will be spending money for no reason.<br />
<br />
If they &quot;just&quot; equalize the racials there wouldn't be incentive for top pve and pvp players to come back to the alliance. But something needs to be done, it's just unfun to have to use something like oqueue or you lose 6 or 7 out of 10 games.</div></div><hr />

I know what you are saying it is a bit unbalanced but not so much the horde would lose that much . Notice the other thing about those 2 BG's is that they have a PVE side to them . Over the years I notice most horde players will totally ignore the BG objectives in AV and Isle so they can kill alliance players ...for example Horde rarly guard towers or grave yards . The funny thing is the horde would win almost ALL AV's if they would turtle the alliance at Galv ...forces alliance back to the starting cave and then the horde bottle neck them at the northern pass ...and win by reinforcements</div></div><hr />

It was a lot more balanced in Wotlk and beforehand. This is the same data mining proces done at the start of Cataclysm and a year beforehand (start of Icc patch): <br />

There is a blacklisting feature now that enables players to remove two (or three?) bgs from the random bg queue, hence making every BG more unbalanced. And Every man for himself (human racial) was also A LOT stronger in Wotlk and Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

We all know AV is Alliance slanted, we are 30 seconds slower, and that's why we lose. Those 30 seconds are killing the archers/being slowed by the archers. <br />

IoC... I honestly have no idea why we lose. <br />

It comes down to Alliance avoiding PVP and the Horde looking for it. AV/IoC is a PVE zerg? Nah. AV, not only are we 30 seconds slower, but alliance ALWAYS backcaps and horde does this 5% of the time.

Outside of AV and IoC all BGs are reasonably close, Horde has outperformed Alliance a little bit but not as bad as they did during Strand of the Ancients which is identical.<br />

Horde can't get there before it is already tapped and then you can't win there simply and even if you kill the glaives there are still the catapults that brings alliance into the fortress quickly while the Gunship... well the Gunship is awful.<br />
If Docks were not so good why are Alliance players afraid of moving the flag position on docks and gunship so that they are equally far from each spawn point? It's a simple solution.</div></div><hr />

The problem is being able to blacklist battlegrounds. In 2011 the win ratio was a lot more balanced: 54 to 46 compared to ~20ish to ~80ish now.<br />
Most horde blacklist AV so it is just filled with bots.<br />
<br />
The blacklist is why the win ratio is so unbalanced now not the map.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frankyice</div><div class="date">2014-01-21, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The simple fact that Horde shows such a major advantage in every BG that is entirely or nearly identical for both factions shows that Horde is better at PvP.<br />
<br />
We can disagree about the reasons. Personally, my opinion is that the average Horde player is probably older and more experienced. They are also probably more likely to look at all aspects of their character and options before making a race decision (instead of simply choosing someone that looks like them anthropomorphically, like Alliance races).<br />
<br />
These factors generally favor Horde, because the minor advantage in racials (yes, Horde's are better, but this is a very minor actual BG difference) causes better players to join Horde more often and THAT is what makes the huge difference.<br />
<br />
Alliance PvP racials: Every Man for Himself (strong, frees up a trinket slot), Stoneform (weak), Gift of the Naaru (weak/medium), Escape Artist (medium), Shadowmeld (weak), Darkflight (weak)<br />
<br />
Horde PvP racials: Blood Fury (weak), Hardiness (weak/medium), War Stomp (strong, probably the strongest PvP racial), Berserking (weak/medium), Da Voodoo Shuffle (weak), Will of the Forsaken (medium, would be strong without shared CD), Touch of the Grave (weak), Arcane Torrent (strong, probably the 2nd strongest PvP racial), Rocket Jump (weak, probably the weakest PvP racial, Goblins probably worst race for PvP)<br />
<br />
So out of that list, War Stomp and Arcane Torrent make great differences. But Human is probably 3rd best race for PvP. The difference I suppose being that overall, there are just MORE in the Horde list. But again, this doesn't explain the UNGODLY disparity between Horde/Alliance on mirror maps.<br />
<br />
Therefore, Horde is better at PvP (on average).<br />

I guess people are afraid that if they balance IoC and AV that the Horde will start to dominate and the alliance wins will be unbalanced compared to now. AV I understand because of chokepoints but with the damn Isle, Really Horde? All you have to do is destroy the docks and disregard the stupid ass workshop. Why does the Horde always go for the damn workshop when you can just use superior manpower and take the docks away from the alliance?<br />
<br />
Because Alliance is closer to Docks flag. Period. And it's significantly closer. Alliance can cap that flag BEFORE Horde arrives, and then it's just such a cluster so that it doesn't matter that Horde can eventually take it because it takes longer than a minute to down the 20 Alliance that went Docks and glaives will be up by then. And saying that all you have to do is down the glaives doesn't negate the fact that you get them. Basically, the Horde is forced to play D no matter what while Alliance doesn't ever have to play D to win. And that's what makes that BG unbalanced. If they just moved that Docks flag about....15-20 yards north, that place would be dramatically different. The other 2 nodes are basically equidistant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If alliance does that, and the horde don't suck, the fight will still be going on when the glaives spawn. At that point, the glaives are indefensible and will die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all know AV is Alliance slanted, we are 30 seconds slower, and that's why we lose. Those 30 seconds are killing the archers/being slowed by the archers. <br />
<br />
IoC... I honestly have no idea why we lose. <br />
<br />
It comes down to Alliance avoiding PVP and the Horde looking for it. AV/IoC is a PVE zerg? Nah. AV, not only are we 30 seconds slower, but alliance ALWAYS backcaps and horde does this 5% of the time. Even when we do guard the towers, those 4-5 people get overrun by the 12-15 alliance that are backcapping.<br />
<br />
Where does the Horde/Alliance wave meet?</div></div><hr />

I'd rather they were all balanced, which they nearly are, the outliers are problems - I'm sorry if you can't see that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
for crying out loud plzzzzz stop using this as an excuse<br />
all it takes is 2 ppl out of 40 to kill both glaives, 1 if ur exceptionally skilled, they only have 1.2mill hp, thats pretty weak as it is<br />
<br />
same can be said abt av, i havnt been to drek in ages as i always go with 3-4 ppl including myself to back cap towers<br />
80% of the time there is only 1-2, 3 tops defending the towers<br />
the times i lost av is when horde have like 5-7 players back capping and wipe us out and our tower defenders<br />
<br />
I know, that's why I put in casual/pug groups - I've never played IoC outside of this format, but I imagine getting your group to send over a small division of stealth/burst DDs is a lot easier when the group isn't made up entirely of people with a split division of tactics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sidhebane</div><div class="date">2014-02-07, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is wrong dude.Lets see how your statistics are at 50/50 w/l for both factions.<br />
AB-H60% vs A40% (that is 10% in favor of horde to the mark of 50/50 that the ideal w/l should be for both factions),i dont know where u pull the 20% crap<br />
WG-H47,4% vs A52,6 (that is a 2,6% in favor of Alliance) not that big deal (u called that 6% remember ideal w/l should be 50%-50% for both factons<br />
EotS-A44,4% vs H 55,6% (5,4% in favor of Horde)<br />
Strand-A31,7% vs H68,3% (18,3% in favor of Horde) <br />
AV-A78,2% vs H21,8% ( 28,2% in favor of Alliance)<br />
IoC-A84,9% vs H15,1% (34,9% in favor of Alliance)<br />
Twin Peaks-A42,7% vs H57,3%(7,3% in favor to Horde)<br />
BfG-A42,1% vs H57,9%( 7,9% in favor to horde)<br />
ToK-A41,9% vs H58,1% (8,1% in favor to horde)<br />
Silvershard mines-A35,5% vs H64,5% (14,5% in favor to horde)<br />
Deepwind-A42,1% vs H57,9% (7,9% in favor to horde)<br />
<br />
Now if you look at all statistics it is true that horde win ratio is better than alliance on most bgs,but u have to admit that the difference in w/l is not that great.I mean come on in 10 games played on many of those bgs alliance wins 4 and horde wins 6 (w/l &lt;10%)<br />
It's true that Strand 18,3% and silvershard 14,5% which favors the horde are a bit high and they should take a look at them(but its mostly player skill and such).<br />
Now take a look at AV/IoC (28,2% and 34,9%).Don't you see something wrong there?<br />
My point in all this is that most bgs that people say its horde dominated,the w/l ratio between both factions are &lt;10% and are close to the 50/50.But IoC and AV w/l ratio is too overwhelming.<br />
<br />
If i were to blame anyone i would probably blame the hk premades which are made especially by the russian servers.<br />
<br />
Not sure how your math works. A horde/alliance win ratio of 60/40 doesn't mean a &quot;10% in favor of horde&quot;. It means that the horde win 20 percentage points of the time more than alliance (60 minus 40). It also actually means that the horde win 50% more often than alliance (60 is 150% of 40). These numbers mean slightly different things, but they are both correct, and in neither case is &quot;60 is 10 more than 50&quot; actually relevant to anything</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VeraeliaBlack</div><div class="date">2014-02-18, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In AV, Horde used to be able to mount inside the gate at the starting tunnel. Alliance wasn't able to, and I suspect that largely evened out the distance/time that the two sides had. Now, Alliance is across and almost at Galv before Horde are even off the GY at Iceblood. Couple that with the jumping-the-fence thing, and it's going to be Alliance dominated. Glaives are overpowered, and most Horde go Workshop in IoC - most of them trying to do the cheapshot of getting Demos and sitting at the keep GY to one-shot people rezzing, which Alliance figured out by just steamrolling them with Glaives. If you bust the Glaives, it's almost certain Horde is going to win it. <br />
<br />
The real issue isn't the fact Alliance dominates those two BGs, the issue is that Horde absolutely crush Alli in any BG that doesn't have a PvE standpoint/can't be zerged. I've got Strand and Temple blacklisted, because I can't stand either of them; Strand, it's usually whoever's on the Offensive first wins. Horde just seem to start on O more than we do. Not sure what controls that, but I imagine balancing that out would make that one a lot more even. Over a third of all the Strands I've ever done, end up being a turtle at Yellow with people camping the stairs to stop bombs. Not very fun, just an attrition war (like most of the non-zerg AVs and IoCs turn into). People have been saying that Horde racials/PvP elements are way too strong, ever since Vanilla, and maybe now Blizz will pay attention to that fact. I'm seconding that they do comparisons with data pre-blacklisting option to get a better handle on what's adjusted what where, and how the changes between those times have reflected.<br />
<br />
But I honestly doubt even with this, the only thing that will happen is a hard nerf to Alliance in AV and IoC. If nothing changes as far as making it more even so that Horde doesn't absolutely smash Alliance in the other 9 BGs anymore, I doubt I'll be even bothering with PvP post getting my Battlemaster/Khan finished. I play Horde as well, but it's not fun when your team sits and GY camps the other side. Might be good for a laugh every once in a while, but when it happens all the time, it's hardly a thrill, or very sportsmanlike conduct.<br />
<br />
Tl;Dr - this needs to be fixed, but I highly doubt that it will be as far as balancing the other 9. Alliance is just going to see a hard nerf on the two we don't constantly lose, and non-arena/RBG PvP will continue to suck for Blue, and be amazing for Red (when they're not sitting in 45 min queues).</div></div><hr />

How was the percentage calculated for a sample of 7 million players? What was/ how was the math done - please post your fumula or calculation used. I am also highly doubtful of the accuracy of posted win ratios if they are taken armory statistics because these statistics reflect a characters entire bg data since character creation which could have been 7 years ago.<br />
<br />
The win ratio's that i have arrived at are:<br />
A horde players win probability when joining a random bg queue is ~80%( + or - 5%)<br />
An Allaince players win probability when joining a random bg queue is ~24% ( + or - 5%)<br />
<br />
These win probabilities i posted above are derived from the data aggregation and its subsequent calculation using two different methods. One method is using a wow addon called reflex. The other method is a manual aggregation of statics of new character's statistics, meaning a new character created since the release of the MOP expansion. Both the data which was compiled and gathered by reflex, when calculated matched up with the win probabilities i have calculated by manual aggregation of bg statistics for a new character. My calculations are explained below. Different mathematical calculations and different data aggregation based on probability theory arrive at similar win probability ratios. Read the rest of the of the post to find out how to do these calculations.<br />
<br />
Here are my calculations and my understanding of how win ratio's should be calculated - BG stats that are not recent should not be used. Win probability calculated from over 1,2 , 3 or more years worth of PVP or more should not be used.<br />
If you just created a new character in MOP and these were your statistics, this is how you would accurately calculate your Alliance random BG win probability for this season:<br />
<br />
Alterac Valley battles 25<br />
Alterac Valley victories 18<br />
Arathi Basin battles 13<br />
Arathi Basin victories 5<br />

Since you have no stats for silver shard mines, maybe because you blocked it, the total number of battlegrounds is 10 otherwise it should be 11. What this means is that you have a probability of 1/10 of getting into any of these battlegrounds from the random bg queue. This is important because we will now use this to calculate your overall battleground win probability when you join the random bg queue for PVP.<br />
<br />
your random bg win probability is:<br />
(1/10) * (18/25)-Alterac +<br />
(1/10) * (5/13)-Arathi +<br />
(1/10) * (2/8)-Gilneas +<br />
(1/10) * (0/15)-Eye of +<br />
(1/10) * (7/29)-Ancients +<br />
(1/10) * (6/15)-Twin Pks +<br />
(1/10) * (2/12)-Warsong +<br />
(1/10) * (1/2)-Kotmogu +<br />
(1/10) * (28/29)-Isle of +<br />
(1/10) * (4/17)-Deepwind +<br />
<br />
= .1 * .72 + .1*.384615 +.1*.25+.1*0+.1*.241379+.1*.4+.1*.16666+.1*.5+.1*.965517+.1*.235294<br />
=.072 + .0384615 + .025 + 0 +.0241379 + .04 + .016666 + .05 + .0965517 + .0235294<br />
<br />
= .3863472721 * 100 = 38.6% win ratio in the random bg queue since MOP expansion<br />
<br />
Now let us calculate alliance win probability based on your stats without the big battlegrounds. We should be leery of the large PvE centric battlegrounds, which i believe have been adjusted to balance or rather i should say skewed to create a false sense of balance between factions in PvP. Now let us remove the two big PvE centric bgs from our calculation to find out a player's real win probability. If we remove the big battlegrounds which alliance has a high probability of winning evident by the stats posted; alterac valley and Isle of conquest. So then when we remove these two bgs from the queue we have a total of 8 possible random bgs that we will queue up for, hence 1/8 (this should be 1/9 but no stats given for mines). I will also remove the Kotmogu bg from this calculation because the sample space is too small to be accurate - basically this bg was played too few times only twice. Therefore the total number of battlegrounds are 7, hence 1/7. The following calculation should be the true measure of an alliance players win probability in the random bg queue:<br />
<br />
(1/7) * (5/13)-Arathi +<br />
(1/7) * (2/8)-Gilneas +<br />
(1/7) * (0/15)-Eye of +<br />
(1/7) * (7/29)-Ancients +<br />
(1/7) * (6/15)-Twin Pks +<br />
(1/7) * (2/12)-Warsong +<br />
(1/7) * (4/17)-Deepwind +<br />
<br />
= .14286*.384615 +.14286*.25+.14286*0+.14286*.241379+.14286*.4+.14286*.16666+.14286*.235294<br />
= .239707 * 100 = 24% win probability for alliance players in the random BG queue.<br />
<br />
This 24% win probability for alliance feels right.<br />
<br />
Here is some data from a horde player who just recently created a fresh 90 in the MOP expansion. To find out the win probability in the Random bg queue of a horde player i used the following calculations ;<br />
<br />
(1/11) * (8/11)-Alterac +<br />
(1/11) * (6/10)-Isle of +<br />
(1/11) * (29/39)-Warsong +<br />
(1/11) * (19/20)-Gilneas +<br />
(1/11) * (17/21)-Arathi +<br />
(1/11) * (17/19)-Twin Pks +<br />
(1/11) * (9/11)-Ancients +<br />
(1/11) * (7/8)-Kotmogu +<br />
(1/11) * (4/4)-Mines +<br />
(1/11) * (8/9)-Deepwind +<br />
(1/11) * (7/25)-Eye of +<br />
<br />
=.090909*.727272+.090909*.6+.090909*.74359x+.090909*.95+.090909*.8095+.090909*.894736+.090 909*.818181+.090909*.875+.090909*1+.090909*.88888+.090909*.28<br />
<br />
=.78065398 * 100 = 78.06% probability of winning in the random bg queue for horde<br />
<br />
We should be leery of the large PvE centric battlegrounds, which i believe have been adjusted balance or rather i should say skewed to create a false sense of balance between factions in PvP. Now let us remove the two big PvE centric bgs from our calculation to find out a horde player's real win probability.<br />
<br />
(1/9) * (29/39)-Warsong +<br />
(1/9) * (19/20)-Gilneas +<br />
(1/9) * (17/21)-Arathi +<br />
(1/9) * (17/19)-Twin Pks +<br />
(1/9) * (9/11)-Ancients +<br />
(1/9) * (7/8)-Kotmogu +<br />
(1/9) * (4/4)-Mines +<br />
(1/9) * (8/9)-Deepwind +<br />
(1/9) * (7/25)-Eye of +<br />
<br />
=.111111*.74359x+.111111*.95+.111111*.8095+.111111*.894736+.111111*.818181+.111111*.875+.1 11111*1+.111111*.88888+.111111*.28<br />
<br />
= .806657 * 100 = 80.7% win probability in the random BG queue for a horde player<br />
<br />
When you compare this horde win probability to the alliance win probability i calculated earlier which was equal to a 24% win probability for alliance, both probabilities roughly adds up to ~100 with a + or - 5% error / deviation.<br />
<br />
Therefore i conclude that the horde are steam rolling alliance in battleground. My Statistics calculations show that they have a 80% win probability when joining a random bg queue. While alliance players have at best a 24% chance at winning a bg in a random bg queue. Please note that my statements are contingent to both of the large PvE centric battlegrounds being blacklisted and removed from win probability calculations.<br />
<br />
I have a theory that blizzard is aware of the steam rolling of alliance players in PVP and is therefore tweaking the PVE aspects of the large bgs to balance PvP between the factions. Because the statistics do not add up i suspect this. What i mean is that if the horde are steam rolling alliance in 9 out of 11 bgs by hudge margins then that begs the question why are they only losing in the big BGs that are PvE centric. <br />
<br />
<br />
In regards to my calculations I did not cherry pick the data for my calculations. I also have not biased the results of the calculations by using my own data. In my calculations that i have posted i have used only the pvp stats posted by others in the battle form thread called &quot;Dispelling a myth - Alliance win ratio&quot;. I have also written out all my calculations and the reasoning behind them. I have specifically excluded the large PvE centric bgs from both the horde and alliance win probability for reasons i explained in my posts on this thread. I used only the recent PvP stats/data that was posted in that battle.net thread, This means recent stats, explicitly mentioned by posters which correspond to MoP expansion, not 3 or more years of pvp stats. I also used only the data from the first alliance player and the first horde player who posted their pvp stats in that very thread on blizzards forum. <br />
<br />
A horde players win probability when joining a random bg queue is ~80%( + or - 5%)<br />
An Allaince players win probability when joining a random bg queue is ~24% ( + or - 5%)<br />
<br />
An alliance players win probability when including the 2 PvE bgs is about 38%<br />
A Horde players win probability when including the 2 PvE bgs is about 78%<br />
<br />
There is almost no difference in a horde players overall random bg win probability, a 2% difference when including or excluding the 2 big PvE centric bgs. However there is a big difference for an alliance player, a 14% difference in the random bg win probability for an allaince player if the 2 large bgs are included or excluded.<br />
<br />
How come a horde player only has a 2 percent difference in their win probability from the inclusion or exclusion of the two big bgs(alterac &amp; isle of..) while alternatively the alliance player has a huge percentage difference of about 14%?<br />
<br />
If you use the reflex wow addon can also accurately calculate your win ratio . The following reflex data was taken from a horde poster in the same battle.net thread. If the reflex calculations are 8 to 31 or 8:31 then you can calculate your win ratio like so:<br />
<br />
When odds of losing an event are A:B<br />
Then the probability that you will lose the even is P(E')= (A)/(A+B)<br />
Where P(E') is the probability that the event will not occur.<br />
<br />
So in your case the odds given by reflex were;<br />
8:31 = (8)/(8+31) = (8)/(39) = .205128 * 100 = 20.5% chance of losing in the random bg queue.<br />
<br />
In order to get your random BG win probability you would need to subtract the probability of losing the random BG from the total sample space. By the first axiom in probability your calculated win or losing probabilities must be between 0&lt;P(E)&lt;1. By the second axiom of probability theory the total sample space is 1, P(S) =1. There fore:<br />
<br />
P(Probability of Losing bg ) - 1 = |P(probability of wining BG) |<br />
<br />
.205128 - 1 = .7948 * 100 = 79.5% chance of winning a bg in the random bg queue<br />
<br />
An alternative way of calculating the win ratio is by If reflex shows that you won 31 bgs and lost 8 bgs, then you have played 39 total games<br />
<br />
31/39 * 100 =79.49% wins in BGs recently, this would be your most up to date win ratio with bg sample space data gathered and compiled by the addon reflex.<br />

The win probabilities compiled and gathered by reflex when calculated match up with the win probabilities i calculated using different mathematical calculations based on probability theory. Hence i believe that my predictions about alliance and horde win probability are arguably valid because similar probability is arrived at by the add-on reflex's bg win/played data aggregation which is then calculated and computed differently from the calculations and data aggregation i used based on probability theory with different sample spaces of different players. <br />
<br />
Therefore:<br />
A horde players win probability when joining a random bg queue is ~80%( + or - 5%)<br />
An Allaince players win probability when joining a random bg queue is ~24% ( + or - 5%)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
To find these numbers, we compared the number of battles and victories a character had in a December snapshot of data to a January snapshot of data.<br />
<br />
As for the rest of your post, this isn't something we talked about at all, just individual battleground ratios. If you wanted to combine win ratios in this post with weights from these numbers (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3697-Armory-Stats-BG-Popularity-Connected-Realms-Blue-Posts-Blue-Tweets-FCM-Poll), you could repeat your wall of calculations.</div></div><hr />
