Nozdormu NPC Model Video<br />
Nozdormu's model was pretty popular yesterday and I figured he was worth a short video, if you pay attention you will even notice the nice reflections on his tatoo. <br />

<br />
How is it any different to going on wowpedia or similar to look up abilities, or watching tankspot guides on encounters? A very small minority of players spend their time playing a boss blind and having to adapt with each new ability or phase reached, and even then they usually do it on the PTR so there are plenty of boss walkthroughs by the time it goes live. This is just blizz taking something that the community uses a lot and making it more readily accessible whilst playing their game. It is no different from the inclusion of their own power auras, or when SCT was added all that time ago, and just like people use alternative addons to replace the blizzard versions, so will they continue to read boss tactics and watch videos on youtube, Dungeon Journal will change nothing really.</div></div><hr />

Quit the hyperbolic QQ and stop blowing smoke. <br />
The Dungeon Journal doesn't lead anybody by the hand any more than going to a 3rd-party site and reading up on boss strategies or watching strat or kill videos does. In fact, it actually does less, so get over yourselves. It's doing exactly what Blizzard said they wanted it to do (kinda surprising, actually, that they managed to pull that off on the first pass, lol) in that it tells you what to expect, but not how to kill the boss. <br />
I'll let Nethaera elaborate (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/176567/dungeon-journal-down-the-spiral-we-go)...<br />
<br />
Regarding Spider-lock - and this is all totally subjective (obv) - the helm looks fugly even despite the nice particle effect, and the shoulders obviously aren't big enough for a T12 set, especially on the Worgen and Orc. I am disappoint...</div></div><hr />

I like the pali gear more this teir... just looks epic.... but needs the robes not the pants...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krysia</div><div class="date">2011-05-21, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The journal thingy makes perfect sense from blizzards perspective. Atm pretty much every raiding guild out there needs to go to a third party site to look stuff up (youtube, tankspot and so on), some of the less honorable sites promote goldselling and might even contain keyloggers and spyware.<br />
This way they cut out that entire problem and at the same time they also cut off several sites making money off their product (usually through advertising). It's win win.<br />
<br />
For the players however it's just another form of handholding and I doubt many of the serious raiders will actually use this over watching a video and reading actual strats from reputable sources with experience.</div></div><hr />

Nobody's QQing, dude. It's meant for the non-hardcore. The ones who are against this journal are the bleeding-edge guilds. The main reason is that the journal already reveals the fight skills(ie, Heroic Ragnaros) so they know what to expect. Previously they had to do the fight (ie, Sinestra) just to find out what she does. The journal takes the fun out of learning the heroics.</div></div><hr />

Nozdormu has the best looks out of all aspects. They better show his and ysera's unique dragon form soon too. That will be EPIC beyond proportions, if this model is anything to go by on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hardly just a recolor, the whole thing has been remodelled, the bat/gargolye creature has changed to to a dragon, and the liquid changed to sand, hopefully they changed the sand animation to be that of an hourglass too, that would be pretty cool, like the time ticking away till Nozdormu's death.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hardly a complete remodel, though. It received a higher resolution texture facelift - necessary due to Cataclysm facelift to the game overall.. The spikes on top are now graduated, with the largest being on the back of the head - minor. The blood is now &quot;sand&quot; color - minor. The head of the &quot;gargoyle&quot; being turned into a &quot;dragon&quot; was the removal of the tongue, the protrusions jutting out from the sides being faced downward as spikes, and the teeth being changed to dragon fangs - the only substantial change to the model, except for maybe the armor on the neck side of the shoulderpads, which received some attention.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's bad, but it's largely a recolor/resolution increase. The model is very much the same, which is why I made that comment. :)</div></div><hr />

Not that I'm complaining eitherway, think every 'serious' raider uses DBM anyways. ;)<br />
<br />
This is what I don´t get. Try getting into a raid guild and tell them you don´t use DBM. Try getting into a raid guild and tell them you won´t watch offsite vidis of the fight beforehand. The hardcore raiders were already using these crutches, and they mostly forced them on everyone else. Now they are in an uproar because they are being added to the game? As far as world firsts... it doesn´t matter because almost every fight is on the PTR for weeks ahead of time. Hardcore guilds are the ones on the PTR practicing the fight, they are NOT going to lose a world first to a guild that never used PTR and just used this new help guide.<br />
<br />
But that is really besides the point, the game is not and never will be built for a few thousand hardcore raiders. This change is so that when i am pugging ZG, I can tell the melee to make sure to get behind the boss when he vomits.. and instead of saying vomit, I can link the actual ability that is coming.</div></div><hr />

yeahIknowrite?<br />
How DARE they actually give you the spell information (which you can ALREADY look at by clicking the name of the ability in the combat log anyway, just fyi) and make you OPEN A TAB to see it in a list. I mean, everyone knows downloading a program that does all of this and more (in a far more screen-shaking, color-changing, chiming and altogether far more obnoxious fashion) from a virus laden Curse website is the really pro way to do this! <br />
<br />
Seriously though, this feature isn't providing anyone with initiative anything that they don't already have:<br />
1) you can read the boss abilities already, and if so inclined, write them down in a little notepad next to your mouse. Not hard. Just takes brains enough to think that checking abilities might be useful and maybe a minute to write it down. You even have a stopwatch in game. Try using it when you are dead some time to figure out cooldowns.<br />
2) pretty sure most raiders already have an addon installed created by people clever enough to do #1 (and who can program).</div></div><hr />

What do you not get? When fights first come out part of the fun is finding out the new abilities and making a strategy to fit them. The amount of information that blizzard has put in is WAY too much, we don't need to have icons for specialized abilities, know where to stand, or exactly how much damage each ability does, just tell us something like &quot;Ability X does a raid wide AOE, X second cooldown&quot;. <br />
<br />
Also early in tiers most boss mods aren't fully updated with all the new mechanics so you basically are just guessing on their CD/what to do with them. <br />
<br />
IDK why all the casuals are freaking out about raiders actually wanting a challenge this tier, not wanting to clear everything in 3 weeks.</div></div><hr />

I welcome the journal.. it looks fantastic and im glad i can finally get rid of atlas and dbm. I find it hilarious all the people complaining and bitching about it.. when i bet 99% of raiders look up how to's on youtube and all have dbm. whats the difference people?</div></div><hr />

The spiderlock set is still ugly though, its sad how those tier 12 are awful looking (and yeah i saw the other previews). They should quit this thing of theming sets after instances or just give us the apperance tab. Perhaps these ammount of bad looking sets is to leave us desperate so in the end they can put the apperance tab as &quot;premium&quot; content as well.<br />
<br />
How I miss tier 2, tier 4, tier 5, tier 6, tier 8... Those were nice ones. I do like spiderman a lot but that doesnt mean i would like to have my warlock to dress like him :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mine does, but it's primarily for laughs. We've got a long storied history of running blind into an encounter and then screaming like ninnies during said encounter.<br />
<br />
The best one to date is going into ZA for the first time the day it went live and hearing a shrill squeal come from the tauren prot warrior. &quot;OH GOD, OH GOD TAUNT HIM OFF ME! OH GOD GET HIM OFF! OH GOD GET HIM OFFFFFFFFFF MEEEEEEEEEE!&quot;<br />
<br />
It really does wonders for breaking the &quot;new content tension&quot; where everyone's ramped up and on edge. The hilarity that ensues really does relax everyone - especially during the days of perma-tree form, where it looked like your raid was interspersed with small trees who were absolutely loosing their fucking minds and just running in circles flailing.<br />
<br />
On topic though, the DJ really does look interesting. It will come in handy for people who aren't exactly succinct with their explanations of boss fights, especially as a non-tank or healer. &quot;Yeah he'll do some ability that you've gotta heal through followed by this shit you gotta kite him out of ...&quot; Thaaaaank you, Albert Schweitzer, for your stunning contribution to the mechanics of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is most definitelly built on a Night-elf.<br />
<br />
So a beard like that would probably not be enough on a male bloodelf.<br />
<br />
Still sure it's a male bloodelf ?! go make one (or log onto yours) and look at the way he stands, then make a nightelf and look how he stands, and compare it to this guy. Prettttttty obvious. Yes even if he isn't purple and he has a bloodelf haircut..</div></div><hr />
