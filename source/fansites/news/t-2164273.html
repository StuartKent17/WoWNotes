World PvP<br />
This is a topic we've been discussing a lot recently. We agree that damage feels rather high in World PvP situations and we're considering some changes. First, we removed base resilience coming into Legion because we adjusted the rate at which health pools scale with respect to damage. In the past, player damage tended to outpace a character's health pool making damage feel stronger as an expansion went on. We made some adjustments to that system but we've found through playtesting with the templates that we've had to decrease damage and increase health to get damage pacing to a good spot.<br />
<br />
In a future patch, we're considering adding in some base resilience to bring damage and health ratios closer to where they are with our pvp templates (and the adjusting those templates to compensate). It should make for better damage pacing in the outside world. We don't plan on activating templates in the outside world though. We think it's important that the game have a place where we don't make such drastic adjustments so you can feel your character's full power when fighting another player. Meanwhile, battlegrounds and arenas provide a much more structured environment for PvP gameplay.

PTR Update: Legionfall War Supplies<br />
We've made the following update on the PTR:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Broken Shore Rare Elites (16 bosses) now drop 5 Legionfall War Supplies for every kill for any players on their tap list.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you're done with the new World Quests, you can acquire Legionfall War Supplies from Rare Elites such as Doombringer Zar'thoz or Malorus the Soulkeeper.<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
You used to be the punching bag of the WoW community now the duty has fallen onto Holinka, what made you guys the target?<br />
Players knew our names. <br />
<br />
My boss during my WoW days, Tom “Kalgan” Chilton, is one of the smartest systems designers I’ve ever worked with. Even though many WoW players knew his name, he (perhaps wisely) kept a pretty low profile on social media. So, he never got nearly as much attention (good or bad) from the community.<br />
<br />
Brian and Chadd and I are more interested in reaching out to players, but as a result, they sometimes know a name to put with a design change, even if the change was made by some other designer who they didn’t know.<br />
<br />
Morello was lead designer on League for a time, and he had similar experiences. In fact, I think the first time we ever met was because players pointed out how we served similar roles, as main tank for community sentiment.

That depends, really. Serenity might care. Perhaps all they care about is getting a one up on Method after losing WF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's due to the fact, that Horde racials lead to more DPS over alliance racials for most classes. I guess that's something to consider in a setting where a couple of DPS could mean world first - or not.</div></div><hr />

And you know what? Sometimes the community does know better. Legion especially has been them trying catch up on the broken/badly balanced stuff the community pointed out in the testing phases a loooooong time ago, that they completely ignored...<br />

They are not ignoring you. They respond to almost any problem, most game devs don't even respond at all. Just because the community wants it doesn't mean they need to add it to the game.</div></div><hr />

Note that this was probably originally a typo. The blue post specifies only the Assassination template was nerfed to make up for the 4% damage buff: https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20478238/hotfixes-february-6<br />

<br />
I don't care if they respond at all to posts or tweets or anything. I care that feedback gets left by many people on an issue and it still goes live broken for weeks, maybe months. <br />
<br />
You don't have to reply to everything, you just have to fix what needs fixing. Eliminating a problem is a better response than just acknowledging it.</div></div><hr />
