Paragon VS Ragnaros 25man Heroic World First Kill Video<br />
DREAM Paragon (http://www.paragon.fi/) released their video of the Ragnaros world first kill yesterday and I didn't have the occasion to embed it. However, something weird happened during the encoding and the quality was lower than intended. Paragon reuploaded the video with that problem fixed, enjoy!<br />

What is up with people claiming Paragon members get paid for the WF's? Mayb they will get some hardware but most of the members of Paragon just have a normal job and normal life like most of the people do.<br />

They won't earn a monthsloan with killing Ragnaros, maybe a new videocard when lucky..</div></div><hr />

Called him a tool and nerd because he is saying I should download the video and watch it on 1080p. I actually watched it first on Paragon's website before on MMO. Like I said in my first post it wasn't that great for quality and editing. So yeah he is a nerd and tool.</div></div><hr />

Might as well be playing Starcraft (errr actually I wish I could pull the camera back that far) or Diablo. Blizzard as a corporation needs to learn the meaning of moderation, they seem to go overboard with every damn thing, maybe it's the 40 something male developers still stuck in their adolescence.</div></div><hr />

Love CAP... they have some amazing stuff on Jamendo, along with Josh Woodward, Project Divinity, Diablo Swing Orchestra, Atomic Cat and a bunch of others I keep trolling their site for. Nice to see them getting used!</div></div><hr />

I guess they forgot all about it. In any case i seem to have forgot to pay the subscription/lost interest in wow the last two months. The problem with WoW unlike a few other mmo's out there... When you stop playing WoW you don't get any withdrawal symptoms. Life just goes on without a single thought to the game. That is a shame. I remember playing daoc back in 2001-2005. Every time i would think about how awesome it was and the realm wars, relic fights(when they were fun) etc. Sadly WoW got nothing &quot;interesting&quot;... It's all the same over and over again.</div></div><hr />
