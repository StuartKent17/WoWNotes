Fuck it, let's make more bosses that 0.0001% of the player base MIGHT be able to kill if they spend months gearing and brute force several thousand pulls! Denying content to almost the entire player base is such a winning idea!</div></div><hr />

How do you know what Blizzard has and doesn't have for their staff? The Mythic Raiding scene has always been pandering to try hards and people who think everything is too easy in their life. Ultimately these people screw it up for the average player who doesn't take a video game as serious as real life. This is called pandering. They should just remove Mythic and Heroic and make normal a hard but not stupidly ridiculous impossible raid for 99% of the player base. If people complain it's too easy? Congrats you won! Move the fuck on already.</div></div><hr />

Possibly, but these guilds are already pushing 440+ ilvl, needing to have your raid fully titanforged for the last boss is dumb</div></div><hr />

In fairness, bosses being mathematically unkillable until blizzard nerfs them after top guilds get to them is a time honored tradition dating back to vanilla.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. In situations like this, it wasn't &quot;Oh we've got to nerf it week 2, it's too hard.&quot; It was &quot;It might be a challenge now, but once you're in the appropriate gear it'll be fine.&quot;<br />

Yeah, because we all want a world-first race to last A MONTH OR TWO like in the olden days when bosses were just plain unkillable.<br />
<br />
If you want bosses to be at a level where the best players in the world ALSO need the very best gear in the world, then when exactly do you want bosses to be killed by mere mortals? Since nerfing is apparently not on the table. You think gear progression alone can smooth out the difficulty curve enough to allow tier 2 guilds a shot? Get real.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you understand. These are the best players in the world, who already have ilvls 430-440. Their peak performance far, FAR outstrips the vast majority of players, even those who raid Mythic. The only thing that stops these guilds from completing raids within a week or two are bugs and overtuning. In the past, bosses have remained unkilled longer simply because it took more time for them to be patched.<br />
<br />
These fights cannot be overtuned so ruthlessly that Method requires a month of gearing to beat it. That means the fight is essentially impossible for everyone else who's not a world-first level raider, which is a dick move.</div></div><hr />

You think it's great that the company alienates 99% of their player base to pander to marvel-level players who have the ability to spend 24/7 (almost literally) on World of Warcraft? Imagine if they actually didn't do that? Oh that's right! They did at one point! Wrath of the Lich King: where a large majority of the Player Base actually killed the Lich King and had fun!

The problem is, if these guys are battling , not many guilds will be able to down it. I mean they playing at least 10 ilvls above the average player.</div></div><hr />

If these top guilds really want to play hardcore let them farm these ilvls for 2-3 weeks untill the boss is mathematically possible to kill. After 20-30 guilds will finish THEN nerf the fuck it.<br />
If i am not wrong Limit were already able to kill 2/3 adds in this phase so with 1 week worth of items they will be probably able to finish the raid next week anyway.<br />

As far as I know, anybody is allowed to spend their free time as they want. If you don't want to commit your time to play WoW and be good player then its your choice. You can spend your time on anything else. But if you are not willing to spend time then why complain that you can't play at highest levels? And you don't even have to play wow all day to kill last boss on mythic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, if you want to kill mythic last boss so badly, why are you talking about being average player? If your goal is not to kill hardest content then you can just kill it in any other difficulty that suits you and be done with it. <br />
Also as someone else already pointed out. I doubt that many people killed LK on hardest difficulty level.</div></div><hr />

i completely understand, but its perfectly fine if the final boss of a raid doesnt die within the first week of the raid opening, and it always has been. In no way is it a &quot;dick move&quot; for the same boss to not be killable by many other guilds for much longer even. If u havent put in the effort to gear up or put in the practice to learn the best strat for the fight like method and limit has, than why should u be able to kill it within the same timeframe as them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And tbh that's why we have 4 raid difficulties, current &quot;normal&quot; was added in MOP and lfr was added in Cata.

<br />
Yea, sure, millions of players will kill mythic Azhara. Think again, if they didn't nerf KJ, Ghun, Jaina there would be like 700 guilds with a kill. Nerfing bosses opens the chance for the &quot;millions&quot; more like 1000 guilds with a 25 player roster, do the math, 25k. 50k, if being very very generous and saying there will be 2k guilds killing if before next content release. You really didn't even thought about it, yea? <br />
If they didn't nerf it at all on the other hand.. we are looking at what? 10k players? guestimation.</div></div><hr />

Take Ashvane mythic for example, it ain't particularly fun to roll to a boss where you realise suddenly you need 100k more raid dps and have to cheese it with a 3rd tank to even have a hope to down it. Now you might say I need to move to another guild, but I'm not going to pay 45€ to kill a boss and reward Blizzard for making a boss so overtuned for casual players.<br />
<br />
<br />
The nerf is reasonable and announced well in advance (unlike shadow nerfs they used in the past).<br />
I can't see why people are complaining really.<br />

You do know they've done multiple shadow nerfs this race already? Think this is a special case where the boss is likely to be killed soon after this nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember bosses going months without dying. Was more rewarding for the team that won to claim the title.<br />
<br />
When? Outside of stuff other than some form of gating (I.E. you must farm shadow resistance gear, that you can only get from this raid to progress) or bugs/the fight being straight impossible (for instance, for a fair while C'Thuns tentacles would just throw you in the air, causing you to die from fall damage and as such was unkillable). Infact, Vanilla bosses only really took a long time due to gating, bugs or overtuning to the point of being impossible only killable once they were nerfed then the only one boss that lasted a long time was Yogg-Sarons hard mode.<br />
<br />
So, what are the bosses you rememeber? Unless your saying you long for the days of overtuned, buggy fights that were unkillable going unfixed for months. In which case... Why?</div></div><hr />

Very long-time lurker first-time poster. Often times when I read some piece of WoW news (especially if it seems like a positive/neutral change), I come to the comment section just to see the mental gymnastics employed to turn it into a negative.<br />
<br />
This one particularly boggles my mind. Leaving aside that having overtuned/buggy content just for the sake of making it harder is just bad game design, people use as reference a time when racing for the world first wasn't as competitive as it's now and you didn't have the option to do it for 6-10h every day for 11 days straight. Now, are world-first races a lot more efficient today? Yes, most certainly, but that's a trait of human nature and evolution in general.<br />
<br />
It simply doesn't matter that in terms of effective hours and number of pulls things haven't changed that much from the past. It's just bile for the sake of bile.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for Classic to go live so we see 1-2 week clears - but of course, then there's going to be something else, blizzard secretly nerfed the content or something.</div></div><hr />

But people can also kill the endboss today. They just cant do it on the highest difficulty. I can't really understand how it's pandering to the hardcore players, because there are in fact lower difficulty versions of this raid that you should be able to complete if you're not as invested in the game as they are.</div></div><hr />

Bosses didt die cause it was LFR/norm/hc/mythic baked into 1 difficulty<br />

And if they dont nerf the bosses, we end up with majority of guilds unable to clear it, ppl BITCHED that Uunat was too hard, then the ppl BITCH that hard bosses get nerfed.<br />

Combined with the first changes (debuff to 5 sec, spear nature change) will help the healing and LoS issues quite a bit. There will still need be amazing play on this phase.<br />
<br />
What this change will allow them more time to obviously kill those adds and try different strategies (possibly add another healer) allow Azshara to drop a little more in HP before the final 'burn phase'. Remember there is still an ENTIRE 50% of HP to go. We also don't know what changes occur in the final phase, and there is talk of a secret phase. Honestly this fight is already long and a secret phase shouldn't be needed. Maybe they will just add more Old God themed abilities in the final phase instead of an entire secret phase. The main mechanic of the final phase is the titan consoles so unless something drastically changes it could be an easier phase than phase 3 where everyone is stuck at currently, but I doubt it will be straight forward and new things will be added.</div></div><hr />

It's not fair to compare them to the average mythic guild, who will still take weeks/months just to get close to finishing the raid. These slight nerfs on Azshara will have no effect on guilds outside of the top 10-20. There aren't even 10 guilds on Azshara right now, and half the guilds on Azshara aren't to the point of noticing these changes. <br />

Let's just kill it in a few weeks, where is the problem?Because socketed benthic gear exists. Because top guilds stack to a degree that cannot be replicated by the vast majority of guilds. Because two weeks for those guilds is more than two months for standard mythic guilds. Because it's already almost 400 pulls for Limit. Because no boss managed to stay alive for &quot;few weeks&quot; if it wasn't bugged or absurdly overtuned to a point where next tier of gear would be needed to *maybe* kill it.<br />
Can't wait for Classic to go live so we see 1-2 week clears - but of course, then there's going to be something else, blizzard secretly nerfed the content or something.They're going to blame 1.12 for it.

Yea, sure, millions of players will kill mythic Azhara. Think again, if they didn't nerf KJ, Ghun, Jaina there would be like 700 guilds with a kill. Nerfing bosses opens the chance for the &quot;millions&quot; more like 1000 guilds with a 25 player roster, do the math, 25k. 50k, if being very very generous and saying there will be 2k guilds killing if before next content release. You really didn't even thought about it, yea? <br />
If they didn't nerf it at all on the other hand.. we are looking at what? 10k players? guestimation.<br />
<br />
My comment was anti-mythic raiding in general. Making content so hard that only 0.1% of the player base can defeat it, yet giving it the best rewards possible. It's always been a monstrous slap in the face to disabled veterans and other people who can't play at that level. That is called pandering to try-hard players.</div></div><hr />

This is a ROLE PLAYING GAME that happens to be online that people pay money every month to a company to play and have fun. This is not the tryouts for the NFL.

Right, they signed up for this and get paid by sponsors to run this. In some cases a fairly sizeable amount of money. Who decides it's unkillable? Them, or blizz? If that amount of effort isn't expected, I'm not sure what else to say.</div></div><hr />

If you don't want to commit your time to play WoW and be good player then its your choice. You can spend your time on anything else. But if you are not willing to spend time then why complain that you can't play at highest levels? And you don't even have to play wow all day to kill last boss on mythic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, if you want to kill mythic last boss so badly, why are you talking about being average player? If your goal is not to kill hardest content then you can just kill it in any other difficulty that suits you and be done with it. <br />
Also as someone else already pointed out. I doubt that many people killed LK on hardest difficulty level.<br />
<br />
That would lead to RNG being a much larger impact on who gets world first. Each week the boss doesn't die, the RNG factors goes up a lot. It's possible one guild gets zero upgrades in their reclear while the other guild gains 2-3 ilvls average for their raid. I'd say not likely in one week but the gap that could occur could easily be pretty large after a month.</div></div><hr />

sports analogies work perfectly. millions of people pay sportclubs to have fun without any aspirations to tryout for professional leagues. i always use sport analogies to explain online stuff to other people. <br />

Your comment makes no sense, so you're trying to say that even if you're quadriplegic you should be entitled to the best gear? What? You don't need the best gear if you're not raiding at the mythic level...<br />
<br />
Anyhow your comment (or anyone else's) doesn't matter, Blizzard decides what happens and mythic raiding is a core component since the introduction of hard modes in WoTLK and that's definitely not going away.<br />
<br />
Let's also not forget the recent amount of publicity for the game thanks to Mythic raiding, more than anything produced by the other &quot;99.9%&quot; of the player base.</div></div><hr />

Fuck it, let's make more bosses that 0.0001% of the player base MIGHT be able to kill if they spend months gearing and brute force several thousand pulls! Denying content to almost the entire player base is such a winning idea!<br />
<br />
I would be fine with it if it was an optional boss, like down in Azsharas basement was a monster even she was afraid of.<br />
<br />
A relatively simple boss mechanics wise that gear would eventually give everyone a chance to kill, maybe not even dropping gear just cosmetic stuff and a mount and maybe a pet.</div></div><hr />

RPG was always about being exclusive, having best gear, stats, server rep. &quot;Normal&quot; people are by definition normal. Like casual football players like myself, I play it because I want to spend some good time, not to be football start, therefore I don't need best football balls or boots, biggest paycheck. I play football on &quot;normal&quot; difficulty, with my friends. You don't need best in slot gear to clear normal raids. Mythic players do. So it is quite exclusive for them. This is WoW, gear was always locked behind hardest bosses, so if you have not noticed it in 15 years..... you are playing wrong RPG mate.</div></div><hr />

This is WoW, gear was always locked behind hardest bosses, so if you have not noticed it in 15 years..... you are playing wrong RPG mate.<br />
<br />
To be an RPG is an RPG when it can be utterly and complete broken by the right build. You can trivialize games like Final Fantasy VIII, Knights of the Old Republic or Morrowind, if you know what to do. Without exploiting bugs, using cheat codes or third party software. This already isn't possible in WoW or any RPG for that matter, because any and all broken shit is hotfixed in the name of balance.<br />
<br />
As for the best gear. It is pointless to lock the best gear behind the hardest content. Cause you don't need it for anything at all. It's just there to have something to brag about.</div></div><hr />

The real reason to farm raids. Parsing :)</div></div><hr />
