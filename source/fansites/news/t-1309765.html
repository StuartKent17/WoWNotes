Patch 5.4 - Siege of Orgrimmar Encounters<br />
Many of the bosses have unfinished or placeholder models. You can see a little bit more about why Garrosh looks like this (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=_PMSpmB8niI) during part of the fight in the encounter journal entries.<br />

Patch 5.4 Item Levels<br />
Ghostcrawler gave us an idea of the item levels we will see on Patch 5.4 loot.<br />

<br />
Patch 5.4 Class Changes<br />
Kil'Jaeden's Cunning Feedback<br />
The simple fact is that the constant, passive ability to perform a complete DPS rotation while moving was never intended to be a core feature of the Warlock class. Those who remember the early days of Patch 5.0 will recall that, initially, Kil’Jaeden’s Cunning actually increased cast time whenever it was triggered. In those days, that extra cast time made the talent so unattractive that very few players actually took it. We decided to try it as only a snare instead, but that has had the opposite effect: in Patch 5.3, virtually all Affliction Warlocks are using Kil'Jaeden’s Cunning. Remember, we want talents to be meaningful choices. If one talent is far and away superior to its neighbors, there’s a problem. There were also some very strange side effects (such as the ability to cast something like Fear while ducking in and out of line of sight).<br />
<br />
Now, as I mentioned, the ability to always cast on the move wasn’t intended as a core Warlock feature (otherwise, it wouldn’t have been a talent). However, that doesn’t mean we want Warlock DPS to plummet every time there’s a fire on the ground. One thing that may have gone under the radar is the fact that the new version of KJC is not on the global cooldown, and can be cast while another cast is already in process. So, for example, you won’t have to interrupt a Chaos Bolt to activate KJC should you need to react to something in a hurry. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, it’s a change that we’re certainly going to balance around. Remember, we’re very early in what is likely to be a lengthy PTR cycle. There’s plenty of time to tweak and tinker with it. In fact, a recent change made internally allows Haunt to be cast while moving by default. The goal is most certainly not that Warlocks lose out on a ton of DPS or lose viability in raid encounters. We do encourage you to hop on the PTR, experiment with it, and tell us what think once you’ve gotten some hands-on time!<br />
<br />
I dont know if this is an issue with implementation on the PTR or bad information, I tried the new KJC on the ptr and it was on the GCD and it did interrupt a current spell cast.<br />
If it's acting that way on the PTR currently, it's just an outdated implementation of the spell. Again, we're very early in the PTR cycle. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/262621-consolidated-kjc-feedback-thread-pt-3/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9282218881?page=12#235))<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4 PTR Class Changes<br />
&quot;Moonkin Form no longer reduces all damage taken by 15%&quot;<br />
This is huge nerf for PvP... You need to compensate or something. Else I'm doomed to play arenas on alts again <br />
We removed these because they were causing a lot of problems in PvE situations. Don't fret though as we intend to balance around this change as we can adjust the damage in PvP to compensate for this in many different ways, such as resilience. <br />
<br />
To those wondering why Aspect of the Iron Hawk was only reduced in damage reduction rather than removed, this is because it's a talent and it still needs to have a purpose. We are happy that this change will mean that the other talents in that tier will be more attractive now.<br />
<br />
In general I think that gamebreaking effects, such as the Warrior one, do not fit into PvP. Even if the chance of proccing is only &lt;1%, it still feels out of place. I think we would get the &quot;5.1 TBF&quot;-situation <br />
The goal is for PvE set bonuses to not be the best choice possible, but not for them to be worthless either. We don't want PvE-focused players to be afraid to set foot in PvP by deactivating these cool set bonuses in PvP. If a PvE set bonus proves problematic though, we'll adjust it accordingly.<br />
<br />
What i do not understand though is why now add it all in a certain rating and not giving em gradually like tbc? As you also said there are no rewards for those below the said ratings which is quite high for many so there is no &quot;within reach&quot; goal that will push certain mindset of ppl to try a lil harder every time <br />
This follows the same logic as that of the Challenge mode armor rewards. Since they're a purely cosmetic reward, it doesn't make much sense to reward items one at a time because having several different items of varying colors would look out of place.<br />
<br />
This is overpowered. You'll have to be lower it to 20 - 30% off the CDs. Bubble with 2.5 minute CD and divine protection with 30 seconds is stupid. Can't let it go through or you'll have so much complains on these forums. <br />
The reason that this change is occurring is because we felt that Unbreakable Spirit was weak compared to its counterparts. We’ll be keeping a close eye on it, so be sure to test it out on the PTR when it becomes available.<br />
<br />
Now that we have a blue in here, whats the idea of making destru, one of the only speccs that has to cast to do damage, lose the only way to get it off? When you were versing 2 melees or hunter - melee as it is, getting casts off wasnt something easy to do, and now with nerfed mobility, how are you ever going to get a chaos bolt off to contribute to a kill? <br />
The reason for this change is that Kil'Jaeden's Cunning just felt too good and over 99% of Affliction Warlocks were taking it. We weren't happy with the snare effect, but when it had a cast time debuff instead, no one used it. Changing it to just be a snare effect ended up making the talent too good. We have a long PTR cycle ahead, there is plenty of time to tinker with it, and Warlocks will be balanced around this. <br />
<br />
It’s worth noting that the new Kil'Jaeden's Cunning is off of the global cooldown and can be cast while another spell cast is already in progress. For the Affliction Warlocks worried about this change; one recent change on the 5.4 PTR is that Haunt is now castable while moving.<br />
<br />
why rather not worry about the fact that 80% of the arena team above a certain rating are hunter-oriented? And there are changes coming for Hunters as well as the recent hotfixes that stopped pets summoned by Stampede using abilities and giving Blink Strikes a 20 second cooldown. Don't forget also:<br />
<br />
We have a long PTR cycle ahead, there is plenty of time to tinker with it <br />
There will be more changes to come, so keep your eyes on the patch notes blog and test out the changes when the 5.4 PTR comes around. Don't take all of these changes as the final ones, there are more to come and those that we have made can change as well. As Ghostcrawler said; &quot;The PTR is our Petri dish and not every experiment works&quot;.

Tier Set Pieces<br />
We currently do not have any plans to remove tier sets from LFR. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/262625-please-do-not-remove-set-pieces-from-lfr/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9281618854?page=1#10))<br />
<br />
Stromgarde Scenario<br />
Just to avoid any further confusion, there is no Stromgarde scenario (http://ptr.wowdb.com/zones/6760-stromgarde-keep) in patch 5.4, and what you’ve seen datamined is little more than a developer experiment with a stand-in name.<br />
<br />
This happens quite often; developers will put something quick together to test out some new tech or functionality, and the remnants occasionally slip through to the PTR files where dataminers can get ahold of them. <br />
<br />
So, just to be clear, there is currently nothing related to Stromgarde in production. That’s not to say it’s a location we’ll never revisit, but should that happen, it will not be in 5.4, and the recently datamined files will not be part of it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/262611-stromgarde-scenario-54/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9281758454?page=15#290))<br />
<br />
Golden Lotus Daily Quests<br />
The world does and will change from time to time and this change is no exception. You'll still have a variety of ways to get Golden Lotus rep, but yeah things won't be the same in the Vale. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/262589-golden-lotus-daily-quests/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9280508586?page=1#5))<br />
<br />
Legendary Quest Catch-up<br />
There is no way for the gap to ever be closed as by the time they get the gem - patch 5.4 is out. <br />
By the time they get cloak(which they will have to do old LFR for) everyone will get what i assume is an op weapon and the content will prolly be complete... <br />
<br />
When Patch 5.4 is released, the legendary quest items from 5.0/5.1 will drop in Throne of Thunders for players that are on that step of the questline. The developers don't see much value in keeping Tier 14 relevant once Tier 16 is available.<br />
<br />
However, in 5.4, if you decide to run Tier 14 raids for those items, you will see a dramatically increased drop chance. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/262587-legendary-chain-items-catchup10m/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7645875183?page=1#7))<br />
<br />
Flexible Raid System Clarifications<br />
Will the lockout be similar to LFR where you can run it again (with only 1 chance per week for loot) or will it be like normal, where you can only kill a boss once per week?<br />
Right now, the idea is to have FR lockouts work very similarly to lockouts in LFR.<br />
<br />
You will be able to repeat bosses, and that will actually still be somewhat rewarding, you’ll be able to use additional bonus rolls, earn Valor Points, and potentially loot some shinnies from trash...<br />
<br />
There’s something unique about FRs though, I’ll explain it with an example:<br />
Let's say you join a 12man and kill the first boss, leave the raid, and join a 20man, you might have to repeat the first boss. <br />
<br />
&quot;Might&quot;, so how does that work?<br />
If everyone in the new 20man raid has already killed the first boss just like you did, then that boss will not spawn.<br />
But even if only 1 of the players in that 20man has not killed the first boss, he will spawn again and everyone else will have to repeat the encounter.

They specifically said NEW 20 man. When you enter a new raid with a new ID, you might have to do bosses again. When you add people to your own, already existing, id, you will obviously not reset that raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, there's always next expansion. I'm sure they'll come up with one when game plot warrants it (for example, a reunion of the Warcraft I heroes).<br />
<br />
And the ilvl concerns are warranted, to be honest. Ever since the end of WotLK the item scaling has been a bit... crazy. It appears like it's some sort of design decision that wound up not being good years down the road that is particularly hard to back out of.... unless it's some sort of strange way to imply that our characters are becoming demigods in order to be strong enough to take on a fallen diety. <br />
<br />
Just because it's a difficult problem to resolve doesn't mean it shouldn't be brought up. And especially because of its difficulty, it shouldn't be ignored. It's been touched upon by Ghostcrawler about the possible technical problems regarding server-side calculations if the gear strength trend keeps on the way it has been for 5 years.<br />
<br />
<br />
That Proto-Drake named Galakras (Zaelas Mount) seems related to Galakrond x_O<br />
<br />
Galakrond was a protodrake (and the most powerful one there ever was, being the prognetor/parent of the Aspects), if that was what you were wondering.</div></div><hr />

It already has a staggered release compared to normals, if you feel that you NEED to do Flex just to progress through normals at an average rate then that is entirely your choice to do so.

Mostly because of the Change to Mannoroth's Fury too. So now 2/3rd's of our talent choices are 15 sec duration with 90 second cd's, not to mention both felt BETTER as passives. Everyone elses lvl 90 talents that have CD's at least DO something. It's like oh Warlocks now practically have Spiritwalker's Grace, and some...random ass AoE boost if they want it. I really hope they change it so Destro at least can keep it as a passive. Without that talent they are gutted because of long cast times.</div></div><hr />

If you are a person who progresses through normals at an average rate now, you certainly won't need to do Flex in order to do the same in 5.4<br />
<br />
Not that staggered according to Blizzard... it'll be probably one week later (while LFR will take more time).<br />
<br />
As Blizzard love to say to pvp players: &quot;pve isn't that generous&quot;. One week (hell, even a month) won't mean you'll be totally decked in new gear, so everything other than the next dificult is 0 upgrade.<br />

They specifically said NEW 20 man. When you enter a new raid with a new ID, you might have to do bosses again. When you add people to your own, already existing, id, you will obviously not reset that raid.<br />
<br />
I think only you got that way. I get the same idea, one guy that didn't kill, the boss is back for everyone.<br />
<br />
It's not about &quot;new 20 man&quot; or different raid size. Since it kinda of clearly shows that if you did the boss with 10 players, later join a &quot;new&quot; raid with 20, but if all those 20 players did the same bosses as you did that week, all 20 players would start on the next one. No respawn of older bosses.</div></div><hr />

Ever since the end of WotLK the item scaling has been a bit... crazy. It appears like it's some sort of design decision that wound up not being good years down the road that is particularly hard to back out of....<br />
<br />
No, it's not warranted, nothing stops you from doing old encounters with intended iLvl.<br />
<br />
High iLvl is just a way for players to get old gear that didn't drop. Or do you think people will for example form 40 man AQ raids today simply because a few people might want the 2H or a BattlePet that drops? Maybe you are whining cuz phoenix mount hasn't dropped for you? Well, I don't have it either, but you don't see me complaining. In the end, it's just numbers and a chance to revisit old content that otherwise would have been ignored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya know, for what it's worth there doesn't need to be a squish. What they need to do is just smaller number steps. SO the fuck WHAT if the next raid tier's gear is only 5 numbers above the last one? IT'S STILL HIGHER, IS IT NOT?! <br />
<br />
IDK why people freak out about useless numbers like that. I honestly miss the days before ilvl even became a thing that was implemented into the game. It's just another way for the elitists to be elitists...</div></div><hr />

Hunters are in a very, very good state right now, especially Beast Mastery. I find it hilarious that they think they're getting gutted or even somewhat in a bad place at all. <br />
<br />
Even after these minor nerfs, Hunters will still be incredibly strong in Arena and PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't PVP so I only care that all the crying from other PVP classes results in nerfs for my PVE hunter. I'm thinking it's time to put Stampede on the shelf in my rotation. According to blizz Stampede is the stable of 5 pets, each doing 25% of their damage. So this amounts to my pet plus 25%. With them only being able to auto-attack it means I'm without the special ability of the pet I'm using outside Stampede. It can be used only once in a boss fight unless the encounter goes on long enough for a second use. It is rather underwhelming.</div></div><hr />

If everyone in the new 20man raid has already killed the first boss just like you did, then that boss will not spawn.<br />
But even if only 1 of the players in that 20man has not killed the first boss, he will spawn again and everyone else will have to repeat the encounter.&quot;<br />
