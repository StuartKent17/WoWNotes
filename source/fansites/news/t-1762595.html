The Token will cost 20 Euro to purchase and the initial price is 35,000 gold. The current US price is ~22.5k.<br />
The WoW Token will be going live in the Europe game region on April 21 at approximately 5 p.m. CEST. The WoW Token will be available for 20 EUR (15 GBP) from the in-game Shop, and will be set at a starting price of 35,000 gold in the Auction House across the Europe region. From that point forward, the gold price will automatically fluctuate based on player supply and demand. To start we’ll be limiting the number of Token purchases from the Shop to 10 within a 30-day period, and the limit on Tokens purchased for gold will be set higher—though keep in mind these limits may be adjusted over time. While Tokens will be available immediately from the Shop, please note that there may be a delay before Tokens put up for sale on the Auction House become available for purchase with gold.<br />
<br />
Using WoW Token Game Time with a Recurring Subscription<br />
You can redeem WoW Tokens while you have an active recurring subscription—there’s no need to suspend your subscription or resubscribe. Your recurring subscription will automatically pause when your currently paid-for subscription period ends (e.g. for monthly subscribers, at the end of your current 30-day period), and all redeemed WoW Token game time will be applied next. Note that you can have multiple WoW Tokens redeemed on your account at any given time. Once any accumulated WoW Token game time expires, your recurring subscription will automatically pick up where it left off.<br />
<br />
Region-wide Exchange<br />
As discussed in our original announcement, each game region (Americas, Europe, Korea, Taiwan, and China) will have its own shared WoW Token exchange.<br />
<br />
Once purchased, a Token can then be put up for sale in a region-wide exchange via a new Game Time tab in the Auction House. While the rest of the Auction House will remain realm-based, a region-wide WoW Token exchange will provide the largest possible pool of prospective buyers and ensures everyone has access to a vibrant, active Token marketplace. In the Americas, Europe, Korea, and Taiwan, players who purchase a WoW Token from the Auction House will be able to redeem it for 30 days of game time.<br />
<br />
Going for Gold<br />
Because the Token exchange has to start somewhere, we will be setting the initial gold value of the WoW Token ourselves. The starting gold value in each region will be based on several factors, including regional in-game economies, but ultimately our goal is to select a fair and reasonable starting price. After that, the Token’s gold value will be determined dynamically based primarily on player supply and demand. Simply put, if more WoW Tokens are being listed than are being purchased, the price will automatically drift downward over time. If people are purchasing Tokens from the Auction House faster than they’re being put up for sale, then prices will go up accordingly. As a reminder, to help make sure players can trade WoW Tokens confidently, once a Token sells, the seller will receive the amount of gold they were quoted at the time they listed their Token.</div></div><hr />

You will have to reactivate the account with IRL money before you can go ingame to buy a token, since you actually need to be ingame to spend gold on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. When you log in to the character select screen there will be an option to purchase and use a WoW token. If you have enough gold, it will then extract that gold evenly from your characters.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure this is incorrect. When it launched in the US you were able to go on a frozen account and buy a token from the character select screen.</div></div><hr />

Certainly, there is no such thing as frozen account anymore. If you have an account without gametime it will automatically convert into a starter edition account, you can still login just won't have access to certain things until you put gametime on it.</div></div><hr />

You guys are special damn snowflakes and have special damn snowflake prices for subscriptions, but not for tokens? The world is ending, clearly, when you can't pay 6 EUR, so half of what the DAMN EUROPEAN UNION, which Russia is not a part of, is paying.<br />
Just be happy you have your own realms, for now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Conversion rates are a really bad way to judge things by though. <br />
Purchasing power is totally different from simple conversion rates.<br />
<br />
20 euros changes to 700 Thai Baht. So blizzard sell these &quot;hypothetical&quot; Thai WoW tokens for 700 Baht by exchange rate.<br />
But for the average Thai income, that 700 Baht is more like 100-150 euros when you compare it to monthly income and purchasing power.<br />
<br />
Of course this is a more extreme example, but it's just to prove a point.<br />
Main reason the EU prices are relatively so much higher than US prices are the taxes though. There is like 15% taxes for &quot;exporting goods&quot; to Europe.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
Anyway; I expect the prices to drop down to 25k pretty fast. I might jump on the bandwagon and try to sell a few tokens while the prices are still high.<br />
20 euros for 20-25k is not worth it in my yes. But 35k/€20 is a pretty interesting price.</div></div><hr />

Yes.<br />
<br />
EU Prices are legally required to always be listed WITH taxes. No such restriction exists in the US, and therefore they are basically always listed WITHOUT taxes. Online stores in particular do this, since they also cannot always know which state's tax rate to go with.<br />
<br />
It means for example that if something says &quot;4.99&quot; in the US, what you actually need to pay is 5.37 - or something equally annoying. It makes cash payments a PITA when traveling to the US. By contrast, in Europe, you'd just pay 4.99. So I can give them a fiver and leave.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the tokens are too scam sensitive. Especially in Russia (no offense).<br />
EVE Online has a long history of money laundering and fraud, especially in Russia.</div></div><hr />

I dont know why but im pretty sure things here will be different, as in the supply will not be higher than the demand, like on the US side. So imo it will probably get higher for a longer period of time untill it drops.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Give it about 5 minutes or so after servers come back up, you'll have the option to resub with gold from the character select screen. Be sure to be on the realm where you have the amount of gold to buy it with. It may take about 10 minutes or so depending on how fast people put them up in the AH. It took me around 20 minutes to finally complete the transaction as the token was always being &quot;bought out from under me&quot;. When complete, it'll take a portion of gold from each toon you log in on that server to cover the cost. The amount varies though. Like my monk it took about 600g from her, but my paladin, it took 9k gold from her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
let's just say 20% VAT as a base, so it is really ~ 16.67 pre-VAT euro vs $20 if you want to compare the raw price Blizzard actually receives. After figuring in exchange rates, prices are very similar...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Comparing starting values of 20$/30k G and 20EUR/35k G at an exchange rate of 1$=0.9290EUR, you will discover that the price of gold is in fact 8.3% lower in the EU, the only catch being that you are buying it in larger units.<br />
<br />
As far as Blizzard is concerned, anything happening after the start date is the result of supply and demand and they are in fact NOT screwing the EU because &quot;20 dollars = 20 euro&quot;.<br />

<br />
In case you missed it, if you have an inactive account:<br />
<br />
1. You can still log in and play any toon level 20 or lower with most of the restrictions that a trial account has.<br />
2. You can buy a token if the combined amount of gold on all your characters is as least as much as the going rate.<br />
3. If you buy a token, gold will be taken out evenly from all your toons. E.g. 20% of gold on each character.<br />
4. If you have previously bought a token from the AH, but didn't use it. You can use it even if it is on a toon higher than level 20.<br />
5. You can continue to use your low level characters without using a token, allowing you to save it for later.<br />
<br />
Also, if you have a recurring subscription using a token will delay your next and all future scheduled payments by 1 month.</div></div><hr />

That is shocking on many levels. If they were to 'buy their OWN products' as you say - where does the money go? <br />

<br />
Yes, I think that Blizzard decided at some point that it is better to buy listed tokens for &quot;printed&quot; gold (gold that they just create by click on a button) then to have token gold price driven to the ground by low demand, and ruin this whole idea in the start. So I am pretty sure that they are buying off tokens at 20k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To clarify more.<br />
Lapsed accounts will still be able to log in, only with restrictions similar in many ways to a starter account.<br />
Characters greater than level 20 being unable to be used etc.<br />
There will be an option on the character screen to buy a token at the going rate and taking gold &quot;equally&quot; from all your characters.<br />
Quite how the gold taken is distributed I do not know, but it doesn't require it to be on a single character.<br />
<br />
I will buy one token at that price, due to having 4 days left on my current game time.<br />
Though I was hoping for a lower price nearer that of the US token.<br />
Time will tell though as how that changes over time.<br />
I shall be watching that carefully.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im paying £8.99 (im still on the old price) and they want £15 for this seems about £2 pounds more expensive then it should be.<br />
<br />
No, you aren't buying game time.<br />
You buy that via the normal means for yourself.<br />
You are buying the stated quantity of gold, as the game time is only a mean to generate a sustainable demand that the cash to gold pet could not.<br />
The pet or anything freely tradeable in-game is sold as what it is.<br />
This isn't as there is no negotiation between the two parties on what they feel it is worth.</div></div><hr />

How does that work? It detects token like gold and you get extra option near $ and gold on character screen?<br />
<br />
Also does gold on unopened mail count? For example mailing from one account to another.</div></div><hr />

Unless the rules differ from US, then no, you can not use the mailbox on an account that's lapsed, as it's considered a &quot;starter account&quot;. It will tell you &quot;Trial accounts do not have access to this feature.&quot; I know, I was pissed when I couldn't access my mail on a toon I created to talk with the guild while I waited for a way to reactivate my account.

There are many aspects in the Europe region which can have a huge impact on the price while being practicaly inexistant in the Us region. I believe that buying power of many countries belonging to the EU region is so weak that demand will be much higher then in the US.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just remember that US region is not only north america and australia but also south america which is as poor (if not poorer) as east EU. Also for many east countries 10 euro (60 day prepaid = 20 euro) is not that much, it is less than two tickets to cinema or x3 fastfood. For real poor countries (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Independent_States) they have subs at half of price. Besides to make money you need to play, to play you needed to pay. Now think about it - if sub would cost 50 euro / month (to feel like you would live in CIS countries) would you pay it or rather find another game to play?</div></div><hr />

If you buy a token out of the AH in-game, it gets mailed to you. If you use the character select screen to purchase it to reactivate your sub, it takes away gold from all your toons on that server to cover the cost and not mailed to you, used immediately.<br />
<br />
Nevermind, I think I understand now. For some reason when you made that post it made it seem like you were going to log-in and use the AH on an under level 20 character to buy a token. You don't need to have all your money lumped on one toon, though!</div></div><hr />

It was rate-limited the entire time. It started at 1%/hour and then changed to 1%/15min for a while, before going back to 1%/hour -- presumably this was also part of the algorithm, letting the price adjust faster when there was an extreme discrepancy between available tokens and demand.<br />
<br />
The timing on it being 1%/15 minutes did also neatly coincide with the rough time-frame on credit cards checking out (and tokens starting to sell), for people who didn't have a card already attached to their accounts. That supports the idea that an extreme discrepancy (which would be very rare in normal use) triggers the algorithm over to rapidly (well, 'rapidly') adjusting for a time.</div></div><hr />

The US token costs 20$, which is about 18 euro. It's logical that the european token also has an increased starting price in gold to match the slightly higher price in real money. Logic is hard, yo.</div></div><hr />

Considering the starting price for US was 30k I don't see how 35k is double 30k but whatever.... <br />
<br />

Also considering the US token crashed hard on launch, it could possibly happen to the european one as well. Then it's only a matter how what is 35k worth to you ? I know that I have around 300k on my toon at the moment, haven't played in a while, and will most likely buy a token or two.

In the eyes of the law, when you buy tokens (as a way to acquire gold) for real money, blizzard is obliged to deliver you the product that you bought (gold) in expected amount, and in a timely manner. If it ever comes to that stage, Judiciary wont examine how blizzard does that, if they did it through middle man (people that buy your tokens on ah for gold that gets transferred to you) or they directly bought your token for the gold they created for that occasion.<br />
<br />
So if you buy token for real money and you are not able to sell it in a reasonable time period, to get promised gold (because there is not enough demand) you could sue blizzard. To counter that, blizzard is buying off your tokens, in order to deliver you promised product (gold). That is why you are not seeing that times to sell tokens go above 12 hours, or gold value bellow 21k.<br />
<br />
So i believe that Blizzard created script that is buying tokens when their value gets close to 21k and when they are listed on the ah for a long time period. Cyclical price change also suggests this, because in real market there is no way that price change would be so predictable.<br />
<br />
Now the question is, at which price Blizzard will decide to defend token price in EU market, I beleve that they will be bolder now, that thay will start to buy off tokens at higher price, to create more demand, to earn more from people who buy tokens of real money. I expect token price around 27k.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you can store up to 10 tokens on an account, and then use them later even if your account is inactive.</div></div><hr />

1100 RUB for token, when subscription is 359 RUB/month<br />
<br />
You buy the token with excess gold not RUB. If a month of time is not worth 35k gold to you so be it. The people spending RUB would be buying gold.</div></div><hr />

It should. The token will count as a month of gametime. That someone else essentially bought the gametime and traded it to you for some ingame gold should not make a difference for the criteria of adding a month of subscriptiontime to give the mount.<br />
<br />
However you still need to first buy the base set to make it an active account first. You can't send mail or trade with a trial account, plus they can only get a limited amount of gold in the first place.<br />
Still, it saves a month of subscription for the mount if you do buy the base set for the second account.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't played on your account for a while and you don't have WoD yet, why not just use the 10 day trial? That way you can withdraw money from your guild bank and you get 10 days extra. <br />

<br />
It's $15 a month and $20 for a token in the US. So it's exactly the same difference as it is in the states. And for the billionth fucking time You're not buying the token with money for a sub, you're buying it for gold that's why the token is more expensive than a sub £15 is also $22.31. So it's actually ever so slightly better value for money, considering that starting price on gold is more.</div></div><hr />

No, the amount doesn't matter. It could be 10 euro for 17.6k or 1000 euro for 1760k, the exchange rate is just soooo low. It's not that 100 euro is a lot (not to me, anyway), it's that 176k is ridiculously little in game. A mount in the store costs 25 euro, the Alliance Chopper mount is now 56,80 euro in comparison...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is. Imagine the price being at 30k gold. People put their tokens on the AH but no one is going to buy it for those 30k so the price will slowly drops to let's say 20k. Now bunch of people will buy those tokes for 20k but sellers will still get their 30k as promissed. This is how it is working. People sell tokens for high price and buy for low price. That's why the graph is so sawtoothy.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's going to balance out at 60k. This isn't US, people are generally a lot more poor in Europe so the value of free game time is a lot higher than in the US.<br />

It's not about poverty. US region has it's own share of poor countries. It's more about different mentality of EU people towards this system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah and now think about the graph. The price is rising, too. In this situation the people get LESS gold than the buyer paid for the token. And i bet that the extra and the less gold will balance out in the end.<br />

You forget about other side of this process. People will put their tokens at 20k gold, the price will go up, say to 25k, but they will still get only 20k, 5k gold will be consumed by Blizzard. So Blizzard here acts like a bank with initial Capital. Sure some gold will be generated or removed (!) from the game (depending on the final stabilized price of token) in the process of forming the final price.</div></div><hr />

Yep. People don't look at the economic differences. The minimum wage in the US is what, $7/hour? Well for some EU countries the minimum wage is about $225/month if not less; that comes to around 5-6 times less than the US. <br />
<br />
The demand for tokens will be a lot higher in the EU and the supply will probably not keep up.</div></div><hr />

This is not possible to happen. Price can go up only when there is not enough tokens available. It is simply impossible for the token to go up to 25k from 20k. In fact the price would go down if there is token available on AH for that long.</div></div><hr />

And since the price is still going up consistently, I'd expect most seller are waiting for the prices to go higher.<br />
<br />
Inversely, buyers are buying more than usual since 1) it was just released and 2) theres a panic it'll get more expensive.<br />
<br />
Its a nasty feedback loop that likely won't settle under morning. Note that theres a dramatic difference in the US in how long tokens take to sell depending on when you check. From less than 30m to 12 or above hours. The decline in price starts after midnight.</div></div><hr />

the only speculating ones atm are blizzard - few people which bought tokens for cash reporting tokens being sold within first 2 minuts of it being put on auction - way to fast imo for it to be natural sell speed at this price.<br />

Yes, it &quot;appears&quot; to have finally hit a peak which is good for players such as me planning to buy for gold but were too slow to catch it early.<br />
It makes sense that such a rise could not be sustained indefinitely, but was almost certainly fuelled by a number of factors,<br />
Not least the significant delay before the EU release which gave players time to earn more gold and so will bump up how much some are willing to spend on them.</div></div><hr />

So prices is likely to raise again during the day, unless people freakout and start selling as many tokens as possible now, making supply higher than demand. But if the trend from last night continues, we might see the tokens passing 55-60k by tonight. Which is when I believe most people will be attempting to sell. (And should, cause 40-60k is a lot better price for the seller than at goldsellers).<br />
<br />
I don't think people selling tokens for gold at looking at it from a goldsellers perspective.<br />
<br />
I just think Europe value IRL money higher than US does.<br />
<br />
Because at 20k gold for one month sub, I'd be all over it, but 45k and up is just too steep.<br />
<br />
Another thing is that my understanding of the token prices reflects the mentality of EU versus US in regards to &quot;P2Winning&quot; (brackets because, buying tokens for gold would allow you to buy BOE, but won't make you a pro-player).<br />
<br />
I don't think EU players dump cash on BOEs just to get an edge when a couple of LFRs could get you the same stuff.<br />
<br />
Plus the fact that gold is meaningless in ridiculous quantities. What is it good for ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't matter how your gold is split. When you buy a token, gold is subtracted from all the characters on your account proportionally.</div></div><hr />

You are right that it doesnt make you a pro player, but on Kazzak EU for example you can purchase a full 10/10 heroic BRF run with all MS gear that drops for only 150k which is slighly more than 60€ atm. You get nice gear, achievements (so that you can start pugging or join a raiding guild), get to experience the content how its meant to be. For me this is a way of winning. And of course at the end of the expansion the same thing is going to happen with mythic mode and challenge modes, so those who say pay2win might be somewhat right even if its not direct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or it will acts like in the US - peak was 45k which is 13k (!) more than in US means price will settle at around 35k (in US it is avg of 22k).</div></div><hr />

In Europe less people have a credit card (we pay everything with the debit-card) and because of this blizzard always have a waiting time when you put in into the auction house. (i think with a credit card it goes instantly). So nearly all tokens were in the queue so the supply was low. Now the supply got higher and the price is sinking.</div></div><hr />

IMHO pay2win implies forking out real cash for something ingame.<br />
<br />
Buying runs / loots with IN GAME gold might be &quot;buying your way&quot; in content that you wouldn't otherwise see but it's not as bad as giving real money for some pixels.<br />
<br />
Buying runs has always been a thing<br />
<br />
The only thing is before the token, someone would have paid the 150k gold (which could take a while to farm), now (based on current rate) he could spend aprox 60€ and p2w with &quot;no effort&quot;.<br />
<br />
The definition of P2W varies greatly depending on the game. AFAIK you can't &quot;buy&quot; your way to victory in WoW. Having 10/10MM and full max lvl items doesn't make you anybetter than the guy who &quot;worked&quot; through the content. It wont help you win arena games either.<br />
<br />
Loot &gt; skill to some extent in WoW, but in a pvp environement where everyone has the same stuff (give or take a few) loot means nothing.</div></div><hr />

An inactive account now counts as a starter edition (meaning you can only play to level 20. characters above 20 cannot be logged in on).<br />
You will be able to buy a Token from the Character Select screen if you have enough money and that will re-active your account.</div></div><hr />

The system is a wee bit buggy when you buy from character select it seems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Despite EU people having less money than US people, the sub cost is higher since Wow is not premium entertainment. You can get a lot of value of your cash if you play WoW a lot, compared to a lot of middle upper class US people who spend a lot of money on vacations, and other consumables.</div></div><hr />

Don't know how employers are in regards to paying overtime, but I know that in France working overtime is rarely paid :)</div></div><hr />

In Canada, everything above 37.5h is paid 1.5x, well at least in Québec. 2x if it's a holiday.</div></div><hr />
