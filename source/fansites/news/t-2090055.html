BlizzCon 2016 Early Access Sale<br />
It’s time to gear up for BlizzCon® 2016—this year’s BlizzCon online merchandise sale has begun! From now until November 6, BlizzCon attendees and Virtual Ticket holders get early access to a wealth of BlizzCon-premiere loot through the Blizzard Gear Store (http://blizz.ly/2dRXcTk).<br />
<br />
The store is packed with new items debuting at the show, and there are plenty of BlizzCon classics as well. Visit the BlizzCon section of the Gear Store (gear.blizzard.com/blizzcon (http://blizz.ly/2dRXcTk)) to check out what our tailors, blacksmiths, and engineers have concocted to celebrate Blizzard’s 25th anniversary. <br />
<br />

<br />
The Merchy Pin will be given out as a gift to anyone making a purchase over $100 (before shipping and taxes) from the Gear Store.<br />
<br />
To access the BlizzCon sale, simply head to the Blizzard Gear Store (gear.blizzard.com (http://gear.blizzard.com/)), and log in using the Battle.net account you used to purchase your Virtual Ticket (http://blizz.ly/2dMlQIf). Each of this year’s BlizzCon-premiere products will be marked with a BlizzCon logo.<br />
<br />
If you’re attending BlizzCon in person, use the same account you used to redeem the BlizzCon Digital Bonuses code that was sent to you via email earlier this year. If a friend bought your ticket for you, ask them for your code—remember, it also grants you a Virtual Ticket and this year’s in-game goodies—and head to www.battle.net/code (http://blizz.ly/2dMjw45) to redeem it.<br />
<br />
Supplies for the BlizzCon goodies are limited, so if you spot anything you like, make sure to act fast. All orders will be shipped upon receipt—so the sooner you order, the faster you’ll get your BlizzCon swag. Keep in mind that orders are shipped from the United States, so international shipping rates and some limitations may apply. We’ll also be adding new premiere items once BlizzCon gets underway on November 3, so be sure to check back in then.<br />
<br />

Artifact Weapon Quests<br />
You won't be able to start a new Artifact quest chain off until you finish the one you most recently started. So you'll need to head back to the point you were on with your Balance quest chain and continue from there. These quest chains aren't too long so it shouldn't take too much time, plus there's an achievement to be had for obtaining all the Artifacts for your class.<br />
<br />
Once you've obtained the Balance Artifact and finished the chain, you'll then be able to choose another Artifact weapon to pursue. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/774518-cant-pick-up-next-artifact-weapon-quest/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613692266?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Hardcore vs Casual<br />
I think it's easy to define people by their &quot;progression&quot;.<br />
<br />
Raids are a good example - I would never see someone as as &quot;casual&quot; player if they are investing into Mythic raids during progression periods (sans carry). Most of that is to do with the amount of playtime investment required, so you could also take that as a major factor. <br />
<br />
A hardcore player would also do as much as they can to maximize their playtime to the extreme, while a casual player would be fine enjoying the game within its constraints and limitations without pushing too hard.<br />
<br />
Either way, I think it's obvious that a majority of the player base would be defined as casual within this, no?<br />
<br />
I would substitute mythic raid for raid commitments on a schedule to be non-casual. Spending half of your non-raiding time figuring out flasks and other raid attributed stuff pushes you into hardcore. So it is almost like a 3rd label is missing. Casual -- Something else -- Hardcore.<br />
I agree with everything you said. Time commitment, set-up, and strategic planning pushes Hardcore.<br />
<br />
Something in between is an interesting thought as well, somewhere I'd probably fall at the moment. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/774404-hardcore-vs-casual/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749795836?page=4#69))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Hi Greg, in a scenario where players abused a bug to become the best in a multiplayer game (ex: insidia getting the world first kill on the lich king), do you think taking action ( temporary ban, claw back the rewards etc.) against these players is justified? It was the game team's fault after all. <br />
I understand your point, but I think that argument can be taken to extremes pretty easily. What if my raiding guild orchestrated a DDOS attack designed to knock out the servers right when a rival guild was about to get a kill? After all, the tech team should be able to handle the attack, right? Even if you're talking about a single raiding guild, is hacking the client okay? Is using a mod that provides info that is available but trivializes the fight okay? Is exploiting the boss pathfinding okay?<br />
<br />
These things are subjective, and the times I was invovled (like the LK one) we often had to make hard calls in the heat of the moment while watching those attempts. We tried to err on the side of what most players would find reasonable. Using an unusual talent build or having a warlock tank feel like clever problem-solving. Interacting with terrain geometry starts to get dicey. I would also hate to see devs stick to very simple fight designs just because having fewer moving parts would make it easier to feel secure about there being zero chance of a tech limitation. That collapsing platform in LK was a big part of the fight, but also pushing the engine to its limits. (Source (http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answers/140687314315))<br />

No, it's a vulnerability that exists if you put your game online. There really isn't any way to design an MMORPG to be immune to DDoS. The difference here is that one is the team fucking up and the other is criminal activity that has 0 to do with the code they put in the game.

So, you are saying no one should ever be faulted for doing something in a game that can be prevented? Well, I disagree there, I think ppl should be faulted for breaking the rules of the game, regardless if those rules can be enforced or not.</div></div><hr />

I was enchanter, I'd usually have Mats on me to enchant for people, if they got something new. The guild would filter unused items to me to DE, knowing I'd usually be able to enchant on the fly. There were a couple of people who were really, really consistent about &quot;hey, can you enchant this&quot; and would immediately log off to get mats from an alt.. when to me, that wasn't needed, i was helping my friends/guild. I wouldn't refuse the mats, cuz I never did any of it for profit. I was also a cook and fisher, so I'd have feasts and such. Many times, the only one with feasts. I think over time, changing raid members and people just leaving the game, i was less invested in the individuals, and that would change how i prepared. So in BC and start of Wrath, i would be 100% prepared for what was needed. By the end of wrath, and then fast forward to MOP... i wouldn't even use flasks or potions, sometimes not gemmed or enchanted.<br />
<br />
End of WoD, only my PVP main was enchanted. My other main PVPer had his gun scope always ready, but some of the other stuff wasn't always updated. He did have flasks and potions and those runes though, cuz I loved 2-3 shotting EVERYONE, sans AA. <br />
<br />
Even with BC 100% prepared, i wouldn't call myself hardcore.</div></div><hr />

Greg was referring to the outcome of both situations, not to the situations being equal - the outcome being that people should not break the rules, regardless of the rule being enforceable or not, and that we should fault those that break the rules, regardless if we are able to enforce the rules or not</div></div><hr />

Your epeen is showing. Its very clear from his comments that he understands that DDOS is the no-brainer edge case and where he sees the more relevant gray area (oddball tactics, geometry exploitation, pathing exploitation, etc.) Comp sci background or not doesn't come into this.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Items rewarded from emissary bags now more closely match the quality of World Quest rewards&quot; erm what?<br />
<br />
Never mind, found the details on wowhead:<br />
<br />
In the latest round of Blizzard hotfixes, items from Emissary rewards will now have an ilvl closer to those from World Quests. Emissary caches tended to have loot in the ilvl 805 range, which didn't feel rewarding after World Quest rewards were scaling up to ilvl 835 before Titanforged procs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has nothing to do with epeen and everything to do with Greg Street making ridiculous statements that are ridiculous. He literally goes from talking about bugs in the game to an opposing guild hacking to prevent their rivals getting progress... It's very clear you're reading a lot more into his comments than I am. I'm taking his words at their meaning as he had no character limitation on his post. To say it's even remotely in the same category as playing the game and cleverly using the mechanics as programmed is 100% ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Polystone is a plastic. The &quot;poly&quot; part in the name points to that, as it being a polymer with resin as it's base. It's a good material for making figurines, yes, but it's basically a plastic. And, I would bet that if Blizzard is stocking them, and they're not a short, numbered run, they are most likely being made in China.</div></div><hr />

as an owner of many many many polystone statues in no way would i consider them plastic, but i do see the point with poly in the name.. So not disagreeing just from the hey i know shit about polymers and stuff.. i wouldn't think plastic :) And also doubt they are numbered and sure they are made in China.. do big deal to me. iv'e been wanting one forever and i rarely play hearthstone. I can't wait to get mine in the mail :)</div></div><hr />

True I guess.. thermoplastic polyester-resin material with an alumina tri-hydrate (ATH) filler and a pigment</div></div><hr />
