Our raid item philosophy has evolved a lot since vanilla. The tier sets were once considered a badge of honor. Someone stalking around (or mailbox afking) with their full set bonus might as well have been sporting a legendary item. These days, we virtually guarantee that any player with an interest in raiding is going to be able to complete at least the lowest level version of their set with just a minimal level of persistence. This ultimately serves as a powerful reward mechanism and is in line with our philosophy of letting more players actually see the content.<br />
<br />
This design though also has its risks. One of the big ones is that item progression becomes very predictable and deterministic. Imagine (just as an example) a model where all bosses drop emblems and every item you want is for sale. That may sound cool for a few weeks, until you hit the point that without any kind of random element to progression that you can calculate to the day/week at which you will finish gearing up your character. The excitement of what the boss drops would be gone and we feel this would end up making the purpose of clearing new content very underwhelming.<br />
<br />
Trinkets are really the one item (weapons are to a lesser extent) that we use to try and capture that old slot machine feel from the classic Molten Core days. Yes, completely random loot with huge loot tables can be frustrating but we are pretty far from being completely random these days. Trinkets however are still somewhat random, they can be hard to acquire, and there is often a lot of competition for them.<br />
<br />
Trinkets are also tricky to design because we don’t want them to be just a pile of stats like other items. We generally want them to be unique by having a random proc or an on-use ability or something similar. These types of things are always trickier to balance, but this is also what makes them interesting. We also don’t necessarily want every trinket to be a guaranteed upgrade just because the item level is higher. Knowing what works or doesn’t work for your particular character and play style is one of the ways players have to demonstrate their mastery of the game.<br />
<br />
There are some aspects of trinkets for which we think we can do better. For example, it’s annoying when a superior item is on a lower tier of content to where you feel like you have to argue with your guild to go back and farm easy bosses or run a 10 player version when everyone else wants to do 25. Many of the trinkets probably represent too big a dps (or equivalent) jump given how difficult it can be to acquire them. It’s also easy for us to fall into a rut of offering basically the same one every time (often because we know players like it) rather than experimenting with different things. We like to try new things to keep gear interesting for players as we know some have been evaluating trinkets for over five years now.<br />
<br />
We also probably just need to drop more of them. That doesn’t mean they should be trivial to acquire, but when say a caster only has 2 good options in Ulduar and 1 requires a hard mode, then there is going to be ton of competition when they do drop. We know it’s rough when the trinket you have been wanting finally drops and you have to roll against 10 other people for it. Having more trinkets would mean more variety, which means players may want different ones and ultimately will be a little more different from their friends/guildmates. <br />
<br />
Talent Trees in Cataclysm<br />
I was going to bump this to the General forum, but I think the talent tree comment is worth addressing in the role forums, since it applies to class design.<br />
<br />
1) We are changing talent trees, in some cases substantially. The major focus is pruning out boring but valuable talents that passively increase say damage or healing.<br />
<br />
2) A secondary focus is to fix the clunky areas (e.g. warlocks having two conflicting range increasing talents). We're not going to remove old favorites or radically change the focus of the trees. You will definitely have to rethink your builds however.<br />
<br />
3) Because you earn passive bonuses just for spending points in the tree, those fun, niche or utility talents won't seem as expensive as they do today. We want to create a lot more choices where you are choosing utility vs. utility. We want to see far more &quot;cookie cutter&quot; build guides that say &quot;Spend the last 5-10 points where you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
4) In some cases, trees will flat out get new abilities. These are in addition to the new level 81+ abilities.<br />
<br />
5) You will get 5 additional talent points for the new levels.<br />
<br />
6) We are not deepening the trees. This actually unlocks some interesting opportunities. For the first time, you can reach a 51 point talent and a 21 point talent in another tree.<br />
<br />
I'll also add that for Lich King we just brought Naxxramas back and adjusted the bosses for 10 and 25 raid sizes. The Cataclysm raids are new content with new maps and new bosses. We're just trying to hit the nostalgia button with mentioning old foes like Ragnaros. Ragnaros may be back, but he's not in Molten Core. <br />

Invincible as a 25-man heroic mode reward only<br />
Blizzard loves 10-person content guilds just as much as we love 25-person content guilds. The reason for having this mount in the 25-person Lich King encounter has to do with maintaining the proper distribution of such awesomeness. If it were available in the 10-person encounter as well, it may become too prolific and lose some of its initial unique qualities. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22748799344-why-does-blizz-hate-10-man-guilds.html))<br />
<br />
10-Man / 25-Man tuning<br />
The 10-person heroic raid dungeons are tuned in such a way that players do not need to rely on gear from the 25-person normal mode equivalents. We made many adjustments along the way to make that possible. While it can be helpful to obtain additional gear from the 25-person normal modes, it's certainly not necessary and we were pleased to see so many players able to attempt and complete the 10-person heroic encounters in ToC who progressed exclusively from 10-person normal ToC. Often times players feel that they need to obtain items from higher content in order to complete Heroic encounters, when improved strategies would equally suffice.<br />
<br />
We will continue watching upcoming content in the future to make certain that we are able to adjust these encounters and keep them aligned with our goals. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22748799344-why-does-blizz-hate-10-man-guilds.html))<br />

Purified Lunar Dust item budget - Purified Lunar Dust (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50358/purified-lunar-dust/)<br />

Best DPS spec<br />
I think one of the most interesting aspects is to look at those classes where one spec is generally perceived to be &quot;the best.&quot;<br />
<br />
For rogues, locks and hunters there are some players who choose the &quot;second&quot; spec even at a presumed dps loss. For mages, nearly all go Arcane even though Fire's damage really isn't that bad. (What I mean is that I don't think you can argue Combat, Survival and Destruction all trump Fire to explain why there are more of those specs on this fight). In all four cases, the third spec is pretty dead. (We'll assume the Demo locks are mostly there for DP, which as I've said before is not ideal).

Death Knights and ranged abilities<br />
It really just comes down to our not wanting death knights to be a ranged class. It is a melee class. Now they have some great ranged tools and some ranged spells, not unlike say an Enhancement shaman who throws out the occasional Lightning Bolt. There's nothing wrong with that. It's only when the DK strategy shifts to favoring ranged attacks too much that we make adjustments. The DK that runs around and does nothing but Icy Touch or Howling Blast or Death Coil feels like a rogue who forgoes combo points and openers and everything just to spam Fan of Knives and nothing else. It would probably even be okay if Death Coil was the largest component of damage, so long as you had to use your melee attacks to set that up first. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22749569612-design-intentions-for-dks-in-arena.html))<br />
<br />
Death Knights tanking<br />
Your understanding in this case does not appear to mesh with reality. There are still plenty of DK tanks in Icecrown.<br />
<br />
The death knight was a new class with a lot of cool abilities, lore and a great starting experience. It doesn't surprise me at all that a lot of players flocked to them. When it turned out they were overpowered in dps, PvP and tanking early on in Lich King, that probably encouraged more players to pick them up or stick with them. So it's natural that after several patches the numbers have evened out a bit more, but there are still plenty of DKs and they seem to be doing just fine tanking Icecrown. We'll see if things look different when the hard modes unlock. If DKs (of appropriate gear and skill) struggle on those fights, we'll buff them.

Arcane vs Fire<br />
Is Arcane generally above Fire? Yes. The difference may only be 10% though, and Fire is still above many damage specs. Is Arcane so much higher than Fire than Marks is to Survival? Not really. Yet we see more Survival hunters (in this particular data set on one boss) than we do Fire mages. Clearly more is going on that players just gravitating towards whichever spec does the most damage. (The key word is &quot;just.&quot; Players definitely like specs that deliver the most damage, but that does not appear to be the sole governing concern in this case.)<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things contributing to Arcane beating other mages. Incanter's Absorption is probably way too good in conjunction with kind Disc priests. Arcane benefits a lot on movement fights like PP. Arcane benefits a lot from using those Innervates that the Fire mage can't really use and the healers (for the moment at least) don't really need. As Lhivera points out, Frost can do decent (not stellar) given the chance, but fights like Marrowgar really exploit (in a bad way) Frost's relative lack of pushback resistance.<br />
<br />
We'd like to get the mages closer together, and that's something we're still going to work on. (&quot;Wait until Cataclysm&quot; is something snarky players like to say more than we do.) What we don't want to do is suddenly catapult Frost up ahead of Arcane such that every mage feels like they have to change... again. Close, without going over, is kind of the mantra at this stage.

Tier 10 4-pieces Bonus<br />
There is a bug where the pet is not always receiving the damage bonus from the 4PT10 warlock set. We are going to fix it.<br />
<br />
The issue of having to recast Corruption in order to benefit from the proc is a much harder problem to solve. We might be able to do something, but we can't promise a good solution there. It is just the nature of the way rolling dots work. You gain the benefit of whatever crit you on when you cast the spell, but aren't going to gain the benefit from procs that occur later on. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22749238761-warlock-t10-4pc-bugged.html))<br />
<br />
Soul Shards in Cataclysm<br />
Ideally we design it so that you don't need a way to get them back in combat. We think that makes the shards feel more like cooldowns than something you do every time they are on cooldown. (Example: you generally save Heroism / Bloodlust for the best time to use it, not the first available time to use it.) It is definitely possible though that a lock could feel janked if they used their last shard just as a bunch of adds joined the fight or whatever. In that case we might have to add some kind of Evocation-like ability to get the shards back in emergencies.<br />
<br />
In a very pure, possibly unrealistic sense, though we'd love to see 3 shards per fight with some kind of cooldown in between the use of each. I mean non-trivial fights here. Maybe you use 1 shard on raid trash and no shards while killing a mob for a quest while leveling. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22749239951-soul-shards-in-cata.html))</div></div><hr />

It's more in the way of that if a 25 man HC guild gets invincible, they then send in, what, 2-3 10 man teams that will then clear it, and that's 3-4 Invincibles a week. It makes sense to just be 25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it doesn't. It's a mount, it's not supposed to be special. Shadowmourne, the most powerful weapon in-game right now, is obtained in 25-man Normal mode. They're giving the most powerful weapon to anyone that can kill a boss in normal mode 25-mans, yet a mount that does nothing? That's 25-man hard mode only!</div></div><hr />

I think you're right. At first, I read it as 5 per level but upon rereading, I'm pretty sure he means 5 more past 80.</div></div><hr />

I like that idea. Generally, people are getting chests/shoulders/helms/pants/gloves from badges/trophies/ect. Why have badly statted, non-set-bonus-giving pants drop again, when that slot would be much nicer to give a trinket, or another weapon drop. Fewer items dropped is fine.</div></div><hr />

Well, it seems like we never really &quot;kill&quot; any of the bigger bads, who're classified as &quot;Eternals&quot; on Wow Wiki, small bads like Vashj, Kael'thas, Kel'thuzad, even Illidan seem very killable, but bigger bads like Ragnaros, C'thun, Yogg-Saron, the Lich King (sort of?), and Kil'jaeden aren't &quot;completely dead&quot;, Kil'jaeden was just pushed back through the Sunwell, Ragnaros was just banished back to the Elemental Plane (probably losing all contact with Azeroth? Even if he didn't, it's not like all those fire elementals we destroyed to banish him in the first place will do him any good if he could have them attack us :P), C'thun's essence/soul/ghost/whatever is still very much around, even if we &quot;destroyed his body&quot;, people say we killed him, but then later in WOTLK it tells us if we kill Old Gods it'd be very bad for us, the player racers. &gt;&gt; I dunno.</div></div><hr />

Also, since Invincible was so close to Arthas, you'd think that he was pretty dang special to him so of course it should and will be a rare mount.

Invincible wouldn't just be handed away to anybody passing by. He was so close to Arthas and their bond was as if they shared a common soul. Something that meaningful is not a common thing to come by so of course the mount is going to be very rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's not Rag's story.<br />
<br />
Elementals have to be summoned to Azeroth because they exist on another plane of existence. When we kill an elemental they just go back to their plane of existence. Ragnaros, being an elemental lord, required a lot of effort to summon. The convinced the Dark Iron dwarves to summon him to Azeroth so he could take over. Whe nwe fought Ragnaros they were in the process of summoning him, similar to Kil'Jaeden. They summoned about 10% of Rag when we showed up. Deathwing destroys the barriers between the planes of existence, so Ragnaros can now walk freely between the 2 worlds, without having to be summoned, so he's at full power.</div></div><hr />

As of tier gear meaning something, I still believe vault bosses should ONLY drop tier 10 and not 10.5 in 25. 10 man should drop 9.75 if anything as rare few people downed Anub' to see the loot and it still has a value slightly above tier 10 but below 10.5.</div></div><hr />

Tbh fuck that, if you want 9.25/10.25 get god dam trophy's and marks off end of wing bosses, as to the 9.75 my same response, giving retards Anub HM 25 tier sounds great.

<br />
1) We are changing talent trees, in some cases substantially. The major focus is pruning out boring but valuable talents that passively increase say damage or healing.<br />
<br />
2) A secondary focus is to fix the clunky areas (e.g. warlocks having two conflicting range increasing talents). We're not going to remove old favorites or radically change the focus of the trees. You will definitely have to rethink your builds however.<br />
<br />
3) Because you earn passive bonuses just for spending points in the tree, those fun, niche or utility talents won't seem as expensive as they do today. We want to create a lot more choices where you are choosing utility vs. utility. We want to see far more &quot;cookie cutter&quot; build guides that say &quot;Spend the last 5-10 points where you want.&quot;<br />
<br />
4) In some cases, trees will flat out get new abilities. These are in addition to the new level 81+ abilities.<br />
<br />
5) You will get 5 additional talent points for the new levels.<br />
<br />
6) We are not deepening the trees. This actually unlocks some interesting opportunities. For the first time, you can reach a 51 point talent and a 21 point talent in another tree.<br />
<br />
I'll also add that for Lich King we just brought Naxxramas back and adjusted the bosses for 10 and 25 raid sizes. The Cataclysm raids are new content with new maps and new bosses. We're just trying to hit the nostalgia button with mentioning old foes like Ragnaros. Ragnaros may be back, but he's not in Molten Core.<br />

That was my first thought as well. Nothing about it being badly underbudget for it's ilevel either. I have a feeling they're just going to roll out the patch without addressing it at all.<br />
<br />
*edit* And I don't really get how these things slip by. This and the trinket that they're correcting. You'd imagine there has to be some sort of item creation utility they use, you'd think it would tell you if the stat weights were over/under for the item's ilevel.</div></div><hr />

Relax, you can always wait till Cataclysm comes out and someone does a much smaller run on 25-man ICC at Level 85. The key to 25 man raids is to ignore everything but what you are doing, the boss is doing and the raid leader is telling you what to do. Just tune out everything else.<br />
<br />
Also, a 51 point skill with a 21 point skill from a different talent tree in player talent builds offers new and interesting possible combinations.</div></div><hr />

I didn't forget it. It was covered in the blue post I was commenting on. Hence the 'Other reasons' as in, besides the higher dps of Arcane.<br />
<br />
Better threat reduction talent, much easier to reach hit cap, more interactive mana management, more cooldowns and better burst dps.<br />

Since the blue poster seemed to miss out some of the obvious reasons people play Arcane and include things like IA (which is nice, but... really? no-one plays Arcane speficially for IA) and more effective Innervates (...lol)</div></div><hr />

In the part about the mages he uses that to justifie that lot of players pick the specc they like over the most dps... He is wrong.<br />
<br />
SV was top dps for a long time, that's why a lot of players still trust in it.<br />
MM has the thing with armor penetration hanging over it. The forum are filled with posts saying 'when should I go MM?' meaning that a lot of players think that SV is top dps untill a certain gear level and than only MM take sover.<br />
The more it seems clear MM took over in general, the more hunters all round will specc MM.<br />
<br />
SV is still good yes, but MM is getting more and more popular as hunters see they don't need the best gear anymore to do better with MM.<br />
<br />
A few (like myself actually) still like SV because of playstyle and some nostalgia, but if GC thinks he can use this argument to justifie differences in specc, he is mistaken.<br />
<br />
The larger part of the hunter community has always specced whatever did highest dps (BM, than SV than MM, etc). <br />
They still do.<br />
Only 'difference' is the slow transition from SV to 'MM with high ArP' to 'MM in general actually'.<br />
Nothing to do with his fantasy (or excuse) of players picking the lower dps specc because of preference to the playstyle.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true. First of all, I think the post mentioned talent trees are getting redone, which means we could see new talents anyway in earlier trees. If they decide to remove the shared CD's between NS and EM, it could be pretty interesting. If nothing else, it let's us overload the ele tree and get things like Reverb. (Maybe enough to include a constant shock into the rotation?) We can also pick up more utility talents in enhance or go for NS and Tidal Mastery in resto (if NS gets redone).<br />
<br />
People are forgetting the point of the entire reasoning for this...Utility and fun. I'm so tired of being forced into using the exact same build as every other shaman. The idea of getting maybe 10 points to play with is very appealing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Elementals have to be summoned to Azeroth because they exist on another plane of existence. When we kill an elemental they just go back to their plane of existence. Ragnaros, being an elemental lord, required a lot of effort to summon. The convinced the Dark Iron dwarves to summon him to Azeroth so he could take over. Whe nwe fought Ragnaros they were in the process of summoning him, similar to Kil'Jaeden. They summoned about 10% of Rag when we showed up. Deathwing destroys the barriers between the planes of existence, so Ragnaros can now walk freely between the 2 worlds, without having to be summoned, so he's at full power.<br />

Wrong <br />
<br />
&quot;Now he lies at the bottom of that volcano on Azeroth, striving to find a way home, as well as to gather his strength once again so he can burn away Azeroth and take it for his own.&quot;<br />

On the subject of the mount, who cares, they won't remove it just like ulduar drakes so everyone will lolfarm it in Cata anyway. I would understand it if there was a time limit to get it, but they want everyone to get anything now there is no special and unique.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno, I have all 4 tanking classes, all good geared (DK 44.4k hp, paladin 44.3k, warrior 44k, druid offspec tank), and I've been tanking both ICC10/25 on all except my druid. Everytime something goes bad, people say it's because I play as DK tank. This doesn't happen when I tank as paladin or warrior. DK tanks feel underpowered compared to warriors, and especially paladins.</div></div><hr />

A disappointing trend.</div></div><hr />

They still do.<br />
<br />
<br />
And will ever do. There is no way for Blizzard to balance three trees with different playstyles to do exactly the same damage. There will always be a small difference. And this small amount of dps will be figured out and spread out to the masses via elitistjerk, so all the loyal sheeps will specc the tree with the highest dmg output, ignoring that these +20 dps isn't really relevant ingame, but more dps is more. The people that don't care about which playstyle they specc will always handle it this way, and there is nothing blizz can (and should) do against it.<br />
<br />
The whole tree-balance-thing isn't about this max-dps-players, it's about the player that actual likes one tree and wants to play it, regardless of the dps-rank for his class, but who suffers because he knows he doesn't do as much damage as the spec of the month. <br />
So lowering the difference in dmg-output results in a smaller hurt for these players and perhaps some of the others were finally convinced to play the specc they like instead of the specc that does the most damage (because the dmg is mostly equal).</div></div><hr />

That was before we (players) defeated him.<br />
<br />
&quot;After being defeated in Molten Core, Ragnaros was banished back to the Elemental Plane. He will be featured in the next expansion, World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, where he will be located in Sulfuron Keep, his seat of power within the Firelands.&quot;<br />
<br />
And this is after we defeated him.</div></div><hr />

Srsly you should atleast higher the droprate a bit or have more bosses etc drop trinkets, cuz this rly pisses me off when its a dps increase for everyone who gets it with like 1k.</div></div><hr />

i hope to god they do something interesting with the top half of Disc or it could be really boring choosing SP talents tbh because the &quot;choice&quot; could turn out basically be &quot;all of them&quot;</div></div><hr />

Okay i sort of get your comment on the trinkets from FoS HC and normal ToC5, both being the only reasonable ArP trinkets in heroics; however:<br />
<br />
Rolling on gear in 25man raids? do you PuG that shit? Expect to lose if you depend on your lucky rolls on 25man raiding. The big boys use DKP, and I lost my first DBW because the rogue officer simply had 40dkp more to spend and thus spent &quot;All Baelz has +1&quot;.<br />
<br />
But im not Butt-hurt about it; because A) he raided to get that DKP, thus helped gear me and others just being there B) It will drop again, or something else we both are highly interested in, and he just burned all I have + 1 to get what I also wanted now. So the next time, im first in line to receive said reward.<br />
<br />
On the divercity of trinkets, yes please, beacuse both DV and BW are BiS for most/all physcical dps classes, and its fun and competitive in good guilds, but it will be sour in guilds where most people arent good sports about gear.</div></div><hr />
