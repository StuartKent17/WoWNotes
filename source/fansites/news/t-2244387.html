<br />
Frost<br />
<br />
Glacial Spike’s stored Icicle damage component no longer benefits from %-damage buffs on the caster.<br />
Glacial Spike damage increased by 50%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: This prevents the Icicles from doubling %-damage buffs (since the stored Icicle damage already benefits from such buffs). The base damage of Glacial Spike is being increased so that the total damage is similar to what it was in typical situations.<br />

<br />
No, it's the part where you're stuck in the dark with a bunch of adds and have to find Illidan so you can fight them off.<br />
<br />
That ALSO changed from last Tues... you used to be able to see Raid Markers through the darkness, but not anymore. Hunters can track Illidan through the darkness with Track Humanoid so when they found him they pinged the map so everyone else could find him, too.<br />
<br />

He didn't seem to have one. We killed him after a 14mn+ fight (half the raid was dead), and it was kind of ridiculous to be honest.<br />

Thank you Blizzard for this awesome change shortly after I'd bought this item. Same like some months ago when I'd bought the Darkmoon Deck Immortality and few days later you changed the Iron Fur from Guardian Druid not to stack anymore with bonus armor procs. Can I get my gold back?<br />
