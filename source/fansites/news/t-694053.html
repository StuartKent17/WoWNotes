Upcoming Lich King Weapon Changes 
A couple of days ago a message was posted on the official Korean site to announce upcoming changes to the weapons dropped by the Lich King, as far as I know these changes affect both normal and heroic versions of the weapons. Thanks to locriani for the help with the translation!

Upcoming Lich King Weapon Changes<br />
A couple of days ago a message was posted on the official Korean site (http://www.worldofwarcraft.co.kr/community/forum/view.do?bseq=&amp;currpage=2&amp;perpage=&amp;sortmask=&amp;hfilter=&amp;pseq=783705) to announce upcoming changes to the weapons dropped by the Lich King, as far as I know these changes affect both normal and heroic versions of the weapons. Thanks to locriani for the help with the translation!<br />
Good morning from the WoW community team.<br />
<br />
Some of the weapons from the Lich King are not as good as we had hoped. To encourage you to want these new weapons, we have decided to change some of the old combat ratings over to better ones. We have obtained a preview of these changes, for your perusal, on behalf of the Beijing development team.<br />
<br />
25-Man<br />
Royal Scepter of Terenas II (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50734/royal-scepter-of-terenas-ii/): MP5 replaced with Haste Rating<br />
Archus, Greatstaff of Antonidas (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50731/archus-greatstaff-of-antonidas/): Critical Strike Rating replaced with Haste Rating<br />
Heaven's Fall, Kryss of a Thousand Lies (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50736/heavens-fall-kryss-of-a-thousand-lies/): Armor Penetration replaced with Haste Rating<br />
Fal'inrush, Defender of Quel'thalas (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50733/fal-inrush-defender-of-quel-thalas/): Haste Rating replaced with Armor Penetration<br />
<br />
10-Man<br />
Stormfury, Black Blade of the Betrayer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/51942/stormfury-black-blade-of-the-betrayer/): Armor Penetration replaced with Expertise<br />
<br />
<br />
Lich King Video by Might<br />
Might (http://www.might-turalyon.com/) (US - Turalyon) released their video of the Lich King encounter in 10-man. If you check the first seconds of the Part 2 you will see the Frostmourne room that we couldn't see in the first video I posted. <br />

Lovely Charm Bracelet from killing blows only<br />
You can get these from any mob &quot;of worth&quot; so you can do any sort of kill quest to get these including from killing any mobs involved in daily quests. [...] Yes, it comes from killing blows. On my healing character, I've had no issues with getting these, (other than when I forgot to have empty space in my bags for them.) <br />
<br />
[...] I did not get them from instances. It's pretty easy to grab a bunch of mobs and kill them solo and just as easy to get them via daily quests (or even normal questing) that you are working on as you're doing them.<br />
<br />
The event just started so, no, there are no current plans to change the functionality of this. Should we feel it's necessary to make a change, we'll let you know. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23041984974-lovely-charms-going-to-killing-blows.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking Cooldowns<br />
One caution is you have to be really careful in how you factor in cooldowns to estimates or simulations of tank survivability. Some attempts just assume that e.g. Barkskin is responsible for X% of damage not done over the course of the encounter. That might be true on some encounters, but it definitely is not on others. When you can or need to use those abilities makes a big difference. On some fights, those cooldowns just give you a little slop room if the healers have a lot on their plate or have to move or something. On others you just aren't going to survive without a cooldown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22748824209-explain-why-dru-hp-was-fine-but-not-pally-hp.html))<br />
<br />
Dispells in Cataclysm<br />
We'll talk more about the Cataclysm dispel design when we get a little closer. Overall the philosophy is that a dispel should be a counter. That means, to us, that you should have to consider when it makes sense to use. Dispels shouldn't be a test of how quickly you can mash that key when you see the icon pop up. Dispelling at the wrong time should cost you. We also don't want to see such extremely different outcomes depending on the class of dispeller you have with you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23042534523-dispels-in-cataclysm-pvp.html))<br />
<br />
Itemization in Cataclysm<br />
Actually, we aren't trying to make gear choices easier. We like when it's a hard call on whether to upgrade vs. stick with what you have, etc. In designer parlance terms, that is an &quot;interesting decision.&quot; Non-interesting decisions are typically no-brainers.<br />
<br />
We want to remove some of the confusion over a complicated stat system, which we think we can do without reducing the system's depth. In fact, the other motivation for the stats overhaul was to solve some of the problems where a certain stat trumps all or a certain stat is always junk. If we nail that, then gear choices will actually be harder in Cataclysm, not easier.<br />
<br />
As an example, when you aren't close to a crit cap and when buffs don't provide so much crit and talents don't provide so much crit, then haste vs. crit can be a pretty interesting choice. Haste lets you cast spells faster, but crit makes those spells you cast hit harder. At a very basic level you are choosing more spells vs. bigger spells, but because of a number of other factors, it's not that cut and dried. Haste may provide a dps increase for a caster according to a spreadsheet, but it depends and it might cause you to change your rotation. If you have spell A that hits so hard that you need to use it on cooldown, and spell B gets boosted by haste, then you can run into the situation where more haste on B isn't an improvement because you can't squeeze in another B before it's time to use A again. If you aren't able to capitalize on the extra haste, then more isn't always good for you. (That's in an ideal world. The way stats work in Icecrown, if you like haste, it's nearly always a no-brainer stat for you.)<br />
<br />
Comparing armor pen vs. say attack power is much mathier, because they really just both buff melee damage in pretty much the same way. The only time it matters is when you're near a cap or if you're a spec that does a lot of spell damage. But you learn pretty quickly for your spec whether armor pen is an awesome stat for you or just an okay stat.<br />
<br />
Many of your gear choices in Cataclysm should come down to haste vs. crit vs. mastery. You may still have one of those you like the most, but it shouldn't be double the value of the other stats, so you may have to look at the total package of stats on that item (Do I need more hit? If I take that hit, can I swap it out somewhere else?) Add in set bonuses and procs, and I'm not sure the gear choice will be all that easy, but it should be easier to understand.

Vanish<br />
We tried a different approach to fix Vanish in a recent patch while it was up on the PTR. It didn't fix the problem (which has everything to do with spells already being in the air) and let rogues use Vanish as a second Cloak, which wasn't the intent. When we backed out that change, we said we were going to try a different approach where we calculate when spells are launched on the server side. Nothing has changed since then and I really can't give you any more information than that. Making more &quot;Lol Vanish doesn't work&quot; threads isn't going to speed that process along, and will just continue to annoy other forum participants. <br />

Its fresh-made lore for future expansions. At some point, blizz will use lich king again. I personally think that he will help in some major battles against the Burning legion, maybe the last one. Hes combination of pure life and pure death now. Pretty op.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, it's a creation of Evil, the most sickening, cunning and awfully brutal evil known to Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Second, even if Bolvar was all good and pure in life, there's this fact that there isn't a single soul that can withstand corruption forever. There are ample signs that can lead to Bolvar's ultimate downfall to darkness: he is, well, a freaking lava-man; he will be constantly tortured, time and again by the countless trapped souls that have been gathered under the Lich King's power; although it was disputed, time and again that Ner'zhul is actually dead, I disagree... that old bastard is part of the Lich King, think &quot;source code&quot;; he sits atop a frozen throne... period. <br />
<br />
Third, from what I described earlier in my post, we can find cues to what is called &quot;recycling process.&quot; And why the heck not? The Lich King had his first go and had tested his strength and available options (and crucial mistakes). The next time his Wrath will be unleashed, he will be more ruthless, more cunning and more swift in his revenge against the mortal world. I can predict some pretty gruesome deaths under his sway... just you wait ;)<br />
<br />

this works extremely well, did my weekly with a 10 man and ended up with 18 Lovely Charm Necklaces ( ie: 180 charms ). you can do with solo, duo, whatever.

<br />
<br />
Well, there are two things that make me believe that this Lich King will be different than the other.<br />
<br />
First off, Frostmourne is shattered. Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't the sword the holder of souls? Those are all freed.<br />
Actually, this could create a lot more than we might anticipate. Maybe the reason why Frostmourne itself was never going to be the legendary for the end of the Lich King saga was because it's going to be used again in lore, instead of the obvious idea that Frostmourne will completely destroy your soul. Eh, either way...<br />
<br />
Second, Ner'zhul had a powerful hold on Arthas even before he put on the helmet. As soon as he took Frostmourne and sliced up Mal'ganis, he was already in the service of Ner'zhul and proceeded to be his go-to Death Knight. It was only until he put on the helmet that Arthas himself became the Lich King. With that in mind, we have Bolvar, who was actually able to hold off against the Lich King's will while being tortured. [as soon through the Yogg encounter] And he is able to withstand it up to when we finally get into Icecrown Citadel. Now, that's in the time-frame of Naxxramas' downfall, Yogg'Saron being killed, and the Argent Tournament going on. Lore-wise, that could be months of time. <br />
Maybe Bolvar ended up breaking as soon as we got there and he was putting on a show, but beside the point. Arthas was a willing participant of all the killing the Lich King ordered him to do. Bolvar's only reason was to stop the Scourge from overwhelming Azeroth. Could he be corrupted eventually? That could happen, and it would actually create a nice little storyline with everyone in Azeroth starting to mistrust Tirion for lying about the Lich King's death. Mistrusting Paladins? That'd be awesome.<br />
<br />
But either way, we do have one very solid fact: Mal'ganis himself swore vengeance against the Lich King [probably Ner'zhul for being duped] and he wasn't even there, so that could create some good interactions as soon as the Burning Legion becomes the Big Bad again. We actually had two big Burning Legion cameos in the Wrath cycle, so it would be interesting to see what comes from all this.</div></div><hr />

Tries to hard to be funny imho. Could be 10x better if it provided a tiny bit of analysis on the news items rather than such a broad overview its not really that interesting. i.e. Ok new arena gear, any particular class standouts, even if its funny stuff... Rogue gear looks like something a French rapist would wear. And so forth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm curious as to why they didn't add an epic sword or axe useable by Combat Rogues that has armor pen on it. Mutilate Rogues have exclusive weapons just for them that no one else will use, and they even fixed the stats to remove armor pen and improve them. Yet combat Rogues have no exclusive weapon, nor great stats on the axe that drops (presumably not &quot;fixed&quot; with the other weapons so that enhance shammys could use it). It was kind of bogus already that they nerfed Combat along with a legitimately overpowered Mutilate spec in the previous patch with poison damage reductions. If nothign else it would be nice to down the game's final encounter with some possible loot you might actually want, especially since they have some pretty lore-rich epic names and such. As is, Combat rogues will be hearthing when its time for loot. Pretty lame for an end-all boss for this expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Funny, but according to everything I've seen, the axe is still BiS for combat rogues, and the fist off 10man is BiS until you get to 25man gear. And if you're lucky enough to be in a 10man without a hunter, the crossbow has a nice amount of arpen on it. <br />
So if you're hearthing after downing Arthas, way to miss out on BiS gear for your class, nub.<br />
<br />
And stop QQing about your class getting better gear. If you think mut is getting such a better deal over combat, then spend 20 minutes doing dailies, make 50g to spend on a respec, and get those nice daggers. Either way, stop bitching and enjoy the much-needed changes to weapons that were otherwise ugly to every class out there.</div></div><hr />

They are not. The sudden loss of HP is caused by the the ability &quot;Necrotic Plague&quot;, (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=necrotic+plague#uncategorized-spells) which in fact may affect the Lich King's adds as well.</div></div><hr />

Gear choice in Cataclysm will be<br />
item A with +int (no other stats) vs item B with +stam (no other stats)<br />
After Cataclysm it will be shiny-orange item A (no stats) vs shiny-lilac item B (no stats).<br />

Don't know if it's been pointed out already but, didn't Bolvar repeated the same thing Arthas did 4 years ago? When Arthas released Ner'zhul from the prison on Ice Crown, he took up the crown and his eyes flared... then the voice came: &quot;now we, are one!&quot; Fast forward at the end of WOTLK, Arthas is dead and Bolvar receives the Helm of Domination. Again we see the same eye flash (in different color though cause Bolvar isn't a noob knight but a living flame-man) and the gradual voice change. But what strikes me the most is the ice covering him... the same thing happened to Arthas when he became one with Ner'zhul... he sat on the frozen throne, covered in ice... and began to dream. Is this then, the repetition of the cycle? Rise of the Lich King all over again, but with a different &quot;shell&quot; for the Lich King? Will Ner'zhul consume Bolvar like he did Arthas? I think we will be facing another Lich King... in time...<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's pretty obvious that the lich king will rise again.<br />
<br />
Bolvar, allegedly unbroken, voluntary takes the burden of becoming the new lichking after he watched the old lich king die. And he told Tirion not the tell anyone what had happend. So the new lichking is sitting on his throne and nobody knows about him...<br />
<br />
The question is, what exactly will happen:<br />
<br />
1) Bolvar has a noble mind, but becomes corrupted (This story get's old...)<br />
2) The Lich King foresaw his defeat and prepared Bolvar to become his new host. So all this &quot;You will never brake me blah blah blah&quot; was just theatre for the ashen verdict.<br />
3) Bolvar is worse than Arthas, because dragonfire and stuff. He fooled both, Arthas and Tirion. After Arthas is dead, he becomes his heir. The Lich King is dead, long live the Lich King.<br />
<br />
And what's also interessting:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's begun.<br />
<br />
Young heroes...I was once like you. You have come to this place seeking to bring judgement upon the damned. You will venture deep into forgotten lands. You will see wonders beyond imagining. But be warned. The land itself will rise up against you. Long forgotten terrors will smother your courage. Sacrifice everything as the final darkness falls...in the end, all that awaits you is death. Only then will you understand - you've been following in my footsteps all along.<br />
<br />
So come then, you heroes! Come in all your power and glory! For in the final hour, all must serve the one... true... king. <br />
<br />
<br />

It quite obvious that Arthas was right after all...<br />
Bolvar has come to northrend to fight the scourge, sacrificed everything and in the end became the lich king itself - like Arthas.</div></div><hr />

if you've gotten to the frozen throne, you can see bolvar hanging above the frozen throne chained up in an &quot;X-like&quot; position, when arthas is defeated he is released from his shackles, that's why he sits there and appears to have just appeared from thin air</div></div><hr />

Might as well give him the power to withstand the corruption. Ofc he won't be our ally since the lich king can't really be good, as ruler of the undead. But I don't think they will bring him back. Also, he's just a little small piece against the burning legion. When you compare lich king vs. deadwing, it's like rabbit vs. grizzly bear gone berserk.. so not really something to care about in the future when we killed deathwing(would be weird to kill that fellah 10man btw.. that's like destroying the world with 10 people.. but ah well..)</div></div><hr />

Moreover, I'm dissapointed with Casey's review of the new zombie mmo trailer. He went on to bash it without noticing the creativity behind it. It's obvious the trailer is supposed to make you think you're looking through CCTV. Subtle and tasteful for a game of that type imo. Especially when so many trailers try to dazzle you with Michael Bay-esque explosions and light shows. <br />

But alas, it was just about stat changes....disappointed<br />
<br />
honestly if the design of weapons from the last boss of the last tier of raiding is more important then the stats then maybe you should play sims or something. Like if your geting too Lich king then I'd hope your in a semi-good raiding guild and if you don't care about having properly itemized weapons as much as the &quot;look&quot; of your gear I'd be pretty upset to have to raid with you.</div></div><hr />

Of course the stat allocation is important, but you would think that the last boss of the expansion would drop weapons with unique models instead of what seemed like placeholder models.</div></div><hr />
