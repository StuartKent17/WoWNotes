Shanai posted an interesting posts on the forums a few days ago. The first dungeon sets have been added to the beta files and Cloth sets are now available.  
 
They are dungeon sets (5-man gear), they are NOT class raid sets. These sets drop from 5-man dungeons and possibly aren't even real &quot;sets&quot; with bonuses  
 
Screenshots from Ravenheart.eu are pretty good, it looks like I'm not the only one in the world who is crazy enough to do that kind of stuff." />

Cataclysm Beta Build 12604 - NPCs Transcripts (Spoiler)<br />
I'm not a huge fan of spoiling lore and dialogues but the requests for transcripts of sounds files have been overwhelming. From now on, I will list new sound files after each beta build and try to provide a transcript for them. (In this case I also included a couple of audio/videos, courtesy of Tural (http://www.youtube.com/user/TuralX18))<br />
<br />
Obviously, do not read anything below if you do not like spoilers<br />
<br />
Thanks to Marla for the transcripts of this patch. <br />

Deathwing<br />
VO_QE_Deathwing_Event01.wav - &quot;Lifebinder. Do you presume that I am at your beck and call? I have a world to unmake.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Deathwing_Event02.wav - &quot;Ha ha ha ha. End? Me? Lifebinder. You think life is yours to take away? Life is weak. Mortal. Fleeting. Fragile. Death is final. Death is eternal. Death is my realm. Look upon me, and you see death incarnate. The unmaker... of worlds.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Deathwing_Event03.wav - &quot;Then witness my new gifts! Bestowed by this worlds TRUE MASTERS.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Deathwing_Event04.wav - &quot;Just as all life ends in death, all order must end in chaos! Come! Embrace the inevitable... as I have!<br />
VO_QE_Deathwing_Event05.wav - &quot;The sun has set on this mortal world. Make peace with your end, for the hour of twilight falls!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Deathwing_Event06.wav - &quot;Argh. You think to entrap me?!&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
Sylvanas<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_GIEvent01.wav - &quot;Enough!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_GIEvent02.wav - &quot;Such a waste! That arrows poison was not meant to be spent on your whelp! We will meet again.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent01.wav - &quot;Where is that ogre-headed buffoon.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent02.wav - &quot;Ah. Speak of the devil.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent03.wav - &quot;Warchief. So glad you could make it.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent04.wav - &quot;With the death of the lich king, many more of the intelligent scourge... became unemployed. Those feens as you so put it, are mine now.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent05.wav - &quot;And they are part of the reason I asked to see you.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent06.wav - &quot;Very well, Warchief. I have solved the blight of the forasken.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent07.wav - &quot;As a race, we forsaken are unable to procreate.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent08.wav - &quot;With the aid of the Valkyr, we are now able to the corpses of the fallen, and create new forsaken.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent09.wav - &quot;Agatha! Show the Warchief.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent10.wav - &quot;Warchief! Without these new people, my people would die out. Our hold on Gilneas and Northern Lordaeron would crumble.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_SP_Sylvanas_SPEvent11.wav - &quot;Isn't it obvious, Warchief? I serve the horde.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event01.wav - &quot;I have not always been the Banshee Queen.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event02.wav - &quot;And my people have always been the Forsaken.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event03.wav - &quot;Long ago, this land comprised the Northern Kingdoms of Lordaeron, ruled by King Terenas Menethil.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event04.wav - &quot;Terenas, had a son named Arthas.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event05.wav - &quot;Arthas. Even saying his name makes my body quiver in rage.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event06.wav - &quot;This manchild, &quot;Arthas&quot;, took for himself a cursed blade, known as Frostmourne.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event07.wav - &quot;Through Frostmourne, Arthas killed his own father, and raised this land along with every creature in it.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event08.wav - &quot;My own death, came at the hands of Arthas. When he and his army &lt;sacked&gt; my homeland Quel'Thalas and murdered my people.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event09.wav - &quot;In his vast cruelty, Arthas severed my spirit from my body, and raised me as a banshee to serve in his scourge army.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event10.wav - &quot;A similar fate befell all that would die to the scourge warmachine.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event11.wav - &quot;In death, they were reborn as mindless undead.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event12.wav - &quot;But Arthas was not invincible. With each passing day, his power wained, his grip over the will of the damned loosening.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event13.wav - &quot;It was when Arthas was at his weakest, that I struck.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event14.wav - &quot;And though the hour of his atonement had come, the worm managed to escape his fate, returning to the frozen wastes of Northrend.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event15.wav - &quot;With Arthas gone, so to was the control he held over the undead masses of Lordaeron after recovering my body, I freed the remaining scourge that were left behind.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event16.wav - &quot;From the cruelty and mercilessness of Arthas the man who would be Lich King, the forsaken were born.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event17.wav - &quot;Our goal, our sole purpose was to destroy the Lich King. We through our lot in with the Horde, and began our journey to redemption.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event18.wav - &quot;Now, the Lich King is dead. And we have returned.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event19.wav - &quot;The people that called the land their home in life, do so in death as well.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event20.wav - &quot;But the Alliance does not recognise our rights, they claim this land is their own while attempting to invalidate the claims of the founders of this kingdom.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event21.wav - &quot;I will never allow it. NEVER.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Event22.wav - &quot;Lordaeron belongs to the Forsaken. Always and forever.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Hunt01.wav - &quot;You can assure Garrosh, that this is a minor setback. Our victory in Gilneas will be absolute.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Hunt02.wav - &quot;You do well to watch your tone, general. Neither you nor Garrosh have anything to worry about. We've ceased all production of the plague, as he ordered. We'd never deploy it without his permission.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Hunt03.wav - &quot;Go with honor, General.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Sylvanas_Hunt04.wav - &quot;What kind of question is that? Ofcourse we are deploying the plague, as planned. Let the Gilneans enjoy their small victory. Not even their bones will remain by tomorrow.&quot;<br />

<br />
Garrosh<br />
VO_QE_Garrosh_SPEvent01.wav - &quot;This better be important, Sylvanas. You know how I detest this place and it's foul stench. Why have you called for me?&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Garrosh_SPEvent02.wav - &quot;And more importantly, what are those scourge beigns doing here?&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Garrosh_SPEvent03.wav - &quot;Get on with it, Sylvanas!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Garrosh_SPEvent04.wav - &quot;What you have done here, Sylvanas. It goes against the laws of nature. Disgusting is the only word to describe it.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Garrosh_SPEvent05.wav - &quot;Have you given any thought to what this means, Sylvanas?&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Garrosh_SPEvent06.wav - &quot;What difference is there, between you and the Lich King now?&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Garrosh_SPEvent07.wav - &quot;Watch your clever mouth, bitch.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Garrosh_SPEvent08.wav - &quot;Gro'mash, you stay behind and make sure the Banshee Queen is well guarded. I will be expecting a full report when next we meet.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_Garrosh_SPEvent09.wav - &quot;Remember Sylvanas, eventually we all have to stand before our maker, and face judgement. Your day may come sooner than others.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_Aggro01.wav - &quot;I will show no mercy!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_Aggro02.wav - &quot;&lt;something orcish&gt; Lok'norosh!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_ElEvent01.wav - &quot;Don't talk back to me Troll, you know who was left in charge here. Haven't you stumped to ask yourself why Thrall chose me instead of you?&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_ElEvent02.wav - &quot;You are lucky that I don't gut you right here, whelp. You are foolish to think you can speak to your warchief in such ways!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_ElEvent03.wav - &quot;And what exactly do you think you're going to do about it? Your threats are hollow. Go slink away with the rest of your kind to the slums. I will endure your filth in my throne room NO LONGER.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_ElEvent04.wav - &quot;You have sealed your fate, troll.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_Event01.wav - &quot;Hahaha! Yes I live! No Twilight dragon can keep this orc down!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_Event02.wav - &quot;Ah. There she is. The battle maiden of the Dragonmaw. Let me see your face.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_Event03.wav - &quot;Blood and honor, hero. The horde welcomes you. Your people will be put to the test, as we obliterate twilight's hammer, and lay claim to this distant shore. But first, some unfinished business..&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_Greeting01.wav - &quot;Hellscreams eyes are upon you.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_Greeting02.wav - &quot;Leave by these words! Lok'tar ogar! Victory or death.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_Greeting03.wav - &quot;Only the strongest may dwell in Orgrimmar.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_Greeting04.wav - &quot;You will serve the horde, or be crushed beneath it.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent01.wav - &quot;What have you done, Grom'gar?&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent02.wav - &quot;My command?!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent03.wav - &quot;Was my command to murder innocent, Grom'gar?&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent04.wav - &quot;Am I a murderer, Grom'gar?&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent05.wav - &quot;Then I ask you again, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent06.wav - &quot;I sent you into Stonetalon Mountains with an army, your orders were to secure this land for the Horde.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent07.wav - &quot;Instead, you layed waste to the land. Murdered innocents. Children even.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent08.wav - &quot;I spent a very long time on Northrend, Grom'gar. I learnt much about the Horde in that time.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent09.wav - &quot;While there, a wise old war hero told me something, that I would carry with me forever.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent10.wav - &quot;Honor, Grom'gar. No matter how dire the battle, never forsake it.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent11.wav - &quot;Overlord Grom'gar, you have disgraced the Horde!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent12.wav - &quot;You have brought shame to us as a people.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent13.wav - &quot;By my right as Warchief, I hereby RELIEVE YOU OF DUTY.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent14.wav - &quot;You. Are. Dismissed!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent15.wav - &quot;And you...&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent16.wav - &quot;Mercy. Your wife and child were murdered. Your kin wiped out. Your home burnt to the ground.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent17.wav - &quot;Mercy. Chieftain. On this day, I learn from you.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent18.wav - &quot;Grom'gar's army is no more. Your rank no longer has meaning. If you wish to truly help the horde, your considerable power could be used in Desolace, or in the Southern Barrens.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent19.wav - &quot;The choice is yours to make.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent20.wav - &quot;Let honor guide you. Do not forget that Hellscream's eyes are always upon you.&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_TILEvent01.wav - &quot;Fellow warriors of the Horde, hear me now!&quot; <br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_TILEvent02.wav - &quot;Ahead hides our foe. Worshippers of chaos, who seek to remake our world. A new world is coming, friends. But it is not the world of their design. Together, we will crush the Twilight's Hammer. Raise their stronghold. Raise the earth, and burn the bodies. All will tremble by our might. Then we will stand (upon?) this world as its masters. United at our conviction. Unrivaled in strength. Behold into no one! (?) Today we will make the world, our world! FOR THE HORDE!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_TILEvent03.wav - &quot;The Alliance steams in close formation without escort. Air guard, attack! Strike them now while they can not manouvre! Hahahahahah!&quot;<br />
VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_TILEvent04.wav - &quot;Get. Off. My. SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIP.&quot;<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Class Development Status<br />
I'd say that at this point in time, the trees that are farthest along are mage, rogue, shaman and warrior. Paladin would be close except that things have changed so much that we still have to move talents around quite a bit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262927372/a-few-words-on-talent-tree-design/))<br />
<br />
DPS Classes Overhaul<br />
Sure, and Fury is the kind of tree that needs a lot of adjustment because so many of the talents are &quot;you do more damage&quot; of various kinds (and there are still some we haven't been able to prune quite yet). But I've also seen a lot of posts where say a Shadow priest or Feral druid imagines they are getting a paladin-level overhaul with half of their spells new. Neither the Shadow or Feral trees are done yet, but the bones are there. You'll see talent slide around or maybe one or two new ones added, but they aren't getting new resources (unless you call the orbs a resource), and we aren't removing say Lacerate or Mind Flay. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262927372/a-few-words-on-talent-tree-design/))<br />
<br />
Raid Buff Costs<br />
The thing is, Rampage is a sizeable dps increase for 1 talent point. If all you ever do is raid and you know you'll always have another version, then I guess you're safer skipping it. If you ever solo or run 5-player dungeons, it's a nice benefit to have. If you have the luxury of spending your dual-spec on your solo Fury build, then again, Rampage might be a luxury. This is one of the reasons though that we are hesitant to offer more specs. At one talent point, Rampage should be a no brainer. If it cost 2 or 3 points for a buff someone else might bring, then I could see skipping it in a raid.<br />
<br />
Likewise, if like the Frost mage, every Survival hunter, Ret paladin etc. decides that someone else will bring Replenishment, then nobody will have it. :(<br />
<br />
Talent builds are supposed to be about evaluating the pros and cons of every talent. If you can quickly tailor your talent build to the other folks you are playing with, then you are just avoiding the cons. Situational talents can be skipped until you're in the situation that needs them. Dual spec was conceived so that players could tank or dps or raid and PvP, not so that you could skip over situational talents and yet still be able to use them as needed. For all the good that dual-spec has done, it has done some harm too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262927372/a-few-words-on-talent-tree-design/))<br />
<br />
Vengeance<br />
Think of Vengeance like the way Tricks of the Trade works on live. It isn't the silver bullet that is supposed to solve all your threat problems. It's there to make sure that other classes don't outscale you as you keep piling on Stamina and they keep piling on damage.<br />
<br />
Your normal threat rotation should be sufficient to keep aggro in most situations. Vengeance falling off periodically shouldn't be a big deal. Offtanks without Vengeance shouldn't be a big deal. We want you so still care, insofar as tanks ever care, about the damage you're doing. Vengeance is a cushion, not the solution to threat management. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262707768/plans-for-the-vengeance-mechanic/))<br />
<br />
Tanks and DPS Talents<br />
It is particularly a challenge with tanks once they are ready to sub-spec into other trees. A Prot warrior for instance looks at the Arms and Fury tree and sees all these dps talents, and assumes he has to get all of those to hold threat. Yet, we can't very well make the top two tiers of Arms and Fury with no dps talents. Hopefully the way it will work out is that tanks will need &quot;some&quot; dps and can decide whether to get those talents in Arms, Fury and Prot, but won't feel the need to get them all.<br />
<br />
There are some tanks who get some things &quot;for free&quot; while others need to talent into it. As long as the end result is similar it should feel okay. Part of what we are dealing with is all these brand new talents or old favorites that have changed a lot. You don't have the years fo experience and theorycrafting to fall back on so you don't know (yet) if say Thunderstruck is mandatory (it shouldn't be).<br />
<br />
There will be some amount of dps talents in all trees. Some players will call any dps talent that doesn't require them to click something &quot;passive and boring&quot; but we also think there is a limit to the number of procs, stacking buffs, and using base spells in unusual ways that a player can manage. We'll have some of those talents for sure, but not 20 of them per tree. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262927372/a-few-words-on-talent-tree-design/))<br />

Death Knight Rotations<br />
One thing I'll throw out there is we're definitely trying to keep the feel of Unholy with a more predictable rotation and Frost with more of a priority system, since what ability to use next can't always be guessed in advance. DKs seem to like those play styles for the two trees respectively. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262927588/dk-tanks-and-being-rune-locked/))<br />

Hunter Redesign?<br />
No, hunters are not undergoing any kind of massive redesign. We have spent our efforts lately on trying to make sure focus works as intended in both aspects and at low and high level. We're not there yet. We'll work on the talent trees a little more when we feel like focus is where we want it to be, since that will affect the talent design.

Holy Power as Protection<br />
It's entirely possible there isn't enough Holy Power to go around for Prot yet. We want you to be able to consider things like Inquisition and Word of Glory. Remember too that it's only 15% block. If it falls down from time to time, you're unlikely to drop dead. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262766511/paladin-shield-of-the-righteous/))<br />

Raging Blow / Fury in the Blood<br />
Raging Blow -- We want this to be an ability that can't be used 100% of the time. We don't want Fury to have very static (and boring) rotations. We're going to try to keep Fury enraged a lot without it being 100% up time (somehwere in the 75% range sounds better). As such, we're not crazy about a design that lets you hit Raging Blow whenever you want. It just waters down the ability. (In fact, we feel the same way about Execute and are considering redesigning Sudden Death for Arms). We think we can make Fury's use of enrage predictable enough without being totally under player control that your dps won't fluctuate wildly from fight to fight.<br />
<br />
Fury in the Blood -- I think a little bit of the &quot;we won't be able to use our utility abilities correctly&quot; is a little overblown. For starters, you don't need to use Bloodrage and Berseker Rage all that much. Fury has a lot of other ways to generate rage, and fears just aren't super common in PvE and you have other ways to break them in PvP. In those situations where they do come up, we think it's an interesting choice. Is the boss going to fear? Maybe you want to save your Berserker Rage for a few seconds and use it then. There are going to be very, very few fights where it's a true dps loss to delay or save your Berserker Rage for the right time. Frankly, we'd rather have encounters feel more different like this, where abilities are more valuable or have to be used differently sometimes. I compare it to Arcane's mana gem talent. Sometimes you want to use the gems for mana and sometimes spellpower and sometimes both. That makes the decision on when to use the gem deeper than just &quot;on cooldown.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262707531/raging-blow-redesign/))<br />
<br />
Now all of that is really just an endorsement of Raging Blow, not Fury in the Blood. In fact, with Raging Blow being the primary reason to stay enraged, we're just not sure we also need the bonus damage from the Fury in the Blood abilities. With say Enrage and Death Wish providing the enrage sometimes, you should have to fall back on Bloodrage and Berserker Rage less often, which should let you save them for emergencies more often (but not always, as I said above).<br />
<br />
In short, we like Raging Blow, but not Fury in the Blood and will likely redesign the latter. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262707531/raging-blow-redesign/))<br />
<br />
Intended use of Bloodrage<br />
If you have to pop Bloodrage on cooldown for rage, then we've failed. It's there for emergencies, not as the primary way you gain rage. Hitting things is the primary way you gain rage.<br />
<br />
Just because rage won't always be unlimited doesn't mean that it will go to always being limited either. If that was the case then we wouldn't need abilities like Heroic Strike or Inner Rage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227192817/warrior-changes-12539-and-12604/))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nekosom</div><div class="date">2010-07-26, 10:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, cloth sets that actually look like their made of cloth. What a novel idea! I like the elegant simplicity of it. Not gaudy like BC cloth gear or bulky like WotLK. After all, these are casters, they shouldn't look like they're wearing bulky armor. In Vanilla, they're fancy-looking robes, and that's all. That's the way it should be. I hope all the armors return to the basics. No more of this Gears of War armor nonsense.<br />
<br />
And if you don't like the hats, too bad. If you're going to do magic, you should look like a wizard or a witch. Reroll as a warrior if you want to look like you're on steroids.<br />
<br />
I'm look forward to seeing hunter gear. I've felt out of every class, hunters have never really had a golden age of gear. I loved their BC gear, but they've always, even since Vanilla, had big bulky, gaudy-looking gear. And to me, that's never made sense for hunters. How are we supposed to reach for our bow when our shoulderpads are bigger than our heads? Keep the bulky gear with plate-wearers. So even though this is just a dungeon set for cloth-wearers, I hope this is a sign that Blizzard is starting to embrace simpler-looking gear.</div></div><hr />

Nah, they were new, the same models applied to the armor class, and each class/role (they weren't class-restricted) had different skins. Caster had either a cowl or a floating tiara, etc.<br />

Remember, you are playing World of Homogenization.<br />
<br />
The expansion after Cataclysm will see all classes merged into one hero class where we all get to play as a &quot;Tankmageshadowhealerpetdin&quot; and the existing classes get removed.<br />
<br />
That way they only have to make one armor set for the entire game whilst focusing on what REALLY matters, pet store.</div></div><hr />

One thing I'll throw out there is we're definitely trying to keep the feel of Unholy with a more predictable rotation and Frost with more of a priority system, since what ability to use next can't always be guessed in advance. DKs seem to like those play styles for the two trees respectively<br />

They look orite but probably /helmoff<br />
<br />
<br />
there arent the teir sets so my 1st reaction to this was dungeon sets and pvp sets will have the same models agian. you guys need to get over the fact there gonna do that to the lesser used sets. sorry pvpers but true fact is alot more people care about raiding then pvping these days heck i havent even seen a pvp guild this expansion.</div></div><hr />

The tree currently requires 37 points just to get the talents that require dps. If they add more talents that people actually want they are going to have to give up something else which is something no other class has really had to do. Where is the 10 points for other trees. They need to streamline not add more. There is no excuse to make people spend more than 31 points in the tree for all the talents they want that aren't situational.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't bother me that all sets look the same per armor class, as this is only prep gear and is intended to be replaced.<br />

What's up with the FF reference? In general, wizards wear a robe and a wizard's hat, which is what these sets are. The two pictures that were linked with the &quot; = &quot; between them look nothing alike, except for the basic wizard model and color. Just because two different games (and many many more) have a &quot;wizard&quot; wearing a robe and hat doesn't mean one copied off the other.<br />

Mine was actually a Masters of the Universe reference, but okay. And I never said they copied from it. It just looks a lot like Orko, and it's not hard to make that jump between the mage sets and him.</div></div><hr />

Deathwing just sounds like Thrall with throat cancer.<br />

He's the only decent voice actor they have. Even Arthas sounded like a boy from highschool &gt;_&gt;<br />

Suggested course of action: Fire whoever voiced Deathwhisper.<br />
Hire actual voice actors rather than having street urchins and Blizzard employees hold the mic.<br />
<br />
Also, make more armour sets, who cares if you recycle old vanilla gear from MC and BWL, those weapons looked awesome compared to lolwitch cloth gear &gt;&lt;<br />
And create varying environments: It is odd that it doesn't rain or snow anywhere in Northrend but in set locations. And make a day night cycle too, missed that in Northrend too.<br />

The only models in WoW that are unique are hand held, head slots and shoulders. Heck we don't even see the necklaces we wear :/<br />

If there is one department WoW has always severly lacked in, it has to customization of appearance and variation within existing models. Chestplates, gloves, leggings and boots can be just as iconic as head slots and shoulders but blizz hasn't spent the time to make it so.</div></div><hr />

Reusing the same armor set is lazy and boring because it makes everyone look the same. Why is it bad to say that?<br />

They are dungeon sets (5-man gear), they are NOT class raid sets. These sets drop from 5-man dungeons and possibly aren't even real &quot;sets&quot; with bonuses <br />
<br />
NOOO! The first dungeon set looks worse than Tier 9!<br />

You can view it as lazy and boring, or you can realize they'd rather spend their time on other more important things in the game than a dungeon set that people aren't going to be using 2 months after the game is released. There's various ways to view this, but being pessimistic about it generally doesn't help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There isn't a way to actually 'help' in this situation but each to their own. Personally I think it's a shame that any armor model is ever reused in such an obvious way. They don't need to reuse the same model to make the loot from different quest look good together.</div></div><hr />

Are cloth sets really that overpowering the changes to classes, the world, features are overshadowed by it? Which to me look pretty interesting and work with in the future (The new features and world etc).<br />

The tree currently requires 37 points just to get the talents that require dps. If they add more talents that people actually want they are going to have to give up something else which is something no other class has really had to do. Where is the 10 points for other trees. They need to streamline not add more. There is no excuse to make people spend more than 31 points in the tree for all the talents they want that aren't situational.<br />
<br />
With the new mastery system which forces you anyway to spend those 31 points into the talent tree, there is no need for ANY DPS talent which ain´t situational. They keep talking how they want players be able to chose, but still all classes are bloated with faster caste here, better frostbolt there talents. Mandatory talents are worthless, they could do include those into the mastery itself. Reach 10 Points in Shadow, get automatic for free shadow form. Get 20 Points into it and get something else awesome.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think it's a shame that any armor model is ever reused in such an obvious way. They don't need to reuse the same model to make the loot from different quest look good together.<br />
<br />
You have to remember the models of gear are purely aesthetic. They serve no real purpose other than appeasing the people who care about what their character looks like and with that should be much lower on priority than say designing the stats on the gear itself. Sure a lot of people care about how they look, but when you're talking about gear that's going to be on a character for less then a month how can you really argue the looks of it? It's one thing if it's the tier sets that you'll end up wearing a few months, but dungeon gear and blues/greens are hardly worth arguing over their model design since it's really not worth the time at all.<br />
<br />
It's a simple matter of how much effort is certain gear worth taking the time to design, and greens/blues and dungeon sets aren't worth it compared to tier gear because of how quickly people will be out of it.</div></div><hr />

Every single quest reward model should be allocated the same amount of time. The only items that should have more time taken over them are the tier sets. Just because you take an extended amount of time over 1 thing is not an excuse to recolor 1 model of anything and call it 'done'.<br />

Clearly you didn't play WoW in vanilla, they gave us a new god damn model, you should be happy about that shit rather than bitching about it being reused a handful of times. You want to bitch about reused gear, play 1-60 again, then we will talk. This is whats called looking a gift horse in the mouth.<br />

WHAT!? That is a straight up Hunter / Rogue gear. God I'm so sick of Blizzard getting gear looks mixed up for the classes.<br />

Yeah, I agree it looks very Warhammer Witch Hunter like, it would suit a hunter or a rogue better with a modified skin. But if that were the case people would be pissing and moaning that they just copied Warhammer, people draw whatever connection they want based on the connotations its presented in.

<br />
One of the biggest complaints I have with this game is that as time has went on the armor sets have become worse and worse. I would love to go back to a vanilla type architecture. Every class had it's own cool and unique looking blue dungeon set, and the epic sets in raids progressively seemed more epic looking, not just rehashes of the same old models, and not WORSE looking than the dungeon sets. (save personal preference)<br />
<br />
Heck, I would be happy if they did look worse as long as they were at least different models from one another from the bottom up. NO RECOLORS!</div></div><hr />

<br />
To what degree are you speaking of? The fact that blues and greens have similar models? Who cares when you'll be moving on to dungeon gear and epics once you hit 85. <br />
<br />
This is what you want: Them to spend time on mostly meaningless FILLER gear until you reach 85 so that you look good while leveling. Do you realize how silly that sounds? I'd much prefer they spend their time on other much more meaningful things than gear that will get overlooked and passed upon once you get to 85. <br />

The amount of time you wear gear IS a valid excuse for it's model design time 'allowance' because why the hell would you spend time designing a green to the level of an epic quality item when maybe one person in the game will continue to wear it at 85 for more than a week? It's a complete waste of time and resources.</div></div><hr />

The fact that blues and greens have similar models? Who cares when you'll be moving on to dungeon gear and epics once you hit 85. <br />
<br />
This is what you want: Them to spend time on mostly meaningless FILLER gear until you reach 85 so that you look good while leveling. Do you realize how silly that sounds? I'd much prefer they spend their time on other much more meaningful things than gear that will get overlooked and passed upon once you get to 85. <br />

I would agree with you if they actually make the epic sets look epic. I've been mostly disappointed in this expansion.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately that's purely opinion. I actually like a few of the t10 better than anything else in game (shaman and warrior to be precise). That doesn't mean they don't allot the a necessary amount of time to design this gear just because you don't like it though.</div></div><hr />

If they are going to make Sinestra an ultra-hard boss like Algalon.. I want audio to be better. Model is nice, brings back style of Kil'jaeden, but the audio.. Make it more like Algalon's epicness sounds please.<br />
<br />
Dungeon Sets are nice, at least, they are DUNGEON sets, not RAID sets. I would be disappointed hardly if those would be RAID sets. Luckily those are not.</div></div><hr />

White mages wear hoods, red mages wear feathered hats, so no in their regard. As far as black mages go, yeah they look similar, but FF just got the idea from witches. It seems like they are goin for a victorian look with those sets, hence the witch's hat, not the black mage hat.<br />

This goes for greens, blues, epics the whole 9 yards.<br />
<br />
One of the biggest complaints I have with this game is that as time has went on the armor sets have become worse and worse. I would love to go back to a vanilla type architecture. Every class had it's own cool and unique looking blue dungeon set, and the epic sets in raids progressively seemed more epic looking, not just rehashes of the same old models, and not WORSE looking than the dungeon sets. (save personal preference)<br />
<br />
Heck, I would be happy if they did look worse as long as they were at least different models from one another from the bottom up. NO RECOLORS!<br />
<br />
You sir live in a fantasy world. Dungeon Sets WERE the end game raid sets back in vanilla, they didn't have molten core finished forever. Gear from level 1-60 was practically the same, the exact same peices reused over and over. It took them atleast a year to make Tier 1, they were reusing models up until that point, they released unique ones after people were already progressing in MC. I suggest taking off those rose colour glasses you have on and really trying to remember what it was like gearing up in Vanilla.<br />
<br />
If you honestly think every set thats released is worse then the last ones, not only are you an idiot, but you will never EVER be happy. You are infact a clingy whiney dipshit who will never be happy with concession you are given by blizz. Its a fucking generic ass dungeon set, get the fuck over it and get on with your life, stop hating Blizzard for all the months you have wasted in front of your computer. Its one thing to express WHY you dislike a GIVEN set, but to make sweeping generalizations in a fucking beta... just makes you an idiot.<br />
<br />
Its a generic ass dungeon set, its not supposed to be epic as hell, shooting lasers out of oversized shoulders and shit. In that regard its actually quality work compared to everything up until this point and its a unique model, something they don't usually give us if you look at the past.</div></div><hr />

Well, what the eff do you want, then?

What do he I mean we want? These models look like Blizzard outsourced them to people with half kidneys in the Philippines. Is THIS enough for you? Is that an excuse that this is a leveling gear? Think about it a bit. Blizzard should make normal looking gear, not these wretched ones. I feel myself like I'm Harry Potter, oh where's my magic stick...

I hope you are right and we won't see these sets ever again. I don't know how many illustration art books have you seen in your life, but these sets are nothing compared to what Blizzard has ordered from all kind of professional illustrators around the world. Just order a WoW and/or Diablo art book and look around what kind of ubercool models could be made. Somehow those armors never get into the game, whyyy? Surely because a lot of effort is made :).<br />

You have got to be kidding me ...<br />
<br />
If that stuff is so epic then the stuff we have now is GODLY. 99% of it is reskinned quest rewards, and some just quest rewards with no color changes whatsoever. Hello tiny shield that drops off Ragnaros. Yeah you're right. That thing is WAY more awesome than any shield in ICC. Malistar's Defender is the name incase anybody wants to look it up. This will get me shit but even the model for Thunderfury is nothing really all that impressive compared to now. If Thunderfury had never been in game and that model was a new model for ICC it would have been bashed to hell and back. Gear looks better now than ever and while some may not please your own personal taste it is definitely a higher quality. Maybe some of you should actually go look at Vanilla gear and then gear from WotLK or Burning Crusade and come back here because there is honestly no logical way you can claim the old vanilla stuff is of a higher quality or design.</div></div><hr />

Every gaming company does it. Not everything in FF is original. Not everything in WoW is original. Not everything in Starwars is original. Not everything in Harry Potter is original. Yet people whine like this is the first time it happened! I bet most of the people whining are really young and have seen nothing in this world yet (Which technically is quiet acceptable since they have nothing else to do).<br />
<br />
Hollywood copies other movies or say, inspires from them.<br />
<br />
Most 5 star hotels are copies of each other.<br />
<br />
Most car models are inspired by another, within the same company or different. <br />
<br />
Most restaurants have the same menu.<br />
<br />
The human mind has a limitation to it's imagination. It takes some serious thinking and a very long time to come up with something completely original. And people who do usually spend their entire life doing it. <br />

Avatar is one of the most successful movie of all times and it also had a bit of WoW and Johnny Quest going on in it.</div></div><hr />

This is making me think deathwing isn't the big end game baddie in Cata, just a tool to the old gods. Thinking a old god is possibly the end of Cata boss after DW maybe</div></div><hr />

My prediction is that as the expansion progresses, Garrosh is going to grind the Horde into the ground by putting his iron in too many fires and spreading our forces too thin. And then near the end, there's going to be some major crisis, like maybe Deathwing attacks Orgrimar, and instead of holding his post and commanding his people, he's going to run off to fight DW himself. Obviously, he'll get beaten. If he's lucky, he'll die then and there, but if WE'RE lucky, he'll come back licking his wounds, and we'll get to take the opportunity to kick his ass but good. But what will probably happen is Thrall will step in and oust him. Then if Thrall doesn't retake command himself, he'll put Saurfang in charge.</div></div><hr />

In the VO_QE_TI_Garrosh_STEvent set of transcripts, it should read &quot;Krom'gar&quot; not &quot;Grom'gar&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have got to be kidding me ...<br />
<br />
If that stuff is so epic then the stuff we have now is GODLY. 99% of it is reskinned quest rewards, and some just quest rewards with no color changes whatsoever. Hello tiny shield that drops off Ragnaros. Yeah you're right. That thing is WAY more awesome than any shield in ICC. Malistar's Defender is the name incase anybody wants to look it up. This will get me shit but even the model for Thunderfury is nothing really all that impressive compared to now. If Thunderfury had never been in game and that model was a new model for ICC it would have been bashed to hell and back. Gear looks better now than ever and while some may not please your own personal taste it is definitely a higher quality. Maybe some of you should actually go look at Vanilla gear and then gear from WotLK or Burning Crusade and come back here because there is honestly no logical way you can claim the old vanilla stuff is of a higher quality or design.<br />
<br />
This. No offense to people who played back then, but there really isn't any disputing the quality of how the gear looks now. Everything in Vanilla was blocky and full of primary colors. It look extremely cartoonish. The gear from WotLK is some of the best looking sets Blizzard has created (excluding t9, but that's a personal choice). Priest, Mage, Paladin, Warlock T8, Mage, Warlock, Death Knight, Shaman T10 are some of my favorite sets in the game.  I'm not a fan of these sets, but as people said it's probably going to be the leveling/questing/dungeon greens/blues that you'll be rid of in a month.</div></div><hr />

They fucked up Deathwing, he sounds like Thrall and he doesnt have a metallic tone to his voice, fuck fuck fuck.</div></div><hr />

When wow started we used to have many sets for different classes, I don't know why they all go with one simple set as we all need only 1.<br />
<br />
But about the lore. I'm speechless. Specially the parts where Garrosh talks to everyone, he, he just screw it all. The most strongest thing is hear him to say &quot;bitch&quot; to Sylvannas, a bit rude language for a game who is mainly naive themed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I didn't like the older Deathwing voice, this is still better.. But sounding like Thrall, I don't know, maybe he IS Thrall.. That's why Thrall was so &quot;peaceful&quot; leader.<br />
<br />
Wow. Surprise from Blizzard when we kill Deathwing, he forms into Thrall.<br />
<br />
GJ Horde ._. &quot;You just earned the achievement [Whoops..]!&quot;</div></div><hr />

The rest is pretty damn cool I must say. Deathwing has a little tinge of metallic gravel to his voice which suits his character quite well. Still, this is going to be yet another Chris Metzen voiced by Chris Metzen, directed by Chris Metzen and acted by Chris Metzen. Oh yeah, story written by Chris Metzen.</div></div><hr />
