Onyxia Solo Kill<br />
Yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7985.0) we talked about a 5-man Gruul kill, today we might have something even more impressive, an Onyxia solo kill (http://warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=76343) by a Druid ! (Serennia (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Cho%27gall&amp;n=Serennia) from V A N Q U I S H (http://www.vqguild.net/) on US-Cho'gall)<br />

<br />
Below is a small part of the comment posted on Warcraftmovies (http://warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=76343) : <br />
<br />
As anyone that has ever done Onyxia with a low amount of people knows, there is a bug in the encounter that existed even pre-BC that causes one of her warder patrols to aggro during the second phase if she happens to be flying over the south end of her lair at the same time that the patrol is there. To combat this bug, and to allow a guildmate to spectate, I brought in a hunter from our guild that would immediately suicide at the start and remain dead unless this bug happened to occur. In the event that the warder would aggro, I would combat rez him so that he would help kill the warder, and then immediately die again without any further assistance in the fight. Most would agree that this is still considered a solo feat despite having to do this to combat Blizzard's design flaw.<br />
<br />
If you watched Ted's solo attempt movie, he states that fire resistance gear and certain talents/strategies are required, which as you can see from this, that it is not. The only real requirement to do this is to make sure you have -5.6% crit reduction, which is around 226 resilience. This should hopefully encourage other people seeking a challenge to attempt a solo Onyxia. Ted also stated in his movie description the following:</div></div><hr />

Kinda hard to enter a raid instance without being in a raid. As was explained, the hunter committed suicide and was only battle rezzed to take care of the warder that came down halfway through the fight. The Boss itself, along with the normal whelp adds, was soloed by the druid.</div></div><hr />

Right, because a respawned trash mob is a designed element of the boss fight.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crimsonak</div><div class="date">2008-05-27, 03:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you watch the video of the kill, you notice at the start he introduces the hunter, says stuff about him being there so that in the event of a bug he can be combat ressed and used to deal with it.<br />
Now, if you watch at the start of the video he clearly died at the middle/entrance to the cave.<br />
<br />
I was suspicious to begin with by the fact his &quot;fast forwarding&quot; wasnt really that, it was a black out and then a rephase.<br />
Long story short this bug occurs and the hunter is ressurected. However after the very long time it takes him to kill this new spawn. It takes care not to show you where he died.<br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious what could've quite easily been done is he DPS'd and then just feigned whenever the filming was happening.<br />
<br />
Not saying thats what did happen since he was clearly capable of getting through phase one, even though it took a while. I dunno I guess I just don't like the way it was edited. Really odd to me.</div></div><hr />

Long story short this bug occurs and the hunter is ressurected. However after the very long time it takes him to kill this new spawn. It takes care not to show you where he died.<br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious what could've quite easily been done is he DPS'd and then just feigned whenever the filming was happening.<br />
<br />
Not saying thats what did happen since he was clearly capable of getting through phase one, even though it took a while. I dunno I guess I just don't like the way it was edited. Really odd to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You're retarded. Watch again; the Hunter dies near the hills a Hunter would usually DPS. He is then raised from that very same spot, drags the Warder near the tank wall, and dies there.<br />
<br />
It's not that hard to see people. Open your eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I have watched it. Several times.<br />
There is no dispute he died at the start, since he was resurrected at the same spot later on.<br />
<br />
However before you go calling people retards.<br />
maybe you should be the one to watch the damn movie again. <br />
Since it CLEARLY fades to black while the hunter is still alive.<br />
And then when the clip resumes he is &quot;dead&quot;<br />
<br />
At NO POINT, does it show you where, or how he died.<br />
And from that point onwards, he goes on to edit fade outs often enough to get away with the hunter actually being fiegned.<br />
It is so easy to do DPS, and then feign on the same spot where you were previously between the edits.<br />
The hard bit would be actually dying again on the same spot, because of the knockbacks and fears.<br />
Since it is not shown, how or where he died. At all. It means you can raise this question.<br />
As i've said before im not saying it was done, but it's damn well plausable.<br />
<br />
It's probably not what happened and you're right in saying that, but since the video doesnt really cover the 100% true aspect of it. You can't really say<br />
<br />
Next time before you post, maybe you should practise what you preach and gather evidence for your claims. Watch the movie.</div></div><hr />

I would say it's a solo kill.<br />
<br />
I find it unfair to say, because the mob respawnd and got aggro'd due to Onyxia's location at the south of the cave, and the druid needed help to take it down, that it doesn't count as solo.<br />
I've done Onyxia before, (pre-tbc), and you don't encounter those mobs during the fight ofc. So having someone take care of it would be an easier way through it, and i would count it a solo kill. But if the hunter did any dmg to Onyxia or the whelps, it should redeem it's title of solo. As he had interfered with the encounter.<br />
<br />
The encounter is;<br />
Normal DPS,<br />
Air, whelps and DPS,<br />
Fear and dps.</div></div><hr />

You're looking too hard. There is no sarcasm. He's saying a warlock killed a level 70 raid level boss while a resto druid revisited a level 60 raid level boss. Warlocks &gt; Resto Druids, in this case.</div></div><hr />

No, the warlock was kiting Hydross. Which makes it totaly different.<br />
The druid was resto, and used resilience-gear to tank Onyxia.<br />
<br />
So lets list solo boss kills:<br />
<br />
Azuregos - Hunter. Bug: Mend Pet was affected by +healing<br />
Hydross - Warlock. Bug: Ability to kite Hydross without taking enough damage to die, and without adds spawning.<br />
Onyxia - Druid. No bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are quite a few, but the fact is before most bosses you do full clears before angaging the boss, and if that boss &quot;owns&quot; those patrols they do not respawn for the duration of the encounter.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd count it a solo kill in it's strictest meaning only if the hunter in question was there for countering the unintended side effect of the patrol. If the hunter deals any damage, does any aggro, or suffers any damage from the boss, or even buff anything, then it's not a solo kill since the actual boss attempt must be perfectly clear of outside help.<br />
In every other solo sport you have precautions against if something unintended happens, but if the precaution interfer with the result or in any way aid one of the competitors, even the slightest, that persons result will not count and a retry or disqualification is in order.<br />
<br />

I'd much rather have seen 3 people in the raid. Another healer and the hunter. Patrolling up and down the entrance clearing out any respawns. Then they could remain out of the battle area to deal with said warden &quot;bug&quot; and the druid could solo the encounter as a 40 man raid would deal with it. <br />
<br />
One could argue that warden's respawning and social aggro'ing is a sort of &quot;enrage timer&quot; on the air phase. If you take too long, it respawns and joins the fight, completely wiping you (or you and your group). Perhaps it wasnt intended this way by blizzard, but it sure seems familiar to what we've seen on countless other bosses.<br />
<br />
Also, the hunter DOES in fact gain some aggro from the whelps (even if a few seconds before a moonfire hit).<br />
<br />
Being able to solo it without any help at all would truly be the greatest. Sure it requires multiple people to form a raid, but that doesnt mean the other person has to even zone in (cept maybe to speed up trash clears).</div></div><hr />

Therefore in my eyes, it isn't a solo kill.</div></div><hr />

Attumen the Huntsman - Karazhan<br />
The Lurker Below - SSC<br />
High Astromancer Solarian - TK<br />
Mother Sharazh - Black Temple<br />
<br />
I'm sure there is more, considering we rarely pull bosses without clearing trash first.<br />
Possible other bosses would be:<br />
<br />
Al'ar - TK<br />
Supremus - BT<br />
Gurtogg Bloodboil - BT</div></div><hr />

And that hunter didn't do any damage to onyxia or adds so that was a solo kill<br />
and the name of the video is &quot;solo Onyxia&quot; not &quot;solo Onyxia+warden bug&quot;<br />
<br />
PS.Did you notice that paladin soloed Onyxia too but he didn't aggroed a warden so that warden isn't part of the fight like I said it's a bug.<br />
<br />
PPS.I really think that Serennia could do it without hunter friend if he's lucky enough not to aggro that warden.</div></div><hr />
