<br />
Historically that would make sense (2 months after official announcement)... speculation it could be September 23rd, though. 6.0 on August 12th or 19th... but that is probably wishful thinking :) The fact that they are giving away beta keys at the event...although that would still be 4-5 weeks of beta access.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. I think WoD is going to wind up being one of the best expansions since WotLK, in my humble and accurate opinion.</div></div><hr />

Trouble with that is Blizzcon gets in the way of progression unless they release it so the first raid opens the week after Blizzcon.. that might work.<br />

I'm still going for end of November to tie in with the 10th anniversary.</div></div><hr />

September 11 - Burning Crusade announced to be released on January 16, 2007 (~4 months)<br />
September 15 - Wrath of the Lich King release date announced to be November 13, 2008 (~2 months)<br />
October 4 - Cataclysm release date announced to be December 7, 2010 (~2 months)<br />
July 25 - Mists of Pandaria release date announced to be September 25, 2012 (2 months)<br />

If Warlords is released before November, what the hell else will Blizzard have to showcase and hype? The third campaign in Star Craft 2? 6.0 hasn't even hit the PTR yet, half (or less than) the raid bosses have been tested, and the pre-event is going to last four to six weeks prior to the release. <br />

Late October for the pre-event/6.0 and early December for release which gives them enough time to re-hype the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why deny past trends? It's clear Blizzard likes to announce the release date 2 months in advance.<br />
<br />
Just because 6.0 hasn't hit the PTR yet doesnt mean it won't in a week or two, which would still give 6.0 Live around a month of time before release.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzcon isn't JUST about WoW. There are 2 other games with expansions still to be announced/previewed, and there is still another game Blizzard is working on that they have showed us nothing about, so there is a chance (albeit a small one) that this could be teased.<br /> 
<br />
Finally, why have Blizzcon show WoD AGAIN? They already revealed much of it at the last Blizzcon, what else could they possibly give us that is new? Anything new would be stuff implemented in later content patches, which they would do anyways if the game was already released</div></div><hr />

October 14 - Release Date<br />
October 21 - Heroic Highmaul Opens<br />
October 28 - Mythic Highmaul Opens<br />
November 3-5 - Method, Midwinter, Blood Legion, etc. defeat the 7 mythic bosses in Highmaul<br />
November 7 and 8 - Blizzcon and the live raid featuring Method and Midwinter in Highmaul<br />
November 11/18 - Blackrock Foundry Opens</div></div><hr />

Won't work, with Blizzcon on 8/9 November it would hit progression. WoD has to be released either late september (yeah right) or after blizzcon (probably)</div></div><hr />

Your statement is just as stupid if you think it's December. They never have and never will announce a release date 4 months prior to the release. The track record of every expansion has been 2 months which is a fact that you cannot ignore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You think 6.0 is going to be released before it's on the PTR? Or are we assuming 6.0 is already being tested right now in beta?</div></div><hr />

It's equally stupid speaking as if you know jack when, clearly, you don't. ;d.<br />

No one knows, being OPTIMISTIC or HOPEFUL, is never stupid though. Also, do they EVER release expansions to PTR before actual release...?</div></div><hr />

Yep, internal testing...plus, ALL of the 6.0 stuff minus any pre-expansion events are being testing on BETA - only needs to go to PTR for a week or two to iron out any last minute issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Warlords is released before November, what the hell else will Blizzard have to showcase and hype? The third campaign in Star Craft 2? 6.0 hasn't even hit the PTR yet, half (or less than) the raid bosses have been tested, and the pre-event is going to last four to six weeks prior to the release. <br />
<br />
Late October for the pre-event/6.0 and early December for release which gives them enough time to re-hype the expansion.<br />
<br />
Pretty much this.</div></div><hr />

There was a 1 week gesture of goodwill time to claim your (pre-order) Wings of Valor before Diablo 3 RoS came out. It will be exactly the same with the Horde choppa and WoD. Also, let's not forget that MoP was released on September 25, 2012. I would be surprised if Blizzard doesn't want to meet the psycholgical important 2-year mark with a September 23 release for WoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the difference? The broad strokes of the expansion are already well-covered, and we're seeing the minutiae adjusted week by week. What could they possibly talk about that would make for a wildly satisfying pre-launch experience?<br />
<br />
The most interesting stuff they could possibly talk about at Blizzcon at this stage in the expansion's lifecycle is the future of it--future tiers, concepts and so forth--and I would argue that having the expansion released already would make that easier.</div></div><hr />

The pre-patch 6.0 will be live 2-3 weeks before WoD is released, and the (very short) PTR 6.0 starts shortly (quote Bashiok).</div></div><hr />

That's not how they do things anymore. Maybe it changed in MoP but Cataclysm was released before it was ready, and I'm not talking about the lack of max level content.<br />

They dont need to ptr the 6.0 patch tho. And even if they do(wich i dont think they will) its notgonna need 3 weeks of testing. Whats there to test? The talents are being tested on the beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is plenty to show off at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
To actually play it themselves, yes, but what percentage of people hardcore enough to go to Blizzcon do you think could really be blown away by something a WoD beta panel has to offer at this point, especially also factoring in 6.0's release which will get a portion of the changes into people's hands at least?<br />
<br />
Bear in mind that I'm not saying people would be wowed by the alternative either, it's not gonna throw your hair back like a brand new reveal either way. I just don't think sitting on the expansion until after Blizzcon is any kind of trump card from a presentation point of view. If there's a reason to wait, it's so people wouldn't have to interrupt actually playing it to go there.</div></div><hr />

November 17th is the 10 year anniversary of wow So having the expansion release at November 17th 11:59pm would be one of the coolest things they could possible do.<br />
Also blizzcon is Nov 7-8th so it would be roughly 1 1/2 weeks after blizzcon.<br />

Wasn't it out on November 23 2004? That would be an interesting way to market.<br />

<br />
Now, my best bet for the release date itself would be late October/early November. It would just fit to aditional beta testing, 6.0 release and about 1 month of testing on live.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER... There are two more factors to put in the mix. Blizzcon and Warcraft anniversary. <br />
<br />
Considering there will be an Arena Tournament in Blizzcon... It seems strange to have a Tournament in level 100 with WoD's status and rules, since PVP Season may not even be started on live in the worse prediction... And if it did start, it would be just a few days on! Adding to it that November 23rd is Warcraft's 20 anniversary... And there are plenty of reasons to have a mid-late November release!<br />
<br />
That would be a bit late though, in my opinion. So I still stick to a late October/early November release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Warlords is released before November, what the hell else will Blizzard have to showcase and hype? The third campaign in Star Craft 2? 6.0 hasn't even hit the PTR yet, half (or less than) the raid bosses have been tested, and the pre-event is going to last four to six weeks prior to the release. <br />
<br />
Late October for the pre-event/6.0 and early December for release which gives them enough time to re-hype the expansion.<br />
<br />
Plenty... Yes, the SC2 expansion. Heroes of the Storm. Diablo 3 stuff. Future patch ideas for Warlords. Release in December would crush sub numbers. Besides, they keep saying things like &quot;we don't have the time to finish blood elves for launch.&quot; Launch in December would give them plenty of time for that. If 6.0 hits early to mid September, that allows for 4-6 weeks of pre-WoD content.</div></div><hr />

The build you play on beta servers isn't always the build that Blizzard dev's are testing internally. The build you play could have a bug that was fixed a month ago in the internal build.</div></div><hr />

If you have ever beta tested other software but video games you will realize a company is releasing the beta because they want to test the bugs. These bugs are being fixed, though they may not be released on beta server. The version of the game on the beta server is a &quot;test&quot; version only. Yes, Blizzard has spoiled us in the past with finished beta projects but I feel that doing it this way will bring better game play for release. The game development is finished. We wouldn't be in beta if it wasn't.</div></div><hr />

He's probably of the mind set of the copy pasters of the '80% of content is being removed!' crowd(like the one Bashiok had to respond to).<br />
<br />
I'm actually surprised at some of the stuff we're getting. We're getting more models than we expected at Launch, lots of specs have more variety and options with their final tier of talents(I'm loving S-priests in particular), moreso than we've had before, and excited about the PVP changes :D. Barely anything has been 'cut' and much more has been added in that time since Blizcon.</div></div><hr />

That is correct. Titan was rebooted and people diverted to the other franchises while the core team reworks the engine.<br />
<br />
That is what they said, anyway... It may be likely Titan will join Lord of Clans and Starcraft:Ghost in the blue afterlife...<br />

The cinematic is guaranteed to get me hyped no matter what. The Wotlk, Cata and ofc original cinematics give me chills even to this day, and every now and again I watch them all to get inspiration to play :P (not that I need it to play, it's just epic and gets me all pumped up :D )<br />
<br />
Looking forward to it, and a date at last.</div></div><hr />

By viewing that list it is rather easy to see it will be launched on Nov 23. BUT that is a ... Sunday ...?!?<br />
<br />
20 years after the first Warcraft game, 10 years after WoW and WoD will have a final lvl 100 mark.<br />
<br />
If I were Blizzard I would reset WoW with a complete new leveling system to avoid an endless 110 etc...<br />
<br />
Also: the next WoW &quot;expansion&quot; will be the movie in March 2016 ... Perhaps time to reset things with WoW2 or an adapted version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, and I would attest to October if 6.0 has been on the PTR. It hasn't and the beta is still far from feeling like a &quot;finished&quot; product. I know betas normally never get that feeling, however there is a lot more than two months worth of things they need to implement. However, if it were to come out in october it would interfere with the progression race, which is something they won't do. At best this game will release two weeks after blizzcon, however if it does it will be even more rushed than it already is feeling based on things being pushed back just to make a release date.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is not going to delay a release because some people might be racing to kill bosses....<br />
<br />
And they have previously had a PVP tournament after a major patch release.<br />
It was around the WOTLK time, they used an old version to do the finals because the game was updated after the season was over.<br />
There is no reason they wouldn't do that again.<br />
<br />
The shit would hit the fan if they delayed the expansion release so they could prepare and work on blizzcon content and panels....</div></div><hr />

These are not all of blizzards release only some of them, and while there are many in november there are also many who arent in november.<br />

This is what they have allways done, you just didnt know it because they didnt tell us.<br />

Except as usual people are ignoring the fact that the 6.0 pre patch has yet to even appear on the PTR, that it will be up on the PTR for 2-3 weeks before going live, and that they mentioned that the 6.0 pre patch will be live for 6+ weeks before WoD is released. All of that would have to happen TODAY for there to be any shot at a mid October release. And lets not forget that a mid October release puts the progression cycle directly on top of Blizzcon.

And you are forgetting that the expansion release is always two months after the announcement of the release date. By announcing the release date next week, as of now, the most likely month is October if Blizzard follows the pattern they've had for the last four expansions.<br />
<br />
History is not on your side for this. And given that they ARE announcing the release date next week, I would expect 6.0 to go up on the PTR within the next week or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So release date is probably november tuesday the 11th of november or october the 7th. Due to blizzcon and world first race they can't really put it in between those dates, without screwing the worlds top raiders over.<br />
<br />
As can be seen in this thread, the release date has generally been exactly 2 months (within a few days) after the announcement of the release date. Oct 7th is closer to two months after august 14th than nov 11, but it's also less than two months which would be a new one.<br />

<br />
There's a lot more going on at Blizzcon than just WoW. Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Legacy of the Void, maybe some D3 stuff, and they can always talk about 6.1 if they want. Hell, maybe even titan but let's not hold our breaths. <br />
<br />
As for a launch date, mid oct is clearly the best time to launch. It gives them 3 weeks to fix any major issues before blizzcon, gives the players 3 weeks to level up and work on raid content, and gives them a solid month of sales before black friday, where they can cut the price in half like they did for MoP and pick up more sales without pissing everyone off who bought a month earlier. <br />
<br />
If they can't get it up by 10/21 we will not see it before december. They cant release the first, second, or fourth week of nov because of blizzcon and thanksgiving and they wont release the third week because if something goes crazy the thanksgiving holiday will complicate getting support. <br />
<br />
My guess: <br />
<br />
6.0 PTR goes up on the 8/19<br />
6.0 Live goes up on 9/1 (we already have the beta to judge how a lot of mechanics will work, ptr is just a last check)<br />
6.0.4 launches on 10/14<br />
<br />
That seems pretty reasonable to me.</div></div><hr />

6.0.4 launches on 10/14<br />
<br />
That seems pretty reasonable to me.<br />
<br />
Majority of people who go to BlizzCon are WoW players who are meeting up with their guildmates, friends and &quot;family&quot; there. Deny it all you want, maybe there's the Starcraft folks who go or the D3 folks who do, but who is going to BlizzCon just for the Hearthstone stuff?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who's denying anything? Just pointing out that there's still plenty to talk about. Besides what could they possibly talk about at blizzcon for WoD at this point that wouldn't be rehased or just irritating to hear? I'd much rather have had the game for a few weeks and have them fill time with &quot;Oh man, garrisons are great, and here's the blood elf model that'll be patched in and here's what the theme of 6.1 is&quot; etc than be still waiting for the expansion in november and having them show us stuff we already know is coming or worse, show us stuff from 6.1 when we don't even have the game yet.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, there will definitely be new content to discuss for WoW no matter when the release date is but it would be better if the game was already out by blizzcon. The window to make that happen is small.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also they can release the expansion without allowing us access to the raid instances especially Mythic mode. In fact, if they require normal clear for heroic and heroic clear for Mythic, that's 2 lockouts right there, right? Personally I'd love it if they didn't open raiding for a week or two, so I could level at a pace that would actually let me enjoy myself.</div></div><hr />

No matter when they release it we pretty much allready know everything about whats going on in WoD at release. They might/probably will do a live raid though. They HAVE to have something else planned for blizzcon to make it last several days.<br />
<br />
I wonder what it is. I hope its something new cus i dont see how the movie + starcraft expansion + Heroes of the storm can actually fill up the time<br />

The ppl battleing for world first are allways horribly undergeared for it. They wont take their time to crawl through heroics first, unless they actually gate it.</div></div><hr />

Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm, Legacy of the Void, maybe some D3 stuff, and they can always talk about 6.1 if they want. Hell, maybe even titan but let's not hold our breaths. <br />
<br />
As for a launch date, mid oct is clearly the best time to launch. It gives them 3 weeks to fix any major issues before blizzcon, gives the players 3 weeks to level up and work on raid content, and gives them a solid month of sales before black friday, where they can cut the price in half like they did for MoP and pick up more sales without pissing everyone off who bought a month earlier. <br />
<br />
If they can't get it up by 10/21 we will not see it before december. They cant release the first, second, or fourth week of nov because of blizzcon and thanksgiving and they wont release the third week because if something goes crazy the thanksgiving holiday will complicate getting support. <br />
<br />
My guess: <br />

lol exactly - maybe if someone bought a heroic run 3+ months ago...even then at the gold prices I have seen - you are paying for the mount (and if it didn't include the mount you got ripped off...)</div></div><hr />

Sort of. They had a release window in mind and instead of announcing the release date, they announced it was going to take them a little longer and they were pushing it back. The only reason they announced it so far out is they knew they would miss the window and needed to chill people out.</div></div><hr />

I'm having a good laugh at people like you each year too, then when they announce the release date I sprint over to MMO champion to see whine threads by people like you saying, <br />
