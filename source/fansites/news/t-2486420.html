Absorbs no longer prevent dazing?

Yeah okay, exactly why change something that hasn’t been a bad thing since, what, Vanilla? Why take away one of the few ways non-tanks can prevent being Dazed that doesn’t involve shelling out gold? If Resounding" />

Absorbs no longer prevent dazing?<br />
With mount equipment coming to Patch 8.2 Rise of Azshara, we've noticed that absorbs no longer prevent a player from being dazed and being dismounted while being melee hit from the back.<br />
<br />
Yeah okay, exactly why change something that hasn’t been a bad thing since, what, Vanilla? Why take away one of the few ways non-tanks can prevent being Dazed that doesn’t involve shelling out gold? If Resounding Protection was such a problem then change the trait to no longer prevent dazing. Messing with our Absorbs from spells is wholly unnecessary. What was so broken about it that it was perfectly fine gameplay for over a decade?<br />
This change was not intended. We’re investigating the issue and plan to fix it in the Rise of Azshara PTR as soon as possible.<br />

World of Warcraft players have become... something else over the past few years.</div></div><hr />

It's like watching a I wanna-talk-to-your-manager Karen write on a gaming forum, pretty funny really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, even if i could understand his feelings after seeing that &quot;bug&quot;, not being polite is mostly useless because if blizz would like to duck you up it would definitely do it regardless the feedbacks, the hate and so on. So not being polite is worth nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate first person though, rather have a 3rd person camera that's less top down like WoW, but more behind the character like Mass Effect / Witcher 3 / AC Odyssey.</div></div><hr />

Happened in that thread about four posts after the blue. <br />
<br />
And it's not exactly impossible either. This change would have been pretty in theme with ones they've been making lately. Glad it was just a bug.</div></div><hr />

That is for sure something they would usually change and then condescendingly explain to you why it's better game design this way.</div></div><hr />
