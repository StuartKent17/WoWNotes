Trap Hotfix<br />
Alright. I'm forwarding info from a designer with more information on what we're working on to increase the amount of elite creatures available for trapping.<br />
<br />
The hotfix that will require a realm restart to take effect to increase the availability of elite creatures by splitting the elites off into its own population group. Previously, the elites and their regular versions shared the same population pool. Splitting the elites off into their own population pool will help them repopulate more quickly.<br />
<br />
However, because the spawn regions for the elites are so wide, players fighting on one end may not see elite creatures repopulating on the other end of the spawn area. To address that, another hotfix is being worked on to greatly increase the number of spawn points with a further increase to the spawn rates. This other hotfix will also require a realm restart so we're holding off until both hotfixes are ready so the issue can be addressed thoroughly in one go. (You don't want two separate rolling restarts.)<br />
<br />
With regards to concerns over the change to require tap credit to trap, we think is in part to due the scarcity of elite creatures. With the hotfixes above in place, there should be ample supply and it'll address those concerns.<br />
<br />
We are looking at making possible further improvements beyond the scope of what hotfixes can allow to the Barn and trapping mechanic to encourage group play and reduce the need to engage in unusual behaviors. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/355892-trap-stealing/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15701393585?page=22#435))<br />
<br />
Follower Limits and Accessibility<br />
25 with a level 3 barracks. Anyhow, you can collect them all but you can only have a maximum of 25 active at any one time.<br />
What Doraine said (with the caveat that you may have to switch up certain Garrison buildings and/or Outposts to gain access to certain followers).<br />
<br />
All of this feedback is great so thank you!<br />
<br />
We have some really cool changes coming to Garrisons in the future and a lot of them are based on what you've shared with us in recent weeks. Also, I've relayed many of the ideas you've posted here, too.<br />
<br />
One specific change I can share is in the next patch we're planning to add a new NPC to tier 3 Garrisons who will sell followers you might not have access to based upon which buildings and Outposts you've chosen. Definitely keep an eye out for that on the next PTR, test it out, and let us know what you think.<br />
<br />
Ohhh, what about for followers that came from quests that give you a choice of three but you can only choose 1. Gotta catch'em all you know <br />
Yup! You'll be able to browse for followers you did not choose from quests and any you might have missed from failed missions.

<br />
Warlock Class Balance<br />
I give you credit for replying to this thread. Id love to hear your thoughts on shamans BTW... <br />
<br />
But according to simcraft (Im sure you are aware of the website/tool), warlocks are only ~2k above tanks, and 5k from the top. Big gap.<br />
<br />
Sims can be helpful from time to time, but far more helpful are actual log parses from humans playing those classes, and that tends to be what we look at; as well as just reading feedback, and our own play experience. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/355886-where-are-the-warlock-buffs/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15699373865?page=23#442))<br />
<br />
New Model Changes and Feedback<br />
We pay attention to the feedback on all articles, as well as all your comments here on the forums. We're making additional adjustments to some of the new models for the other races, including the Night Elf running animation, thanks to player feedback. <br />
<br />
That's not to say it'll be possible to implement every suggestion that was made regarding the Blood Elf models of course, but we're keen to make sure you love the new models as much as we do.

Please stop making &quot;Spiky thing with a doorhandle&quot;-style fist weapons. They'd spin out of control first hit.<br />
WoW weapons have never really been about realism, per se. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/550136708499394560))<br />

Any plans for alchemical catalysts? Seems like a pretty weak reagent and we don't have much to use it for other than greater flask<br />
Yeah, I'm an alchemist myself and found the same, the feedback's been sent off, I feel you. In the meantime, engineering owns. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/550136445944344576))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
So, is there any good reason why the blueprints for level 2 large buildings cost more than Level 3 blueprints?<br />
Level 3 blueprints require a pretty hefty achievement, topping that with a huge cost felt bad. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/550136858072465409))<br />
That does make a lot of sense, but a 500g discount for time investment doesn't seem all that much, no?<br />
Some guy was complaining earlier that they didn't cost enough! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/550158065387831296))<br />

Green Tweets<br />
The developer formerly known as Ghostcrawler has managed to outweet all of the other devs we are tracking combined in the past few days, and had some interesting things to say. Keep in mind he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Classes<br />
in retrospect, was it really worth diluting gameplay quality so that more could participate?<br />
I still struggle with that question. Is it better to have a good experience for few classes or viability for all of them?<br />
giving melee+range comps less DR category overlap is another way.<br />
You can get more class representation by letting multiple classes bring X but then you risk losing class distinction. At the end of the day, supporting multiple diverse classes as equals is almost impossible. My suggestion for any aspiring RPG designers out there is have only a few classes if balance is a goal. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/551199584009994240))<br />
<br />
Must all new classes in WoW be hybrids? Is it bad for the game (LFG queues) to add another pure dps class?<br />
I think the game can support pures, so long as the hybrids are satisfied doing less DPS, which is a hot button topic.<br />
Do you think it's possible to add a 4th role? Could it be done by adding it to the next new class, and only to that class?<br />
You would make that class mandatory for every raid group. If you could live with that decision, then sure. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552249538291847169))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
I think I transmogged one item, and I was largely the designer of the system. And I found a bug with that one item... I think it was a fan. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552250218616344576))<br />
<br />
what was wow's biggest problem/headache that you can recall during WotLK?<br />
I don't know if this is the biggest problem, but creating a niche and need for the DK was a challenge.<br />
interesting. not what i expected.<br />
There were more. Naxx being easy followed by Ulduar being hard was challenging.<br />
I got the feeling Ulduar was not as well received at the time as some portray. The next tier seemed rushed out.<br />
Ulduar was popular for the tiny percent of players who saw it. Flex mode normal would have helped it a ton. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552225539268677632))<br />
<br />
Game Design<br />
No idea how to solve a fundamental game design problem: optional content must be interesting but not so interesting that you're compelled. I see this is a lot in DA:I and WoW. If optional content is too boring, nobody will do it. Too interesting and it feels no longer optional. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552225333575835648))<br />
<br />
A lot of the optional-turned-mandatory content feels that way because of the presence of overly compelling rewards.<br />
I agree, but it's not just rewards though. AC and DA:I offer a lot of low reward content that is still hard to skip over.<br />
At some point (was it achievements?) we became programmed to hate skipping over optional activities (frequently collections). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552226128333529090))<br />
<br />
I would say it all depends on your definition of 'interesting'<br />
There is a ton of collection in the new Dragon Age, but many clearly feel bad about not doing it (which is the entire point!). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552226358332379136))<br />
<br />
Being compelled because it is interesting is awesome. Being compelled to do something optional strictly for reward is no fun<br />
I agree, but there is also a trend of optional never feeling optional no matter how lame or non-rewarding it really is. I am *not* an achievement-focused player, but I still picked up a lot of freaking feathers and posters in Assassins Creed games (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552226614302355456))<br />
<br />
It can be frustrating if it's presented as optional but is important. It isn't optional at that point.<br />
Right. Devs are clearly trying to present bonus content for completionists, but then we feel bad skipping it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552227002929778688))<br />
<br />
I can make a game with 1000 quests that feel mandatory. That's easy (but a lot of work). Having 100 mandatory and 900 optional is harder. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552227482787528705))<br />
<br />
there's a bigger issue - artists want their art to be seen.<br />
That's always a concern (and using art = craft) but in this case I believe the devs *want* the content to be optional. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552228481501638656))<br />
<br />
I will never play DA:I again because of this and I really wanted to <br />
Exactly. Bioware wanted shards and other collections to feel optional for folks who wanted a 200h game. But I think it backfired. You hear complaints of too much content, even from crazy gamers like us. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552228938315866112))<br />
<br />
But what if you want to offer 100h to one type of player and 40h to another? How to make *some* content feel optional? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552229309343997952))<br />
<br />
WoW had TONS of working optional content. you could do pet battles. or start doing dailies to get the squirre pony from TotC<br />
WoW pets are a great example. They went from rare rewards for a few to something many had the expectation they were going to get. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552232925593219072))<br />
<br />
I'd prefer if games were made directed at a specific audience. People would enjoy them more. Even if it was less people<br />
Budgets can be a challenge there. Unless your specific audience will pay a premium for the game, you have to make it smaller. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552249311048654848))<br />
<br />
IMO, if you make content interesting, people will feel compelled to complete it, &quot;optional&quot; or no.<br />
But what if it is not? What if it is an awful grind? I assert many will still do it (and be mad). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552250556052275202))<br />
<br />
devs seem to think &quot;it's optional but we'd still like EVERYONE to do it&quot;. &quot;Optional&quot; means many ppl WONT do it- AND THAT'S OK<br />
Yes, that is my point. It is good to have optional content. Keeping it optional is surprisingly hard to design. You almost find yourself trying to design somewhat shitty content for fear that everyone will do it (meaning now non-optional). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552251084538785792))<br />
<br />
Isn't this solved via multiple possible paths? You get one option, and you have to play again to explore other options?<br />
I like that the best, though it is strictly more work/content than the main+optional model. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552296433534377984))<br />
<br />
But is that not the purpose of all gaming companies. To hook the gamer in and keep them coming in.<br />
Ultimately, but you do risk driving players away if they are overwhelmed. It's a big ask to say &quot;Trust me. The 100 hours you are about to spend will be worth it.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552297022146232320))<br />
<br />
that's the problem with you people. You have to always overcomplicate things. I bet none of this was important on vanilla WoW<br />
Leveling to 60 was the entire game for most players and they didn't rush through it. Player behavior changes in 10 years. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/552475043142578177))</div></div><hr />

They keep nerfing monks singletarget dps, where they are not topping the dmg meter, and by doing this they also destroys ww pvp. <br />
They should stop nerfing the singletarget dmg overall and start by maybe taking a look at the &quot;Earth,Wind,Fire&quot; spell and maybe give a small boost to the singletarget dps. <br />

A hybrid is a class that can do damage, as well as perform a different rolen(tank/heal) properly while in the same spec. This means you do less damage in exchange for that other role, such as shadow priests healed a substantial amount while doing less damage in MoP. So it has nothing to do with the other roles a class can perform when changing a spec.<br />
<br />
Fistweaver monks are atm in my opinion the only viable hybrid spec atm.</div></div><hr />

No, that's not what a hybrid is at all. At no point in history has Blizzard ever defined a hyrbid as a class that can perform 2 roles at the same time. A hybrid is defined as a class that can perform more than one role by switching specs and adjusting gear.<br />
<br />
Mages, Warlocks, Rogues, Hunters cannot under any circumstances ever switch to healing or tanking. The other classes can still spec into tank or heals if they chose to do so. Just because you cannot do it at the same time still doesn't' mean you're not a hybrid. <br />
<br />
&quot;Hybrid classes are classes which can fill more than one of the core PvE roles: tank, healer, or damage dealer (DPS). Realistically, no character can tank, heal, and dps at the same time, but hybrids are frequently flexible enough to serve in one role or another (no matter what spec they have) if they have collected the gear required to serve that function. ALL classes have at lease one method of fulfilling the DPS role, non-hybrid classes are sometime referred to as “Dedicated DPS” classes.&quot; (http://www.wowwiki.com/Hybrid_class#toc)</div></div><hr />

I don't think that is a good definition. Where is the difference between the druid that DPS in Moonkin and then between fights respecs and changes gear to tank as a bear and a mage that DPS and then relogs to his paladin to tank ? There is none.<br />
The only advantage to being a hybrid is to do several roles at the same time. In Vanilla that was possible and the hybrid tax made at least a little sense back then but right now it would make no sense.</div></div><hr />

You're as ignorant as him. Hybrids were from the old talent system where you could make your toon heal or tank or dps in the same fight without switching specs. That is no longer possible. Think before hitting submit so you don't make a fool out of yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You pretty much answered you own question. That's the difference, you only have to level 1 class as opposed to 2 (or 3 if you want to be hardcore like that and prefer to heal, tank and dps with completely separate classes)<br />
<br />
However, whether you think it's a good definition or not is largely irrelevant. Mages are still pures, in that they cannot tank or heal with their chosen class. Druids in this case are still hybrids. Changing specs between between encounters is a huge convenience compared to having to log in to another character as well as not having to have a full second set of gear (since you cannot trade gear between your characters, save for BOAs). With the way gear works, it's now possible to actually use some of the DPS you obtain in your tank or healing specs. I can't really say to which degree this works, as I don't tank or heal with my hybrids. <br />
<br />
I no longer play a pure class as over the years, you have to admit, things have gotten much better for hybrids overall while pures really haven't changed all that much. Some still have only 1 good dps spec for either PVE or PVP. But still doesn't change the fact that as a pure, if you want to join raid that is full on DPS, you're shit out of luck, whereas a hybrid can push a few buttons, assuming of course you have the gear or even the desire and go as healer or tank. With the hybrid tax gone, hybrids are more attractive than ever.<br />
<br />
I wont get into the whole utility argument, or what buffs certain classes bring over others, or even if they actually manage to make all 3 pure dps spec equal, that's a whole other can of worms. But my original point still stands. If your class has the option do something other than damage, you are by definition a hybrid. How you go about playing your class really doesn't change this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And those have been the times when being behind in DPS was fair. Those times ended pretty soon tho, but the dps penalty did stay. Why should anyone take a hybrid with him when that hybrid can only do dps at a fight anyway while pure dps classes can have a higher dps? Hybrids are not bringing more utility to a fight anymore...sure you can switch specs but for that you need a second gear and a lot of experience(time investment) to perform on top level with it(and no...when we are talking about fights that are tight enough that your dps actually matters then you can not just switch specs and play with the same gear.). A pure DD could as well level a second toon for such a case(with free level 90 boost it's quite easy).</div></div><hr />

To be fair,he's not far off.League's only downside is the terrible community which comes with every free game sadly,despite that it's very well designed and gets finely tuned regularly.I'm afraid I can't say the same about WoW.WoD has been in beta testing for 10 months if I am correct and all we got was bugs,lots of em some of which are still(!) not fixed yet and since I main Shaman I think it's unacceptable that it took 10 months of testing and Shamans went live the way they did.</div></div><hr />

How is LoL not for hardcore players (no matter if he said it or not)? You need many games (300+?) to get to lvl30 and even after that, many people probably play 1000+ games. Your perceived difficulty doesn't have anything to do with it (which I assume is your point).</div></div><hr />

You could, for example, partake in the &quot;multiplayer&quot; part, actually talk to that random person (most people are surprisingly nonhostile), form a group, and then a) both still get a trapped beast out of it and b) be even faster by killing stuff it in a group.<br />

As of now being a hybrid is simply convenient for those who like to play 2 roles or more without switching characters.<br />
<br />
plate wearers step up for their turn to pick what to do.<br />
<br />
Paladin steps up, picks up sword and shield as their first choice, two hander as their second and says &quot;for my third choice I want to be able to heal myself&quot; and got healing abilities.<br />
<br />
Deathknight steps up and picks up two hander for tanking, then dual wielding for dps and then says &quot;I would like to be able to command armies or creatures to aid on fights. and he got the ability to summon pets <br />
<br />
warrior steps up, run and tosses himself on the weapons and rolls around on them while yelling &quot;I am pure! I am Pure! why can't I hold all this weapons!&quot; and his hands became big enough to carry big weapons.<br />
<br />
that is how all classes work, no hybrids in this game.</div></div><hr />

[Require a realm restart] Spawn rates for Direfang Alpha, Ironhide Bull, and Wetland Trampler has increased slightly.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh noes. How am I gonna farm these on my windwalker monk and my rogue.<br />
<br />
What I have been doing untill now is to wait for someone to trap a beast, then I trap it again.<br />
I suppose that has been ruined now?<br />
<br />
Nope. You can still do that. You just have to group with that player first instead of randomly popping out of nowhere and throwing down a trap with or without their consent.<br />
<br />
I honestly never had any issue with people who would whisper me first and coordinate with me. Those people were not the problem. The problem people were the ones who would run up and throw down a trap as soon as they saw you throw yours down-- whether or not it went off. I had one too many where I was still trying to get the mob into the right position, and the other guy's trap caught but mine didn't. I also had a few who blatantly would taunt off of my traps, and I'm on a low-pop realm. I can't imagine the nightmare that people had on high-pop realms.<br />
<br />
Bonus: My main is a priest, so it's not like I'm a plate wearer who can easily facetime these elites. I have to kite and put a little bit of thought into it, so the fact that I had a lot of pet and tanking classes attempting to have ME of all people do all the hard work for them would be hilarious if it wasn't so darn rage-inducing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well-designed, finely tuned you haven't been taking those crazy pills again have you? I can't even read this statement with a straight face &quot;finely tuned&quot; are you mad? Only a handful of heroes are useful and the rest you might as well shove under carpet it would of served better by increasing the ban list or add a rotation where certain heroes are not allowed to be used in certain periods. &quot;well designed&quot;? Sure if you like playing the same endless game over and over again, you only have 5 roles and they are set, which is just silly over a large map compared to dota where you can play a different team set up, it's just really not viable over LOL where if you ingore one aspect your whole game just suffers. Saying LOL is hardcore and believing him is just silly, for god sakes they added so many limits and changes the game is a mess compared what it was when it first started the only saving grace is Riot keeps on pumping money into it by adding more &quot;anime&quot; like skins and drawings of well-endowed ladies and people keep on snapping it up. Until the fad passes it's here to stay similar to another game called &quot;Vs. System&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
How is LoL not for hardcore players (no matter if he said it or not)? You need many games (300+?) to get to lvl30 and even after that, many people probably play 1000+ games. Your perceived difficulty doesn't have anything to do with it (which I assume is your point).<br />
<br />
If LOL is hardcore in terms of reaching level 30 and playing many games then yes but on competitive level, no. Watch the streams and every single game the first 15 or so minutes it's exactly the same. I admire those who put up with it but it seems more money driven to succeed more than enjoying the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
All hybrid classes bring these days is the ability to have one character switch roles on a fight by fight basis if an extra tank or healer is required. If they want hybrid dps specs to perform lower now, then they need to give them the big healing cd's back. A boomkin without Tranq offers no hybrid ability, and if the dps isn't competitive raids would have to consider not carrying one and swapping players when an extra healer is needed as opposed to having a player swap roles. DPS specs should all be relatively balanced that if they are played well, they are competitive. No reason warlocks should out perform paladins or boomkin. Pure dps classes should however be designed that different specs perform better on different fights so that AoE heavy vs Single Target fights will require high end players to consider switching specs on a fight by fight basis. They should not, by default, top the meters on every fight tho.</div></div><hr />

these and the return of dailys and flying can only save the entire xpac!<br />

No to flying. <br />
Yes to account wide garrisons.<br />

Flying it so wrong for this expansion, it would totally destroy all the landscape fun we have. You can have some real good pvp out there and terrain is part of it; that and goblin gliders<br />

Ah well, the days of ninja trapping (which I only ever did to the enemy faction) are over .. probably for the best.<br />
<br />
I think they did this more to stop multiple people getting credit for one kill than ninja trapping; which they needed to fix. Why isn't this fix for all traps?<br />
<br />
Best ninja trapping is killing the guy trapping at 51%</div></div><hr />

On top of that those specs should need different gear...and a completely different playstyle...so that our friendly pure dps classes finally realize that hybrids are not just &quot;hit a button...be a different specc&quot; jack of all trades for free.<br />

Doesn't make it right tho. The reason for Ulduar problems was not just that it was hard...but that it came in no time after Naxxramas with it's 15 bosses. Then it was gated behind that vehicle encounter(which was innovative...but should have been optional)...and Algalon(best looking loot) inaccessible for all but real hardcore guilds. So everyone that was not really hardcore was just at the limit with the 15 Naxx Bosses and not willing to cope with another 14 in Ulduar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What makes you think the changes are based on PvE? Considering the changes to most classes in the form of nerfs have historically always been based on PvP crybabies. Generally unless something is ridiculously game breaking there haven't been nerfs based solely on PvE. Think about it, they were perfectly fine with Warlocks doing 100-200k+ more dps than other in raids from 5.4 to 6.0. Perhaps the issue is that there isn't much gating in PvP, so the player in 610 iLvL PvE gear joins a Random Battleground and gets blown up by a player in full Glad gear, they are going to whine AND his whining is taken into consideration just as much as the others with legitimate concern. Why you ask? Because bad players come in droves and are generally louder due to this.</div></div><hr />

It also grants a bit of insight as to how Blizzard actually thinks now, vs how they want us to think they think.<br />
<br />
A couple of the comments he made which I thought were especially insightful. &quot;You almost find yourself trying to design somewhat shitty content,&quot; which I think a lot of players have asserted over the years (think collect 10 bear asses). <br />
<br />
And <br />
<br />
&quot;I still struggle with that question. Is it better to have a good experience for few classes or viability for all of them?&quot; Which again, I think a lot of players have raised this question over the years. Think talent system revamp, bring the player not the class, etc.</div></div><hr />

He may not be right, but his opinion is much more informed than yours could be, since he had access to the internal progression stats that would unambiguously say how difficult the WoW population found the instances, and how many did each of them.<br />
<br />
Indeed, the stats would say this so clearly that you're basically accusing him of lying, not of being mistaken.</div></div><hr />

I'm with you here, but I'm wondering ... <br />
<br />
I keep seeing people call for account wide garrisons, but how are they thinking they would work? Account-wide followers, and having the plans be account-wide I can understand, but what about other aspects? One mine, one herb garden ... both that yield a lot more? How much more? How do people think it would work for people that have, for example, one of each class and all professions covered?</div></div><hr />

Rets are fine.<br />
<br />
Are you basing your opinion on them should be nerfing on some LFR and Normal/Hero PUGS?<br />
<br />
See logs of mythic raiding, that's were the players skills are close enough to see the actual balance. Not some random pugs where the dps balance is unmeasureable because of the low skill and tons of mistakes there are.<br />
<br />
Rets have a great bursting phase (not even the best one though) but dps overall is not at all overpowered. Every game is balance arround behaviour among the top tier players, deal with it.</div></div><hr />
