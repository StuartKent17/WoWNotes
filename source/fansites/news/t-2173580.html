<br />
Seems quite a lot tbh when nighthold only has been out for 4-5 weeks.<br />
<br />
Surely tomb of Sargeras can't release until may-june, yet they're doing so much testing already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
remember how nighthold raid boss testing was done like 2 months before release of the expansion?<br />

They've said that because of how their updates are structured, Tomb bosses need to be in 7.2 files. That DOES NOT mean that Tomb is anywhere close to release.</div></div><hr />

Didn't they say that the 7.2 weapons would be for solo challenges or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess they haven't seen the Frost DK hidden appearance on female belfs. Those things are massive and look awful sheathed on the side. They look like they clip into each other.<br />
<br />
Why not just make an option to sheath weapons on the back or on the side?</div></div><hr />

We adjusted the scaling as little as possible in order to maintain the weapon fantasy the scaling provides (i.e. The human female still has large weapons, but now that those weapons are slightly scaled down her hand can ‘properly’ hold it better, the blood elf female's weapons should feel a bit more impactful now).<br />
<br />
Better late than never for the blood elf females!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already do. You can technically get them from killing rares, opening the world chests, and doing normal dungeons well before hitting 110. It's absurdly rare to get them from those sources, especially when you have no bad luck protection built up, but it has been possible since launch.<br />
<br />
Edit: I'm also pretty sure you can get from world bosses before 110.</div></div><hr />

It means that talent is broken and unpickable due to it not affecting it. So basically if you pick slice and dice you dont get a fourth golden trait and its 100% useless making this 4th golden trait broken and needing to be changed! Please hear me out on this blizzard! They need to add that golden trait baked into the spec buffing rtb then add a different one!</div></div><hr />
