Legion Class Preview Series: Death Knight<br />
Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion class preview series. In this entry, we’re exploring the Death Knight—to find out what’s in store for a different class, check out the overview. <br />
<br />
We continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Death Knight. In these blogs, we’ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion’s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization—laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let’s delve into what it means to be a Death Knight in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
The first new class introduced to World of Warcraft after its launch, Death Knights came into the fray with an identity unmistakably tied to the Wrath of the Lich King story. The Death Knights of Acherus, their cold bodies lifted from the grave in the Scarlet Enclave, were commanded by the Lich King and Highlord Darion Mograine to slaughter every villager in Tyr’s Hand, New Avalon, and Havenshire, and to sack Light’s Hope Chapel, decimating both the Scarlet Crusade and the Argent Dawn.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, as a result of such uncompromising ambition, the Lich King was betrayed by Highlord Mograine in an act that freed the Death Knights from their servitude. Under Mograine’s leadership they formed the Knights of the Ebon Blade and began joining the ranks of the Horde and Alliance forces bound for Icecrown Citadel to end the reign of Arthas, the Lich King. Though now free from the Lich King’s grasp, these once virtuous champions remain knights of darkness, wielding runeblades of death and destruction and mercilessly stealing the very life essence of their enemies.<br />
<br />
We always want to reflect the Death Knight origin story and identity in how they play. The biggest area where we see room for improvement is in their resource system. Runes are a very iconic resource, but their functionality has always been convoluted. In Legion, we’re making Runes more straightforward by removing their division into separate Blood, Frost, and Unholy types. Death Knights now have six unified Runes to spend, with a maximum of three recharging at any one time.<br />
<br />
With this change, it’s also important that we preserve the existing gameplay familiarity of Death Knights by making mostly minor changes to core ability functionality and cost—we don’t want the Rune change to create a situation where the best Frost rotation is just Obliterate, Obliterate, Obliterate. Finally, we’re reducing ability overlap between specializations, giving each a single disease with a unique trait and creating a talent tree that’s largely populated with spec-specific talents to better distinguish them.<br />
<br />
Blood[/b][/size][/center]<br />
In undeath, some death knights find a special affinity for the blood and bone of the living. They carve into their enemies, sustaining themselves with deadly sanguine strikes, while using the bloody, shattered remains of the dead to fortify their own defenses. These crimson-soaked knights bend the very rules of mortality to control the frontlines of the battlefield. <br />
<br />
&quot;These crimson-soaked knights bend the very rules of mortality to control the frontlines of the battlefield&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
The core abilities for Blood should be familiar, though we’ve touched them up to bring added clarity to the specialization. Each core ability now better leverages that sinister command of blood and bone to fuel your survivability. In particular, we’ve changed Death Strike to cost Runic Power instead of Runes. This results in a more clear choice of resource expenditure; you can’t lock yourself out of being able to heal if you spend a Rune at the wrong time, and also gives Runic Power generation a bigger impact.<br />
<br />
Instead of Rune Tap, we’re positioning Bone Shield to be the primary complement to Death Strike for active defenses to better tie into the fantasy and provide more flexibility. Marrowrend is a new attack which allows you to rotationally generate Bone Shields. To provide gameplay contention between Runes of a single type, Blood Strike now generates additional Runic Power on top of the standard amount gained for spending a Rune.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core defensive and offensive combat abilities for Blood Death Knights:<br />
<br />
Blood Strike<br />
<br />
1 Rune, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Instantly strike the enemy, causing moderate Physical damage and infecting the victim with Blood Plague.<br />
Generates 10 bonus Runic Power.<br />
Blood Plague<br />
<br />
A disease that deals minor Shadow damage and heals the caster for 1% of their maximum health every 3 sec for 30 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Marrowrend<br />
<br />
2 Runes, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Smash the target, dealing strong Physical damage and generating 3 charges of Bone Shield.<br />
Bone Shield<br />
<br />
Surrounds you with a barrier of whirling bones that reduces all damage you take by 25%. Each damaging attack consumes a charge. Lasts for 30 sec or until all charges are consumed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Strike<br />
<br />
40 Runic Power, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Focuses dark power into a strike that deals strong Physical damage and heals you for 50% of all damage taken in the last 6 sec (minimum 7% of maximum health).<br />
If you are below 35% health when this is cast, all Runic Power is consumed, increasing the potency of the healing effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Blood Shield<br />
<br />
Each time you heal yourself with Death Strike, you gain 40% (with Mastery from typical gear) of the base amount healed as a Physical damage absorption shield.<br />
Also increases your Attack Power by 20% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Death and Decay<br />
<br />
1 Rune, 30 yd range, Instant, 30 sec cooldown<br />
Corrupts the ground targeted by the Death Knight, causing moderate Shadow damage over 10 sec to targets within the area. While you remain within the targeted area, your Blood Strike will hit all nearby enemies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crimson Scourge<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your successful autoattacks on targets infected with your Blood Plague have a 25% chance to reset the cooldown on Death and Decay.<br />
<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this core rotation, here’s an example of a Blood-specific talent:<br />
<br />
Bonestorm<br />
<br />
15 Runic Power per sec, Instant, 1 min cooldown<br />
A whirl of bone and gore batters nearby enemies 3 times per second to deal minor Shadow damage, healing you for 1% of your maximum health per strike.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost[/b][/size][/center]<br />
Combining martial prowess with supernatural cold, frost death knights leave their enemies chilled to the bone—and broken of the will to fight. Unlike mages who learn to harness frost magic to great effect, these death knights are born of it, rime gripping their decaying hearts. These frozen undead warriors wield dual blades to strike with ferocity and inflict deathly cold upon anyone who would stand against them. <br />
<br />
&quot;These death knights are born of frost magic, rime gripping their decaying hearts&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
The mechanics of the Frost Death Knight are quite solid and we don’t want to do too much to change that. You’ll notice that the core combat abilities listed below are largely familiar. One small area where we found room for improvement, however, is in Killing Machine’s passive interaction with the core rotation. While the automatic critical strikes it provides feel good, it’s often better to ignore its proc in favor of spending resources as fast as you can, as your damage output suffers if you wait for the different resources required for using Obliterate and Frost Strike to become available. Killing Machine now only affects Obliterate, and making wise use of its effect should feel more meaningful.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Frost Death Knights:<br />
<br />
Howling Blast<br />
<br />
1 Rune, 30 yd range, Instant<br />
Blast a target with a frigid wind, dealing minor Frost damage to that target, and minor Frost damage to all other enemies within 10 yds, infecting all targets with Frost Fever<br />
Frost Fever<br />
<br />
A disease that deals minor Frost damage and has a chance to grant the Death Knight 5 Runic Power every 3 sec for 30sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Obliterate<br />
<br />
2 Runes, Melee Range, Instant<br />
A brutal attack with both weapons that deals massive Physical damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost Strike<br />
<br />
20 Runic Power, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Chill your weapons with icy power, and quickly strike the enemy with both weapons, dealing massive Frost damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rime<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your Obliterate has a 45% chance to cause your next Howling Blast to consume no Runes, generate no Runic Power, and deal 300% additional damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Killing Machine<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your autoattacks have a chance to make your next Obliterate automatically critically strike.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remorseless Winter<br />
<br />
1 Rune, Instant, 30 sec cooldown<br />
Radiate extreme cold, dealing moderate Frost damage to all enemies within 10 yards of you over 10 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Frozen Heart<br />
<br />
Increases all Frost damage done by 40% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this core rotation, here’s an example of a Frost-specific talent:<br />
<br />
Glacial Advance<br />
<br />
1 Rune, Instant, 12 sec cooldown<br />
Summon glacial spikes from the ground that advance forward, each dealing moderate Frost damage to enemies near their eruption point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unholy[/b][/size][/center]<br />
While free from the Lich King’s grasp, some death knights still embody the ever-corrupting nature of the Scourge plague that once threatened to consume Azeroth. No matter their allegiance or cause, they remain defilers of life; and nowhere is their callousness more on display than when threatened. Inflictors of the most aggressive of diseases—and masters of raising unhallowed minions from the ground—these unholy death knights are vicious melee combatants, capable of striking with the force of an undead legion and unleashing pestilence that would bring their foes to ruin. <br />
<br />
&quot;Unholy death knights are vicious melee combatants, capable of unleashing pestilence that would bring their foes to ruin&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Unholy is receiving slightly more mechanical changes than Blood and Frost, to better realign with their unique identity. We want to ensure that Unholy continues to be the spec with the most active use of diseases. In this regard, we recognize that Festering Strike lost its luster over time and have developed a new mechanic to ensure the ability remains integral in the Unholy rotation.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Unholy Death Knights:<br />
<br />
Outbreak<br />
<br />
1 Rune, 30 yd range, Instant, 6 sec cooldown<br />
Deals minor Shadow damage and surrounds the target in a miasma lasting for 6 sec that causes the target and all nearby enemies to be infected with Virulent Plague<br />
Virulent Plague<br />
<br />
A disease that deals moderate Shadow damage every 3 sec for 21 sec. It erupts when the infected target dies, dealing moderate Shadow damage, split evenly between nearby enemies.<br />
The disease also has a 30% chance to erupt each time it deals damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Festering Strike<br />
<br />
2 Runes, Melee Range, Instant<br />
Deals massive Physical damage and infects the target with 1 to 3 Festering Wounds.<br />
Festering Wound<br />
<br />
A pustule-ridden lesion that may be burst by Scourge Strike, dealing moderate Shadow damage and generating 3 Runic Power.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scourge Strike<br />
<br />
1 Rune, Melee Range, Instant<br />
An unholy strike that deals strong Physical damage and strong Shadow damage. Triggers a single stack of Festering Wound, if it is present on the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Coil<br />
<br />
30 Runic Power, 40 yd range, Instant<br />
Fires a blast of unholy energy at the target, causing strong Shadow damage to an enemy, and restoring 10 Energy to your Ghoul.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sudden Doom<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your autoattacks have a chance to make your next Death Coil cost no Runic Power.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dark Transformation<br />
<br />
Instant, 1 min cooldown<br />
Transform your Ghoul into a powerful undead monstrosity for 20 sec. The Ghoul’s abilities are empowered and take on new functions while the transformation is active.<br />
<br />
<br />
Death and Decay<br />
<br />
1 Rune, 30 yd range, Instant, 30 sec cooldown<br />
Corrupts the ground targeted by the Death Knight, causing moderate Shadow damage over 10 sec to targets within the area. While you remain within the targeted area, your Scourge Strike will hit all nearby enemies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Dreadblade<br />
<br />
Increases all Shadow damage done by 50% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
To give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this core rotation, here’s an example of an Unholy-specific talent:<br />
<br />
All Will Serve<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your Raise Dead spell summons an additional skeletal minion, and its cooldown is removed.<br />
<br />

Oblit will still always be stronger with increasing strength too. But I get what youre saying. I did prefer 2H anyway so I'm happy if it does follow that role</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes the player feel more powerful and a true master of their spec if they can summon and control more than one pet at a time. I'm pretty excited about the changes to Unholy, BM, and Demo. It'll be a nice change in pace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frost - Why just why didnt frost get any changes, it is a mindless 2 button spec, that had the only forms of thinking removed from it (dont overblast to cap UH runes, maintain a second dot) so now it will be absolutely the most boring spec to play across all 12 classes.<br />
<br />
UH - Why the fuck do we lose anything we like about UH, like OG gargoyle .. gone, like wandering plague ... gone, like breath of sindragosa pretty much garenteed gone with UH getting mechanics that give additional Runic power. Why are we shifting UH's focus from consistent dmg over time from dots to Cleave orientated when the only thing frost is any good for is cleave. Now we are stuck with 2 specs built for cleaving both of which suck at ST damage.<br />
<br />
Mastery - Flat dmg increases still (and likely a stat that all 3 specs will continue to stack) .... that is just lazy unholys mastery should be the shadow dmg bonus from scourge strike but applied to all dmg sources and frost's should be killing machine where mastery increases the rate at which KM procs and the Crit Damage bonus from KM.<br />
<br />
Obliterate/Festering Strike - Why do these still do 100% physical damage these are signature moves of a class that stacks a stat that doesnt even effect them, atleast make them partial spell damage or we will just have the same issues at the end of tier where dks dont scale well.<br />
<br />
Honestly i thought skullflower joining the DK team was a blessing, but this is the worst iteration of dk to come.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkwarrior42</div><div class="date">2015-11-10, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hate to see that they still have no plan for changing obliterate into frost damage.

<br />
I'm not exactly a master of the death knight, but based on the previews we've seen so far I would guess that there will be a talent that modifies Obliterate in some way... making it do frost damage, or changing a portion of it to frost damage or some such. If it's in a row with other strong options, that *might* open up some gearing options. Go with the frost-based obliterate for a mastery-heavy build, or go with this other talent for a more crit or haste heavy build. <br />
<br />
One idea that comes to mind is to copy Chaos Bolt's functionality for a competitive talent.... you have one talent to make obliterate do frost damage and scale with mastery, and another that increases its damage by your critical strike chance when used in combination with killing machine. (Edit: For example, &quot;Annihilate: While Killing Machine is active, your critical strike chance increases the damage of your next Obliterate.&quot;<br />
<br />
*shrug* I have no idea what they're actually going to do, but given the nature of some of the talents we've seen and heard about (for example: frost mages are getting a talent to remove the icicles passive and replace it with something else, which obviously will have huge ramifications for their mastery), I wouldn't be surprised to see options or tweaks like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frost - Why just why didnt frost get any changes, it is a mindless 2 button spec, that had the only forms of thinking removed from it (dont overblast to cap UH runes, maintain a second dot) so now it will be absolutely the most boring spec to play across all 12 classes.<br />
<br />
UH - Why the fuck do we lose anything we like about UH, like OG gargoyle .. gone, like wandering plague ... gone, like breath of sindragosa pretty much garenteed gone with UH getting mechanics that give additional Runic power. Why are we shifting UH's focus from consistent dmg over time from dots to Cleave orientated when the only thing frost is any good for is cleave. Now we are stuck with 2 specs built for cleaving both of which suck at ST damage.<br />
<br />
Mastery - Flat dmg increases still (and likely a stat that all 3 specs will continue to stack) .... that is just lazy unholys mastery should be the shadow dmg bonus from scourge strike but applied to all dmg sources and frost's should be killing machine where mastery increases the rate at which KM procs and the Crit Damage bonus from KM.<br />
<br />
Obliterate/Festering Strike - Why do these still do 100% physical damage these are signature moves of a class that stacks a stat that doesnt even effect them, atleast make them partial spell damage or we will just have the same issues at the end of tier where dks dont scale well.<br />
<br />
Honestly i thought skullflower joining the DK team was a blessing, but this is the worst iteration of dk to come.<br />
<br />
You should really rethink how you are playing Frost if you think it is &quot;smash 2 buttoms&quot; rotation. Frost is a easy to play, hard to master spec. The changes are pretty solid in almost all aspects, and the only thing that really bothered me was the fact Obliterate will still be Physical Damage instead of Frost. About unholy, they stated in the description that they like the desease mechanics and will improve on it, at the same time that will increase the focus on summoning ghouls and other minions. This aligns much more with the classic DK lore, where they are masters of undeath. <br />

And there best be a talent to lower the RP cost to like 30 RP instead of 40. 40 is a bit overkill.<br />
<br />
Ignoring the paladin update preview, it makes DK AM a bit more like the other tanks. Paladins with HP, Warriors and Druids with rage, monks with chi. It's all build resource then use AM. DKs were kind of the opposite by using AM then get RP. I'd say it makes it more uniform where your primary AM ability is the finisher. Where it gets confusing is the paladin changes where AM is being changed to a system that is basically passive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interestingly, there is no mention of Blood Boil for Blood spec. studying the interaction between Blood Strike, Death &amp; Decay and Crimson Scourge (Passive) ,it looks like the Blood Death Knight will no longer require Blood Boil in its toolkit! If this turns out to be true then I'll be happy, I dislike that spell, its poor animation and annoying sound.<br />

I always liked playing my unholy death knight but I might try another class this time, the rune system really was what made it for me and I don't like it being removed<br />
actually the fact that they removed rune types will make the class harder to play, you will no longer be stuck in the waiting for a specific rune to recharge. It also adds a fuckload of burst potential in PvP.</div></div><hr />

Only BM Hunters and Demo Warlocks and now Unholy DKs can summon more than one pet. Everyone else either summon no pet or summon on. And those 3 are SPECs and not classes so the amount is a lot less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blood seems to be losing their &quot;work on what is happening&quot; element. We used to heal ourselves right when we were in risk, but now the bones stuff makes us just like all the other tanks, and our survivality + damage is gone, don't know how they plan us to level as tanks if it is pure defensive thinking now (Not just DK). I understand the use of Runic power was just about Death Coil as blood, but moving our main healing ability to Runic Power is plain stupid. <br />
<br />
Frost seems fine for me, I actually like the changes. Except pure 2H only (I'm expecting them to allow 1H Frost though)<br />
<br />
Unholy is now pure luck damage even though the changes will make them a little more relevant, as they were dead (literally), they should let us have control of the damage and not just expect for &quot;chances&quot; to increase the damage sometimes.</div></div><hr />

Blood Plague<br />
A disease that deals minor Shadow damage and heals the caster for 1% of their maximum health every 3 sec for 30 sec.<br />

Death and Decay<br />
1 Rune, 30 yd range, Instant, 30 sec cooldown<br />
Corrupts the ground targeted by the Death Knight, causing moderate Shadow damage over 10 sec to targets within the area. While you remain within the targeted area, your Blood Strike will hit all nearby enemies.<br />

Relax amigo, was more a reply to javierdsv. :)<br />
<br />
Blood is going to still be quite active, but less about multiple resources (blood tap, rp, rune management, DS stacks, did I miss any?) and more about reacting/preparing for damage and responding to procs. I agree that prot sounds more interesting, but Blood even as-is on live feels good, just...blood boil spam sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think, like many the new DK is good but ultimately nothing has really changed....<br />
<br />
They should of either cut it down to 2 specs or had the 3rd specs do something entirely different, they also missed something they done in ASHRAN with the 2 Death Knights which would of being a delight to play in Legion<br />
<br />
The Dwarf Death Knight Captain with 4 runic weapons instead of ghouls and the Blood Elf Death Knight Captain with 4 Ghouls.<br />
<br />
They could of had Blood or renamed it Runic and instead of summoning ghouls summon runic weapons and made it more of an defensive spec, can still tank by swapping out weapons or presence but made it more of defensive spec and use blood type of abilities to restore health<br />
<br />
And made a proper Frost spec which summons corpses on death and made it more of an offensive spec and do the exact same thing with blood, sometimes I think to change it up having a couple of specs that could tank just by swapping presence is just fine, DKs and Warriors are both designed that in mind and sometimes I wonder why they devote an whole spec to it.<br />
<br />
Maybe made the third spec into a summoner, melee caster hybrid where you have a pet and do damage at range or something as the new one, cause Unholy and Frost are too similar, be the antithesis of paladin the closer you are to the DK and the pet the more damage he does to you. Same like how the closer you are to the beacon and Paladin the more he heals you.</div></div><hr />

They need to make more ranged minions, or minions that sit at your side and don't leave your aggro range. <br />

Since dual spec, there was actually no reason to worry about leveling as a tank or healer. Never understood why they wanted to keep giving more dmg for both to &quot;help leveling&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now with &quot;all specs&quot; in Legion, no reason at all. Just swtich to any other dps spec avaiable for your class and go crazy on leveling.<br />

Absolutely Garbage - Definantly benching my DK for legion<br />

Frost - Why just why didnt frost get any changes, it is a mindless 2 button spec, that had the only forms of thinking removed from it (dont overblast to cap UH runes, maintain a second dot) so now it will be absolutely the most boring spec to play across all 12 classes.<br />

Obliterate/Festering Strike - Why do these still do 100% physical damage these are signature moves of a class that stacks a stat that doesnt even effect them, atleast make them partial spell damage or we will just have the same issues at the end of tier where dks dont scale well.<br />

Oh, nice that you're alread playing Legion and know everything, because for us, they're just showing examples, specially for talents. There should be many more spells/talents in the build you're &quot;playing&quot;, check again...<br />

You should really rethink how you are playing Frost if you think it is &quot;smash 2 buttoms&quot; rotation. Frost is a easy to play, hard to master spec. The changes are pretty solid in almost all aspects, and the only thing that really bothered me was the fact Obliterate will still be Physical Damage instead of Frost.

<br />
In my opinion, this is one of the best iterations of the DK class, and can't wait to see how the changes in runes and rotation will impact on gameplay.<br />
<br />
Wait and see, because since we don't have the 2H frost option anymore, and that was the one needing the frost dmg on obliterate, maybe it won't matter anymore as it doesn't right now for DW frost. Also the increase of sources for frost dmg (+300% dmg from Rime, Remorseless Winter doing frost dmg, etc.) probably made them play safe on this one.</div></div><hr />

Probably that we have no idea if blood boil still exists or not. It could still be an ability, it could be on talent tree, or it could be in artifact talents.

<br />
&quot;Baseline classes in Legion lean a little simpler, so that we can add a wide array of complexity via talents.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now untwist your virtual panties, peeps, and wait for more info before going all apoplectic.<br />
Ask warriors in WoD how that feels. It's awful. It was a horrible design decision for Arms in WoD and if it's leaking into the other classes, then people should be MORE freaked out, not less. They proved they have no idea how to design talents that create meaningful impact and choices with regard to your rotation. In general, it's just a bad design. The baseline should be solid and enjoyable, with talents and such to expand upon it - not a dull/boring/lifeless baseline with talents that make it playable. Seriously, if this is the direction they are taking all classes, then I will continue to be done with the game.</div></div><hr />

Welp, guess we're gonna have to agree to disagree there. For one, I'm withholding judgment until we see how all of the talents in the new trees and artifacts look. Secondly, I'd much prefer a base core rotation that allows for tons of customization within a spec than the cookie-cutter bullshit we have now. While that does depend heavily on whether the devs actually accomplish this, and while I understand the past causing concerns for the future, I think it's absurd and entirely irrational to make your type of judgment this early, with this little bit of info.<br />
<br />
Again, I'll make this point: If you look at your current &quot;core abilities&quot; in the spec tabs, there's a whopping four of them. If you judged a spec's rotation based on those alone, would that be sensible or a fair representation of the spec?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc5d4899ea1f</div><div class="date">2015-11-10, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, I like all of that as and UHDK. Frost doesnt seem any different. <br />
<br />
what im interested in is how the Festering wound will play out with festering strike. Is it just a chance of getting 1 to 3 stacks per hit or can it stack to 3 with 3 x festering? For those of us playing current plagueblight or BoS set up dont think it will affect too badly apart from the spreading of disease stacks other than the initial outbreak cd. I guess maybe the use of D&amp;D will make up for that and possibly the Disease part of UHDK's may take a back seat to physical dmg. <br />
<br />
Seems like they are doing away with building up runic to spam DC's to pop DT asap in the fight with the 1min CD on it instead which could be win win if they are keeping BoS as you could literally cap runic and keep BoS up for a pretty long time if not a whole duration of a fight. Surely that cant be right? Super OP &amp; Guaranteed nerfs if that is teh case. <br />
<br />
We need to see talent tree's and full abilities I guess before making too strong conclusions but from what ive read seems intersting without a major overhaul so im reasonably happy!</div></div><hr />

You have to understand, for Arms, those four abilities ARE the rotation. That's what I'm talking about here. I've seen how this design concept has quickly accelerated what was a much loved spec into the worst spec in the entire game. Perhaps the devs have learned from that, we'll find out tomorrow when they preview warriors. I'm worried that they think it was successful and plan on expanding it to the other specs in the game. That would keep me from ever coming back - that's all I'm saying. I'm not optimistic, but I'm not overly pessimistic either. I'm reserving judgment until beta and we get a look at these classes/specs actually functioning in game. But until then, I'm also not going to assume everything will be ok; the devs have burned that bridge one time too many for me to do so.</div></div><hr />

That is ... sad. I know nothing of warriors, so I can't comment anymore than that.<br />

Yep, that's entirely fair. Although I will say this ... don't expect the warrior preview to make you feel any better. The previews, as you may have gathered, are too limited in what they reveal (but here's to praying there's FAR more on the table or we're fucked lol).</div></div><hr />

Oh I know. If nothing else, just hoping it will show that they have recognized the flaws with Arms and are working to improve it. But enough of me derailing this with warrior talk - back to DKs!</div></div><hr />

We have the right to overreact with the way they have done the playerbase in WoD. Esp if you are an arms war lol. And now being a 2h frost dk myself im pretty pissed</div></div><hr />

More pets and &quot;wounds&quot; aren't of any interest to me, especially when they're taking away interesting runes and traditional disease variety just because.</div></div><hr />

I like = 2 pets seems cool<br />
Not sure about = the Dark Transformation changes. The only 1 rune type thing. <br />
It feels like all the classes in Legion has to be ALOT easier to play with, maybe for new players or children? But it's a preview and I haven't played with any of the changes so, show us what you got blizz ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but here's the thing.<br />
<br />
They're giving warriors 5 tiers of throughput, nearly-entirely spec-specific, talent choices. Many of which will be new, or familiar. Will it take a lot of tweaking/balance? Yeah. But it'll be great, and give people some real choice over their characters.<br />
<br />
But go on assuming that WoD is the blueprint for Legion. (spoiler: Legion seems to be a significant departure)<br />

They don't say anywhere that it will only be one disease.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NeoSKakrott</div><div class="date">2015-11-11, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I've been on a DK since WotLK dropped. I've enjoyed them throughout he good and the bad, I was sad to see my Blood DPS go away, I got some good laughs out of HB spamming 40 Man BGs. All in all though I think the best balance they had in terms of fun, challenge, and balance was during Cata for the first two raid tiers, those arena seasons were fun too. I think that was when they had them tuned best. They weren't miles ahead of everyone on the DPS charts and they weren't left trailing behind everyone, the RNG proc reaction made Frost feel pretty fun to play during raids. Reactionary Tanking was what always made Blood enjoyable to me as my off spec. I really liked the idea of being more in control of my survivability than solely relying on the healers and not having to worry about procs to save me. Unholy is something I've never really been able to get invested or interested in simply because it just never really seemed too appealing outside of big ghoul and corpse explosions.<br />
<br />
On the topic of spec design I'm really fond of the idea of the Unholy becoming the antithesis of the Holy Pally, I like the idea of them being a mid-ranged combatant who slings diseases and curses as well as summons ghouls and undead, preferably several smaller ones at once almost like a watered down version of always running AotD. And maybe give them several different disease types to choose from. Maybe something dealing shadow, something dealing frost, something the slows, something that reduces armor, something that does something I am not thinking about, maybe unholy's aura gives a boost to arcane magic users or dampens enemy holy magic. I'm kind of seeing something there that lands between lock DoTs and Hunter traps/shots. Give it a little versatility though. Maybe have all their spells cast from their rune blade? That could make for some interesting animation. I say build them out to exist in that space under that concept at least in a test phase and see how it feels. I think doing this could help give them a better sense of identity and a relevance in end game gameplay PvE or PVP. <br />
<br />
Also they can set the skin for them and the Holy Pallys to be the tier gear that's stuck in the dress, they are essentially battle clerics and battle necromancers at that point. Leave the Prot and Ret Paladins and the Blood and Frost DKs in their full leg armor. It doesn't really make sense to have a Tank or MDPs running around in a long dress, it would get in the way. Along those lines, I say shift the Unholy DK and Holy Pally to Mail armor. They make more sense as mail wearers than as full blown plate. And unless the Demon Hunter is going to be a Mail wearer this would do a little spreading of the love for who rolls on what. This could be a whole can of worm situation though. Just a thought.<br />
<br />
Oh here's a scary idea to bring up with class changes, how long until blizzard decides to open up the game to cross classing? Ugh... A Gnome Frost Mage / Brewmaster Monk. Now that's how we completely eff the game up right there. Let's throw that idea around the dev cooler and see what happens.</div></div><hr />
