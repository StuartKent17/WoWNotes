Legendary Items and Upgrades<br />

Collect 50 x Wakening Essence (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1533-wakening-essence) for A Titanic Effort (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/49473-a-titanic-effort)<br />
This quest rewards 1 x Awoken Titan Essence (http://www.wowdb.com/items/154879-awoken-titan-essence), which upgrades a Legion legendary item from any item level to item level 1000. <br />
In addition to all of the regular sources of Wakening Essence (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1533-wakening-essence), The Cursed Shard (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/49474-the-cursed-shard) rewards 10 x Wakening Essence (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1533-wakening-essence)<br />
Insignia of the Grand Army (http://www.wowdb.com/items/152626-insignia-of-the-grand-army) is a new legendary item that is rewarded from The Death of a Titan (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/49015-the-death-of-a-titan) (clearing Antorus). <br />
Aman'Thul's Vision (http://www.wowdb.com/items/154172-amanthuls-vision) is a new legendary item that is dropped by Argus. It does not count towards the legendary item equip cap. <br />

Nope, that was a Patch 7.3.5 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7151-Patch-7-3-5-Features-Stormwind-and-Orgrimmar-in-BfA-Dev-Interviews-Contest-Winners) feature.</div></div><hr />

You should be fine, after Nighthold these type of tokens were chaned to currency, so that you could collect them without the quest in your log. So you can start collecting without getting the quest, unless they mess that up a bit for a few hours like last time, I know a few people got screwed, then it got changed. Also. Taking the time to turn in your 3 emissaries, opening your mythic weekly and that one-time quest giving you 10 currency could be enough to upgrade your first lego before you even step in.</div></div><hr />

Nope. 7.3.5 are some 8.0 systems and small bits of content like a preview version of the new BG. Which is why that patch hasn't even hit the PTR yet.</div></div><hr />

Totally misunderstood that. Was really looking forward to level scaling sooner than later. Ion made it sound at Blizzcon like 7.3.5 wouldn't be too long of a wait. Do we have an opinion of when it might come out?</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping I'll be fine just going in. We don't have time for any of the things you mentioned. When I said the moment the raid opens, I mean literally the moment it opens we're zoning in and starting. We do a straight through normal clear as soon as servers come up. Its been something my guild has done for each raid release this expansion. Its kind of a tradition before all our raid teams break off to do their heroic clears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since source is complete unrelated to most legendaries, we can safely bet that it won't reset BLP. Just like your BLP don't reset when you equip crafted legendary.</div></div><hr />

Last time without quest you got nothing. So pick them at least once.</div></div><hr />

What? Amanthul's Vision is a trinket for every class/spec. It's proc changes to whatever class/spec has it equipped. The tooltip here just shows the int dmg proc.</div></div><hr />

I suspect given the content of the cinematics, the 7.3.5 PTR was being held until the Antorus release. I'd expect to see the 7.3.5 PTR within 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />
