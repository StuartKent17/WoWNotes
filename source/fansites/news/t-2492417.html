Duh - exploits tend to be. Having a lower level character turn off XP in order to boost you to a higher level isn’t how levelling is intended, thus its an exploit. Using a game mechanic in a way that it’s not intended is an exploit, like it or lump it.</div></div><hr />

No, it isn't, but you people will never see it in anything but that way.<br />

BTW, this same thing existed ALL of legion but Blizz didn't give two shits about it then, suddenly the xpac is failing and they do this. If it was such an exploit they would have fixed it THEN not now.</div></div><hr />

It is penalising and warning the wrong people.<br />
<br />
What should happen is that a XP locked character SHOULD gain experience (after a warning) in current (inc TW) PVE content.<br />
<br />
Other characters should not suffer any ramifications from a player locking XP.</div></div><hr />

The sad thing is that ppl used this for levelling 110-120, and paid level boost is only lvl 110, so its not even what you wrote...<br />

Its just exactly as someone else here said.<br />

Let’s copy and paste the meaning from Wikipedoa shall we, so at least it’s easy to understand:<br />
<br />
“In video games, an exploit is the use of a bug or glitches, game system, rates, hit boxes, speed or level design etc. by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers.”<br />
<br />
Levelling in this way isn’t how the developers intended, hence it’s an exploit. If they didn’t mind they wouldn’t have implemented this change, but they have. It’s an exploit to the levelling system and they changed it. Banging on about them not doing anything during Legion is pointless because this isn’t Legion, so whoever’s decision to not change anything then has either changed their mind on the matter or the person in that role has changed and has a different view. Regardless, levelling system exploit got changed, the end.</div></div><hr />

No it isn't, in blizzard terms an exploit leads to an unfair advantage, this does not. This is just a clever use of game mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Questing means playing BFA, which is a torture, there's a reason why leveling boost demand is so high.<br />
<br />
Probably during a dev meeting at Blizzard HQ, they found out the forecast said they wont make the quarterly participation quota, so its either the playerbase must play more, or they lose their job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It’s by definition an exploit, so that point isn’t even debatable - the developers didn’t intend for people to level this way, which is why it’s an exploit. Using other mechanics to essentially avoid levelling through the intended content with the use of a lower level may be a clever discovery, but it’s still an exploit (due to the above). That’s just facts, because that’s what an exploit is (as is the definition of an exploit). <br />

All I see here is a bunch of people whining because a game most people claim is too easy removed an exploit that made a fundamental part of the game easier to bypass. Be salty I guess, but it won’t do you any good.</div></div><hr />

Technically correct, but beside the point here.<br />
<br />
The question isn't &quot;was this counter to what the developers intended&quot; - that's the case by definition, because they're removing it.<br />
<br />
The question is, &quot;SHOULD this be counter to what the developers intended&quot;, i.e. should the devs change their mind on their intention.<br />
<br />
Personally, I see no reason why twinked-out 110s shouldn't be able to boost others. It takes investment and effort, and clever use of game mechanics. It doesn't cut into Blizz's profits because the purchasable boosts only go to 110 anyway, and this is 110-120. And it spares people rolling alt #10 from doing the SAME QUESTS in the SAME ZONES all over again for the 10th time.<br />
<br />
I don't really see the upside of disallowing this. In fact, if they aren't careful with how this interacts with groups (especially LFD), there may be a substantial DOWNSIDE from people trolling leveling characters.</div></div><hr />

What YOU call an exploit, is a massive failure of Blizzard to properly scale character power from Legion to BfA. Introducing Legendaries with overpowered traits (and ilvl till lvl115), the ilvl squish, the diminishing of ratings (mastery, haste etc), all of these (and possibly more) were conscious gameplay decisions of the Blizzard devs and result in lvl111 characters being stronger for dungeon content for higher level players. Players get weaker the closer they get to 120.<br />
<br />
Exploits, usually, tend to get fixed quite fast. The upgraded power characters and boosting exist for almost a year. It's not fixing an exploit, but more than a deliberate decision to force players into spending more time in the game THE DEVS have built with an inherent power scaling flaw. And instead of fixing the flaw, they now &quot;punish&quot; the players who used the &quot;flawed&quot; game design to their advantage. Also, highly hypocritical, since the game is designed for endgame mostly, with levelling being diminished to a boring chore.<br />

Within their game they do. They also don't adhere to alpha or beta test definitions. Definitions themselves aren't set in stone either, they're fluid and change all the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When Blizzard leaves such an &quot;exploit&quot; active for almost 9 months in the game and instead of HOTFIXING IT, they await a major patch to &quot;fix&quot; (which is not fixing the problem itself, but creating disadvantages for players using the intended game mechanics) it, they definitely seem like having a change of heart. It almost looks like they intended the game to ship like that and within 9 months they decided differently, thus changing it as mentioned. <br />
<br />
Your logic is flawed, because, if every patch corrects various stuff, then i guess all players are exploiters, since they were allowed to play the game as initially intended, but because the developer intentions changed at a later time, game mechanics change as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They haven’t really said so, and they don’t need to - it’s an exploit because it’s not how they designed the 110-120 levelling experience (clearly). It’s not even like it’s a 120 doing the boosting, but a lower level with XP gain turned off. Sure, it’s not the biggest game breaking exploit, but it’s definitely something that wasn’t intended to be used in such a manner. Realistically it’s their game, they can do and fix exploits how they please.<br />

<br />
When Blizzard leaves such an &quot;exploit&quot; active for almost 9 months in the game and instead of HOTFIXING IT, they await a major patch to &quot;fix&quot; (which is not fixing the problem itself, but creating disadvantages for players using the intended game mechanics) it, they definitely seem like having a change of heart. It almost looks like they intended the game to ship like that and within 9 months they decided differently, thus changing it as mentioned. <br />
<br />
Your logic is flawed, because, if every patch corrects various stuff, then i guess all players are exploiters, since they were allowed to play the game as initially intended, but because the developer intentions changed at a later time, game mechanics change as well.<br />
<br />
It’s not flawed, because who knows what decision making has gone into it. Who knows when they even picked up on it? I wasn’t fully aware of it from the start, as I’m sure a lot of people haven’t been. Regardless, it’s clear that’s not how they designed the 110-120 levelling process to work. So good.</div></div><hr />

I can understand why they put limitations on things like engineering gadgets (even though I hate it with my whole being).

<br />
I don't think so. It is rather an effect for those who choose the levelstop. A character at 120 doesn't choose to no longer gain experience, the game simply doesn't allow him to. I think it is for those who actively choose to stop at certain level and are playing with someone who still wants to get Levels. Like a level 60 levelstop group having taking someone at level 60 with them who doesn't use the levelstop.</div></div><hr />

Hey blizzard. Seeing as you want to control everything how about in the next expansion you just do everything for us automatically? Level gain, dungeons, raids.

<br />
It's using another mechanic to essentially make the levelling process quicker than it should be, that's an exploit - primarily due to the fact that's not how 110-120 was designed. There's no way having a level 110 with XP turned off gets another character to 120 in 2 hours or so was designed that way, clearly not. The fact they've implemented this buff/fix shows that.<br />
<br />
<br />
What YOU call an exploit, i call deliberate game design decision from Blizzard. THEY chose to have the power scaling mechanism at the start of BfA. Now, again, who's got the right definition?<br />
<br />
It's what the definition of a video game exploit calls it, not me. They have been aware of it since the beginning of BfA and did come up with a solution, but later abandoned the fix in order to seek out another way of dealing with it. In December they were going to prevent anybody 110 and above from disabling XP gain, but that affected more than the people actually using this exploit. They've found a solution now and they're using it, so i'm unsure why it's also a big of a shock to some when something was going to be done about it last December (https://www.wowhead.com/news=289308.2/upcoming-hotfix-to-prevent-level-110-players-from-turning-off-xp-gains-update). It's not like it's something that's just appeared out of no where.</div></div><hr />

Blizz's failure with scaling doesn't make it an exploit, or should all the Server First LK25H kills be revoked after Cata's launch, since the green gear at level 80 was already 10-15ilvl higher than ICC gear (at the time)? How about a level 10 with hierlooms being vastly stronger than a level 50, just due to the scaling factor, even though they can technically compete in the same content now with the revamped zones? Boosting has always been a thing, but before a max level character would do the boosting because they out-scaled/levelled the content, so they could clear it quickly; now it's just flipped, where the lower levels are more equipped with better itemization/abilities/legendaries to clear the content more effectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those two things are not the same. You're looking at ease and comparing it to time. Leveling is not difficult but it is time consuming. When there's no challenge, for some people it becomes a lot less interesting. So they want to get it over with as quickly as they can because it's simply not content they enjoy. They want to get their alts to max level so they can start doing the content they do enjoy. If they can do it in an optimal amount of time, why wouldn't they do it?<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone would say they expected leveling to only take a few hours, they were just happy it was there as an option. After you've done it on a few characters it becomes very tedious, especially since there's only 3 zones to level in BFA. Of course some people will look for shortcuts whenever they can.</div></div><hr />

It is, because it clearly wasn't designed to work that way. See below.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Boosting via dungeons has been in the game since launch, boosting others is not an exploit, even if the way you do it in 2019 is slightly different from 2005.<br />
<br />
It's not about boosting generally, it's about the fact a lower level character can turn off XP and boost your character to from 110-120 within 2 hours. That's not intended, that's an exploit. Boosting has been a higher level character running you through dungeons or content and making it quicker and that's fine - it's fxcked when it works the other way around though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I keep seeing that drivel being brought up over and over in this thread, but no statement from blizzard saying they consider it an exploit. Obviously, they intend to curtail the practice, but boosting in dungeons has been in the game literally since day 1. The methods aren't really different either, it's utilizing an overpowered character to clear a dungeon as fast as possible; if it was faster to clear a dungeon as a 120 they would use a 120, but it's not.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biomega</div><div class="date">2019-06-17, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is, because it clearly wasn't designed to work that way. See below.<br />
I'm not sure how you quoted me without reading the rest of what I've said.<br />
<br />
You could fill books with things that weren't designed the way some people are doing them, and yet Blizzard doesn't care, never has cared, likely never will care about a majority of them.<br />
<br />
So just saying &quot;but it wasn't designed that way&quot; is clearly NOT an argument ON ITS OWN, because there's a hundred examples of things that are never going to get fixed; yet this one is. So, while intent may be PART of the reason, the MAIN reason must be that there's something else this is impacting in a negative way that's severe enough to warrant a fix. And I'd like to know what, exactly.</div></div><hr />

Its shite, its boring, it has no general meaning anymore. at this point you have it in the game to make us spend more time playing or boost a character(bet blizz prefers this). <br />
<br />
Blizzard is so hell bendt on making alot of big stories in the game, but forget the horrid story new players will experience when leveling. How many warchiefs does a horde player have in his leveling? <br />

Obviously, they intend to curtail the practice, but boosting in dungeons has been in the game literally since day 1. The methods aren't really different either, it's utilizing an overpowered character to clear a dungeon as fast as possible; if it was faster to clear a dungeon as a 120 they would use a 120, but it's not.<br />
<br />
You may think it's drivel, but it's still facts. It's a fundamental part of the game, to the point where they want people to quest and explore to even unlock one part of flying. People basically skipping that within 2 hours from a lower level character is clearly not intended, so it's pointless trying to even make out like it is or that it's not a major problem. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how you quoted me without reading the rest of what I've said.<br />
<br />
You could fill books with things that weren't designed the way some people are doing them, and yet Blizzard doesn't care, never has cared, likely never will care about a majority of them.<br />
<br />
So just saying &quot;but it wasn't designed that way&quot; is clearly NOT an argument ON ITS OWN, because there's a hundred examples of things that are never going to get fixed; yet this one is. So, while intent may be PART of the reason, the MAIN reason must be that there's something else this is impacting in a negative way that's severe enough to warrant a fix. And I'd like to know what, exactly.<br />
<br />
I did read the rest, it just wasn't worth responding to because the basis of it still stands despite how much people try and rationalise it. It's clearly not intended to work that way, but people will get salty about anything. It's cute trying to see people trying to justify it honestly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Evidently they don't want people to boost, no but stop calling it an exploit its an asinine point because it's not. On every mechanical layer involved in this boosting method is an intended effect, as in level 110s get more out of their stats, they can use legendaries until 115, etcetera none of these things are unintended or exploitative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dungeons give exp by clearing them<br />
Thats a game design<br />
<br />
To clear dungeon you have to kill mobs and thrash<br />
Thats a game design<br />
<br />
If you decide to spot getting exp by game tool<br />
Thats a game design<br />
<br />
What do 110 lvls do? <br />
<br />
1) They kill mobs - Thats a game design<br />
2) Do they recive exp? - No, they stop getting it by they chose which is a game design<br />
<br />
Your logic is broken.<br />
<br />
It woud've been debatable if mobs were 120 and 110 woud've killed them easy and every class coud've do it. But there is a specific class with specific legion legendaries that can do this. Thats not and exploit since it didnt break any game design rules. They do dungeons, they kill mobs they dont get exp since they locked it. As simple as that</div></div><hr />

I don't think people who work on WoW are the problem. They can still generate good ideas but problem is that they are controlled by retards who have no idea how gaming works and they only want to see higher numbers of money made. As long as these people have influence, game will suck and will be behind time gated content. They have exact metrics for how much time it needs to pass for people to resub more so they adjust content to it.<br />

Do people need to do that? I can level to 120 by just doing all quests in a zone, the war campaign and maybe a dungeon or two (or a few quests from a second zone)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just saying. This would solve the boosts. At level 120 a debuff would be applied to the char that gradually the legendaries would lose their power until they stop working. <br />
<br />
For example: in the first 10 hours at level 120, the Legion legendary system would lose 10% of their power by each played hour. After 10 played hours at level 120, all legion legendaries wouldn't work anymore.</div></div><hr />

Properly? The devs solved the boring leveling by making each zone level synched to a degree and make sure you only experience half the expansions on any given character. There is no proper way. It's just a mad race to the end game that you only stop when you are on your favorite continent.</div></div><hr />

Content was always gated, since.... day one of wow.<br />
Current: Ok, we will release raid 2 weeks after patch, LFR wing coming out 3 weeks later. Quests added/opened in patch cycle.<br />
Back In a day: Ok, so you can't enter this dungeons until you have X, Y and Z. <br />

Second one has way more RP charge in it, but still is a time sink. TBC had time gates/daily quests, WotLK had time gates, daily quests/limited attempts even. The best expansions ever u know? Not even talking Mists of the Zone where all you do are daily quests.</div></div><hr />

When I'm levelling and do a dungeon I occasionally get a 'free boost' and it's fine.<br />
<br />
Again, like most of the posters here, it's like Blizzard are forcing you to quest. I'm slowly working on getting all classes to 120 and, after 2*120s and a handful of 111-119s in central Kul'tiras, I'm already a bit bored of the three zones and questlines. While I won't pay for a boost, I expect I'll dungeon spam my lowly tank/healers.<br />
<br />
What about boosts in raids? How will they target that? Same thing to me. People pay gold for in-game services/rewards.<br />
<br />
Presumably the recipients buy WoW tokens for a month's gametime. I've always saw WoW tokens as a big money maker for Blizzard. Cost £17 to buy, and are worth approximately £7-10 (1 month's gametime). Are they maybe seeing too much in-game gold being spent on them, and not enough real world?</div></div><hr />

Here is the thing that shoots your argument to shit. If it was an exploit it would be an actionable offense by Blizz, it is not.

I haven't seen anything like that in BfA yet (partly because I only leveled my Horde Paladin and Alliance Hunter).

If it was an exploit it would be an actionable offense by Blizz, it is not. There is no risk of suspension or account banning if someone was plevelling in this fashion. So get off the high horse and realize you are wrong in this situation.<br />
<br />
It's still an exploit, though. They haven't deemed it actionable, which is fine because it's not the worst exploit that puts you at a massive advantage (like actionable ones in the past have before), but it's still an exploit all the same. Facts are facts and that's tough sometimes, kiddo. But stay salty, it'll benefit nobody.</div></div><hr />

If there weren't freehold boosts, I would've quit WoW sooner than I already did. BfA questing is horribly unfun on repeat. I already leveled 8 characters the normal way, 2 more spamming island expeditions, and 3 doing timewalking....what's the big deal letting me level two more by paying someone my earned in-game gold for their time? <br />
<br />
THAT'S WHAT MMOs ARE ABOUT! Engaging with the community to find better ways to benefit yourself! My god Blizzard is so sad. Take away the reason to do BGs. Take away the reason to World PvP. Take away just about every reason to interact with other players in the world to benefit your own character.<br />
<br />
Just wait until they make the AI battlegrounds a thing you can do at any time, and recruiting your followers to go do mythic raids with you so EVERYONE can know what it's like to experience all the content. So laughable it's sad. <br />

Oh you mean like being able to buy a boost to 110? You mean being able to buy gear and potions to cut the leveling experience by more than half? Yeah, Blizzard doesn't care about the value of leveling. And neither do you if you think freehold boosts are the plague to the value of leveling compared to other things.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but your way of thinking is what got WoW in the position it's in. &quot;Your time&quot; means something, but someone being more efficient with their time means they shouldn't have it. Now we have LFR raiders running around with Mythic ilvl gear because their &quot;time&quot; spent in the game should equal to that of a mythic raider. HA!</div></div><hr />

Incorrect, an exploit is an actionable offense. You cannot be actioned by Blizz by levelling people in dungeons while exp is turned off. Period. Thus it is NOT an exploit.

WarcraftSecrets (https://twitter.com/WarcraftSecrets/status/1140393688272723969) pointed out that Patch 8.2 adds Experience Eliminated (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/206662-experience-eliminated), which reduces XP from mobs and quests by 95% if anyone in the group has experience disabled. This was likely done to stop Level 110 characters from boosting players to 120 quickly. <br />

My buddy actually used one of the power leveling services the other day. He went from 110-120 stupid fast. I thought it was really cool that it could be done that way. I don’t think it’s actually a big enough issues to patch out. Kind of wish blizzard would let players break the game more often, I don’t c how leveling a bit faster ruins the game for anyone.</div></div><hr />

Leveling is valueless. Time is what has the value now. If you want to spend your time using a lesser method - that's your fault. Like I said, MMOs and RPGs are about maximizing efficiency to be better than the next player. You and many other casuals don't like this way of game play and would rather be on the same level so your time equals another. <br />
<br />
Before, time spent in WoW meant higher levels, which gave value to both. With boosts, leveling gear and other things, leveling has little to no value, and it's all about being efficient with your time now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BananaHandsB</div><div class="date">2019-06-17, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It’s by definition an exploit, so that point isn’t even debatable - the developers didn’t intend for people to level this way, which is why it’s an exploit. Using other mechanics to essentially avoid levelling through the intended content with the use of a lower level may be a clever discovery, but it’s still an exploit (due to the above). That’s just facts, because that’s what an exploit is (as is the definition of an exploit). <br />
<br />
By your definition, glimmer of light pallies are exploiting because the developers didn't intend it to be used the way it is, yet they've stated they think player discovered playstyles are something they love and are ok with, but still need to be kept in check. They've also said several times for something to be considered an exploit it needs to create a competitive advantage. If this was an exploit, they'd be banning people. This was clever use of mechanics and as such are not banning people, but that doesn't mean it's something they want left in the game permanantly so they are tempering it with this nerf, just like they are nerfing glimmer pallies (slightly). Not an exploit, but still something they feel needs to be kept in check.</div></div><hr />

Current: Ok, we will release raid 2 weeks after patch, LFR wing coming out 3 weeks later. Quests added/opened in patch cycle.<br />
Back In a day: Ok, so you can't enter this dungeons until you have X, Y and Z. <br />
<br />
Second one has way more RP charge in it, but still is a time sink. TBC had time gates/daily quests, WotLK had time gates, daily quests/limited attempts even. The best expansions ever u know? Not even talking Mists of the Zone where all you do are daily quests.<br />
<br />
I dont consider daily quests/reputation gains into it since it was in WoW always like you said.<br />
<br />
Neck (weapons before) is what time gated content is. World quest rewards every day is what timegated content is. And also storyline opening on weekly basis instead of just letting people consume content on their own pace. And as you can see these are features only in last 2 expansions.<br />
<br />
They want people to come log in do their stuff and then not log for a few days. Few weeks of gated content and you need at least 2 months of sub time.<br />
<br />
In china they used to pay for time spent in game but 3 years ago they changed it to subscription like we have it. I wonder why that happened.<br />
<br />
Sometimes these thoeries are far-fetched but with this much evidence and blizzard always hunting slightly better and faster ways of progressing within game these theories are not far from truth.</div></div><hr />

If it was an exploit, why didn't they fix it two years ago? Blizzard could deem anything they want as an exploit. Labeling this as an &quot;exploit&quot; fits their need to have more money in a dying game. They don't care about leveling. They want people to bask in the horrendous leveling system they have currently, with no MMO-like options to exist, which this freehold leveling was. They WANT people to hate leveling, to buy into the boost. It's selling 101.<br />
<br />
See back to my original post. This is no exploit, this is just Blizzard furthering their destruction of an MMO. Plain and Simple.</div></div><hr />

Cool story. No reason for me to lie here, I gain nor lose nothing from it. Back in my original post, leveled 8 characters through questing in BfA, 2 through islands, 3 through timewalking, and did one through freehold before I unsubscribed. Didn't get to max out my last two characters though. Do I care that they removed freehold leveling? Not at all, it doesn't affect me. I'm just saddened by the continuous direction they are driving this game. It's far from what it was - an MMO. That's why I'm voicing my opinion here.</div></div><hr />

If you are going to sit on that gold, I couldn't care less. As soon as you start using it, you are messing up the economy of your server with gold that wasn't supposed to be there. <br />

<br />
Not at all - because that’s something that’s intended (as it’s a sold service). Having a lower level character with XP gain turned off boosting you so you can clear 110-120 is something that’s clearly not intended, thus it’s exploiting one system in favour of another. Is it bannable? Apparently not. Is it something that’s being fixed? Yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but that's simply a bad comparsion. While yes, blizzard wants all the money in the world, does it change the fact that this is actually cheating, and that it should be prevented?<br />
<br />
Not only this, countless &quot;leveling-services&quot; does exactly like this, disable exp from 110 up to boost other characters. Again, some more cheating allowed. It's not fun, it's preventing these &quot;services&quot; to be able to easily boost up other characters.</div></div><hr />

Leveling sucks. Raiding does not. Its not about repeating content, its about that there is no alternative to doing the same quests over and over again, that were already fucking boring the first time you had to do them. This is another prime example of how blizzard forces you to play there game in one way and one way only. Punishing everybody who does something out of the ordinary.</div></div><hr />

Its really not. You are complaining over something, that you don't have to do. If you already have 9 alts, there really should not be any content, that you can't do freely.<br />

Leveling after that point, has nothing to do with raiding. I don't even know why you bring it up in this context xD <br />

You are talking so much about Blizzard forcing you to do this and that, but in reality, that is just what the game is designed for. Its like complaining about driving around in cars in GTA, that you should be able to get around otherwise and that Rockstar is forcing you to behave like they want to...Like, why are you even playing at that point, if a core feature of the game, it being repeating content in WoW, is boring and tedious for you?

It's not a stupid question at all. Nobody has 10 characters that they raid on. Most people have MAYBE 2-3 alts. If you have a 10th character getting to max level, that's just you being bored.

It's simple: they disabled cheat leveling. Naturally there's an uproar!<br />
<br />
cheating implies dishonesty or unfairness. No part of the rules of the game specifically say how you're supposed to level, nor specifically say that levelling by boosting is against said rules. So the fact it's not intended does not make it the same as cheating. Cheating implies dishonourable action.</div></div><hr />

You dont need 10 characters to hate leveling. Remember WoD, where there were more than 3 questing zones? You could do quests, collect treasures, do bonus objectives or stand in your garrison and do one xp mission per day. That was good leveling. BFA leveling sucks and blizzard destroyed one of the ways to escape it.<br />
<br />
The game is not designed for leveling. Leveling is just a method to nerf all your gear and stats. Its about the endgame.<br />
<br />
And some people need more than 1 char for raiding for setup purposes. Crazy right? <br />
<br />
Also people calling this boost method an exploit? I bet they think that boosting people in raids and mythic+ is also an exploit. Fucking hell, people nowadays...</div></div><hr />

Best way to do it is to make the game fun, so people wouldn't be interested in &quot;pay to skip&quot;. <br />
<br />
Oh wait, modern gaming design is rotten to the core by the influences of mobile and f2p games that are irritating to play to push people towards &quot;pay to skip&quot; and &quot;pay for convenience&quot;. <br />
<br />
Whole token system relies on people buying gold in the first place for their irl $$$ and what do they spend extortionate amounts of gold? Overpriced vendor mounts and boosts... mostly boosts. Gold generation got also strangulated to the point only people making money are full time boosters and full time ah flippers, rest can go buy a token... haha. <br />
<br />
Boosters exist because there's a customer base, if people stop being interested in being carried through content for the rewards instead of actually playing the content, boosters will have to pack up and go home. <br />
<br />
But nope, the whole game design is reward driven and not gameplay driven. Everyone from meager world quester or lfr player to the top tier pvper or hardcore raider or m+ pusher plays the game for the rewards of various kind, not for the &quot;fun and challenge&quot;, don't get deceived when anyone claims it's for &quot;fun and challenge&quot;, any tweak to the reward system anywhere in the pyramid and you can see clearly it's 100% about chasing the carrot as the uproar starts. And the people pay to skip to the carrot right away, so we have market for boosts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
“In video games, an exploit is the use of a bug or glitches, game system, rates, hit boxes, speed or level design etc. by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers.”<br />
<br />
Levelling in this way isn’t how the developers intended, hence it’s an exploit. If they didn’t mind they wouldn’t have implemented this change, but they have. It’s an exploit to the levelling system and they changed it. Banging on about them not doing anything during Legion is pointless because this isn’t Legion, so whoever’s decision to not change anything then has either changed their mind on the matter or the person in that role has changed and has a different view. Regardless, levelling system exploit got changed, the end.<br />
<br />
Oh oh happy it makes me when people don't use logic in their statements. Let's unravel the two points in which you failed to do so. <br />
<br />
1) &quot;Leveling in this way isn't how the developers intended, hence it's an exploit.&quot; &quot;Just because the devs did not intend you to level in a certain way, doesn't make something an exploit. For example, that guy who always goes to max level by herbalism only in the Pandaren starting zone. The devs did not intend on anyone to level that way, but it is still not an exploit.<br />
<br />
2) Technically, boosting others with a BiS geared 110 is neither unintended nor gives anyone an advantage (hence not withing your definition of an exploit.) That is an absolutely intentional part of the games mechanics. They intended the world to scale to the players level, in an instance or outdoors, and intended for characters with superior gear to perform better. The system that stopped players from gaining experience was also never intended (until now) to stop others in your group from gaining full experience.<br />
<br />
Hence, disabling experience and boosting people with a lower level character was in fact NOT an exploit. Blizzard also never considered it as one, they never suspended anyone for it, for these very reasons I stated in part two above. From now on though, it will be considered an exploit if you somehow find a way to give full experience to your party members when you have disabled experience</div></div><hr />

I was mostly referring to the “play the game properly”-part. I just think Blizzard and their approach to leveling is a joke. The fact that you can skip the leveling with money shows that it is not an important part of the game anymore. It just an annoying barrier now that you need to pay to skip. Leveling is like standing in queues for the rides in amusement parks. They should let people skip leveling for free (or remove leveling from the game) as we are already paying a subscription.<br />
<br />
In legion you could skip leveling by transferring resources from your main to your alts. I’m not sure that was intented by Blizzard originally.</div></div><hr />

Less spam in trade, so its a good change imho.<br />

I don't really see what you find enjoyable about Max level WoW, After Reached Exalted with 7th legion and unlocking the allied race, I don't really see a reason to play anymore, since more Rep is pointless. <br />

<br />
Boosting has been a fact of the game for years, and this isn't just sold for gold. One affects the other, if they stop real money boosting, gold boosting will inevitably be affected. <br />
<br />
The boost sold by them is priced to put people off from buying it, AND doesn't go to 120. If their end goal was to sell more boosts on their own, they'd lower the price and let us buy level skips at 10 levels or 20, as well as making the big boost go to max level from the start rather than at the end of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, so you play the game completely differently to me, which is fine. I want to raid and maybe do some M+. Everything else is just a means to getting there. How does me getting to the part I enjoy faster hurt your enjoyment?

Different people like different things.<br />
<br />
I enjoy the process of leveling AND max level, but I still hate certain steps in the leveling process. 1-60 is shit. Outland, Northrend, Cata zones are ineffective, repetitive and boring. MoP + is where the leveling becomes something more than repeating quests. WoD is amazing with its bonus objectives, XP-giving treasures, elite mobs dropping quest items etc. Legion has bonus objectives and Invasions.<br />
<br />
If I could, I'd gladly pay to skip up until level 80. Hoping the level squish will mean that we can level in MoP+ content exclusively, bypassing the old, dated, shitty content.</div></div><hr />

I think the level squish will just be that.. a Number squish, But it will still require the same XP 1-New number as the current 1-120. I don't think they will reduce the time it takes to hit max level, So after squish each level will just take A LOT longer.</div></div><hr />

They already tried making each level take a lot longer, and had to reverse it due to an outcry.<br />

Are you really that naive? Or do you just think the world revolves around you? How is Blizzard going to detect these people if they keep things 100% off of their services? Blizzard would have to install spyware on our system well beyond what Warden already does, and t would need to run 24/7 unlike Warden.

<br />
Second, they're not &quot;hurting&quot; anyone. They have made tons of changes like this in the past such as the security fix that broke the addon that allows cross-faction understanding.

If you're going to make an argument, use facts, not supposition you pulled from your butt. In case you have forgotten, the last known subscribers figure was ~5,500,000 back in November of 2015 which was the final time Blizzard would announce them.<br />

Which has absolutely nothing to do with this exploit fix.<br />

Wasted development time is coming up with work-arounds to an exploit fix because little entitled children are screaming on the Internet.<br />

Agreed. If they wanted to keep 110s from boosting people while locked, they should've just made it so that any 110 that's grouped with non-locked people will gain XP (not counting BGs).<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and if you're just randomly queueing up for islands solo, it also shouldn't apply. I mean if you're grouping with someone, then going into a dungeon or queueing for something, that's when you should be penalized. I don't think they should penalize 110s for grouping with people to do normal quests.</div></div><hr />

I'm not the brightest berry in the bunch so the times when i've guild raided (mostly in WoD &amp; Legion) i've often been treated in a very Demeaning/made fun of way, But i just diden't let it bother me, since the guild is a means to an end to get the gear, so you just have to put up with it in order to progress.

In case you have forgotten, the last known subscribers figure was ~5,500,000 back in November of 2015 which was the final time Blizzard would announce them.<br />

Not going to argue the rest of the useless crap in your post, but we know people are fleeing WoW, and Blizzard games in general, en masse. Both wows revenue alone and blizzards overall MAUs and revenue are dropping like rocks<br />

Hard way? Did you grind boars? Cause there isn't a &quot;hard way&quot; there's mindlessly grinding through easy zones and quests though</div></div><hr />

I'm a loyalist to them through and through, but I don't level Twinks and this effects me and my playstyle like they wouldn't believe!<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't they realize how often someone might lock their XP to help their friend Catch up to them? This has nothing to do with boosting a char, it's playing with my friend on the DESIRED characters, and then pausing my XP while we did Dungeons together until he caught up.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't care much for the exploit being fixed, go ahead and stop Twinkers.. But now I can't level the desired character I want with a friend if they're leveling range is too far. I have to wait for him to level alone. <br />

Unreal Blizzard, you've gone and upset one of your biggest, most ass-kissing fans.</div></div><hr />

I get sick in the stomach just seeing this. Fix your game, stop selling boosts. (including m+ boosts/raid boosts) Gosh... the amount of greed is unreal.</div></div><hr />

You know, because maybe they enjoy end game content but not leveling. I know I hate leveling and yet I have 14 120s because I want to play endgame content on them.<br />

Maybe nobody you know. I definitely have in the past and probably would now if I had people to raid with that many characters on, but unfortunately the devs keep doing dumb shit that makes people want to play less.<br />
<br />
Then i expect you find the journey worth the while or you would not have done it :) <br />
<br />
The person just acts as if the only reason he could endure the pain of leveling, was to be boosted in the lvl 110-120 bracket. If it is really that much of pain, to the point of breaking because it might take 1-2 day more of relaxed play, then i think he is pushing himself.</div></div><hr />

Ok to you and everyone demand a fix. Stop being vagur, bring out a detailed list of fixes that will please EVERYONE there are over 7 billion people on this planet and as a business it's their job to make every product please every single one of them. (exagerating here but bare with me)<br />
<br />
so in a game where if you get 10000 people you're get double the wants.<br />
<br />
Should blizzard a) Try to please all of them even if failing at times.<br />
<br />
or B) Say fuck you to everyone that isn't liking the game your way so you can have a handful of like minded people playing.</div></div><hr />
