Might be so, but every healing class except paladins can use staves. There isn't one equal to this mace in awesomeness, but there are definatly good ones. Imo this should always be pala prio.</div></div><hr />

Seriously that sort of attitude stinks. Basically the effect gives the healer a 15% of the amount healed (note not over-healed) as a shield for 15 seconds. What this means is that if you over-healing is very low in the first place (which druids are at around 23% overhealing vs paladins 60%), and the way Druids heal, then this has a bigger impact on the over all raid. If you raid heal, the tank is usually covered as all the healers expect them to take damage and usually they have sacred shield on them and are getting 20k heal bombs every 2 seconds. It's the spiky raid damage that can be more of an issue. So giving this to a raid healer is more useful initially. <br />
<br />
Remember at this point if a tank is having problems your paladins probably have the 4 set tier 8 bonus so, sacred shield triggers every 4 seconds and wears this for certain fights as this is more of a consistent shield.<br />
<br />
I would probably give this to 2-3 raid healers first and then look at giving it to tank healers. The benefit to the raid far out ways the benefit a tank will gain from it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's clearly a good idea giving it to a certain class based on arbitrary factors such as the availability of alternatives, rather than giving it to a player based on factors like the individual's skill, how consistently they perform at a high level, how dedicated they are to attending all raids, how much or little they bitch and moan in raids, how much they're prepared to put in a supreme effort to help the comm progress etc. etc.<br />
<br />
As has been pointed out 20 billion times already, the weapon's as good for Holy Priests and Resto Druids as it is for Pallies. You give the thing to your go-to Healer, and everyone in every comm should know who that guy or girl is. Snuggleme (crap name aside) is no doubt the healer they trust/like/respect the most. Grats to him/her, and less whine with your cheese please.</div></div><hr />

What you on about? It counts overhealing to the shield, though a full 100% overheal on a spell doesn't trigger the proc to start getting shield on casts, but its not like 60% overhealing on a paladin means that 60% of his heals are 100% overheal :P Even if you just heal 1 and 9999 is overhealing you can still proc the shield and if you already got the shield blessing that is still 15% of the healing to the shield (not 15% of the 1 that healed)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
lol...i have 2 things to say about this statement. <br />
<br />
1 - warriors can use staves...doesn't mean it's the best weapon for them.<br />
<br />
2 - you honestly think a shaman should use a staff?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now we await the next legendaries!<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I'd have to assume the next legendary will be a dagger. If they don't want to go the dagger route, I think it'll be a 2h melee weapon.<br />
<br />
1st - 2h mace (2h melee)<br />
2nd - 1h sword (1h tank/DW melee)<br />
3rd - Staff (caster)<br />
4th - 1h swords (DW melee)<br />
5th - Bow (hunter)<br />
<br />
Judging by the trends (and the fact that I don't think Blizz would do a healer mace then dps caster dagger in a row), I'd guess we'll start back at the beginning of the list.....unless, of course, they go the dagger route...but I think they found out with Thori'dal that legendaries for 1 class are stupid.</div></div><hr />

But people in this game can do both PvE and PvP and be good at it, he is 5th on 2v2 and 2nd on 3v3 for PVP but also he got a lot of hard modes in ulduar done , including, one light in the darkness.<br />

If they don't want to go the dagger route, I think it'll be a 2h melee weapon.<br />
<br />
1st - 2h mace (2h melee)<br />
2nd - 1h sword (1h tank/DW melee)<br />
3rd - Staff (caster)<br />
4th - 1h swords (DW melee)<br />
5th - Bow (hunter)<br />
<br />
Judging by the trends (and the fact that I don't think Blizz would do a healer mace then dps caster dagger in a row), I'd guess we'll start back at the beginning of the list.....unless, of course, they go the dagger route...but I think they found out with Thori'dal that legendaries for 1 class are stupid.<br />
<br />
My Vote goes for a shield, if a legendary comes out before or instead Frostmourne. Something with a quest where you can choose between a tank and a caster shield.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While a shield would be cool, it isn't a weapon. A legendary shield just simply isn't as &quot;legendary&quot; as a weapon, especially if it can be a caster shield. As far as I know, there are no great &quot;defenders&quot; that will be in Icecrown, that a legendary shield would be from.<br />
<br />
If there was a member of the scourge or something that was notorious for having impenetrable defenses, then his shield would make a quality legendary, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: and Frostmourne could very well be the next legendary, but they'd have to destroy all of it's lore with some insane quest line, or else using your shiny new legendary will turn you into the lich king.........and there can't be more than 1 of those anyway.</div></div><hr />

Hey, if you don't like it, there are a TON of people who will take it off your hands. Do you think it's really that bad? Seriously.<br />

No Grats to the person who obtained the weapon and spent countless hours and most likely had 100% raid attendance in addition to spending a truck load of DKP for these fragments in the hopes of a weapon in 6 months time or no response as to why its better for paladins, just <br />

We have received many questions about how the proc works on Val’anyr, the Hammer of the Ancient Kings. While we originally intended for this effect to be a mystery, we realize that guilds now know what the tooltip on the proc says without necessarily knowing the details on how it works. This leads to situations where a healer may not know if assembling the hammer is worth it for them (hint: it is), and perhaps even worse, a misinformed leader may not think you deserve the hammer (hint: you do).<br />
<br />
<br />
A druid casts Rejuv on the tank, healing her. The Blessing procs on the druid on the second tick. A shield is applied to the tank which absorbs 15% of the amount healed by that tick and each remaining tick of the Rejuv. If the druid also gets Lifebloom and Regrowth on the tank while the Blessing is up, then those ticks also contribute to the shield. If the shield goes down because the 8 sec duration expires or it absorbs that much damage, it can go up again as long as the Blessing lasts, which is 15 sec. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously you are misinformed or have no idea about the way the proc works (which none of us really understand fully at this point)<br />
<br />
It is clearly a hunter weapon as stated in blizzards post. Damn I forgot hunters can't use maces :'(</div></div><hr />

The mace was surely meant for DKs to Death coil themselves while in Lichborne offering them more Survivability! <br />
<br />
It doesnt really matter who got it, <br />

They killed lots of 25man Ulduar Bosses<br />
They got the Shards<br />
They formed the Mace<br />
They Decided to give to the Druid<br />

They surely have their reasons and this mace is viable for everyone; paladins can holy light and make the shield much more powerful and druids can put it up more times due to their HoTs.</div></div><hr />

Few things. Glaives also have... Oh thats right, the WARRIOR class requirement.<br />
And you can't just 'take&quot; thunderfury, its a very long process to get it, and its not specifically a tanking weapon so kudo's to him for wasting so much of his time to get it on a hunter.<br />

It's called rating buster. It tells you the appropriate stats for your class and converts the stats of the item appropriately.

<br />
1 - warriors can use staves...doesn't mean it's the best weapon for them.<br />
<br />
2 - you honestly think a shaman should use a staff?<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I'd have to assume the next legendary will be a dagger. If they don't want to go the dagger route, I think it'll be a 2h melee weapon.<br />
<br />
1st - 2h mace (2h melee)<br />
2nd - 1h sword (1h tank/DW melee)<br />
3rd - Staff (caster)<br />
4th - 1h swords (DW melee)<br />
5th - Bow (hunter)<br />
<br />
Judging by the trends (and the fact that I don't think Blizz would do a healer mace then dps caster dagger in a row), I'd guess we'll start back at the beginning of the list.....unless, of course, they go the dagger route...but I think they found out with Thori'dal that legendaries for 1 class are stupid.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree, at this point they'll only be weapons a good chunk of classes can use. Granted I don't care too much what it is, because I'm a feral druid, and they will never make a legendary weapon that's awesome for a feral druid.</div></div><hr />

But people in this game can do both PvE and PvP and be good at it, he is 5th on 2v2 and 2nd on 3v3 for PVP but also he got a lot of hard modes in ulduar done , including, one light in the darkness.<br />
Basically he is just a pro players in a pro guild, who is very good at both.<br />
<br />
you mean &quot;pro player in a pro ninja guild?&quot;<br />
grats to the legendary ninjas on the server sense prebc to getting the worlds first legendary mace, on their own.<br />

2) Once procced, all healing (including overheal) applies a stacking shield equal to 15% of the total healing done, stacking up to 20,000 absorption.<br />

Edit: And what's with the pvp QQ? Seeing as he got the mace he obviously does alot of PVE, and as previous posters have said, you can do both PVE and PVP. When the raids are done for the night, and this guy goes to play some arena instead of logging out like most of the PVE-only players, that's a wasted mace? He's obviously very dedicated to PVE or he wouldn't get it in the first place. ._.</div></div><hr />

We're in Northrend! We came here for the sole purpose to burn the Frozen Throne to the ground! That was the entire objective! Kill it with fiyah! Now that Ulduar and Naxx are gone and done, Arthas' raid is a lot closer!<br />
<br />
&lt;_&lt; Wait for it... ... ... What is the most infamous weapon in the World of Warcraft (if you include WC3 lore) ... o.o FROSTMOURNE! DOY! Actually, despite Frostmourne being immensely important, I can name at least two other weapons that had a spot in lore: Doomhammer and Gorehowl.<br />

<br />
<br />
=D Great job on the first Legendary Healer item in the game, Drood! May your tanks never die and your DPS be smart enough to not take damage!<br />
Again, wrong. Val'anyr is far from the first legendary healer weapon. Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22632) was the third legendary weapon released, and look at that, it has a healing version. It's also way better lore-wise, because it has an origin, rather than something pulled from the list of 'Things-that-are-not-needed-but-will-make-people-play-more-for-in-order-to-get-it'.<br />
<br />
In short, Atiesh &gt; Val'anyr.</div></div><hr />

anyway i agree not a pure paladin weapon<br />
<br />
idk if the shield works from overhealing but this should go to the healer that can put out the most healing in the 15 sec duration<br />
now there are loads of factors in this but it isn't impossible to consider that a druid can be usign this well<br />
<br />
also druids are not as much over healing cuz the hots respond to the tanks damage faster then the paladin can cast .....<br />

Would be completely situational. The bubble from the proc doesn't last that long and you just blew a 10 minute cooldown to do it. Plus the bubbles themselves wouldn't be all that big. <br />
<br />
You could get a much larger bubble on a single target that would most likely be more beneficial to the raid but just putting the healing spells where they need to go.</div></div><hr />

You clearly didn't read the part where GC said that HoTs will still add to the shield even with a target at full health. Oh what? You are just as clueless about other healing classes as you are about theres? What?<br />
<br />
3) If you have the blessing (i.e. you caused healing and the proc occured) then overhealing will count towards the bubble. Hots that tick on a target will still contribute to the bubble. You can also choose to switch to a direct heal if you don't have enough GCDs available to get all of your hots up before the blessing fades. The confusing part here is that hots that don't heal won't cause the blessing (we didn't want you fishing for the bubble before a pull by constantly healing the tank, though I suppose you could if your tank was injured). But once the blessing is active, then all of your healing spells will contribute to the bubble even if they do no actual healing.<br />

It counts overhealing to the shield, though a full 100% overheal on a spell doesn't trigger the proc to start getting shield on casts, but its not like 60% overhealing on a paladin means that 60% of his heals are 100% overheal :P Even if you just heal 1 and 9999 is overhealing you can still proc the shield and if you already got the shield blessing that is still 15% of the healing to the shield (not 15% of the 1 that healed)<br />
<br />
<br />
Show the combat log that confirms your assertion please. You have no idea whether the proc will be 15% of the amount healed (and not overhealed) or the total healing amount of the cast. If it is only the actual amount of damage healed, then it becomes significantly less attractive for paladins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The proc has already been explained that the shield is 15% of the total heal, not the effective heal. In order for the healer to proc the buff, it must be an effective heal, but once they have the blessing then all healing, over healing and effective, goes towards the shield. If you do not believe me, the blue posts was linked earlier in this thread by myself. Please look at it. It is amazing for any healer that doesn't have their head up their arse and can pull reasonable HPS. No combat logs are necessary as it has already been explained by the people who designed it.</div></div><hr />

IMO your O sucks. There's a MH/OH combo better than the staves out there anyway. It's good for every healer equally pretty much.<br />

<br />
<br />
Are you for real? There has been multiple blue posts HEAVILY detailing EXACTLY how it works. It's 15% of the TOTAL amount of the heal, regardless of how much it ACTUALLY heals. But it does have to heal at least 1 HP.<br />
<br />
Example - Warrior is missing 1k HP. The mace has procced and the Priest has the buff on him now. He heals the warrior and the heal it's for 3k (2k overheal). The bubble that procs will be 450 HP, 15% of 3k.<br />
<br />
Here is the main blue post explaining the proc...<br />
like I just did...<br />
http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=16903512910&amp;sid=1<br />
<br />
Here's the most informative paragraph if you don't feel like clicking that. It explains it without an example, but I gave you one already, it also tells you all the other nifty technical stuff like internal CD, how long the shield lasts, stacking, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
The way this works is that when the proc happens (which is a 10% chance whenever a hot or direct spell heals, with a 45 sec internal cooldown) you gain a buff (the Blessing) on yourself. Now all of your heals for the next 15 sec cause an 8 sec damage shield. The shield stacks with itself. It includes healing done by subsequent ticks of existing hots on the target. Note that the spell has to actually heal, so hots ticking on a fully-healed target cannot cause the proc. However the shield is based on the size of the heal itself, not the amount healed &#8211; i.e. 100% overhealing will not proc the Blessing on the healer, but the shield itself includes overhealing once the Blessing is active. The shield can grow to a maximum size of 20,000 damage absorbed.</div></div><hr />

It should be given to the most reliable, consistent, skilled healer in your guild regardless of class [unless they're a disc priest]. Someone that works hard and you don't have any concerns they might leave anytime soon. It's a really good mace and will be a help to your raid if the healer wielding it knows how to play. Some fights you'll wish a tank healer had it and some fights you'll wish a raid healer had it. Look at Ensidia. They had 2 of their co-GMs /roll for it. They probably min/max as well as anyone in the world and they decided to give it to either of their most dedicated healers, regardless of what class they played.<br />
<br />
Most people that are getting this mace have earned it over the last few months/years. Be happy for them.<br />

I really, really hope they do. Just disable the proc in arena/battlegrounds and it's fine.</div></div><hr />

There isn't one equal to this mace in awesomeness, but there are definatly good ones. Imo this should always be pala prio.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, when you get in a guild and play your Pala healer, you can give it to whomever you wish.<br />
As it stands, they killed it. Their loot. Obviously, they must be doing SOMETHING right in order to even get the item in the first place.<br />
<br />
I really tire of threads that say... XYZ is XYZ class item. Especially when the majority of posters will never see said item, or even know anyone that has it personally. <br />
<br />
Also: since it's the WORLD FIRST item, the posters that claim it's better for XYZ based on tooltips must know better than what the actual item does, right? Right? Tooltips are never vague or misleading or anything...</div></div><hr />
