Yes, in 6.0 auction houses are unified between factions on a given server. The benefit you cite is a major reason behind the change." />

why is it bad news ?<br />
as a player with access to all professions, all I can see is potential customers, LOTS of them, which means even more gold!<br />
Sure there will be some fighting for mats off the AH, but any serious crafter has guild bank tabs full of crafting mats stored up when prices are low or from suppliers.<br />

On the whole I think this is a fantastic idea.</div></div><hr />

Because if we can trade with them via the AH, what difference is it if we trade with them in person? (Aside from the 5% AH cut obviously). And to trade in person we need to be able to talk in person. Plus you can already effectively talk to players on the other faction, just target them, right click, add friend, add battletag friend. Then delete them 5 minutes later after you've said what you want to say.<br />
<br />
Also curious how this is going to work with stuff like the Mechano Hog / Mekgineer's Chopper, having the race restrictions on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lower prices for everyone is better than a handful of players swimming in gold. <br />
<br />
This change is good. If they want to step it up a notch:<br />
- have identical listings on the AH only have one listing with a count number. No more 100 listings of the same thing, but one listing with a 100 count.<br />
- allow players to place requests on the AH. Need a glyph, but it isn't on AH (or the ones that are are pricegouging)? Put up your request on the AH and you can be on your way. It would allow people to get what they want without having to wait around for someone to trade with. This system would be perfect for professions with a large range of wanted items, like glyphs and gems.<br />
- break AH addons that pretty much automate buying, selling, relisting, price scanning and emptying mailboxes.<br />
- give an option to not show items without a buyout, or require a buyout price for all auctions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well yes, there will be more competition, however the bigger the market place the more opportunities arise for profit, and not every player has levelled all the professions for themselves, and these are the people you need to target as they will need to buy stuff from the AH at some point.<br />
<br />
The only thing I think that will cause any issues is the speed of the AH, Even using mods it can take a long time to scan, price, place, or even cancel auctions.</div></div><hr />

Those who play one-sided servers on the underpopulated side would finally be able to actually buy something from AH. Those who play balanced servers will have general AH prices lowered. Only one group of people don't like this change - AH barons who own trade. Well, who cares about those rich asshats, let them suffer, they were stealing our gold for literally years.<br />
<br />
Also, I hope this is a move towards end of idiotic orc vs human theme. We should unite to fight the greatest enemy of Azeroth - Burning Legion - instead of throwing shits at each other. We should be able to finally speak with one another, and form crossfaction groups. Player's race should be a matter of personal preference, not a stupid faction limitation.</div></div><hr />

Those who play one-sided servers on the underpopulated side would finally be able to actually buy something from AH. Those who play balanced servers will have general AH prices lowered. Only obe group of person don't like this change - AH barons who own trade. Well, who cares about those rich asshats, let them suffer, they were stealing our gold for literally years.<br />
<br />
Also, I hope this is a move towards end of idiotic orc vs human theme. We should unite to fight the greatest enemy of Azeroth - Burning Legion - instead of throwing shits at each other. We should be able to finally speak with one another, and form crossfaction groups. Player's race should be a matter of personal preference, not a stupid faction limitation.<br />
<br />
How about no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also don't understand why people are complaining:<br />
-lorewise, before Garrosh came in power, the Alliance and the Horde traded with eachother. In the Shattering book, it is stated that Hamuul goes to the night elves to try and restore the trade relations after they broke them. When Garrosh first comes to Orgrimmar, he sees the markets full, but the orc lady from Northrend whose name I forget tells him that it's all there just because of trade with allies and &quot;not-so-allies&quot; so to say. <br />
So lorewise it makes perfect sense to restore trade between factions after they ended the war. <br />
-this is a good change for both small and large servers - for small servers, let's be honest, the AH was dead already, so merging 2 small things will make it slightly acceptable, which means the people there might see things on it. For large servers, there was always someone driving the price down for ANYTHING so, while merging the AHs might lead to horribly low prices in the first few days, after that it will stabilize, in the end, even if you have more items on the AH, you also have twice the poll of people, so... don't see the problem?</div></div><hr />

As for this change... I really don't see all that much of a potential difference. Now that pets are account bound, there honestly isn't much of a difference between what the Horde and Alliance can obtain, and even those were tradeable over the blackwater cartel AHs. <br />
<br />
It's not like it allows for any sort of actual &quot;teamwork&quot; or &quot;communication&quot; across factions. There are really no gameplay ramifications at all, save for broadening the materials base. Which is never a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

No, because demand will rise as well. Markets will shift, yes, but it will still be very profitable to play the AH :)<br />

It will be hard on the people who used to transfer goods from A to H through the neutral auction house and less profit for the people who snatched those auctions ;)</div></div><hr />

You're selling your goods to goblins, not to the opposing faction. Who they sell it to is of no concern of yours; If it was, you wouldn't use the AH, just like you wouldn't use a bank or your country's currency if you didn't trust the bank and where your fiat money was going, who was using it etc etc. Right?</div></div><hr />

Well to be honest, you wouldn't waste over 10k on a profession if there were no AH fuckers who own a stock of resources needed to level profession. Its not actually hard to buy every 250-300/300-375 leather/weed/ore listed on AH to put them back at x200 increased cost.</div></div><hr />

I play on a big server, I don't pay much, glyphs cost 30-50g here. It's when I play alts on my old &quot;dead&quot; server and see 1-2 of each glyphs for 400g that I get upset.

Its not the same; not to metion that I'm also one of that particular AH fuckers as well. Problem is, it is too hard to own an endgame items market. Owning low-lvl resources market is way easier, requires way less gold to start with, and gives way more profits. I do understand though that it is wrong in many levels.<br />

The QoL of people engaging in some crappy little arbitrage loop should never take precedent over people playing the primary PvE and PvP content.

That argument is 100% bullshit and you know it. <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, if you just paid me $99, I could fill your bike tires with air. Just because you perceive tires full of air as useful/required doesn't mean you really need them, you can ride your bike with flat tires if you want. Or, you could go buy your own pump, which I also have available for $199!&quot;<br />
<br />
Rayaleith, you are no longer going to be able to mark up semi-mandatory items and materials. You'e going to have to work harder to maintain your cash flow. Does that make you angry? It would be nice if you just said what you meant instead of trying to dance around your actual opinion. You're part of the 1%, those few players who own an entire chunk of the AH and screw over anyone who doesn't possess tens of thousands of gold for items that are deemed necessary for above average PvE/PvP performance, and you don't want to give it up. <br />

One that, in my opinion, should have been done as soon as things like low population realms and huge faction imbalances became common issue. Most people didn't use the auction houses in the neutral goblin towns even though they were cross faction, due to where they were located (read: not inside your capital cities). This'll give the same funcion to all auction houses.</div></div><hr />

if you are lucky enough to find what you want to buy, it is usually 5x more price from Argent Dawn.

Tbf, they can still do that with this change...they'll just have more stuff that they'll need to control. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paulosio</div><div class="date">2014-07-01, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Problem is, they are somewhere out in the world, not in your faction hub.<br />
<br />
There is no problem with the lore because of this change.<br />
<br />
There are a bunch of goblins in the horde itself. Why is it hard to believe that wheeler dealer horde goblins would trade with wheeler dealer neutral goblins to make a larger profit ? There are even goblins running some of the horde AH'S. <br />
<br />
What makes it so unbelievable that they could take items placed on the horde AH and sell them to the goblins of booty bay, Everlook and Gadgetzan or even unscrupulous members of both factions trading directly with each other on the sly?<br />
<br />
Item placed on horde AH &gt; item purchased by unscrupulous person &gt; item sold on at a profit to other faction via blackmarket / undercover channels &gt; item appears on alliance AH.<br />
<br />
The same thing works for both ways.<br />
<br />
For the above reasons there is nothing in lore that really stops items from 1 faction ending up with the other faction... You just have to use your imagination and fill in how that happens by yourself if you care about such things. However it's not like you will actually ever know when someone from the other faction buys your items anyway so you don't even have to accept that both factions are trading with each other if it's something you really can't accept for reasons I can't fathom.<br />
<br />
It only goes against lore if the lore claimed that both factions had no dodgy members who would do underhand things to make money and that surely can't be the case. I know it's not the case because as a member of the alliance I admit that i'd sell to horde to make money because I care more about money than honor (if I was a roleplayer I could even roleplay this scenario)..</div></div><hr />

On the other hand if I want to make some profit off leather on Horde side that's gonna make the price of profession materials plummet. For example instead of 160-200g for magnificent leather as it is now it will be like 20-30g, which means less profit which isn't good :(</div></div><hr />

In game we are told how we cannot overcome the threat of the villain, if we don't overcome our differences.<br />
This became more than obvious with the WotLK expansion... Starting with the Lich King, we were told, and forced to work together. This continued with Deathwing, and now it's still the case with Garrosh.<br />
We have neutral factions that magically speak our languages. Like you said, we can fight the same enemy at the same time (world bosses etc). <br />
All in all, the War between Horde and Alliance is an antiquity. It's outdated, and the existing restrictions make no sense anymore, since the content in the game has long made them illogical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's certainly questionable; though the simple fact is this. For expansion after expansion, the Faction War has continued even in spite of these &quot;big, bad enemies&quot; that supposedly force us to unite. Like it or not, plenty of people actually like the Faction War; and plenty of people joined/played WoW because they liked the idea of it. This is just one reason why WoD is disappointing me; namely because i've heard from people playing the Alpha/Beta that the very first quest line sees the Alliance/Horde working together.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard wants to end the Faction Conflict and, for all intents and purposes, make PvP non-Canon/Out-of-Character; then they need to say so. It will certainly determine whether or not I continue to play this game, and people should absolutely expect people to defend the Faction Conflict if it is a part of the game/story they have enjoyed.</div></div><hr />

No one is proposing a forced merge either. If you character has a beef with A/H that's ok.<br />
But that shouldn't prevent you from learning the language of the enemy or trading with other collaborators.<br />

This is about following suit with the content. <br />
If the faction theme follows suit with the content, then the merged AH makes sense. Then it would also make sense how players could communicate with one another, and even group up/trade with one another. <br />
It's perfectly logic, how original enemies might become friends during the events of fighting a common much bigger enemy. That happens on the battle fields in the real world times and again. Enemies saving each others lives, and the list goes on. <br />
<br />
Here is what I think to be the REAL reason, why the restrictions aren't lifted yet to some degree....<br />
The irrational fanboys. People already insulting each other like cusswords going out of style, within their own factions... Imagine how they could insult the player of the opposite factions with words.... That would result in a clusterfuck of toxic environment. More than it already is.<br />
<br />
Lifting the restrictions by binding them to an extensive quest chain for example, would certainly be an epic undergoing. <br />
The mechanism exists in the game already..... Bloodsail vs Steamwheedle... Only the most dedicated players managed to be in good standings with both factions.<br />
Similar difficult it could be for a cross faction standing. <br />
<br />
While I respect the stance of pure horde vs alliance idea, and how some players want to stick to it. They should be able to do so.<br />
But at the same time, other players have long not seen any sense in the frozen front lines anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Impossible. Way too much bad blood on both sides to completely suppress it.<br />
Hell, even my Draenei kills every green skinned beast if it only looks at her the wrong way.<br />
<br />
Having a brawl here and there is ok and inevitable. But a dedicated PvP open world battlefield makes 0 sense when you go against a superior enemy with limited resources.<br />
We should pool our resources in order to succeed.<br />

Well, that doesn't seem to be what we're getting in WoD; not least with my former, favourite Alliance race (The Draenei) seeming to enthusiastically work alongside Blood Elves in numerous situations. The so-called truce in WoD does not seem to be in any way uneasy from what i've seen thus far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember: These Draenei were NEVER attacked by Kael'thas' Bloodelfs. It makes perfect sense that they work together, since both races have a nag for magics.<br />
Also Draenei hate violence and warfare. They always choose collaboration if that is an option.<br />
<br />
The AU Draenei being faction neutral is actually the correct way to handle them. They don't give an Elekks dung heap about A vs H and they were never forced into this conflict the way our MU Draenei were.</div></div><hr />

In before F2P cross faction raids. World of Warcraft was always about Alliance vs Horde. Really...<br />
It would be awesome to raid cross-faction. Especially since the player character is a mercenary, and mercenaries band together regardless of race.

Let's say you have a high population server with... 100k people!<br />
And let's say they're also balanced, so 50 each faction.<br />
<br />
10k people with maxed out professions on each side that constantly make stuff and 40k people who like to buy stuff on each side.<br />
So, of course, the percent per faction is 20% makers - 80% buyers.<br />
<br />
Now we merge the two auction houses. We now have 20k people selling stuff and 80k people buying.<br />
So, the percent is 20% makers - 80% buyers - hold on, nothing has changed for you and your high population server? It's still same percent, just more people. More sellers yet also more buyers. More competition? Well, slightly, but then, whomever tries to lower the price will be bought in seconds, so not really lowering prices. <br />
<br />
Where this change actually makes a difference though is on unbalanced servers. Where you have like 70% a faction and 30% another or even worse. Why? Because those people on the 30% side are getting screwed since their AH is devoid of stuff.<br />

Funnily enough, the world didn't end when the Faction War took place whilst we were faced with enemies such as Kel'thuzad and the Scourge, Ragnaros, C'thun, Nefarian, etc. The entire idea of having to choose &quot;one or the other&quot; has been a false dichotomy since Vanilla; but if Blizzard does indeed want us to choose &quot;one or the other&quot;, then they need to say so.</div></div><hr />

She worked with them before. She will do it again if survival requires it.<br />
Also she is intelligent enough to realize that the elves led by Voren'thal as well as the ones that stayed at home are as much victims of Kael'thas' betrayal than the Draenei.<br />
Orcs are another matter entirely though, since they went into legion service with open eyes and free will. (The leaders at least, the average grunt didn't get that choice)<br />
She does collaborate with them of ordered to do so, but the does not like it one bit.<br />

But that does not make her a freelance mercenary. She doesn't work for gold, she is a regular part of Darnassian / Draenei forces.</div></div><hr />

Rayaleith, you are no longer going to be able to mark up semi-mandatory items and materials. You'e going to have to work harder to maintain your cash flow. Does that make you angry?

<br />
If you don't get the purpose of 2 or more factions in a game with PvP servers... then I don't think you can be helped. The factions are split to limit the races you can play, it's designed around lore and to create and enable player vs player interaction. That's... basically it.</div></div><hr />

Veteran player here and I see no difference between having a market with more participants back when more people played and a market with more participants from having both factions use it. This is like being upset they added an AH to SW and Darnasus.<br />

If it's so important to you that nobody on the other faction buys your stuff (or gets gold from stuff you're buying), bark in trade chat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can easily just kill whatever you want. You don't need a so-called &quot;lore&quot; reason to kill orc and to spare human. In fact, this way you'll have twice the people to kill. Just as it was on TI with censer item. That's basically it.<br />

<br />
Like it or not, but faction pride is a thing, and so is the PVP.<br />
<br />
I don't care mostly. But lets look at this from a practical point of view. I start playing WoW with a kinda big community of real-life friends. Most of them wanted to join Alliance, so we decided to do so. But my favourite race was Undead. So it was either play a character you don't like, or don't play with people you like. Either way it was a lose (for me).<br />
<br />
Factions would mean something if there were a real war going on, and by war I mean endless pvp throughout the world based on territory control. Dividing playerbase into two parts just for the sake of dividing does not look practical to me. Yes, it is a ruleset of this particular game, and we all must play as rules say; but please don't pretend factions actually mean anything beyond crying &quot;Loktar Ogar&quot; during beer times with friends.</div></div><hr />

Interesting change...I'm neutral about it as most of the names on the AH selling things mean nothing to me AND since I play both sides this means prices will be normalized for my cross faction alts (seriously, some enchants for my Horde are like 2,000 gold while for my Alliance the same one is 500-900g on the same server).</div></div><hr />

Usually when we craft epics they have race restrictions (as in, if you're a dwarf and created a plate belt it can only be used by alliance races). Maybe those items will just show a warning at the AH, like if you were a warlock trying to buy plate armor.</div></div><hr />

Having separate faction auction houses has just led to economic issues, as well as people with 2 accounts on faction-imbalanced servers effectively gaming the system by smuggling low cost goods from the high-pop side to the low-pop side and marking up as much as 400% in some cases. Ultimately this means more competition which is good for both the sellers (who can now sell things quicker due to more demand) and the buyer (who gets lower prices).</div></div><hr />

Or they simply won't show if you are searching on a character that is the wrong faction/race.<br />

The Faction SPECIFIC items may very well only show when searched for on the correct faction.</div></div><hr />

You might not care about having different factions with different story and separated players in order to keep flaming and trolling down to a minimum during pvp. Others do. I don't drink beer nor do I yell Loktar Ogar, having factions in THIS particular game = something I love the feel of and practical boundaries as well as the lore it brings. Without the 2 factions, it would be players against environment, never TRULY 2 factions of players battling it out, no faction pride. What would a huge faction in this game even be called? Faction of Friendship?<br />
<br />
You can play the race you like the most since you are free to roll alts. Solved. I have 1 of max level on each faction, no problem at all.<br />
<br />
For people with your wish of being able to play any race the game has to offer without having to face faction boundaries, GW2 is that way &gt;<br />
<br />
The combined AH is awesome, but I'd dare say they will never move away from having 2 factions. Thankfully.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vigilate</div><div class="date">2014-07-01, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those of you complaining about lore, I've got two equally plausible scenarios on how this would happen:<br />
<br />
1) Neutral Goblins have realized very few people are using their Auction services due to their overly high rates. They have figured out that there's much more money to be made by playing both factions main auction houses. <br />
<br />
2) Due to the Alliance and Horde no longer being at open war with each other, they have have decided to sign a free trade agreement. Just because they're occasionally diametrically opposed to one another, does not mean they will not decide to trade with one another more to increase diplomacy. There are numerous cases of this happening in the real world.<br />
<br />
From a game play stand point, this will probably make people less hesitant to be a certain faction on some servers. I'll take my own server, US-Sargeras, as an example. You would be insane to play as Horde on Sargeras at the moment because there is just not a viable economy on Horde side. However, with this change, the Horde will have access to the vast markets that the Alliance has.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the problem with the neutral AH system is that it is separate from the regular faction AH. By listing your item there, you're essentially locking it out from the more widely-used AH systems in the major cities. On top of that, the cartel took a higher cut of the sale.<br />
<br />
Therefore people only really used it for faction-specific items like recipes and AT pets, and cross-faction gold/item transfer. Even the latter was problematic as most severs have bots that buy out anything you list for low prices in the process of trying to transfer.</div></div><hr />

This makes a lot more sense if you read &quot;Shadows of the Horde&quot;. It basically reads like a buddy-cop movie where Vol'jin (aka the new Warchief) teams up with a human hunter. Also Vol'jin is an extremely pragmatic dude that is a problem solver first and foremost, it's why Thrall put him in the driver's seat. <br />
<br />
Considering Orgrimmar just spent an entire patch cycle being ripped to shreds by both factions, and Stormwind is finally ramping up on renovations, it would make perfect financial sense to open trade between factions to rebuild their cities.</div></div><hr />

(that and I keep my best stock for myself. See: BoP Epics. Never sell the enemy a sword you don't already have a defense against!)<br />

<br />
That and the LORE reasons for moving the capitols was so that our factions had a city that they built themselves, rather than just freeloading with our friends on Dreanor. So far we haven't had an expansion where our main cities (for that expansion) were built by our own faction. Cataclysm was the closest thing to this, but it used the old and already established vanilla cities.</div></div><hr />

I'm on a german server that was dead...got merged with an other dead server(twice the population of mine).....and lost about 1/3 of its population since then. So after the merge we have twice the population we had before...problem is: Before the merge we had exactly 3 players online(both factions, all levels...really just 3 players on an entire server) at times. We are way behind in germany there....so don't beleive that merges solved the situation yet.</div></div><hr />
