You see, for normal people it's nice that we will get some extra rewards from daily emissary. It's people like you call a grind everything that has no weekly cap, because you have no self control. In the upcoming weeks I expect whines will be about:<br />
<br />
- how all your AP is worthless before 7.2, because you grinded Maw of Souls like crazy<br />
- how people with 54 trait have only like 2 trait advantage over people with 35 weapon<br />
- how all new traits cost 18+ million AP (and interesting that so few people understand that exponential grow AP for new traits actually help alts and newcomers)<br />
- how you have to do 100+ Maw of Souls runs to get paragon 20/20 again<br />
- how all your AP is worthless before 7.3, because you grinded Maw of Souls like crazy<br />
<br />
I wonder how many patches it must take for tryhards to understand that AP is not a grind, it is progression path for whole expansion and encourage you to do different types of content. While we will enjoy 7.2 content, tryhards will do mythic+ all day, spam forums and vendor rest AP until next patch. We will have fun, they few % more dps few weeks before us and massive burnout.</div></div><hr />

From my understanding it is simply offering the same caches as the emissary quests, only at a considerably lower rate.<br />

+1, ur post is so true, &quot;its not a grind &quot; -&gt; cucks your character by putting a negative 14.5 % damage aura permanently <br />
<br />
casuals should realise at the rate they play they will not even hit level 54 on a single artifact weapon at the end of xpac even with the help of AK 25, because the grind is still insane even with maxed out AK.</div></div><hr />

You're trying to argue that something in the game, that's going to give increased chances at obtaining new legendaries isn't mandatory for anyone who wants to raid seriously. Your &quot;its only a grind if you make it that way&quot; comment is complete bullshit, I'm sorry, but its true. Its a grind for anyone who wants to and will continue to take this game seriously when other people rely on them to do their most for progression raiding. AP is certainly a grind for anyone who raids and for anyone that wants to do mythic raiding. Everything this entire expansion is a grind to get power advantages to get boss kills. If you're too ignorant to see the truth, its not my fault that you're casual scum.</div></div><hr />

These are the traits that replace the old paragon points. At 35 you do the quest to unlock these new ones, the first trait in the line is unlocked after the quest chain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you aim for realm first or world x, you should deal with that you are trying to complete content that should last months in few weeks, end of story. Game was designed for 'hardcore' like you only in Warlords of Draenor - when game basically did all the chores for you. Look how this turned out. You are not center of universe, this is game, something for people to ENJOY. Many people play it to relax, because they are 'hardcore' in real life.<br />
<br />
You can perfectly fine raid mythic without grinding AP. Look for people like Preach, he clear whole content and don't grind at all. I raid normal and pug mythic+, do emissary and slowly level prestige. I got enough AP to get about 2 traits a week.<br />
<br />
<br />
These are the traits that replace the old paragon points. At 35 you do the quest to unlock these new ones, the first trait in the line is unlocked after the quest chain.<br />
<br />
I think it will be designed just like in 7.0 - you get regular traits while researching artifact knowledge (so 1-2 months), then we get paragon 20/20 again designed in mind that we already have AK 40. Then in 7.3 they again give bonus from paragon to everyone with regular traits, refund paragon and repeat.</div></div><hr />

3rd world problems :rolleyes:<br />
Finally hardcore means hardcore. Logging in just to raid isnt hardcore. Grinding like it used to be in vanilla is. For how much praise vanilla gets from hardcore players, you'd think they would LOVE the grind in Legion. The problem is in your head. You want the most ammount of rewards with the least amount of effort. I know a few previous exp taught you that bad habit, but it doesnt work that way.<br />
Also LUL at 'caps are good' - say that to the people who hate the quest for 80 essences from dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Guess WoD didn't teach everyone what happens when every 'grind' and 'chore' is removed from the game. <br />
<br />
But hey, if you feel like you can't compete with the rest of your guild because your artifact isn't maxed first week of a new patch, that is your issue. At some point every player will have to come to terms with that they are either going to always do what is required to always be &quot;best of the best&quot; when it comes to character progression (outside of gear), or they realize that no, you're not going to get benched because you haven't got a maxed weapon yet, and perhaps even realize that always having that extra mean of character progression feels good from a player perspective.<br />
<br />
But it's easy to complain about &quot;having to do more grinding&quot; when we, fortunately, haven't hit a point where people are all capped on AP and they realize that it feels kinda shitty not getting that AP boost at the end of a run. Especially if you were unlucky with drops. But this is part of subconscious game design and sadly most people don't give things like that a minutes thought. All they think of is evil moneygrubbing Blizzard wanting to prolong your sub by making you grind more. Meanwhile 90% of the players find themselves having a reason not to stand idle in Dalaran.</div></div><hr />

Idk. I unsubbed in Legion after the first tier of mythic raiding and I unsubbed in WoD after the clear of HFC. I got a burnout from all the completely repetitive farming in Legion. In WoD the farm was over once you got your garrison up on 1+ characters. Then you could focus on the things you liked most, be it raiding or something else since you could finish your &quot;daily chores&quot; in your garrison in about 5-10 minutes. In Legion you can't just do what you like. If you want to be a somewhat serious raider you have to farm AP.. every.. fucking.. day... You have to do M+ and emissary caches.. every.. fucking.. day.. for that mini random chance of a good legendary and AP. After 4 month of everyday stupid farm in order to be able to compete in a raid environment I just got enough of it and unsubbed.. With Legion WoW changed to a subscription-based asia grinder.</div></div><hr />

Then you could focus on the things you liked most, be it raiding or something else since you could finish your &quot;daily chores&quot; in your garrison in about 5-10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Case in point, non-commited raiders running out of character progression within weeks. Log in, send missions using an addon, log out and wait until raidnight.<br />
There's a reason WoD lost over 5 million subs. It barely had any non-raid content that progressed your character gear- or powerwise, due to complaints about &quot;mandatory chores&quot; in MoP. And why are they called mandatory? Because they earn character power in some way. Ie it's content worth doing. Removal of Valor in WoD, so barely anyone ran dungeons when overgeared so we're not &quot;forced to cap Valor every week&quot;. Yet another waste of content. WoD factions not giving pre-raid items so &quot;we don't have to do mandatory rep grinds&quot;. Professions (and especially gathering) being utterly gutted (bonuses etc) so that professions weren't &quot;mandatory for raiding&quot;.<br />
<br />
And poof. People hit i830+, raid, log off. Woo!<br />
Does anyone else who didn't raid in WoD remember that feeling like 2 weeks into 6.0 and you already asked yourself what there was to do?<br />
<br />
<br />
In Legion you can't just do what you like. If you want to be a somewhat serious raider you have to farm AP.. every.. fucking.. day... You have to do M+ and emissary caches.. every.. fucking.. day.. for that mini random chance of a good legendary and AP. After 4 month of everyday stupid farm in order to be able to compete in a raid environment I just got enough of it and unsubbed.. With Legion WoW changed to a subscription-based asia grinder.<br />
<br />
And what exactly is the issue with this? From a (MMO) game design viewpoint this is HEALTHY for the game. The only issue here is your self-imposed expectations. If you find M+ farming tedious, don't do it as much. If you don't feel like doing Emissary, don't do it until you feel like it. If you don't want to clear the whole world map of every AP WQ you see, don't.<br />
See the key issue here?<br />
<br />
<br />
months of everyday stupid farm<br />
That is the issue. Players who set these unrealistic expectations on themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
in order to be able to compete in a raid environment<br />
Who imposes these expectations on you? You or your raid team?<br />
<br />
But it's true, realm/world first Mythic guilds of course have high expectations because that is the very nature of cutting edge raiding. Going above and beyond what regular players do, because difficulty and dps/damage taken/coordination requirements gets so high.<br />
<br />
Well, to be blunt. Blizzard has already made the mistake of catering to the &quot;Just let us raid&quot; crowd, the crowd that spent most of MoP shitting themselves because of all the &quot;chores&quot;. Feedback from these players that hates everything that has the audacity to award player power / gear outside of raids is what gave us WoD, and they're hopefully never repeating that mistake again. Players complaining about having to do so many things means that there are always things to do. That's how MMORPGs has to function in order to keep players subbed. And surprise: more subs means a longer game lifespan.</div></div><hr />

Would you rather have literally nothing to do like you did in WoD?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Suggs</div><div class="date">2017-02-08, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's because your content consists on doing LFR and doing Dalaran laps, and mine is competing for realm 1st and keeping within the world first 50 guilds.<br />
<br />
Which was EASY before this endless farming crap. We only raided 4 days, 5 first 2 weeks, and then 1/week when farming, and we were stable in first 50. Now I had to rebuild from scratch just because Blizz ruined it with AP endless grind and legendary RNG, losing me loads and loads of friends and raiders. <br />
<br />
Each action has consequences. Caps are good. End of story. If it doesn't matter to you, it's because you don't run the content we are.<br />
<br />
Are you saying because you aim for realm first and you do mythics, top 50 bla bla bla you shouldnt have to do as much work to get it?!?<br />
Seems a bit hypocritical to me.<br />
If you want realm first and to be the best or whatever then you will have to work a fuck ton harder than any casual player will ever do.<br />
Entitled much?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I want to sit in Dalaran and experience the game by flying to the raid every week.</div></div><hr />

Your &quot;its only a grind if you make it that way&quot; comment is complete bullshit, I'm sorry, but its true. Its a grind for anyone who wants to and will continue to take this game seriously when other people rely on them to do their most for progression raiding. AP is certainly a grind for anyone who raids and for anyone that wants to do mythic raiding. Everything this entire expansion is a grind to get power advantages to get boss kills. If you're too ignorant to see the truth, its not my fault that you're casual scum.<br />
<br />
No, the actual requirement as dictated by blizzard, and what players decide is mandatory are often very different and this is one such example.<br />
As you just said, it is players seeking it, and therefore they make it a grind.<br />
If you must dismiss anyone disagreeing with you as &quot;casual&quot;, then it is you who is wilfully ignorant given like other elitists you misuse to dismiss anyone below your &quot;standards&quot;.<br />
<br />
Can't get someone to agree with you.<br />
Call them a fanboy, call them a casual, etc.<br />
<br />
You would have done exactly the same for a gear drop from any source, repeat it until you get what you want.<br />
Be that for a standard epic if its an upgrade, or for a legendary,</div></div><hr />

This right here is exactly the problem. There shouldn't be a way even if its called &quot;optional&quot; because it isn't optional by any means. When you put in distinct power advantages, that literally make or break a fight, those &quot;optional&quot; activities become mandatory. The same company saying its &quot;optional&quot; turns around and tunes the content around it, as if everyone has the best legendaries, max AP, full best gear from mythic+ dungeons. It's completely absurd. The expansion IS a grind, it IS forced content. Your raid group will NOT clear current content if everyone in the group doesn't at the very least max out AP and have decent legendaries. The Proof is in the statistics, under 100 guilds WORLDWIDE killed Mythic Helya in 6 weeks. Why? Because the content was tuned around having the best of everything. This was AFTER they nerfed the content 3 times that guilds finally started getting kills. So please, excuse me for calling you casual, because that's exactly how you sound acting as if you're a pretentious fanboy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a Hardcore mythic raider who is only interested in being in the top 50 world first guilds, i completely understand that maxing out everything is mandatory and therefore the most extreme measures must be taken to remain ahead or even with the curve..............blizzard truly have given you a hardcore gaming experience like it or not. So with the addition of the new traits in 7.2 you need to ask yourself do i really need to being doing this anymore, after all they are not forcing you to be a hardcore raider its personal choice. What you need to undestand is if the game is going to have any amount of longevity over an expansion to the median players, remember you are literally less than 1% of the total player base, there needs to be content to fill that void.<br />
<br />
To the typical non hardcore but mythic raider (here is where i slot in) then this increase is another milestone to reach, and will be reached in differentiating amount of times around this player base. Mainly due to time available balance against work/home life etc. Sure its still a grind, but i do not see it as something that has to be mandatorily completed before we can begin mythic raiding, after all we are not on the bleeding edge of content. What it does give however is still progression outside of gear dropping, so even tho that trinket i have been waiting for hasn't dropped im still improving since i managed to level up some of my artifact this week, which in turn also helps the chances of the raid. Some guilds may take that AP grind more serious than others but in no means will they be approaching the hardcore mentality as in these types of guild they only raid a few times a week and again are not interested in FW just the challenge mythic raiding has to offer. For these types of raiders it is most likely that they will max out their AP at some point, purely due to the amount of content they are completing each week.<br />
<br />
The same attitude can be really applied those more casual raiding guilds, by which i mean guilds that probably do not go into very much detail in vetting their members before joining, and indeed raid for the fun of it, probably maxing out at HC level. The grind for them is the same as above, but they will have less focus on it or maybe even less time but the grind is still achievable given time.<br />
<br />
And then there are the LFR guys, sure i get what ppl are saying that they will never see a completed artifact in the time of the content patch, but that is their choice these like the Hardcore raiders are at the other end of the scale, hell i doubt many of them even come on these forums and dont really give a flying fuck about AP, but again that is their choice.<br />
<br />
So in summary although the more hardcore playerbase among us see the AP system as a massive grind it is necessary for use peeps in the middle, who make up 90% of the actual raiding population, to keep us going with content and progression. Sorry if you are among the elite hardcore crowd, but that is your choice to be there entirely. I also get that you just want to kill the bosses first and all the other shit is just a check point you must put up with before you can get to said fights, but what are you actually now saying, that hardcore raiding has become too hardcore? <br />
<br />
At the end of the day this game is about making money for the company, and to keep the subscriptions rolling in each month it must keep that content interesting and where the money is, is in the brackets i described above, its basic economics you sell to the masses and don't pander to the minority.</div></div><hr />
