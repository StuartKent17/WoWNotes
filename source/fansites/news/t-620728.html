http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Retribution nerfs in the latest beta build<br />
Hello paladins,<br />
<br />
Sorry we didn't get a chance to pre-announce these changes before the data were pushed to the beta. I won't try to sugarcoat it -- these are nerfs.<br />
<br />
As I tried to explain before, we concluded a couple of weeks ago that Retribution was doing too much damage in PvP. We tried to nerf the burst damage through the previous changes to Divine Storm etc. Unfortunately, those changes didn't prove sufficient. Not only were paladins still destroying other classes in PvP, but we also found their PvE damage, even at level 80, was too high. Many classes were concluding they were too weak based on comparing their numbers to paladin numbers (and to be fair, hunters and in some cases mages and warriors).<br />
<br />
Here are the new changes:<br />
<br />
1) Judgements of the Wise: Mana gained reduced from 33% to 15% of base mana. We spent many hours arriving at this number. For example, we did a lot of Patchwerk fights, watching the mana bar to see when and if it ever went down. In BGs, we were seeing paladins able to go from target to target without pausing even when unleashing all of their attacks. While we don't want you to go OOM in a few seconds, we don't want you to ignore the mana bar either. Mana is not rage -- warriors can't typically start a battle with a full bar.<br />
<br />
2) Judgement of Wisdom: mana gained reduced to 1% of maximum mana and proc frequency cut by 50%. This ability was flat out better than Vampiric Touch when the mana provided between the two really needs to be close in order for the decision between Shadow priest and Retribution paladin to be a real one.<br />
<br />
3) Judgement and Seals: Damage reduced by 20%. This is the major damage adjustment -- a lot of damage was coming from these. We do realize this hurts Holy and Protection as well, and that is something for which we are prepared to offer compensation (particularly if it hurts Protection's threat generation).<br />
<br />
4) Hammer of Wrath: Now can’t be used until the target is below 20% health. Our rule of thumb is that core &quot;Execute-style&quot; abilities work at 20% and talented abilities work at 35% health. We originally had Hammer at 35% based on some other limitations of the spell.<br />
<br />
5) Art of War: Increased damage bonus to Judgements, Crusader Strike, and Divine Storm. I'll report back on the exact numbers here when we've settled on them.<br />
<br />
I also want to add that the token Blessing of Might change wasn't intended as a joke -- it is designed so that Battle Shouts won't cancel the longer and more expensive Blessing of Might in a group setting.<br />
<br />
These seem like pretty severe nerfs, but that was the intention. It is difficult for some players to ever be truly objective with issues surrounding their class, but in this case we felt Ret was severely overpowered. This was not in the realm of small tweaks to fix (though we did try originally). We overhauled the paladin class for Lich King, so it is unfortunate but not too surprising that the numbers for the dps spec require a lot of iteration. The mistake is ours, not the fault of the player base or beta testers.<br />
<br />
Nerfing a spec or class is never fun. It means that our initial estimates of numbers were off and we know that the community is going to react negatively (to put it mildly). But we have to try and keep the game in a relatively balanced state and that is going to mean making decisions that are unpopular sometimes. If you need to blame someone for the nerfs, blame me.<br />
<br />
As always, if we over-compensated, we'll adjust the numbers again. But as I said, our initial round of nerfs wasn't sufficient. Lest you fear that Lich King is upon as and you won't see any additional changes, that is not our point of view. We changed a lot in the game and we need to be able to rectify problems. I would expect early patches or even hotfixes to deal with class or balance problems, and hopefully these will slow down as we get closer to major content releases. But nothing is off the table after we ship, down to rearchitecting talent trees if we think that is called for. This isn't to suggest we aren't happy with the state of the game. Rather, my word that we will continue to iterate on problem areas as they come up.<br />
<br />
I also want to stress that we do not make balance decisions based on the QQ of other classes. At most, if there is a pretty vocal outcry that will encourage us to rerun the numbers to see if something is amiss. As vocal, and sometimes passionate and even logical as forum posts can be, they represent a fraction of the entire fanbase and it would be foolish for us to clobber one group of players solely based on the whining from another group.<br />
<br />
Go ahead and vent if you have to. We won't delete posts or ban posters in this thread unless they are overly offensive. We do ask that you not launch a thousand other threads so that other paladin issues can still be discussed. Likewise, we have no problem with other classes engaging in the discussion but outright gloating or trolling will be frowned upon.<br />
<br />
And I do apologize for putting you through this. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Retribution nerfs in the latest beta build - Part II<br />
I know many of you asked good questions before the posts hit their limit. I am not convinced that my answering many of these questions would calm anyone down, but I'll give it a shot. If not, when the paladin community has gotten it all out of their system, I'll still be here.<br />
<br />
Also realize that there are probably a couple hundred questions at this point and I can't answer them all. Here are a few common themes:<br />
<br />
I thought we were supposed to be bursty?<br />
Yes, that's the design. It's also a tough design to nail because if you're too bursty the opponent doesn't even get to respond.<br />
<br />
You reviewed our class last because you don't care.<br />
We overhauled the entire class. We rebuilt the way Seals and Judgements work, and by and large it's a good change. Paladins got a lot of attention for Lich King. your response suggests to me that the correct way to balance the game in the future is to make a class terrible early on and then buff it so that players are happy and excited instead of fuming and disappointed. Trajectory is everything.<br />
<br />
I thought you didn't want us to run out of mana.<br />
We didn't want you to run out of mana in three hits, especially in a sustained dps fight. What we don't want is for a paladin to kill someone and move on to the next enemy without losing any mana. I'm a little surprised so many people deny this was going on or that it was a problem.<br />
<br />
We think we have your mana in a good place now, but mana is one of those aspects of the game that requires a lot of adjustment and there are many classes right now who would still like us to further review how mana is working for their class. If you're running out of mana too fast, believe me, we'll hear about it and we'll adjust it if we weren't &quot;surgical&quot; enough this time around.<br />
<br />
But we don't care about Battlegrounds.<br />
A lot of people do care. And if you don't care about them right now, I'll warrant that's because they don't offer the rewards that Arenas or raiding do. This is something we want to address in the future.<br />
<br />
Again, though, we think Ret was out of line in several situations. Other classes are OP in some situations too, and we have either recently nerfed them or are still discussing how we want to address those classes as well.<br />
<br />
Look at all the other classes in here laughing at us.<br />
Well, they're jerks. Many of them probably suspect they are OP too and have so far escaped the nerfbat. So far. We want Retribution to be a dangerous class to go up against. We don't want to see BGs with 30 Retadins on one side, which is actually something we were seeing. Yeah, I know it sucks that people say Lolet. It sucks when people say huntards too. That doesn't drive people away from playing either class. We're always going to have some amount of competition in this game, either directly in PvP or the damage race in PvE. If I can read 1200 angry posts from Ret pallies today, you can blow off some inane gloating from warlocks or warriors. We delete the trolling comments when we see them.<br />
<br />
Why didn't we compensate Holy and Protection first?<br />
We want Holy to have better dps than it did in BC, but that's a secondary consideration compared to them being good at healing (which we believe they are). We are also still committed to Protection being able to tank anything that a warrior can. Consider that the boss armor changes hurts warrior threat more than it does paladin threat. The net result should hopefully come out equal. So far I'm not aware of a boss fight in the game where a paladin MT struggles. As I said, though, this is something we're working on right now.<br />
<br />
Why did I describe our initial attempts to nerf Ret as surgical?<br />
Because that's what we tried to do. In retrospect, we were so worried about nerfing Ret too much that we ended up not fixing the problem. We should have done more sweeping changes initially.<br />
<br />
Why did we say Ret was fine for so long?<br />
Because we didn't want to have to nerf the spec. Ret players were having fun. We thought and hoped that some well publicized bugs were to blame for the excess damage. As I've said, if I wait to post until we're absolutely 100% certain, you're just not going to get as many posts. Many posters have said they appreciate getting occasional developer communication and insight. But that is going to come with some risk that things are going to change. As I said, I'll caveat it more in the future.<br />
<br />
That you're somehow paying to beta test the game.<br />
First, I don't really think we'll ever get game balance to a state where 90% of you would say &quot;Yes, it's perfect! Don't touch a thing!&quot; Second, it's an MMO. Things change. The game evolves. We are always going to be changing things on our end as well. Players would be just as happy as not enough changes as some of you are with too many changes.<br />
<br />
You may also have noticed that we nerfed level 70 raiding and that the level 80 raids are pretty easy compared to our past instances. We wanted to make sure we weren't shining too harsh a light on balance differences until everyone had plenty of time to get used to the changes -- more time than even our large beta can offer. Nobody should get parked at the curb in Naxx, and by the time Ulduar and later instances come on line, I predict we will have made many balance changes.<br />
<br />
We don't believe you because we've been at the bottom of the barrel before.<br />
There's not much I can do to get you to believe me or not. I try to be honest so my words carry some weight, but I also try to joke around a little so you know I don't take myself too seriously. I don't know how many other ways to say that it sucks that your PvE wasn't competitive in BC or that you weren't a major Arena force. That's not where we wanted you to end up and not where we want you to end up this time. I'm not going to show you my daily tasks or how I spend my time so that you can oversee my progress and make sure it doesn't happen again. Sorry. The best thing you can do is point out situations where you're struggling so we can investigate. Most of you haven't even had a chance to test with these changes yet.<br />
<br />
You're nerfing paladins because of PvP.<br />
Read my initial post again. Ret PvE dps was also too high.<br />
<br />
Our numbers are different from yours.<br />
That's going to happen. We compare data when we can. I think you'd agree that the game balance would be pretty interesting if we automatically made adjustments whenever anyone suggested them.<br />
<br />
You said I wouldn't get banned.<br />
You're still going to get banned for explicit language, death threats or the like (thank you very much for those BTW). Try and make your point without resorting to text that will violate the posting regulations. Call me a jerk, if it will make you feel better. It boggles my mind that I actually need to point out that AIDS comments and the like aren't appropriate. If you're smart enough to raid or do Arenas on your character, you're smart enough to know how to make an intelligent post.<br />
<br />
Added one more for clarification:<br />
<br />
You only tested in Naxx, but paladins do bonus damage against undead.<br />
Yes, we know that. We tested under a lot of different situations with and without undead and with different levels of gear and buffs present. I use Patchwerk as an example a lot because players understand that it is a very simple boss fight in which there is no running around, adds or damage to the raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements update<br />
Something I didn't have the time to report earlier.<br />
In an effort to improve performance, in the next minor patch, we will be removing the “Attributes” section found under “Character” of the “Statistics” tab found in the Achievement system. While this could be made available again at some point in the future, there are currently no plans to do so.<br />
<br />
We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause, and we appreciate your understanding.</div></div><hr />

Its to improve game performance just think everytime someones stats changes it has to send an update to the server and client to track it.<br />
<br />
Think how many times your stats changes during a raid for example from buffs/debuffs/even abilities that change it) now times that by 10/25 that's alot just in your raid and then also everyone else on your realm that's a pretty large chunk of data to track</div></div><hr />

I kind of expected the big events to take place during the weekend. It seems a bit lame to me to add an event as important as the razing of a capital city on a monday night :P. Or perhaps the cities will be constantly under siege for a couple of days? Like Stormwind this week and Org next week (only SW is foggy so I'm inclined to think that it could be a hint towards its imminent doom).</div></div><hr />

not sure on Shadowmoon since org is to packed cant even walk without being turning into a zombie ;D but i did Lady Sylvannas say something about attacking the scourge when i walked by her room in UC i wonder if there planning a way to retake the cities :D epic fight with all the bosses completely destorying all the zombie invaders in the towns would be epic</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really seems what Blizzard are trying to do is to decrease the loading. As at the moment, half of the people - those who find some fun in playing zombies for more than 20 minutes - having their time while others just logged off until it is over.<br />
Game is made unplayable and weekend is ruined for half of the players. People who selected to play on PVE servers to decide themselves when they want PVP and when - not - are forced to PVP all the time. Low levels cannot play at all. <br />
<br />
Thanks to the bug I personally have one of my character stacked as a dead zomby in the inn - and I didn't do anything - just left him there - and now when I am logging, I am immediately got disconnected. I have logged from another account and comp with the char at the same place - dead zombie appears on the floor and than disappears when I am trying to log this char.<br />
<br />
And to be honest, when I see people who discussing how fun it was to infect orphanage and have all the kids there turned to zombie, I don't enjoy it at all. I hope this idiotic event would come to it ends soon enough as at the moment I am closer to canceling my 4 accounts as I never was before.</div></div><hr />

Now the ret community is crying and saying how unfair it is that we are getting nerfed. Any hardcore raider or pvper knew this was due as soon as we started out dpsing 4piec t6 dps classes in kara gear rofl. Or in pvp, when you just double stunned full brut classes and let off all our cds until they were melted. Ill admit there really was no skill involved when it came to pvp, if you were dumb enough to let me get to you, then you were dead, not saying at all that was fair. Just very enjoyable rofl rofl. So stop crying ret, now we actually have to have skill to play our class to be above other players. i dont see the problem with that. The only ret players qqing now are the ones that were never good to begin with in my eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlocks took a MAJOR pve nerf, and as someone who raids hardcore PvE it's a shame, but lets face it, we were top DPS on aoe fights, top dps on straight nuke fights (competing with rogues sometimes).<br />
<br />
Admit your class was OP. Warlocks have been nerfed too, but its trying to balance it.<br />
<br />
And the thing that annoys me most out of all this whine, is you can't see it was deserved. <br />
<br />
Yes ret pala's were low dps TBC, and you complain? FFS, you can spec tank, you can spec heal, you can spec dps. Seems just you guys want an &quot;I.W.I.N.&quot; button. <br />
<br />
A lot of other classes can't do sweet FA apart from DPS. Warlocks, Rogues, Mages, Hunters. Those classes should be top. Shamans, priests, druids, paladins, should be near the bottom.<br />
<br />
The paladin nerf was deserved. <br />
<br />
So was the warlocks, unfortunately for myself.<br />
<br />
Blizz got it right. Now they just need to nerf that bloody new Prot Warrior talent and we're set ;)</div></div><hr />

We miss something to interrupt with! With these changes we do not deal more dmg, we can't outheal any dps, only postpone our death and we can still be kited (all you have to do is run if we use Hand of Freedom or bubble).<br />

All in all, it is a clear message to the Paladin community that one class has to be last, and it's going to be the Paladin class.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what they do in the short few weeks, it's lolret all over again and I for one am not going to stick around for this ill-fated class with the ill-mannered balancing fixes.<br />
<br />
Ret Paladins most likely lost their theorycraft raid spot due to oominess and thus damage loss.<br />
Holy Paladins lost nearly all hope there ever was of having a somewhat enjoyable time doing dailies. For reference, before these damage nerfs they already had the lowest damage out of all healers.<br />
Prot Paladins lost threat generation and utility.<br />
<br />
It's a completely nerf to all Paladin specs, even though it hits Retribution hardest.<br />

Not surprising since it's your class, too bad half of the playerbase has the &quot;single-player mentality&quot;, where &quot;I&quot; of course am supposed to beat everyone easily.<br />
<br />
Easy to assume, isn't it, child?<br />
<br />
&quot;I&quot; don't care much for PvP. As long as I don't have to feel like I'm struggling to even stay in the game the way it felt like 2.3.0 and before, it's all good for &quot;me&quot;.<br />
Let me educate you why Paladins do so much burst in PvP: Seals proc on Crusader Strikes and Divine Storm. The whole mess is because of damage seals, because each time a Paladin activates a yellow-damage ability you risk not only getting hit by one attack but four! <br />
That's, for example, Crusader Strike, Seal of Command on that, auto-attack, and Seal of Command on that again. In one GCD, it needs to be spread.<br />
<br />
&quot;I&quot; care about PvE. Raids and everything around them, preparation especially. All reports I've seen of Paladins, all damage logs I've seen of Paladins, indicate nothing other than that Paladin dps was average prior to the proposed changes (and that all damage dealing measurements at level 70 is beyond ridiculously silly). And this even before the armour increase on bosses.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the person mentioning &quot;change mind due to new data&quot;. There is no real new data. The 3.0.2 patch was released based on mostly theoretical data. The 3.0.3 patch contains a sweeping dps decrease on all physical damage, and this hasn't been tested any more than 3.0.2, meaning the changes are *still* based on theoretical data since previous test data can only be considered outdated due to the previously mentioned armour increase.<br />
<br />
And, still, the biggest travesty is that Holy Paladins were promised a dps increase since currently soloing is little more than a masochistic pursuit when compared to any other spec of any other class. And they got a dps decrease.</div></div><hr />

I am happy to admit that in PvP we will destroy stuff fast and something did need to be done, but the flat PvE nerf that is coming with this is also going to be immence with to little to compensate, which is what annoys me when tbh i couldnt give a shit about PvP and there are alot of other Ret pallys that feel the same way.<br />
<br />
PvP is only 1 side of the game, dont base all nerfs and buffs on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Strange thing, cause your stats shows you as a PVPer (6% hit - 18k HKs)<br />
<br />
Anyway, we should split this thread in two... mixing paly nerf with zombies doesnt have any sense... well, maybe it does.</div></div><hr />

Now the ret community is crying and saying how unfair it is that we are getting nerfed. Any hardcore raider or pvper knew this was due as soon as we started out dpsing 4piec t6 dps classes in kara gear rofl. Or in pvp, when you just double stunned full brut classes and let off all our cds until they were melted. Ill admit there really was no skill involved when it came to pvp, if you were dumb enough to let me get to you, then you were dead, not saying at all that was fair. Just very enjoyable rofl rofl. So stop crying ret, now we actually have to have skill to play our class to be above other players. i dont see the problem with that. The only ret players qqing now are the ones that were never good to begin with in my eyes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Wow im amazed another gamer in wow community like me that knows that games should be skill and everyone should be equal and skill should make diffrence not overpowerness :)</div></div><hr />

I'd say it makes more sense than ever.<br />

All this crying about Retribution makes my brain feel like a zombies from reading it all.<br />
<br />
Just face it people, Blizzard have worked on Paladins (especially Retribution) for over 3 years and they still fail.<br />
<br />
Logout, press &quot;create a new character&quot;, pick the &lt;insert other class than paladin here&gt;-class, give it a name, start leveling, be happy.<br />

Edit<br />
I started out as a Paladin February '05 gave the class about 90 days played. Today I regret all of those days spent on the Paladin-class. Today I'm a happy Shadow Priest.</div></div><hr />

That is the biggest BS ever.<br />
<br />
A good BM hunter should be out dpsing a ret pally. EASILY.<br />
And I'm in beta and have very good gear. 3/5 t7 and all epic off pieces. I usually top dps on undead bosses (such as KT) but non-undead bosses a hunter is likely to be on top (if he doesn't have down syndrome), with me not far behind (maybe 100 dps difference if it's even that)</div></div><hr />

So, blizzard nerfing the DPS of the healing class/spec that is currently doing the least dmg of all healing classes/specs doesn't seem harsh to you?<br />
Maybe your solution to the problem is to nerf the rest of the healing spec down to same low dps? How about getting a healer for WotLK instances then - when no classes wanna spec healing at all since they wanna be viable for leveling without banging their head against the wall?<br />

<br />
It really seems what Blizzard are trying to do is to decrease the loading. As at the moment, half of the people - those who find some fun in playing zombies for more than 20 minutes - having their time while others just logged off until it is over.<br />
Game is made unplayable and weekend is ruined for half of the players. People who selected to play on PVE servers to decide themselves when they want PVP and when - not - are forced to PVP all the time. Low levels cannot play at all. <br />
<br />
Thanks to the bug I personally have one of my character stacked as a dead zomby in the inn - and I didn't do anything - just left him there - and now when I am logging, I am immediately got disconnected. I have logged from another account and comp with the char at the same place - dead zombie appears on the floor and than disappears when I am trying to log this char.<br />
<br />
And to be honest, when I see people who discussing how fun it was to infect orphanage and have all the kids there turned to zombie, I don't enjoy it at all. I hope this idiotic event would come to it ends soon enough as at the moment I am closer to canceling my 4 accounts as I never was before. <br />
<br />
<br />
nice... then we dont have to hear on your whining anymore...<br />

Infidels! Blasphemy! How can a zombie infestation be &quot;Fun&quot; or &quot;enjoyable&quot;?<br />

It's supposed to be thrilling, you are supposed to hate freakin zombies, thats what Blizz tries to do... hate the Lich King so bad that you want to go to Northrend to fight him in revenge!<br />

<br />
no that's not balanced, but this nerfwagon that is coming is just kill the ret spec. i mean why the fuck do they change JotW ? so we go oom after a few seconds again? no INT on ret gear in the future? ye QQers this sure is balancing our class. our burst needs to be lessened and dmg in general, but dont take our mana regen for the love of god! <br />
i read the forums and i must say fuck all of those resto druids and warriors that QQ about arena. ye your the right ones to tell us. nerf arcane mages, resto druids, warriors and then talk about a freakin balance.<br />

But did they have to lower all seals? I don't see the point in reducing the damage from most of our seals since a ret wouldn't even use it in the first place. I know they said that if prot's threat became too much lower they would fix it... so why don't they just leave our seal alone. I just won't complain about my poor brother's holy pally's ability to do damage.<br />
<br />
I'll just assume they aimed too high. So now they aim too low to find some middle ground for the new balancing act.</div></div><hr />

Why are you complaining about the banks?? you don't need bank all the time, it's not the point of the game to love the bank and there are 5 towns with banks. I go to exodar or darnassus : noone. nothing. Darnassus ? I saw one zombie. I took my potions and went outside, doing quests against the scourge, or daily quests or raids. <br />

Or I can also fight the zombiiiiies and treacherous player trying to infect small towns, or to fight the headless horseman and his burnings<br />

Only Priests and Paladins have holy spells for healing and damage. Priests never did much dps with holy, they were just barely able to do dailys and stuff with their healing spec. So no priests aren't getting nerfed, only paladins (and rightfully so).<br />
<br />
And no you won't need a healing specced healer for leveling instances in Lich King. You didn't need for BC. I healed every instance with my shadow priest while leveling just fine.</div></div><hr />

You miss the point. Holy Paladins total damage per second for dailies is lower than Holy Priests total damage per second for dailies. Before the nerfs. And the nerf hit Holy Paladin down to an even lower level, meaning even slower dailies.</div></div><hr />

I was not number 1 on the damage meters so everyone can suck my balls, this nerf is bullshit for pve because pve is balanced NOW. I stayed in the top 5 dps all night, which is where I should be in the gear I have compared to the raiders I was with. Though last night in kara a warrior with nearly identical stats as me wtfpwned my dps by 500 all night. And we're getting what's going to end up as a 25-40% dps nerf?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shinenzyme</div><div class="date">2008-10-27, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My viewpoint on the pally nerf, given I have both a 70 pally and several other 70's (one of which is my main, a resto druid). Since I play multiple classes, thought I'd at least try to make a balanced argument FWiW (sorry if it's a bit of a novel and mainly pve focussed) :p<br />
<br />
Yes, ret pallies were clearly overpowered, I saw that the first time I tried my pally on thr PTR. Yes it was presumably annoying in pvp (when I had a friendly duel with a mate it was somewhat onesided). However some other classes are clearly a bit overpowered atm too (hunters and feral druids at least afaik).<br />
<br />
One thing to bear in mind when you're looking at ret pallies though is that they basically don't have any real dps talents to get 71-80, nor do they get any new dps abilities 71-80 (a mana regen ability (like innervate, etc), a shield that helps your heals crit and shield slam for prot), so what you're basically seeing at 70 is an 80 ret pally without the gear or extra stats from 10 more levels. So whilst the mages will have Mirror Image, and the Shammies Lava Burst, Hex, etc, Ret will basically be the same, with the same extremely basic attack rotation which makes each nerf to individual attacks hurt that much more.<br />
<br />
The first set of nerfs seemed reasonable, Blizzard assured us they didn't want ret to be as plainly awful as it was pre-3.02, just to lower burst damage, so they nerf that (Art of War, Righteous Vengence, between them were approx +45% to crit damage) and nerf Repentance (stun) in pvp.<br />
<br />
However, on top of that, they've now taken 20% dmg off all seals, nerfed Hammer of Wrath back to being only useable 20% of health (why did they even leave it at 35% outside beta, given that their stated baseline is 20% of health staggers me) and halved the mana regen (it *was* too high, but 50% might be a bit too much, time will tell). This gives ret a fairly huge nerf (last one I can think of this big is when they took the hammer to druids just after TBC was released) and also fairly severely hurts the other specs.<br />
<br />
The real issue here imo, is not pallies QQing about being nerfed into the floor or being as poor as they were pre 3.02, nor other classes QQing about pallies owning them in the BGs/Arena (something that will hurt them more given the stigma ret pallies suffer), but simply &quot;why did blizzard not see that pallies on beta seemed to need such a HUGE nerf?&quot; (basically 45% of crit dmg, 20% of overall dps, 50% of mana regen - how do you miss that if you even bother to test at all?)...the pally changes shouldn't ever have gone live, as now ret pallies are either &quot;loladins&quot;, etc, or &quot;those %*$@$ who kept beating me in pvp for 3wks pre LK going live and got a deserved nerfing&quot;...great.<br />
<br />
My final point: To the people saying &quot;zomg, hybrid classes can heal/tank, all I can do is DPS - so they should have lower dps&quot;. Isn't this the whole reason why a lot of hybrid specs have been kept out of groups? Blizzard stated they wanted to raise Hybrid dps from 70% of parent class to about 95%. And yes, whilst these classes can do other things, they also don't have core abilities you do - so they either have smaller attack rotations, less flexibility or lack of emergency skills, etc. Assuming Blizzard ever balance it properly.</div></div><hr />

Im saying this as a plate class.<br />
The diference between them is that a lower level pally - less than 70 - with leveling gear can burst for more than some lvl 70 AND geared classes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timberleaf</div><div class="date">2008-10-27, 01:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off all, I must express particular disapointment at the fact these 3topics have been lumped in together. As a retr pally that is interested in hearing the view and arguments over the proposed nurf the last thing I care about is the stupid zombie crap. The changes to my class are going to effect every aspec of my play over the next year, it really is inappropriate that it should be carelessly lobbed in with something which is so irrelevent.<br />
<br />
I totally agree with blizz that at this stage, at level 70 Ret is imbal. However, lets for a secon think about things rationally,, (god-forbid blizz) as a lvl70 ret pally I have ALL MY DPS ENHANCING SKILLS, I can stick a few more points here and there but nothing particularly major. Lets compare this with for example warriors, who at lvl80 will be able to pick up titans grip and the 2H weapon specialisation from the arms tree. Iv looked at a few other chars as well, and this seems to be the case for other classes too, though im no expert on locks or rogues. <br />
<br />
I really dont understand why retri has to be nurf so hard, in 1 go??? why not try incremental dps nurfs and see what happens. Ret pallies have been the laughing stock of every other class in the game for far too long... I pay the same monthly charge as everyone else,, why the hell should my play experience be less of any other class, based on a decision I made within 10mins of installing the game. If our dps is terrible it makes for difficult leveling and it makes it very difficult to get into a party and as for a raid spot......<br />
<br />
I really cant understand,, if your gonna nurf our dps so hard, why take away our functionally as mana batteries as well??? Surely I have a justified right to play the game as I wish and raid without blizz's changes causing me to be shunned, laughted at and ridiculed by other players???<br />
<br />
Iv been a healer and tank in my time, but healing came down to press FoL and was so boaring I wanted to carve out my own eyes and though tanking was fun, when it came to raiding the warriors were always chosen for tanking the big bosses as pallies have a sever lack of defensive skills (such as critical blocks etc). Iv not seen a change in this situation with the WoTlK talents.<br />
<br />
It seems that these nurfs have been brought in due to moans and groans from pvpers and is a total knee jerk reaction. I never play pvp, i have no interest in pvp and dont understand why my game play is so affected by this same aspect of the game. tbh if people want to prove themselves in a pvp envirionment then there are games out there that ARE balanced counterstrike etc...so ruining an essentially pve team game for this tiny aspect. <br />
<br />
Or as I suspect are you so worried about players leaving for Warhammer that your bending over backwards for the pvpers? Can blue please explain why retri has to be the bottom of the dps, with little or no hope of competing with similarly geared other dps classes??? Because thats what your doing to us and I really dont understand why????<br />
<br />
Feels like pvpers are so used to being able to laught at ret and piss all over them that they really cant handle the fact that we were actually able to fight back for what 2weeks?????<br />
<br />
The truth is blizz, all you've achieved by this complete turn around is showing the pally comminity how much we've had to suffer over the entire duration of TBC and given us a taste of what it would be like to actually be on an even playing field for once. I dont think I can go back to being the crappest char in the game and I certainly wont be re-rolling. I'v been running two accounts for nearly 3years now, I love wow, I use it to meet my mates from back home who i dont get the chance to meet often and have made loads of new friends through it, but i really feel like your forcing me out.<br />

IMO you guys that are playing retri loladins need to take a reality check and look at it this way - If Blizz suddenly made warriors/mages/locks or any other class apart from palas overpowered how would you feel if you kept getting raped in BG's. get a grip guys, wake up and smell the coffee - Blizz is only making the game fair for all classes - if you dont like it then all I can say is go play AoC or WAR.<br />
<br />
You're missing the point completely. The DPS-nerfs are justified, the mana-nerf is way too significant. The essence of the QQ/drama is about the mana problems we'll be having at 80. 15% of base mana back when judging may be fine when we're all level 70 with intellect on our gear, but it's no where near enough once we reach 80, and 33% may have been to much. That's why most of us are asking for something like 25%.<br />
<br />
I'm seeing lots of comments saying the nerf is needed, but this is NOT the way to do it.<br />
<br />
Another problem is that they're going 2.0 all over again. Nerf us based on level 60 QQ, and realize it was wrong a year after. Almost all paladins remember it, and it seems they're the only ones who does, because Blizzard doesn't seem to have learned anything at all from it.</div></div><hr />

because since the release of TBC we've had the lowest dps of all chars, to be given so much and then have it taken away is truely heart breaking. I dont think theres a single pally out there that wants to be imbal,, we just want to be on a fair playing field with everyone else.

You Sir, don't understand what base mana means. It's the mana you have without any intellect on you. It only depends on your level.<br />
<br />
Base mana for Paladin at lvl70 is 2953. JotW gives 443 mana.<br />
Base mana for Paladin at lvl80 is 4394. JotW gives 659 mana.<br />
<br />
So if 15% is fine at lvl70, it will be fine at lvl80 because you will gain as much mana as you will lose because of higher ability cost. The amount of intellect on the gear has nothing to do in this conversation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
dmg got nerfed cause it was WAY more then other classes<br />
<br />
i saw 1k DPS difference between me(shadowpriest with near best gear) and a ret paladin with near equal good gear on our last kil jeaden fight<br />
<br />
imho...that .... and other number justifies a dps nerf<br />
<br />
for mana regen the 50% nerf is good too cause ret paladins are generating WAY!!!!! more mana too raid then a Shadowpriest<br />
<br />
<br />
Judgement of Wisdom: mana gained reduced to 1% of maximum mana and proc frequency cut by 50%. This ability was flat out better than Vampiric Touch when the mana provided between the two really needs to be close in order for the decision between Shadow priest and Retribution paladin to be a real one.<br />
<br />
imho even now its still WAY more then that of a shadowpriest<br />
0,25% of max mana.....</div></div><hr />

Ok season 4 has arrived well 4 s4 could get easy and pretty thats all!<br />
After pach i look arround me and i see myself and 2 more paladins on server who got shoulders and ,me after 300 games (lag ...), since that day we are still only us 3 palas with s4 shoulders and we didnt get any nerf ...if i look closer i see 10 hunters, 10 warriors, over 15 druids and few warlocks and rogues (this classes are top pvp ,and allways was ).I understand a class who got way OP CC not dooing so much dmg still arcane mages are insane and hunters, but apart from all, balance druids was way OP helping in dealing so much dmg and healing at same time plus CC.I'm just saying this as long a class like us doesn't have any CC for spam ,realy slow effect on a target and we go oom by dps something ..will never be fair . Tip: as a warrior rage comes and go but we are oom after 4 minutes , please look at a 15 minutes fight and see , at least that shouldnt get nerfed and give back no GCD on judgement!</div></div><hr />

I know what base mana is, and I also know that more intellect means it'll take longer for you to run OOM. What I meant was not that every paladin wants us to have unlimited mana, we just don't want to run OOM in the first couple of minutes. The &quot;Blue Rage Bar&quot; is fine if we're allowed to have it, but if not then please let us last more than a minute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, we generate too much mana? Well, lower the god damn manareturn then, not the procrate of it. I would prefer a steady flow of mana over bursts.<br />
<br />
Too much burst? Yes we have, but it wouldn't be that bad if they just removed all those stupid &quot;1 million damage bonus that allways crit when the target is stunned/incapacitated&quot; part on skills instead of keeping it and nerfing everything else.<br />
<br />
So you are balacing the entire class around Nax? Yeah, that's like really smart, considering paladin is a anti-undead class. These changes will probably nerf the retri paladin too much on normal encounters like against dragonkins, humanoids, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
And like some people are saying, why are they doing so massive changes? Why not change this skill and that skill and see what happens instead of reworking everything, discovere they fucked up and have to redo like 75% of the changes they did in the first place?</div></div><hr />

I have been ret since the games started and only specced out of ret to raid sothat I could get more ret gear. So if I can be reasonable about this so can all the holy and prot palies that specced into their free ride. That said nerfing prot and holy when trying to nerf ret was.. confusing at best and handled wrong in my opinion so don't flame me for that.<br />
<br />
Divine storm doing holy dmg.... wow.....we killed the hell out of everything. So that HAD to go. It was a bit of fun while it lasted, but it was a needed nerf. I am disturbed by the nerf to nearly every dmg ability we have. I will test it before freaking out, but I can't see how it won't really change things past the point of balance.<br />
<br />
I feel like the community backlash comes from three things.<br />
1)Ret was OP<br />
2)Ret used to not be OP or even viable at all so the transition was spectaculr and hard not to notice. <br />
3)People don't like ret. It has been a whipping boy spec for years now and being beaten by a &quot;Retard&quot; was offensive to people.<br />
<br />
I think if ret had been put out perfectly balanced the &quot;nerf ret&quot; outcry would have still been very loud. I have a desire that all race/class/specs be viable in raid and casual play and pvp. I am aware that this will not happen, but I feel that it is something that a developer should strive for. Ret did suck in PvE and PvP for a long time (initial release of Crus Strike and of course recent events being the times this was not the case) and it is a valid concern that we will hit 80and be lol ret both in raids and PvP. A lot of people say play something different, which makes sense for some people, but some people (not very many honestly) are very serious about the spec. Personally it is one of the few ways I have any fun at all with the game. I love being a paladin and hate tanking and healing. Make fun of it if you want, but that makes changing a very unattractive option.<br />
<br />
Now just a few things ret palies (I mean &quot;real&quot; ret palies as in you were ret BEFORE the patch and not in anticipation of the patch) just give it a shot before freaking out... at least in public (internet public I suppose). Fake ret, I'm sorry your real spec got nerf beacause we were OP, but complain about the nerfs YOUR spec recieved and get off the band wagon you aren't a part of. There is more than enough ret crying going on without fake ret adding in. I will be playing ret whether the fix it or not and will take it all in stride if you are serious about ret you will too. Everyone with the mmm ret tears (I know I'm reaching out to trolls, but as long as I'm addressing everyone) seriously we have had it rough and have valid complaints let it go. The whining is dumb, but a normal rational person shouldn't have to taunt and injured (if whiny) party.<br />
<br />
As to Blizz, if Ghostcrawler is to be believed (and he seems sincere enough) they made a mistake and may have over adjusted in response. I hope they will pay close attension to what they changed and make it right. Their intensions were not cruel and they have offred an apology which I don't recall any other mmo company doing ever. I honestly think we will be below the curve, but I will wait and see and I hope you put us where we belong, which is balanced with all our pros and cons weighted against our enemies (PvE and PvP).<br />
<br />
Last to both hardcore ret players and either our new brothers or even you who jumped onfor the OP ride: Instead of looking at this buff and then nerf as a cruel taunt just say it was fun while it lasted (especially you who jumped on for power.... I mean its all you really wanted in the first place and you got it). I had a lot of fun stomping around battlegrounds and getting a decent arena rating, I wouldn't want it forever, but a little OP was fun (little as in time spen not as in we were only a tiny bit OP).<br />
<br />
Anyways flame away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was with you up until here. Stop playing the &quot;poor me&quot; victim card pallies. Seriously. Every class has had this happen before and you guys whining that you are the whipping boy is just pitiful. <br />
<br />
Ret was overpowered and they should have taken care of it earlier, but this is how the cookie crumbles. If you dont like it, play something different. <br />
<br />
Personally I believe that you play a class the way that its supposed to be played, not tailoring the class to your whims, otherwise why have classes? To me druids and paladins are more middle of the line damage and are supposed to be healers primarily, same with priests. Meanwhile mages and rogues cant heal but are supposed to be doing spectacular dps. To be screaming to be able to do the same amount of damage as a pure dps class is just plain selfish, stupid and overall idiotic. <br />
<br />
Personally I play a shaman and I'm ok with the class. I'm enhancement (the only one in my guild, lol, the rest are healing and elemental) and I dont expect to be meeting up to a good rogue, but I'm happy with what I bring to the table. Retardins should be the same, I say retardins now because of all the screaming, you guys bring great buffs, good dps so be happy with what you are.<br />
<br />
You wont be able to two shot warlocks anymore, but you'll be important to any decent guild. We have two or three retadins in our guild that we love, they are bummed by the latest changes but they arent whining. We consider them to be invaluable to our progress, as long as a class and spec are played well you'll be wanted.<br />
<br />
The ones screaming that this makes ret paladins useless are the ones that cant play anyway.<br />
<br />
1) Victim card doesnt work for you, stop playing it.<br />
2) You were OP, now you're not. Hopefully they buff you a little now to help.<br />
3) Its a game, get over it.</div></div><hr />

I am a little disappointed in most people's reactions to this. We are actually being allowed to participate in part of the plot of the game. I think that so much of the lore has already taken place that, as players, we are basically living in our own constant &quot;Cavern of time&quot; in game. Our quests have been done and redone. This makes a lot of this game &quot;easy&quot; and &quot;safe.&quot; I play on a PVE server - I don't wish to be ganked while I am trying to do my dailies, but this is different. The storyline is unfolding in front you as you play. If you find the zombies annoying, fight them, protect your faction leaders, defend lower levels from their wrath, but at least appreciate the fact that you are being involved with what is actually happening in the HERE and NOW ingame. Conceptually, It is one of the coolest things I have seen ingame because you CAN'T just ignore it and go out and do your dailies. I think game creators want the players to experience the true evil behind the Litch King. This is their way of showing you exactly how bad ass he is before the expansion. <br />
<br />
But the sad truth is, is that this is change. Level 70 toons who have been playing the same way for over a year and are going to at the very least have to take a break from their raiding to level are going to have a hard time dealing. I expect for a while, it may seem like it isn't any fun, but if you log out until the expansion, think about how much you will miss. AND logging will not make the new changes ingame any easier to deal with when they come.<br />
<br />
I just think that a lot of the complaining is due to the fact that people can't do their same old routine in the same old way. Stop your routine. The world is on fire. Thrall and Tyrande won't make it without your help. Be a part of the action and PLAY.<br />

I play WoW since day one i started with a troll Mage on Medive one of the oldest server there is. With BC i decided to roll a paladin.<br />
He was dam hard to lvl compare to other classes i have ( mage rogue druid ). At lvl 60 i farmed up all of lightforged and pvp gear i could and started to play AV and it was fun till they git nerfed the first time. then i lvled to 61 and was healing for 3 years during BC. i allwasy tried to get back as ret but it was weak and worthless you get like not one group in the game with a ret pala at all. So i was stuck with healing which is not bad but boring over the time. So i put a lot of time and work into my PVP ret gear for lvl 70 and now finally done and happy. my dmg in a 5 man group before the 3.0 patch would never ever pass 500 to 700 no matter what buff or food windfury ect. moreover in pvp there was like no class you could def kill or kill at all cause the dmg was not enough to kill anything without help!!<br />
Then i played the ptr and the burst dmg was insane cause of divien strom beeing holy dmg. i was able to kill anything in 2v2 scirmisch by myself. But then when the patch came live they things changed fast. everyone was complainig about palas burst and so on. evenn so all my other 70 have no problem whatsoever to take a Ret paladin out ( Mage rogue druid ) in fact my buddies S4 feral druid can kill my paladin in under 3 sec and i am not kidding i dueled him 60 times in a row and had 60 losses. when i bubbled he ran of stealthed and stunlocked me to death and his dmg is same insane as a mages one. <br />
<br />
Today i was reading that paladins and only paladins get nerfed again!! <br />
so dear Blizz if my palas DPS drops under 1k in 5 man groups again i am going to have a GM take my gear and give them to a poor kid and stop palying WOW. I cant explain or help others to see that palas are not even cose to being OP a ok geard prot Tank can kill a pala. And Tanks wont get nerfed with there endless wirl of doom which crits more than divine storm ever could. and a tip for any winning rogue USE dismantel and the pala is dead. and to all the poor mages that are used to die and get killed form anyone you can KITE palas and all there burst is useless. <br />
<br />
SO please dont nerf palas and let them have at least once the dps so they get taken to a raid or group. <br />
<br />
In addition have you read the nerf list its like <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
that long and it will hurt all other specs tremendous like holy or prot in prot palas already lost 12 def rating just like that which is ......<br />
and i raid daily and i am not the DPS OP god in a group like everyone complaints rogues and mages and warlocks are still on top so why are you nerfing them when they were just good were they are??<br />
<br />
I dont care about the hammer be only be castable at 20 % thats fine but 20% minus dmg on judgments is stupid.<br />
If i log on on wednesday and warrior and mages and druids come to roflpwn any pala again i am seriously done! <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Agreed, however I do agree with blizzards intention to increase that percentage damage of a pure dps class (what happened to having a sliding scale of dps classes anyway, with mage/rogue at the top?)...if you're dps spec on a hybrid, who's gonna take you anywhere except for buffs/utility if you're doing 50-70% of a &quot;pure&quot; dps classes damage, hence the increase.<br />
<br />
However we shouldn't be above a pure dps class on a meter imo (because they should have those extra skills to give them the edge, where we got buffs or heals, etc instead) an example of this was I respecced my resto druid to feral (and have no feral gear, so picked up some of that blue lvl70 pvp starter rubbish...and was shocked to see myself a few % below our main mage in a recent 5 man boss fight.<br />
<br />
As for your shammy, well tbh, pre 3.02 my enh shammy shammy had no problems questing, ret was painful. After 3.02 ret was clearly overpowered, but tbh, the enhancement shammy wasn't THAT far behind...i..e not the % behind that pallies just got nerfed...which is why I do honestly believe they've just doing a typical blizzard knee jerk reaction as per the druid nerf a couple of years ago.</div></div><hr />

Level 70 toons who have been playing the same way for over a year and are going to at the very least have to take a break from their raiding to level are going to have a hard time dealing. I expect for a while, it may seem like it isn't any fun, but if you log out until the expansion, think about how much you will miss. AND logging will not make the new changes ingame any easier to deal with when they come.<br />
<br />
I just think that a lot of the complaining is due to the fact that people can't do their same old routine in the same old way. Stop your routine. The world is on fire. Thrall and Tyrande won't make it without your help. Be a part of the action and PLAY.<br />

I agree with all of your points. I am a long-time player of Warcraft games, and I've always been interested in the lore. I believe that lore took a huge hit on many levels with WoW, so it's nice to see that Blizzard still somewhat cares about it by throwing at us what is essentially a lore-based event. I was also very pleased with the execution of the infestation (started off slowly, then became more and more prominent), and I think the fact that everyone is &quot;forced&quot; to experience it goes a long way in making the event more realistic. <br />
<br />
However, there is one (major) hiccough with it, and it's the fact that lowbies really cannot enjoy the event that much. I'm not complaining about quest givers getting killed, FPs being shut down or anything of sort. I think lowbies should be involved as much as anyone in the event. BUT a lowbie cannot hope to kill a 70 zombie, AND a lowbie zombie cannot hope to defeat anyone, player or guard, save perhaps for an obscure bread vendor. With that in mind, I think Blizzard should have normalised the ghoul abilities and stats so that a lowbie becoming one would have a zombie as powerful as a 70. People complain about how weak ghouls are anyway, so I don't think it would make much of a difference in the long run. The big problem is that as much as a lowbie might want to enjoy the event, s/he *can't*. And that's what stinks, in my opinion. <br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, I pretty much only play on one of my two 70s to enjoy the event. I wanted to get a healer priest near 60 by WotlK (I reckon healers will be in demand for the 60-70 treck with all those DKs around), but I put this on hold for now, and I accept it that way. But I'm thinking about the people who don't have 70s (or near). The event as a whole must be shit for them.</div></div><hr />

I have found that it is easier to abandon leveling my lvl 40 mage at this point, however there are places on most servers that are not as bothered by the plague as others. <br />
<br />
I think the idea of normalising the zombies would have been cool, but I think that may have moved the invasion along too far too fast. (Imagine if ALL zombies were Lvl 70! Kind of a mess) I wish there were a way to segregate lower level players, but then they really couldn't appreciate the invasion. I know that Blizzard put in low lvl quests in areas like Goldshire specifically for the invasion, but there should be more so that a lower lvl character really felt as though they were involved and not just die - rez - die - rez. I think that Blizz would like factions to band together to help out the lowbies. That's probably the idea behind turning up the heat on the invasion - get everyone to actually get angry and fight them off rather than trying to infect the faction leaders. <br />
<br />
Anyway, sociologically, I think its a great experiment, and I am bummed that I have to go to work at all this week because I would like to know what's happening. :D<br />

But I question Blizzards solution to the problem. It seems like they just nerf all the damage abilities in order to please the &quot;OP!&quot; screamers instead of adressing the real problem. Only by removing all these &quot;... extra damage when target is stunned or incapacitated&quot; elements of the paladin spells. This would solve alot of the stun, burst, dead problem. They are allready changing the Crusader Glyph. A Glyph that imo, even though I am a retri paladin myself, never should have been created. But we still have the Judgement of Command which says &quot;...allways crit if target is stunned or incapacitated.&quot;.<br />
<br />
So imo there is a few simple tricks that would remove the sick burst, hence ridding alot of whines, but still be able to keep a high and competative damage.<br />
<br />
1: Change Righteous Vengeance (this they are allready doing)<br />
2: Keep Art of War as it is, but nerf the crit bonus damage down to 5/10%.<br />
3: Remove all this &quot;...when stunned or incapacitated.&quot; bullshit.<br />
<br />
Viola! Insane burst problem solved really, specially when you consider the minor tweaks they are allready doing to the damage abilities to tune down pve damage.<br />
<br />
As for the mana regen issue, they should just do the following;<br />
<br />
1: Keep the chance to proc at 100%<br />
2: Lower the mana % restored. (0.75-0.55% should do it.)<br />
<br />
<br />
So simple really. But no, let's do it the hard way by nerfing everything, just have to increase shit again later.</div></div><hr />

I'm still trying to figure out what you're getting at. Did you expect any team with a pally to just sweep all competition? It looked like Pandemic Blue did very well in the standings and they had a pally on that team (I don't know what spec). Looks like SK EU fielded a pally a few games as well. So did team fnatic. So did x6stence. So did Team ROCCAT. <br />
<br />
That in and of itself says something when 3s have been dominated by PMR forever and paladins have been more or less forgotten in 3s. Looking at the latest SK-gaming stats, war/pal/sham is one of the dominant comps right now. Even if it isn't the top comp, they definitely weren't up there a month ago.</div></div><hr />

No one class can beat a pally solo unless they severly outgear them. As a hunter (Vorlagen-Scilla) I have an awful time trying to kill pallies who cannot be kited(BoF), can heal, do insane burst, stun/incapacitate, and become immune to ALL attacks. (I tend to not carry a pocket priest XD) I even watched an S4 warrior get facerolled by an S1 pally. There is no equality there. I really don't see what more paladins could want, seeing as how my bubble just wont cast . . I have no numbers to back my statements up obviously, but seeing as how nearly every BG I go in my buddy Dranzius-Scilla owns everyone. He got a 50 KB 0 death streak in Brutal/Venge with a Cat's edge. Don't get me wrong I fell my hunter does loads of dps. I never go oom, but I feel a nerf coming my way as well. All I can say is, let's wait until we see how things are at 80 and bear with Blizzard until then. Senseless whining over the internet solves how many issues you may be having?

<br />
No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying it says a hell of a lot about how much pallys jumped in power over the course of a week when the top world teams went from their usual comps to including an untested, unknown comp just because of how powerful that new addition was.<br />
<br />
Look, I get you guys are upset. My main used to be a hunter. The least represented class in arenas in every bracket in every season. At least paladins had a few glimpses of being good. I remember s1 holy was the cat's meow in 2s. I also remember not very long ago 5s teams picking up ret pallys as well.<br />
<br />
However, that doesn't give you the right to break the game for the other 9 classes. You had your fun. GC already said if they nerfed you too much, they'll adjust it again. So unbunch your panties and chill out.<br />

I still say some nerfs were reasonable while others are completely outa wack, your gonna end up putting ret back to the bottom of the barrel, and all these other classes whining about ret wont' stop until thats right where we are...<br />
So whatever give us a taste at being capable of topping dps on some fights then kick us back down to the bottom 5 no matter of our gear or skill.... thanks blizz u suck..

<br />
Retri as a spec did need buffing, dmg was not great, and it sucked for you guys that like hitting things with fat maces.<br />

but at the end of the day, the paladin class a hybrid class, and under no curcumstance should a hybrid ever be out performing the pures in a given role. other wise there'd be no point rolling them. I've been in raids since the patch and retridins are top on dmg, above better gear'd mages. thats just not right. yes buff them, it makes for more fun, and its helped me lvl my retridin the last few weeks, but it badly needs balancing. <br />

Because mages/hunters/rogues/locks bring anything nearly remotely close to a raid like blessings or judgements or DI. You want to talk about straight up damage and ignore everything else, you're going to have to face the fact that you rolled the wrong class. I don't know if you've heard, but Blizzard is intending to give everyone the ability to dual spec. That means at the drop of a hat, you can go from damage to healing to tanking. Mages can go from damage to damage..to..well, damage. That's it. You want to do as much damage as the pure classes? What do they get in return? If the answer is nothing, you might as well just bench those four classes. Because there is no way in hell Misdirect, Soulstones, or mage tables is on par with the ability to change your raid role. Don't even try to bring up the gear argument. At the end of a tier's lifespan, 90% of the loot either goes to offspec or gets sharded anyhow. <br />
<br />
The pure classes should do more damage than hybrids given equal gear and skill. The only thing is, they shouldn't be head and shoulders above the hybrids. GC mentioned that they were aiming between 5%-10% difference between the hybrids and the pures and I'm fine with that. Rets should 100% be able to compete with the other hybrids given equal skill and gear, but to say you should be in the same league as the pure classes is the same as saying I should have your job. I can do it just as good as you, but I can do more. Now go sit outside while we down these bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
pve wise, we've dominated too. Ive been playing rogue pve og pala pve/pvp and from the latest patch 3.0.2 i have been testing the chages of the patch and it is fail. ive been raiding MH, BT, SWP since the release with my pala and both overall and 90% of all boss fights ive been top 2(mostly nr1) on the dps meter with a +2300 dps, and compared to gear( My pala gear is mostly craft and some S2 with BS - Lionheart Exe) and the other classes and the raid is with 5-6/8 T6 gear, and still im owning them, that havent been the idea or the meaning that Hybrid classes should ever be top 3-5 overall dps wise, those spots belongs to, Rogue,Mage,Warlock,Hunter, the 4 pure dps classes.<br />
