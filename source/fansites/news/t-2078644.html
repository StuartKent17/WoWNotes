Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 26<br />
Additional class tuning changes were added to the hotfix notes:<br />
Classes<br />
Developer’s Notes: After carefully considering the constructive feedback we’ve received over the weekend, we’ve made some revisions to this week’s tuning. The class changes listed in this hotfix update, as well as those from the previous update will be applied during weekly maintenance in each region. Note that several changes from the previous update have been altered or removed, which is indicated by a strikethrough in the notes below.<br />
<br />

<br />
Havoc<br />
<br />
Bloodlet (Talent) now deals 150% of initial Throw Glaive damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#hAAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#g))<br />
<br />
Arcane<br />
<br />
Quickening (Talent)’s maximum stacks are now 50, and it will not refresh its duration once at 50 stacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#VAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#U))<br />
<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
Mind Sear damage increased by 80% and Insanity generation increased by 50%.<br />
Mind Flay damage increased by 20%.<br />
Mind Spike damage increased by 28%.<br />
Void Ray maximum stacks reduced to 4.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Given the damage increase to Mind Sear, Mind Flay, and Mind Spike, this still results in an overall increase to the value of the talent.<br />
<br />
Voidform stacks no longer increase while Dispersion is active.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: We would prefer that Surrender to Madness not be as dominant as it is, and that it can’t be extended for quite so long. However, addressing this further would require significant changes to the spec beyond what we want to do in a tuning pass at this time. We will look for an opportunity to take a more comprehensive look at this issue in a future patch.<br />

<br />
Arms<br />
<br />
Tactician proc rate increased by 15%.<br />
Hamstring no longer procs Tactician.<br />
Exploit the Weakness (Artifact Trait) bonus reduced to 4% per point.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
NPCs<br />
<br />
Suramar NPCs should no longer remove a player’s stealth at the start of their Arcane Investigation casting.<br />
Interacting with Nomi should now take priority when his area is crowded.<br />
<br />
<br />

Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - September 23<br />
Several of the previously listed hotfixes were altered or removed. The rest of the original hotfixes still will be applied. <br />

<br />
Shadow<br />
<br />
Mind Sear damage and Insanity generation increased by 50%.<br />
Voidform stacks no longer increase while Dispersion and Void Torrent are active. <br />
<br />
Note: These abilities prevent Insanity drain from increasing while active, which effectively reduces the Insanity drain for the entire remainder the current Voidform. This was proving to be too powerful, so we’re now making sure that the damage bonus and Insanity drain from Voidform remain in sync.<br />
<br />
The benefit of Mass Hysteria (Artifact Trait) is now capped at 100%. <br />
<br />
Note: We want it to be rewarding when you’re able to maintain Surrender to Madness for an extremely long time, but the amount of damage this trait was contributing in those circumstances was excessive.<br />

Skinning and Mob Tapping<br />
We agree that the way this works at present isn't ideal and can be quite frustrating. It's something we want to fix, but it's quite a complicated issue to tackle so we don't have a good estimate on when any fix might happen. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/769968-let-us-skin-our-mob/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613552300?page=2#31))<br />

Legion Reception<br />
I appreciate the post, but I don't think there's a point for this discussion to continue.<br />
<br />
If you pay attention to the majority of our community, on these forums, on social media, on our fansites, and in-game, reaction to Legion is overwhelmingly positive and a large majority of the player-base is having a pretty great time. In fact, I haven't seen so many people happy with such large aspects of the game since mid-Wrath.<br />
<br />
We appreciate people's feedback, but there's a point where we disagree - and this is it.<br />
<br />
Closing.<br />
<br />
Edit: I'm the first to admit the our game isn't perfect, and that therein, Legion isn't either, but that does not herald the death of WoW/Legion, and talking in circles about that doesn't help the community.

What the hell are you talking about. For havoc there is only one patch and it's wednesday.<br />
This patch will include all the expected nerfs but:<br />
- 200% to 100% Bloodlet goes to 150 instead (okay but could be better changes with design swift, still unbalanced with the rest)<br />
- No 30% nerf on TG (thank god)<br />
<br />
We're no king AoE anymore and if we were anyway, we were only on bursts. Our ST is gimped but will remain at the WW rank ~.</div></div><hr />

WW and feral - no clue. They are usually nerfed pretty fast.<br />

Mages are just op as always. Atleast they nerfed arcane bevause they could be godlike on long fights. Just look at simcraft what wouldve been possible. 400k simcraft dps...<br />

I think he's referring to the Demon Hunter adjustments. As for the previous post that stated that it's nice of BLizz to still listen to its subs, it shouldn't only happen for the new shiny classes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Statix</div><div class="date">2016-09-27, 08:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For those asking for WW nerfs, the Strike of the Windlord nerf was very effective. My AOE burst is a lot less powerful. I still do amazing single target burst, but after that, our substained still drops off quickly because our highest damaging abilities have high cooldowns.<br />
<br />
Arcane and Fire Mages, BM and MM Hunters, Havoc Demon Hunters, even Combat Rogues often do more burst than me and more frequently. And that's with people equal to or less than my itemlevel.<br />
<br />
On top of that, Monk requires a lot more abilities to be used to achieve effective AOE. Arcane Mages spam Arcane Explosion and Arcane Barrage and achieve the same, while I need to use 7 abilities and, make sure not every ability is a repeat of the other to ensure my mastery and the Hit Combo talent kick in, and make sure I attack as many different targets as possible to buff Spinning Crane Kick. With it being so complicated, the result should be rewarding.<br />
<br />
Strike of the Windlord was too OP, and too easy; the nerf was justified. Our AOE burst is gone, but everything else we currently have, with the effort that goes into our AOE rotation, I'd say WW Monks deserve to be the best at substained AOE.</div></div><hr />

We agree that the way this works at present isn't ideal and can be quite frustrating. It's something we want to fix, but it's quite a complicated issue to tackle so we don't have a good estimate on when any fix might happen<br />
<br />
So they were really quick on nerfing the amount of mats we got from each mob.<br />

This patch will include all the expected nerfs but:<br />
- 200% to 100% Bloodlet goes to 150 instead (okay but could be better changes with design swift, still unbalanced with the rest)<br />
- No 30% nerf on TG (thank god)<br />
<br />
We're no king AoE anymore and if we were anyway, we were only on bursts. Our ST is gimped but will remain at the WW rank ~.<br />
<br />
The other patch notes are still in effect, havoc is getting nerfed. End of, it needs it. Call it balancing if you will.<br />
<br />
The only changes that are being discarded across BOTH sets of patch notes are the ones that are striked out. It even tells you this in the paragraph before the patch notes.<br />

If you still think after this nerf incoming DH is that OP, ask yourself some question about your or your mates gameplay. From the start of Legion, and it's a fact I saw many players that QQed about my DPS as a DH but then I saw they are playing very bad. I even saw a Warrior without using rage to improve mortal strike. Only DK, Fury (but they scale hard so it has to be counted too, while DH doesn't scale well - our mastery is bad), some lock spec (but beware scaling too) need love now. All other HAVE the ability to surpass DH in ST (and now AoE wichi is super cool) and if they don't, they can improve a lot.</div></div><hr />

You missed my &quot;all nerf expected are incoming but&quot; phrase didn't you ? :p<br />
The 'but' means everything that were in BOTH patches notes (effect wednesday, NO live yet as many believed because of the inappropriate word 'hotfix') except what was under.<br />
<br />
Mainly as a whole:<br />
- Nerf AoE (diserved)<br />
- Nerf Burst AoE (diserved)<br />
- Nerf ST a bit but not that much so we would have been in grave with the original 100% bloodlet + 30% throw glaive nerf<br />
<br />
Still there will be many DH who don't know how to benefit from the best spec cause it's a known skill gap. Some DH are doing 150K, other can output 250k. And I repeat the problem remains in not able to nerf AoE Throw Glaive without nerfing HUGE our ST. Design problem but as it will be wednesday is OK while they think about our left out talents that serve for nothing right now.<br />
<br />
I also have tears for DK mainly ...<br />

Cleave fights // AoE counted in yeah, that's why we need a nerf but nerfing AoE without nerfing PURE ST is a challenge blizz will have to face off and for now this is quite good waiting for some design changes. (repeat and repeat again for people that don't try to understand the gamedesign of DH).</div></div><hr />

Maybe if you actually bothered to read the posts, you would see it was genuine concern and not just &quot;fotm QQers&quot;<br />
<br />
Hard number crunching went into the supposed &quot;changes&quot; and Demon Hunters ONLY dps spec was completely shat on. The key words here are &quot;Only&quot; and &quot;dps&quot;<br />
<br />
Every. Single. Demon Hunter. Knows that our AoE was completely broken and deserved the nerf, our ST however did not need the major nerfs Blizzard originally planned with.</div></div><hr />

Probably because DHs aren't godmode; I lead a Mythic raiding guild and our 2 DHs are only high on AoE encounters – their single target is decidedly middle-of-the-pack, and even their AoE is comparable with other strong AoE specs. If you're struggling to beat them, you're either looking at AE damage as a class that doesn't excel at that aspect of the game, or you're being outgeared/outplayed. In a situation where everyone has a similar ilvl and skill level, they're not ridiculously strong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did your disc priests have some healing assignment? How many people were there in the raid? Disc works fine as long as you don't mind that you don't keep atonement on more than 3-4 people, peaking to 6-10 at aoe damage bursts. Personally I felt it was super weird to ignore 2/3 of the raid and let PWR pick up my targets... Compared to a 5man where I can heal everyone just fine while delivering considerable damage, my raid participation felt utterly pathetic.<br />
So basically the problems are 1) atonement application does not scale with bigger groups 2) if PWR picks up a shitty target, you can't change that and either waste your healing on this target or waste further gcds and mana to extend the atonement to better targets.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rolex Snob</div><div class="date">2016-09-27, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No real assignments other than coordinating dispels in final fight. We had 11-12 ppl all night and never had an issue with heals. I felt we could have 2 healed a lot of fights and my ilvl is only 840.<br />
<br />
I also spent most of my AP on my holy initially because of the doom and gloom but I decided to push through as disc for raids since it's the first week and figured what the hell and also holy is typical boring healer style.<br />
<br />
I love disc this expansion, it's made the game fun again.<br />
<br />
The biggest adjustment to disc is that you have to operate off your global cooldown (never ever not be pressing a keybind). Atonement should be top heal, PWS and then plea. PWR is usually 4th with shadowmend being close to last.</div></div><hr />

Sry, but only use &quot;middle of the pack&quot; when the class/spec is really middle of the pack. That is (was) Unholy DK and a few others at the same dps level. Havoc DH were far better than middle of the pack. If you're doing 10k-15k+ ahead (or less) of the middle guys, you're not middle anymore.</div></div><hr />

You must be doing something wrong then. We're a little mana starved and have to really watch. I'm pulling same numbers if not better than the other healers and anywhere between 80k and 100k DPS. Sustaining 230k hps with bursts of 300k in both 10 man heroic and 18 man.</div></div><hr />

They are at WW rank average and it's the middle of the pack. DK, Fury etc. are NOT middle of the pack. They are BOTTOM hard and need tweak hard and they will get. We, DHs don't want to be that level which we avoided by yelling as a group.</div></div><hr />
