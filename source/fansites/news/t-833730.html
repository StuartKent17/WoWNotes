I couldn't pick all the good guides I got during the contest and I figured I could do one last update with all the guides from people who didn't win but still did a good job. If you have some free time, I strongly suggest the Guides Submission - Rare (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/323-Guides-Submission-Rare) and Guides Submission - Uncommon (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/322-Guides-Submission-Uncommon) forums to check out all the submissions.<br />
<br />
It was ridiculously hard to pick winners for the contest and I hated every second of it. Refusing good guides just because there was something slightly better or because it didn't match the few criteria I had is like resurrecting a gnome in a raid, it really really sucks but you know you have to do it anyway. I'll probably switch to a voting system for the next contest and hope that people won't try to cheat it too much. <br />
<br />
Also, I will (finally) send the prizes to the winner today, the reason why I delayed them for so long is mostly to make sure that none of the guide was stolen from another player/website. I figured that waiting 10 days to make sure that nobody come and claims one of the guide was the best thing to do, it didn't happen, enjoy your prizes! (It's also too late to do it now, don't waste your time trying to steal a prize with that)<br />

Guild Reputation Cap<br />
Well, I think this is a valid complaint being that there's an initial buy-in period where you're kind of wondering why you have to level up reputation with a guild you've been in for a year, but that's sort of the nature of implementing new features like this.<br />
<br />
You are correct in that we do not want people to join guilds, be able to immediately buy rewards that the guild unlocked, and jet. Your idea of unlocking rewards based on time spent in the guild instead of contribution isn't quite right either.<br />
<br />
Guild rep exists to gate rewards based on someone's actual contributions to their guild, not just being some dope on the roster. Jumping in to guild dungeon and raid runs (with 80% members, [40% for 40 person raids] until 4.0.6 which drops 5 person dungeons to variable gains based on 3/5, 4/5, and 5/5), winning rated bg's, or earning guild achievements, all help earn guild rep. And yes, so do quests, should you find yourself doing them.<br />
<br />
The point is not to force you to do things you do not want to do, but instead be rewarded for participating in activities with your guild. And it uses criteria that ideally keep it from getting too 'gamey'. We could probably say if you make a flask, give it to a guild mate, and they drink it, you get some guild rep. And then that type of action turns into a fun farming game that has nothing to do with actually encouraging guild interaction. The criteria we've set are hopefully those that are both beneficial to the guild and its members, as well as avoiding making grindy actions the best way to get rep.<br />
<br />
As far as making it account wide, I'm not a designer, but that definitely hinders, again, the guild participation factor. Once you have guild rep set on one character, and if that then applied account wide, your desire to contribute to guild content that isn't pushing gearing your character drops substantially. However, if you have an alt that's 80, yeah you probably will want to join in on that Blackrock Caverns run being put together. Otherwise you're a jaded 85 guildie who has variable interest in actually helping someone else out (Yes, yes, I'm sure you're the most selfless and helpful person in your guild, but that scenario is too often the rule and not the exception). It could also be gamed to some degree... but I'm not sure to much effect.<br />
<br />
As I said initially this can be a weird start conceptually, but while contributing with guild members you're gaining rep, and you'll get access to those rewards from then on. As this is still a fairly new and fairly big and complex system we're watching it very closely, and fully intend to keep adding to it and improving upon it. Your constructive feedback is welcome.<br />
<br />
How do random dailies or fishing quests have anything to do with guild interaction?<br />
Maybe not a whole lot directly (although there are a ton of indirect benefits), but it is a way for the super low pop guilds or very inactive guilds, and their members, to rep up. Say your guild has 10 people and of those 10 people a couple log in maybe once a week, we want there to be some way that you'll eventually level your guild, and in addition, be able to rep up and purchase rewards. It's going to be slower, for sure, but it's there. <br />
<br />
As for your previous comment regarding flasks etc. I think I can see who contributes to the guild on a larger scale as well via the use of the Guild Bank. Isn't helping the guild aquire the mats and items that help us all do things a valid part of contributing to a guild?<br />
Sure, but again, that can be gamed. Making guild rep a meta game of depositing mats, to remove them, launder them, and re-deposit to exalted is not the point of the system. And while it would be cool to recognize those things, there's simply too many loopholes.<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud)'s setup of the month is one week early this month because of the release of the new CPUs, it's a pretty good time to upgrade and I guess a lot of people will be interested in the article. (The next one might be in 2 months instead of one now that the big wave of upgrades is done) <br />
<br />
Read if you plan to upgrade - New CPUs and GPUs are not coming anytime soon, so now is a good time to buy. New SSDs are coming later in Q1 that might be of interest if you are not ready to buy just yet.<br />
<br />
Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer) for any extra questions! <br />

Granted addons have been doing this for years but that was not quite the same for a new user, who learns addons over time but starts out learning to play the game right. now you push buttons cause they glow when you're supposed to push them, and go where game tells you to, all mindless, you're even practically immune to death until level 10 do to OP starting moves now and practically unlimited mana and health regen even in combat. I remember when pulling 2 mobs meant i was gonna die. Now i could probably create a mage, pull 3 mobs, and melee them down and live through it, completely ignoring proper play. This doesn't teach the new user anything except drops em on their ass later when they are expected to just know how to play when they step out into real game world :). instead of learning when to use charge, or when you pull a mob with gun/bow and how to LoS, or sheep pull at early levels while soloing. I feel like what i had to learn by level 12, people still don't know by level max level anymore. and it's a darn shame.</div></div><hr />

People were always this dumb when first playing, without friends playing, and most of them being 12. Any grown up who starts playing this, probably have a friend or two also playing it, and will easily pick up on stuff, yes they might still suck a bit, but they know more now than they did before because they get so much help. Don't tell me you liked to run around for 10 years in say, Westfall, because that mob didn't drop that Q item you needed, only to find out that you had to talk to a guy, then run 3 yards, do a /dance, phone for some take-out and then log off and on 10 times, then the mob would drop the Q item! (I know this isn't true, exaggerating to get my point through). Nobody either learned when to use their abilities before from dying. Just because you pulled 2 mobs at the same time, didn't mean your learned to CC one while killing the other, you probably either asked for help, or went somewhere else. People will always look for easier option rather than testing out and learning how to adapt to new and tougher situations. Don't go acting like this game is making it too easy on new people, no, it is helping to people so they improve faster, and anyways, about the Qhelper being implemented, before there was Questhelper addon or anything, there was still Thottbot and Wowhead, you kid yourself if you think you can convince me you didn't use any of those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not true, (unless he meant mean no top end GPUs to beat HD 6970 or GTX 580) because nVidia will be releasing the GTX 560 very soon, some are predicting next week. This card is expected to compete with the AMD Radeon HD 6950, it will outperform the GTX 470 and it should run cooler and more efficiently than the 460/470/480 series Fermi GPUs. Price range is expected to be somewhere between $200-$300. It's definitely worth waiting to see the price and performance of this card before buying a new GPU. The 460 and 470 will likely drop in price when the 560 comes out, so that's another reason to wait.<br />
<br />
Also if you're buying a new system right now, there's really no reason to get 2x2GB RAM because the cost of 2x4GB isn't much more and it won't be long before 4GB is a bit of a bottleneck, if it isn't already.</div></div><hr />

So your choice of Monitor is very high quality but it's not 3D and mouse / keyboard are not high end. Wouldn't Filco or higher quality keyboard as well as mouse be better choice for Unicorn. Understandable that everything is personal perference I just don't think when you took a HUGE quality jump from $330 to $560 in the monitor, yet you only got a touch better keyboard and mouse? <br />
<br />
Anyways thanks for the post and links for review on few of the product choices I just think you could of choosen a much higher quality mouse / keyboard in the Unicorn section. Just incase anyone ask some suggestions I would high recommend Logitech G19, Logitech G510, Steelseries 7G/6GV2, Filco Keyboards. For monitor I would given option for 3D gaming choice of Alienware OptX AW2310 23-inch 3D Full HD Widescreen Monitor roughly $450. Mouse could of gone with New Epic version of Razer Naga, Razer Mamba, Logitech G700, Steelseries Xai, Steelseries WoW Cata MMo gaming mouse. Anyways there is a good chunk of choices that are higher end components to each his own choice at the end of the day though.<br />

I don't know, I usually still get that. I'm very much a &quot;fantasy&quot; person though. I actually dislike the modern seventh-gen graphics because they approach the uncanny-valley for me, it kills immersion. WoW is much better because it's graphics aren't detailed enough to tell the whole story, the brain has to fill in. So for me, WoW &gt; Mass Effect III, graphically. I know, sounds weird. It's just about immersion, there's a point where I think it's more like a movie, less like a medium wanting me to use my brain, like a book or game.<br />
<br />
Also, I never ever ever spoiler stuff before I saw it, it completely knocks down immersion. When we reach a new boss I usually got videos and all open in the background, but first comes wipe, then reading up. No killing immersion. :)</div></div><hr />

32 bit programs (which includes effectively every game still) cannot use more than 2GB. That means that no matter how demanding the game is, 2 GB is always left for the OS and background programs.

You essentially become trapped in that guild, because who wants to grind themselves up from neutral in another guild?!<br />
<br />
It'd be nice if there were some sort of compromise like when you leave your guild and join a new guild then 50% of your old guild rep is applied to the new guild or something along those lines. Of course, some idiots would abuse any system like that and would ruin it for the rest of us. This is why we can't have nice things.<br />
<br />
My point is that I understand the point in having a barrier to prevent people from jumping between guilds with no consequences, but right now there is very little incentive to leave a guild, even if it is full of drama and makes you miserable.</div></div><hr />

But do not give up readers, this is not a fate you need to condemn yourselves too. Those with the self awareness can bring back a lot of that early unique fun. Simply approach the game in a different way, set yourself informal guidelines. Experience the zones and the quests in the way they are most fun, atleast for the first play through. Only Wowhead and Wiki that which will not be detrimental to your experience.<br />

We had a bit of a discussion on this in some computer thread earlier. Given the price of RAM (it's pretty darned cheap right now) and how most users don't just game on their fancy new PCs, it never hurts to have excess RAM available. Also, if you play StarCraft II, last time I played the campaign, I had the game reaching nearly 3GB of RAM used ;). Right now, I've got 2GB of RAM used and WoW isn't even open! :p</div></div><hr />

If any new raid is finished in 3 hours 1 month after release something is wrong. Just look at naxx, If your going to raid this early in an expansion set aside about 5-6 hours for a full run possibly more. Not every one want's to read strats before the first time, I sure as hell don't. Also you don't have to worry about a lot of the players who enjoy figuring out their own strats, they are not in your pugs. ;)</div></div><hr />

This is so true. When graphics get better, your brain stops working and dreaming. This is the reason, why SNES-RPGs like &quot;Secret of Mana&quot; or &quot;Terranigma&quot; etc. still rule! The games look very old, but for my generation, it's like reading a book. You only get a few information about the &quot;look&quot; and the &quot;feeling&quot; and the rest is up to your imagination. In WoW a &quot;city&quot; consists of two huts, a letterbox and - if you're lucky - an inn-keeper. The only &quot;real&quot; cities are the main cities of each race. But that's okay, because in your imagination, Goldshire expands to a real little village.</div></div><hr />

While Bobcat is going to be in production in Q4 of this year, with system availability in Q1 of 2011 - Bulldozer is still a 2011 project and AMD isn’t giving any guidance as to when in 2011.<br />
<br />
Parts are already back and in AMD’s labs but we have no indication of performance or rollout schedule.

<br />
Seriously can't wait for ToR and GW2. This Guild Rep is just another example of WoW covering up their lack of content with grind. <br />
<br />
1. They reward people with guild rep who just log in and do dailies at TB, NOT people who actually contribute to the guild. <br />
2. They punish people who want to play more than one character instead of grinding on one. <br />
3. The guild rep system is designed so that the players in a guild usually have more rep than the guild leader<br />
4. Rewards that can be obtained by people willing to grind, when your most dedicated members that have been around for years but don't grind as much are stuck with nothing.<br />
<br />
Does anyone still think this guild rep grind was a good idea? Please, if you do report to the nearest teaching hospital for some medical attention, and/or testing. Our guild leader bothers to run lower level members through instances, picks herbs for our alchemist etc. Because of that, we have lower ranked members that have way more rep than the people who are actually dedicated to our guild. We have members that have just given up on WoW because they feel like they will never be able to grind enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chiming in here as a power user, who monitors his power usage closely.<br />
<br />
I was running an overclocked C2Duo e4300 at 3.2ghz (first gen C2D, power hungry), 2x2gb memory, 8800gt, and water cooling with several drives, on a 430w PSU. I was pulling maybe 250w at the wall, measured with the Kill-a-watt device.<br />
<br />
The key is to use a quality power supply. A good Seasonic PSU (like my current X-650) will run at about 88-90% efficiency. Compare this to your $15 &quot;500watt&quot; power supply, which may not be able to put out 500w with stable volts, running at 60-70% efficiency.<br />
<br />
Up until recently, I was running a C2Quad 9550, oc'ed to 3.5ghz, 2x2gb memory, a Radeon 5850, and a tons of HDD's on that very same 430w seasonic PSU. I don't know what I was pulling at the wall, but it ran BEAUTIFULLY.</div></div><hr />

maximum spec maximum CPU power peak imaginable - around 520-540.<br />
<br />
how can you take recommendations like this seriously? and i bet he is getting payed :(<br />
<br />
ps<br />
oh, did the funny. minimal spec, overclocked to 3.4 ghz, and with freaking crossfire of 5770<br />
drumrolls - 420-430 maximum consumption peak. <br />
overclocked and in crossfire, still less then 500 watt he recommended.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry but the Power Supply can only put out 430w with a 86% eff... sorry dude you ps example doesn't work.<br />

Up until recently, I was running a C2Quad 9550, oc'ed to 3.5ghz, 2x2gb memory, a Radeon 5850, and a tons of HDD's on that very same 430w seasonic PSU. I don't know what I was pulling at the wall, but it ran BEAUTIFULLY.<br />
<br />
<br />
I Call BS the minimum watts need to run that setup is 394watts with the following<br />
<br />
9550 with overclocking , 2sticks of ram, Radeon 5850, 4 Drives (? A ton) assuming 3 fans( 1 ex and 2 intake), and 1 DVD Drive<br />
<br />
You PSU can only put out a max 378.4 Watts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh, i didnt mention it - the calculations i've done were already made with 80 percent efficiency PSU standard. that means actual power draw numbers are 20 percent less. also, modern PSU, especially those in the review we are talking about, are de facto around 90 percent efficiency, also, this is a maximum possible peak load, and a good, branded PSU can hold load bigger then they have printed on the box for a short period of time.<br />
<br />
it means that a 450 corsair PSU (which one i have, for it is virtually silent) can hold a crossfire/OCed setup for which author advised a 500 watt PSU.<br />
i can understand the logic of buying a more powerful PSU for a silence freak like me - with a proper fan control it can run silent on a comparatively low load. but this is not about it, i guess, most of the MMOchamp readers dont care much about the noise. at least video cards suggested are not those of the quiet ones.<br />
<br />
so i still think my example is valid. but it doesnt matter, really. those who bother about their setup will not build it around these advices - lucky we have very good boards on teh internets with some proper guides.<br />

call it whatever you want, obviously you have numbers at your side. a proper load calculator tells me right now that recommended PSU wattage for that setup would be <br />
drumrolls<br />
385.<br />
so no surprise a person with this setup and a proper seasonic 450 watt PSU will have zero problems running it. <br />
<br />
most fantasies about PSU overwattage comes from novice users experience with nonbranded, bad PSU. they have much bigger wattage printed on the box that they can actually holds - in fact, even some decent brands, like thermaltake in particular, had done that - i personally seen a TT 400 watt budget PCU that was in fact a 250 watt PSU inside. it could withstand higher loads, but in 3-4 months it just died, no surprise.<br />
things like that have given birth to the terrible tradition to use very high wattage PSUs on almost every rig possible. it stupid, but its like what it is.</div></div><hr />

The 120hz from 3D monitors is definitely worth it for people building rigs for gaming purposes + with the decent ones you're getting a better overall monitor than the Dell E2311<br />
<br />
Heya ! The link on the 3rd spec is not E2311h but u2311h which is a IPS panel monitor (e2311h is TN). Ips has more accurate colours and better viewing angles than TN but worse ms response and usually frequency ( cons are not important IMO). 3D should be very annoying for hc gamers IMO ( I can't even stand movies on 3D:). That said u2311h is a good option and pretty cheap for a IPS monitor.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who doesn't know how to pick components themselves won't be doing serious, 5ghz overclocks. So the non-pro board will not only do everything they want, but cost $30 less.<br />
<br />
Also, you should point out the aftermarket HSF is OPTIONAL. Only buy it if you are overclocking. the I5 2500k can run up to a maximum of 80C before fail. With the stock cooler on a chip that isn't overclocked it runs in the high 30's under load and in the high 20's while idle. Which, in Intel chip standards is freezing. So if someone does not plan to SLI and overclock to 4.5ghz they could save $90 by switching to the non-pro bored and going with the stock HSF. They could then put that $90 into a higher end GPU and have a machine that would outperform the one listed with all the same features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because cost is still a consideration. The revodrive x2 is also not a standard drive, PCI express drives have been around for a couple of years, not sure why they are suddenly more &quot;interesting&quot; now. They just happen to cost, oh I don't know, 4 times the price and the reliability of their data storage has been called into question.<br />
<br />
Everyone knows the Crucial C300 series is the fastest on the market. Only caveat is that you're required to make sure you can support it (SATA3) and it costs nearly double other SSD drives but you're not getting double the performance. That price:performance ratio is at the level of absurdity. It's beyond the point of reason. Are you really going to notice the 0.6 seconds?</div></div><hr />

It just overcomplicates things. Really guilds should be something people either do or don't do at their own discretion, and putting a bunch of little rewards in is stupid. I mean, aren't there already enough rewards for being in a guild vs. solo play? Access to timely and reliable groups? Access to the professions of the guild? Maybe guild repairs? Epic loot? Etc? Being in a guild is its own fucking reward without having extra rewards piled onto that.<br />
<br />
Right now, if you're not in a guild, or not in a high level guild, I bet you feel left out big time. I know I would.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Using the &quot;Curious piece of landscape, I will explore it later&quot; one as an example. I used to be that guy too... and now I'm not. Not just because WoWhead or any other wiki site says there is nothing there, but because there really is nothing there. Even back in the old Asheron's Call days if people remember that game, there were &quot;Point of Interests&quot; on the map you would go to and there would be Stonehenge type ruins or an abandoned castle. Problem was, they were interesting to look at, or as decorations, but you couldn't interact with them at all. They had virtually no purpose other than eye candy. WoW suffers heavily from the same thing. <br />
<br />
Newmans Landing being a prime example of this problem. You can't interact with the little house there. You can't find any lore or anything related to it in game, who built it, why are goblins there. You can't read any of the books on the shelves. You can't do nothing there. You can't make a note about it on your map. You can't ask any NPC about it. When the artist created that house, he wasn't creating it with a backstory and lore. He wasn't thinking about who built it or why. He modeled it in Maya or whatever 3d program he uses, plopped it down in the world 3d space somewhere, added some non-interactive doodads to it. And submitted it for approval to his boss. His boss said &quot;looks good&quot; and it got put into the game. The most exciting thing about it now is it can be mentioned in the dozens of threads that have popped up over the years &quot;Weird places in WoW&quot;, &quot;Secret places in WoW&quot;. <br />
<br />
It all comes back to human psychology. If you consider people who live in cities with landmarks... the landmarks are not exciting to them. If you live in Toronto, and see the CN Tower everyday on your way to work, you don't go &quot;Ooooh ahhh look at that&quot; everytime you see it. You don't even look at it most of the time. Tourists however, will take their picture with it in the background, show it to their family and friends when they get home... say &quot;look I was there&quot;. You show that same picture to someone in Toronto however, and they shrug because if they turn their head, the tower is right there. The WoW world is like you live in a city with a landmark, but so does everyone else. So there is nobody to show the picture to who will care because they all see the same landmarks everyday on their way to work.<br />
<br />
Same principle applies to the &quot;Abyssals killing fisherman for sport&quot; quest. You stop caring about the story behind the quest because you really have no effect on it. With phasing now, you have some effect on some things to a limited extent... but after not having that for so long... and making it limited to only some facets of the world, it doesn't resonate enough to make a difference. If you kill those 15 Abyssal creatures and finish the quest, then go back to the beach, chances are they are still there killing fisherman. So what was the point of even bothering? Oh right, the gold or experience you got for turning in the quest. Which goes back to why it doesn't matter what the story is behind it. It could've been a white untextured box banging up against a blue box and psychologically it would be exactly the same. The only reward was the gold or exp or item, there was no reward in the form of closure to the original problem which was the fisherman being killed for sport. So psychologically, when you later get asked to help a village that is being attacked by rabid grizzly bears, in your mind you know that even if you killed every grizzly in the forest, they will keep coming, so your mind dismisses the information about the bears and the village altogether and focuses only on the information that is relevant to you... the reward. <br />
<br />
Anyway, this is already too long... and there really isn't any way to &quot;fix&quot; the problem. These are businesses that make these games to make a profit... and none of them have unlimited manpower, time and resources to create a fully interactive, fully immersive, fully living virtual world without the issues that result in the mindset illustrated in that comic. There's nothing we can do about it, so just like the quests in the game, our human minds dismiss that information and focus on what's relevant to us.... EPIC LOOTS!!!<br />
