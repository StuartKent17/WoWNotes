Np. But the fact he didn't retreat and decided that even with the Army of the Light being damaged, this would be the final stand showed that Illidan's little pep talk worked. Basically the whole &quot;Stop being a pussy&quot; to which the person responds with &quot;I'm not a pussy&quot; and sticks their finger in the electric socket to prove it.</div></div><hr />

Likely teens to 30 year olds thinking everything should be hardcore catered to them with no ounce of fun cause &quot;Fun is for casuals&quot; bs. Instead of just accepting that sometimes they will make things for families and children to enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, they didnt even showcase the new map for Overwatch, and they showed content for WoW that pretty much anyone that cares already knew about, heroes stuff they revealed monday.... Hearthstone was nothing but cringeworthy and pointless.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, the animations were gorgeous and well made, but I dont look to Blizzard reveal ceremonies for videos.....<br />
<br />
This was a waste of a presentation and they just generated tons of negative hype for their company, they should've just not done one at all if this is all they had to bring.<br />
<br />
Sure Blizzcon will be great, but... yeah, this left a bad taste in my mouth, didnt feel like it was blizzard at all.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who thought there was gonna be Diablo 3 or anything Diablo at this event was just fooling themselves. <br />
<br />
<br />
Just hired a bunch of people for an unannounced Diablo project that is probably just getting going full steam on development and the Necro pack just came out for Diablo 3 so what do you really expect till Blizzcon or most likely next year at the earliest?</div></div><hr />

That is probably what they hate the most, in that they can't stand a company creating games and what not, for a younger audience because it makes them feel so insecure or something like that.. :)<br />

Recore Definitive Edition announcement was the big one by Microsoft lol. EA announced nothing new. Blizzard says they have a major announcement to make and it's just patch 7.3, which is crazy that a 7.x patch would be teased as a major announcement.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it's a fun conference for those that attended, and I knew it's no E3, but still expected more than this. The only thing even modestly newsworthy was XB1X preorders opening, and that could have been done anytime outside of a conference.</div></div><hr />

There was more information to be had at their preview this monday, the overwatch short could just've gone up on youtube.<br />
<br />
It was a wasted presentation that they called &quot;Blizzards biggest gamescon yet&quot; .... I mean dont hold a presentation when all you have is minor stuff, show it off of course, but dont hype it up like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- More WoW related stuff, perhaps some new Artifact skins (they did say they're done creating them, but does this also mean they've put every one of them ingame?).<br />
They could have unveiled another intermediate raid like Trial of Valor or another patch after Argus.<br />
<br />
Can't precisely say WHAT I expected but todays reveal felt a bit lackluster. <br />
This was all know weeks before Gamescom, Bellular pumped out videos to cover every single bit of the known 7.3 stutt better than a fire truck.<br />
The trailer was kinda neat, have to give 'em that.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I wished for an expansion teaser. <br />
<br />
- More Overwatch stuff, like others said at least SHOW the god damn map when you're presenting it.<br />
<br />
- More HotS stuff, perhaps by showing different skins for KT or other heroes instead of teasing some of them. <br />
<br />
This being said I think Blizzcon this year will have some things to offer.<br />
The reveal of a new WoW expansion is kinda set in stone, but maybe we are about to be surprised with SC3, WC4, D4, another new franchise, another movie, heck only they know for sure what's going to be there. (Probably not even all of them)</div></div><hr />

So you wanted them to tell about some other raid even though they have one unpublished raid? C'mon if you spend your time watching all the youtubers who make content out of ptr then you prolly shouldn't be suprised about the gamescom.

Lets set this to rest like right fucking here and now kids/teens are NOT playing this game anymore. The game's ever dwindling presence is due precisely to that fact. I just so happen to work with college age kids, and my wife works with high school age kids. They don't play... WoW is not cool, it is not current. They aren't the least bit interested.

<br />
Precisely, GAMES, they showed movies. No real new stuff, I'm not butthurt over what kind of animation it was, couldnt care less.<br />

But it was a pointless presentation, they showed nothing and tried to present it as something awesome.</div></div><hr />

I think that the trailer for the patch as a whole was one of the better ones yet, although my favorite will always be Zul'Aman trailer followed by Throne of Thunder. It looked a lot like a proper trailer for something like a movie and it worked very well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just hired a bunch of people for an unannounced Diablo project that is probably just getting going full steam on development and the Necro pack just came out for Diablo 3 so what do you really expect till Blizzcon or most likely next year at the earliest?<br />
<br />
A new class announcement wouldn't be crazy, if the Necro pack is selling well - there's a lot of interest for a Druid class. I don't expect anything about the new game for a while, but D3 still has a little life left in it. Probably right, though, that the game is in maintenance mode - they have a small team to tweak things and run the seasons, but I wouldn't expect more than another character pack for D3.<br />

Problem is, they didnt reveal anything. There was more information to be had at their preview this monday, the overwatch short could just've gone up on youtube.<br />
<br />
It was a wasted presentation that they called &quot;Blizzards biggest gamescon yet&quot; .... I mean dont hold a presentation when all you have is minor stuff, show it off of course, but dont hype it up like this.<br />
<br />
They were talking about the size of their booth, and that they were holding a bunch of events, not JUST the presentation. They split an entire hall with Sony, they have like 8 large booth areas covering all the games. <br />
<br />
The butthurt that there was no expansion reveal is fucking hilarious. Didn't get that pony Blizzard never promised you, huh?</div></div><hr />

Yep. The necro pack probably sold well enough for them to justify making another class pack for D3. Even if they add stuff into D3 just to test them out as a basis for a future game, kinda like using D3 as a guinea pig lol.</div></div><hr />

Eh what? I never expected an expansion reveal, I did however expect something more interesting than a few videos when they hyped it up themselves, so what if they had a big presence, they had a &quot;reveal ceremony&quot; that basically revealed 2 animated short stories for preexisting stuff.

Where exactly was the big reveal?<br />
<br />
For Blizzard, as a whole. Not just WoW. <br />
<br />
There was new things for almost all their games. Plus Blizz don't ofen have mega stuff at gamescom, so it isn't hard to be their &quot;biggest&quot; (Outside of the xpac announcement)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teri</div><div class="date">2017-08-23, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">0 Diablo content was the only surprise. <br />
<br />
But if there's some big announcement for diablo to come, just like the other &quot;big&quot; announcements, they are probably at blizzcon, cause the stuff here were just &quot;small&quot; updates, not on the scale of expansions imo.<br />
<br />

A &quot;waste&quot;. So literally nobody enjoyed it, or got anything from it. LOL. Okay! <br />

<br />
The cinematic team is getting very, very, very good, I will gladly give them that. The writing isn't at Pixar levels, or Sony levels (Tangled, Frozen), but they're definitely up there art and design-wise. They're also very slow. To do more than the shorts they do, they'd need to hire a Pixar worth of people, and buy a render farm as big as Pixars. I'm not saying it can't happen, but until they expand that team and buy some serious hardware, I don't think Pixar has anything to worry about.</div></div><hr />

Where exactly was the big reveal?<br />
<br />
Just because they said is the &quot;biggest&quot; doesn't mean they are going to reveal their new IP game or something similar. It just mean that they have more presence on the COM unlike other events except for Blizzcon this is one and probably the only one that Blizzard have a bigger presence, not even on E3 they have had this much presence.<br />

They did announce Legion on Gamescom 2015, people suddenly assume they were probably doing something similar.</div></div><hr />

was an attempt to cater to this imaginary &quot;younger generation&quot;.<br />
<br />
You're also suggesting that the &quot;selfie cam&quot; and Twitter integration were also an attempt to wrangle the younger crowd? Except that by your own admission these attempts failed. Which would mean what exactly?.... I'll give you a second to work it through. Okay time's up. That this evil &quot;younger generation&quot; doesn't exist.<br />

If your reply was worded in a less hostile way then my reply would not have been as overboard as it was and I am sorry for that but most people on this forum have no sense of civil discussion anymore..</div></div><hr />

Hostile... well you got me there.<br />
<br />
On the other hand you're not exactly a saint. You're calling an entire group of people tools. For doing nothing except being themselves. As if they or any of us has any real influence on the development process. Given the steady decrease in player engagement, you would think, that if catering to casuals was the root cause of that... they would have backtracked a long time ago.<br />
<br />
The more I talk with people, the more I see the remaining players can prove they've been here since before 2007. I would venture to say that of the active player base, an overwhelming portion are those that pride themselves as &quot;veterans&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can also tell you that the things the &quot;young&quot; crowd gets blamed for... like LFR. Are not things &quot;casuals&quot; asked for. I am certainly glad it was/is there, as it has kept me playing since cataclysm. But I committed to a weekly raid schedule/regiment Vanilla-WotLK. The people that are most satisfied with LFR are people like me, who finished college, started careers, started families, and added other responsibilities to their lives.<br />
<br />
The real irony is someone like Ghostcrawler who admits that LFR was his project, his brainchild, gets deified, and players get the blame, hatred, and vitriol spewed at them. Its completely irrational.<br />
<br />
The bottom line though, is two fold.<br />
<br />
(1) If you're angry with design direction Blizzard, and only Blizzard is to blame. If they have read changes in demographic, changes in player/customer needs, ignored or misinterpreted trends... that is ALL Blizzard. I've been here long enough to see that even IF Blizzard agrees with community outcries for change... the end result is some bastardized version of something we never asked for.<br />
<br />
(2) We need young people. Any hobby needs new blood to keep it going. Nobody stays interested in something forever. People get bored, people get frustrated, gain other interests... the last thing anyone who values the longevity of Warcraft should be doing is blaming and shaming the few young people that exist and who have shown interest.</div></div><hr />

I agree with everything you have said and do admit being way to reactive on my part, (really I should know better being 49 years old I should be more mature than I act sometimes) just that what one sees here tends to get one worked up with the constant bemoaning of the game from some on this site.. Maybe some of what is wrong with the game is valid and some not.. But in most cases it is just complaining just for the sake of complaining.. <br />
<br />
And true that the game needs a constant influx of new players to keep it going, but in some cases those new players might get scared off with how some of the community acts towards others it does not really help..<br />
<br />
Anyway in the end I plan to not be as aggro and reactive as I have been and hopefully I stick to it.. :)</div></div><hr />

At least they are signalling to people like me to not give them their money anymore. Hard to believe this is the same company that made Diablo 2 (even though no one who worked on that game still works at Blizzard).</div></div><hr />
