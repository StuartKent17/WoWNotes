Blue Posts<br />
Lack of CM Communication<br />
What's wrong to post more information about the game, and be more open? I see there are many Blue post welcoming their new colleague... but none of them are talking and interacting with us.<br />
It's worth keeping in mind that the forum is just one part of our responsibilities as CMs. This article (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/b20/interviews.html#thirdInterview) (click on Community Manager / Editor) gives a good insight into our day to day.<br />
<br />
In the interests of transparency I’d also like to briefly run through some of the other things we do, besides the forums. This will hopefully give you an idea of our rather varied workload:<br />
<br />
<br />
Creating/Localising/Publishing of content (Blogs, social media, etc.) Reviewing and forwarding feedback (from forums, social media, e-mails, fan sites, etc.) Interaction with players (through digital platforms as well as in person at events – Hellfest for example) Contests and Giveaways Planning and execution of events (Launch events, GamesCom, Road to BlizzCon, etc.) Supporting fan sites, bloggers, streamers, YouTubers, competition and event organisers (Fireside Gatherings, BarCrafts, etc.), pro gamers, cosplayers and other artists – basically all the people who are active in the community. <br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see, it’s a very varied list of tasks but all of the tasks directly relate to the community as a whole. There’s never really a shortage of work that needs doing.<br />
<br />
Although we are reading the forums every day to stay informed about trends, suggestions and feedback, please also keep in mind that the forums are primarily intended as a way for everyone to discuss the game amongst themselves. <br />
<br />
Now that being said, I do intend to interact with you as frequently as I can. If you have any questions after reading this, please don't hesitate to ask. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/389418-why-cant-blizzard-employee-talk-more-often/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16070657464?page=2#31))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
content designers create quests, partially? noticed an opening for an associate is why I'm curious. I'd guess darkmoon too?<br />
Spawning, quests, encounters, events holidays and otherwise. Yeah, that general range of things. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/649474148746461184))<br />
<br />
(Normal Hellfire Citadel hotfixes)<br />
itch if it doesnt stay easy and then progression is ruined for those that dont want a blow through on normal<br />
The thing is, these changes won't make the actual intended audience &quot;blow through&quot; normal. If you crush Normal, do Heroic. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/649633451193184256))<br />

Blizzcon - Wil Wheaton<br />
In case you missed it when it was originally posted (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5095-BlizzCon-2015-Virtual-Ticket-and-Goody-Bag-Available-Patch-6-2-2-Release-September-1), Wil Wheaton is hosting the Blizzcon contests this year! <br />
<br />
He posted a blog post (http://wilwheaton.net/2015/10/stay-awhile-and-listen/) about getting ready recently and spent the day at (https://twitter.com/wilw/status/651473233452011521) Blizzard (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/651553191729860608) today (https://twitter.com/TerranGregory/status/651583073646080000).<br />

I like him. I really enjoy his TableTop series on YouTube. I mentioned that he was going to be there to some friends of mine and they had the opposite reaction I did so I guess you aren't alone. I'm actually kinda excited because I get to go this year so I have a chance to meet him.</div></div><hr />

Ive seen him in person at many conventions I attend and he always &quot;Im better than all of you attitude&quot;. Maybe that's just me though. Either way, that with the fact he just played hearthstone and just installed wow and still hasnt played it kinda seems like something you might wanna do long before you decide to host an event. I bought the virtual ticket and i plan on watching it, its just a poor host choice in my opinion. Still far better than Jay Mohr though.</div></div><hr />

dont get me wrong, I LOVE BLIZZ, i stand up for blizz on more things then they prob deserve :P, it's just that Wil Wheaton on more then one occasion has gotten so high of himself that he has totally neglected others, + he is a HORRIBLE actor and even bloody paradise hotel people would outshine him on that part.</div></div><hr />

They want to hear &quot;We fucked up WoD, you were right, we're going to immediately get on removing LFR, reinstating hardcore tier progression, taking out CRZ, reverting all Cataclysm changes, putting up vanilla WoW servers, and nerfing the ilevel of everyone who didn't earn ahead of the curve achievements in the first month of the raid's release.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2015-10-07, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember reading a magazine article from like 1988 about ´the internet´... and in it they mentioned just a few things you could do like email, IRC and they mentioned that one of the most active websites was something like diewilwheatondie.com I don´t think it was him, it was just the character he played on Star Trek, both annoying and also someone you would be jealous of if you were around the same age. <br />
<br />
I generally don´t dislike child actors who grow up to be a little cocky.. It is difficult to put yourself in their shoes, but I can almost guarantee that if I were in the movie Stand By Me and also was on the tv show Star Trek, I would probably have some issues keeping my own ego in check. that is a lot of attention he was receiving before he was old enough to process it.<br />
<br />
I like his table-top channel on youtube and don´t find him annoying at all. I think he needs some better PR skills though. You should never take over something like Blizzcon and then admit you never played WOW, you are just asking for some greif. best not to say anything and play a little.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, no. He's a professional nerd - or, in other words, someone who makes a living off of presenting as a nerd. Whether he's actually a nerd or a poser is beside the point, what he most definitely is not is &quot;like the rest of us&quot;. These media-darling nerds who try to remotely &quot;connect&quot; with nerds of all stripes through their persona are actual cancer on the community. We don't need or want them, and Will Wheaton - whose claim to fame is having been a secondary character on the shadow of proper actors - can fuck off and keep peddling his bullshit to the drolling, hashtagging bigbangtheory crowd.<br />

He seems to have some attention issues and awkward social awareness that just gives me a bad vibe when I see him interacting with others.</div></div><hr />

I like him in general. I'm curious, is there a particular reason or he just rubs you the wrong way? (Genuinely asking.)<br />

He doesnt play blizz games<br />
He's pretentious as hell<br />
He's pretends to be nerdy for money<br />
He's always been a terrible actor<br />
And he's a notorious SJW in a time where blizz fans are worried blizz is going to much in that direction.</div></div><hr />

Its more so that many of those at blizz who do talk typically end up putting their foot way up their mouth or in Holinka's case, show how ignorant they are.<br />

Fans want blizz to be open and at the same time not be a collection of dicks.</div></div><hr />

Honestly though, with the amount of penny-pinching Blizz is doing in WoW... I'm kind of surprised they still bother. The only ones people even remember were the ones that were completely awful. Just have a CM do it.<br />

My mage is glad for the Dragonwrath fix. Having to make sure Ice Block is off CD when I approached a zone boundary was tiresome. The one time I used slow fall even more so, ended up in the adjacent zone!</div></div><hr />

I wasn't a fan of Jay Mohr (nothing against him, just didn't find him funny), but I would have far preferred him over Wheaton. Hell, why don't they get some funny people who were or are big in the WoW community, huge fans etc. like Jesse Cox? I don't know if he could manage hosting the whole show, but he sure as hell is a huge fan of them and a great guy and he's got cred.<br />

A better choice would be Felicia Day. She's played the game, is a real gamer, has personality, and is well liked by most. I think she'd have fun with it (if she'd be interested, no clue)<br />

I love the CM non-response here:<br />
<br />
Players: Could you guys talk to us more?<br />
CMs: We have a lot to do, that has nothing to do with the question.<br />
<br />
But, they're not going to come out and tell the truth - Blizzard is on lockdown when it comes to communication. And that's probably for the best, considering how much they've fucked up in the last year any time they opened their mouths. They do not have good communication skills, and without GC managing the wildfires in the forums, there's no point in saying anything, really.<br />
<br />
But they could find a better way to explain that. &quot;We're busy&quot; is kind of rude - as community managers, you'd think they'd want the players to feel like they're valuable, not just something on their To Do list, and pretty far down the list, too. Like &quot;Hey, I feel ya, I'd love to talk more with you, but we have a lot to do here, on a daily basis&quot;, not &quot;We're busy. We might get to you, or not. You're not a priority&quot;. <br />
<br />
It's something that baffles me to no end. Blizzard cannot seem to communicate without being rude - even if it's not their intention, they just can't speak on anything in a friendly, open way that doesn't come off as dickish.</div></div><hr />

Ive seen him in person at many conventions I attend and he always &quot;Im better than all of you attitude&quot;. Maybe that's just me though. Either way, that with the fact he just played hearthstone and just installed wow and still hasnt played it kinda seems like something you might wanna do long before you decide to host an event. I bought the virtual ticket and i plan on watching it, its just a poor host choice in my opinion. Still far better than Jay Mohr though.<br />

I haven't really gotten that vibe from him, but fair enough. At least we can agree that he's better than Mr. Mohr.</div></div><hr />

Eh, I don't know Ms. Day's work well. I do know that Aisha Tyler has done comedy skits on her geeky interests, she's very funny, she's different. Hell, she 's on one of my mother's day time hen-clucking shows and hosts the new version of &quot;Who's Line?&quot; - she's mainstream. Something Blizz could definitely do with - some positive press going into the film. <br />
<br />
I do agree it's the best move to just say nothing. I also tend to believe them when they say they're busy. I don't think your latter is how it was intended.</div></div><hr />

See, now, dem's fightin' words.<br />
If Wheaton is disliked for making a living off playing the nerd card over an acting gig he took as a kid, Day is even more disliked for being a grown-up faux nerd peddling an image of what it is to be a nerd that plays into every sad stereotype and yet is just mild enough to get advertisers to tag along.<br />
<br />
&quot;b-b-but, she actually played WoW&quot; - so did millions of other women, younger and older. Many women have even made playing the game or talking about playing the game into a lucrative hobby or profession. But for them the focus is on the game itself, not on the person behind the keyboard.<br />
<br />

If she's a footnote, what does that make you, an ink smudge? Are you guys kidding me with this nonsense? <br />
<br />
There is no requirement to like celebrities or be excited that someone specific is hosting Blizzcon but the amount of text in these comments disparaging their work and careers is fucking ponderous, man.<br />
<br />
They took things that they love (and there is little room to dispute that Will &amp; Felicia are INTO the things some of you all dismiss as pandering) and turned them into businesses that produce content that a lot of people like and employs a lot of people. They work hard and take a TON of crap from all the true scottsmen who troll around on the internet. Grow up already.</div></div><hr />

I thought Metallica were quite a good choice IMO. Only couple I didn't like was Tenacious D never been a fan of em personally same with The Offspring (damn that was years ago). As for Wil I usually follow him and will be watching the contests as I do each year. Although last year was insane with the Shek'zeer costume so I'm expecting something really badass to top that! :)</div></div><hr />

Your absolutely right. And that, by the way, is also exactly the reason he doesn't host Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

the last time I went 2 years ago it was Blink 182. the interaction with us felt so... forced.<br />

I'm kinda into those 2 so unfortunately gotta conflict with you here :). Although Blink 182 did feel forced I'll admit that like they didn't wanna be there at all.</div></div><hr />

I'll give him credit for once though, he admits he hasn't played WoW/Hearthstone when he could have faked it and easily gotten away with it. He really is a fake nerd though, a huge liberal-to-a-fault^H^H^H^H^Hasshole, if they wanted a fake nerd that bad they should have gone with Jim Parsons.<br />
<br />
If they reconsider they should put in their WOW/Starcraft figurehead Chris Kluwe as host, that guy cracks me up.</div></div><hr />
