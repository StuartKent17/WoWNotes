BlizzCon Tournament Coverage Streaming<br />
We are pleased to announce that this year, for the first time, all of our streaming tournament coverage for BlizzCon will be available in both high-resolution and low-resolution formats, and you can choose whichever fits your available bandwidth. The BlizzCon website (http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon/tournaments/) will host one stream featuring StarCraft and Warcraft III events and another dedicated to World of Warcraft. As in previous years, all of this streaming tournament coverage will be provided free of charge. Be sure to tune in to find out which teams and players are the best in the world by visiting the BlizzCon site (http://www.blizzard.com/blizzcon/tournaments/) on August 21 and 22.<br />
<br />
To clarify, the tournament coverage streams are free, but to watch panels, see new announcements as they are made, or receive the in-game pet, you will need to order the Pay Per View Internet stream (http://blizzcon.rayv.com/). <br />
<br />
BlizzCon Badge Confirmation Emails<br />
BlizzCon is coming and so are “BlizzCon 2009 Badge Confirmation” emails. It is important for all attendees to print and save these emails in order to pick up your purchased badges at the event. These emails are being sent in waves, so if you haven’t received confirmation emails for all of the tickets you purchased yet, please be patient. They should be arriving within the next 24 hours and are coming from a PNMI.com address. Be sure to check your “spam” or “junk” email folders in case your confirmations were directed there.<br />
<br />
In the days to come, the bar codes contained within these emails should also be available for viewing through the Battle.net account with which you purchased your tickets so you can verify you have all of the bar codes associated with each badge you purchased.<br />
<br />
We look forward to seeing you all at the show! <br />

Blue posts<br />
Instance servers are full!<br />
We have known about this for awhile, that is why we have been pointing out that the solution(s) are not as simple as buying a new stick of RAM and being done with it overnight. It took a lot of investigating and planning before we could physically do something and now that we have plans, they still aren't something that we can do very quickly and easily as we want to try and make sure it is done right. <br />
<br />
[...] The instances being capped isn't something that is surprising. We intentionally implemented this cap because after a certain point when too many instances were active they would all run into various issues like lag. As much as this is an issue we want to solve, we feel it is a better situation to have a large number of players enjoying stable instances instead of nobody able to play anything. We aren't happy with the fact that having these stable instances includes preventing others from getting into instances, but that is why we are working very hard on a more long term solution. <br />
<br />
[...] My guess is simply based on the idea that when major content patches launch, you tend to see people play more than they were the couple weeks before. The point is mainly that patch 3.2 won't resolve the issue as the fixes that are being worked on are more on the hardware side. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/18704857925-instances-full-come-32.html))<br />
<br />
Currently we are trying to find ways to minimize or (hopefully) completely get rid of the issue. Not everybody runs into this capacity issue, but we understand the frustration for those who do encounter it. <br />
<br />
Measured Battlegrounds<br />
We aren't reluctant to do a measured battleground system - we are, in fact, at work on one. However, measuring individual contributions to a battleground is a much more difficult prospect than our previous measurement systems. Having to rate each player in a 10 to 40-man fashion requires a varied and versatile tool that is capable of capturing defining moments in battleground matches and player contributions throughout the game. This is not an easy prospect. It is something we've been working hard on for some time and we hope that it will come to fruition sooner than later.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we don't have a date as to when this will be added to World of Warcraft. Rest assured, this is something we want to see added to the game as much as our fans do. Once it is in place, we will all breath a collective sigh of contentment... just before we leap to our desks and join the queues to begin bashing our way to the TOP!

<br />
Adding an underwater dungeon to the game?<br />
We typically never throw anything completely off the drawing board when it comes to conceptualizing fun content. I think there would have to be a good opportunity for a water dungeon in the game first, but more importantly, we'd have to really make sure it would be done right and feel fun. Under water combat can be a little chaotic, especially when using any sort of ground-targeting spell. We wouldn't want to come out with such content were it to feel like the game play would suffer from the format of the setting.<br />
<br />
In a way you could relate it to our decision to remove flying vehicles from Wintergrasp. It sounded awesome and was, in some cases, pretty fun. But it just didn't feel right or balanced with the way it was implemented, made the zone even more chaotic and really fell short of providing the player with the physical sensation of being in flight.

Living Bomb on 3.2 PTRs<br />
The intent, as of this writing, is that Living Bomb ticks that crit will proc Hot Streak. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18697257498-confirmation-on-livingbomb-tics-procing-hs.html))<br />

Changes to Affliction<br />
We are unlikely to revert the SL or Immolate changes. If Affliction's damage ends up being too low, we would be more likely to address it in other ways. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18983418654-revert-changes-to-aff-plz--ty.html))<br />

Tanking as a warrior<br />
If warrior MTs are standing aside because DK OTs can handle the fight much better, and this is happening for a lot of encounters, then that's a problem. If it happens for a few encounters it's probably not a problem and if the advantage the DK conveys is modest, it's not a problem. This isn't an issue of how many warrior MTs there are. It's an issue of whether one class has a much, much easier time on certain encounters. DKs probably had too easy a time on Sarth +3 and Vezax.<br />
<br />
The second issue is: should we nerf warriors because there are so many warrior tanks and we want other tanks to be more common? I think most reasonable people, including us, would say that's a bad reason to nerf someone. However, players also infer a lot of design intent to our actions. We've finally gotten to a point where there are 4 classes that can serve as your raid's MT. If we turned around and buffed warriors a lot while nerfing the other classes, players might mistakenly assume that we want the warrior to be the &quot;real&quot; tank, which is certainly an understandable conclusion given that it was the design for the first 3-4 years of WoW.<br />
<br />
Now, where I think I lost some players in the thought process was in a discussion combining those two issues (power and representation). If druid MTs are so much better than warrior tanks, then why don't we see more of them? Furthermore, why aren't warriors stepping aside for druids on those fights where they are currently (in 3.1 I mean) stepping aside for DKs? Maybe there are just a lot of DK tanks because the class is new (and has at times been overpowered). But why aren't there more druids if they are a superior tank on many encounters? Do we nerf druids anyway, knowing this will probably lead to there being fewer of them? What if they don't really convey as much of an advantage as players think? Now we've made an unpopular spec weaker.<br />
<br />
Players sometimes (and often depending on the argument they are trying to make) argue that representation equals power. There is a correlation there, but it's not 1.0. These things are rarely black and white. I think sometimes some players try to distill everything down too much into rules like this. You can't feed variables into a computer and have it spit the right answer back out at you. That's not intended to be a criticism of player logic powers, more of an explanation of why we sometimes might view things differently. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/18697257056-the-problem-with-balancing-by-representation.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the living bomb change is a little confusing, if you read the original post the blue quote doesn't directly answer his question. If there is a FB crit &gt; LB non-crit &gt; FB crit I don't think hot streak would proc the way it is explained. Or is the intention that only 2 LB crits in a row would proc hot streak and be totally separate from FB crits? The first scenario seems more likely but that might make Hot Streak proc less than it does now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redwuppie</div><div class="date">2009-07-31, 05:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Regarding Tank representation between the classes:<br />
<br />
Warriors can perform 2 roles - Tank / Melee DPS<br />
Death Knights can perform 2 roles - Tank / Melee DPS<br />
Paladins can perform 3 roles - Tank / Healer / Melee DPS<br />
Druids can perform 3(4) roles - Tank / Healer / DPS (Melee) / DPS (Ranged)<br />
<br />
Making an assumption of even distribution of CLASSES then roles within said class, you should see about half the number of Druid tanks to Warrior or Death Knight tanks. (all assuming even distributions).<br />
<br />
Factoring in that Druids perform the healer roles and you probably have a skew to even fewer Druid tanks due to many druids speccing Restoration.<br />
<br />
On top of all of this is the fact that &quot;style&quot; or &quot;flavour&quot; may push people to certain classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dk and Warrior can play only 2 roles.<br />
Dk is new, Dk is a few better than other class (blizzard want to incite player to make DK, normal) So we see only Warrior Tank, Because Paladin and Drood are all healer.<br />
<br />
Blizzard don't understand the RP role of the warrior and why all people make warrior. they nerf,nerf,nerf and nerf again.<br />

This happens extremely regularly on my server, as well as many other US servers. (The problem is so pervasive on my server, my guild and several others have had to cancel raids some nights because we can't get Ulduar to even launch for a couple of hours of attempts.) Anecdotally, it seems like the EU servers run into the issue less, and are getting hardware upgrades to eliminate what few issues are being had. The US just gets told they'll fix it someday and has so far had no hardware upgrade downtime.</div></div><hr />

Yup, sucks when you try to power lvl friends or solo-grind rep in outland instances, which always seem to be down.<br />
<br />
The underwater dungeons could be pretty cool, if not awesome, a cave type dungeon would fit perfectly with Maelstorm and it unconfrimedness. Just hope it's nothing like BFD's cave, could be more clustered with big huge opening for bosses, would love it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I got from that is:<br />
Blizzard: We know tanking is unbalanced, DK's Fuckin rock, but if we change stuff people will get mad, and we don't want that. Instead we will post some random bullshit that completely avoids the problem and hope people are at least temporarily satisfied with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fact: Warriors have sucked as tanks ever since Burning Crusade came out. They were always behind druids in terms of survivability, Now warriors are debatably the worst tanks falling behind DK's, Druids, and even Paladins in my opinion. (Sure warriors have more powerful cooldowns at the moment however just from a survival standpoint paladins have greater block, HP, and passive spell reduction)<br />
<br />
The more I play this game the more I believe a bunch of politicians are deciding changes rather than game developers. Its getting a little sickening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids in bear spec, even with a decent cat gear, don't do that much more DPS than a prot Warrior in dps gear. And for fights like Thaddius, you even have to stay in your tank gear to deal with the initial two targets (well at least back then when this was difficult content)<br />
<br />
Besides, even though Blizz claims not to build raids around it, there is Dualspec. Every tank and healer has that.<br />
<br />
It shouldn't be a matter of only bringing one MT for the whole instance, but (as far as possible) equally using the tanks available. Different fights require different tanks, which might be determined by class, or simply by gear difference - still, a slightly undergeared Bear might be the better tank for a hard-hitting boss with adds - he isn't prone to &quot;damage spikes&quot;, while the other classes can deal with the multiple adds better.</div></div><hr />

They will atleast do triple what a prot warrior in dps gear and not getting rage from being hit will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure all fights are doable with any kind of tank.<br />
For example me, as a paladin tank, I tanked Vezax hard mode before, tanked Steelbreaker hard with warrior before, me being the last tank.<br />
It's about making fights easier and progression tanking.<br />
Like when you do Vezax hard for the first time, you would prefer to use a DK on Vezax, just because makes the learning attempts easier...</div></div><hr />

1. a 10% bonus on your tanking seal doesn't suck for a 2 set imo, but that block value one is arguably crappy. <br />
2. 5 minute cooldown 60% damage reduction and a last stand. yours is only 3 minute cooldown and does a 50% reduction, its only drawback is forbearance. you also get a last stand/cheat death type deal in 3.2 which is better than ours. <br />
3. yours is still higher even if it doesn't count for anything :O. more SoR damage--&gt;threat?<br />
4. the aoe taunt is not a taunt, it forces everything to attack you for a few seconds but does not push your threat above everybody else's like a taunt does. I'll give you the aoe stun part, even if it is hard to get things in a frontal cone ahead of you. <br />
5. spell reflect doesn't give passive spell reduction for when its on cooldown.</div></div><hr />

1. Noone said the 2 piece was bad did they? At the same time however, its not exactly good.<br />
2. At the moment your cooldowns are Undeniably FAR better than Paladins. Wether in 3.2 the cooldown is as good as (warriors) claim it to be, we shall see.<br />
3. Yay, block value...wooo, you should really have a similar amount to a paladin though, you take the exact same gear pieces so i dont know how the paladin would have more.<br />
4. Why dont we call it an AoE mocking blow then? It is probably THE ability that a paladin lacks, its far better than you are letting it sound like. P.S. the stun is not remotely hard to use<br />
5. You have the same spell reduction as paladins, so what is your point?</div></div><hr />

And this is exactly where you think wrong. You don't get to tank every fricken boss just because you're the best geared tank, or because you're a warrior. It doesn't matter that much.</div></div><hr />

Warrior need a good tier8 bonus just to keep up with other tanks.<br />

paladin aoe threat is much more stable then a warrior with thunderclap peaks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pa4eto</div><div class="date">2009-07-31, 12:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really hope that Blizz guys will be able to find a balance. It just not right to have 4 classes that can do MT but you basically see 80% DKs, Warriors rest 20% are paladins &gt; druids. Yeah, surely I do not play on all the servers but all the movies I have watched (tankspot, youtube) I see nothing but DK, Warr or paly tanks. This is a bit sad due to the fact I am one of the tanks for my guild (its a small guild but all are friends and we are doing fine this way). I can definitely say that my druid tank (full naxx25 gear) around 34k hp unbuffed, 39.5% dodge, 28k armor is pretty much always neglected to the same gear comparatively to other tanks (from the mentioned above classes). Well at this point I can only show few arguments:<br />
<br />
1. Druid should have a bit more HP - In fact this is not entirely true, Plate items can give you much more +stats. And I really doubt that our +25% stamina bonus should be the place to aim. Anyway stamina does not give you mitigation. So if we are comparatively 1.5-2k hp more than other class I doubt that you will be preferred as MT.<br />
<br />
2. Mitigation - unfortunately, we don't have much of a choice here. We got only dodge. I can definitely say only cause I am in fact aiming dodge% more and I still cannot have more than 44% (incl my Mongoose proc) on raid wide. Well put it this way dodge % + parry % + shield block (for pallys and warrs) + armor &gt; druid % + armor. Thus I can surely say druids are neglected if you have other tank option for raid. It is a bit sad cause we still spend badges / tokens for gear that will not help you at all to survive or give you a chance to MT.<br />
<br />
3. Yes about threat/aoe - we are doing fine here (esp on boss encounters). Unfortunately, we still miss some of the start boost on threat that other classes have (pallys HotR, warriors bloodrage + charge/SA, DKs D&amp;D, DG). <br />
<br />
4. Why our +dmg is actually based only on AP for our skills. Actually as a druid you got option to go for Sta or Agi bonus. I really doubt that you'll have place to enchant/go for AP since you are still below other tanks as mitigation or hp. <br />
<br />
5. Please enlighten me on possible balance here. It seems Blizzard guys have &quot;noticed&quot; that there is not much balance as tank options but any idea of balance will be much appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

For example me, as a paladin tank, I tanked Vezax hard mode before, tanked Steelbreaker hard with warrior before, me being the last tank.<br />
It's about making fights easier and progression tanking.<br />
Like when you do Vezax hard for the first time, you would prefer to use a DK on Vezax, just because makes the learning attempts easier...<br />

You talking about 10 or 25? Tank 25 steelbreaker with 2x prot paladin and tell me it's doable.<br />

Remove the damn AoE on all tanks and remove the AoE of dps that didn't use to have it...they should stop making a classes having the same exact abilities with different name. Also don't blame Blizz if you don't know how to hold agro while others do with same class/specc.</div></div><hr />

In 10170, I can do between 3300-3400 DPS w SoV on boss dummy, which is really bad compare to my 3600 on live. However, I just tested with the same exact set up in 10179, I did between 3900-4000 DPS everytime. Which is more inline with what blizzard said about buffing ret pve dps.<br />

Warriors have AoE threat? ;)<br />
<br />
I started tanking on my warrior recently and I know what you mean. While I am certainly not tanking raid content, I also have experienced Paladin and DK tanking in the same situations and I much say... Warrior tanking requires quite a bit more effort. Thunder Clap, Shockwave and Demo Shout are fine if people aren't AoEing, but as soon as Blizzard goes off, &quot;Target Changed!&quot; will pop up ;). <br />
<br />
Although I'm not sure why people are so hell bent on AoEing either.... I play my Warlock in the same situations and I find AoE extremely mind numbing. I'd rather single target DPS everything :P.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The underwater dungeons could be pretty cool, if not awesome, a cave type dungeon would fit perfectly with Maelstorm and it unconfrimedness. Just hope it's nothing like BFD's cave, could be more clustered with big huge opening for bosses, would love it.<br />
<br />

<br />
All I got from that is:<br />
Blizzard: We know tanking is unbalanced, DK's Fuckin rock, but if we change stuff people will get mad, and we don't want that. Instead we will post some random bullshit that completely avoids the problem and hope people are at least temporarily satisfied with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fact: Warriors have sucked as tanks ever since Burning Crusade came out. They were always behind druids in terms of survivability, Now warriors are debatably the worst tanks falling behind DK's, Druids, and even Paladins in my opinion. (Sure warriors have more powerful cooldowns at the moment however just from a survival standpoint paladins have greater block, HP, and passive spell reduction)<br />
<br />
The more I play this game the more I believe a bunch of politicians are deciding changes rather than game developers. Its getting a little sickening.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors are fine at the moment. Currently it's DK &gt; Warrior = Paladin &gt; Druid. Next patch it looks like Warrior &gt; Paladin &gt; DK &gt; Druid.<br />
<br />
If anything we lack some AoE tanking power but with the buffs to block next patch that won't be as much of a problem because of Damage Shield ( http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=58874 ).</div></div><hr />

This is all down to a L2P issue. Cleave is a warrior ability and is actually very good. You also need to get glyph of cleaving to increase max targets from 2 to 3.<br />
<br />
Btw when people ask for an underwater dungeon they want us to be in the water fighting mobs, not in a cave. These are the same people who want player owned housing. They just want little novelties for LOLs and don't care much about real content.</div></div><hr />

...and druids where not suppose to be the strongest tanking class...<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you kidding? Druid is actually something like hybrid/not entirely one-tree or whatever class:<br />
- Druid melees dps is not aimed to be more than rogue any other class dps<br />
- Druid restorarion skills are not made to be stronger than priest / resto shammy / paladin healer classes<br />
- Druids are not supposed to be better tanking class...<br />
<br />
Bigsampson, I don't know but according to you druid class should be deleted right? What is our aim for then - seems we are class for nothing!?! I can definitely say that I am sick of being last option tank and always healer. If I wanted to be healer, I should have created shammy or priest since they are always sought as MT/OT healers. Druids are mostly raid healers/HoT stackers. <br />
<br />
Put it this way: Every single class has three skill tress. That means you should be able to play two different roles for sure (e.g. every single class can be dps, right? however, few other classes can be healers/tanks as well). So at this point I wanted to play druid tank and that's what I want to do. I picked up healer spec for the simple calculation that at the moment druids suck at tanks due to the mentioned before reasons and they suck at dps due to other classes strongly dps. So wtf - we should only heal cause noone else want to heal?! <br />
<br />
I do not agree that druid should be so bad as tank (last from all other tank clases). Since we have tank tree, we should be able to tank as good as every other tank. Yes, there are exceptions at some fights that needs different class but cmon... that doesnt mean druid should never tank at all. <br />
<br />
So bigsampson, whatever you are player/afker/child/hater ... you should be able to see all other classes and accept their purpose for the simple reason that they are made for what they need to do. If it was up to you, there shouldn't be MMORPG at all. <br />
<br />
All I want to say is that Blizzard should consider balance for tanking classes not that EVERYONE from you mentioned DK &gt; warr=pally &gt; Druid or Pally &gt; warr &gt; DK &gt; druid. Seems druid is considered by all the weakest one. Isn't that a bit strange ? Well, it might not be strange but its at least NOT BALANCED! That's what it is...</div></div><hr />

We have known about this for awhile, that is why we have been pointing out that the solution(s) are not as simple as buying a new stick of RAM and being done with it overnight. It took a lot of investigating and planning before we could physically do something and now that we have plans, they still aren't something that we can do very quickly and easily as we want to try and make sure it is done right.<br />
<br />
[...] The instances being capped isn't something that is surprising. We intentionally implemented this cap because after a certain point when too many instances were active they would all run into various issues like lag. As much as this is an issue we want to solve, we feel it is a better situation to have a large number of players enjoying stable instances instead of nobody able to play anything. We aren't happy with the fact that having these stable instances includes preventing others from getting into instances, but that is why we are working very hard on a more long term solution.<br />
<br />
[...] My guess is simply based on the idea that when major content patches launch, you tend to see people play more than they were the couple weeks before. The point is mainly that patch 3.2 won't resolve the issue as the fixes that are being worked on are more on the hardware side. (Source)<br />
<br />
Currently we are trying to find ways to minimize or (hopefully) completely get rid of the issue. Not everybody runs into this capacity issue, but we understand the frustration for those who do encounter it.<br />
<br />
---I cannot accept this answer from blizz. As paying customers, instances were something we were able to enjoy prior to wotlk problem free. It was a service and a selling point blizz offered from the get go. For blizzard to introduce the instance cap is plain frustrating. I do understand why they are introducing this cap and I think it is a reasonable idea, however, when the new patch comes out this cap would essentially limit x-percent of players from enjoying the new contents. This answer is too general. Blizzard has been given months to resolve this issue and they are still keeping us in the dark in regards to a clear answer on how they are going to resolve it.<br />
<br />
From a business stand point, this is unacceptable. If blizzard wants to keep their customers I'd suggest they provide us (the consumers) a detailed plan and time frame as to how they are going to resolve this issue and when they will implement their solution. I also feel that Blizzard is unsympathetic. I do not think their staff or CEO knows what its like to try for 20+ minutes to get into an instance. (I know it is a bold statement to make that comment about their CEO, but given how long this issue has lasted and the frustrations I have to dealt with, I do not make any apologies for that comment). Furthermore, I feel that blizz is treating the new patch like a crutch to keep the players they have now and to allow them more time to fix the instance cap issue rather than address it with full force.<br />
<br />
I feel robbed. I feel cheated. I was never a gamer, but I play WoW to stay in touch with my family in the military and overseas. Running raids and instance are a big thing for us and we look forward to it every week. But when we are denied that service because of Blizzard's inability to resolve this issue in a timely manner, then I think maybe its time to move on. Find something else more stable and something we can all enjoy together instead of wasting 20+ min of our time trying to get into an instance and wasting away our $$ for a service that blizzard can no longer effectively provide. <br />
<br />
In essence, I feel that I am being punished for blizzard's inept handling of the situation.<br />
<br />
I think I should be reimbursed for the time wasted not being able to enjoy the contents that was promised, but I am not going to ask for that. I want no apologies. I want no robotic responses. What I want is a game plan from blizzard. TELL ME HOW YOU ARE GOING TO FIX THIS AND WHEN YOU ARE GOING TO DO IT!!! QUIT BEING GENERAL AND QUIT FEEDING ME BULL S**T!!! The blizzard staff that posted this comment is just restating what the others staff have said in the past minus the stupid sad faces. :( I am getting to the point now where I think we are talking to robots and not humans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After reading a lot of the comments here, I feel as if I am one of the few people who has actually seen a good druid tank in Ulduar 25 man gear. Raid buffed pushing 50k hp, 58% evasion after DR, along with 30~k+ armor without inspiration or all that jazz. Simply put they are the second most survivable tank under any normal high physical damage situation. Druids hold their own at tanking, from my experience AOE threat wise it is DK&gt;Paladin=Druid&gt;Warrior. A druid complaining about a 700 dmg AoE threat ability on a global cooldown needs to open their eyes realizing that warriors get an 800 dmg AoE on a 6 second cooldown as their MAIN aoe TPS grabbing ability.<br />
<br />
It may be a little late, but for those who commented on paladin block being a negligible difference between warriors and paladins, I was merely trying to point out that a Warrior vs a Paladin in comparable gear, the paladin will take less damage and more consistently. That is just the difference between having &quot;holy shield&quot; and not having it. Sure, warriors have &quot;shield block,&quot; but a 25% uptime on that is in no way comparable to a paladin's 100% uptime on a skill that increases their chance to block by 30%, and with the libram it even increases block value by a decent amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors are fine at the moment. Currently it's DK &gt; Warrior = Paladin &gt; Druid. Next patch it looks like Warrior &gt; Paladin &gt; DK &gt; Druid.<br />
<br />
If anything we lack some AoE tanking power but with the buffs to block next patch that won't be as much of a problem because of Damage Shield ( http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=58874 ).<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior &gt; Paladin next patch? Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems to me prot warriors are getting a threat increase next patch when it is their survivability that is their biggest problem compared to other tanks. Both warriors and paladins are getting that block value buff except paladins will also be receiving a 2 min cooldown &quot;cheat death&quot; type ability and the changes to Argent Defender adds a virtual 10.5% onto prot paladin HP. But yes, warriors will be getting a superior threat buff compared to paladins even though our threat is being increased too due to the reworked seals + block value changes.<br />
<br />
Honestly the most exciting change I see warriors getting is double the damage on devastate, so perhaps they won't be lowest DPS tank class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess you are absolutely right here. I doubt that every single druid tank is like this. Due to the simple reason not every guild got resources (ppl) to run Ulduar 25 and I've never seen pug with Ulduar 25 and neither will due to the simple fact it requires some thoughts and gear rather than just pressing buttons. <br />
<br />
And one more think, just comparatively - how does a tank from any of the other classes will look like (as you have seen so much) with the same full Ulduar25 gear DK/warr/paly ? I guess overall mitigation (dodge,parry,block,armor) will be much more than druids, right? And as far as I am reading your comment you never played druid tank... so why you bother writing? <br />
<br />
Also one more thing that blahism is absolutely right: have you seen the gear options and tier bonuses for druid tank? I will just point out the difference (in benefit to other tank classes of course - full T8.5 gear set lvl 226 items):<br />
+ 167 Sta<br />
+ 390 Str<br />
+ 7138 Armor<br />
+ 165 Dodge<br />
+ 98 Expertise<br />
+ 41 Hit<br />
<br />
Note: I skip those bonuses that druid cannot benefit from.<br />
<br />
So, in what world do you play SnugglyFoo? Guess you are only watching movies on YouTube ;D Everyone here is talking about balance, you are point some example seen on YouTube. C'mon open your eyes and see the things. I wish there were more opinions from druid tanks here but the simple fact that there are no druid tanks is clear proof that we are very much incapable of gear up/tanking in comparison to other classes.</div></div><hr />

The fact that druids share gear with rogues makes it so that much of your gear has low stamina on it, and stats like armor pen, as opposed to the well defined &quot;tanking plate&quot;, which is what some other people were referring too.<br />
<br />
Also, though I know many druids are resto/kitty/boomkin and many paladins go dps/holy, you have to compare when tanks are used and why. I feel that if almost every guild is using a DK when learning a fight then something is wrong balance wise. If you put up a tank when you are learning a fight and actually want to clear it, you are going to be using your best over all tank. Though the druid has multiple (4) roles, I feel that the warrior/paladin/dk should be on equal ground at least, with druids trailing by a small amount (even less when geared). Not here to argue who is the best or not, but it just doesnt make sense that some guy or girl that spends the time to know their class and gear their character is just told that they cannot tank their boss or hold aggro on multiple mobs because someone in blizzard decreed things don't work that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">killah</div><div class="date">2009-08-01, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Warriors are popular to main tank as they apply sunder stacks (meaning dps warriors dont have to break their rotation or watever) and also because they are useless at aoe compared to the other tanks who can lay down an aoe, or spam a move which hits everything in a 360 degree radius. Yes, warriors &quot;can&quot; tank bosses, but for bosses like vezax, as has been said, they just cant. Last stand is not a CD for that fight.<br />
A lot of high-end guilds have had warriors as their ongoing MT's since Vanilla, if those warriors have stuck with the guild, then they should have a cetain &quot;pull&quot; within the guild and experience tanking to back that up. It is only when guilds formed during lich, or were slightly not as hardcore and needed a tank (DK) who was basically godmode (50% IBF, 50% Bone Shield, Massive Armor and HP.)</div></div><hr />

Word.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Druid melees dps is not aimed to be more than rogue any other class dps<br />
- Druid restorarion skills are not made to be stronger than priest / resto shammy / paladin healer classes<br />
- Druids are not supposed to be better tanking class...<br />
<br />
Telling from your first line, in your second one you probably mean &quot;not [...] as good as&quot; when you say &quot;not [...] stronger&quot; - all the &quot;healer&quot; classes are hybrids, so why the &quot;hybridism&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, he means &quot;not [...] stronger&quot;. All healers are hybrids, and thus should all be equal (at healing). All tanks are hybrids, and thus should all be equal (at tanking). Only some dps are hybrids, and thus the dps that can NOT change roles without leveling 79 more times deserve to be slightly stronger at that role than those who can change roles by just a gear and spec swap.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pheneom</div><div class="date">2009-08-03, 10:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right.. I agree that a lot of warrior tanks are bitching. That I can understand. Warriors have to get hit for rage generation and threat building. BUT 1 on 1 boss fights.. Warriors are better. <br />
<br />
BUT.... and there is always a big &quot;BUTT&quot; somewhere... When you get multiple mobs like in a HC.. it gets harder. Warriors do need to be positioned where they dont get hit from behind which some instances, some mobs do regular from time to time.. UK and UP. VH &amp; CoS.. to name a few. <br />
<br />
Making sure you can spam thunderclap and shockwave as much as poss. The main problem I can see it getting multiple hits off at once. Cleave can help bth.. its shit.. Whirlwind in the Berserker stance it better for that. it hits all of them (mobs). BUT, changing stances in mid fight = u loose aggro. if you can get sword and board to proc more often with the right combo for devestate and Revenge.. U get ur free sheild bash. That is a high amount of threat and dmg per hit and proc.<br />
<br />
I still feel that prot warriors need to be able to have Thunderclap more AoE affective (ie like a pala Conseqcration with more dmg or bigger and logger hit duration in mob fights.) and whirlwind usable in prot.<br />
<br />
Again. Since TBC.. warriors have been neglected and Nerffed too many times that I might just roll a pala and fuck my warrior off.. Giving devesate more CRIT in the next patch. erm.. might be good but Warriors.. need some thing good for tanking and dare I say it, rethinking.... Fury warriors in PVE.. do some serios dmg. PVP = arms and blade storm... well it rocks.. BUT.. Tanking.. Its been neglected.. Even Blizz has admitted that they have neglected warriors.. Blizz, can you START listening to us warriors for change....</div></div><hr />
