<br />
All About Tournaments<br />

There is a double-elimination bracket, so watch out!<br />
Team rosters are 4-player, but you can sign-up with 3.<br />
All series are best-of-5.<br />
Tournament Mode is required; all gear is normalized and honor talents and artifact power are maximized<br />

Teams who earn points are allotted one roster swap without consequences.<br />
After the free swap, there is an automatic 50% reduction to your points tally.<br />

Want To Run Your Own Tournament?<br />
We would love to see more of these! The more community involvement the better and there are some seriously solid reasons for doing it.

If you’re interested, here’s what you should do: read the guide, fill out the application form (https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/QH7J0750E2KT1490206134230.pdf) and send in it to us. If you have any questions about running your own event, get in touch (wowesportsadmin@blizzard.com). We’re here to help and want you to create as many community events as it’s possible to have.<br />

Anduin's Questline - Where's the Horde part?<br />
Having been keeping tabs on this over the weekend I realise my original post really missed the mark. In my haste to post the details we received about the intent of the Anduin cinematic I didn't really do a very good job of addressing the points (other than AP) that had come up in similar discussions on the internet. It wasn't my intent to come across as disregarding, mocking, sarcastic or anything of the sort with my original post. I'm sorry if it came across that way.<br />
<br />
We definitely hear that Horde players would like to see more story development for their faction following the events of 7.0, and likewise we understand that players of both factions are hungry for more story development in general. Both of those points were also included in the feedback we collated and forwarded regarding this topic, and will continue to be included going forward. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1059004-anduins-questline-wheres-the-horde-part/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17615462531?page=8#148))<br />

Hayven Games<br />
The Hayven Games channel has lots of videos that explore World of Warcraft, look at the history, and other interesting information about the game. <br />
<br />
Hayven passed away from epithelioid sarcoma on the 18th of March 2017, at 26 years old. All earnings from Hayvens YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjVDQloX4cIpGqpM6mdyD2Q) and Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/hayvengames) will from now on be donated to cancer research. <br />

It's spooky how optimistic he was right up until he died. You'd expect him to gradually waste away over the course of a few months but no, he was still active and saying he thought he was going to pull through less than two weeks before he passed away.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind the top end is Time-countered by the mission counters. In other words if you don't want to lose your champions for 12 days you have to counter the time obstacles.</div></div><hr />

I just wish the WoW community would half, no, even quarter as great as Hayven, Fred was and everyone would be so much better. He was a positive and optimistic young man, and he deserved so much better than a little corner in a post. Everyone who knew him loved him. He left such a positive impact in everyone. <br />
<br />
He deserved more in this life. Like with tons.<br />
<br />
He has an online petition for bringing Hayven into WoW as an npc. I leave the link here, but please don't be malicious even if you don't agree. That is your choice, I respect that but this isn't the time for personal feud. The petition: https://www.change.org/p/activision-blizzard-bring-hayven-into-wow</div></div><hr />

I couldn't agree more-- I can't believe he's gone at such a young age, I didn't even know he was sick :( I was fascinated by his 'how it really looks' series and he seemed like a really good guy. Blessings and condolences to his friends and family.</div></div><hr />

Horde got the extra stuff after broken shore scenario, with Sylvanas becoming the warchief, Vol'jin funeral and all that while Alliance got nothing other than turning in the quest to the npc.<br />
<br />
Now they've decided to actually do something about that for Alliance and people cry about it?</div></div><hr />
