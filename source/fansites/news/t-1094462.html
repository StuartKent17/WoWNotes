Diablo III PvP Update - PvP Arena System Postponed<br />
As we’re counting down the days until we’re ready to announce a release date for Diablo III, we’ve come to realize that the PvP game and systems aren’t yet living up to our standards. Today, we wanted to let you know that we’ve made the difficult decision to hold back the PvP Arena system and release it in a patch following the game’s launch. After a lot of consideration and discussion, we ultimately felt that delaying the whole game purely for PvP would just be punishing to everyone who’s waiting to enjoy the campaign and core solo/co-op content, all of which is just about complete.<br />
<br />
While we work on making sure PvP lives up to its full potential, we hope you’ll find some consolation in the fact that soon, you’ll be having a blast leveling characters, finding items, learning the classes, and perfecting builds…and that when the Arenas do arrive, you’ll be all the better prepared for battle.<br />
<br />
When the PvP patch is ultimately ready, it will add multiple Arena maps with themed locations and layouts, PvP-centric achievements, and a matchmaking system that will help you and your team get into fairly matched games quickly and easily. We’ll also be adding a personal progression system that will reward you for successfully bashing in the other team’s skulls.<br />
<br />
We know a lot of you are looking forward to PvP, and we’ll be focusing our post-launch efforts on making sure the Arenas are as brutal, bloody, fast-paced, and awesome as we know they can be. In the meantime, we’re in the process of putting the finishing touches on what we think is a truly epic campaign and co-op experience for launch.<br />
<br />
We’ll have a lot more info to share on the PvP system in the future, and we look forward to the moment we can get the game into your hands.<br />

Spell Resistance Removal<br />
There were two primary problems with spell resistance.<br />
<br />
First, the mechanic was implemented in a really confusing way. We could describe it all here, but it would take paragraphs, so instead we invite you to look it up on one of the fansites. The way a point of resistance leads to decreased damage is not an easy system for even experienced players to understand. We certainly could have redesigned the system, but to what end? Gearing for resistance sacrificed so many other stats that it was really only beneficial on those fights that the designers decided ahead of time would be &quot;resistance fights,&quot; which generally meant getting a whole set of Nature (or Fire or Shadow, etc.) resistance gear. It felt more like an annoying speed bump to being able to progress to the next boss, rather than a fun challenge.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the various resistance auras were passive things you'd just throw up, and pretty easy for any group larger than 5 to have. In designer parlance, we balanced around the assumption of their presence, rather than them feeling like awesome bonuses when you got to use, say, Fire Resist Aura. There isn't a ton of interesting gameplay there.<br />
<br />
As we said in the blog, in some alternate universe, we could imagine a World of Warcraft itemization design where resistances are nearly as meaningful as stats like haste or crit. In that game there would be a lot of mobs that cast spells or use magical attacks, and stacking resistance might be an interesting trade off to stacking Stamina and armor. In the abstract, resistances could be cool. They aren't currently very cool in the actual World of Warcraft. We could spend a lot of design attention to make them cool -- and maybe someday we'll take that challenge on again -- but for Mists, we'd rather spend more attention on making sure the talent tree and spec revamps are as cool as they can possibly be. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218608-missing-out-on-scroll-of-resurrection/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4142246808?page=12#224))<br />
<br />
Conquest and Valor Points Cap<br />
There is often a razor’s edge between optional and mandatory. While earning a little more Conquest or Valor might feel like an option for a player who has some free time at the end of a week, it feels mandatory for a Gladiator-type PvPer or realm-first raider who wants to stay competitive with other players at that level. And of course, whenever we bring about the possibility of earning gear faster, we have to assume that players will take advantage of it. To use an extreme case, if you could complete all of your Conquest or Valor gear in one week (even if it took you nearly all of your waking time to do so), then PvP and PvE would have to be balanced with that level of gear in mind, in addition to the fact that players who quickly consumed the content by finishing their gear progression so quickly would then be looking around for something else to do.<br />
<br />
We do try to balance time investment with skill in the game. If there was no reward just for playing (time investment), then only the most skilled players would win Arenas or BGs or kill raid bosses and there would be no catch-up mechanism for the rest of us. This would demoralize and discourage players from participating, and the highly-skilled players would have no one to oppose in the BG or join in raiding.<br />
<br />
Of course, if we overly reward time investment, then the value of skill gets diminished, which is very unsatisfying. The design we typically follow is to give the most skilled players the opportunity to accomplish things first, but let other players get there by eventually acquiring the gear and familiarity to accomplish the same (boss kill / acquisition of desirable piece of armor / achievement).<br />
<br />
But we don’t like it when players run out of things to do. That's something that is always on our list of things to do to improve WoW. We’re not sure that removing caps is the right solution. We have discussed ideas like having diminish returns on Valor and Conquest, such that you always could earn more, but at some point the effort per reward becomes less and less desirable. Maybe under that model very dedicated players could continue to earn additional points, without creating a new standard for everyone. It’s tricky though, because we have to go with an option that doesn't quickly slide into something that feels mandatory.

<br />
Stat Changes Philosophy<br />
I'd like to jump back in here to address a common concern we've been reading, which is that we're trying to oversimplify the stat system in an attempt to appeal to a broader audience.<br />
<br />
One of our design philosophies is: simple to learn, difficult to master.<br />
<br />
We don’t believe in obfuscating information just to create a barrier between players who understand the rules and those who don’t. We do like to have lots of depth to our systems however, and we’re totally fine with veteran or knowledgeable players knowing a lot of nuance, exceptions, and tricks to the basic rules. To use an older example, armor penetration wasn’t our most shining moment in item design. At the base level, it was pretty easy to understand (physical attacks do more damage). However, the way a point of armor penetration rating translated into damage was mathematically complex. And to make matters worse, it was such a good stat that it made sense to stack it even if you didn't understand the mathematical basis for why it was a good stat. Armor penetration was difficult to learn (what does it do?) but easy to master (it’s overpowered). You can make similar examples with &quot;capping&quot; block for paladin and warrior tanks.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, haste and crit aren’t that hard to understand. Haste is &quot;you can do more.&quot; Crit is &quot;you do stuff bigger, but not 100% of the time.&quot; The depth comes from deciding if your play style is more about doing lots of stuff, or about occasionally getting bigger heals and hits. If you’re intolerant of randomness, then crit might be unappealing. If you run out of mana a lot as a healer, then spending mana faster through haste might be unappealing. Both stats can impact rotations as well, depending on individual spec mechanics. These are the types of stats we feel add a decent amount of depth to the system in terms of how you want to build your character, yet they're quite easy to understand on a fundamental level. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218357-dev-watercooler-question-about-stats/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4138433949?page=14#272))<br />

Mists of Pandaria Priest Development Status<br />
Prayer of Healing can be used by Holy and Discipline once again. We realized that the goal of making Holy Nova an effective AE healing tool was problematic. It meant that we would have to change Holy Nova so thoroughly, that it was becoming a second Prayer of Healing. Remember: we aren’t even in beta yet, and we want to retain as much opportunity as possible to respond to player feedback throughout the rest of this process. Things will change for priests, and every other class, over the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
There is some speculation that Discipline is intended only as a PvP spec or only as a tank-healing spec. Neither of those is our design intent. Both Holy and Discipline should be effective at group healing or single-target healing, and if we do our jobs right, both can have a role in PvP. The main difference between them is that Discipline relies more on absorption mechanics, such as Power Word: Shield, Power Word: Barrier, Divine Aegis and the new Spirit Shell. Holy priests should place more emphasis on heals over time and have more area healing mechanics (e.g. Circle of Healing, Holy Word: Sanctuary), but those are intended to offset the incredible benefit of absorbs and not to make Holy the only option for handling AE damage. We see both in use a lot in PvE in Cataclysm, and we intend for that model to continue. <br />
<br />
So does that leave Holy Nova on the cutting-room floor, or is it just going to remain like it is now, useable by both specs, but never really used?<br />
At this time, we don't have an update on Holy Nova for Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
Will Prayer of Healing still be restricted to affecting one group per cast or will it be a &quot;smart&quot; heal that prioritizes on health of those around you similar to Wild Growth?<br />
It looks like Prayer of Healing is going to continue to work as it does today.<br />
<br />
Give binding heal back to disc as well... <br />
There is certainly a chance. At the moment, Discipline doesn't have Binding Heal because we want the specs to play differently (not just vary by Circle of Healing vs. Penance and similar spec spells).<br />
<br />
This, friends, is why we need to be vocal about things as early as we possibly can.<br />
I respectfully disagree. As I said above, there is a difference between feedback that comes from pure imagination (&quot;I've not played this yet, but I can guess how it might feel&quot;) and feedback that comes from hours and hours of actual gameplay. The latter is much more preferable and helpful, and can only be gotten during beta testing.<br />
<br />
We recognize that change is always scary. It’s probably impossible for us to make a change that is universally acclaimed by all players (or even just one group of players, such as priests). We try to make the best decisions for the class, and that includes seeking feedback from interested players, but these things are perpetually a work in progress, and not everyone can be pleased.

<br />
PvP and Gear<br />
I feel like I should take some time to better relay the development team's intentions when it comes to how PvP stats will work in Mists.<br />
<br />
There are two important changes to PvP itemization coming:<br />
<br />
1. We're splitting Resilience into an offensive and defensive component.<br />
2. All players will have at least 30% damage reduction versus other players.<br />
<br />
If you want to do more damage to other players in Mists, you have two options. You can get better PvE gear with more offensive stats, or you can get better PvP gear with slightly smaller offensive stats built in(because PvP gear is lower item level), but which will also give you more damage against players specifically. In today's game, stacking PvE gear is really the only way to do more damage to other players in PvP since Resilience only supplies a defensive bonus. These are completely made up numbers, but imagine PvE gear is 100% effective in PvE and 75% effective in PvP. PvP gear is 50% effective in PvE, but 100% effective in PvP -- despite its lower item level, it wins out over PvE gear when used for its intended purpose.<br />
<br />
Here are some examples:<br />
<br />
Ders the rogue: wears PvE gear.<br />
Jillian the hunter: wears PvP gear.<br />
In Cataclysm PvE, Ders does much better damage than Jillian in PvE, because her PvP gear “wastes” stat budget on Resilience.<br />
In Cataclysm PvP, Ders does better damage than Jillian for the same reason. However, when Jillian hits Ders, he doesn’t mitigate her damage at all. The result is high burst damage on both sides.<br />
In Mists PvE, Ders still does better damage than Jillian, because his higher ilevel PvE gear has more offensive stats. The difference is smaller however because Jillian’s PvP stats aren't part of the item budget.<br />
<br />
The item level difference is the main distinction.<br />
<br />
In Mists PvP, they both do about the same amount of raw damage to each other, with a slight edge for Jillian. Her power stat offsets Ders's PvE stats. Jillian takes less damage because of her PvP Defense (let’s say it’s 50% damage reduction), but Ders still has 30% damage reduction innately, so he doesn’t blow up either. Again the difference is smaller. If Ders wants to get serious about PvP, he’s eventually going to want PvP gear, and Jillian will want more PvE gear to do PvE.<br />
<br />
Another way to think about it is that we are pushing PvP and PvE gear closer together with two changes: A player in PvE gear always has some base PvP defense (it's like a little PvP gear for free). A player in PvP gear can do more damage and healing than today in PvP because of the new Power stat (it's like a little PvE gear for free).<br />
<br />
Right now, if you walk into PvP using PvE gear, odds are there are some dudes that aren't wearing any resilience at all that you can probably blow up. On the same token, even when fighting players that have resilience, your raw output is higher compared to them, because you have more raw dps (or healing) stats on your PvE gear.<br />
<br />
In Mists, everyone will be a bit tougher, so even fresh PvPers aren't as likely to get insta-gibbed, making pure PvE gear less useful straight out of the gate. At the higher end, a PvP geared player will both do more damage in PvP and take less damage in PvP than a player in similarly powerful PvE gear. <br />
<br />
So, right now, there isn't an alternative to using awesome PvE gear in PvP. A great PvE trinket beats anything from PvP. In 5.0 a trinket with PvP stats should beat out a PvE trinket in PvP.<br />
<br />
Legendary items might be an outlier, because legendary items are legendary, and the additional item levels will probably make them competitive with PvP items. On the other hand, we also expect legendary items to be *much* more rare than they are currently, so they'll also be less of a factor. <br />
<br />
When you state that PvE gear will have a higher item level than &quot;equivalent&quot; PvP gear, are you referring to normal or heroic raiding gear?<br />
Perhaps I misunderstood the question? I'm referring to gear, in general. If we were to compare introductory PvE gear with introductory PvP gear, the PvP gear would have a lower item level, but would be stacked with lots of 'free' PvP Power and Defense that don't count against that items item budget. In reality, it would be just as, if not more powerful than the equivalent PvE item, but exclusively for the purposes of PvP.<br />
<br />
Have you ever considered implementing a stat on PvE gear that's reminiscent to PvP Power and Defense, but for PvE scenarios? For example, a stat that increases damage dealt to non-player characters only?<br />
In a way, this is already the case. There are stats that are of great value in PvE that are extremely sparse in PvP items, and also extremely weak in PvP. Hit is a good example. <br />
<br />
That sounds great, honestly. I just wonder how committed you (Blizzard) is to this concept.<br />
Well, we aren't particularly happy with the way some of these PvE burst trinkets (Cunning and Vial in particular) have worked out in PvP. Future trinkets aren't likely to follow the same model, though we do want to make trinkets powerful and interesting when we can. We can make PvP trinkets compelling by (just for example) doing things like offering proc or on-use effect to provide PvP Power, much as we already have equivalent PvE trinkets that proc strength or spell power.<br />
<br />
If we still run into issues with out of control trinkets, then we have levers we can pull, like adjusting the internal cooldown, or reducing the spikiness of their output. Either way, allowing Cunning of the Cruel to be so dominant in PvP qualifies as a misstep.<br />
<br />
I'm trying to get my head around it, would you say PVP power in a sense is like +100 damage against undead enchants, or more of a Res pen?<br />
Think +damage, not penetration. Your PvP Power isn't less valuable if your target isn't already stacked with PvP Defense. <br />
<br />
What about healers? How do they fit into this equation? Can healers just wear PvE gear?<br />
PvP Power will increase the healing done to other players in PvP situations, so no worries there. <br />
<br />
Should we expect PvP will involve a lot of 10%--&gt;100% healing and 100%--&gt;10% damage then? <br />
We want healing to scale with PvP Power, but that doesn't mean that bonus healing has to scale at the same rate as bonus damage from PvP Power. Again, we have levers we can adjust to make PvP feel good.<br />
<br />
I have a concern that the model you're suggesting won't be able to deliver on the two-fold promise of keeping 'PvE gear out of competitive PvP' and 'reducing the barrier of entry.'<br />
That's an understandable concern, and it's true that as gear gets beefier tier by tier, it gets harder for new players to step into the fray, but even then, the innate defenses coming in Mists should help a lot. We're also aiming for the power curve from un-geared to geared level 90 player to be flatter than it currently is at 85, which should also help.<br />
<br />
We want the PvP community to grow, so at least one of the goals here is to let players cross over more easily into PvP than they can today. That said, we're not expecting a just-dinged level 90 player to step into a 5.3 BG and smash face against dudes in stacked PvP gear. I'm pretty sure that's not what you guys want either. We do want someone who's moderately geared to have a much better chance in Mists than he or she does in today's PvP environment, though.

Diablo + PvP = My brain is full of f*** (hell, i played D2 for like 9 years and all the PvP around was forever-porting wizards or guided arrow amazons, while the rest was a bunch of lvl99 going into open games and bashing low level players for no reason) Again, i welcome the PvP stats changes - makes the gearing process less of a pain while keeping distinctively better the appropriate gear for PvE and PvP. Resilience does a good job, but it's only defense, that's why people goes after pve weapons/trinkets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvP will never achieve any sort of balance unless everyone at all skill levels has the same gear level/stats. How much easier would balance be if gear wasn't another slider on the scale of power?</div></div><hr />

+5% Stats: Any Druid, Any Paladin, Any Shaman, Any Monk <br />
+10% Stamina: Any tank spec <br />
+10% Melee/Ranged: Any melee dps spec <br />
+10% Spellpower: Any caster spec including healers <br />
+10% Melee Haste: Any melee dps spec <br />
+5% Spell Haste: Any caster spec including healers <br />
+5% Crit: Any spec that greatly benefits from critical strikes (Example Fire Mages Hot Streak)<br />
+5 Mastery: ?<br />
-12% armor: Any melee spec including tanks <br />
+4% physical damage: Any melee dps spec <br />
+8% spell dmg: Any caster dps spec <br />
-10% phys dmg done: Any tank spec <br />
-30% casting speed: Any spec that can't interrupt.<br />
-25% healing received: Any non-healing spec. (Currently it would suck but since they are removing majority of the healing spells from hybrid classes it should be fine)</div></div><hr />

Had to bold the crucial part since people dont realise im talking about diablo pvp :rolleyes:<br />
Just look at it this way, pvp in Diablo 2 when it was still fresh and enjoyable was a big part of the game. The idea about it wasn't all that well thought out and organized, but there is nothing saying that the ones working on the pvp-enviroment for Diablo 3 isn't going to make it good.<br />
<br />
All in all, if they enchance the experience of pvp from D2 and revamp it I think alot of people would care about pvp in the instanced Diablo 3.<br />

It will drop ~6months after release, and bliz will promise all the features that players requested be in it from D2 (and more). What will actually be in the game will be far less though, and they will need to buy the first true expansion pack, at ~12-18 months after release to get the rest of those features. The PvE content in the first expansion will follow a similar model as wow's, promise X, Y, and Z; but only X will be done at release, Y and Z will slowly trickle out (ie: actually be made by the devs) in the following months.</div></div><hr />

You sound like a terrible Blizzard hater. How can delayin pvp to refine it sound like its going to be imbalanced? You sir, are an Idiot and a troll.

You DO NOT KNOW for what reason they are delaying Arena: maybe to bring more balance to classes, maybe - for sole cosmetic purposes. Blizzard has already stated that Diablo 3 will be PVE (can stress it enough) oriented game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

No just the same old tired it'll be better next expansion drivel. Diablo 3 in development for over 5 years and go back this last year and look at how many features have been removed. I won't even touch the splitting of star craft 2 into 3 game for the purposes of milking the customers. Bottom line blizzard has poor management with a mediocre development team / teams. Just another game they are trying to push out to stop the bleeding that wow is causing.... No worries that it isn't really even finished.

Next xpac, same crap &quot;we're fixing the new talent system...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Wich is the same excuse for not giving new player models, etc... &quot;we're fixing the crap we just created by unecessarely messing with stuff&quot;.<br />
<br />
And they're really losing it on the pvp thing. They're still not getting the problems of their new &quot;philosophy&quot;, they just copied the system of another game and instead of exactly doing it (copying), they tried to change it... they are so happy claiming about the base defense for the fresh 90, but forget that the geared 90 will also have that base defense + what they have for free in their gear. Other games with this pvp stat system (working not only for dmg reduction) don't mess with the gear, giving free stats, etc. Healers will be even more powerful since they will have all the &quot;pve stats&quot; needed + extra healing, if they balance the pvp power for healing, players will prefer more pve stats and throw away their lovely system (even reforging all that crap into pure pvp def if they allow it). Since they don't want their new stat neglected, they can't nerf the stat that much... so...<br />
<br />
One of the complaints when they released the resilience system was that without a further class/spec balance, it was just staying alive to provide more fun for the other guy. Instead of dying to a rogue in a stun lock with a few globals, you would stay alive a few extra globals just to watch the guy ripping you apart a little bit more. The same crap will happen again... base defense just to see the other guy (that you can't dmg because he does have all the base pvp defense + the huge extra from pvp gear) ripping you apart for longer ( because of his pvp power + tons of pve stats on his pvp gear). If by equiping pvp gear, you would start to lose some of your base def (like a diminish return), then they would be into something for the long run... but right now... &quot;take a seat and watch while I rip you apart&quot;.<br />
<br />
Since they keep simplying the game, pvp gear will be way to go for pve (as usual) unless you're really into heroic raiding before the 1 month nerfs. And they said on the last post about it that normal/heroic is for pve peeps that really want to go into pve... perfecting a pve gear for it is part of the process the same way perfecting a pvp gear is for pvp lol. But they're just removing the pve part of the equation.<br />

WoW seems to be stuck in the same thing over and over again...<br />
<br />
If the problem was only gear and stats... and not also unfair distribution of skills, wrongly application of DR for the same cc type (that they love to say like &quot;it's not the same stun...&quot;), excess of passive/free game changing effects (mostly debuffs) for a few classes, etc. it would be fixed a long time ago (just grab the last gear and go).<br />

They're delaying because it's not a pvp game. They won't waste time trying to balance it around pvp. So, saying that &quot;they'll add later&quot; won't make some pvp ppl cancel the order before the release. By the time they realise that it won't change, they alread have the game, played and hopefully wasted a few precious bucks with the real money AH thinking that gearing faster will give them the advantage on the upcoming super balanced pvp arena.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensa</div><div class="date">2012-03-10, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of the reason that Blizzard keeps having to overhaul the PvP system is their refusal to properly separate PvP from PvE. <br />
<br />
Instead of dividing Resilience into Power and Defence, and admittedly homogenizing the game even more by making the difference between PVE &amp; PvP gear smaller (paraphrasing GC here), which ultimately will produce the same results as the current situation once people are geared and not really solve anything they could have tried several better alternatives.<br />
<br />
1) Separate PvP talent trees<br />
<br />
This maximizes the &quot;levers&quot; they have to adjust by creating talents that solely benefit PvP making balancing easier. It also avoids the whole issue of &quot;adjusting&quot; PvE talents that turn out to be over-powered in PvP. When talents have to be designed to serve two very different masters (PvP &amp; PvE), simultaneously, it introduces complexities and compromises that leave no one happy and which Blizzard has demonstrated for 6+ years they can't actually balance.<br />
<br />
This PvP spec would automatically turn on anytime you entered an Arena or BG. And just like wearing your proper Armour type gives you a bonus wearing PvP gear in Arena/BG's would give you a similar bonus.<br />
<br />
As for this not working in World PvP it's not an issue for 2 reasons: 1) World PvP is dead and its doubtful they will successfully bring it back and 2) even if they are successful in bringing World PvP back it was never about decked out 4000 Resilience geared players taking on similar geared players in open environments. World PvP back in the day was largely the result of players being out in the world. Most World PvP occurred in STV or at the entrance to MC and/or at Kargath or durinf raids of Stormwind/Ironforge etc. And most of the time it involved large groups of PvEers in PvE gear. <br />
<br />
This is all technically possible though Blizzard will trot out the old it's too complex for new players to understand they have PvP talent tree BS when it really comes down to their refusal to commit the resources to it.<br />
<br />
2) Challenge Mode PvP<br />
<br />
In conjunction with separate PvP talent trees, OR NOT, essentially eliminate the gear advantage that causes most of the issues to PvP entry by making everyone fight in the same gear as they are doing with the new PvE Challenge Modes in MoP. Clearly skill would be &gt; gear in this scenario and the barrier to entry would be eliminated. As for rewards that could be handled by creating gorgeous sets without stats that could be used solely for Transmorg purposes, new titles, new blizz store quality mounts for 2200 rated teams etc, etc. so there would still be incentives to do it.<br />
<br />
These are just two ways I think they could have made PvP better while simultaneously avoiding the same problems as the past and further homogenization.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This doesn't sound possible. Sure, you could have it only &quot;activate&quot; when it senses that the player is in a BG, but what about world PvP? There's no way to feasibly reduce PvE gear's healing power in that situation, so I guess Blizzard will be formally disavowing world PvP once and for all. Plus, it just feels clunky that my PvE gear &quot;doesn't work&quot; in a BG - what's the lore reason behind that?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skavee</div><div class="date">2012-03-10, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really dislike the the changes in the pvp stats department. It really makes things more complicated and less clear for new players, offensive pvp stats and defensive pvp stats, base damage reduction when getting hit by other players,DR's in PvP, the ilvl discrepancy, etc. <br />
<br />
Id rather flag resilience items as PvP items and normal items as PvE, a PvP flagged item would receive a 25% item level penalty when queueing for PvE content, while PvE items with an Ilvl higher than the current end tier PvP (i.e HC gear and Legendaries) would not be allowed in rated PvP. <br />
This would effective remove most of the OP stuff in PvP(if blizz learned their lesson on DS trinkets) and allowing those 1,2 PvE items that many people use in their gear build to reach certain pvp mandatory stats cap (such as hit) or to replace PvP items that besides resilience don't give a specc worth stat (i.e. mastery for sub rogues on pvp items). <br />
<br />
In the PvE department the Ilvl penalty would effectively remove the ability for players in full PvP gear to queue for endgame PvE content but still allow for previous content if they so desire to experience it. ~Skavee</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lilbuddhaman</div><div class="date">2012-03-11, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Part of the reason that Blizzard keeps having to overhaul the PvP system is their refusal to properly separate PvP from PvE. <br />
<br />
Instead of dividing Resilience into Power and Defence, and admittedly homogenizing the game even more by making the difference between PVE &amp; PvP gear smaller (paraphrasing GC here), which ultimately will produce the same results as the current situation once people are geared and not really solve anything they could have tried several better alternatives.<br />
<br />
1) Separate PvP talent trees<br />
<br />
This maximizes the &quot;levers&quot; they have to adjust by creating talents that solely benefit PvP making balancing easier. It also avoids the whole issue of &quot;adjusting&quot; PvE talents that turn out to be over-powered in PvP. When talents have to be designed to serve two very different masters (PvP &amp; PvE), simultaneously, it introduces complexities and compromises that leave no one happy and which Blizzard has demonstrated for 6+ years they can't actually balance.<br />
<br />
This PvP spec would automatically turn on anytime you entered an Arena or BG. And just like wearing your proper Armour type gives you a bonus wearing PvP gear in Arena/BG's would give you a similar bonus.<br />
<br />
As for this not working in World PvP it's not an issue for 2 reasons: 1) World PvP is dead and its doubtful they will successfully bring it back and 2) even if they are successful in bringing World PvP back it was never about decked out 4000 Resilience geared players taking on similar geared players in open environments. World PvP back in the day was largely the result of players being out in the world. Most World PvP occurred in STV or at the entrance to MC and/or at Kargath or durinf raids of Stormwind/Ironforge etc. And most of the time it involved large groups of PvEers in PvE gear. <br />
<br />
This is all technically possible though Blizzard will trot out the old it's too complex for new players to understand they have PvP talent tree BS when it really comes down to their refusal to commit the resources to it.<br />
<br />

<br />
That is entirely too intelligent, logical, and simple in practice that is possible. (ie: Coding that would take too much work, and might mean rewriting some core code, so therefore we aren't touching it. )</div></div><hr />

Thus far there's little about my beloved priest class that tempts me to return for mists. Still hoping tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Close your eyes, problem solved.<br />
<br />
It's not like troll/orc/draenei/human female art isn't prevalent on here and isn't overly sexualised and almost alien to the very races it represents, either. Yet for whatever reason some people STILL cannot get over their blood elf hatred, even if a vast chunk of the art represents humans/draenei/nelfs very sexualised too. Besides, the two male elves look really good, particularly the Spellbreaker which Blizzard has eliminated from WoW.<br />
<br />
I'd agree with you if you said it's just more lame anime-influenced girly girls with massive tits, that probably has no bearing on how the race itself was portrayed in official concept art. People tend to forget blood elves have very severe, classically good looking features, much like their night elf cousins. I mean look at Azshara's original concept art and the way Kaldorei women tend to be represented in fan art. There was even a Naga with :3 eyes and face on here recently, when their eyes are serpentine and infused with energies. They're frikkin' snake women and still get portrayed that way.<br />
<br />
This is often done well in the elven males but neglected in the females, because most gamer boys tend to prefer little anime tarts. The last picture is actually quite a good representation of a blood elf female, without lapsing into the anorexic, big busted look some artists give females of almost any race. FWIW, I only think the second and last of the females could be considered as remotely blood elven in their facial features. The others are just skinny anime girls with green eyes and long ears/eyebrows thrown on. Often not even that much is drawn on them. They're not really sexy. They look like little girls. And I mean if you think on it, compare the original orcish and troll females to the current ones in-game. Is there even a remote resemblance?</div></div><hr />

Now. Why I hate GC - Volume 429. <br />
I appreciate him and the other designers totally making the game something I don't want to bother with anymore. My addiction was cured thanks to your constant fiddling around and making it not so much fun anymore. You have a PvP focused expansion with more class breaking PvE/PvP balance attempts and the answer isn't really going to cut it. <br />
<br />
Spell resistance - I know how it works, I've played this game since the time we had to farm to beat a boss or you didn't progress and it made the game interesting. It never was too difficult to understand unless you were stupid. The actual reason is they want bosses to lay down faster and aren't really interested in requiring a guild/playerbase to work towards anything other than mechanics that aren't as interesting. I remember having to actually help out my guild's tanks so we could get past Hydross. Omg, it was backbreaking work because all 2 of them had to have it as opposed to the days when 40 had to wear resists and totally held us up and prevented... wait a minute it was something you did. Not like they've required resistance since about BT but that was also about the same time raiding was still a challenge. WoW died this expansion, I hate saying it but they really handed the hardcore gaming audience to Trion and Bioware. That's fine if you're a casual gamer and all, but this crap used to be more fun.</div></div><hr />

Why Resto Druids were left to rot?

Good productive threads get locked due to internet hero's 'trolling' and just derailing threads because hurhurhur it's funny.<br />
<br />
I spent a lot of time over the years posting constructive threads, giving correct feedback and suggestions to fix obvious flaws and bugs and helping alot of people in the process.<br />
<br />
All that came of it was continued frustration and nothing being resolved bar the same old promises of 'it will be fixed next patch', we are aware of this issue and are looking into it, focus will resolve that issue, roll a dk and shut up etc etc.<br />
It get's to the point where you just cannot be bothered anymore, the issue seems that they brush over 'lesser' bugs/issues for another time then another batch of problems turn up and the original ones get pushed down further and further until they are just considered 'working as intended'.<br />
<br />
As to the scroll of ress's.. yeah another clever if not overtly obvious 'gief us some moar monies' business plan. It's a shame they don't spend as much time on the game development as they do on these money making idea's. But i've commented on those already so no need to go back over it again.<br />
<br />
As a long time player *end of vanilla* I don't expect to be given presents everyday and a pat on the back for playing, at the same time I can understand why so many say long time players are overlooked. The company obviously wants to get people back playing so they will offer them more offers and such.<br />
I think one thing that kill's it for some players is when they have something slightly rare, be it a mount/weapon or such.. blizzard have a tendency to make it widely available to everyone.. yes it's just pixels but those pixels do lend for some mild form of originality and status in game.. it goes hand in hand for me with the rehashing of old raids/dungeons. Going a bit off topic here tbh.<br />
<br />
The general feeling I have gotten in recent years is that.. your a long term player and always pay your sub on time or in advance so your a dead set to continue playing out of habit more than love of the game and we don't really need to worry about your issues because you will continue to play. Our main worries are with the players who leave or are playing for short periods of time and shift around to game after game after game... i call these players 'timmy power gamers'.<br />
<br />
But as soon as long time players etc get anything.. the timmy power gamers would flood the forums with OMG IZ NO FAIR THEY CAN HAZ ALL THE STUFF WHY U HATZ ME BLLIZZARD' and blizzard will crumble as usual and give it to them in some lame way to shut them up.<br />
<br />
But such is this game. I've about 2 months left on my sub and I have no interest in pumping anymore money into the company because for me it's just been getting worse and worse and really.. anyone who falls for the things like the recent GC post and the whole propaganda on the next exp.. well.. yeah, you ain't got a leg to stand on.</div></div><hr />
