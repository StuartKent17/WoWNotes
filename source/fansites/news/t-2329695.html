Just speculation.<br />

Just speculation.<br />
<br />
Edit. Also what it says about wows stable monthly users means that there hasn't been subcripstion drops in this patch. Guess the steady pace of patches work.<br />
Now do the magic reductions on those 5-8m for wow. Like you did for others. You know like 50% of those are starters. So it makes 2-3m subscribers for WoW.<br />
<br />
Stable means it's not dropping, as in stabilized. Reached the bottom. You don't brag about it when it stops growing, you know.</div></div><hr />

You know its impossible to speculate how many users wow has because we have no data from them, not active or inactive. 5-8M is what gets left when you take out the speculated amount of players in overwatch,diablo,hearthstone,hots and starcraft. Its extremely unlikely that wow has less than 5M users because of the numbers we are given.</div></div><hr />

Basically, in all the WoW panel. Reveal in the Opening Ceremony, first overview in &quot;Whats Next&quot;, more details in &quot;Gameplay and Systems Deep Dive&quot;, Art and Q&amp;A on Saturday. Everything will be about the expansion, what else would they talk about?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say they're going to make the WoW expansion the &quot;big reveal&quot; at the end of the opening ceremony. (Which is ironic, as it gets the least screen time and WoW is clearly not the priority at the moment) it's also a cash grab move so people choose to buy virtual tickets when they realise that they can't see what's going on with WoW without one...anyway...<br />
<br />
So since that's likely true, 30 or so minutes from the opening ceremony itself, maybe even less than that. then straight into the the What's Next panel, which is an hour long, then the Q&amp;A later on, so yeah, around 2-3 hours on the new expansion, expect 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The opening ceremony never offers up big details. They have like an hour for all their games, realistically every game gets like a trailer and a few minutes of talking. The opening has never given in-depth details of anything, thats what the actual panels are for.<br />
<br />
Its not like the info is hidden after the BlizzCon, you can always read MMO-C news without a virtual ticket, which will repeat any announcements and details provided.</div></div><hr />

I mean, there has to be something wrong with your reading comprehension. Or you know, you're seeing what you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
leading to stable Monthly Active Users for the franchise quarter-over-quarter<br />
<br />
A stable number has neither large increases or decreases, and while it's safe to assume that the number of players is always going to be higher when a patch releases what the earnings call actually says is that in Q3 (which includes the 7.3 release) the MAU was at the same level as in at least Q2 (with 7.2 just released and ToS opening).<br />
<br />
You might not want Blizzard to be doing badly but you most certainly do want WoW to do badly, even if you won't admit it to yourself! ;)</div></div><hr />

What the panel is referring to is more likely to Sylvannas and Jaina, who technically ARE 2 of the most powerful women on Azeroth and they're the key characters of next expansion.</div></div><hr />

I have to wonder what sort of sad saps react like this to the natural in-game story evolving into featuring female characters.<br />
I also have to wonder what sort of PATHETIC saps gets so up in arms and feels so threatened over &quot;powerful women&quot;. :rolleyes:<br />

The fact that an expansion featuring female characters through the natural story progression gets people so riled up, shows clearly why there's a problem with how some people look at women.</div></div><hr />

Ofc they wouldn't realy lie. But they can obfuscate and embellish. Cherry-pick favorable metrics, highlight a few favorable details and bury less pretty things in aggregate numbers. The facts are the facts, but you can own and lead the story[<br />

The Orcs, Tauren, Trolls, Goblins, Blood Elves and Panderan have had fuck all reason to attack the Alliance this expansion (and WoD for that matter was also similar weakass reasoning: The heads of our camp said we should fight the other guys roving around this isle because we got here first and they can't be trusted) not to mention the fight is really between Genn and Sylvanas and their loyalists. I mean it just seems odd that out of nowhere that she wants to attack Stormwind suddenly when she's been hellbent on securing the North of the Eastern Kingdoms and finding something to help her people's state for like the last four-five expansions.</div></div><hr />
