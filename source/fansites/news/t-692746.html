Shadowmourne Changes<br />
The proc of Shadowmourne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49623/shadowmourne/) was slightly modified. The Soul Fragment (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/71905/soul-fragment/) you get from the proc now grants 30 strength (down from 40) but the &quot;final&quot; proc now grants you 270 strength for 10 sec.<br />

The Frostwing Halls<br />
The last wing of the Icecrown Citadel unlocks this week! Valithria Dreamwalker (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=902), Sindragosa (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=901) and the Lich King (see below) will be available!<br />

<br />
The Lich King Encounter<br />
The spells used during the lich king encounter are now available as well. We don't really know how it will work for the moment but the spells look promising. Note: I cannot guarantee that all these spells will be used during the fight against the lich king. <br />
<br />
Also, I do realize that Hellscream's Warsong (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73822/hellscreams-warsong/) and Strength of Wrynn (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73828/strength-of-wrynn/) are spells used during the Battle for Undercity questline, new versions have been added and it looks like they could be used during the encounter. That's probably the only way players will have to survive the devastating attacks of the Lich King. <br />
<br />
They could also be the promised zone-wide (and optional) buffs designed to make Icecrown Citadel easier over time. <br />

Invincible Changes<br />
Invincible's model has been altered and the wings are now much smaller when the mount is on the ground. Please check the Invincible Preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/season-8-armor-sets-season-8-weapon-models) for more details on the mount. (It drops from the Lich King in 25-man Heroic Mode)<br />

Balance<br />
Earth and Moon: This talent now increases the druid’s spell damage by 2/4/6%, up from 1/2/3%.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-shaman/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br />
Elemental Combat<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-warlock/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
Affliction<br />
Shadow Embrace: This effect can now stack up to 3 times, up from 2. However, the periodic healing reduction effect has been reduced from 3/6/9/12/15% to 2/4/6/8/10% per application.<br />
<br />
Demonology<br />
Demonic Pact: The damage bonus granted the warlock by this talent has been increased from 1/2/3/4/5% to 2/4/6/8/10%. The buff granted to a raid or party by this talent remains unchanged.<br />

Protection<br />
Concussion Blow: The damage done by this ability has been reduced by 50%, but its threat generation will remain approximately the same.<br />
Devastate: This ability now deals 120% of weapon damage, up from 100% of weapon damage.<br />
Shield Slam: The damage scaling from block value for this ability now diminishes faster and diminishes starting at a lower block value. The difference should be negligible for players in high-end tanking armor. In addition, the threat caused by Shield Slam has been increased by 30%.<br />
Warbringer: This talent no longer allows Charge and Intercept to break roots or snares. Intervene remains unaffected.<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />

Items<br />
New strength-based melee DPS rings are now available from representatives of the Ashen Verdict.<br />
Tier-9 Sets: The Aspirant vendors at the Argent Tournament grounds have worked out a deal with merchants in Dalaran so that all item level 232 set pieces will now be available on armor vendors in the city. Set pieces which require trophies will still be available for purchase only from vendors at the Argent Tournament grounds.<br />
Tier-10 Balance Druid 4-Piece Bonus: Fixed a bug to allow for this bonus to properly trigger.<br />
Tier-10 Elemental Shaman 4-Piece Set Bonus: Redesigned. Successful Lava Burst casts now increase the duration of Flame Shock on the target by 6 seconds.<br />

Tier-10 Warlock 4-Piece Bonus: This bonus should now correctly be applied to the warlock’s pet.<br />
<br />
Technical Support<br />
The cvar ‘processAffinityMask’ controls which CPU cores are available for the World of Warcraft client to use. Previously the game client was limited to 2 cores as a default which players could override in the configuration file. In the past this provided a performance boost on some CPUs and operating systems. We have identified several systems that are experiencing severe performance issues with this restriction and have removed it. Players who would like to restore the old behavior can do so by updating the Config.WTF file by adding: SET processAffinityMask &quot;3&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tier-10 Tank Armor Changes<br />
We recognize that many plate tanks are making their gear choices based on the amount of armor they’re provided, as this is currently the most preferred stat. In order to make the tier-10 plate tanking sets more desirable, we will be adjusting the stats on the gloves and chest pieces in order to inflate the amount of armor they provide in the next minor patch. This will apply to all item levels of the tier-10 death knight, warrior, and paladin tanking gloves and chest pieces.<br />
<br />
Similar items crafted or purchased with Emblems of Frost will continue to be very good and will compare favorably to all but the Heroic difficulty boss loot, so you shouldn't despair if you recently acquired any of those.<br />

All lv80 pvp sets are still bought with:<br />
<br />
Savage: Heroism emblems<br />
Hatefull: Valor emblems<br />
Deadly: Conquest emblems<br />
Furious: Truimph emblems<br />
<br />

<br />
Spirit Burst is most likely the spell that is used by the Vile Spirits that might spawn during the encounter...<br />

This explains the &quot;Frostmourne&quot; area with all the chains. It might also explain where the Vile Spirits appear, being fought by players &quot;devoured&quot; by Frostmourne.<br />
<br />
As well as explaining why in the cinematic Frostmourne is broken. Perhaps during a phase, some go into the sword and destroy it from the inside out?</div></div><hr />

I know, it's just if everyone performed as well as the top 1/3rd of the raid PUG would have no problem but alas free epics and no skill test attunement also means people who can't play worth a damn get invited to ICC 25. But that's another topic entirely.</div></div><hr />

A nearly shattered Bolvar grasping the fallen crown and grasping the scourge's chains with his will at the last moment.... No... <br />

<br />
Though personally, I liked the cinematic and think that the people who were disappointed at it not being shocking or at it being predictable have only themselves to blame. Imagine watching this having never been to the forums to discuss what may happen, or reading other peoples predictions as they came to a generally accepted consensus as to how the expansion would come to a close. More importantly, imagine never having seen the &quot;Lavaman&quot; model before, as the fate of Bolvar was only known due to people data-mining his model.

Maybe they are going to add the real cinematic before they release the patch on live servers. Because while cinematic is not too bad,it is not as good as i expected either. We don't know what happened before and during the fight,but seeing how surprised Tirion looks to see Bolvar in that form shows us that Bolvar shows himself at exactly that second,meaning he was not in the fight. And all these just doesn't make sense to me. How the hell can he just appear there sitting on the throne ? How the hell they only show Tirion ? Where are 25 people that were fighting with the Lich King ? Where are all the faction champions,leaders and important people who had come there just to help the fight ? Did you see the Ashbringer seathed on Tirion's belt just like a one-handed sword ? It tells something to me,it tells this video was not done with ultimate care. That it was done in a few days for the lols. There are these and a few more things that seemed abnormal to me. For that,i believe this video is only a distraction. I HOPE at least. Because it really was not satisfing enough for me.</div></div><hr />

Well, let's see, we kill Illidan, no cutscene, only Akama says they retake the temple. We kil...ahem...banish Kil'Jaedan, and get a nice little epilogue. We take out the Lich King, and they give us a pretty damn fitting cinematic. Yeah, it's not all that detailed and &quot;omg pyro and parties and lewtz lololololol&quot; It doesn't NEED to be. I think it is perfect. The Lich King dies, and in his final moments, we get Arthas. He knows everything he has done, doesn't ask for forgiveness which he knows he does not deserve, and he accepts his fate. Only asking if it's all over now. And Terenas, being a father, still loves, and forgives his son. Then Tirion, unaware of Bolvar sitting on the throne, is willing to sacrifice himself to ensure the scourge is controlled. Bolvar knows that he is not who he used to be, is willing to be the grand sacrifice by a noble soul. Tirion doesn't want his good friend and brother in arms to have to do that. Bolvar however, wants Tirion to live out the rest of his life however it plays out. Tirion knows this, and Bolvar, is crowned, so to speak, and freezes himself and presumably the rest of the scourge. As for leave now and never return? Who can blame him for saying that? He is no longer Bolvar, he is the Lich King now, albeit a (for now possibly) good one.</div></div><hr />

The ability of NPCs to land killing blows on players has been removed. Any attack that would reduce the player to zero health now grants 100% of the player's health pool instead. In addition, when this happens the player gains 500% increased damage and healing buff for 30 seconds.<br />

The ability of NPCs to land killing blows on players has been removed. Any attack that would reduce the player to zero health now grants 100% of the player's health pool instead. In addition, when this happens the player gains 500% increased damage and healing buff for 30 seconds.<br />

We have applied a debuff to all players in these zones which will decrease the effectiveness of all forms of healing by 10%. This includes heals from items such as Healthstones and potions, however, it will not affect defensive shields or auras. This change is being made to balance the effectiveness of healing against the recent buff we made to the damage reduction component provided by resilience. Rest assured that we will be closely monitoring the effects both the healing and resilience changes have on Battleground, Wintergrasp, and Arena PvP game play to ensure that fights last a reasonable amount of time without overtly skewing the effectiveness of any class, role, or team combination.<br />

And guys, you know a movie can be epic right without swords clinging everywhere, having a woman hold her dying love in her hands yelling &quot;I LOVE YOU!!!!!!&quot; and the fallen having a five minute long speech before he dies?<br />
<br />
I think this movie fits perfectly with the intro and the 3.3 trailer, who was the main character there apart from the LK? That's right, his father, not Tirion or anybody else, only logical his father would be there when his son died as well.</div></div><hr />

Delighted at this decision Ner'zhul states &quot;We are one, Arthas. Together we are the Lich King. No more Ner'zhul, no more Arthas -- only this one glorious being.&quot; With that Arthas murders Ner'zhul and tells him &quot;No we. No one tells me what to do. I've got everything I need from you -- now the power is mine and mine alone. Now there is only I. I am the Lich King. And I am ready.&quot; Ner'zhul is stunned by the betrayal, then disappears. It is uncertain if this dream state actually results in Arthas murdering Ner'zhul's essence, but it would seem to indicate that Arthas's soul lords over Ner'zhul's.'<br />
as quoted from wowwiki.com<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure this explains why the Lich King (Arthas) just dies. Ner'zhul isn't there to control the body anymore. If he's still there, he was fused with Arthas so if you damage one, you damage the other. <br />
<br />
So, with that out of the way.<br />
Personally, I thought the cinematic was okay but I didn't have high expectations for this kind of thing. It's hard to end a classic, drawn-out bad guy vs. good guys story (heard of a certain book called Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows?) because it's difficult to not make the end anti-climatic.</div></div><hr />

My best guess is that he's going to remain dormant and server as a depressant for all the scourge lol. Probably he's containing his power just to serve as the &quot;jailer&quot;. He may also be dying and i guess that would preserve his body more? Not sure. One things for sure, he resembles Ner'Zhul how he was encased in ice. Either way, i think the whole idea is stupid. There's no reason for blizz to keep the lich king. They keep saying oh, they will tear azeroth apart...but wasn't the lich kings agenda to do so? Whats more dangerous? An organized army with plans? Or a scattered army with no direction or purpose. The powers of the lich king should of gone with arthas death. And let bolvar rest in piece. Makes no sense to me whatsoever. Its like they desperately trying to do a parody of Pirates of the Carri-bean. The the dutchman must always have a captain lol. Common.</div></div><hr />

There are very many &quot;mythologys&quot; that have some form or other of &quot;jailer/ruler of the dead&quot; even if it's just of a certain portion of the dead. in fact I would be hard pressed to think of one that doesn't. It is however possible some exist I never claimed to know everything about every belief system.</div></div><hr />

That's __7__ years to see the fate of Arthas and the conclusions of his acts.. and what do we get?<br />

a ~3 min long cutscene with a few frases and then some random guy (Yes I know that Bolvar was close to Wrynn and ruled in his absent, still not a MAJOR char in wc3 universe.) to take his place.<br />

Its a clear statement that Blizzard doesnt give a shit.. Its all about promoting the game before and when ppl have it they can just throw about whatever they want.<br />

I highly doubt that. I'm pretty sure they planned for that all expansion. The incident at the Wrath Gate, Alexstraza's words just after, the visions during Yog, these all involved Bolvar in one way or another. It's not something they came up with at the last minute.</div></div><hr />

That is JUST the cinematic. You have all the ingame stuff as well. Bolvar has been around since the start of WoW and had a major part in WOLTK. Remember the whole Wrathgate stuff?</div></div><hr />

Though I see your point, you're missing mine, Im not saying he is a &quot;last minute&quot; solution.. just the easiest one and a very lame one. <br />
And the fact that he actually dies and somehow returns in Lavaform just makes me rofl.<br />

And for the post above me, dont try to be a wiseguy dude..<br />
&quot;Have you seen the whole Wrathgate stuff?&quot;.. of course I have.<br />
It still doesnt really make me feel that Bolvar is major character in Warcraft lore.<br />
His role has been to stand beside a child in Stormwind while Wrynn was absent, to later lead an assault on Wrathgate - Do you really think that justifices him being the new Lich King?<br />
<br />
Tirion, Mal'Ganis, Ner'Zhul or just someone more &quot;major&quot; wouldve been accepted imo.<br />
Bolvar? no...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's clear!<br />
This is just the start of Bolvar, but at the cost of Arthas? No thank you.<br />
People (including me obviously) have been waiting for this for 7 years, and we get 3 minutes of nothing..<br />
This was the cinematic that would show the fate of Arthas and the Lich King.<br />
And with the fact that Arthas might be the biggest char in Warcraft - with Thrall, Jaina, Sargeras etc - he should've been given a grand exit. Not just a few phares and then to see Bolvar come in and mantle the Frozen Throne.<br />
<br />
This cinematic was epic until Arthas father arrived, from there it went downhill..<br />
It was suppose to be the BIG conclusion and finale to Arthas, what we have been waiting for, for so long.<br />
And we got shit.. just as when Illidan died.. it feel thin and just lazy.. A story with no heart<br />
The ending should be something you remember the movie for, something that reflects what has been before it.<br />
And this just makes Arthas and all the lore around him and the Lich King look like meaningless shit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-02-02, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One idea that a few people seem to be missing: Blizzard knows any movie they put into the game is going to be datamined before the Lich King is killed on live servers. My guess is that most of the ending story is going to be told using in-game characters and only spread by boss-kill videos and such. There was a lot of information given in the video about the end of the fight but I seriously doubt that's all we're going to get for the end of WotLK.<br />
<br />
If this is all we get then Blizzard have seriously lost their way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard knew Bolvar was going to be the Lich King when this expac was in the planning stages... When you hand in the quest after the wrathgate Alexstrasza tells you the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;Our fate is emblazoned upon our souls at birth. Bolvar's fall, while tragic, was unavoidable.<br />
<br />
All that you can do now is honor your hero, &lt;name&gt;. Collect Bolvar's shield from the field of battle and return it to your king. When you present the shield to Varian, tell him this: &quot;All is not lost. From the ashes of the fallen will rise a force that will unite nations and purge the evil from this world.&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
The being who has risen from the ashes, quite literally from the dragon's fire, is Bolvar AKA Lavaman AKA the Lich King V2. This entire expac has been a hymn to fallen heroes, with Arthas being the most obvious example. You complained about this being a lame culmination to the story of Arthas &quot;we only get a 3 minute cutscene&quot;- what did we get when Illidan, arguably as pivotal a character as Arthas, was defeated? Or Kil'Jaeden for that matter? This is the perfect epilogue to Arthas's story- the fallen hero vanquished, his place taken by the most noble of sacrifices. Arrogance replaced by selflessness, cruelty by sacrifice, dishonour by honour. It's everything that the greatest high fantasy literature embodies, and you'd rather instead that Mal'Ganis popped up and shouted 'Onslaught Harbour was merely a setback, I IZ TEH NEW LITCH KING!'?<br />
<br />
Seriously, try and develop a sense of the dramatic- this cutscene is awesome...</div></div><hr />

Ok sure, I get the reason in the game - that the Scourge will be free to cause chaos - but wasn't it the Lich King who raised the dead, created and controlled the plague and who mentally linked the undead to himself. So if he dies and isnt replaced the link is shattered and they are free. But with no one to raise more undead and no one to continue the power that fed the plague wouldnt we eventually run out of undead and be free of them?</div></div><hr />

/facepalm tords you.<br />
<br />
Such a childish way to end otherwise a good argument.<br />
Mal'Ganis could steal the helm, its not far fetched.<br />
Though I dont see it as likely and the fact that i mentioned him was cause he's a big char from the same era as Arthas.<br />

<br />
The Lich King conclusion was not 3 minutes. The Lich King conclusion was called Wrath of the Lich King. 4 conclusive pieces of content directed towards the Lich King mainly. 3.0 was the invasion of Northrend to take the fight to Arthas, as well as the takedown of the stronghold necropolis known as Naxxramas, which also had raids towards OS and the takedown of Malygos. 3.1 was mainly about Yogg-saron in Ulduar, but it was also the beginning of the Argent Tournament, which was finished in 3.2. The Argent trials were all created to prepare for the final assault of the Lich King's fortress, Icecrown Citadel, which held his most powerful agents of the Scourge.<br />
So that's 4 patches of nothing but preparations to take down the Lich King...and that's over a year's worth of content. That is not 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
Just because the final cutscene may have been lukewarm to you than &quot;HOT HOT HOT&quot;, that still does not mean the Lich King was not given a proper send off. And adding Bolvar as the new Lich King was not a last second deal. Was it easy? Well, sure, but if you're going to start talking about how stories could've been made harder, then why not say that Voldemort was defeated not by Harry Potter, but by Ron? Or that at the end of Star Wars, Han Solo should've been able to shoot Vader and Palpatine in the face at once?<br />

Not to mention how you're saying that Tirion could've been the new Lich King when he was once only a side character in a questline in EPL. Bolvar used to be a substitute king. Besides, Tirion has much more potential in him after this. [I love his good nature, oddly enough.]</div></div><hr />

Not just a few phares and then to see Bolvar come in and mantle the Frozen Throne.<br />
<br />
This cinematic was epic until Arthas father arrived, from there it went downhill..<br />
It was suppose to be the BIG conclusion and finale to Arthas, what we have been waiting for, for so long.<br />
And we got shit.. just as when Illidan died.. it feel thin and just lazy.. A story with no heart<br />
The ending should be something you remember the movie for, something that reflects what has been before it.<br />
And this just makes Arthas and all the lore around him and the Lich King look like meaningless shit.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know, in the grand scheme of Warcraft, Arthas and the Lich King are little more than meaningless shit. For the Warcraft 3 fanatics they may seem like the end all be all to all that is Warcraft, but the lore is so much deeper.</div></div><hr />

[SPOILER]<br />
<br />
It is implied after Arthas took the helmet and claimed the title of the Lich King for himself, he sat on the throne and hibernated. I'm pretty sure Bolvar has to do the same thing.<br />
<br />
Why? well, i don't know, maybe being able to communicate to every undead scourge unit telepathically is a little too much to handle on your first day.</div></div><hr />

Without a leader you getting fighting between each other, and disorganization, and then before you know it the scourge are nothing more than another Sporregar-esque faction, selling zombie-chow and bone-encrusted blue quality armor.</div></div><hr />

Bolvar will lose his sanity to the Lich King sooner or later. It's impossible to resist the call forever. I find it funny that the Lich King tells everyone Bolvar will be his new champion and who do we let become the New Lich King? Bolvar. Arthas wasn't &quot;evil&quot; but he was corrupted and turned into a Death Knight and became such... I know it's been said that Arthas was the dominant force in the Lich King. We know that Ner'zhul souls is within the Helm of Domination so his voice will be corrupting Bolvar as Frostmourne did to Arthas.<br />
<br />
My one thought though.. This was all pre-planned by Ner'zhul. He knew he needed a new body and he got one. My only real question is.. did Arthas's soul also infuse itself into the Helm of Domination? If it did than Bolvar will just be another part of the struggle.</div></div><hr />

I know that Blizard can make the lore flow any way that they want to, but its fun to try and fill the holes and theorize.<br />
<br />
I just don't see how the Forsaken breaking away would be any different from the rest of the Scourge breaking away.</div></div><hr />

Well I know it makes no sense. Though the scourge is one of the most popular villain factions in Warcraft so I'm assuming they didn't want to get rid of it even with the death of Arthas.</div></div><hr />

Again, the conclusion of Arthas' story is not those 3 sentences, but every single event leading up to those sentences in Wrath.<br />
<br />
For God's sake, you're talking like he should have a 30 minute long speech declaring that their death is just the beginning of the end or will rise again in three days to Waterwalk into the sunset with Thrall, Bolvar, Saurfang, and Varian as his bro force...sweeping up Jaina, then getting stabbed again by Kael'thas randomly.<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't need to make a huge, hour-long movie just for the final moments of Arthas. We had 4 content patches and lore already showing his final chapter. It's not like they decided &quot;Oooff, he's dead now. Collect epix and wait a week for the next try.&quot; They really did put effort into this story.<br />
<br />
Know Arthas for his life, his battles, his turn to darkness, his truly final battle...don't remember him just for how he died in the end. <br />
<br />
We haven't even seen his final battle yet. That's what you want to see before you make judgments on whether or not Blizzard did well with the end of Arthas. It's like saying &quot;This man destroyed all life, did so many epic feats, and was a true hero, but then...and then he died.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arthas would have been equally as 100% meaningless to Horde players when he took the crown. The Lich King players are all Alliance based since Ner'zhul took a back seat (and I don't think the Horde knew he was there anyway). The Horde probably wouldn't even be concerned with them at all if it weren't for the fact that the entire world was in danger and the Forsaken wanted a piece of him.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falcio</div><div class="date">2010-02-02, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PS: 7 years and some alliance paladin who sits in stormwind all day becoming the new lich king is basically 100% meaningless to horde players who saw him for 30 seconds in a previous cut scene. Complete nonsense. <br />
He seemed pretty important to Saurfang if he wanted to save him, after all.<br />
<br />
And what Saurfang wants, Saurfang gets. And because Saurfang is Horde, Bolvar is therefore meaningful TO the Horde.<br />
<br />
You could bring so many cases against every single other possible choice. Tirion? He was just a quest giver in EPL from 1-70, then suddenly became the leader of the Argent Crusade against Arthas. If Mal'ganis got the power of the Lich King, it would accomplish nothing...not to mention he'd probably just destroy the entity entirely, thus causing the Scourge to completely destroy Azeroth.<br />
<br />
A character only becomes meaningful when the story makes him meaningful. Blizzard could take a random Gnome from Ironforge and make him the most powerful Gnome in the world, and able to completely restore Gnomeregan AND make them a military force to be reckoned with and I'd completely buy it. As long as they made the story believable, however. The story of Bolvar becoming the Lich King is completely believable to me.<br />
<br />
Is it what everyone wanted? Doy, no...otherwise, everyone would be praising the movie. It's simply what Blizzard wanted to do with the story. You like it or you don't...you're still obviously interested enough to worry about it, so at least Blizzard knows you care about the story.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-02-02, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with this video (I can't bring myself to call it a cinematic) is that the emphasis isn't on Arthas, it's on Bolvar. We (the people who played Warcraft III) followed Arthas as he slowly became more and more damned, watched him become a Death Knight and lead the scourge all the way to Ice Crown. <br />
When we all got to Northrend we kept encountering either Arthas (The Lich King) or his handywork, and he was ever present in all our minds. &quot;Eventually, we're gonna kill Arthas!&quot;.<br />
What do we get? &quot;There must always be a Lich King.&quot; Enter V2.0...<br />
In TBC we killed Kael'thas, Vashj and Illidan. 3 very big characters relative to the lore of Warcraft 3. In this expansion we killed Arthas only to have him immediately replaced.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ginsuchop</div><div class="date">2010-02-02, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">6/10 on the cinematic. I wasn't expecting a 10, but it was underwhelming.<br />
<br />
So the official reasoning is that without a LK to keep the Scourge in check, they would overrun Azeroth.<br />
If the Scourge is/was strong enough to conquer Azeroth, why didn't the LK do it years ago? I presume world domination/the-living-are-no-more was his goal. I guess he was just waiting for us to slog through vanilla and TBC so we could kick his butt at level 80.<br />
<br />
And now that Bolvar is the new LK, why doesn't he simply command all his minions to tear each other up or find some other means of self-destruction? Once the Scourge implodes, destroy the helmet and you're done. Even Tirion/Bolvar can't be dumb enough to believe that their solution is anything but a bandaid fix. Sooner or later the new LK will lose his senses and start some new trouble.<br />
<br />
All this conclusion does is use shoddy reasoning to setup a WOTLK2 xpack down the line. I don't mind the idea of a new Lich King, in of itself. I do mind that Blizzard spent all this effort and press to hype WOTLK as some grand story arc and promised an epic conclusion, but all we get is a poorly written ending that suggests for all Alli/Horde's hard work, the LK is still kickin', it was all a waste, and the heroes will have to come back and do 2x time the work to mop up Tirion/Bolvar's idiocy. It seems these characters are only interested in making grand/melodramatic/heroic gestures/sacrifices rather than implementing real solutions.What amateurish, circular storywriting.</div></div><hr />

He has fires inside him. He has been burned by a freaking group of red dragons. <br />
He has black skin. He survived the fucking flame, what color should he be? Pink?<br />
Lore-wise, nobody knows the Cataclysm will happen. If WoW characters do, like we do, know that the Cataclysm will happen, don't you think they would go to Gim Batol and f*ck Deathwing's brains out while he is still weak?<br />
Conclusion: Stop linking Bolvar to Cataclysm and Deathwing!</div></div><hr />

We kil...ahem...banish Kil'Jaedan, and get a nice little epilogue. We take out the Lich King, and they give us a pretty damn fitting cinematic. Yeah, it's not all that detailed and &quot;omg pyro and parties and lewtz lololololol&quot; It doesn't NEED to be. I think it is perfect. The Lich King dies, and in his final moments, we get Arthas. He knows everything he has done, doesn't ask for forgiveness which he knows he does not deserve, and he accepts his fate. Only asking if it's all over now. And Terenas, being a father, still loves, and forgives his son. Then Tirion, unaware of Bolvar sitting on the throne, is willing to sacrifice himself to ensure the scourge is controlled. Bolvar knows that he is not who he used to be, is willing to be the grand sacrifice by a noble soul. Tirion doesn't want his good friend and brother in arms to have to do that. Bolvar however, wants Tirion to live out the rest of his life however it plays out. Tirion knows this, and Bolvar, is crowned, so to speak, and freezes himself and presumably the rest of the scourge. As for leave now and never return? Who can blame him for saying that? He is no longer Bolvar, he is the Lich King now, albeit a (for now possibly) good one. <br />
<br />
<br />
I like this comment. It's right on. I would have like one minor change though.<br />
<br />
*Arthas dies, his spirit rises from his body, Terenas takes his son's hand.<br />
Terenas: Come my son, you have a long road ahead of you...'<br />
*They both walk off and vanish*<br />
(The whole New lich king crap, wich is lame, was already mentioned by Uther so we can leave that part out.)<br />
Indeed, more DV stuff but I like the tough of Arthas not just dying like that. He was THE reason I loved WCIII and started playing WoW.</div></div><hr />
