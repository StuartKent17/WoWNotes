Comments in news posts went slightly out of control lately so I think it's time to clarify a few things!<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Beta<br />
At this point I'm pretty sure I will end up being wrong about the Cataclysm Beta Starting in April (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/cataclysm-testing-in-april-blue-posts/). I could either hide the news post and ban anyone mentioning it on the forums for the next 2 years or laugh at it, I decided to laugh.<br />
<br />
Now just to make it clear, when I posted this information it was pretty clear that the Alpha test would start in April but apparently a couple of things went terribly wrong and it was postponed a couple of times. The information itself wasn't bad, I just learned the hard way that you do not try to predict the beginning of a Blizzard's Alpha in public. <br />
<br />
Patch 3.3.5<br />
Yesterday's post made a lot of people wonder if the beta was starting or not, at this point it's not really clear if the PTR copies were tested for the beta or for 3.3.5 but considering that Blizzard employees didn't hear about F&amp;F/Beta keys I suggest that you assume it is Patch 3.3.5 until proved otherwise. <br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
The PTR/Beta release dates aren't set in stone and it's very hard to get any reliable information about that for the moment. Also, I do realize that people will take that opportunity to jump at my throat screaming &quot;YOU WERE WRONNNNNG!&quot; but I also hope that a few people out there know how things work and understand that patches/alpha predictions are a tricky thing, I'm still 100% confident about everything I post/posted/will post on the front page and if I think something is relevant and safe enough to be there, it will be pretty hard to make me change my mind. <br />
<br />
For those of you who really want to try to kill me in public, here is a very cute picture of Garfield to cheer you up before you hit the reply button!<br />

Inappropriate Character and Team Names<br />
To ensure all participants in the Arena Tournament have the best experience possible, there will be a zero-tolerance policy for any inappropriate character or Arena team names created on the Arena Tournament realm.<br />
<br />
Characters with inappropriate names will be deleted. This means that you will need to customize another template from scratch and re-earn all personal and hidden ratings. Keep in mind that in a later phase of the Arena Tournament team rosters will be locked down. If your character is deleted during this time, no exceptions will be made and your team will need to use whoever is left on that roster in order to continue competing.<br />
<br />
Arena teams with names deemed inappropriate will be dissolved. This means that you will need to create another charter for your team and climb back up from a rating of zero.<br />
<br />
Please think twice before naming your characters and Arena teams! <br />

Blue posts<br />
Buff Homogenization<br />
We really don't want the buffs and debuffs you bring to be the reason you get a spot in the raid. We hate the thought of kicking a good player for a bad player because the latter provides so much of a dps increase to everyone else. We hate the thought of not being able to raid with your friends because playing raid buff Tetris is more important to your success.<br />
<br />
Raid buffs and debuffs exist for two main reasons:<br />
<br />
1) They encourage you to bring a diversity of classes and specs rather than stacking whatever is highest dps at the moment.<br />
2) They make you feel more powerful in a group than when you're solo. For an MMO, WoW is pretty soloable, so we like for it to feel really awesome when you're in a group.<br />
<br />
Whenever we read &quot;Without my buff, there is no reason for a group to take me,&quot; our typical response is: awesome. You'll have to figure out another reason why they should take you. Whenever we read that a particular buff is the driving decisions behind why you took one player over another, then we know we still have some work to do.<br />
<br />
There will be more buff / debuff consolidation in Cataclysm. I look forward to the day when the raid buff everyone brings dominates less of the forum discussion. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401906297/shared-raid-lockouts-more-homogenized-buffs/))<br />
<br />
Personal Rating removal on PvP Weapons in Cataclysm<br />
This is the kind of thing that we're likely to iterate on a lot before Cataclysm and the new PvP season go live, but it will probably be something like those PvP weapons the same ilevel as raid weapons will require no rating but a lot of Conquest points, while those PvP weapons the same ilevel as the HEROIC raid weapons will require a rating of some kind.<br />
<br />
We want everyone who is interested in PvP to have a reasonable shot of getting decent gear so they can actually compete. We also want to still offer rewards to those players who are the best of the best at PvP. We don't want everyone just dying their way to the most powerful weapons in the game.<br />
<br />
When we've settled on and are ready to talk about ilevels, then it will be easier to have a discussion about actual numbers and not just goals. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401857206/no-pr-on-pvp-gear-easy-hard-mode-weps/))<br />

Spamming Wild Growth<br />
I addressed this with my first post in this thread (I think). We could just make the mana cost so high that it's prohibitive to spam. What could very well happen though is healers spam it anyway, run out of mana, and then say there's no way for them to heal without using the spell and that the mana cost is just too high. You can argue that's still the right answer anyway. I concede that that might be the way we go.<br />
<br />
In the case of say Flash Heal vs. Heal, there's a pretty clear alternative. There isn't a clear alternative to Wild Growth other than just tab targeting Rejuv on several different people. Nor are we crazy about giving druids yet another heal to be the fast, inefficient AE so WG can be the efficient AE. We think it's better just to design an environment in which you don't need to AE heal as often and get a chance to use your other heals in the meantime.<br />
<br />
To those players who say they don't want to cast a lot of different spells, I'm a little perplexed as to what you thought you were getting into with the Resto druid. Surely you thought there would come a day when we'd try to make those other spells attractive again or else cut them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401904223/there-goes-wild-growth/))<br />

Hunter rotations<br />
Yeah, I would describe the Feral &quot;rotation&quot; as more of a prioritization. Instead of the player just hitting 123123, they have to make the best decision for their resources at that moment. Feral druids are rarely &quot;starved for resources&quot; unless it's an unusual fight like Vezax. There is almost always a button they can push and the decision is whether to push a cheaper button now or wait a sec or two to push a stronger button.<br />
<br />
That's more of how we see the hunter playing. If hunters don't use about the same number of shot that they do now, then we've failed. What will feel different is that you won't hit long stretches of being out of mana.<br />
<br />
It's definitely possible that the long term cooldown abilities won't cost any focus. You shouldn't have to bank part of your bar for emergencies.<br />
<br />
My apologies if you just really liked mana as a mechanic. For us, and for plenty of hunters -- because they told us constantly -- mana just never fit the hunter class. You're firing arrows, not winding up big spells. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401697657/if-it-is-not-broken-do-not-fix-it/))<br />

Warrior AE Tanking<br />
For me it comes down to whether warriors can AE tank or not. The impression I'm getting from a lot of these posts (though not yours) is a lot of warriors can AE tank okay but just want it to be easier. &quot;Easier&quot; is something you have to be very careful about. If you're making it easier because it's currently frustrating then it might be a good change. If you're making it easier because it's currently challenging, then it might be a bad change. Those aren't easy conditions to untangle though, because for some players any failure to win (or sometimes even a failure to be efficient) is frustrating.<br />
<br />
Regardless, as I said before, given that we don't expect tanks to be doing a lot of AE tanking, we're not sure they need a ton of abilities solely devoted to AE tanking. If warriors truly can't AE tank, then we'd rather make the tools they have work rather than trying to add Whirlwind as yet another button on your tanking bar.<br />
<br />
Given that warriors generally seem to be able to AE tank fine today (and in fact could AE tank fine back in BC when the tools were even less AE-friendly) and given that there will be fewer opportunities to AE tank in the future, any problems in the future will be by definition even smaller in magnitude. Given that, I think the amount of time we've spent on this topic is quite disproportionate to its importance.

<br />
No worries about the inaccurate prediction. It was correct at the time you posted it, and I'm sure we'll be seeing a lot more information about Cataclysm and its Beta soon enough.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this doesn't mean that the expansion gets pushed past Blizzcon, though! :&lt;<br />

It is almost perfectly fine at the moment. Continuous threat is really good and snap aggro is also nice. The only problem is, when Thunderclap and Shockwave are on cooldown and you get new adds mid-fight. The only time i get threat problems on my warrior is, when an equal or better geared dps decides to go full single target on one of the &quot;side&quot;-mobs.</div></div><hr />

Pre-Blizzcon 2009 he announced pretty much spot on Cataclysm information. This for me spoiled Blizzcon. Blizzcon is a huge public event many dollars spent and Boubouille just spoiler half of it.<br />

I compare it to telling everyone Darth Vadar is Luke father before they see the movie type of thing.<br />

Just my personal opinion. Spoilers about what's in beta and content patches etc are pretty cool but I don't know spoilers for major announcements is a bit much.<br />

Pre-Blizzcon 2009 he announced pretty much spot on Cataclysm information. This for me spoiled Blizzcon. Blizzcon is a huge public event many dollars spent and Boubouille just spoiler half of it.<br />
<br />
I compare it to telling everyone Darth Vadar is Luke father before they see the movie type of thing.<br />
<br />
Just my personal opinion. Spoilers about what's in beta and content patches etc are pretty cool but I don't know spoilers for major announcements is a bit much.<br />
<br />
Just my personal opinion hope I don't get banned or something. o.O Please don't :)<br />
<br />

You might like to stop coming to mmo-champion then...<br />
If you are not interested about wow infomarion/spoilers. <br />
All the other things you can get from blue tracker and few bookmarks in your internet browser.<br />
No problemo... Other thing is that Boubouille always tags his spoilers with SPOILER sign.</div></div><hr />

I have to say given how unforgiving some people can be with information that ended up being wrong even though nothing was set in stone in the first place I respect you a lot for addressing it on the front page. I guess the silver lining here is that if they had to delay the expansion a little bit due to issues on the alpha level we'll be getting a more solid product and they might even get a couple of things in sooner than planned because I'm sure the whole team isn't working on that one issue. Also very cute garfield btw. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The general idea is there but there are still buffs that look the same if u check what they do, but upgraded versions still trumph their counterpart by quite a lot. I talk about buffs like Mana Spring Totem/Blessing of Wisdom, Horn of Winter/Strength of the Earth totem, Blood Pact/Commanding Shout (there might be more). They all give the same buff but still not. I do get that blizz have the problem with overwriting and maybe one buff need to have something like 1 statpoint higher value to fix that. The fact is that e.g. Improved Mana Spring Totem is quite alot better then Improved Blessing of Wisdom. Same goes for other buffs. All in all its not a big deal. Just feels like a weird step in development not to make them the same when they kinda should be.</div></div><hr />

There is one way you could redeem yourself though, and its sending a very serious advice to your colleagues at Blizz saying that if there is one single more post about Warrior AE tanking Im going to burn the place to ashes.

I thought the way to get around this was to let crafters be able to craft untalented version of buff eg runescrolls.<br />
That way a classes buffs still feel unique but there are options. Giving similar buffs to multiple classes is just stupid</div></div><hr />

I feel the same, im sick of hearing about it. Paladins have insane AoE tanking, but never once has Blizz ever said a word about how OP they are. And yet every day we see another Warrior AoE tanking post, knowing damn well they arn't as good as the other 3 tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my opinion, there is nothing distinctly difficult about it, if one just makes a little effort to discern which tools should be used for which situation. The only &quot;issue&quot; with warrior tanking seems to be the lack of effort on the side of some warrior players at learning their class thoroughly enough to handle their job. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
The G15 (original v1, blue) is exactly the same as G11 in every way except it has an LCD. Recently they stopped making G15v1s and started making G15v2 (orange) which have less keys. If I recall right, Bibi had a G15 but swapped it for a G11 when it died on him one day while he was hunting wabbits, as it's hard to get G15v1s now.</div></div><hr />

incorrect only the newer models of the g15 have less keys <br />
http://www.hardware.no/tester/input/logitech_g15/g-15hel-stor.jpg <br />
the older ones still have the 18 g keys and look exactly like the g11 except have a screen<br />

For us, and for plenty of hunters -- because they told us constantly -- mana just never fit the hunter class. You're firing arrows, not winding up big spells.<br />
I understand what the deal is with removing the mana, I just don't like the idea of becoming a wannabe rogue/feral druid</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gaexion Ramza Beoulve</div><div class="date">2010-04-29, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">AE tanking has become the focus of WoTLK as Heroic Dungeons and 'can you farm them' has become the game. Since you can't depend on pugs and DPS in general to chill the fuck out you need initial aggro as fast as possible. Because the gear out-scales the dungeons aggro is a problem. Well for Warriors at least.<br />
<br />
A skilled Prot Warrior can succesfully tank anything anywhere anytime. But most are offspec warriors are just trying to get by. Most warriors just need to get their daily done. Most warriors are just helping a friend through a random and they get stuck with HoS or HoR.(ffs every time everyday on every character) Most warriors aren't asking for a handout. And no one wants their class turned into 'baby mode bubble cause it hurts me' class. But they need help and they don't know how to ask for it.<br />
<br />
Well I do.<br />
<br />
Don't turn me into a Paladin, but put me on par. Many protection talents are exactly the same but there are a few warrior talents that are lacking and need to be brought up to speed. The biggest thing is that Paladins have consecrate and the holy shield ability. The warrior only has Shield Block and Damage Shield. What I would propose is something that allows them to generate a big burst of rage up front for those times when the warrior has run out rage and is trying to pick up an add and suddenly is forced to deal with a huge incoming group of adds he was not ready for. The disparity between the two concepts is that if the Paladin is caught off-guard he has a reliable source of mana, several snap aggro moves with short cooldowns and a very steady AE aggro generation.<br />
<br />
So what the warrior needs is an ability that is based off his damage shield. An ability that makes him take an increased amount of damage and will encourage mobs to attack HIM so that he can do three things:<br />
<br />
1. Have a reliable source of rage to tap into when the shit hits the fan.<br />
2. Generate enough initial aggro so that he can babysit event he most retarded DPS<br />
3. Maintain a unique playstyle from Paladins or Deathknights.<br />
<br />
How about an AE mocking blow that increases the Damage dealt to him while forcing the mob to attack him until the mobs have dealt a certain amount of damage or until the warrior reaches a certain amount of health. Give it a 3m cooldown and call it something rage worthy. But whatever happens i don't want to see warriors get something like &quot;Rain of Caltrops&quot; or &quot;Revenger's Shield&quot;. I think everyone just wants Blizz to admit that the environment has become hostile to that class and their inaccessibility to players of different skill levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I think there should be a talent added in the deep prot tree that adds a dot effect to everyone applied with TC which ticks for 3 seconds, each second does 50% damage of your TC initially, then 50% damage of the previous tick, so your TC hits for 1000, then the dot ticks for 500, then 250, then 125 with damage done by this dot scaling in threat the same way TC does, that would be my personal solution to making TC feel more on the same level as DnD and Conc, without making it feel like a cloned AE tanking ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, who the hell cares if he was wrong? It was an educated guess at the time, and he said it was. Educated guess implies that with his sources and knowledge and experience he made an estimation. If the Estimation was off because of some internal stuff at Blizzard that just means that they WERE ready, but unfortunate circumstances delayed what they were ready for.<br />
<br />
Just like anything in a business - you have to be prepared for delays and deal with them as they come. It's NOT Highschool, where everything has to be delivered within your semester. In the real world, things get delayed. <br />

Another post about Warrior AE tankin, srsly, enough is enough... :/<br />
<br />
<br />
This. Seriously. I'm absolutely tired of hearing the same rib-rab over and over again. <br />
<br />
For warriors who cant AE Tank -- Not only do I have little respect for your whining, but it <br />
essentially is a moot point, since there will be very little aoe tanking in cata anyway. So, <br />
how do I say this lightly?<br />
<br />
Grow up.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though Boub, your predictions are right on the money 99.99% of the time, you HAD to be wrong at one point - plus, who knows if you HAVE been wrong this time, you said it yourself, at the time it seemed like it would be April but something went wrong.<br />

We might offer a few items to the absolute best players based on personal rating, largely as cosmetic or 'bragging rights' type items.<br />
<br />
Good. Because...<br />
<br />
The current system has a touch of the rich-get-richer syndrome where players who lack the ratings can’t get the most competitive gear and feel like they have no hope of competing. Better players will still gear up much more quickly because they will have more points to spend. <br />
<br />
... and PvP should be all about player skill and the rock/paper/scissors dynamic of classes and compositions.<br />
<br />
... while those PvP weapons the same ilevel as the HEROIC raid weapons will require a rating of some kind.<br />
<br />
... Wait, what?<br />

Whenever we read &quot;Without my buff, there is no reason for a group to take me,&quot; our typical response is: awesome. You'll have to figure out another reason why they should take you.<br />

Oh... ok. Well, that's good too.<br />

Comments in news posts went slightly out of control lately so I think it's time to clarify a few things!<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Beta<br />
...The information itself wasn't bad, I just learned the hard way that you do not try to predict the beginning of a Blizzard's Alpha in public. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
The PTR/Beta release dates aren't set in stone and it's very hard to get any reliable information about that for the moment.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've found Boub's forecasts to be the most accurate non-official source around. Who else predicted worgens and goblins months in advance of the official word?<br />
<br />
Makes me wonder what happened though. It's pretty evident at this point Alpha's a hush-hush type of deal.</div></div><hr />
