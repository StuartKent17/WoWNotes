<br />
This post will be updated in a few minutes<br />
<br />
Lake Wintergrasp<br />
PvE elements are being added to this PvP Zone, for example the equivalent of Elemental Plateau in Outland is in Lake Wintergrasp.<br />
Siege Combat will be in both Lake Wintergrasp and the new Battleground (see below)<br />
Siege vehicles incude air combat with flying vehicles. <br />
You can destroy the buildings within Lake Wintergrasp and in the Battleground.<br />
Lake Wintergrasp will feature an attack/defend game type. Just like the Auchindoun Spirit Towers, when your faction holds a tower it will keep it for a certain amount of time and retain all the advantage for a few hours. <br />
Northrend &quot;Spirit Shards&quot; will be used to reward players. When your faction controls Lake Wintergrasp all the bosses in Northrend will start dropping them. You can then use these shards to buy rewards from a merchant, they won't be more powerful any other reward but just an alternative to other sources of equipement (like gearing up for PvP very quickly).<br />
&quot;Wintergrasp Marks of Honor&quot; will drop as well and will be redeemable for items through the honor system and other NPCs. <br />
Bridges will be used as &quot;choke point&quot; in the map, siege vehicles can't travel through water. <br />
The goal of Lake Wintergrasp is to capture the &quot;Wintergrasp Keep&quot;, everything in that keep is destructable and you will have to break into the keep to capture the point.<br />
Players will be able to control stationnary cannons on each tower to defend the keep. <br />
Bridges are very large and very tall, players should be able to see them from anywhere in the map. They're also totally destructable as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Siege Vehicles<br />
The Demolisher<br />
The Demolisher has both short and long range attacks<br />
It is meant to bombard players and buildings from a long distance, it's also equipped with a ram to siege buildings. <br />
It can hold up to 3 passengers, passengers are exposed and can be targeted individually. However, players can cast while the vehicle is moving if they're in it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Forsaken Catapult<br />
The catapult is faster than the demolisher but its range is slightly lower.<br />
It does slightly less damage.<br />
It cannot hold any pessenger. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Siege Engine<br />
This is the siege weapon with the longest range.<br />
The gunner is sitting in the turrent and has full control of the turret. <br />
The driver is only moving the vehicle. <br />
The passengers in this vehicle are fully protected but can't shoot other enemies. <br />
It's also got a very powerful ramming attack<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Flying machine<br />
Flying Machines can bomb enemies, they're swift but very vulnerable to anti-air attacks. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Goblin Shredder<br />
The shredder is an anti-air vehicle.<br />
It will use anti-air rockets, they're long range homing missiles.<br />
This is a personal armor suit, if the vehicle is destroyed the player just jumps out and keep fighting on his own.<br />
You can use your sawblade as close range melee attacks.<br />
The shredder can jump into the air just like rocket boots for players. This can also be used to jump over walls.<br />
The shredder is very vulnerable to siege damage. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Arenas<br />
The point is to keep arenas simple, while leaving room to innovate. <br />
Stream lost at this point, will update later.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dalaran Arena<br />
The arena is fairly small and mounts won't be allowed here. <br />
Arenas will introduce new &quot;movable&quot; objects, changing the line of sight of the battlefield every few seconds in the arena. For instance pillars might go up and down randomly, on a timer, etc ... <br />
There is a pipe coming from the ceilling, every once in a while a column of water will start dropping from this pipe.<br />
Each team will start in a pipe on one side of the map, as the match begins a column of water will &quot;push&quot; the teams out of their pipes to prevent camping.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Orgrimmar Arena<br />
There might have objects dealing damage to players, pillars moving up and down based on a timer. There will be visual signs on the battleground to warn players before something happens.<br />
Triggered objects will deal damage to players, for example when the pillars go down spikes will come up. <br />
Teams will be very close to each other at the beginning of the match. Players will start in elevators rising from the ground and will start 10 yards away from the enemy team. <br />
Mounts will be allowed in this arena.<br />
If you stay on a pillar when it rises up you go up with it. <br />
There will be spikes around the elevators, they will go down a few seconds after you reached the fighting area to let you the time to check what classes you're facing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Northrend Battleground<br />
This battleground is located on an island south of Dragonblight<br />
This is also an attack/defend game type battleground. <br />
One team will attack and the other one defend, you will have a specific amount of time to succeed. After the end of the round teams will switch sides. <br />
Attackers will come from boats and defenders will start in the middle of the beach. <br />
There are 3 sections of walls in the Area, after each wall there are capture points and graveyards to make the attack on the next points faster. <br />
Attackers will get more siege vehicles depending on their progression throughout the siege.<br />
The battleground will be either 10vs10 or 15vs15, this isn't decided yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A<br />
The battleground reporting system is being tuned to let player police themselves easier. <br />
A spectator mode is planned, but devs keep in mind that some players won't want to have other players spectacting them. <br />
Everything is done to make outdoor PvP more pleasant and prevent server crashes. All objectives in Wintergrasp are all spaced appart to prevent players from gathering at the same point, that's also why there are a lot of rivers in the zone. <br />
There isn't any plan to add racial abilities to each race. <br />
PvP rewards won't be changed, you will still be able to get some of the best item for some slots from the honor system, and the 5-part set from the Arenas. <br />
Battlegrounds starting without even teams is definitely a problem. Some changes will be made to the queue system to prevent the overlapping between the queues of each battleground and make sure that matches start with the same amount of players on each side.<br />

<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
There will be 8 Level Up dungeons and 4 Max Level Dungeons.<br />
There will be a 10/25 players mode for each raid dungeon. <br />
Heroic dungeons will be made slightly easier, at least devs are going to make sure you don't necessarily need a specific class like a prot warrior to complete it. <br />
Some dungeons were too long in Burning Crusade and completing a dungeon shouldn't take more than an hour. <br />
Quests didn't feel as connected as they should and dungeons quest should implicate a bit more in the background of the instance. Killing bosses might even have an impact on the world. <br />
Gun'drak will be a level 80 Dungeon and the last objective of a huge questline going through the whole zone (Zul'Drak). <br />
Black Temple and Hyjal Summit were released too early, on a second thought it would probably have been better to release Zul'aman first instead of postponing it for more than a year. Developpers are going to make sure that Arthas is and feels like the final boss of Wrath of the Lich King. <br />
Attunements to enter Heroic instances will be removed. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Reputation<br />
You will be able to earn reputation toward a specific faction by becoming its &quot;champion&quot;, for example by wearing a Cenarion Circle tabard while running Hellfire Ramparts you will earn reputation for both Honor Hold/Thrallmar and Cenarion Circle. Obviously tabards reputation requirements will be changed to something like friendly/honored.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Itemization<br />
More PvP gear will be delivered through the PvE system, it won't be the best gear but it will give you a chance to get started.<br />
More PvP gear will be added as reputation rewards. <br />
More items will drop from 25-man dungeons.<br />
Items will be changed by removing &quot;unecessary&quot; stats to make them usable by more classes at the same time. <br />
More recipes and plans will be added to the game, with a better representation between professions. Even if some recipes will still drop from a specific boss in a dungeon like in BC, devs will try to make some of them easier to obtain. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knights<br />
Death Knights will be able to tank 5-man, heroics, raids dungeons, but in a &quot;different&quot; way. It will also fill a few more roles and won't be here just to tank. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Oculus (LVL 80 Dungeon - Borean Tundra) <br />
The dungeon will allow players to use flying mounts, parts of the dungeon will allow you to get a drake and combat while mounted by using different abilities of each drake. Some drakes will be able to tank, some will heal, others will DPS. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Halls of Stone (LVL 77-79 - Storm Peaks)<br />
Halls of Stone will be located in Ulduar in Storm Peaks. <br />
All the dungeons in Ulduar were built by Titans and will really feel huge, however devs didn't want players to need a mount or anything like that to go through it and tried to keep it small. <br />
The storyline of Uldaman will continue in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Caverns of Time: Stratholme (LVL 80 - Tanaris)<br />
The faction requirement on the Caverns of Time teleport will be removed. <br />
The dungeon is fully scripted just like Old Hillsbrad. There are a couple of timed encounters, it will be non-linear and you will be able to choose your encounters. <br />
Players will be fighting alongside Prince Arthas before he falls to the Lich King. <br />
The same voice acting as Warcraft 3 will be used in the instance. (Jaina / Arthas / Uthar)<br />
The Infinite Dragonflight storyline will continue here. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A<br />
Whenever it's possible, devs would prefer to deliver legendary items through quests like Atiesh instead of having them just drop from Bosses.<br />
There won't be any attunement for heroic or entry level raid instances. The remaining attunements will be very simple to understand. <br />
&quot;Wipe management&quot; is a very important part of the design and developpers are doing their best to make sure that corpse run in dungeons aren't too long. <br />
Titles might be added for kills, entering a specific area, etc ... <br />
More tokens will drop to minimize the impact of randomization, sometimes increasing the amount of items dropping from a boss isn't enough. <br />
Dungeons aren't going to be overall easier, but will be more accessible. Bosses might not be easier to kill but will be easier to understand for new players.</div></div><hr />

From what I remember reading a while back, Blizz wants 25-man rewards to be a step above 10-man rewards and while you could progress all the way to Arthas through 10-mans, to get the best stuff you'll need to run 25-mans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OH. HELL. YES.<br />
I pray to &lt;insert name of deity you believe in here, pick random if ateist&gt; that they do actually make these Champion tabards available for ALL reputation factions, even Vanilla and TBC factions. I'm a reputation junkie but I just can't make myself go back to the old world and doing stuff that gives me no benefit beyond reputation with a certain faction.<br />
Plus, I'm currently addicted to my Ret Pally, which not only further takes away the ability to grind rep, but gives me another character to grind rep with.<br />
<br />
If anybody is there and has ability to ask questions, could they please ask the devs if they have plans for creating tabards for all factions?</div></div><hr />

The idea ofc is that heroics are more accessable, so in blizz's minds its 12 at 80. they expect heroics to be jumped into right after 80</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hardly, with more 10 player instances available people will be more willing to switch over to them.<br />
Right now your avarage player does a couple 5 mans a week and maybe 1 kz if they are lucky, with more people willing to do 10mans it will be easier to find pugs for those instances.<br />
<br />
And as said, every dungeon will still have an heroic version so the 5man lovers still have plenty of stuff to play with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons aren't going to be overall easier, but will be more accessible. Bosses might not be easier to kill but will be easier to understand for new players.<br />

This does bother me, sounds as if we are going to have a shitload of dull long fights with maybe 2-3 &quot;special&quot; parts because the majority of wow fails and still cant understand Fire is Bad after 3 years of wow? :&gt;</div></div><hr />

I love WoW, but since i started, i have gotten married and i have a kid as well as a job i love. I do not have time like i did when i was in college and single to invest in WOW. i love the game, i love seeing the content, being able to complete a dungeon in 2 hours or less is a plus. Being able to see ALL the endgame content at the 10 man level is a big plus also.<br />
<br />
so you can say they are dumbing it down, which they are, but i think they are realizing that their players have grown up and have evolved. so they want to make it accessible to EVERYONE, the challenge is still there for you hardcore raiders (of which i used to be a part of) and those of us who dont have time time can still enjoy the game we pay to play. now, i am not saying blizz is doing it perfectly, but they are listening to people and they are making some changes, we shall see how they pan out. <br />

<br />
Predictable in the fact that you know it's going to happen, but if the timers are random rather than in 30 second intervals, it will be random in application and such that your strategy has to be changed on the fly. We don't have alot of information but let me give you a possible scenario.<br />
<br />
Let's assume the spike take say 5-10 seconds to come up and there will be some type of buzzer or the gears are loud or something to signify them rising.<br />
<br />
If the spikes create some type of dynamic LOS and say they stay up for 20 seconds.<br />
<br />
The buzzer goes off and you have 10 seconds to cross the barrier and you see that their healer is behind the pillar ooc and drinking. If you are a rogue you blind your focus, dash to the healer, vanish, sap the healer, SS back to your target and start your rotation. You now have at least 20 seconds of healer LOS and unfortunately that's all you really need as a rogue in their current form,<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
The pillar is down and the spikes are about to come up. 2 seconds until the spikes pop, you blind the healer, vanish, start your rotation on the DPS. Same idea but different application.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly what I was thinking. They can make Lake Wintergrasp the best PvP experience ever, but if there's no real reward (and the Spirit Shards do not count as rewards), then after maybe a week no one will participate anymore. It'll be more useless than Halaa.<br />
<br />
Other than that, they're adding what, 1 new battleground and 2 new Arenas? After a month they'll be old and boring again, and us PvP'ers will have to wait another 2 years for any new PvP content. Arena Seasons are not content, they're filler and time-wasters that mask the reality that Blizzard isn't going to give us anything new.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but if Blizz wants to keep any PvP'ers playing this game after Warhammer comes out, they're going to have to seriously start reconsidering their options. I'd be perfectly happy if they just devote themselves to a PvE game. But don't string players along and try to milk every last dollar out of them by deceiving them for another 2 years.</div></div><hr />

Some dungeons were too long in Burning Crusade and completing a dungeon shouldn't take more than an hour. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
You'd have a really hard time describing anything in TBC as &quot;too long&quot; (except BT...) but apparently the 1 hour 5 minutes some dungeons take (if you wipe a lot...) is now too much.<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah dude, screw you. i get home every night around 8pm. and i'd like to play for an hour or two sometime before 10:30 when i pass out of being tired.</div></div><hr />

My commiserations, clearly I wasn't thinking of people whose entire lives consist of nothing but work, WoW and sleep. How could I have missed those people who have failed so badly at their lives that they work 18 hours a day, play WoW for 2 hours and sleep the remaining 4...<br />
I dread to imagine how you ever find time to post on a web forum, but clearly you have a spare few mins to do so.<br />
<br />
You like short instances, instant gratification, reward for little or no effort? I'm glad for you, there has been an entire WoW expansion aimed at you, an entire new mini-game within WoW created for you and about 5 new games a week churned out from second-rate, corporate driven games developers available for you to play for 5 days before trading them in for next week's editions.<br />
<br />
Shock horror, some people could have different opinions to you; some people may manage their time better than you; some people may look for a more engaging, challenging game experience than you.<br />
<br />
Some people, namely me, were hoping that there would be some &quot;epic&quot; feeling dungeon in the expansion, that would keep you coming back to it again and again, to attack a different part of it each time in short bursts, or to grind through the entire dungeon start to finish and reap the rewards both emotional and tangible from successfully completing such a feat.</div></div><hr />

They're not making a PVP game so whatever they pull out of their ass for content will never be enough for a PVP only player. So 2years is too long, and apparently after 1 month it will get old. So if they invested time to create another BG to introduce mid cycle it still wouldn't be enough for the folks that want to not have anything to do with the PVE game anyway. Losing the player to Warhammer is not a bad thing, I'd consider the player being a fool and playing a game they don't enjoy a nice bonus to the bottom line.</div></div><hr />

You, sir, are a giant douche.<br />
<br />
A majority of the people who play this game have real life commitments, relationships (children, jobs, pets, hobbies) that we enjoy just as much, if not moreso, than WoW. This game has more subscribers who use it as an additional source of entertainment rather than a primary or sole source. <br />
<br />
But to insinuate that one's lack of time management skills is to blame for some not having the time to enjoy the dungeons the way you do, rather than their time limitations stemming from the fact that they have their priorities in order, is fucking ignorant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instances are 1 hour long. Raids will most likely be longer.<br />
He probably starts work at around 10 or 11 and has other commitments until he gets home at 8 and plays what he can for 2 hours because his life is boring for the 2 hours before he passes out from exhaustion. But you, feel that for him to get anywhere he has to work for 6 hours at a time and get lost in the crappiest, longest, most boring dungeon that was never revisited by your main unless you were helping your friends. But in order to be epic something has to be big, great grade two mentality.<br />
<br />
Perhaps to make you happier we can just increase the number of possible drops to 25 so that you have a 4% chance to get what you want. There's your accomplishment. Shock and horror aside, you sir are against the bell curve in the 2% of people who feel this strongly and Blizzards aware. But 75% of the popularity is going to be for it, Blizzard knows what they are doing and that is why your never going to make it in video game design.<br />
<br />
What I want to know is why someone who plays 10 hours in a block once a week should get more than a person who spends 2 hours every night for a week because of current designs.</div></div><hr />

Seriously who really plays WoW for it's PvP? It's a joke all around (since its a PvE game), would rather play a skill based AoC PvP even though that game is tera-bad.<br />

<br />
And you sir are an advertisement for contraception.<br />
<br />
In case you didn't notice (your reading skills are clearly sub-par), I was commenting about the trend in TBC to shorten the dungeon length, and the alarming news that even the &quot;popcorn&quot; instances in TBC were viewed by blizzard as too long and too hard. Their proposal that they would shorten instances even more was dismaying and I voiced that dismay.<br />
The moron too whom I replied took this as a personal attack and had replied to my first post with &quot;screw you&quot;, I feel I was well within my rights to respond with exactly the same playground mentality, I don't feel the need to take any kind of moral high ground when surrounded by such people.<br />
<br />
You on the other hand clearly haven't read or followed the thread, else you wouldn't be making an arse out of yourself in such a way by siding with the first fellow to bring the thread to school-yard levels.<br />
<br />
As I said in my second post, I'm glad he has had his personal tastes and likes catered too, god forbid that someone else, with slightly different expectations who had had them fulfilled previously (pre-TBC and to a lesser extent TBC) might expect similar treatment to the goldfish-like-attention-span-afflicted masses who seem to be the majority of WoW players now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then your couple hours of tired playing should reflect what you have in game. Everyone keeps saying that they have lives and things to do all the time, but complain that instances are too long. Well if you have just little time to play then you don't deserve the same rewards as the players with more time, and even players with more skill. <br />
<br />
But, then again, I think they should have dungeons where they are short to complete, but there will be various ways to go deeper into the instance for a longer and more challenging run that is not required to get to the last boss, but will reap better rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just before TBC came along, my guildies and I decided to do UBRS for sh*ts and giggles. My GOTW ran out just after we cleared Drakki's room- I remember being p'd off because I had to use reagents to cast it again just for Drakki. That means we cleared in just a shade over 1 hour. I had 2 pieces of T2, none of us had cleared a boss in Naxx. <br />
<br />
Admittedly BRD was longer, but how many people went for a full BRD clear vs UBRS? The fact is, people prefer short sharp instances, particularly if you're doing them in PUGs- the only time UBRS ever took longer than an hour and half was when you were in there with a bunch of PUG nubs. And when you do realise halfway through an instance that you're with a bunch of idiots and you don't stand a chance of killing Drakki, I'd sure as hell rather be half way through an hour long one than half way through a 3 hour one...<br />
<br />
And people DO have other commitments. The fact that you clearly don't does not give you the right to condescend to those that do. If you want a long, immersive lore-filled experience you'll have ample opportunity with either 10 or 25 man content- that's what it's there for. Blizzard provides opportunities for all play styles, whining that 1 out of the 3 doesn't cater to your needs (while 2 do, and arguably 3 with heroics), is just being bratty. Just relax and give everybody a chance to enjoy the game the way they want to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what? You want a medal or something?<br />
If it was your first try on UBRS then maybe you'd have a point. You cleared about half of the dungeon in just over an hour and it sounds like (aside from the reagent loss) you enjoyed it. Were you in the mood for clearing LBRS first? Would you have gone if your guildies had insisted that you cleared one then the other? Do you feel the need to insist that the dungeon be split in two just because you think it took too long to clear to Wyrmthalak then clear to Drakki?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Again, you're countering your own points there my friend.<br />
You run long instances with guildies, or with friends. Or you set a goal right at the start and stick to it. I remember seeing plenty of &quot;LFM BRD Emperor run&quot;, &quot;LFM Princess Run&quot; and &quot;LFM Tribute run&quot; in general and trade chats, people who were after short runs in long instances. If the group set-up was poor, then they'd wipe or disband and try again. If the set-up was good they'd maybe clear other parts of the instance or not. Player's choice.<br />
Shortening instances even further than TBC is not a good idea IMO and I said as such.<br />
You want shorter instances? Be happy, Blizz agrees with you, or at leasts thinks they'll get more money in the long run by catering to you as opposed to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

I could just as easily say to you:<br />
&quot;You want short, immediately gratifying, mindless gameplay? You have ample opportunity in BGs or arenas, that's what they're there for&quot;<br />
<br />
Personally I feel a play-style that I enjoy is not being catered for, in fact is being removed from the game entirely, but just exactly what Blizz does between now and WotLK is not set in stone so I can hope I will find something to enjoy. If not then as I am sure many people are thinking, i can just go and play something else.</div></div><hr />

Couldn't agree more man, Blizzard's reasons for making these instances easy and faster are perfectly good and fair. This game should not only be aimed for all those who spend several hours of their life each day playing WoW, but also for those who have so much less time, who are way busier with their jobs, family, other real life stuff. :)<br />
<br />
Also, can people in here lose the attitude? This namecalling and insulting is really immature, and only proves you are no better than the person your insulting.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how you can have such a big issue with this tbh, short term instances are basically classified as 5-mans, long term instances are classified as 10 or 25-man raids. That gives a perfect opportunity for all people in PvE. I don't know if you aren't able to get into raiding guilds or whatever, but if that's the issue, then you really have no good reasoning to be complaining in the way you are.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gilfanon</div><div class="date">2008-06-29, 09:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what? You want a medal or something?<br />
If it was your first try on UBRS then maybe you'd have a point. You cleared about half of the dungeon in just over an hour and it sounds like (aside from the reagent loss) you enjoyed it. Were you in the mood for clearing LBRS first? Would you have gone if your guildies had insisted that you cleared one then the other? Do you feel the need to insist that the dungeon be split in two just because you think it took too long to clear to Wyrmthalak then clear to Drakki?<br />
<br />
<br />
The point I was trying to make was that the Pre-TBC dungeons you referred to were not quite as epic as you remember through those rose-tinted &quot;pre-TBC good, TBC-bad&quot; glasses of yours. I enjoyed doing UBRS in an hour with guildies who knew what they were doing. I hated doing UBRS in 3 hours with PUGs who were clueless. Length of dungeon &lt;&gt; fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, you're countering your own points there my friend.<br />
You run long instances with guildies, or with friends. Or you set a goal right at the start and stick to it. I remember seeing plenty of &quot;LFM BRD Emperor run&quot;, &quot;LFM Princess Run&quot; and &quot;LFM Tribute run&quot; in general and trade chats, people who were after short runs in long instances. If the group set-up was poor, then they'd wipe or disband and try again. If the set-up was good they'd maybe clear other parts of the instance or not. Player's choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe you saw plenty of Emperor runs in General for the first year of WOW, but after that? Did people run BRD for the 20th time because of the epic, immersive feel of the dungeon? No, people stopped running it once they'd had fun, seen the content, and more importantly got the gear they wanted. The first time you run a dungeon is great from an &quot;oooh, aaaah&quot; perspective, after that it's all about rep, gear, or fun with guildies. If it's the first 2, short is good, particularly with Badges replacing the farcical &quot;lets run LBRS for the 25th time to see if my Wildheart Spaulders drop&quot; (they never did). If you're running it for fun it doesn't matter if it's short, because you'll run it again if you're enjoying it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shortening instances even further than TBC is not a good idea IMO and I said as such.<br />
You want shorter instances? Be happy, Blizz agrees with you, or at leasts thinks they'll get more money in the long run by catering to you as opposed to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, you didn't say &quot;IMO this is a bad idea&quot;, you said &quot;This is a bad idea, Blizzard is catering to the attention deficit console kiddy generation&quot;, thereby alienating anyone who has a genuine reason for enjoying short content. Saying you disagree with a design decision is fine, calling everyone who happens to disagree with you an idiot is not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Odd that you got all that from 3 sentences I wrote.<br />
I could just as easily say to you:<br />
&quot;You want short, immediately gratifying, mindless gameplay? You have ample opportunity in BGs or arenas, that's what they're there for&quot;<br />
Personally I feel a play-style that I enjoy is not being catered for, in fact is being removed from the game entirely, but just exactly what Blizz does between now and WotLK is not set in stone so I can hope I will find something to enjoy. If not then as I am sure many people are thinking, i can just go and play something else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, if I wanted short, gratifying PVP play, I'd do BG's or Arenas. Personally I hate PVP. Thank God Blizzard provides a short, gratifying PVE option, eh? Like someone else said, if you're so into deep immersive long content, why don't you raid? From the vids, the Sunwell Plateau seems like exactly what you're after- lore and length in abundance- I don't understand what your issue is, unless it's that you want long, easy content? Is that the root of it?</div></div><hr />

TBC basically did this, and WotLK is going to continue to do so. Instances are basically &quot;wings&quot; of a larger structure (e.g. the 4 instances of Auchindoun can be considered wings of one large instance). Especially since the person whining about lack of long instances thinks it's silly to break up UBRS and LBRS, why would they break up Sethekk Halls, Auchinai Crypts, Mana-Tombs, and Shadow Labrynth? Chain-run all 4 on heroic in one stretch. Voila, your level 70 BRD. Have fun.</div></div><hr />

everquest2 lost because everything took so long<br />
vanguard lost, because everything took so long<br />
LOTRO lost, because everything took so long (while sucking)<br />
AoC will loose, because it will take long until not everything will suck.<br />
<br />
on wow a lot of stuff did not take so long (like crafting, some instances)<br />
Blizzard started making even shorter instances - it worked out, more<br />
people bought wow.<br />
<br />
so math is: more accessibility - more customers.<br />

i dont whine, i liked the epic feel of some instances,<br />
i liked the vast areas of brt<br />
<br />
but honestly ... only ONE time ... after that it fucking sucks because<br />
it takes so long.<br />

its the right thing to keep most instances short, i honestly believe<br />
that a lot of players wont notice, because they lack skill and so<br />
every instance will feel epic and &quot;long&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
What blizzard is trying to do with this change is brilliant. Status-quo goes as follows in this example:<br />
<br />
Two Players trying to gear up their 70s from greens<br />
Player 1 has set aside one day a week to play wow for 7 hours straight.<br />
Player 2 has set aside an hour and a half every day.<br />
<br />
Player 1 has enough time to wait in LFG and Join 2 instance groups and one kara and finish the runs and therefore gets 30 Badges<br />
<br />
Player 2 has enough time to run 3-4 battlegrounds a day (Lets assume 4 for equal win loss ratio and an average of 200 honor per bg) because instance/raid groups are impossible. In one week he amasses 28 games, 14 wins, 14 losses, and gets 56 marks + 5600 honor.<br />
<br />
Even though Player 2 has played a total of 10.5 hours in the week and Player 1 has played a total of 7 hours, Player 2 gets barely any gear and takes weeks longer as it takes 3 weeks for one piece of S2 gear. Player 1 gets chances on 6 Heroic Bosses +Daily and 9 Raid bosses and Badge loot which is BT equivalent. What's wrong? People who play less in larger chunks become elitist and think that people who play more in shorter hours are casuals. Like Richtea. <br />
<br />
Try this yourself and see how fast the once a week player in the race gets T5 ready.<br />
<br />
Why this change is good? People who put more time into the game get more gear. Moral of the story... QQ less about the length of dungeons, get a group that feels the same as you and go run Raids all night long.</div></div><hr />

Weather you like it or not, there are people who like to achieve something or like to have something a joe ordinary on the server wont have. I'm all for giving players with time restrictions and such alike a viable option to get equipped well with less time spent, but Blizzard started giving everything to everyone. The trade skills are a joke as everyone can basically have everything and there's no need to trade/make deals - what should really be the point of trade skills. There are a few items you can make money of but way to less. <br />
<br />
For example, the AQ20/40 enchant formulas, made available to faction quartermasters in Outland in my eyes was a crap idea, same with the jewlcrafting patters from MH and the epic gems. Now they're telling me such stuff should be even more easily available, well I don't know what to think. <br />
<br />
As said, you need to make the game worth playing for both casual players and those who play it with a higher goal in mind, there's room for both. Sadly everything is turning to a point where everyone is the same and has everything.</div></div><hr />

Interesting, looking over my posts I said nothing about how long or often I played, you my friend, pulled that out of your arse.<br />
<br />
I do run Sunwell, and BT. After a year of levelling my chars to 70, then running heroics and Kara I wanted more from WoW than 40 minute blasts in dungeons, or one 2 hour snooze fest ('cus Kara once a reset for a year looses lots of it's appeal) a week. I'm glad I'm getting to see and experience the end-game content.<br />
<br />
I'm not glad that the aspect of the game I enjoy the most is apparently being removed and/or dumbed down, tho the inclusion of 10-man versions of raid instances will IMO be excellent. ZA is the most fun instance in game at the moment and the notion of more, challenging 10-man raid content is one of the better ideas blizz have come up with.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to get into the whole &quot;run multiple Heroic instances &quot; argument, if you can't see what the problem with that is, then you and I are not ever going to see eye to eye and we'll just have to disagree. We're clearly looking for different things in gaming experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A = Blizzard's Bank Account<br />
B = “Right or wrong, the customer is always right.” - Marshall Field<br />
C = Customers (Majority for less time spent in instances, more accessibility)<br />
D = Customers (Minority for more time spent in instances, less accessibility)<br />
<br />
Fact: C &gt; D<br />
<br />
Therefore:<br />
B + C = A+ (Epic Win - More interest, more players, more profit.)<br />
B + D = A- (Epic Fail - Less interest, less players, less profit.)<br />

<br />
The major complaint about TBC winged dungeons is that they don't feel like they are part of one large complex, but are instead disjointed hallways that often have little questing/lore tie-ins and seem to exist for no other reason that to have a dungeon to grind faction rep with. MgT is cool because you can make it to the balcony and look out onto the island and peer over into the raid instance, it exists in the world, the only other TBC 5-man that doesn't feel like it exists in it's own little isolated space is Ramparts. That is the criticism about the current winged design.<br />
<br />
edit: hell, blood furnace and shattered halls couldn't even physically fit inside the dimensions of the fortress they are supposed to be a part of. This greatly takes away part of the same feeling of immersion that you got from many of the old world dungeons.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. On non-raid nights we have ran an entire area of heroics just to get a &quot;raid&quot; type epic feeling to the night. And those nights are just as fun as running Kara/ZA or whatever 25 mans the guild is running now.</div></div><hr />

and the alarming news that even the &quot;popcorn&quot; instances in TBC were viewed by blizzard as too long and too hard. Their proposal that they would shorten instances even more was dismaying and I voiced that dismay.<br />
This comment they made wasn't about ALL TBC instances but only about a few of them (Botanica and Slabs i guess). So no, you won't get another BRD in WotLK, that's sure, but they won't shrink Ramparts either.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, the AQ20/40 enchant formulas, made available to faction quartermasters in Outland in my eyes was a crap ideaIt's only a crap idea if you wish for those enchants to disappear from the server.<br />
People stop playing or change characters, and since nobody runs those instances anymore (except once in a blue moon for shit and giggles), the amount of people knowing the recipes will decrease in time and the enchantment will just disappear form your server (or make one person very very rich).<br />
<br />
And I'm saying this a an enchanter who knew several of those recipes.</div></div><hr />

While I did enjoy BRD and it's &quot;epic&quot; feel....I only enjoyed it once or twice. After that it sucked to go to. Even while I level up alts to this day and hit ALOT of Azeroth I avoid BRD like the plague.<br />
<br />
Hardcore raiding is fun! Some of my best times in WoW were the long MC/AQ/ZG runs....loved it. 10 mans are fun as well. Pre-TBC didn't seem to have the last minute raids that we can pull together now. It can be a non-raid day for a guild and people are grinding/leveling toons and then all of the sudden a group of alts is running Kara or ZA. Raiding on a non-main keeps this game fun. On busy days; running a heroic in 90 minutes or less is fun. BG's/Arena, standing around a major city, or grinding reputation/primals is not always what everyone wants to do when they have limited play time...so the heroics/5 mans are great.<br />
<br />
What's my point? I've been every type of player in this game (other than a hard core Arena player). I definitely see all points of view on this, and it seems like Blizzard is trying to keep the game fun for everyone.<br />
<br />
Hardcore players have their 25 mans still. <br />
Casual players have their 5 mans/Heroics still.<br />
<br />
Both can meet in the middle for some 10 mans. <br />

What's wrong with letting those who cannot play 10 hours a day enjoy some instances? It does not in any way affect a hardcore player being able to run a 25 man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well that's a false dichotomy if I've ever seen one. Either you have all your 5-mans be less than an hour long, or else nobody with less than 10 hours a day to play can have any to enjoy. Good job with your clearly superior arguing skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see both sides in this, BRD was indeeed great. It actually felt like you were infiltrating a big ass underground city.<br />
<br />
And yes, most Aunchindoun instances feel like short and boring rail shooters.<br />
<br />
But it really doesn't have to be like this, look at the caverns of time instances. They are short and they are quite alright.<br />
Look at Magisters' Terrace, it's short and it's great too.<br />
So, if you're gonna make them short, do something to make up the feeling.<br />
Give us the balconies overviewing the surrounding landscape.<br />
Give us big scripted events where parts of the dungeon explode as you run forward against the clock.<br />
Give us big waves of mobs that pour out of every door forcing you to flee into a safe zone.<br />
<br />
There are a LOT of ways to make things feel cooler without making the dungeon take longer to complete.<br />
<br />
Well, in conclusion, More Time != More Epic.</div></div><hr />

There I said it :(<br />
<br />
It's about as fun as SSC or Heroic Shattered halls with a fury warrior tanking.<br />
<br />
Scholo + Strat UD were the best Pre-bc instances!</div></div><hr />

I agree. I think the ideal design would still have the wings exist as separate regions of the same, large instance location, but would be inaccessible from each other with their own entrance portals. That way you could have areas of the dungeon found in the other &quot;wings&quot; be visible from afar from where you are. It would break up the dungeons into smaller chunks without having what you have now in TBC.<br />
<br />
Another thing I don't really understand about the TBC instances is why is it that a 25-man raid entrance is sitting right next to a lvl 60 5-man dungeon entrance. I would think that logically, SSC should be located beyond the lvl 70 5-man with a shortcut attunement, kind of like how MC and BWL are.</div></div><hr />

But ultimately though, I think for Blizzard it's a question of development time/effort- you adopt a development methodology that meets as many player's needs as possible, and allows you to develop content as quickly as possible. You can see where they're going with using the same setting for 10 and 25 man content- why should they divide their development resources in 2 developing BT and ZA, when instead they can churn out two 10 and 25 raid zones and re-use the raid zone design and to a lesser extent mobs and bosses, in almost the same time? That means we get content almost twice as fast, which is what we all really want isn't it?<br />
<br />
Ditto 5-mans. BRD was huge and must have taken ages to design and build. I personally hated the place (but maybe that had something to do with about 15 Jailbreak runs for myself and guidlies). In the future, I'd rather have 2 new small 5-mans per year than 1 big 5-man per year that gets tired and a chore to complete after you've run it 3 or 4 times. Variety is the spice of life and all that... But hey, that's my personal preference, and everyone else is entitled to theirs too. What irritates me is when folks like Richtea bitch on these boards with the usual &quot;everyone who doesn't agree with me is a 12 year-old console gamer with ADD&quot; arguments. C'est la vie on WOW discussion boards I guess...</div></div><hr />

Something like:<br />
<br />
1) Beginner (ok rewards) -- Time: 1 hour or less.<br />
2) Intermediate (more time commitment; more challenging; much better rewards (some epic)) -- Time: 2 hours or less.<br />
3) Advanced (longest time commitment; most challenging; epic rewards) -- Time: 3 hours or less.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Times are in both normal and heroic versions. Eventually, you get the gear/experience/skill to make moving through the tiers that much easier</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HDTran</div><div class="date">2008-06-30, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, all this discussion actually led somewhere.<br />
<br />
I think people hit the nail right on the head.<br />
<br />
To make things more epic, length isn't a real consideration versus the atmospheric and boss aspects.<br />
<br />
Want to make it feel like you're infiltrating an entire city? Have the instance be up in the battlements entirely and allow players to look down and to the sides and see npcs battling eachother, eating corpses, etc. All manner of things. As long as you can make it seem like there is a huge, living, breathing dungeon/world with conflict or beauty or whatever around the instance... you get that epic feeling.<br />
<br />
I mean, if you think about it, that applies to everything. Look at the Lord of the Ring movies for example. Would having an entire movie be one battle feel more epic than the smaller length (in terms of screentime) battles that were shown? Nope.<br />
<br />
Effective use of cinematics, effective use of backdrop and atmosphere, and effective bosses and interesting trash encounters are what should make you want to play and give you that feeling.<br />
<br />
Especially in 5-mans. Not the time it takes to complete it (for which raids are already catering to).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Krisk</div><div class="date">2008-07-01, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few longer 5mans wouldnt hurt.<br />
<br />
But then again only a minority will be unable to raid 10mans that follows the storyline either if you play wow 5 hours a day in an organized guild or 2 hours a day in a casual guild. So my guess is most evenings will go into that in guilds. and long 5mans became obsolete in Blizzards planning.<br />
<br />
I admit, I miss the epic lenght BRD. Not for the loot but for the odd evenings where you wanted to destroy an entire underground city. I think if Blizz put some great plots and storylines into longer instances, people wouldn't complain as much about them. I agree that Short instances with an atmosphere and challenging encounters like CoT have been a great experience. I feel that Blizzard could improve tremendously on storylines within the Instances. Possibly quests given within instances, plots buildups inside the instance etc.<br />
<br />
Loot will always be better in 25mans and even 10mans than dungeons. Really not much to argue about with 5mans than taste of how to spend your evenings. those doing short easy 5man dungeons all the way through WoTLK will have horrible gear compared to the raiders.</div></div><hr />

I dont post often. I prefear stay out of this kind of discussions. but i m to damn sick on it atm. So here we go :)<br />
Allright! PVP gear for PVE players..... christ<br />
What about PVE gear for PVP players!!?? <br />
REPUTATION gear?? Left over worthless piece of shit as always ??. New colours and new name on it as last time ??<br />
<br />
And i did play as Mage for up to 3 month ago. <br />
And did give up WOW thanx to what they have done to that class and lack of DPS (so far) TBC is garbage for mages . FIX IT ! = give our dps back asap!<br />
<br />
I still Read the news here. <br />
catapults with ramming etc etc .... christ old damn junk u can find in 10 year ++ old games <br />
<br />
What about fix up the classes ? Do some USEFULL stuff then present tons of garbage to the masses/kids ?? <br />
<br />
Just getting sick of this lack of intelligence and poor devs that dont listen to the people that PAYS/PLAYES this game. <br />
<br />
I dont look forward to a TBC once again (10 levels and some new instances &amp; rewrokt old mobs as always) <br />
Give me a modern graphic motor (wow is 7 years 3 years online + 4 years to make) it looks horrible in detail level &amp; texture quality.<br />
<br />
Sorry to be negativ..<br />

Take an instance like Slabs. No one wants to run it unless it's the heroic daily or they're getting their Kara attunement. With 2.4, even that's lowered with the attunement requirement being dropped.<br />
<br />
I'm all for the shorter instances. It makes it possible to still do something on a short raid night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not have 3 different energy bars? 1 for each blood, frost, and unholy. Have each energy build proportionally to the number of each type of rune you are carrying. Then, all, have abilities cost different amounts of each. This would make for some interesting theory crafting, as well as support the class's 3 distinct &quot;roles&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The biggest problem is that they won't stop playing though. You'll be standing behind the same guy in line on release night, listening to him talk about how awesome his guild was, and explaining away the fact that he plays as a girl because he'd rather look at her than a guy because he's oozing testosterone, when in actuality, he enjoys playing dress-up because its the closest he's been to something female-esque in months. THEN, after he's farmed these dungeons for months, beat the biggest boss in the game, and still looks like the same PvPers running around, you'll get a chance to hear some great forum speech about how everything he's done is a life achievement instead of just wasting time, playing a game for fun. Expect personal insults, grammar correction, clarification on what he actually meant although it was nowhere implied in the text, and a general distaste for anyone who balances real-life accomplishment with free-time enjoyment.<br />
<br />
My one single gripe about WoW, which is not one that I spend hours on forums about, actually has been mentioned quite a few times. People say they want to be unique etc. but its always this false uniqueness that they get caught up in. When you have the best gear in WoW you either A. Look like you're the clown entertaining at a birthday party, B. Look like every other Cloth/Leather/Mail/Plate wearer in a raiding guild, or C. Look like the artist behind the concept for your class has been watching way too many Saturday morning cartoons.<br />
<br />
My solution would be that WoW could include more genuine character customization, example would be a ton more faces, BODY SIZES, armor dying, maybe even something like attack stance preference...but as I understand these were cut to make WoW an easier game to run. I think it could be done, but who am I to say. At least they're recognizing a little bit of this with offering more customization in WOTK, but who knows...if you could pick from like 10 different raiding sets that had the same stats, but looked completely different, wouldn't you feel like you had a bigger opportunity to be unique? No need to sink ridiculous amounts of hours, just bring some of your own creative ideas to the table and expect to do a moderate amount of work for it.</div></div><hr />

Paris sucks anyway, I wouldn't revisit it ever. Must be the most boring city in Europe.<br />
<br />
The WWI was decent, but there was ALOT of wasted time just walking around. <br />
If you weren't a Starcraft/Warcraft tournament fan (which I'm not) 50% of the WWI would be pure boredom, ie. that's about 12 hours in total ;-)<br />
<br />
I don't regret going there though.</div></div><hr />

You have no boyfriend and no life to speak of and so you spend your nights acting tough behind a computer screen on an internet forum because you feel that games should be overly tedious so that you have more stuff to do when you get home from school, since clearly your life revolves around this game. There are alot of cool female gamers that I've met over the years, but it's girls like this one who make the rest look bad.<br />
<br />
It's kind of sad how there exist people in society today who consider it an &quot;emotional feat&quot; to complete a tedious 4 hour &quot;World of Warcraft instance&quot;. I bet you're that kid on xfire bragging about the &quot;80 hours of World of Warcraft playtime in the past 7 days&quot;. Get a life.<br />
You fail remarkable.<br />
First of all, she got a life, that's kinda obviously. And she's enjoying it, but could enjoy it more (as explained) if WoW had certain changes reverted.<br />
<br />
Secondly, that kid on xfire -- that would be me. Except I don't use xfire.<br />
<br />
And last, I had a great social time drinking outside a bar in Paris with 40 other WoW players, and I've had plenty of real-life social interaction due to WoW. Often leading to non-gaming events, as well. But hey, I guess you work 18 hours a day, you don't have time to realise this happends.</div></div><hr />
