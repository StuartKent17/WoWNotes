Hi everyone, 
 
So, as you’ve noticed, today’s patch release has not gone nearly as smoothly as we would have liked. We’re sorry for how this has affected the stability and playability of the game while these issues have been ongoing. This has obviously not been the launch that any of us wanted. 
 
That said, we want you to know that there are currently several teams of people working hard to get you back in Azeroth and enjoying the Battle for Azeroth" />

Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
So, as you’ve noticed, today’s patch release has not gone nearly as smoothly as we would have liked. We’re sorry for how this has affected the stability and playability of the game while these issues have been ongoing. This has obviously not been the launch that any of us wanted.<br />
<br />
That said, we want you to know that there are currently several teams of people working hard to get you back in Azeroth and enjoying the Battle for Azeroth Pre-Patch as quickly as possible. We’ll share more details in this thread when we can.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience,<br />

As we work to identify the cause of these issues, we will be temporarily disabling the World of Warcraft Communities feature. The in-game and guild chat channels will still be available for use. The Guild Calendar may also be missing events while we address these concerns.</div></div><hr />

You never ever played the last build...this is not how it works. So you don't know if they did not work on it before, you did just not play that build that might have fixed it. This is a other issue then hitting a J key twice</div></div><hr />

The BfA content is already live, they just need to trigger the quests and scenarios that lead and give access to the new zones. So the pre-patch maintenance is actually the biggest hurdle. Please change your username.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that todays troubles are just a simple bug, apparently in the Community feature, which they temporarily disabled and are fixing now.<br />
On Expansion release, they do not have to deploy any server changes, new quests will simply unlock and thats that.<br />
<br />
EU launched several hours before its deadline and runs perfectly stable and smooth. Communities remain disabled, but we knew that from the US announcement earlier.<br />
<br />
Also, the whole &quot;world wide&quot; thing is not really affecting anything, because all regions have separate infrastructure anyway. If US goes down, EU is entirely unaffected, and vice-versa.</div></div><hr />

So you reported that having more then 10k people using this feature would cause massive load on the server? Pretty sure you having the press &quot;J&quot; twice is not what caused the unresponsiveness of the server yesterday.

Expansion “launch” will be just as smooth as Legion was. Prepatch is the entire 8.0 game. What they fix now is everything needed. Expansion launch is just a content switch. Any issues we’ll have is any leveling bottlenecks or quest issues, no server or UI problems.</div></div><hr />

you can see how the industry is only listening to the data they collect and that this data can be faulty was explained in severall books already.<br />

its not even the developers fault... its those people that today even sit there and say stuff like &quot;oh i dont even liked videogames&quot; aka &quot;i just have the money and i speak for the money but i want some fame too&quot;.<br />

I agree, I recall just a couple of months ago there as zero information from the Rift Prime team, and they opviously couldn't give 2 shits about the direction of the game nor the commentary of the playerbase at that time.<br />

Removed content? What content? You mean the Mage Tower?<br />
Nerfed leveling... this was since 7.3.5.<br />
Nothing works... One feature broke the server, so they disabled it. Now it's fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
thats why they now break the game a month before so they can say &quot;ah look at us... release was as smooth as a babys arse..&quot;<br />
<br />
Yes, it's all a conspiracy. They release prepatch on purpose, because they can say they had a smooth launch.<br />
Not because, I don't know... people want the game to be stable when the expansion actually launches.<br />
<br />
Moving all realms, all clients, every database etc to a new patch is always hard. Tons of shit can break that can't be tested since, no one has the capacity to stress test multiple hundreds of thousands of people logging in at the same time to a new patch.</div></div><hr />

I’m sure if you have the correct testing equipment, you would be able to simulate a code to traffic a certain amount of network load similar to the load produced in live scenarios, after all.</div></div><hr />

Jokes on you, my dude. I was bored during a period where I had like no money at all; asked for a free week to finish up some shit I wouldn't manage to finish in time, and they said &quot;Of course, have fun!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is treating their customers well, and they receive this reaction in return. Of course they need money to provide their services; that does not mean we can't benefit from it as well. Why am I, as a fucking swede, explaining this on an American website??</div></div><hr />

Blizzard Support regularly gives out free game time on request for players with lapsed subscriptions. I've done it a few times where I contact support and say &quot;I'd like to check out the changes without resubbing just yet&quot; and they gave me 14 days of game time. Companies caring about money is nothing new - but they're also composed of people who understand a great way to get that money is to foster good will with their consumers.</div></div><hr />

It feels more like the NA server admins are just bad compared to the EU server admins.<br />
<br />
Idk, it's weird.<br />
<br />
If I had to guess it would be that US admins have to work on fixes first so when EU goes live 24 hours later the EU admin already know how to solve known issues. Maybe the same people. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, compared to how things were in its first years, most WoW patches/expansions go quite smoothly so US usually benefit from the earlier launch.</div></div><hr />

The stuff was on the PTR and didn’t work well. So, people gave feedback about it and Blizzard didn’t fix it and pushed it live, just to disable it after 5 minutes. And this doesn’t include stuff breaking in a live environment that worked in testing.</div></div><hr />

Mind reading the Forums a bit more then.<br />
Most of the broken stuff was reported on Beta/PTR for weeks, if not months. It's normal things can be broken, but if people report something for months on end and you still ignore it, that's called incompetence.</div></div><hr />

You're the reason why this game will always be low-effort garbage. <br />
<br />
Servers are offline for a day when you pay for a subscription service, features get patched out because they couldn't figure out why it wasn't working in the first place, scaling is broken and it's staying that way until launch because God forbid things working before an expansion, there's nothing to do until the next week because they decided that we needed to sit on our thumbs for 7 days before getting the first quest of the pre-patch, and you really think there's no reason to be irritated as a paying customer? That people can't be mad because a lot of classes are going to be garbage until 8.1?<br />
<br />
I can't think of a game, be it f2p or not, that can get away with this much crap and not have the community on their throats. Blizzdrones are cancer.</div></div><hr />

Holy shit what? My dude there's putting words in people's mouth and you just shoved a fucking paragraph and a half in mines. <br />
<br />
1. Never said not to be angry about the technical issues.<br />
2. Never said not to criticize Blizzard.<br />
3. Lolwut? I'm the reason why this game will always be low-effort garbage? I loved Legion, and literally all of my friends loved Legion. Whether you did or not, I genuinely don't care, but I fail to see how you disliking the game is my fault. Constructive criticism is fine. Cynisim, isn't. <br />
4. When in God's name did I say people can't be mad about changes? What in ANYTHING I said previously stated ANYTHING about class changes?<br />
<br />
You're clearly angry about the state of the game. Speak up without feeling the need to call &quot;Blizzdrones&quot; cancer, and maybe people may actually listen to you. <br />
<br />
PS - I'm one of the first people that will criticize Blizzard. I hate the new MW. I hate a lot of the class changes. But I discuss it. <br />

Thats a problem with MBAs, not devs.<br />
<br />
This not even uncommon in the software industry (or even many engineering industries). Usually its because they need sales to happen at a particular time so that they can be included in a specific quarterly report.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think were pretty justified to act this way when we pay around $210/£140 per year for a game that really doesn't feel as if its even been beta tested for the last expansion or so. There are already some classes they have given up on making feel good and are going to have to wait till 8.1 for game play updates despite them having months to fix them, leaving people who main them with a bitter taste in their mouth. Not even talking about numbers just classes that feel terrible, like shadow priest. <br />

<br />
I reported 3 months ago that in your garrison you cannot fish enormus fishes with the new fishing skill levels (WoD = 100 + lures 10-40) anymore... mostly small ones...<br />
GG it is still in the game... I wonder why do I even try sometimes. No more RIding turtle for you kids.<br />
<br />
More like they really aren’t concerned with how fishing in the Garrison from two expansions ago is working right now.</div></div><hr />

You will get 10k+ dps :) Plus you cannot craft legendaries anymore because you need 800 skill... hahaha + you cannot fish big fish in your garrison anymore because you need 700+ skill LOL. <br />
I reported all these bugs on beta... yet all in the game. This dev team is a joke...</div></div><hr />

If you lapse on your subscription (aka fail to uphold your end of the arrangement) they're not going to give you time or chances! LOL They only give an F about the dollars/euros/pounds/etc in your pocket.<br />
Huh. I was unsubbed since July 2016, wasn't planning on coming back any time soon, but wanted the Christmas reward (achievement), since I had all the ones before that. Asked for a free day to get that, got a free week instead. Got my achievement, logged off and didn't sub for another 6 months. I also got a week on another account once, because I forgot to mail all the gold and BoE stuff to my main account when that old account lapsed and I didn't want to sub for a month just to log in once.<br />
<br />
They really do give free time if you ask them nicely (and not too often, probably).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Servers are offline for a day when you pay for a subscription service, features get patched out because they couldn't figure out why it wasn't working in the first place, scaling is broken and it's staying that way until launch because God forbid things working before an expansion, there's nothing to do until the next week because they decided that we needed to sit on our thumbs for 7 days before getting the first quest of the pre-patch, and you really think there's no reason to be irritated as a paying customer? That people can't be mad because a lot of classes are going to be garbage until 8.1?<br />
<br />
I can't think of a game, be it f2p or not, that can get away with this much crap and not have the community on their throats. Blizzdrones are cancer.<br />
<br />
The game has been unavailable for a day or more in the past. They usually just give everyone a free day.</div></div><hr />

Guessing you have never played an mmo before? Patch day problems are common and normal. Also, most of the broken stuff is new, so not quite sure what you are talking about.<br />
<br />
i have played this game since it launched, i'm well versed in 'patch day problems' the sarcastic response of my post was in response to the things that aren't working right now that were all reported during beta testing when they started testing the pre patch events there then on PTR, and still they didn't listen to those reports and as such it has gone live with all the issues that were reported upon weeks/months ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously there's one set of game developers, but there are also definitely different server locations and teams maintaining those servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But they don't handle game code problems, only server infrastructure.<br />
The issues we have are problems with bugs mostly.</div></div><hr />

There are already some classes they have given up on making feel good and are going to have to wait till 8.1 for game play updates despite them having months to fix them, leaving people who main them with a bitter taste in their mouth. Not even talking about numbers just classes that feel terrible, like shadow priest. <br />

<br />
I blame Activision and the whiny playerbase for the problems the game has. <br />
Activision for imposing such strict deadlines onto the developers and the players who complain about content droughts, expecting to be spoonfed an endless amount of fresh new content in an unrealistic time.<br />
I honestly don't think this expansion is ready and needs at least another 6 months in oven. But with everyone constantly breathing down their necks, they are being forced to push the expansion out and hope they can fix the bugs later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get that.<br />
<br />
But, I looked through the PTR forums and could not find posts/reports related to most issues which broke this week. There were reports on some, but very few that I found. Or things that were in the ballpark, but still different enough to be unique and new issues. If I'm wrong, feel free to link the forum reports that link to the blue post of known issues and I'm happy to admit my error. But I was not having any success trying to do this.</div></div><hr />
