The newest addition to the Warfront lineup in 8.1 is the Battle for Darkshore between the Night Elves and Forsaken. This Warfront plays out much like The Battle for Stromgarde but with a few minor additions or changes.<br />
<br />
What is Different?<br />
<br />
The intro to the Warfront is notably longer. You kill your way to the center of the map and take on two different commanders as well as many troop camps before you actually begin the collect and capture part of the Warfront.<br />
Wood can now be collected from fallen enemies such as Ancients and catapults/glaive throwers.<br />
The names and models of the familiar buildings/vehicles now have Night Elf and Forsaken flair.<br />
Instead of a gate to break down before taking out the final commander, you must destroy 4 cannons on ships offshore. Your vehicles will do this as normal, but there are also two spear launchers on the shore that you can pilot to help out.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Map<br />
The Map is very similar to what you see in the Arathi Warfront.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Stage 1: Purge Camps and Defeat Commanders<br />
You will spend a good portion of the beginning of the Warfront killing trash and defeating two commanders on your way to you main base. Both factions start on the coast and work through Auberdine before establishing a base at Bashal'aran. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Building your Base<br />
Once you defeat the commander in Bashal'aran you begin to establish your base as normal, creating the Barracks, Altar of Storms, and Armory. Eventually you will work on upgrading to a Stronghold, and creating catapults/glaive throwers from the Plague Works/Glaive Works.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront18.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront18.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront19.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront19.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront23.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront23.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront27.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront27.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront30.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront30.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Mine and Lumber Mill<br />
The mine and Lumber mill are still capturable, with the mine being just to the south and the lumber mill being to the northwest.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront25.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront25.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront26.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront26.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront31.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront31.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Acquiring Wood and Iron<br />
Wood and Iron are looted much like they are in the Arathi Warfront, with the notable addition of being able to loot wood from fallen enemies such as Ancients and war glaives/catapults. <br />
<br />
<br />
Iron (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1541-iron) - Iron is the most important resource in a Warfront. It is used to build/upgrade buildings, get additional support, upgrade and recruit troops and vehicles, and also in getting buffs from your base's altar.<br />
<br />
Iron is accumulated passively once your team takes control of the nearby mine. Passive iron is collected at the main hall.<br />
Iron can also be collected by mine caches at the mine.<br />
<br />
Wood (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1540-wood) - Wood is not as useful as Iron, but is needed for certain aspects as well. It is used to upgrade troops, buildings, and for buffs from the altars.<br />
<br />
Wood does not generate passively. You must collect it by chopping down trees or from mobs.<br />
Peons will cut down trees or you can cut them down yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront13.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront13.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront33.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront33.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront34.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront34.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Constructing Buildings<br />
You construct buildings in the same manner as you do in the Arathi Warfront, by collecting Iron and Wood and spending it at the construction stations. While the buildings might have different names, the benefits that they provide remain unchanged.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorebuildings01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorebuildings01.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorebuildings02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorebuildings02.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorebuildings03.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorebuildings03.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorebuildings04.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorebuildings04.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorebuildings05.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorebuildings05.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Building Benefits<br />
Buildings still provide the means of advancing a Warfront.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stronghold - This building is acquired automatically at the start of the fight once you take out the opposing commander and claim the initial base. <br />
<br />
Required to construct any other building.<br />
Can be upgraded twice.<br />
Upgrade 1 provides more peons, faster troop production, and commander troops.<br />
Upgrade 2 provides more peons, faster troop production, increased damage from certain vehicles and allows commander troops to use special abilities.<br />
<br />
Barracks - Barracks is the powerhouse of troop production. Once constructed, you are able to recruit troops that will defend the keep and attack enemies as they travel along paths. There are many different troops from basic grunts to healers, some of which requires areas on the map to be captured first. You can specifically recruit 2 bodyguard units at a time to follow you into combat.<br />
Armory - The Armory is utilized to upgrade the armor and weapons of your troops.<br />
Plague/Glaive Works - This building allows you to build vehicles, which are necessary to take the enemy base. There is a limit of three active vehicles at once.<br />
Shrine - Grants temporary buffs at the cost of Iron.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Capturing Bases<br />
North of your main base are several bases that need to be captured to progress the Warfront. The three center line bases are required to allow your catapults/glaive throwers to advance towards the final capture point.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront35.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront35.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront36.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront36.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewarfront39.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewarfront39.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorebatvehicle.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorebatvehicle.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Base Benefits<br />
Certain bases, such as Gloomtide Strand, will allow for more unique benefits to be acquired. Taking these bases will allow you to recruit a powerful abomination/ancient to fight for you or provide mounted combat for a brief time by spending resources.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshoreabom.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshoreabom.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorevilebat.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorevilebat.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Ending the Warfront<br />
Much like the Arathi Basin Warfront, the way to win is to construct your base and then take the bases up to the final capture point, Lor'danel, which is capturable only by allowing your vehicles to bombard the two towers while you kill the commander. This plays out exactly like Arathi but with Night Elf and Forsaken aesthetics. Once Lor'danel is yours, instead of a gate to break down you must destroy 4 cannons on ships offshore. Your vehicles will do this as normal, but there are also two spear launchers on the shore that you can pilot to help out. You then take a small flight to a base offshore and kill the final commander.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Changes to Darkshore<br />
Darkshore has got a few changes with the addition of this Warfront. All of the changes from the prepatch are here, but a few additional locations have been added.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
World Quests<br />
Unlike Arathi Highlands, when your faction controls Darkshore you have access to a large amount of world quests as well as the typical rares and world boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/thumb/darkshorewq.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/november/darkshorewq.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfront Service Medal Vendor<br />
8.1 also adds a new currency called 7th Legion Service Medal (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1717-7th-legion-service-medal) / Honorbound Service Medal (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1716-honorbound-service-medal). These are acquired from Warfronts as well as Incursion World quests and can be spent at a vendor near your Warfront table in your capital city.<br />

<br />
I like them much better than the pre-MoP dailies. That's all the reasoning I need and the explanation that you deserve.<br />
<br />
Something tells me you just liked gathering them all up in one place, getting them done at once and be done with it. Am I right? <br />
<br />
Also, m+, war fronts, artifact weapon building and all associated skin collecting content, and new questing content like Suramar were new things for WoW. FFXIV does that latter bit (max level story quest content) much better but eh, still new style stuff for WoW at the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will start by saying that I do not find world quests to be perfect - but dailies were worse imo.<br />
<br />
I legit hated dailies, wq are so much better to me. With dailies it felt felt mandatory to do every single one each day, unlike world quests where I can pick and choose the ones I do based on the reward etc. In addition having to run to the hubs and manually accept each quest was a pain in the ass. With world quests I can look at my map see whichever ones I wanna do, go directly to them - complete and move on without having to go back for a turn in. In addition there is a lot more overall variety of world quests than there ever was with any one daily hub so I am not doing the exact same wq every day like I would with a daily(Turtles exluded - they really need more options for the turtle wq's). The biggest issue with world quests now compared to legion - has nothing to do with the world quests themselves and everything to do with people don't like the rewards as much. For example many people do not like the azerite system so they don't care about the ap wq as much, the gold on the wq's is very low so it doesn't feel as rewarding as legion, the missions have much worse rewards then legion missions so the war resources don't feel great to gain, and finally there is no paragon system yet so the rep from wq and the rep tokens feel useless.<br />
The issue currently is with the rewards not the system.<br />
<br />
P.S. The one thing I did like about a couple of the daily hubs was when you were progressing a story through it - BUT that actually had nothing to do with the system(daily quests) that was delivering the story. It could easily be done with world quests or any other system.</div></div><hr />

You mean: &quot;females&quot;. I wonder why does Blizzard try to appeal to woman players? They are not the ones who pay the sub or buy the expansions.

This. People who like WQ or dailies are the same who play repetitive games like candy crush or other phone games without being bored.<br />

Pretty much every game ever created has some form of repetition, all FPS games are the same shoot, kill, blow things up and repeat.. Games like Team Fortress 2 and Overwatch are repetitive.. <br />
<br />
All racing games are repetitive, all RPG's are repetitive, in other words every game ever.. And some are more repetitive than others and yet people still play them..</div></div><hr />

I dunno, when Arathi is up, the queue time is always under 1 minute for me. I feel like maybe people are playing the hell out of it. So maybe the real question is when will WoW players realize that people like different things?<br />

The only improvement is a lack of a hub that you have to go to first, then spread out around the world to do the actual quests. That's it.<br />

Gotta love the mentality that goes into people who spew that. &quot;Well, someone has a different opinion than me, and even if tens upon tens upon tens of folds of people voice that opinion rather than mine, it MUST just be because they're a vocal minority.

I don't think the content is lazy per se.<br />
<br />
It just doesn't have any meat to it imo and that &quot;Warcraft 3&quot; feeling they mentioned just doesn't exist. Only Warcraft 3 thing about it is the resources and even then that resource dump is just Broken Shore but faster.<br />
<br />
However I agree. The whole &quot;morale is low&quot; crap and people attacking others for liking it with the tired and overused arguments is just petulant.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong 8.1/8.1.5 both look good. But it;s just not enough to get me back playing full time. I do keep the sub running for when I feel like it but for me WoW is definitely my second MMO atm.</div></div><hr />

It just doesn't have any meat to it imo and that &quot;Warcraft 3&quot; feeling they mentioned just doesn't exist. Only Warcraft 3 thing about it is the resources and even then that resource dump is just Broken Shore but faster.<br />
<br />
However I agree. The whole &quot;morale is low&quot; crap and people attacking others for liking it with the tired and overused arguments is just petulant.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong 8.1/8.1.5 both look good. But it;s just not enough to get me back playing full time. I do keep the sub running for when I feel like it but for me WoW is definitely my second MMO atm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gotta agree pretty much with all you said.<br />
<br />
I just was making the comment of the usual rhetoric and circular whining so to speak :)<br />
But for me? Cancelled WoW a while ago, and just waiting on Classic now. It's still a good gamne, just not what I want from an MMO anymore is all.</div></div><hr />

I might roll one on a fresh alter for the frer 370 and that's it. I didn't even do it a second time on my main, my boat research are frozen. Not even bothering. You fucked up with this content blizz, It's so hard to even care for it.</div></div><hr />

I love the new forsaken and night elf model kit, and I only wish the warfront had further revamped the area like arathi was (but it is understandable why they had more time to do so in Arathi since every building was wod era, and in this one a lot of new models had to be made, particularly forsaken). <br />
I also like that this one allowed for further story on the night elf side, with introduction scenarios. I'm looking forward to doing them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who is the &quot;blinded jobless neckbeard fanboy&quot; here considering you answer..mmmm :') priceless. Nobody is forcing you to play it. It's on the same sub anyway.<br />
<br />
More seriously: Classic is not for you and it is FINE that you love retail. I have nothing against it and play it myself. What I say is that a niche of old school players like myself, will chill out and enjoy some &quot;koselig tid&quot; like we say here in Norway with Classic. And sub numbers for Blizz will go up.

Warfronts are just kind of boring with little variance in between them. Dragging them out for a longer period isn't going to help much.<br />
<br />
The resource collection minigame in particular I feel drags down the experience. The first half of the Warfront just has most of the raid pick up items because there's no point in pushing farther than Highperch if you don't have Demos unlocked. Doesn't make for a very epic experience. <br />
<br />
Hopefully the Heroic mode that is coming will be more interesting.</div></div><hr />

Been that way since i started playing in TBC and will forever be that way.<br />
Plenty of stuff i personally dislike does that mean it should be removed? Of course not. Silly attitude to have.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has and probably will always make stuff for different play styles. Warfronts...definitely not made for the hardcore. (Im gonna go out on a limb and assume mmo champ's demographic is mostly hardcore...) If that's your play style you probably wont like it. <br />
Not everything will be made for the hardcore and not everything will be made for the casual. Everyone plays a game for different reasons especially in a mmo. Im not saying people cant give their opinion, hopefully explaining the parts you don't like instead of useless blanket statements, but the sooner people realize things are made for a large group of different play styles and not just their play style the better.</div></div><hr />

Expeditions are a treat compared to warfronts.<br />
Not even comparable really...<br />
<br />
Sorry but no. Warfronts are better than islands. They’re both bad but if I had to choose between the 2 I’d easily pick warfronts. <br />
<br />
Islands are literally a mindless trash grind with practically no reward unless you get lucky and even then you might get something not great. You run around killing normal/heroic level trash mobs as if everyone loves doing trash in raids/regular dungeons. They literally put reskinned dungeon trash into a small map for you to grind until you’re done. <br />
<br />
Only thing that makes them passable is the random events however these appear very randomly and closer to the end of the expedition. A lot of the time we didn’t even need to go into any portals or kill any of the extra mobs that come from the events since they appeared when we were at ~8k.<br />
<br />
At least with warfronts you can choose to do a few things. You can run with a group and take areas, kill the rares and do hostage events or you can farm wood/iron. It’s pretty bad but not nearly as boring as islands imo.<br />
<br />
I usually need to throw on tv or focus on work while doing islands because focusing only on islands is so fucking boring it’s actually mind numbing. It’s like walking into a normal dungeon with 0 loot and just trash.</div></div><hr />

FF14. I enjoy it quite a bit plus I'm a huge fan of the FF series.<br />

<br />
I didn't once mention BFA in my response. I haven't even logged into retail in weeks. I'm just saying that even if given the option, I wouldn't play Classic because there are a fuck ton of games released during the past decade which are miles better than the dumpster fire that is Vanilla WoW. Like Red Dead Redemption 2, Warframe, Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate and Witcher 3 to name a few that I've been playing lately.<br />
<br />
It just really brings my piss to a boil whenever I hear someone say &quot;Classic is going to save WoW&quot;. Like a bunch of Religious Zealots that think it's the second coming of Christ. Well I've got news for you. It isn't. The few hundred thousand brainless plebeians that give a shit about Classic will not make a difference to sub numbers or ActiBlizzard's revenue in the long run. It'll just be swarmed day one by retail players who will get bored shitless and quit within a few days. The only ones that will stay are the fanboys and the retail players that take delight in griefing said fanboys. It'll be an absolute mess. <br />
<br />
And finally. Not even the biggest of Blizzard White Knights would defend a WoW Mobile game. Especially after the shitstorm that Diablo Intolerable kicked up. If they did, I'd be the first in line at Blizzard's HQ with my torch and pitchfork, wanting Ion's head mounted on my wall.</div></div><hr />

Nah. 1st warfront is ok because you get 370 for alts.<br />
Other than that it's just a insanely long and boring grind. <br />
Atleast islands are somewhat fast.<br />
<br />
To be clear. Both sucks alot...</div></div><hr />

I don't even have an active WoW account anymore and I'd play a WoW mobile game, depending on what it is. If its a generic hack n slash mobile action game then no way, but keeping with the Pokemon theme he talked about I'd play the shit out of a mobile Pet Battle game.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but like 90% of the posts (yes I know i'm making up this % but you can't deny it's a majority) &quot;fighting to make a better game&quot; from MMO-C for example are just a pile of &quot;this is shit&quot; &quot;I don't like it&quot; &quot;anyone who support this is stupid&quot; and a large etc. You are fighting nothing (well if you are not the type to &quot;fight&quot; like that then apologies).<br />
<br />
Also, the real problem is, no one can like nothing and no one can not like nothing, you are not better than the ones liking it as they are not better than you from that.<br />
<br />
The day this community understands that wanting to make a change on something works better with constructive comments and being polite, and also that liking or not liking something should not brand you as someone who is better, that day, wow, hell, quite a lot of games and communities will start to be better, but oh well, this is the internet and we are all humans, 0 hope for that.</div></div><hr />

You and a lot of other people are correlating high participation with players finding the content fun and engaging. High participation =/= good content. That's a mistake that Blizzard makes as well. Obviously queues are going to be quick when they're available every couple of weeks (concentrating the players queuing into that time window) and rewards a guaranteed 370 ilvl piece which is equivalent to Heroic Uldir</div></div><hr />

The fundamental flaw with your comment is that high participation =/= bad content either. <br />
<br />
To which I again return to the concept that some people like different things. Clearly you don't like warfronts, and that's fine. but you've made no argument to demonstrate they are objectively bad.</div></div><hr />
