Solo Rukhmar Kills<br />
If you are having trouble finding a group for Rukhmar or looking for something to do while waiting for Patch 6.2, give soloing Rukhmar a try!<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
Really strange change?&quot;Capturing a point in the following Battlegrounds now takes 6 seconds (down from 7 seconds).&quot;<br />
Open to hearing feedback on it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/595271146045452288))<br />
Seems unnecessary for the reasoning that ninja capping is already in a good place, making it easier seems too much.<br />
Is it? Get a lot of feedback that maps like AB and Gilneas are very stagnant after initial captures. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/595275125114609664))<br />
essentially you've turned team fight maps into ninja the ninja maps. When gy were the culprit.<br />
I can see that argument for AB but not Gilneas. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/595282917389008897))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
&quot;spectacle creep&quot; sounds like blaming the audience for not liking your product... &gt;.&gt;<br />
Did you watch the video? Has nothing to do with blaming the audience, it's about how making things exciting gets more difficult. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/595264363969155072))<br />
Guess MoP suffered from spectactle creep, but I personally enjoy the story as long as we don't regress in spectacle<br />
I feel the opposite, MOP was pretty toned-down and relaxed imo, except for SoO. A nice breather. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/595463602544504832))<br />

Wildstar - Q1 Earnings Call<br />
NCSoft had their Q1 2015 earnings call recently and while they don't release subscriber numbers, they do break down sales by game, which gives us an idea of how popular the game is. Wildstar had another smaller decline this time around.<br />

Because its called MMO champion,not wow champion.It gives info of other games as well.<br />

<br />
Coming from a guy that did solo Galleon as you mentioned, on my paladin tank, while &quot;freak out&quot; is a bit of an overstatement, I did question the design of these bosses. It felt very unrewarding killing world boss in a current expansion, even if you're decked out in gear.<br />
<br />
Imo, if even the thought of &quot;I might be able to solo that world boss&quot; comes to mind, they're doing it wrong. I've never once thought &quot;Hey, let's try and solo Doom Lord Kazzak!&quot; back in BC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That number is sales in Korean Won (KRW) and it's in millions (MN), so those sales figures are around 3,000,000,000 KRW. Mind you, that's not as much as it looks. This website here (http://coinmill.com/KRW_calculator.html#KRW=3000000000)puts the value at about $2.7 million dollars. That seems like a lot, but maybe my standards of a successful company are too low, haha.<br />
<br />
Not defending Wildstar or NCSoft really, just recognised &quot;KRW&quot;.</div></div><hr />

EVE Online is 12 years old and during all that time it balances at around 300k - 500k subs. And it doesnt look like it goes out anytime soon. A game does not need eleventy bajillion players to be successful and profitable. Which btw is also a good indicator for WoW.

I am Brazilian and I do think this is a normal and necessary adjustment. Brazilian Real has been losing value in the last months. It's currently US$1 = R$3. So, yeah... we're still paying cheap for 30 days (US$6). Quick comparison (entertainment industry) is that this is the price paid to go watch a movie.<br />

One thing I'm reading between the lines on this raise is this:<br />
Assinatura Recorrente: Sem alteração<br />
Suscripciones Recurrentes: No cambiará<br />

<br />
These prices will start on May 20th. What Blizzard wants with this move is not only to increase prices, but to make customers HAVE AN ACTIVE SUBSCRIPTION - The attractive here is to continue paying the same price as before if you subscribe and remain subscribed.</div></div><hr />

WoW is not a good game anymore, but it's still popular. It survives until today merely because it was once great, so the 7M remained shows how this game was attracting that made people keep playing even most of its content is gone. A good game doesn't necessarily lead to massive player-base, think about Planescape:torment, how many players are still playing it? well count me as one, I play WoW no more not because it's old, on the contrary, I play lots of classic games such as Baldur's gate and icewind dale--20 years later I am still intrigued by them, I stop playing WoW because it's not fun, it dull and it's completely dead, simple as that.<br />
<br />
To me the spirit of WoW just withered, it's perished, fading into the oblivion, they went astray too far from the classic D&amp;D rule which results in extremely fast consuming mode. WoD is worse than rubbish and I am sure that's what WoW would look like in next 5 years if it would live to see the sunshine of that day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even in worst case scenario, the game had in Q1 at least 135,000 subscribers if the 2.7 mil dollar sales (KRW converted to USD) generated by CREDD subs ($ 20). Also i keep reading posts on the official forums and reddit about new and returning players (i am new -after open beta- player) so i don't think the game is dying. It may not generate the estimated revenue Carbine and NCSoft need, but i'm sure the game won't die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is 180 days using recurring subscription already costs US$34,00 (33,99), which translate into R$102, while game time costs R$78. So, the raise in prices will affect us one way or another, and it will still be cheaper to just buy game time. Recurring subscription is not worth for a while now.</div></div><hr />

My personal opinion:<br />
There won't ever exist a game that deserves the Wow Killer title...<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
... because that title belongs solely to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
There wont ever be a WoW killer because MMO's of today just create a game and hope it will do well,there is never any back story or a continued line of games like blizzard did. We got the start and mystery of the first Warcraft then 2 and 3 added in more lore and by then everyone was hyped about a MMO and that is why it is so successful because of its lineage.</div></div><hr />

For people saying that WoW is dying. For some people's point of view, yes it is, however on the other side of the coin raiding is the most accessible it has ever been. I did an LFR yesterday and people were talking and having fun just killing stuff. That's what wow is really about, the social experience. I understand that a social LFR is a pretty rare thing now a days as most people que up stay quite and just spam buttons until the boss falls over. I've ran with countless PUGs and made quite a few friends that i'll raid with when my guild doesn't have a raid going on. At no other point in wow has it been so easy to just drop into end game content kill some bosses for a couple hours then log out. WoW isn't dying, its become streamlined.</div></div><hr />

Simpletons like you need to get it through your head that when people say the game is dead, they mean the game. Not the subs, the game itself. Whenever subs go down and people have a positive reaction, hoping in vain once again that Blizzard might eventually make the decision to turn things around, they're accused by the simp brigade of basing their opinion of the game on the number of subs, and now I can see why: that's the only metric they themselves understand.<br />

Thank god i left the game a few months ago (after getting tired of WoD's first raid, imperator was quite interesting but the overall raid felt a bit bland in terms of theme), sadly a lot of friends are a bit annoyed at the price change because it doesn't feel justified, dollar price is a bit lower than it was a few months ago here in chile and the economic situation has not gotten any better to justify a price increase... heck even some of them even discussed just starting to use bots in order to get some gold back and not having to pay the game (i still think it's quite stupid doing so... considering is around a 20% price increase) but if anything this hurts the already small ammount of money some people make here.<br />

What if I tell you this game is still a walking corpse even it would have 15M population? fortunately people have brain, maybe that's what you are so lack of. Players are bleeding away because this game sucks very very much, 7M remained and have you asked why? because this game WAS good so they linger a little longer, they stay for a while and find nothing would be changed then that's the end of this game. The game content is fucking completely dead and what's the fucking point of mentioning subs? Do you even have a share of Blizzard or something? you are not some white knight and Blizzard doesn't really give a shit about your defense so why just can't you see---all players need the same thing which is to make this game fun again but you choose Blizzard's side to instigate them to make this game anti-fun by every second.

You don't need to lecture anyone. Why? Because you failed when you said &quot;There are 7 million people that disagree with you,.....&quot; ...BEEM RED ALERT... 7M subs =/= 7M individual players. WoW is NOT the best MMO in the gerne right now, but yet it's the most populated game. So, when someone says that &quot;WoW is dead&quot; he is tryng to say that it's not the game it was before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wildstar needs to pull their head out and make the game more &quot;casual&quot; friendly. Casuals pay the bills, there just aren't enough hardcore players to begin with. Tack on that lengthy attunement quest and they nailed their own coffin shut. I personally enjoyed the game quite a bit. But I don't have the free time I did when I first started playing mmo's, which is the story for many. I lost interest in the game when I got to the attunement.

They could save their game if they'd stop being so stubborn about it.<br />
<br />
Please define me your idea about how casual the game must become. I prefer the Attunement over the instant access to the raids. What do you prefer? All the Raids available at the launch of the game/expansion with an attunement procress to keep you busy, or delay content releases like WoW did with BRF?? You should know it's the same strategy, but attunement is faster if you know what to do. But BRF-style release of content is not fast enough and it COSTs you $ 15 for every delayed month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry but you don't get to strut around like a male peacock and preach artistic vision when you are gambling with literally millions of dollars worth of shareholder investments. Your job as a developer is to create fun, accessible content that people will want to play. The entire point is to create a profitable product, not show the world how wonderful every one of your ideas are even when everyone else tells you otherwise. Having dealt with some of developers during the beta process, it was amazing to see how deluded many of them were and it was exactly that they caused me to cancel my pre-order and never look back. <br />
<br />
I have to admit, it is somewhat satisfying to see how right I was. The amount of egotism and sheer insanity shown by the developers during the beta has no place in a successful MMO. Or any video game at all, really.</div></div><hr />

Just a matter of time before they hit up the US/Europe for price hikes.<br />
<br />
They admit on their conference call that they were planning on gouging the remaining subscribers to make up for lost subscriptions... just a matter of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they nerfed the attunement quite hard - you pretty much only have to do every 5m dungeon once and some quests. which you would do anyway, in any mmo. GA is fairly easy with all the new, better gear you can get through new dungeons/solo content like vet shiphands/contracts. the new (1boss) instance has ulduar-style normal mode/hard mode mechanics, which (i hope) they keep doing with upcoming raids. i think i'll start with wildstar again if there's a new expansion or a halfway decent f2p system (given the huge amount of visual stuff in housing/gear/costumes/pets/mounts etc. maybe even possible - or simply a &quot;play for free, but pay standard-subscription 10€ or buy CREDD if you want to raid/go into arena&quot;-hybrid f2p) gets introduced.</div></div><hr />

Oh...my god...have you done no research on Wildstar in the past few months?<br />
<br />
ALL THEY HAVE DONE in the past year was listen to the players...with new casual content (shiphands, pets, toys, Star Comm basin, contracts) while still giving hardcore players content (protogames, Augmentors 20) and finding a middle ground (Bay of Betrayel, Lightspire, Omnicore)<br />
<br />
They are trying there hardest to do what the players want.<br />

Wildstar is a much better mmo than WoW at the moment in my personal opinion, it just doesn't have a well known IP to carry it...was the same situation with RIFT.<br />

I think the game deserved a bit more success tbh. I played at launch then left and went back for a couple of months a few months ago. Now I'm not white-knighting Wildstar by any means, but if there is something you cannot accuse them of, is not listening to the players. They changed so many things based on player feedback. Hell the only reason why the game was so hardcore with attunements at launch was because people &quot;said&quot; they wanted it. Turns out.. They thought they did, and it flopped. So now they are picking it back up.<br />
<br />
From my experience they changed a whole lot of things and the game is now way more casual friendly. The cities (on the pve server, not the pvp one) are full of people and the community is friendly. So if anyone looking for a change of pace from WoW I can definitly recommend it now.<br />
Despite all its flaws.. That game got housing spot on! It's amazing. Looking at WoW I cannot help but think about the differences in design philosophy between the two companies. Blizz has said that they made the Garrisons so useful cause otherwise people wouldnt bother with them. In Wildstar housing it's very useful or needed, and yet people spend hours upon hours working on it and visiting others houses (yes, it;s actually social). Why? Because housing is so damn fun! I mean, we play a game, shouldnt &quot;fun&quot; be the reward? Isn't what we are here for? With that said, even if it's a nice game nowadays, it still falls short on other aspects which many people have pointed out many times, so I just say &quot;judge for yourself&quot; (there are free trial options).<br />
And regarding the &quot;fun factor&quot;. I love WoW, played since Vanilla.. But WoD is seriously pushing the boundary for me and pondering on whether to leave or not.</div></div><hr />
