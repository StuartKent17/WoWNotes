* Players in a raid group will once again no longer be eligible for quest credit, except for specially-designated Raid quests. We are continuing to explore ways of allowing players who want to engage in solo or small-group questing while in a raid group (for example, while waiting for a Highmaul raid to form, or in a Rated Battleground queue), without also allowing raid groups to trivially complete quests that were never designed with groups of that size in mind.<br />
Wait, that isn't how you are supposed to do the apexis daily?<br />
<br />
Moroes' Famous Polish now has a 30-minute cooldown (up from 10 minutes) to keep it consistent with our transformation cooldowns.<br />
Well @%$^ you, too. Maybe you should take the fun out of Blazing Wings and ALL transformation/shapeshift items with a CD â‰¤ buff duration. Fun is dangerous.<br />

I'm surprised Blizzard never nipped this bug early. Why did it take them so long to deal with what glaringly contravened 10 years of design intent?</div></div><hr />

Man I am so glad they got that out of the way instead of the other crippling issues that haven't been fixed in months/years. I'm sure there were so many threads detailing how absolutely unfair it was that one vanity item had 1/3rd the cooldown of every other one in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I beg to differ very hard.<br />
<br />
My guildie has stacks of at least 10 of each armor token, +3 +6 +9 615 630 645 and that's after he got the 20 followers to 650 achievement like a month ago. He has both the bunker and the salvage yard, whereas I had only the salvage yard and barely got the 20 followers to 650 achievement yesterday and have only a few 615 630 tokens.<br />
<br />
So if anything, the bunker is way OP over salvage yard. it definitely hurts me more, and others, that they changed this.<br />

<br />
Because if you actually stay on top of your followers they're mostly useless. I mean, Goredrenched is one I would've liked to have seen stay, as it's a good jump from 600 still; however, they're upping followers to 675 now, so new pieces (boost to 650, 660, 670 or whatever) will drop from Garrison missions, or the War Mill.<br />
<br />
I've got a stack of War Ravaged pieces that are useless, and a handful of Blackrock. Anyone who actively works on their followers likely has most of their 20 fully geared up to 630-645 by this point. Hell, I'm deactivating 645s just to level up new followers since the low level quests keep showing up. But I'm never going to use a War Ravaged piece on them when they hit 100 because I'll just use a Blackrock piece and boost them right up. And even with those going now, I'll just slow down on leveling new followers.<br />
<br />
In short, they're basically vendor trash. Maybe it'll up the chance that a 3, 6, 9 upgrade piece will drop in its place, which we'll actually be able to use.<br />
<br />
What they DO need to get on is alts! I've still yet to be bitten by the alt bug mainly due to how exhausting the thought of working up another tier 3 garrison will be. Making the armor pieces BoA would be a huge step in the right direction, for one!</div></div><hr />

Why are they going on about consistent cooldowns when the actual transformation items (a category the Polish does not belong to anyway) are completely out of whack when it comes to their recharge time and duration.<br />
<br />
What was wrong with having the Polish being chain used? Nerfing fun for the sake of it. <br />
<br />
The Piccolo change isn't too bad. At least you won't have to equip it, wait for the internal CD, and unequip it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I tested the Piccolo on the PTR. Sure, the cooldown is not that great, but otherwise the item works quite well. Your character starts to dance and so do players nearby. However, you can move around while dancing, which is something I find quite cool honestly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bunker/Mill is not OP. You only get 6 chances per day to get follower items, and much of the time, the work orders yield only scraps instead of actual follower items. I have, at present, 9 level 100's, all with fully loaded garrisons, and all actively running missions. Not a single one of them is hurting for follower upgrades. Only 3 of them have War Mills, I stopped building War Mills after I realized how much better the salvage yard is for follower upgrades. I get *many* more than 6 six chances a day for follower upgrades with salvage boxes. Goredrenched is the only thing I have any use for as far as the follower set pieces go, and thats only because I recruit a follower from the Inn each week and level them, usually getting them to epic quality before reset, so I can see what traits and abilities theyll pop, and whether or not I'm going to keep them. With 6.1 giving me the ability to reroll just traits or just abilities, I'll likely stop recruiting. As such, I'm glad to see the set ilvl pieces going away, they are pretty much just vendor loot. <br />
<br />
This will hurt new level 100's a bit, as they'll no longer get easy follower upgrades via the salvage yard, but for any character who's established and actually been running enough missions to make their salvage yard worthwhile, this is a very welcome change</div></div><hr />

I'm not interessted in the twitter feature and not going to use it.<br />
But wouldn't it be better if there was a bit.ly feature integrated (or sth like that)? Looking at the Item URL...this will take up too much space in a tweet, wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
Twitter has it's own URL shortner.</div></div><hr />

Lol you crack me up not like they are putting the raid and or content design team on making the tweet ability (or maybe they are) lol.. I seem to remember a few years back when Blizz said about adding in a Real ID feature in and everyone went nuts saying how bad it would be for the game and invasion of privacy and what not over it, now everyone loves it as makes inviting friends on other servers so much easier..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I know this is lengthy, but I am colorblind type Deuteranomaly. Most colorblind persons are this type, about ~6% of males. I go through what I see and as a normal visioned player you can maybe get a sense of what I see.<br />
<br />
As well, and more importantly, I also try to show that even as a normal visioned person you can use the colorblind options to see ground effects, spells and abilities better than what you see normally, for example making red ground effects appear yellow and more obvious.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps everyone that watches it and I thank Blizzard for being so proactive with their colorblind options.<br />
<br />
Cheers!<br />

And how pray tell is a completely optional option in having twitter in game going to affect game play? I mean I have yet to see a completely rational and well thought out reason as to how a twitter option that you don't have to use is going to affect how you play the game..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2015-01-30, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What's the point of this?<br />
<br />
&quot;Follower Weaponry and Armor Set tokens (War Ravaged, Blackrock, Goredrenched) no longer drops from salvage. Weapon and Armor enhancement tokens that can upgrade a Follower's weapon or armor item levels will continue to have a chance to drop from Salvage Crates.&quot;<br />
<br />
Two reasons probably. Salvage Yard was a little too Â´mandatoryÂ´... and was much better than War Mill/Bunker. But probably the bigger reason is that there is no real use for 615 and even 630 tokens any longer, you still need a few now and then, which you can get from the Mill or from missions themselves, but most people who have been doing missions for a month or so, are probably sitting on a stack of the 615 they have not much use for. In another month, the 630 tokens will probably be the same way for many people. The 3/6/9 tokens are much more valuable at this point.<br />
<br />

<br />
What they DO need to get on is alts! I've still yet to be bitten by the alt bug mainly due to how exhausting the thought of working up another tier 3 garrison will be. Making the armor pieces BoA would be a huge step in the right direction, for one!<br />
<br />
I think their philosophy is going the other way. It seems that many of the rewards from our mainÂ´s missions will now be BoA, so we can send actual gear tokens to our alts who can then create gear for themselves. IMHO, they donÂ´t really want to make missions easier on alts, rather they want our mainÂ´s missions to be able to benefit our alts more.<br />
<br />
I donÂ´t think there is any way they could make it less time consuming for alts to do follower missions. I tried to keep up with a couple alts for about a week, and it was just too much time. I quickly decided that they only thing I would do is get a follower with their main profession to lvl 100 so they could work the profession building to the max. Even just doing daily CDs on 10 alts is a big chunk of time, I donÂ´t even bother with their mines, herbs or followers... it would just be too much.<br />
<br />
I am happy that soon my main will be able to send 630ish gear tokens to my alts to use once they get to lvl 100, along with the cheap crafted goods that will be coming in 6.1, this will allow them to not have to grind anything before being at least heroic dungeon and LFR ready.</div></div><hr />

Name another quest in game that is currently getting raid credit, which probably shouldnÂ´t be? Of course this change is targeting the Apex dailies. What people donÂ´t realize is that currently 5-mans can do it almost as quickly as those raid groups, and this will be even more true once we get gear upgrades with 6.1</div></div><hr />

Man I am so glad they got that out of the way instead of the other crippling issues that haven't been fixed in months/years. I'm sure there were so many threads detailing how absolutely unfair it was that one vanity item had 1/3rd the cooldown of every other one in the game.<br />

It's not the cooldown. It's the short duration combined with an drastically increased cooldown. The item crew and balance people have too much free time obviously.</div></div><hr />

mark my words, if there is a way to make this suck for people, it will be found and exploited.<br />
<br />
People compariing this to realid ... well realid got neutered. they backed off the forums using your real name, and then put in a option to not show your real name even to realid friends.<br />

in the end this is probably a money grab ... some deal was struck with twitter to do this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chaud</div><div class="date">2015-01-31, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So I'm curious, if there's a lag to post to twitter, is my Client posting directly to twitter, or am I actually providing my credentials to Blizzard and they're logging in as me and posting from the server side?

<br />
It posts to Twitter just like any other 3rd party site / client, but there is a little delay for some reason. Maybe they rate limit the screenshot uploads or something. <br />
<br />

Chaud - By default did the wow interface automatically address the tweet to you or did you just tweet yourself?<br />

I did, I didn't want test tweets showing up on people's timeline.</div></div><hr />
