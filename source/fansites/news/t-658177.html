<br />
Let's say 5% of the players got their protodrakes in naxx 25 before they removed it. They were satisfied with the proportion and didn't want more people to have it after 3.1 to keep these mounts as real achievements.<br />
<br />
Now let's say only 2% of the players got their protodrakes in 3.2, it makes sense for them to wait until more people get them before removing it. And really, even with full iLvl 226/232 gear, these hard-modes won't be easy, we all know that. It's not like there will be a flood of protodrakes when 3.2 goes live.<br />

It'll be 4-6 weeks after launch before the whole instance + hard modes are even available. They want people to have an incentive to double back and keep hitting up Ulduar for those few weeks. And the &quot;overgearing&quot; issue won't be as severe, given that the hardmode gear won't be available, and there will be little easy-mode gear to go around.</div></div><hr />

Really?! They nerfed that fight into the ground on 10 man. It was never about the gear before. It was all about avoiding multiple things in every phase.<br />

<br />
I just don't like the giving away of something that's hard to get in current situations, but easier once we get tiers higher and can still get. Most of what I said does apply to at least the 10-man though.<br />
<br />
Hopefully once all of the tournament is going, with all bosses up, they'll remove them from the game.<br />

<br />
And the majority of ppl who can't do it now probably won't be able to do it even with better gear :)<br />
<br />
Also, the reason they removed the dragons from Naxx10/25 Achivements was probably because there were new drakes in Ulduar, and since the Colliseum is gonna be a pretty small raid (like ZA was in TBC) maybe there won't be any new mount until 3.3?</div></div><hr />

imo nightfall/6min maly was harder than anything for ulduar meta, cause it required some stupid group stacking, while undying and ulduar stuff can be done with any kind of setup</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe not. The announcement that they aren't being removed kinda obviates the need for a month-long heads up to those guilds needing a few more kills for the drakes &amp; putting them on notice that they ought to make a final push soon.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think we'll see it August 4th.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CaptainArlong</div><div class="date">2009-07-22, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Might have something to do with the new bosses in the new raid being released one week at a time eh? Think about it, 3.2 hits, you only have 1 boss in the new raid, then you have no choice but to go to Ulduar. 2nd week, you have 2 bosses. 3rd week you have 3 bosses. That's a month of waiting for the whole raid to be ready.</div></div><hr />

lolwut? Why should casuals get something iconic like the Frost Wyrm?<br />
<br />
Give it out to PVE people in Icecrown, when they complete the 3.3 &quot;glory of the arthas raper raider.&quot; Not any time before that.<br />

Every rep grind in this game besides &quot;The Insane&quot; title is stupid and easy to finish.<br />

(if you're not an arenafanboy and my sarcastic quasi-dismissal of arenafanboyism is misplaced, I apologize.) <br />
<br />
<br />
Rofl @ thinking PVE takes nearly as much skill as Arena. Or that BG's take nearly as much skill at arena.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I have the 10m drake, 5 hardmodes on farm, 75% win in all BGs (except AV, go horde!), and am in contention for Glad in 3's and 5's on my main atm.<br />
<br />
By FAR the most intensive aspect of this game is Arena. Nothing else comes close. Sure, it can be hard to succeed in 25 mans or BGs due to other bads in shitty gear on your team, but that has nothing to do with you or your skill. Those same bads also can get carried in PVE/BGs. You can't carry people that get hit by rockets on Mim to glad.</div></div><hr />

Flawed reasoning, the 1 month notice of drake removal and 3.2 were stated from the beggining that they might not line up.<br />
it was always a possibility that the &quot;1 month&quot; warning would be given, 3.2 hit the next day, and then a month later the removal. Therefore it's still possible that the patch is in less than a month</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what you're saying. It would take 1,000 weeks, that's roughly 19 years.... no, I don't think even the most incompetent players could take close to two decades to achieve it.<br />
<br />
I am saying that it would take casuals more time to get good enough to actually pull it off to get it and that's not dumb, that's just a longer learning curve, either from not having the time or just misunderstanding their class. But then, they wouldn't be casual anymore, would they? So yes, casuals will never get the drakes.<br />
<br />
What is stupid is glorifying yourself as some hardcore player then QQing when suddenly it will allow a few not-so-hardcore-but-not-casual-either players get the drakes too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There didn't seem to be a lot of achievements, and the reward being just a land mount might sort of back that. Is it extra fast or just another land mount? If it's an ordinary land mount that just looks different it doesn't qualify as special enough by the standard blizzard themselves set forth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Higher item level for the entire raid might push the struggling but alright guilds over the limit, nothing more.<br />
<br />
I only see Blizzard giving more time to good players and guilds who have had lag/attendance problems/THE SUMMER/drama/etc bring them down.<br />
<br />
Somewhat serious to hardcore raiding alike, cannot always escape the sting of Summer WoW.<br />
Then we have the dozen or two servers that only had the upgrades needed for decent primetime raiding happen just a month or so ago.<br />
<br />
My previous guild suffered both of those above, and sadly collapsed due to the childish drama that usually follows when things don't go well.<br />
But now I'm back with my old friends and their guild, which gives me another shot. A realistic and quite possible shot.<br />
<br />
This is a brilliant move on Blizzard's part, hardly 'catering to the casuals and bads'.<br />
It's giving good players and guilds more time; as not everyone has been blessed with properly working realms chocked full of reliable and good raiders that are a dime a dozen.</div></div><hr />

If you were a semi-semi-two-and-a-half hardcore player you would have the mount already. Or wouldn't have to worry about the time to get it, because we would still have, at least, 30 days to get it.<br />
<br />
310% mounts aren't needed for the content. You can play the game and you won't miss it at all. There is no-sense in giving it to everyone. It's already a joke how &quot;Of the Nightfall&quot; = &quot;Jenkis&quot;, any group with 8 dps with 4k+ (naxx 10~25 gear) can one shot sartharion 10, but it's only a tittle, who cares. But a 310% mount should be more powerfull. Gear from 3.2 is way more powerfull than 3.1, Firefighter can be a hard fight for casual atm, but after progression on Argent 25-man, it will be easy enough for everyone get the reward.</div></div><hr />

a shaman saying that there is no reason to do 10 man hard modes is pretty sad.<br />
<br />
and yes, i am pissed about this change, at least a little.<br />
<br />
i got back 2 months before naxx ended and was 3 achieves late of getting the plagued drake, i didnt whine when they were removed, i didnt beg for a door prize, i just told myself that i would get the next one as soon as i could.<br />
<br />
I'm pissed that blizzard seems to always flip flop on &quot;serious&quot; issues (not serious, but when it comes to things like this, were people are trying to beat a clock because of what was said, it's fucked up to switch midstream).<br />
<br />
If they said they werent ever going to remove the drakes fro the get go, i would still aim to get it, but of course i wouldnt have spent so much time in one sitting.<br />
<br />
i think thats what alot of people are pissed about, either way &quot;bads&quot; aren't gonna be picking up these mount, as these hard modes are more than the dps checks of naxx, but the people who got it weeks ago could have spent there time doing something different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I use the term &quot;semi-hardcore&quot; for people who do raid, who try hard modes, but not 5-6 days a week lifelessly. I raid in 25man 3 days a week, and my guild is at Yogg-Saron. I have a lot of time to spare, i just didn't give a shit about the drake until now.<br />

I think a lot of people are getting caught up in this PVP vs PVE issue with drakes. The problem with PVE vs. PVP is that there are no lock out issues associated with PVP and you could potentially play 16+ hour per day in area in efforts to catch a lousy group of arena teams the same time as you. PVE dungeons don't change arena team ques do, PVP has no lockout schedules, I can clear Ulduar in 3 hours and I'm sitting on my hands the rest of the week. Getting 2 3 or 5 people together for arenas is easier than 10 or 25 for PVE content. <br />
<br />
I think that blizzard should actually go back and reinstate the old drakes. Do it with an exception; set the item level not to exceed a certain level like they have it set for Algalon 10:<br />
<br />
Herald of the Titans:Defeat Algalon the Observer on Normal Difficulty without anyone in the raid wearing any equipment with an item level higher than 226.<br />
<br />
Remove the drakes if the level cap if ever raised again, like they did with the bear mount in ZA. This way the people with the skill and the coordination to get these drakes can still do so without being bothered by downed bosses in lock out periods.</div></div><hr />

Calling someone a casual player isn't insulting. I'm a casual, but I won't lie saying &quot;I'm almost a hardcore&quot;. If you are a Rival or Duelist, you can say you are &quot;Almost a Gladiator&quot;, but it won't make you any better, really.<br />
<br />
If been constructive is agreeing with you, sorry, I can't.<br />
<br />
People who already have the reward worked hard for it. People who are almost getting it are working hard for it. Now Blizzard says: No need for working hard, you can do it latter!<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I won't agree with this. If you are a really good player and didn't manage to get the achiev because of e-drama/irl-drama/internet issues, bad luck. But wait, next patch there will be a brand-new protodrake waiting for you, you just need to work hard to get it. But no, now you can just zerg all former hard modes and get the old mount!<br />
<br />
And I'm waiting to someone tell me why casuals need a 310% mount. It's just show off, the best you can do with it is farm or have a easier time while doing dailys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casual does not mean less skilled.<br />
<br />
Seeing as you're a moron, let me explain to you what casual means.<br />
<br />
<br />
Player X and player Y both play Warcraft. Player X plays hardcore, player Y plays casual.<br />
<br />
Both players are just as skilled at playing the game, because there both intelligent people. They both understand the game and its mechanics.<br />
<br />
Now lets take a look at there raiding.<br />
<br />
Raid boss A is a hard boss. He needs many weeks to take down. Player X has all the time to sit through these<br />
time consuming wipes, while player Y does not, because he has a life.<br />
<br />
You seem to not know the difference between a BAD player and a HARDCORE &amp; CASUAL.<br />
You get bad casual players AND bad hardcore’s.<br />
<br />
TIME.<br />
TIME.<br />
TIME.<br />
TIME.<br />
<br />
Did I mention time? No?<br />
<br />
TIME.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually player X + Y would both have their drakes by now if that was true.<br />
<br />
We did 1-2 achievements per week. Thats it (except at the start with the really easy ones). <br />
<br />
We raided 3 hours, 1 day a week in 10 man, and got our drakes back in June, even before the nerfs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocaa84e3d5fa</div><div class="date">2009-07-22, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see myself as a casual maybe semi hardcore raider http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-achievements.xml?r=Bloodhoof&amp;cn=Pacer&amp;gn=J+P+F is my armory profile as you can see my guild killed freya +3 nealy 3 weeks ago and havent done any new hard modes since.<br />
<br />
The reason to that is the lack of good players in my guild willing to come for weekend raids, we raid friday and saturday 20:00 to 23:00 that is 6 hours total per week. Friday we use to clear most hard modes up to mimiron (we have been aiming for him the last two weeks) The saturday nealy nobody wants to join the raid and we then started trying to 9 man mimiron hard mode just to get experience with the fight.<br />
Usually the first hour of the weekend raids we end up looking for one last good dps, yet we still managed to get this far.<br />
<br />
Also if you look through everybody in my guild you will see only 9 people got knock x3 on wood, why is that? well we pugged a guy from the realm we knew were decent http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-achievements.xml?r=Bloodhoof&amp;cn=Mâga&amp;gn=Kings+and+Aces.<br />
<br />
<br />
All that being said, these achievements are something that requires alot of time and are not extremely hard I would actually say they are on par with the heroic (5man) achievements when you just got to lvl 80 (green/blue geared, maybe 1 or 2 epics from heroics that you have already done)<br />
<br />
I hopefully will soon get this mount and I think blizzard took the right choice, anyone with the skill to get it should imo get it, just because 3.1 was a fast patch I dont think all these people should miss out on it. Im also 99% sure blizzard will remove it:<br />
<br />
5 weeks after patch is out (all bosses in colliseum is unlocked)<br />
9 weeks after patch is out (4 week/1 month after all bosses in colliseum is unlocked)<br />
6 weeks after patch is out (all bosses in colliseum is unlocked + 1 more week)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleom</div><div class="date">2009-07-22, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact is, if with every content patch the hardcore raiders(Hardcore means people who can spare time, not &quot;skilled&quot;) are going to have some cool mount what will the casuals get in compensation? Nothing?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I disagree. I would say &quot;hardcore&quot; does mean more about skill and less about time. You can give a bad player all the time in the world, but if they don't have a fundamental grasp of the concept of &quot;Don't Stand In That!&quot; or don't fully get their class, then they will never see a drake. Whereas the &quot;hardcore&quot; people who grasp boss mechanics, read up on their class, understand gemming/enchanting, know about their hit/defense/expertise/haste cap, know their rotation or what skills are best used situationally, etc etc are going to progress and will be rewarded. Time also plays a factor into it no doubt about that, but I would argue that skill is far more important. <br />
<br />
As to the matter of the drakes, I don't really think it's that big of an issue. They WILL be removed, mark my words but it's just a matter of time. Naxx had a far longer shelf-life than Ulduar and to be fair to those who may miss out on this drake, they are keeping the rewards around to make it about equal in time. After that time is up they will be taken out. <br />
<br />
No big deal, no need to whine :) <br />
<br />
As for all the other hardcore people whining about all the players running around in their Loleblem Gear you don't need to worry about anything because those people will never be in your raid. You can have an app show up in full T8 or 8.5 but when you look at their achievements and see they've never made it past Auryia or half the Keepers, you have nothing to worry about. It's not like they can just ninja into your raid/guild. <br />
<br />
These are going to be the same people who were decked out in full T7.5, barely pulling 2k dps who waltzed into Vault and then for the next month had Emalon roll their shit so hard it broke their monitor. <br />
<br />
We have nothing to worry about with these badge/reward changes.</div></div><hr />

Your post should be clarified with the added statement &quot;and rushed in and did it right away so they had nothing left to do but whine that casuals are ruining the game.&quot; since you seem to think anyone who did not do it in the first month is a casual as opposed to a skilled player who either did not have the time or feel rushed to do it right off the bat and then sit around waiting for more content to do. Some &quot;hardcore&quot; players actually like to take it in steps so they have something to look forward to instead of jumping straight to the end and then puttering around message boards QQing about the lack of content.<br />

First, 10m hard modes aren't that hard. If you can't clear then, then you or your guild obviously lack the required coordination and playing ability to down them. It doesn't matter if you play two hours a week or ten. You can still achieve your PvE proto drakes eventually if you're capable of it. In the end it's just a mount and if it really bothers you, then you're probably an elitist baby. That being said, if more of you QQer's had the 25m PvE drake I could see some validity in your complaining. But since you don't, maybe you should stop crying and try for something harder.<br />

People like to better than other people, period. They like to have something to prove it, or to show it. If everyone have it, you will need to check the records so we can see who achieved that first, and this is boring. People want to look strong, powerfull, and they work hard to achiev this. Giving their simbol of strength to everyone makes them less diferent, ordinary. Again, people don't like to be ordinary.</div></div><hr />

what even makes you think that casuals are skilled equally to hardcores? no fucking way man<br />
casuals may be skilled but they are defintly wayyyyy tooo under skilled when u compare them <br />
to a hardcore raider,<br />
you are comparing the ppl who die to rockets on mimiron, shockwave on emalon, and other easy stufff<br />
to people who got their ulduar drakes?<br />
<br />
im definitly against this change by blizzard....310% speed mounts shud be as rare as possible<br />
whats the fuckin point when every 1 on the realm is on 310% speed mounts? ppl are saying that <br />
even if the drake is gettable but casuals will take too long to get it? BUT WHY DO THEY EVEN NEED TO GET IT?<br />
they dont need it..infact they dont even deserve it...i mean come on<br />
there is a lot of content in game for casual raiders,<br />
<br />
if blizz is so helpful to casuals....why dont give away glad titles?<br />
and vendor 310% speed mounts so that they can purchase it without having to use any brains.<br />
and yeah...give away frostwyrms too for them<br />

Sorry, but no one has to play 10 hours a day to raid at a top level if they are an intelligent person in WotLK. More like 10 hours a week, that's how long I spend raiding, and I've cleared everything in Wrath and have my 10m Ulduar drake already.</div></div><hr />

Rofl. Sorry but no, you're not a smart player if you spend many weeks &quot;taking down&quot; any boss in WotLK.<br />
<br />
Anyone who's ACTUALLY intelligent (rather than the nerds who think they are &quot;good&quot; and &quot;have a life&quot; but are actually fucking morons) can down bosses and not play 24/7. It's pretty fucking easy, unless you fail at pushing a button once every 1.5 seconds.</div></div><hr />

These mounts are designed similar to the Arena Gladiator mounts as rewards for the top tier of raiders and we will remove the rewards once we have introduced enough new and more powerful equipment to make the completion of these achievements easier than originally intended. Since these rewards are designed for such high-end game play, we currently plan to continue removing any similar rewards we make available in the future. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if people here have been keeping track of the new gear, but it is FAR better than Tier 8. Groups that can't do the achievements in the intended gear shouldn't get the reward.<br />
<br />
Also, the hard modes should be buffed if they are intented to be &quot;PvE Gladiator&quot; awards. Gladiator is for the top 0.5% of PvPers per bracket.<br />
<br />
The rusted drake alone has been obtained by over 9% of raiders. <br />

That is just the 10 man version though. It's shouldn't probably exist at all in its current form because it's being accomplished by ringers constantly. The values for the 25 man version are a lot more reasonable. All your numbers basically show is that 25 man guilds go and get this easily since they out gear it and already have a mastery of those fights.</div></div><hr />

4. Several Ulduar hard-modes are sufficiently execution-oriented enough such that you're not suddenly going to beat it even if you have Argent Coliseum gear. If your raid force is still dumber than a box of rocks, ilevel 245 gear is not going to help you get your mounts.<br />

Once the casuals get their lolemblem gear in 3.2 and start attempting some of the hardmodes required for a drake, they'll see what the rest of us have already contended with.<br />
<br />
The dates on the achievements will seperate those people that got their drake before 3.2, and the more unskilled players attempting it afterwards can be put in thier place by seeing that they still can't kill shit that other people beat before the patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now this sounds like a real elitist<br />
<br />
not the 'wah wah I'm so hardcore I can do hardmodes by only mouse clicking but bliz is handing out free rides to noobs' :P</div></div><hr />

Orbit-uary: No issues.<br />

Iron Dwarf, Medium Rare: No issues.<br />
Heartbreaker: Only issues were people not moving fast enough.<br />
Disarmed: No issues.<br />
Steelbreaker: Our primary source of wipes was lack of Fusion Punch dispels or people dying to Overload/Static Charge due to incorrect positioning. <br />
Crazy Cat Lady: Just a bit of raid stacking.<br />
Rare Cache: No gear issues here, just poor buff management.<br />
Lose Your Illusion: No gear issues, just people moving out of Lightning Charge / Blizzard too slowly.<br />
Knock, Knock, Knock: No gear issues, people nuking Detonating Lashers too recklessly, people not moving out with Static Charge, people neglecting Roots/Trees.<br />
Firefighter: No gear issues, people dying to Laser Barrage, Mines, Fires, Rocket Strikes, Frost Bombs.<br />
Saronite in the Morning: No gear issues, people dying to Shadow Crash or moving too slowly with Mark of the Faceless.<br />
One Light: No gear issues, people walking into clouds, straying from the group and getting constricted, failing to interrupt/run out quickly enough, poor sanity management.<br />
<br />
So with all of the above, the common theme is simple mistakes and inability to avoid scripted events. No amount of gear will remedy that.</div></div><hr />

Gotta hate summertime... Havent had a decent hardmode-raid in ages with quite a few of our best/core-raiders being on vacation or unable to play for whatever reasons during the summer. Luckily they are slowly coming back in the coming weeks and with this we'll hopefully have enough time for the hard-hardmodes like Freya+3, Mimiron and Yogg+1.<br />
<br />
The 10man drake is piss-easy. I really didnt bother with 10mans untill a few weeks ago. Now I've got all the requirements for the Rusted Proto Drake apart from Freya+3, which I will get done this week. Also got my BiS boots from Mimi hardmode&lt;3</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sabredragon</div><div class="date">2009-07-23, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know.<br />
<br />
All you people whining about this change...you're all a bunch of friggin' babies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casuals&quot;, as you put it, will be getting a 310% proto-drake that takes minimal efforts, a little RNG, and able to get online for the different Holiday achievements over the span of a year.<br />
<br />
What's the big flippin' deal if they're giving people more time for the Rusted- and Iron-bound proto-drakes? It's a mount. Big whoop. And as people have stated, just because you'll have access to better gear doesn't mean people are automatically going to be getting the drakes. Just because they have more HP and Armor when they go in a second time around, doesn't mean they won't die to the fire if they previously did. Which is the ONLY thing holding ANYONE back from these drakes, really.<br />
<br />
And you certainly won't be decked in T9 by doing heroics in time before they actually do take out the achievement. It'll take you months to be &quot;decked out&quot; in T9 by just doing heroics. Maybe T8 and T8-equivalents, but not T9.<br />
<br />
Also. People who are saying casuals can't be as skilled as hardcore people, and things to that effect... you're all a bunch of retards for saying that. Just because someone is &quot;casual&quot; doesn't mean they couldn't be hardcore if they put the time and effort into getting what they wanted. What if they could get the drake if they wanted too (personal skill, anyways), but their guild held them back? Or they just didn't care about it in the first place? I know quite a few people who could get the drake if they wanted too, but don't care enough because they think they're damn ugly in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Are you fucking retarded? How the hell is &quot;kill this tank n spank boss in X seconds&quot; not gear based? That's the definition of a DPS fight that is totally dependent on your raid's DPS.<br />
<br />
I can make flippant comments dismissing every fight in the game if I want to, doesn't change the fact that they're gear check fights that will become absurdly easy in 3.2.<br />
<br />
Try killing Hodir hard mode &quot;with proper buff management&quot; in full level 70 Kara gear, or even full Naxx 10 gear, and tell me it's not a gear based fight. Same with Ignis and XT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're not reading his post correctly. He never said gear doesn't help - he said &quot;Gear wasn't the ONLY thing&quot; stopping their kill. Yes - gear helps A LOT for dps to meet timers. But guess what, if people suck at the hardmodes right now, it's not only because of gear.<br />
<br />
Will gear help you avoid fires, flash freezes, laser barrages, smoke clouds, void zones, ...? NO<br />
<br />
The only fights where gear really might be the issue are Ignis, XT, and Hodir. But even if they can put out the dps, the gear still won't make people do their jobs on Ignis any better; it won't stop people from dropping gravity/light bombs on the raid; and it won't keep people out of flash freeze.<br />
<br />
Getting these achievements is NOT a gear issue. It's a skill issue.</div></div><hr />

I guess a person in full T9 that plays for 4 hours a day will still be labled as a *scrub with a 310%*, but who cares it was gonna happen sooner or later with the holiday events. It will still take some *skill* to beat hardmodes.... and by skill I mean people wiping over and over until they get emo and quit trying cause that's what casuals pretty much are.</div></div><hr />

It is never gear that stops you from killing bosses, but in most cases it can make up for your mistakes therefor alowing less skilled people obtain mounts.<br />

Must be the biggest fail ever wrote.. better gear, more dps, less stress and less opportunities to do a mistake which wipe raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, that's true. But if the mistakes are still people dying to shit they can avoid like fires, freezes, etc, then the gear won't be able to make up for that. We're not talking about people coming back and doing this at level 90, the new gear will only be 1 tier above current gear. It's not going to make up for 1/2 the raid dying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why most of whiners say: &quot;OMGOSH I WANT MY MOST UNIQUE EPIC 310 MOUNT&quot; .. well for what?<br />
<br />
Will you fly faster than Naxx 310 mount on 310 Ulduar mount? No. Then what? You change dark-brown drake for even darker brown drake and..?<br />
&quot;Mounts as define of skill&quot; - what a bullshit! Ok, 100 anonymous people will know that you playing better if you are flying on that black chicken. And The Earth will stand still after this? Or The Sun collapses? Or it's lack of fame among people who you don't even know and ever care about? Oh yeah.. that's worth it.<br />
<br />
And then - blizzard give you meeting stones, warlock's TVs and after patch they will give you tabards, teleporting you rigth to the instance. Where do you fly then? For ore or herbs? Doing dailies? Or sitting on flypad in Dalaran while AFK?<br />
<br />
Do hardmodes for better gear and faster mounts(if you need them), not for bigger balls, damn you. For feeling of teamwork and adrenaline, not for couple of bytes on the site.<br />
The game was designed as source of fun. And that's it. You transform it in self-confidence race.<br />
<br />
P.S. And I just imagine this: in the office you go to the boss and say &quot;k,lol, I've got my &quot;Glory of another instance fapper&quot;, noob!&quot; and boss will be like &quot;OMGOSH here's ur 10 000$ bonus, I bow before you, Master&quot;.<br />

<br />
Casual does not mean less skilled.<br />
<br />
Seeing as you're a moron, let me explain to you what casual means.<br />
<br />
<br />
Player X and player Y both play Warcraft. Player X plays hardcore, player Y plays casual.<br />
<br />
Both players are just as skilled at playing the game, because there both intelligent people. They both understand the game and its mechanics.<br />
<br />
Now lets take a look at there raiding.<br />
<br />
Raid boss A is a hard boss. He needs many weeks to take down. Player X has all the time to sit through these<br />
time consuming wipes, while player Y does not, because he has a life.<br />
<br />
You seem to not know the difference between a BAD player and a HARDCORE &amp; CASUAL.<br />
You get bad casual players AND bad hardcore’s.<br />
<br />
TIME.<br />
TIME.<br />
TIME.<br />
TIME.<br />
<br />
Did I mention time? No?<br />
<br />
TIME.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure who of the two of you guys arguing I find more idiotic. The one thinking all casual players are crap or the one claiming hardcore raiding is all just the advantage of having time.<br />
A hardcore raider does NOT spend more time playing this game than a lot, if not most, of the people that call themselves casuals.<br />
Personally I raid hardcore. All this means is that I have the choice to invest time when needed. We get an instance on farm much much much faster than a casual raiding guild would and once it's on farm we raid 1 day a week with 6 days to do whatever we feel like doing.<br />
During our farm state the so called &quot;casual players&quot; raid 4 times a week on average for 3-4 hours.<br />
<br />
A hardcore raider does in fact have more free time than a casual raider.<br />
<br />
Don't go calling hardcore raiders people with no life. Because it's just complete bullshit and far from the truth.<br />
<br />
If you (general) are a person that can spend a couple of days playing for more than average hours at a time on demand whenever it's needed, then I highly suggest you join a hardcore guild assuming you have the skill.<br />
<br />
Yes because skill is part of PvE too.<br />
<br />
You will have more spare time for whatever else you want to do outside this game and you get to use your brain to figure out tactics for yourself instead of trying to execute someone else's tactics.<br />
<br />
On topic:<br />
<br />
Given how ridiculously easy 10man hardmodes are, if you don't have that drake by 3.2 then you don't deserve it (I have friends that are casual and have it, so I am in no way saying all casuals are bad).<br />
<br />
The 25man drake is still pretty rare which is quite nice. And personally I find these drakes to be somewhat of trophies. They should stay rare.<br />
<br />
However I'm not opposed to them not removing them yet. 3.2 won't have a proper impact (gear wise) until we'll be able to consistently clear the entire instance. If they remove the drake by the 6th week from 3.2 release i don't mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never really understood why they removed the Protos.<br />
Even the Black one in Naxx 25... try Immortal nowdays, its still damn hard even with Ulduar gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rabidine</div><div class="date">2009-07-23, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good choice considering that the majority of the new protos achievements are hard modes which even with T9 will still require some effort and can't be zerged down like sarth3D. Ulduar protos aren't just one hard mode and a load of useless junk like getting a killing blow on a mob while on a vehicle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The irony here is the difference is still time. If I get paid $10/hr and work a full 40 hour work week, I get paid $400 pre tax. Now lets say I only have time to work 10 hours a week. Guess what, I still get paid $400 after 40 hours of work...it just takes 4 weeks to get there.<br />
<br />
By that time the 40 hr/week guy has moved on and made even more money...ironic how that too is similar to a hardcore raider vs a casual raider. What is amazing to me is how quickly some people have made &quot;casual&quot; synonymous with &quot;baddy that couldn't down KT unless he was carried&quot;...and yet those same people are concerned that these &quot;casuals&quot; will some day muster up the skill to even TRY to complete these achievements. Gear will only get you so far. On numerous occasions I was locked to fail Kara pugs full of people in SWP/BT quality badge gear. If your only limitation is time...then yes these changes mean &quot;casuals&quot; will get these drakes. Baddies wearing t9 badge gear will still fail at completing the more difficult achievements. T8 automatically upgrades your DPS to 5k, even if you were pulling 1k in naxx amirite?<br />
<br />
I personally did not have much invested either way, because I only get to raid 1 night a week at this stage in my life. But even this change will open up the drakes to maybe 10-15% of the raiding population. The general population the numbers will be even lower considering many people don't even bother with raiding because it is not enjoyable to them. By the time the numbers have risen that high, you will already have your new status symbol mount from the next raid to prove how much bigger your e-peen is then the guilds that just now earned their protos from Ulduar.</div></div><hr />

Thirdly, I will commend you on a pretty good Player X / Player Y exercise :) You have made it easier for everyone (and me!) to understand the logic that you are using to justify why you do not yet have a drake.<br />
<br />
Raid boss A is a hard boss. He takes a focused and dedicated group to take down.<br />
Player X and his 10 man raid have decided that they are going to spend the whole raid session (4 hours) to down Raid boss A so that they can get one step closer to the drake. They have all made peace with the fact that they may not have time to kill all the bosses in Ulduar, but have also agreed that Progression &gt; loot for some. <br />
Player X and his 10 man raid are unsuccessful in completing the hardmode, but agree to keep Raid boss A alive.<br />
Player X and his 10 man raid come back and because it is their last raid night they spend ½ the night doing the hardmode and if unsuccessful do him normal mode and try to salvage the rest of the instance. After an unsuccessful whopping 8 hours that week, Player X calls the raid.<br />
Player X does this for all hard modes<br />
<br />
Player Y has a life, so he cannot play 8 hours a week, apparently.<br />
Player Y puts together a 10 man raid group to take down Raid boss A. <br />
Player Y believes that there is no way that he will be able to get the meta achievement because he believes he does not have the time to dedicate to it, but he’s willing to try his best. After a respectable 2 hours wiping on the hardmode, Player Y decides to maximize his time online and scrap the hardmode idea to gear out his raid (we cannot put full blame on him, because there is always the possibility of his other 9 raid members crying about loot).<br />
Player Y completes all the bosses in ulduar (even Yogg), and declares that they will down Raid boss A “for real” next week.<br />
<br />
I think you mentioned something about time.<br />
Player X raided a little longer than Player Y (maybe 2 hours more, that week), but he chose to “sit through these time consuming wipes” as you put it, on Raid boss A, because he and his raid have dedicated themselves to completing a goal. He dedicated ¾ of the raid week to fine tuning the Raid boss A fight, and it now runs like clockwork.<br />
Player Y raided a little less than Player X but he feels that he does not have time to “sit through these time consuming wipes”, so he maximizes his time by clearing every boss in the instance (hopefully) and therefore never improves his SKILL in the fight. <br />
I’m not saying all casuals do this, I’m saying YOU do this, because you said so yourself. <br />
You and I may be “just as skilled at playing the game, because there[we‘re] both intelligent people” and we “both understand the game and its mechanics.” But when it comes to execution of said mechanics, you will not run the storm clouds to the casters, nor will you frost nova the saplings, because you have not been TRAINED to do that. <br />
You are using &quot;Time&quot; as an excuse. Be a man and admit that you don’t have the will nor the drive to get the Drake. I’ll even step up and admit that maybe I was wrong. Maybe you do have skills. Just not on Ulduar hard modes.<br />
<br />
And for the record, this is not about hardcores and casuals, its about Evildorf. Because he called me a moron. And an idiot</div></div><hr />

Whe all know that Blizzard changed after the company was bought. They change the things according to where they can get more money now.<br />
<br />
But that's not what matters here, because this isn't making more or less money for them. We alread took for granted that the 3.1 mounts would be removed, so nobody should be &quot;OMGAWD they'll remove it in 3.2! Not paying for this crap anymore!&quot;.<br />
<br />
This shows that Coliseum isn't as big (not talking about 3.2 sucking or not... yet) as Ulduar and they'll probably launch 3.2 sooner than we expected for a &quot;major content patch&quot;.<br />
<br />
And also, this change won't &quot;flood the market&quot; with 310% flying mounts... this will happen when Brewfest kicks in. And that I would say it was a sad change of mentality.<br />
<br />
As someone alread said, it is (or should be) a reward for the ones who cared about it enough to try it (REALLY care, not people who &quot;care&quot; like &quot;if it shows on my mail, of course I would get it&quot;, &quot;if it was 1600g, I would buy it&quot;, etc...) on a optional achievement system. It doesn't block from experimenting the content (achievements aren't content, hardmodes are MODES, not new content) or it's necessary for playing the game.<br />
<br />
It's simple: You care &gt; You try &gt; You beat it &gt; You win it.<br />
<br />
I'll get my Violet Drake the way it was designed, with all the pertinent original meta-achievements. Would get it with 4 of 5 characters (the DK), but got really tired after a few world events later and lost a few achievements here and there on 3 of them when decided to focus on my main character 1st.<br />
<br />
At the same time, a friend of mine will be able to get one too (probably a few days later if Blizzard doesn't change Brewfest item prices), but the problem is that he just didn't care about it. After countless &quot;hahaha, you're wasting time on this achievement crap? Common...&quot; , &quot;lol, achievement is for loosers&quot;, etc... he realised that the &quot;gay protodrake&quot; was actually a very good reward for the effort and started checking what he needed to grab it too... <br />
<br />
ops... a little bit too late... brew of the year... he didn't care about that... well, there is always next year, but... he decided to QQ about that everytime... and just like him, tons of &quot;hahaha, achievements are for loosers&quot; also QQ a lot... Blizzard tried to not accept that, but looks like it represented a real problem for they finances OR the new dev team didn't understand what was happening and &quot;fixed&quot; the problem.<br />
<br />
Fair? Nope. Same as the Glory of the Raider Mount problem? A little, but worse.<br />
<br />
&quot;Ah, you elitist jerk!&quot; Nope, not even close. Remember, not only achievements were designed as optional, they're also not the same. The world event one was designed as a &quot;effort over time/long time&quot; achievement and you'll get a good reward for it, not just &quot;points&quot;.<br />
<br />
The same for the Glory of the Raid ones... worth the try as it's not a gear that will get obsolet in a few months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I would be bitter about this too, if somebody so obviously doesn't care and still gets the drake. Also Blizzard could have been a bit smarter and left the Brew of the year out of the meta in the first place. Claiming it stays in, then backing out makes them look stupid.<br />
<br />
To me the basic problem of this meta was that it was included BEFORE achievements were in the game. So...have a 12 month event that starts with Hallow Ends or whatever, give everyone the same starting base when the achievement system is introduced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Worker X and Worker Y both work. Worker X works a lot. Worker Y works a little.<br />
<br />
Both Workers are just as skilled at working, because they are intelligent people. They both understand the job they need to do.<br />
<br />
Now lets look at their working.<br />
<br />
Job A is a hard job. Job A takes many weeks to complete. Worker X has all the time to work on this job, while Worker Y does not, because he has a life.<br />
<br />
You seem to not know the difference between a BAD worker, and workers who can spend different ammounts of time working.<br />
You get BAD workers who work a lot, and BAD workers who work a little.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a question for you. <br />
Does someone who can work less get paid as much as someone who can work more?<br />
<br />
NO.<br />
NO.<br />
NO.<br />
NO.<br />
<br />
Did I say no? no?<br />
<br />
NO.<br />
<br />
<br />
At equal skill at work or gaming:<br />
People who don't work as much as others don't deserve as much reward as those that work more.<br />
People who don't play as much as others don't deserve as much reward as those that play more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Deserve? Enter Person Z who happens to have inherited the factory where X and Y work. Person Z is a slacker an idiot, yet can drive a Ferrari and spend all year at the Cote d'Azur because he inherrited the factory from his father. Maybe worker Y is actually better at internal job politics and slimes his way up. Maybe worker T is even lazier than the both but sleeps with the boss?<br />
<br />
Don't pretend RL is fair. It is a stupid example and fails like comparing a job to a game in the first place.</div></div><hr />

OHHHH :D I understand now<br />

Person Z is the Raid Leader's IRL friend so he always gets to come to raid (and be carried), worker Y is that guy that everyone likes because he is positive, funny and always has 100 fish feasts, and worker T is the brown-noser who is tight with the GM because they grind BG's together every friday?<br />

<br />
I don't think this is that big of a deal, because, be honest with yourself how many people are going to stay in Ulduar and put in the time necessary to get these achievements when there's new content out that is also beatable and provides better gear? And I'm talking about the Ironbound, not the rusted, because if you've gotten the rusted using 25 man Uldar gear you've already lost the right to make that argument. <br />
<br />
I think I can describe this better by describing how I've played. I consider myself a reasonably good player, I know my gear and my class and I pretty rarely die to screw ups. <br />
<br />
The guild I'm in is ok, not great. We have some good people and some that are mediocre. We've called ourselves a &quot;casual raiding guild&quot; in the past. I'll describe further to explain what I mean. <br />
<br />
Right now I'm studying for the bar exam. I haven't touched wow in three weeks. (which is probably why I check mmo so often) I'm reasonably sure that when I come back I'll still have a raiding spot, but my job after the exam may keep me late on any number of days. <br />
<br />
I generally try to make our 25 man raids, but I haven't gotten much 10 man progression in because setting aside three evenings a week was a lot already, setting aside another two for serious attempts at 10 man progression is something I couldn't commit to. <br />
<br />
The rest of my guild is like that too. Nearly all are older and nearly all have careers, most have kids too. We try to raid three days a week, and we genuinely try for progression. We have an afk post policy, but on any given raiding day several people are going to be absent because something came up with the kids, or they had to stay late at work. So we fill the raid with whoever we can, and the result is quality varies. Some nights we are awesome, others we spend half the night wiping to easily avoided mistakes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone who considers yourself &quot;hardcore&quot; would your guild tolerate raiders who can't guarantee presence on any given scheduled night with only a few hours notice because something might come up with the kids or at work? Some other guilds I'm familiar with certainly wouldn't have. But our is, because we all know and accept that Real Life Comes first. <br />
<br />
That's what being a casual means.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. If you have the skill to &quot;get out of the fire&quot;, then you should be able to get the Drakes with or without the 245 gear and all this change is giving you is more time.<br />
<br />
2. I'd like to re-emphasize that all you're getting is more time because even if you kill the first Coliseum boss on the day that 3.2 is released, all you got was 2-3 pieces of loot and you're done. That's not enough to drastically swing the gear level of your overall raid.<br />
<br />
Even if you farmed the hell out of heroics, you may get one Emblem of Triumph piece before the first raid week ends. Again, not enough to shift the odds overwhelmingly in your favor. If you're good enough to get the mounts now, you don't need the gear. It'll make it easier, but you won't need it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Incarnia</div><div class="date">2009-07-25, 09:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest... I don't exactly care insanely much about this.. <br />
By now all those who entered vanilla and stayed until now are pretty used to things getting nerfed in a rapid schedule or whatever Blizzard now may pull off.<br />
<br />
However... When reading here people seem to misunderstand exactly what Hardcore means at the moment. <br />
<br />
25 man<br />
<br />
Hardcore = a guild who can clear Ulduar &quot;easy mode&quot; in 1 night, lets say 5 hours tops. Including all hardmodes 2 nights, maybe 2½-3 nights 5:ish hours each day, depending on how people decided to play and if good setups are available (talking Freya 3E and Mimiron mostly, 1 Light is fairly hard but easier by a lot compared to Freya and mimi).<br />
But also a guild who when new content/PTR testing is available raids 5-6 nights /week, if not more in it's extreme cases .. Ulduar clear first week on live was rather LOL though.. HM's a completely different story.. <br />
<br />
A hardcore player is someone who cares a great deal about learning their class and play it flawlessly, now a lot of casuals might do that as well but are either hindered to move on further in pursuing to find a Hardcore guild or just doesn't find that aspect important by whatever reasons.. <br />
A hardcore wants a better than average guild, wants to be good at playing their class and knowing their roll at bosses, is often a competitive player who likes to compare him/her-self vs others.. Doesn't mind to prio the game over irl stuff on occasions.<br />
<br />
Casual = Someone who can't play much during evenings/play much at all or simply wont (got better things to do, sadly a lot of those tend to believe they should get EVERYTHING within the game just because they pay the same monthly fee as everyone else).. <br />
<br />
OR a guild who often got a quite large player base within the guild but don't really have enough Core players to bring consistency to the raid when it really matters.. Usually calls themselves semi-hardcore because they have to raid 4-5 times a week, are able to do some of the easier HM's in Ulduar while working on a meta or two.. Often without much success because the lack of core players, got people who slacks off, players unable to stay focused or simply don't know their class well enough or the boss encounter. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So honestly if you only measure time spent each week in raids the black and white picture of the Hardcore vs Casual is blurred out.. Hardcore vs Casual is more a mind set of the player, what their goals are with their playing. Not necessary a &quot;thing&quot; where how much time you have on your hands decides how &quot;much&quot; you can play. <br />
<br />
Personally as a hardcore player I got a lot of time off from raids where I can do other stuff, IRL stuff.. Whatever I chose to really.. Though when it is required I am able to spend a lot of time in the game to progress.<br />
But then I don't really care about lvling alts, idle in Dala or mindlessly spend time inside the game.. I like to be effective and productive and not burn myself out.<br />
<br />
<br />
But fine.. have your drakes.. I'll still have my black proto drake if I ever feel the need to show off a e-peen of some kind at krasus landing.. <br />
Though.. I think it is a little sad that the hardcore player barely have anything atm that distinguish themselves from the &quot;masses&quot;.. it's really not what it used to be (miss the old times).</div></div><hr />

The people who are annoyed at this change are the people who feel that thier hard work will be considered lesser down the road. Only skilled raiders should have the drake. I agree. My question is simply this.<br />
<br />
Should then skilled raiders once upon a time have something over everyone else forever later down the road, no matter how crappy they become, just because they got there first?<br />
Not to me, no.<br />
<br />
The only difference about this is now no one will give a crap if you have this item later on down the road. But if new drakes are constantly being released, and you're obtaining them for bragging rights, then you need to continue raiding with skill instead of just doing it once. People who are whining because &quot;Now my drake is being given to lesser raiders.&quot; I reply simply &quot;Then work for the new one. Goodluck.&quot;<br />
<br />
Would it be cool if once people hit level 30, it was then harder, if not impossible for others to do so later down the road simply because they &quot;weren't dedicated enough&quot;? How about if entire zones were removed because now they're too easy to complete? Not so easy to say this change is bad when you compare it that way, is it?<br />
<br />
Honestly. It's the same thing I hear about loot being easier to obtain. All I keep hearing is &quot;QQ, now they'll have it.&quot; Because it's not enough that you have all the current gear, the next level of gear first, now you need the NEXT level of gear as well? Seriously, if you're going to be a pioneer, BE ONE. Do you think Lewis and Clark said later on, &quot;Aw, now it's easier for everyone else to be on these lands.&quot;? God no. They said, &quot;Where's our next adventure?&quot;<br />
<br />
Stop being so eager to have gold stars showing how much of a better player you are than everyone else. Prove it by getting there before it's easy, and continuing onward as new roads appear.</div></div><hr />

what even makes you think that casuals are skilled equally to hardcores? no fucking way man<br />
casuals may be skilled but they are defintly wayyyyy tooo under skilled when u compare them <br />
to a hardcore raider,<br />
you are comparing the ppl who die to rockets on mimiron, shockwave on emalon, and other easy stufff<br />
to people who got their ulduar drakes?<br />
<br />
im definitly against this change by blizzard....310% speed mounts shud be as rare as possible<br />
whats the fuckin point when every 1 on the realm is on 310% speed mounts? ppl are saying that <br />
even if the drake is gettable but casuals will take too long to get it? BUT WHY DO THEY EVEN NEED TO GET IT?<br />
they dont need it..infact they dont even deserve it...i mean come on<br />
there is a lot of content in game for casual raiders,<br />
<br />
if blizz is so helpful to casuals....why dont give away glad titles?<br />
and vendor 310% speed mounts so that they can purchase it without having to use any brains.<br />
and yeah...give away frostwyrms too for them<br />
<br />
lol ur an idiot i quit raiding cos i was sick of the elitist attitude so now im casual yeh? i was much more skilled then a lot of the healers in my guild so that shows that just cos im casual now doesnt mean im shit. now stop trolling the forums and go QQ with the other retards</div></div><hr />

How much time you have to play World of Warcraft does not determine skill, in any way whatsoever. Many so-called &quot;hardcores&quot; are so quick to dismiss or abuse casuals, and are ignorant to the fact that many of these people are highly skilled, intelligent players, and in many cases are better at what they do than some of these &quot;hardcores&quot;.<br />
<br />
The casual player can be anyone. Might be someone who works six days a week. Might be someone with kids to feed and nappies to change. It doesn't make them any less at WoW. Rewards are there for proven skill, and whether you have enough time to complete the achievements in 6 weeks or 12 weeks doesn't make you any less deserving right there. Not everyone has the freedom or security to be able to play a game for endless hours and rush through content. And those who aren't able, or simply choose not to, rush their way through said content shouldn't be at a disadvantage. Its not a race.<br />
<br />
Some people play WoW to get these cool and shiny things first and others play simply to enjoy the game and the rewards it gives. Its not about being quicker at clearing content or even being &quot;better&quot; than other players. In reality, there are some players do are able to devote more time and energy to the game, and other players who have more important real-life things to attend to. At the end of the day, its a game, and why you play it doesn't automatically make you better than another player.If you're playing World of Warcraft to get attention for yourself or to make up for some personality and social shortcomings IRL, then perhaps you're playing for the wrong reasons.</div></div><hr />

whats the fuckin point when every 1 on the realm is on 310% speed mounts?&quot;<br />
<br />
If they should be &quot;as rare as possible&quot; maybe they should change it where you do all the hardmodes and then only ONE mount drops from the final boss so only ONE raider gets it each week, ala the Ashes of Alar?. Of course Im sure you're gonna piss and moan that this would be wrong because &quot;you earned&quot; your right to have one. <br />
All this fuss raised over a game that has gotten progressively easier for everyone over the years and where raiding really lost its relevance before WOTLK. Guilds succeed now, not based on skill but based on how many warm bodies they can have show up and swap in and out of raids to down encounters. I've seen too many &quot;top&quot; guilds basically zerging encounters and stacking the raid to suit their purposes, not having people work to the best of their abilities. Not saying this isnt a smart manipulation of raiding, just saying that it goes against the grain of being a &quot;good&quot; player . <br />
I grouped with 5 of the &quot;hardcore&quot; players from another guild on this server to do 10 man vault last week. Wiped on the first attempt and they started ranting about how the group sucked and we didnt know what we were doing and we should leave wow and then proceeded to leave the group. We filled with 5 random puggers (because really, how hard IS vault in the first place...) and downed him in record time for us. Those 5 &quot;hardcore&quot; players all had their naxx mounts as well. So much for hardcore players having skill I guess.</div></div><hr />

NOT! wtf i had to progress through every hardmode wearing ilevel 226 gear only.. that means less stam, (the most under rated stat in the game), less dps, less mana. now noobs can just stroll in with ilevel 245 gear and one shot every &quot;hard&quot; mode. you suck blizzard! i thought my ironbound was gonna be rare... i thought wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are hereby forewarned that there will be more and more content that is made accessible to players who are not the &quot;realm first&quot; overachievers, along with some gifts for participation.<br />
<br />
If you strive for those realm firsts for the joy and the triumph of doing it, you probably have your head on relatively straight.<br />
<br />
However, if you participate in those exclusive things merely to feel smug and arrogant as you prance around with some incredibly rare achievement item, know that it will only last a short while before others may obtain it with less effort.<br />
<br />
If you have a problem with that, then you may want to leave the game now.</div></div><hr />
