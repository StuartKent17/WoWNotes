Extra Champion's Seals in 3.1.2<br />
Small update on the Argent Tournament rewards, the Champion's Purse (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45724) now has a chance to drop a Champion's Seal (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44990). It will probably help you get your Argent Hippogryph (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzyHw7bt37k) faster, especially with the lowered price (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17163477135-argent-hippogryph-cost-update.html).<br />

Nitro Boots Shut Down in Arena<br />
After several attempts to balance the Nitro Boots ability in the arena, we have decided that we currently do not have an acceptable solution. Until we are able to better balance this ability it has been shut down in the arenas. We fully plan to continue working on this item and we intend to adjust it in upcoming patches. <br />
<br />
We have plans to make certain that this item is still worth the investment made in it. So don't vendor it just yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/15/17223045345-nitro-boots-shut-down-in-arena.html))<br />

Buffs to Fury and Arms<br />
We do have buffs planned for Arms and Fury. We'll announce them when they are a little closer to going live. I don't want to oversell them because players sometimes get notions of seeing their dps go up by 25%.<br />
<br />
It's also entirely possible dps buffs might come with PvP nerfs. Warrior representation in Arena went from very low to very high. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223174426-fury-a-simple-fix.html))<br />
<br />
Arms and Fury in PvE/PVP<br />
I should have found the original quote, but someone above thought that I was saying we needed to nerf Fury for PvP. We're not worried that Fury is overpowered in PvP. We are worried that Arms might be overpowered in PvP.<br />
<br />
Arms PvE -- dps too low<br />
Fury PvE -- dps too low<br />
Arms PvP -- possibly too good (but we'll see how 3.1.2 goes)<br />
Fury PvP -- not concerned about it being too good (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223174426-fury-a-simple-fix.html))</div></div><hr />

Engineering has been dead for PvE since WotLK, <br />
Now, they just finished the job and killed it for PvP as well.<br />

Blizzard doesn't want us to use the profession other than for low level twinks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
unspoken addition:<br />
we want to have warrior representation at very low again so we nerf them after they were balanced and leave the op faceroller melees muti-rogue/unholy dk/lolret at the state they are<br />

What are you talking about? You have any problems with TG warriors in pvp? I sure don't. It's the bladestorming bastards that need the nerfs.</div></div><hr />

Considering how often they nerf Fury Warriors, then buff them, then nerf them, then buff them, then nerf them again, and are about to buff them AGAIN, I think they don't have a clue what they're doing.<br />

If you read the source, the QQer asks for a vendor to &quot;vendor&quot; engineering. The blue post is saying that the profession would still be worth it and to not &quot;vendor&quot; it yet.</div></div><hr />

Ok now to talk about warriors, First we're not Overpowered, people just hate the warrior class and hate it when they actually become viable in PvP, See before 3.1 A warrior was just a free kill most classes just stood there while a warrior hit them cause warriors just couldnt do anything. Then juggernaut came and made us PvP viable again YAY!, oh wait im actually killing people in arenas and BGs now:*( that means a nerf is coming. Yep its true as soon as warriors start killing people in PvP we are all of a sudden &quot;Overpowered&quot; peoples views on what warriors should be is obsurd, &quot;warriors should be able to be kited around&quot;, &quot;warriors should be free kills&quot; come on, enough of the QQ, L2 adapt. I mean seriously Blizz needs to look into the class that are actually OP, OK I have 840 resilience and I was hammer of justiced by a ret pallie then was 3 shotted didnt stand a chance, I could never do that to a player who has 840 resilience, it just wouldnt happened, oh and I happen to get matched up against the same ret paladin, who I disarmed this time around and he still hit me for 6k with a judgement while I have 840 resilience.<br />
<br />
But anyway there are classes out there that are much more of a problem than warriors but everyone QQ's about warriors because everyone knows Blizz will nerf us ASAP, for me ret paladins are OP for someone else they may think that DK's are OP but the bottomline is that warriors have become a threat to people in PvP which we should be, unlike before being just a free kill 99% of the time, also just to put this out there LOREWISE we are supposed to be masters of melee, masters of all weapons and we are masters of battle. we are the first ones in line to take a beating but we are also supposed to be dominate at what we do when before 3.1 again we were a free kill 99% of the time, now we have become a threat just like DK's, Pallies, Rogues, and so forth.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cru23</div><div class="date">2009-05-21, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">About warriors...<br />
<br />
what they should do to make warriors balanced is this:<br />
Replace Wrecking crew with Enrage.<br />
it will make the fury dps incrase and nerf warriors in arms.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bons</div><div class="date">2009-05-21, 05:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">PVP PVE maybe it's time to give the warrior some skills &quot;do not work on other plays&quot; whenever the buffer pve. pvp get overpowert. so we nerfer and then the warriors cant keep up in PVE <br />
<br />
so looking forward to what Blizzard well come up with.<br />
