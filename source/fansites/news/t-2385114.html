Weekly Bonus Event - Arena Skirmishes<br />
Sharpen your swords and reinforce your boards, because you’re called to the PvP Arena for the hectic mayhem of Skirmishes.<br />
<br />
This Week: Arena Skirmishes<br />
All week, from anywhere in Azeroth, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i), select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window, and then under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3 and JOIN BATTLE. You’ll be matched up with teammates and provided with opponents to kill in the Arena.<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Timear (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/44172-the-arena-calls) for you.<br />
<br />
Quest requirement: Win 10 Arena PvP Skirmishes<br />
Reward: A PvP loot box <br />
<br />
Passive buff: +50% honor gains from Skirmishes<br />
<br />
<br />
If you’ve been looking to make some Honor gains, this is the week to do it!<br />
<br />
<br />
Jump into PvP Brawls: Deep Six<br />
Who has your six in this six vs. six brawl? Deep Six will put you and your group to the test.<br />
<br />
Every other week, a new PvP Brawl will be available to players looking for something just a little different. Each Brawl will offer a variety of modes, rules, and scenic changes to the usual Battleground gameplay, and you’ll find them in the Group Finder tool (hotkey “I”) in the Player vs. Player tab. Just like Random Battlegrounds, you’ll receive a reward for achieving victory.<br />
<br />
Deep Six pits teams of six players against each other in three iconic Battlegrounds: Warsong Gulch, Silvershard Mines, and Temple of Kotmogu. Each Battleground offers a little variation on the traditional format, such as flags that are a bit closer in Warsong Gulch, less carts to keep track of in Silvershard Mines, and only two orbs within the Temple of Kotmogu.</div></div><hr />

Nah this probably means we're at the half-way point or beyond between Antorus release and BfA release.</div></div><hr />

Hellfire Citadel had cross realm enabled on mythic via 6.2.3 which was 17th November 2015 and next expansion was launched on August 2016... Nothing new here.</div></div><hr />

Huh? We know that BfA have similar schedule like Legion. Antorus is up 4 months, 4 months from now is late July - it wouldn't be strange to have pre-patch late July. Even if you count full release it's just 1-2 month difference.</div></div><hr />

Meh. Necrotic is only really annoying on teeming or tyrannical weeks. Otherwise it's fine, just need a tank who isn't an idiot and DPS who know when to stun/slow.</div></div><hr />

The tech is already there for cross realm mythic raiding. It's just a switch.<br />
<br />
Why that switch isn't always on I have no idea. It's just a stick to beat people on small realms with.</div></div><hr />

I believe main reason for Mythic still locked to 1 server = money from character transfers.<br />
<br />
Otherwise there would be basicly no reason to transfer character anymore :-)</div></div><hr />

Not at all, it is guild achievement. So guild could still earn this achievement, even if players doing Mythic raid would be from different servers, guild woud just not earn it, unless most of the players would be from the same guild.</div></div><hr />
