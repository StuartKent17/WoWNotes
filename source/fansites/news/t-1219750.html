I wouldnt say that. Renewing mists lost a bit of its kick but it ticks every 2 seconds instead of 3. And the haste thing, as far as I know, is non existant on live meaning that 50% increased haste from stats is still a complete buff to them.</div></div><hr />

Whining for what exactly? Pyro cd was going to impact PvE alter timing with PoM + pyro proc by a massive amount, consume pyroblast!, wait 2.3 seconds, consume PoM, you cant get inferno blast then 1 more pyro before alter time runs out.<br />
On other hand no 2.3k+ mages play fire anyway, so /care.</div></div><hr />

Renewing Mists jumps one less time, yes, but it tics 50% faster. <br />
<br />
The haste bonus on Stance of the Wise Serpent does not exist on live. Chances are 150% was a typo from a previous beta build. That's still a buff, either way. It doesn't exist on live, so when it hits live, MWs get 50% more haste from their gear.<br />
<br />
Their mana costs were bumped up a bit, but not enough to matter.<br />

<br />
They often add tweaked things for later world events in random patches much before they come out. <br />
<br />
Blizz has put a huge emphasis on putting out content faster, and 5.1 contains zero raid content so theres no reason to stagger its release to preserve the current tier of content. I'd expect 5.1 to be out in a matter of weeks (3-4) not 3 months lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are fairly strong in AOE healing but extremely weak on single target. They also have massive mana issues. These nerfs basically hit them where they are weak, which means that pretty much every MW is going to be forced to spam SCK for Chi just to pop Mana Tea enough to heal anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Their mana costs were bumped up a bit, but not enough to matter.<br />
<br />
And Healing Spheres... no one used them anyway.<br />
<br />
of course it is a nerf. it heals for the same amount, just every 2 seconds, but on one target less = 25% less healing from ReM. now you will heal 25% less targets with uplift, what means 25% less. Now note that those 2 spells are 60-70% of the total healing of a MW in any heavy damage encounter. the other significant amount is from the mw mastery, which is cut to half.<br />
<br />
So summing up, it will be around a 20% nerf to our AoE healing, what might even be OK, compared to other healers. The problem is that they even nerf single target healing, increasing the mana cost of Surging mists and soothing mists.<br />
<br />
the haste buff will mean almost nothing to our aoe healing, while being another hit to our single target efficiency.<br />
<br />
MW has no working smart heals (chi wave is slow and buggy as hell, ReM is slow also not making it reliable as a group or smart heal)<br />
MW has no working group heals<br />
MW has no efficient single target heal<br />
MW has no working single target CD<br />
MW can only do what they are doing right now, spamming aoe like crazy coz is the only thing they can do, when all the encounters are designed to be a fucking AoE fest when it comes to healing.<br />
<br />
I would welcome the aoe nerf if compensated with some single target useful tools :/</div></div><hr />

Because a game did something wrong in the past, doesn't mean it has to keep doing it in the future. I'm sorry if you enjoy grinding, but as can be proven by flops of recent games that tried to put everything behind a grind, most current gamers do not enjoy that sort of gameplay, and WoW should keep away from it (as virtually every game - just leave a couple for people who do enjoy it).</div></div><hr />

Wow = a grinding game. Grinding is NOT something that is &quot;outdated&quot;. It's something many people actually enjoy doing and would rather do that then something else.<br />
<br />
Look at the Koreans and Japanese for example, their most popular games have so much grind in them WoW's a joke compared to them.<br />
Exactly like you said, WoW is a joke compares to those korean games such as Maplestory because it's not meant to be a grinding game in the first place. <br />
<br />
Wow classic was a very poor design, which the game was moving away from different direction. WoW is all about end game and end game is not equal to grinding. <br />
<br />
If I want to play grinding game then I'd go back to play Maplestory, pure grinding, nothing else, just grind grind grind but they don't add dailys to their grinds.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing inherently grindy in the concept of a game which is available to large masses to play in the single online world with a roleplaying game style.<br />
<br />
That may be true but every major mmo release to date has had some grindy concept implemented into it whether it be questing or not.<br />

Holy MW nerfs... seems like it was a little much. Guess I'll find out soon enough.<br />
<br />
Blizz is looking to nerf all healing for hybrid dps across the board, was mentioned in a blue post recently.</div></div><hr />

Doing a quest once is not grinding. Having to do it twenty times over, with quest text saying (literally) just &quot;there's this dude you need to kill, again&quot; is one, however, and is an element modern games are slowly purging. Blizzard should really get a hint about that by now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because a game did something wrong in the past, doesn't mean it has to keep doing it in the future. I'm sorry if you enjoy grinding, but as can be proven by flops of recent games that tried to put everything behind a grind, most current gamers do not enjoy that sort of gameplay, and WoW should keep away from it (as virtually every game - just leave a couple for people who do enjoy it).<br />
<br />
So you want games to just give you stuff? What is the fun in that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The sooner they separate PVP and PVE skills the better, may take time but i can't see it being overly hard to make each skill scale differently in PVP, hell they already do it with CC length.</div></div><hr />

I LIKE DAILYS SO MUCH THAT I AM GONNA DO ALOT BUT I WANT TO FORCE OTHER PEOPLE TO DO WHAT THEY HATE.<br />
<br />
Nobody was asking for &quot;free epix&quot;. I don't know where have you been but if you look at hundred of topics and people actually gave solutions and constructive feedback.<br />
<br />
If you like dailys that's cool, but people want different methods of getting reps such as tabard to run dungeons and give it cap on how much reps you can get each day.<br />
<br />
But, judging on your comment feels like pouring water down to the sewer.</div></div><hr />

Why would you force people to do dailies? <br />
If you read his comment you can clearly see that he doesnt want to work for his stuff, he just want them. Hundreds of topics ha? *cough* 10 million subscribers *cough*<br />
I dont like dailies, unless i am in a group with friends and on skype. (If it isnt fun you have to make it fun).<br />
Why is that?</div></div><hr />

Not sure if you've been watching, but WoW PvP streams bring in the vast majority of the total WoW viewers. Obviously not a standard to measure by, but WoW PvP is huge. Treating it like a burden is really ignorant, as it's likely to be a primary reason for just as many subscribers as hardcore raiding is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also having Renewing mist ticking every 2nd second will give them abit more tank healing, which is another thing that's good for 10man raiding.</div></div><hr />

Why is that?<br />
Not all of those 10 million players are U.S sub. And, hundred of topics is alot of forum goers.<br />
Blizzard refuse to give second option on reps grinding because they know if they do, people will not do dailys. <br />
Dailys are boring and it is a simple fact that majortiy hates them.<br />
In before &quot;HOW DO YOU KNOW PEOPLE HATE DAILYs&quot;. Read second sentence.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc4f7a735ed2</div><div class="date">2012-11-02, 11:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">of course it is a nerf. it heals for the same amount, just every 2 seconds, but on one target less = 25% less healing from ReM. now you will heal 25% less targets with uplift, what means 25% less. Now note that those 2 spells are 60-70% of the total healing of a MW in any heavy damage encounter. the other significant amount is from the mw mastery, which is cut to half.<br />
<br />
So summing up, it will be around a 20% nerf to our AoE healing, what might even be OK, compared to other healers. The problem is that they even nerf single target healing, increasing the mana cost of Surging mists and soothing mists.<br />
<br />
the haste buff will mean almost nothing to our aoe healing, while being another hit to our single target efficiency.<br />
<br />
MW has no working smart heals (chi wave is slow and buggy as hell, ReM is slow also not making it reliable as a group or smart heal)<br />
MW has no working group heals<br />
MW has no efficient single target heal<br />
MW has no working single target CD<br />
MW can only do what they are doing right now, spamming aoe like crazy coz is the only thing they can do, when all the encounters are designed to be a fucking AoE fest when it comes to healing.<br />
<br />
I would welcome the aoe nerf if compensated with some single target useful tools :/<br />
<br />
Just pointing out that soothing mists mana cost has been reduced, not increased. On live it's 1% of base mana, it got reduced to 0.66667% in a previous ptr build, and now it's been put to 0.726%, so still more than a 25% mana cost reduction compared to live: it's a freaking buff.<br />
But I guess it's more fun to just look at this build's nerfs without taking into account the previous buffs.</div></div><hr />

In Blizzard's eye &quot;Rogues are fine&quot;... Nothing we can do about it unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

Hope there will be something in near future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogues – We think that Rogue damage in PvP is appropriate—the damage that some other classes are dealing is too high, and we want to adjust those cases before we do any tinkering elsewhere. We still like the Rogue suite of tools and abilities, but we feel like some of these mechanics might have been eclipsed by newer, shinier versions. We are looking at improving Rogue mobility and control in conservative ways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is ridiculously far from my point. <br />
<br />
My point was that they should cause spells to react differently in PVP than they do in PVE, it has been shown they can do this (i.e reduction of CC in PVP and different scaling of damage), this change would SIGNIFICANTLY increase the quality of life of both PVE and PVPers as things can be adjusted for one side of the coin and not affect the other. <br />
<br />
BM burst is far too high in PVP but its fine for PVE? Dial it down in PVP and leave PVE the way it is. <br />
Druid Heals OP in PVP but lacking in PVE? Nerf the PVP side of it and buff it for PVE.<br />
<br />
Not saying its a quick fire solution, but it will solve a lot of issues as currently changing a spell due to problems in one side (PVP/PVE) has knock on effects to the other side, which we seem to be seeing more of this expansion for some reason (I.e BM being way too OP in PVP but being in a decent place in PVE, but will now likely be underpowered in PVE due to a change made for PVP purposes).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right, I missed that one. But anyway, they could remove the mana cost entirely and the spell still would be unreliable as a chi generator, which is what monks miss more when coming to tank healing.</div></div><hr />

Windwalker Monks were healing for a lot in PvP. They could heal for nearly half their health in a matter of 2 secs with just a single Chi Wave while in melee range. I don't know why Chi Burst was nerfed though.</div></div><hr />
