Blackhand's Demolition (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/156425-demolition) ability now deals 20% less damage and his Massive Demolition (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/156479-massive-demolition) ability now deals 5% less damage on Normal, Heroic, and Mythic difficulties.<br />

Patch 6.2 - PvP Trinket Cooldown Reduction<br />
We're currently planning to change the on-use PvP trinkets back to a 1-minute cooldown (and reducing their effects) in patch 6.2. This is effectively reverting the change made to these trinkets in patch 6.1, which was a heavy contributor to the overall strength of the Human racial.<br />
<br />
This essentially buffs sub rogues in addition to the buffs they are receiving, along with BM hunters who will now just run 1 on use and 1 proc again.<br />
It does mean that classes with burst abilities on shorter cooldowns will be able to line them up with trinkets more regularly, yes. However, it substantially lowers the maximum potential for that burst of damage. We expect it will be significantly easier to survive through the maximum burst output of e.g. a Beast Mastery Hunter or Combat Rogue who is able to run with double trinkets. That was the case prior to the change in Patch 6.1 that changed them to their current 2-minute versions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2 Preview - Bonus Events and Adventure Guide<br />
Blizzard posted a list of the bonus events from last week's PTR build (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4865-Patch-6-2-PTR-Build-19953-April-28th-Hotfixes-Upcoming-Raid-Testing-Blue-Posts). It looks like many of the rewards have been changed since then.<br />
As development continues on Patch 6.2, we’re excited to share some additional information on two new upcoming features—Bonus Events and the new Adventure Guide.<br />
<br />
Bonus Events<br />
The Bonus Events system consists of a rotating schedule of seven different activities, currently scheduled to run from Friday through Monday of each week. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a noteworthy reward for accomplishing a related goal. The in-game calendar (located in the upper right-hand corner of the mini-map) can serve as your one-stop reference for the event schedule. The Adventure Guide—discussed in detail below—will also offer a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any associated quests.<br />
<br />
Timewalking—The Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King<br />
The schedule will feature two different Timewalking Bonus Events, each themed around an expansion: The Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King. Your character’s level and gear scales down to the dungeon at Heroic difficulty, but the loot you receive is scaled back up, making it a great way to gear up characters as well as receive cool items for transmogrification. Completing three Timewalking dungeons as a part of a quest during the event awards a Seal for an extra bonus roll, which isn’t counted toward the weekly cap of three seals. Learn more about the Timewalking Bonus Event in our Patch 6.2 Preview – Timewalking (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/18710308/).<br />
<br />
Draenor Dungeons<br />
While this Bonus Event is active, defeating enemies in any Draenor dungeon will award reputation with an appropriate faction. Completing two Mythic-difficulty Warlords dungeons as a part of a quest during the event awards a Heroic Hellfire Citadel Raid cache.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
During the Battlegrounds Bonus Event, you’ll earn triple Honor points from random Battlegrounds. Completing the event quest by winning a few random Battlegrounds awards 500 Conquest Points, which do not count toward the weekly Conquest cap.<br />
<br />
Arena Skirmishes<br />
You’ll earn triple Honor points from random Arena Skirmish matches during this event. A quest to win several random Arena Skirmish matches will award 500 Conquest Points, which do not count toward the weekly Conquest cap.<br />
<br />
Apexis<br />
If you’re trying to stock up on Apexis Crystals, you’ll be able to gain triple the amount from eligible creatures during this Bonus Event. Completing three area assault objectives during the event awards a sizable amount of Oil to fuel new Naval Missions as a part of your Shipyard. (More information on this new resource will be covered in a future Shipyards and Naval Missions preview.)<br />
<br />
Pet Battles<br />
During Pet Battle Bonus Events, you’ll be able to take your pets out for a little exercise and earn triple pet experience from battles. Winning five PvP Pet Battles as a part of a quest during the event awards the player with an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone that instantly levels a pet to 25.<br />
<br />
Adventure Guide<br />
Patch 6.2 also introduces the Adventure Guide, which acts as a landing page of sorts for our other in-game Journals, and makes it easier than ever to find content and activities that are relevant to your character.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-adp&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/thumb/ajourn01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/ajourn01.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/thumb/ajourn02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/ajourn02.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
The Adventure Guide suggests content based on a number of factors, such as character level, item level, quest progress, achievements, and more. The Guide is fully interactive, allowing players to accept relevant quests or search for a group via Group Finder with a single click.<br />
<br />
More Patch 6.2 Info<br />
You can help test our new Bonus Events and the Adventure Guide on the Patch 6.2 PTR. Note that availability to test this content may be limited to certain time frames.

Right now on the PTR there is one event per week, but keep in mind that it can change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's more to get more people to pvp I would assume, but a lot of people who have issue with competition like activities usually shy away from pvp all together, many of these players tend to be the reason WoW is being &quot;dumb down&quot; because they want everything given to them on easy mode instead of having to achieve it.</div></div><hr />

I'm not really getting the &quot;a rotating schedule of seven different activities&quot; thing<br />
<br />
Technically it is twice within the seven week rotation since TBC and Wrath are two different events. It would be nice if they are separated though so maybe TBC is week 1 of the cycle and Wrath is maybe week 3 or 4 so that people who really want to run them dont have to rush in a two week span then have nothing they are interested in for 5 weeks. <br />
<br />
Also, the PVP pet battle part is annoying. I do realize it is somewhat easy but replace the pvp part with maybe defeating X number of trainers since you have less of a chance of running forever just to try to get 5 wins if you dont have a good pvp team.</div></div><hr />

Yea, and you can see how that's working. Losing 1/3 of your customers in a single quarter hopefully sends blizzard a message. Notice how people have stopped complaining about not being able to fly? Oh yea, they finally gave up and quit the game, voting with their subscription. How many more people are about to leave? Quite a few from what I'm hearing. For all the players that say &quot;good riddance, we didn't want them here anyways&quot;, keep saying that and don't bitch when your favorite MMO is shut down because it isn't profitable any more, because &quot; good riddance, we didn't want that MMO anyways &quot;.</div></div><hr />

This is utter BS(if its true)...blizzard going full retard again. BG,Arenas,Apexis and pet battles are out of question for me and if you look at it from 7-week-cycle point of view I will be waiting more than month to play what I want.

<br />
To me one of the biggest problems in WoD is the rewards structure outside of raids and I think this is a step forward!<br />
<br />
The fact that the events are every 6 weeks means they can make the rewards worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

News from Future:<br />
Blizzcon2015. Dev Team says that Timewalking and weekends events are succesfull so the next exp will be a lot of it (if not all).<br />
They heard all complains about garrison so there will be a lot of grinding and daily to unlock more dailys and taht let you know what's next on lore and stuff.<br />
mythic dungeon it's a reality and will be a step before any serious raid.<br />
you will be forced to do PVP even if you don't like it, just to progress in the game.<br />
prepare your eyes to see a version of most popular casual game of the moment in blizz version</div></div><hr />

It looks like it is 2 weeks out of every 7 (one week TBC one week WotLK) I could be reading it wrong though!</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't mind getting bonuses for conquest, since I don't do much arena/bgs but I would like to get some quicker conquest while Ashran is being redesigned (yet again...) in terms of rewards. Also, the timewalker dungeons giving a free roll after doing 3? Yes please! Doing mythic dungeons on my alts give me a heroic cache? Hell yes! Doing Apexis dailies to get my mounts? Don't mind if I do. PvP pet battles? Time to winshare for some instant 25s to make 3k a pet. 3x honor? Quicker dust for me :D <br />
<br />
People always look at the negative instead of seeing how to exploit or bend the news into their benefit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SidFwuff</div><div class="date">2015-05-07, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I think the event should last the entire week as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's probably to encourage people to participate at the same time. <br />
<br />
If it's all week, you'll get people who knock it out on Tuesday night and then ignore it for the rest of the week, you'll get other people that do it over the weekend, and yet others that will poke at it in bits and pieces throughout the week etc.<br />
<br />
If they reduce it to a weekend thing, then you get more people participating at the same time. It might help with:<br />
<br />
- Shorter queues for the Timewalker instances as the people that main tanks and healers will be ensured to be doing it on their tanks and healers during peak hours<br />
- More even matchups in PvP as both the 'goods' and the 'bads', as well as the PvErs that are trying out the PvP event are thrown into the queues together.<br />
- More people out at the same time in the Apexis zones, during the Apexis farming event. More people in the same zone make it feel more alive and groups of players are likely to form.<br />
<br />
In short, it's probably the same reason they had 'Battleground weekend' events instead of 'Battleground weeklong' events.<br />
<br />
People are complaining that WoW is too single player, and the community doesn't react with eachother often enough. Like the Garrison visitors in 6.1 that encouraged people to visit other players' garrisons, I assume these narrow windows of time for the events is to encourage players to play at peak hours, increasing the frequency you'll encounter others.<br />
<br />
That's probably why the events rotate, too. One week they encourage everyone into 5 man timewalker dungeons, the next they encourage everyone into Arena skimishes, the week after they encourage everyone into 5 man mythic dungeons, then the next they encourage everyone into battlegrounds etc.<br />
<br />
If all seven events ran at the same time, you'd have the community split up: PvE players would do the 5mans while the PvP players would do the battlegrounds. By rotating the events they can encourage PvE and PvP players to play together.</div></div><hr />

I just had to reply to your comment. What and who are you to be entitled to bash a part of a game I like? PVP is just as much bread and butter to WoW as PVE. Blizzard should finally focus on making PVP more balanced and content for us PVP players. I do not care for PVE, it's stale, it's boring, there is no excitement to it. I had my fair deal of heroic (now mythic) raiding. I want balnced PVP!<br />

Also this. Instead of introducing something new and exciting, they just reuse old content again. Nothing new, nothing to make me pay for this game anymore. I will keep on passively accumulating gold from Garrisons and pay for my gametime with tokens. I will never spend a cent on this game, unless they start doing something about the sorry state of lack of content and PVP.<br />

From the way you say, we can clearly see that you didn't have any &quot;fair deal of heroic/mythic raiding&quot;. And it's also funny to see you saying that pve is stale/boring and pvp isn't with all the balance problems that lead to FOTM/same comps, and also the amount of bots/hacks, etc... lol.<br />
<br />
PvP is more like playing the same few dungeons since vanilla, with a 6month reset in gear to ... do the same thing all over (without at least the change of scenario from a new dungeon or even the story moving foward thanks to the pvp conflicts!). It's like playing Diablo 3 seasons hahahaha.</div></div><hr />

The schedule will feature two different Timewalking Bonus Events, each themed around an expansion: The Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King. Your character’s level and gear scales down to the dungeon at Heroic difficulty, but the loot you receive is scaled back up, making it a great way to gear up characters as well as receive cool items for transmogrification.<br />
<br />
Seriously? I did these dungeons for 2 years each when these were relevant content. In the end of every expansion it was unimaginable boring and annoying. Why should I do it again for next erhm how many years? 2? 4? More?<br />
<br />
Gear? Out of question. Currently I'm BRF HC geared. When 6.2 releases I'm sure my guild will gear up very fast. Or maybe Blizz plan to put 6.2 Mythic gear there?<br />
<br />
Transmog items? Why bother if I can just go and faceroll regular dungeon solo if I need something? I can even do it 5 times per hour (I heard it was bumped to 10/hour but didn't test myself) instead of (how much timewalking lockout lasts?) once a week?</div></div><hr />

I disagree. You know the time and resources it takes to make NEW dungeons cost about the same amount of time to make a raid. The raids have been amazing this expansion.

<br />
A brand new &quot;Difficulty?&quot; That people are walking right through (yes, it's still PTR, I know) aaaand that introduces ZERO new mechanics in. That you can only complete *once* per week.<br />
<br />
Yeah, they spent a lot of time working on those bad boys. /air-fap.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but they managed to pump out new dungeons before, new hubs, new raids... Sorry, but they don't get a pass on this one. We're getting literally Zero trade-off for the supposed time they're spending on things we'd normally get anyways.<br />
<br />
I don't buy into the Spin that Blizzard throws out that it takes that much time and resources to do, that it would essentially cost a raid tier. That's just their pathetic attempts to excuse their laziness.<br />
<br />
*EDIT* Theoretically, if they have THAT much larger of a crew to work on their game, which they have Claimed openly to have... then that *should* be a non-issue anyways!</div></div><hr />

They have said multiple times that dungeons aren't worth the time invested. They require enormous development time and each player's presence in that instance can be counted with one hand.<br />

And quite frankly, I agree. Five man dungeons have never been anything more than a means to an end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SWTOR has rotating events that are on a month or soon cool down between them. Gree, Rhakgouls, Bounty Brokers...and a few others. The event spawns for a week in which time you do dailies, and kill special raid bosses for rep, titles, and special items to buy.<br />
<br />
I think that if Blizz would make these events last longer, add a special rep as well as special vendors for them they might feel more unique. The only problem is that people would expect to be exaulted and have all the rewards in that one week...in SWTOR it takes a year or more of the periodic events to cap rep.</div></div><hr />

No, there are not. No MMO has PvP as enjoyable as WoW. I've tried all the MMOs that claim to be dedicated to PvP, and they suck beyond imagination.

That being said, I certainly hope the new tech and systems development is put to good use in future expansions. If they're able to ply the new tech into more content in the future, this might be all worth it, only history will tell.<br />

However, another expansion that feels like DLC, and I'm probably done with this game for good.<br />

At least one is what you would expect from a content patch.<br />

Let's just think for a moment, 5man bosses are way easier and faster to create for them. They can only take in consideration that a dungeon party has 1 tank, 1 healer, 3 dpsers. They can't take their sweet time trying to do some crazy new stuff because they can't imagine that the group have all the buffs or at least the most important ones like a raid. Or movement skills (like charges/jumps), or mind control, or many other class/spec skills that they can take into consideration to create some really nice raid encounters.<br />
<br />
People want more story, not the same thing on 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 diferent dificulties... err, like Blizzard loves to say &quot;3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 more content&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And quite frankly, I agree. Five man dungeons have never been anything more than a means to an end.<br />
They don't have to be. That is what makes me so sad. Dungeons could be those interesting challenges that take dedication for 5 man groups. Like small raids. That would be worth the effort of designing them. Players would progress in them for a long time. They would be an interesting challenge. But they turned them into easy sightseeing spots. You go there, you click something, it dies. And it is Heroic (TM). No fucking shit they aren't worth the effort to create them anymore. <br />
<br />
It's like removing cross trainers from your fitness studio and giving you a couch instead. And later removing the couches, because they aren't helping you get in shape. Also the vacant space of couches isn't even filled with something else.<br />
<br />
The best boss of WoD dungeons was Rukhan in Skyreach. That should be the level of involvement all dungeon bosses should ask of you. Anyone remembers 4.0 and 4.1? I enjoyed dungeons at that point! Sometimes I couldn't finish a dungeons with a pickup group. And that was ok.</div></div><hr />

It does not work. You find your target demographic and make it grow, not change every expansion trying to get them all to get along.<br />
<br />
At the beginning, when the game enjoyed great growth, it was Blizzard's game, designed by people that loved immersive RPG -&gt; MMORPG. They didn's listen to anyone, it was THEIR game, we played by their rules, in their universe. Once they did start listening to public? Well look at the sub graph - when they did start listening the graphs went down and have never been up again since. I see posts about people saying what the new class should be in next expansion, what the theme should be, where we should go. Screw that, let's go where Blizzard take us. I see 100 page posts about how the Tinker must come. No it should not. That would be the most boring thing ever. It's not up to us.</div></div><hr />

Now Pvper's who are by far the minority are whining and crying, so now blizz caters to them giving out everything easily, again why become a better player in Wow when you know they will eventually nerf it. Already nerfing Blackhand, theres no reason to, people are taking shit comps into raids and crying its too hard. Most of the good players left, now left with the bottom of the barrel lol.<br />

<br />
So i guess you have cleared Mythic or are Rank 1? Or are you just another bad that cries and whines waiting for nerfs?<br />
<br />
You are so rude and condescending. In no way does someone elses progression influence you and you still feel the need to insult them. Going for rank or doing Mythic is not fun for everyone, so these more accessible events giving people reason to play again is fair statement to be maid.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Salech</div><div class="date">2015-05-08, 07:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, there are not. No MMO has PvP as enjoyable as WoW. I've tried all the MMOs that claim to be dedicated to PvP, and they suck beyond imagination. No MMO has the fluidity and lack of realistic physics that makes combat fast and instantly responsive like WoW. Don't you dare bring up that garbage game Guild Wars 2 and it's mud skating movement along with it's red or blue bullshit color scheme in PvP.<br />
<br />
Secondly, some people here are so fucking miserable. If you have nothing you enjoy and have nothing but negativity to spread, why post? You're not interested in playing WoW. You just want to bitch and moan about it. All of these features sound amazing to me. And like it or not, Timewalking is a new feature for WoW regardless of whether &quot;it was on the beta.&quot; No shit, it had to get testing somewhere.<br />
<br />
WoW PvP is one of the worst PvP there is in any MMO there is, seriously it's bad and i guess you can do well in WoW PvP but got your ass handed to you in Gw2/rift/SwTor and all the other MMOs?, WoW's PvP is as good as the love story in Twilight. <br />
<br />
Why is it only okay to post positive stuff then? either you have no postive/negative stuff or you have both, don't be a fucking white knight dude just because you're one of those that would eat a huge shit from blizzard and call it &quot;best food ever&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Did you seriously just try and make the argument pvp pet battles arent pvp coz you are fighting someones pets. You know that character you are using is just as fake as the pets it has.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the reward is a heroic cache and the heroic hfc item level is 710,not 720<br />
<br />
Also raiders cant &quot;carry&quot; in timewalking as the item level scales back.Read again : Your character’s level and gear scales down to the dungeon at Heroic difficulty, but the loot you receive is scaled back up, making it a great way to gear up characters as well as receive cool items for transmogrification.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Blackrock Foundry<br />
Blackhand<br />
Blackhand now only spawns 2 massive demolitions, but each massive demolition spawns 2 demolition piles.<br />
<br />
Blackhand now only spawns 2 mines.<br />
<br />
Blackhands phase 1 room no longer fills up with lava, instead a pet battle arena has been added to the outside wall so that players can do pet battles without having to hearth out during afk time.<br />
<br />
Pet battles can now be done during combat.<br />
<br />
Blackhand no longer spawns siegemakers or uses his &quot;Marked for Death&quot; ability unless there are at least 4 hunters in the group.<br />
<br />
Blackhands balcony adds now do 50% damage.<br />
<br />
Blackhand will now grip and throw 4 melee and 1 healer for smash during phase 2, to ensure nobody misses the balcony.<br />
<br />
There is now only 1 bomb and 1 mark during phase 3.<br />
<br />
Should you have 4 hunters, the Siegemaker will spawn, no additional Siegemaker will spawn until the current Siegemaker has been killed.<br />
<br />
The Siegemaker will only launch a mortar if you have over 15 ranged dps.<br />
<br />
The platform has been increased to 300% of its original size during phase 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't worry about what 99% of the community thinks. With 7.1 million people all speaking their minds, you have to look past the braying of simpletons who are bitching just to bitch.<br />
<br />
Personally, I usually don't log in during the weekends but that looks like it'll change and get me playing on a few more days every month, which is more than enough. The people who always get most upset about &quot;NOTHING TO DO!!1!11!1one!11!&quot; always seem to play an amount that is absolutely ridiculous. Had a conversation with a guild member who left last week:<br />
<br />
&quot;Why did you decide to leave, so and so?&quot;<br />
&quot;There's no content for me to do, Eli.&quot;<br />
&quot;I'm sorry to hear that, so and so. Might I ask how often you were playing? Maybe you're just burnt out?&quot;<br />
&quot;I play 7 days a week.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well no fucking shit you ran out of things to do. o_O I log in on Tuesdays and Thursdays for raid night, and I'll end up logging in on either Saturday or Sunday now to do whatever the weekly event is. To me, three days of gameplay a week for 15$ a month is a fantastic value, but some people just don't see it that way I guess. Must suck to be unable to be happy.</div></div><hr />

This so much. The game will not die but many old players (including me, was playing since release) quit the game already. I also feel VERY sorry for the people who call this timewalking stuff &quot;content&quot; when we ran these dungeons YEARS ago until we vomited. It' a nice gimmick, yes. It has been requested by many players for ages, yes. It will be actually new for certain people, yes. But is it content? Fuck no. Tanaan is content, and something similar should have been released for 6.1, even if it was only a few new dungeons, a new BG or a new small quest hub with some side lore. The same goes for mythic dungeons btw, it's old content but people will farm them because of itemlevels. Guys, Blizzard is shitting on you but you don't realize it.</div></div><hr />

Master battle pet trainers are the fastest way to level pets by a huge margin. Triple battle pet experience means that you will be able to level and pet from 1 to 25 by carrying it through 2 pandaria trainers. Trying to earn an ultimate stone from people pet battles will be far less efficient.</div></div><hr />
