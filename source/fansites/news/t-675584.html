Tier 10 Paladin - Preview<br />
Oh Paladins ... You took away so many hours of my week-end ... Time to explain a few things!<br />
<br />
The screenshot of the Tier 10 Paladin set I posted a few days ago had pants, and a pretty pink helm. I displayed this version of the set because it was the only one where the models/textures were linked to actual in-game item (even if they aren't implemented yet). I checked the files more carefully and had to figure out a few things. <br />
<br />
The Pink helm<br />
The pink reflection on the helm is obviously a bug, check the blue version of the set if you want to see how the helm looks like. <br />
<br />
Robe or not ?<br />
A few NPCs already use the Tier 10 Paladin set .... with a robe! I decided to use this model until Blizzard reveals if the final version of the set will use a robe or not. The legs just look strange and I'll just try to forget about them for the moment. <br />
<br />
Multi-race ?<br />
Not gonna happen. The set is in early beta and I don't want anyone to think it's the final version, for the time being enjoy the new screenshots! <br />

Patch 3.3 - Tutorials and Lag Report<br />
The latest PTR Build greatly modified the tutorials on new characters. They're now much more useful and it will probably make the life of new players a little easier. <br />
<br />

<br />
A new button was also added to the interface, it will let you report lag issues faster to the Gamemasters. <br />

Hallow's End Achievement Issue<br />
We have recently applied a hotfix that should no longer cause certain Candy Buckets to affect a character's ability to complete the Trick or Treats of Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor and Outlands for Hallow's End. Characters are now free to get candy from any location they have not yet gathered from and can complete the achievements. <br />
<br />

Blue posts<br />
Skipping Crowd Control in Raids<br />
Not many people were skipping CC for Ulduar when it first launched. Now if you're overgearing content, you're overgearing content. ToC doesn't have trash, though if you are ignoring CC for heroic champs, I'd be interesting in seeing it. Yes, the CC has PvP-like DR, but that makes smart CC an even bigger component of the fight, not something to be ignored lightly. Icecrown is a traditional yet massive and epic instance. There will be trash. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677228502-cc-is-still-dead-despite-what-was-said.html))<br />
<br />
Icecrown Hard Modes and Trophy System<br />
As other players have pointed out, the &quot;medium&quot; difficulty comes at doing some of the easier bosses in heroic mode. ToC only has 5 encounters, so there isn't a ton of granularity. Icecrown has more (though not 31) so we can provide more granularity.<br />
<br />
I also have a hunch that some of the bosses on normal mode are going to be more challenging than the final boss of ToC normal for the same reason.<br />
<br />
We have a couple of tweaks to the trophy system for Icecrown that we think capture the best of both the Ulduar and ToC systems. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677348491-twitter-dev-chat--feedback.html))<br />
<br />
Icecrown &quot;harder&quot; than Trial of the Crusader<br />
They are harder in an absolute sense because they hit harder and have more health. They are not harder (for the most part) in a relative sense because you probably have better gear now than when you first went into ToC. Our goal is not to let players raid all the up until Icecrown and then throw a gate in front of them that says &quot;Must be this elite to ride this ride.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, if you are that elite, Arthas heroic says hi. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677348491-twitter-dev-chat--feedback.html))<br />

Scourge Strike<br />
We're not going to let an attack that ignores armor do the same damage as an attack that is reduced by armor. The problem is that when armor gets reduced, a physical attack hits for more while a magical attack does not. The answer I keep reading is &quot;Just buff Scourge Strike.&quot; No. It can't do more base damage as long as it bypasses armor.<br />
<br />
Armor pen as a stat on gear is going away. The concept of reducing armor (through say Battle Stance or Sunder Armor) is not going away. It's entirely possible a spec or two might improve their armor pen through the Mastery feature. Even if it was going away, magical attacks still can't hit as hard as physical attacks. There would be no reason to have physical attacks.<br />
<br />
At a very high level there are two options: Scourge Strike hits at X damage but respects armor, or Scourge Strike hits at X*0.5 and ignores armor. Talents etc. can modify this, but they all have their individual budgets too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20433766548-scourge-strike-on-the-ptr--information.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Feral Druid changes on PTRs<br />
We made the change to discourage a very specific form of gameplay. Specifically, this was:<br />
<br />
1. Get the proc, but don't use it.<br />
2. Build up 5 more cps on the target.<br />
3. Now Cyclone before you do another finishing move.<br />
4. Let your energy fill to full.<br />
5. As soon as the Cyclone ends, unleash a huge Ferocious Bite with 5 cps and full energy.<br />
<br />
Aside from the very high damage of an almost unpreventable Ferocious Bite, this way of using the proc worked counter to what we were trying to encourage. It's often easy for melee classes to get tunnel vision and just unleash every attack on the same target rather than switching targets or otherwise responding to what is going on in the fight. We'd rather see the proc get used to Cyclone say a healer or someone chasing your teammates.<br />
<br />
In short, the intent was to give cats more team utility, not to give them a delivery mechanism for guaranteed full Ferocious Bites. With this change it will be risky or impossible to sit on the proc for long. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677579013-feral-druid-nerf-on-the-ptr-revert-it.html))<br />
<br />
Nature's Grace<br />
I agree Nature's Grace is a big part of the problem here. We changed Gift of the Earth Mother for pretty similar reasons. However, Nature's Grace is a Really Big Deal. We honestly keep talking about changing it, but we're also paranoid about screwing it up because Balance dps is dependent on it. NG is probably an overbudget talent, but in this case if we nerfed iit, we'd have to mess with Balance in a lot of other areas to compensate. We'll almost certainly do it at some point, but I worry about messing with it for 3.3. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20464487668-haste-balance-and-beyond.html))<br />

unless you are a masochist, then you would make an avatar of something you enjoy or brings you joy, and since your avatar is of judgment it is safe to assume you liked the set.<br />

While I'm all for insanely difficult heroic modes, ICC should be very challening on normal mode too, IMO. It should be DOABLE, technically speaking, in full TOC gear, but only barely, and the Lich King should definitely require some gear upgrades before he's technically feasible - yes, even on normal mode. If ICC is full of Mimirons and Yoggs, with some easier ones tossed in, from a this-boss-is-tough standpoint, we'll be in good shape. If it's full of normal-mode Anub'araks and Beasts? ...Not so much. I have a lot, a LOT of faith in Blizzard, I really do. I know they can deliver. I just wonder if they will, because their design philosophy has changed so radically and so often.</div></div><hr />

I hate this because it is like TOC clear normal in one hour and then it's hard modes (disclaimer)<br />
<br />
(disclaimer) you actually need to have around 20 excellent players with precise set ups.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the blatant talk over of how - yes ICC bosses will be harder but only because there is a tiny gap until you get like two pieces of ICC gear so they will hit a little harder and have more health until then. So same steamroll as TOC mr dev</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree Nature's Grace is a big part of the problem here. We changed Gift of the Earth Mother for pretty similar reasons. However, Nature's Grace is a Really Big Deal. We honestly keep talking about changing it, but we're also paranoid about screwing it up because Balance dps is dependent on it. NG is probably an overbudget talent, but in this case if we nerfed iit, we'd have to mess with Balance in a lot of other areas to compensate. We'll almost certainly do it at some point, but I worry about messing with it for 3.3. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20464487668-haste-balance-and-beyond.html))<br />
<br />
I totally agree here about how hard it would affect Balance to touch NG or to *nerf* it in other words. Balance is already extremely low dps at the moment compared to other classes. Unless they get some really amazing changes in other talents to compensate, I don't think personally that NG should be modified anymore.</div></div><hr />

Nobody denies that men can still look masculine in robes/kilts. And those kids who say &quot;gay&quot; all the time are just retarded.<br />
<br />
But plate robes dont make any sense! We can have cloth robe, leather robe, even chain / mail robe. But plate robe? what kind of retards would create and wear a PLATE ROBE??? <br />
<br />
We know wow is a fantasy game. But plate robe??? c'mom, blizzard, have some common sense!!!</div></div><hr />

&quot;Plate kilts&quot; expand on this kind of concept. More advanced games like Aion actually display kilts and the underlying plate pants, but WoW's graphic engine is 5 years old.<br />
<br />
What you need to imagine is that your dude is wearing a robe OVER his plate pants, which is actually a very fitting paladin theme.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2009-10-26, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LoL, 2 cents:<br />
<br />
1st - If you're a Paladin and you're complaning about the kilt, then:<br />
1) You're Holy Pally, who'll never have problems with matching belts and BOOTs. No worry about looking stupid with a &quot;holy&quot; gear + boots and belts with skulls.<br />
<br />
2) You're in fact gay or have problems with your own sexuality, lol. You think that using a kilt would just get you one step closer to show your &quot;inner queen&quot; and you don't want to admit you're gay, lol.<br />
<br />
btw, yes, kilts are just cloth over your real plate pants. It's just like a Tabard, but more fitting to your actual gear/colors and with some kind of meaning (like holy stuff). And if the visor could close when you enter in combat... man... that would be a win...<br />
<br />
2nd- I agree that there should be the Normal (easy) and Heroic (hard), but...<br />
<br />
Blizzard stated that anyway, they would increase the dificult for both. Remeber &quot;Raid 101&quot;? It doesn't help but just ruin the feeling/story that they want to sell to their customers that the final boss is just as faceroll as the 1st boss that everyone saw a year ago. If he is that stupid, why did we wast soo much time? Gear should never be an explanation. Remember that T9 is crafted by the Argent Crusade, so...<br />
<br />
That also reminds me that Blizzard wants to make things cleaner and that things shoul make sense. So why heroic 5mans are that faceroll if the term &quot;Heroic&quot; designates something hard (hardmode) in WoW? At least for people who can't raid, that should be a interesting line of progression.<br />
<br />
Sure &quot;old&quot; 5man heroics would be faceroll anyway after a few patches thanks to new gear, just like heroic raids. But why the new 5mans after that would need to still be faceroll stuff like H-ToC (let's be honest here)? Don't know how the new icecrown 5mans are in dificult level yet, but don't think that they will make it tunned for the T9 people.</div></div><hr />

Is this some kind of subtle joke? Are we speaking of the same Warcraft lore that revolves around a fallen jed.. paladin who because the Dark Lord of the Si... I mean, a Lich King and features a god of death and madness called Yog-Sot... Yogg-Saron, sorry?<br />
<br />
The Warcraft lore is a SHAMELESS rip off of 60 years of pop culture. Almost every corner and line of WoW is a cameo/mockery/omage to another source, from Haris Pilton to elder gods. <br />
And it's probably its redeeming quality - on its own, Wacraft's lore is dire.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhysode</div><div class="date">2009-10-26, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay I don't know how long this will be so prepare for a wall of text.<br />
<br />
I have lurked these forums for a long time now and I think I've figured out a few things. However, there are a few things I still don't understand.<br />
<br />
Such as, what constitutes a HARDCORE raider? Is it time spent raiding? Volume of content cleared? Amount of gear acquired? Belonging to a raiding guild? Is it some combination of the above?<br />
<br />
Please understand these questions are rhetorical, because I have the feeling the answer will vary from one person to the next.<br />
<br />
For myself I would hardly say I am a hardcore raider. I do not belong to a raiding guild, I only raid 3 nights a week at max, I do clear TOC10/25, And the latest raid content on a weekly basis. I am progressing in ToGC 10/25 when I can get invited to a run, and am known and respected as one of the better tanks on my server. Yes I found ToC to be easy when run by competent players and I find ToGC to be a challenge of sorts. However, I don't understand the complaining about the difficulty of content.<br />
<br />
Last I Checked a vast majority of players have not cleared togc 25 and most realms have no one who has completed 25 man insanity.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that a majority of the frustrated players share the following attrinutes.<br />
<br />
1. They can clear 10/25 normal modes<br />
2. They can't clear 10/25 heroic modes<br />
3. They are upset when they see players with normal mode gear because they feel it cheapens their accomplishments.<br />
<br />
But in reality what we all need to remember is the 99 or 95% of players that aren't hard core raiders are what make the game what it is and available for the rest of us to play.</div></div><hr />

LOL @ priest , is too simple, that model even looks similar to another one is been in the game before.<br />
LOL @ paladins, freaking ugly! , don't like the helm, hopefully the face protector will come down , let's say it automaticly comes down when you enter combat, that would be badass!!! , but I hope they keep pants because they are paladins not spell casters!!!! and shoulders look way TOO shamanistic to me, I think they should look more paladinistic. What do I mean? <br />
shamanistic = powers of elemets (tell me the shoulders dont look like shaman's shoulders lol)<br />
paladinistic = power of justice, I'd like to see shoulders that look like shields on shoulders , with a lion face sticking out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's more than a shade of grey between how differently things are executed still.<br />
<br />
Most RPGs (both MMO and not) have a lore, and while true originality is hard if not impossible to find, you can stumble into shining examples of people who actually tried to invent something with a soul. WoW isn't a particularly shiny example, considering the only remotely original element of the lore is the Emerald Dream and from there on I could cite you the book/D&amp;D/movie/pop culture source for basically EVERYTHING there is ingame. During the RTS times they pretended to be original while copying, now they are finally open about it and do it shamelessy.</div></div><hr />

Like for real the helm is retarded especially the shape from the side &quot;hey guys i have a banana on my head with a skull at the end&quot; the neck is stupid(even disregarding the color by the way purple is poor choice of coloring), I cannot stand the mask thing even if it comes down and the shoulders how the ribbon comes onto the lil hooks or horns whatever, it is complete crap and waste of time to even design this. In no way shape form or fashion does this armor say paladin to me, like the shoulders for real would look so much better if you keep just the two plates and that is it the trim and then the hooks look terrible. Overall the shoulders just don't look good with the helm at all. And the fire? Change the fire to a white/yellow glow of holiness or something and get rid of the cloth look for the chest gloves and robe. Or you know what blizz just scratch this entire model and start over cause it honestly looks like complete crap. I have faith that you can develop something far better armor to wear for pretty much all classes to Defeat Arthas in the ultimate freaking Villain in my opinion like come on guys. This is the peak of warcraft lore and your gonna go cheap not spend the time you should on certain things and make me wear crap until cat comes out. So I decides to honor blizz with what needs to be removed from all gear. Basicall the only classes gear that looks close to good is priests locks(please lose the sewn up look) and warriors (please make the chest go all the way down to pants or something). All other classes I really think you guys should throw all the designs out the window and start over. Cause honestly I expect way better than what im looking at right now.</div></div><hr />
