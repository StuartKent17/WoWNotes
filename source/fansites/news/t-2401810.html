Blizzard recommends that you upgrade to a 64-bit operating system by July 1, 2018! 
When World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth™ is live, we will no longer support the World of Warcraft game client for 32-bit operating systems. The vast majority of World of Warcraft players are already running the 64-bit version of the game, and this change will allow us to focus on making the 64-bit version as stable and efficient as possible.

Blizzard recommends that you upgrade to a 64-bit operating system by July 1, 2018!<br />
When World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth™ is live, we will no longer support the World of Warcraft game client for 32-bit operating systems. The vast majority of World of Warcraft players are already running the 64-bit version of the game, and this change will allow us to focus on making the 64-bit version as stable and efficient as possible.<br />
<br />
If you are using a 32-bit operating system, you will need to upgrade to 64-bit. In most cases (as with Windows 7 through 10), you have the option to upgrade for free, but you may need to reinstall some applications. Check with your OS maker to find out how to upgrade to a 64-bit operating system and what applications will be affected.<br />
<br />
Why We’re Retiring 32-Bit Support<br />
The memory limitations of 32-bit operating systems can impact the playability and stability of many modern games, and 64-bit operating systems have been industry standard for several years. As with past expansions, we’re making a great many technological updates to WoW with Battle for Azeroth to further enhance the game experience, and the time is right to make this change.<br />
<br />
We recommend updating to the 64-bit version of the game before July 1, 2018, to ensure your World of Warcraft gaming experience is unaffected.</div></div><hr />

How can they give 6 months when it launches in 2?<br />
<br />
Also to be fair lol at anyone still running a 32 bit OS for gaming. You are literally asking for it at this point since games have been releasing for the good part of a year or two now that have no support for a 32 bit OS.</div></div><hr />

It's not like they released the BfA minimum requirements back in January (http://www.wowhead.com/news=281321.3/world-of-warcraft-battle-for-azeroth-system-requirements-for-windows-and-mac) or anything.</div></div><hr />

The only caveat is that you're going to do a clean install - the 32 bit and 64 bit files are incompatible, making an UPGRADE impossible.<br />
<br />
So all of your files will have to be backed up first, and all of your apps will need to be re-installed afterwards. NOTE: 32 bit apps still work just fine on Windows 64 bit so if you have any native 32 bit apps running now, they will surely work on the 64 bit version of Windows.</div></div><hr />

To be fair you can get a 64 bit machine pretty cheap. If one can't manage this maybe you need to spend less time on wow and more time getting your life together?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it is a choice. You can make the choice to go out and buy the $300 e-machines special that is probably still running 64 bit at this point, and would run WOW on low-medium graphics.<br />
<br />
Or you can make the choice to stop playing WoW when it rolls 64-bit. Quite simple really.<br />
<br />
64 bit has been a thing for the past 5+ years, if you're still rocking 32-bit at this point it's by choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
He did have a choice, he chosen to use shit hardware and not upgrade, just like his choice means I might not want him in my group because I never know if he Potato might end up over baked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Time to invest, should have time before BFA...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Look I do feel sorry for him, I remember my peasant days, I must say the floor in World of warcraft looked great, because that is all I could look at to maintain decent FPS, because if I looked up... my FPS would drop to 1fps, do you know how hard it was to level in STV with 1FPS? That was my choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
But, he had plenty of time and I'm pretty sure Blizzard warned they were going 64 bit some time ago, there is no excuse<br />
<br />

You can't halt progress.</div></div><hr />

Seriously? The cost of upgrading is a 64bit operating system (which most likely he can get a license for), which is not optimal but fine with just 4GBs ram. If he has less, then a 2-4GB ram upgrade, especially on older rams, is extremely cheap. A 32bit system can be converted to 64bit with less that 100€, if you can't afford a whole new machine.<br />
<br />
Being stuck with 32bit in 2018 isn't poverty, it's laziness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a laptop that I used to use frequently for travel with WoW and D3 on it, and it's a 32-bit system that's about 10 years old now. Still runs WoW fine, albeit not at 60 fps (more like 30). However, I think it won't meet the minimum specs for BfA, since they've been elevated a decent amount from past WoW xpac requirements. Be that as it may, this would likely impact those people who either never upgrade their hardware or may have limited funds to upgrade their systems... although I admit it's probably pretty cheap to replace hardware if it's that old to something 64-bit and still better.</div></div><hr />

Uhm..... what?<br />
<br />
All I could make out from that is you think it's not an issue with a 32 bit os.<br />
<br />
It most certainly is since it has hardware limitations that go way back. You should NOT be running a 32 bit OS for gaming in this day and age with how accessible 64 bit is.<br />
<br />
They would not state either that the majority are on a 64 bit OS unless they had the evidence which they more than likely do from the sample it takes of pc specs.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. The majority (in fact almost all) of those on 32-bit OSes simply did not know better or didn't bother to upgrade later to 64-bit OSes. The problem? OEMs cheaped out and used up their 32-bit key supplies instead of putting 64-bit versions on the 64-bit hardware even though it had been vetted and been standard for years. So pretty darn close to 100% of those users that didn't start out with WinXP on their current system were OEMd into 32-bit land. It didn't help any that Microsoft forced the full price of a retail version to get 64-bit compliancy since you could not do an in-place upgrade from 32-bit to 64-bit. A clean install was required for that and a lot of people either didn't know or knew and a) didn't want to deal with it and/or b) couldn't afford to as Microsoft's OSes aren't exactly cheap at the retail level, especially the Professional versions, which are night and day better than the Home versions.</div></div><hr />

The cost of upgrading is a 64bit operating system (which most likely he can get a license for), which is not optimal but fine with just 4GBs ram. If he has less, then a 2-4GB ram upgrade, especially on older rams, is extremely cheap. A 32bit system can be converted to 64bit with less that 100€, if you can't afford a whole new machine.<br />
<br />
Being stuck with 32bit in 2018 isn't poverty, it's laziness.<br />

If you are still on a 32 bit OS today that is your own fault. That version was being slowly shoved out years ago. Of course Blizzard were going to drop it and they made their intentions clear months ago.<br />
<br />
And as long as that 32 bit OS is legit you are still able to claim free upgrades to Windows 10 64 bit if I recall which doesn't require that much to run.<br />

For wow even 16GB is overkill and I still get shit frames in patches of suramar. It all comes down to how much ram your GPU will utilize but it becomes obvious that after w while you must take into account how much electricity you use. I think a rig with 1060-1070 6gb and a 16GB ram can stand games for the next 2 years very well and another 2 years decent. For wow double these times.</div></div><hr />

No it's not.<br />
<br />
WoW is moving to the point 8gb is minimum. Couple more expansions later and it will be. It's still 4GB for now.<br />
<br />
4GB is the most a 32 bit OS can handle. However that is not the only issue Blizzard have from maintaining support from it. Having to maintain a version very little people use is not worth the cost to upkeep it. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

When I was that age I wanted a pc. My dad offered to put half the money in if I got a part time job. So I did with some other odd jobs. Made up the £350 needed in 4 months.<br />

You turn it on by sending a hotwheel down a track that eventually presses a button.<br />
that or when you overclock it, it begins two spinning pads that cause a hotwheel to go through a constant loop like this <br />

<br />
Not really a short notice. 64bit computers have been standard for over half of WoW's life. Plus, BfA's minimum requirements state 64bit, and those have been available since before BfA's alpha started. People have had months, effectively years, to move on to 64bit. Someone has to be super lazy or actively trying to stay on 32bit in order to not have a 64bit system while gaming.<br />
<br />
I'm also confident that even cost is not an excuse, it's been years since &quot;new&quot; computers were 32bit. My computer was &quot;prebuilt&quot; and sent to me in 2011 and I didn't even have a 32bit option when ordering. I get it, many gamers could have hand-me-downs or something they can afford, but even the hand-me-downs and affordable computers they would need to actually run WoW in the last few years should all be 64bit naturally.<br />
<br />
I remember finding out my dilapidated laptop I had before 2011 supported 64bit even though it came with a 32bit OS. I remember installing the Win7 RC 64bit on my crap laptop. Everyone should be able to install a 64bit OS and should at least check their computer.</div></div><hr />

It will start at BFA or w/e the current expansion is. They aren't going to maintain a relaunch of WoW, a classic server and the retail version on PC altogether.<br />

Strange that in one of your earlier posts you say about the Beta (which requires a 64-bit client to run btw) &quot;Definitely faster and smoother than it is on live atm.

I just figured they would do it like Diablo and release the base game first then move on from there. I'm just saying that PC gaming as a whole is dying IMO, a lot of gamers grow up and don't want to sit at a desk, but rather be comfortable and relax after work and just sit back and rock out a game on a couch with a controller. I just hope after playing Tera that they release WOW on console, Tera plays amazingly and Wow should work out just fine. I see changes like these and the pruning and can only hope they are gearing up to do a console release.</div></div><hr />

I see changes like these and the pruning and can only hope they are gearing up to do a console release.<br />
<br />
But to some of us even getting older, i view controllers as the anti christ of gaming, I dont touch consoles for any reason way shape or form. I also dislike console treadmill considering they all hate the backwards compatibility concept. The last console game I truly played to completion was the .hack//GU trilogy when it first came out and that was more of being a .hack fanatic than wanting to play a console game.</div></div><hr />

They only did that for the PS3/360 version of Diablo 3 because Reaper wasn't out yet. PS3/360 version was 2013. Reaper of Souls was March 14th 2014 and the PS4/XB1 versions came out on August 19th 2014 as the Ultimate Evil Edition. There is an Ultimate Evil Edition for PS3/360 as well but it's irrelevant because Blizzard don't support it.<br />
<br />
And that version is not even supported anymore. It's still on patch 2.0. The PS4/XB1 versions are upto date and have things like seasons. <br />
<br />
Diablo 3 is the one exception but the version that is one that doesn't get official support anymore. Nor was the expansion for Diablo 3 out when it came to PS3/460.</div></div><hr />

I hate single player games and story mode RPG's I can't play them after getting into MMO's I can only play MMO's and multi player aspects of other games. I play a lot of ARK, Conan, Overwatch, and now TERA. Played DCUO for a long time on PS4, but my friend and gaming buddy started playing something else and I just never came back to it.</div></div><hr />

I'm 38 and while I agree with some of your posts, I can't really view you as hardcore if you totally dismiss controllers like that. Playing MMOs with a controller and being good at it is pretty hardcore IMO. Same with some fighting games vs using an arcade stick. I hate playing MMOs with controllers btw.<br />
<br />
Also, a lot of games are also just straight up ass playing with a KB and M so I always have three controllers (Wii U Pro, Switch, and arcade stick) hooked up to my PC at all times.<br />
<br />
I also have a Nintendo Switch hooked up to my 2nd monitor.</div></div><hr />

I have an 8-year-old notebook PC with 64bit Windows 7 that I use exclusively for web browsing and there is no way that it can run the current version of WoW. Although back in the day it ran WoTLK like a dream.<br />
<br />
Been running WoW on a 2011 Dell E6520, i7-2720QM/8GB/nvs4200M, Windows 7 64bit.<br />

64 bits processor are very common since 2006 (even since 2000), almost every computer since 2006 (I take Core 2 series as a base) have a 64bit processor.<br />
All OS since Vista are optimized for 64 bits, there is absolutely no reason to still have a 32 bit OS nowadays especially if you play video games. You don't even have to pay for the same OS in 64 bit.<br />
<br />
People sticking to 32 bits are either lazy, or not knowing (now they know) or just liar trolls.</div></div><hr />

Yeah no. 64bit systems are not expensive. They are the norm. If you can afford a computer you should've been using 64bit for the past 10 years. At the very least.<br />

<br />
I'm not sure how people were managing on 4GB of memory before this point (the cap of 32 bit OS's). Microsoft Word doesn't even run on that anymore.<br />
<br />
To be fair anything MS Office will see 16GB of memory and proceed to use about 20GB of that. I'm looking at you Excel.</div></div><hr />

Ok.<br />
<br />
Windows XP 64 bit came out in 2005.<br />
<br />
Vista came out to the general public in Dec 06/Jan 07.<br />
<br />
64 bit has been a thing for general availability for 12-13 years. And the technology needed for it even longer.<br />
<br />
So yes if you are still on 32 bit which is clearly a minority for WoW then that is your own fault.</div></div><hr />

Well considering that is for professional software then you shouldn't be playing games on that 32 bit pc and actually use it for work.<br />
<br />
There is zero reason to use a 32 bit system for gaming anymore unless you are building retro gaming pcs. <br />
<br />
Blizzard would not remove the option if they weren't sure about how many are using the 32 bit client. And if we go by that 2.5% Steam statistic someone posted. How many do you really think of the WoW playerbase are running a 32 bit OS?</div></div><hr />

Again that is their problem.<br />

Blizzard are not going to support an extreme minority just to keep the game limited.<br />

64 bit Windows has a Win64/32 subsystem built in to allow you to run 32 bit applications. Additionally - you can install the HyperV system on Windows and create a 32 bit VM to run those apps.<br />

Lots of solutions - no excuse outside being poor to stay on 32 bit. Even our low end point of sale terminals are 64 bit these days.</div></div><hr />

It's not really just about improving the game graphically.<br />

It mostly means they don't have to work with any big limitation now. Well other than the engine but to be honest they've done pretty well with it for 13 years.</div></div><hr />
