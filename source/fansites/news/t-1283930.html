Agreed Durandro, anyone remember the second to last blizzcon where there where like no announcements at all? I think the highlight was revealing monk class for D3 or so. That one was terrible. <br />
The last one was great though, so many announcements i could hardly catch my breath haha.<br />
<br />
And generally i asolutely LOVE Blizzcon, buy the virtual ticket and plant my ass the whole weekend with gaming and good snacks simultaniously. Good times &lt;3 :)</div></div><hr />

Actually they already confirmed that they will do the 4 things<br />
<br />
-A small info about Titan (don't get your hopes high, just small infos)<br />
-Diablo 3 expansion<br />
-Starcraft: legacy of the Void<br />
-WoW expansion</div></div><hr />

Glad I don't have to try getting a ticket, I'll watch it online, thank you very much! =P<br />
<br />
<br />
Hints at the next WoW expansion? Maybe, but not as likely.<br />
<br />
When else would they announce the next expansion? I'm 99,9% sure that WoW Expansion 5 will be at Blizzcon, otherwise it'll be announced earlier at somewhere or just randomly or it's never coming (yeah right!). =)</div></div><hr />

Hey guys with the TITAN leak they said: <br />
<br />
BLIZZCON 2013 - Titan Teaser, details on expansions for all other major franchises (SC2, D3, WoW). There will be other small Titan teasers at the event but nothing major. They don't want to show any game-play until they have a solid date for beta.<br />
<br />
So be happy, NEW EXPANSIONS :D</div></div><hr />

demon hunters<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure if any significance to the 'demon hunter' being mentioned for no proper reason out of the blue whatsoever, but it does seem... relevant.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agh, screw that - they mean D3 Demon Hunter of course. <br />
<br />
Ghost = Starcraft II<br />
Demon Hunter = Diablo III<br />
Paladin = World of Warcraft</div></div><hr />

Most likely an expansion involving the Burning Legion.<br />

<br />
Yeah they were $175 the last one also. In fact, this is the first time the ticket price has not gone up from the previous Blizzcon. The haven't been $100 since the first one I think.<br />
<br />
Possibly not the best idea to book the hotel in advance (lots of people end up with hotel rooms and no tickets that way) but if you are really insistent on going, then you can pretty much guarantee that you will get a ticket, as Blizzard has not yet found a good way to stop the ticket scalpers from buying up a large amount (sometimes I think the majority) of tickets just so they can put them on ebay. The only question is how much you will end up paying for it.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info. I've booked the Marriott next to the convention center. I can still cancel it free of charge as long as I do that before the end of September. If I don't get the tickets through the Blizzcon website we probably stay at home and get the stream instead.</div></div><hr />

Ugh, I hate misinformation. No, lots of people do not book hotels and end up with no tickets. You can cancel hotel bookings until the end of September if you went thru the Blizzcon site. If you went through the hotel site, you can cancel probably up to 72 hours in advance.<br />
<br />
You would be stupid to not book a hotel now, because good luck getting a room once tickets sell at. Already have my room at the Mariott!</div></div><hr />

<br />
*shrug* Awesome if thats true. I'm simply going off the tons of people I see crying about how they already booked flight+hotel but couldn't get tickets and were stuck with bookings, every time the tickets sell out. I never booked a hotel until after I had secured tickets and have never had a problem getting a room within blocks of the convention center, easily within walking distance. The convention center being right across the street from Disneyland means there are literally thousands of rooms available within a mile of the convention center. I'm not picky about where I stay as long as the room is clean since the room is just a place to store my stuff and sleep. I could see how getting a room at the Mariott or the Hilton that is right outside the convention center doors requires booking way in advance though.</div></div><hr />

Either that, or they are referring to WoW, and they will have 2 new classes; Demon Hunters and Etherials since there is a strong probability the next expansion will be Burning Legion based. We have received hints about Illidans return and speculation was that he would be redeemed and be the master Demon Hunter so to speak. The etherials would be a stretch, but if they got a bit of work, they could become a playable race.</div></div><hr />

Sigh... Seriously? How can you not know that expansions are announced every 2 years? Blizzcon events are so predictable its not even funny. There is definitely going to be a trailer for the next WoW expansion, the next Diablo expansion and for Legacy of the Void. The only thing they might not show is Titan.<br />
<br />
Next year there won't be a Blizzcon cause they won't have nothing to show. The next Blizzcon will be in 2015. This is the same reason that they didn't have a Blizzcon in 2012, cause they had nothing to show and they saw what happened in 2010, which was the worst Blizzcon ever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is nothing showing there won't be a Blizzcon next year. The reason they didn't have it last year is because they were too busy with multiple game releases. They had one the year before just fine and announced some stuff, and the year before that and announced nothing.<br />
<br />
I actually think they are just as likely to have a Blizzcon next year because they wouldn't be releasing any full games and they would have more Titan info to give.<br />
<br />
2010 was a fine Blizzcon. Blizzcon isn't just for announcing things, and if people go there expecting that they are going for the wrong reasons and shouldn't go at all. Blizzcon is for the community, for connecting with Blizzard, and for the fun of it. They can keep doing Blizzcon every year and not announce a single thing more and people would still go.</div></div><hr />

Whole reason there wasn't Blizzcon 2012 was due to no announcements, after all!<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
Titan? Previews, maybe. Release date or demo footage unlikely.<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 expansion? Perhaps.<br />
<br />
Hints at the next WoW expansion? Maybe, but not as likely.<br />
<br />
Starcraft 2: Legacy of the Void? Unlikely, but I can dream.<br />
<br />
<br />
Huh? I'll guarantee they do a full reveal on WoW's next expansion at this years Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I am fully expecting an announcement regarding the next expansion + gameplay footage and race/class previews, along with something SC or Diablo related and likely the Titan reveal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ghost - SC2<br />
Demon Hunter - New class for the next WoW expansion?<br />
Paladin - New class for D3 expansion?<br />
<br />
<br />
It could be true. I'm not accepting it as a fact, but it certainly makes a lot of sense. It's typical Blizzard, and it's not like we haven't seen paladins and paladin-like classes before. A lot of people are thinking paladins will become the next D3 class, so it actually all fitis into place. It also makes you wonder why they'd choose exactly those names, what with how a BL-expac is pretty much near-confirmed; if it's not next expac, it's the one after that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not holding my breath, but it would make sense.</div></div><hr />

I think it's been 39.99$/€ the previous years. I assume it'll be the same again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asphyxiate9</div><div class="date">2013-04-05, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually they already confirmed that they will do the 4 things<br />
<br />
-A small info about Titan (don't get your hopes high, just small infos)<br />
-Diablo 3 expansion<br />
-Starcraft: legacy of the Void<br />
-WoW expansion<br />
<br />
None of that stuff is actually confirmed<br />
<br />
The titan leak mentioned time travel which turned out to be a hoax because the guy owned up to it being fake a while back in an older leak. Not many people heard about him owning up though and funnily enough this &quot;leak&quot; mentions time travel.<br />
<br />
The only likely things to be shown are Hearth Stone, WoW expansion 5, Blizzard All Stars. Anything else and you are probably getting your hopes too high, SC2 expansion just came out, and D3 expansion reveal still seems unlikely since they just got a new lead dev which probably means they only just started on it a month ago.<br />
<br />
As for Titan, i'm a firm believer we won't see anything titan related until 2015.</div></div><hr />

I think you guys are on to something :o. <br />
<br />
witch dr and wizard - intellect.<br />
demon hunter and monk - agility.<br />
barbarian and _____? - str<br />
<br />
maybe about time they introduce the next hero class in WoW: demon hunter. They will probably have a melee spec, caster/tank? spec, and a range spec (another class to use bows/guns!), and maybe wear mail (3 classes wearing plate, 2 wearing mail, 3 wearing leather, 3 wearing cloth). Maybe they can start in Outlands at Black Temple, and maybe all of those demonic portals and camps in Outlands will be our gateway to the battlefield with the Legion.<br />
<br />
ghost? no idea. I dont think they're gonna bring back ghost recon though... maybe all-stars related</div></div><hr />

<br />
About 99% sure the first Diablo3 expansion will be shown. Hopefully a complete reinvention of the game tbh.<br />
<br />
I don't think SC2 Expansion 3 will be shown yet. 2014 Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
Titan will most likely be given its real name, a few details, but not much else. Probably 2014 Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just my guess. Hopefully wrong about Titan though, would love to see what Blizzard has been working on all these years.</div></div><hr />

Shit sells, so it's valuable!<br />
<br />
Modern consumer logic. It's a good time to start a business.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nubzoe</div><div class="date">2013-04-09, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Congrats, Millie! Your lack of intelligence is so cringeworthy it made me register an account just to let you know.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shit sells, so it's valuable!<br />
<br />
Value is subjective so if a product does sell, it probably is valuable (monetary, material, use, important, etc) to the consumer(s) who purchased said product. Common sense, you should learn it and then use it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Judging from from these two inane and sarcasm-dripped statements, you seem to reek of stupidity and lack proper education. It just blows my mind how irredeemably vacuous people can be and still not realize it. This quote doesn't deserve a proper and dignified response or an explanation. That said...<br />
<br />
&quot;Millie, what you've just said ... is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul...&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm feeling embarrassed and ashamed for you.</div></div><hr />

Consumer trends are interesting. Beanie babies, Holland tulip bulbs. Bubbles ftw!<br />
<br />
Also I don't know what's wrong with Nubzoe, he seems exceptionally grumpy. Also not necessarily correct about the inherent value of an item...that's like saying that what a company's stock trades at necessarily reflects the value of the company (it doesn't necessarily, which is why there are people like financial analysts who attempt to determine intrinsic value).</div></div><hr />
