<br />
CMs have always had pretty high turnover since there's not much room for advancement and the community is toxic, so Rygarius leaving was no surprise.<br />
<br />
Micky Neilson left because he wants to be a novelist and he's still working as a freelancer for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Who was the other guy who recently left? Jay Wilson? The community hated his guts anyway, deserving or not.<br />
<br />
Nevermind that between Overwatch and Hearthstone, Blizzard's looking at higher profits than they've had in years. It's not like it's a sinking ship; far from it. I've even heard rumblings from people close to the source that active subscribers are already starting to climb back up towards pre-WoD levels (not that they'll report the numbers).</div></div><hr />

IIRC it had nothing to do with sexism, but rather them screwing up Tyrande's post WC3-characterization. In WC3 she was the de facto ruler of the night elves and their military leader to boot. A badass warrior queen, more or less, fighting on the frontlines.<br />
<br />
And then when Malfurion finally returned from hibernation in Cataclysm, they sort of turned her into his arm candy, even getting second billing in the faction leader short story despite her being the leader of the night elves (not Furion).<br />
<br />
And then in Well of Eternity they had Malfurion cut her dialogue off by saying, &quot;Hush, Tyrande.&quot; And people thought the ship's name referenced that.</div></div><hr />

Why, are you worried that they won't be around to provide us with another expansion on par with WoD?<br />
Perhaps the giant failure of WoD is why these people are exiting ( or being exit'ed ).</div></div><hr />

Bashiok, Crithto, Zarhym, and now Rygarius? They've all been there for years.

Well yea those people left. Being there years and still being a CM because there was no available promotion for them would make it where a change in your career is prbly a good thing.<br />

I found Olivia Grace to be horribly toxic and a hiring mistake on Blizzard's part. She accomplished nothing while she was at Blizzard, and her Twitter feed was impossible to follow because she was using it for both personal and Blizzard announcements, often sharing her own polarizing opinions. Most Blizzard employees respect that when they are in a public role they understand they represent the company because of their name and following, and are not a separate entity anymore. A true unprofessional employee if there ever was one with poor social media skills. <br />
<br />
I for one cheer her departure and hope that it was more Blizzard's idea than her own. In the future they should devote the eSports position to someone with some actual tenure in performing that role. I can't think of one thing she even did while she was there that was worth mentioning, which tells me her management was poor across the board. As a PvP follower, I'm hoping Blizzard will smarten up about this role and treat it with actual respect than to put someone like that person in this role again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would definitely say my comments to her in person. She was not the person they should have hired and I've had interaction with her in the past. I've also had experience firing people of her caliber, and to let them know the truth is usually the best course of action. Unless you're a weak person who can't handle anything beyond good reviews. The world isn't wine and roses and filled with muppets who feed you lies that you're awesome at every step. If you want to eat, then be good at your job. Based on my experience with her, I hope she does read the comments and benefits from the criticism. To let a person constantly fail while telling them &quot;good job&quot; is cruel, because the person is going to continue to fall short and believe they are doing well. Sometimes the best medicine is a sledge hammer.<br />
<br />
And for those wondering about defection - Customer Service roles at Blizzard are very demanding and they offer little in the way of reward. It's basically a job and not a career. Promotion is done from within, and anyone who makes it up the chain in the organization usually choose to stay. Those passed over choose to find a different situation. Blizzard is a company, they aren't the magical land of Oz.</div></div><hr />

I honestly think blizzard tried to spice up their esports scene a little bit with Lore and this girl who got some viewers because of lore.<br />

<br />
Ive had good enough experiences with her, sure her agenda gets to me sometimes, but she was a nice enough person. As someone who has worked with the ANZ Esports team, Blizzard are really trying to push that scene, but WoW will NEVER be an esport. She was mostly involved with WoW so it was a job that didnt really have much security I wouldnt have thought. <br />
<br />
She also moved from the UK to the US for the job, so thats a little disappointing for her, hopefully her next role is something worth the move.<br />
<br />
A lot of the tournaments WoW has had have been on the back of her and Lore's work. So for those wondering, that has been her contribution. Theyve been pushing more and more supported events.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I am not quite sure what you mean with how she caused the outrage, she did write one thing that I agreed on about Jaina:<br />
<br />
'K if I could write WoW lore... Jaina gets tired of Alliance being boring, kills Varian, takes his throne, declares war on the Horde.'<br />
<br />
Honestly, I didn't like the idea of her killing Varian as I found Varian likable, but with the current way (Legion) and the Alliance &quot;update&quot;, I do think that this would be the most interesting turn they could take. If they also give the Alliance Gilneas, the Horde Zul'Gurub and just let World PvP return with these changes, I honestly believe that this would really reignite some excitement in the game.</div></div><hr />

really nothing, all the ppl leaving blizzard at the moment are CM that have literally 0 chance of promotions, if you keep track from the one that have leave, most of then move away from gaming, some are writing novels, while other are working on personal stuffs. <br />

The color of our symbol is gold and can be substituted for yellow, it looks good. I think the lion being blue would look stupid. It's not &quot;our colour&quot; the colour of our clothes for the alliance is gold/yellow on blue but the colour of our symbol is gold/yellow.

Right about what? I'm hardly the only one who has unsubbed and decided to leave this mess behind. Legion will be more of the same because of the direction Blizz has stubbornly taken the game since WoD. They won't revert anything unless there's an enormous outcry and sub loss, and even then they'll try to squeeze it for every nickel they can get or will just thumb their noses with more PR spin and feel-good bullshit talk.<br />

The vast majority of departures have been those in the Customer Management team. These are positions that are really dead ends at Blizzard, so respect the GMs when you speak with them because they are part of it. Low chance of promotion, managers having to play the bad guy because there are no other jobs, pay is essentially trash for the location they work in, and highly abusive customers who don't mind brutalizing the staff because they're jerks. Blizzard truly only promotes to development and design from the QA team. So people that are answering your forum posts are pretty close to exit, they just haven't hit the wall.</div></div><hr />

HaHaHa, I probably laughed at this harder than I should've. Thanks for that.</div></div><hr />

I have much better games than WoW.<br />
<br />
Nice try though. :p<br />

You are still on a wow fansite.</div></div><hr />

I found Olivia Grace to be horribly toxic and a hiring mistake on Blizzard's part. She accomplished nothing while she was at Blizzard, and her Twitter feed was impossible to follow because she was using it for both personal and Blizzard announcements, often sharing her own polarizing opinions. Most Blizzard employees respect that when they are in a public role they understand they represent the company because of their name and following, and are not a separate entity anymore. A true unprofessional employee if there ever was one with poor social media skills. <br />
<br />
I for one cheer her departure and hope that it was more Blizzard's idea than her own. In the future they should devote the eSports position to someone with some actual tenure in performing that role. I can't think of one thing she even did while she was there that was worth mentioning, which tells me her management was poor across the board. As a PvP follower, I'm hoping Blizzard will smarten up about this role and treat it with actual respect than to put someone like that person in this role again.<br />
<br />
Well said. I would not be surprised if she was &quot;encouraged&quot; to move on after contributing a sum total of pretty much nothing positive whatsoever. I am still mind-boggled why the powers that be thought she was a good hire in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Anyone that finds &quot;Tyrande's silence&quot; sexist shouldn't be aloud to interact with functioning adults.<br />
<br />
Well since we're obsessing over this topic, it is kind of sexist. It's just not even remotely sexist enough to be mentioned, let alone get into an uproar over. I mean, if you told your wife/girlfriend to 'hush' when they were talking about something, they'd probably be annoyed. I doubt they would divorce/break up with you, but it is still pretty rude.<br />
<br />
The reason people presumably got upset about it is probably because it followed the miserable event in 5.1 where Tyrande was made to be foolish and very out of character, and then apologized to Varian even more out of character about how 'she was wrong, and you were right, I should be more patient' blah blah which wasn't really even sexist, just really awful storywriting as far as involved her character.<br />

He told her &quot;Hush&quot; because he was in a hurry to find illidan. And the part where she apologized to Varian is called character development. She's learning not to be so arrogant.</div></div><hr />

Sure, just like anything else that doesn't fit with the BS that Blizz has fed them for over a decade. Some people are just too dumb to know better.</div></div><hr />

That's cool, except she learned it in Warcraft III with actual quality character development, making the entire scenario serve no other purpose except to make her look extremely foolish and make Varian look good. That was awful character development, which is odd since most of MoP was otherwise great.<br />
<br />
And I thought we already covered that Malfurion telling her 'hush' was very slightly rude, but not rude enough to be made into a serious sexist complaint.</div></div><hr />
