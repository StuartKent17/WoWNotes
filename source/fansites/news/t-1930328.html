Legion Alpha to Return With New Content<br />
No ETA yet, but when Legion alpha returns it will be with some new content!

Loot Rules<br />
I've commented on this before, but MS&gt;OS is an extremely vague and fluid concept. For example someone who mains a Protection Warrior might join a raid as Arms because all the tank spots are full. While Protection is technically their MS, they are in the raid as Arms, which causes other players to believe that Arms is the MS of that Warrior. Is that Warrior, or the Master Looter, then in the wrong if they receive a tank trinket?<br />
<br />
Likewise, what about players who change specs mid-raid (such as a DPS switching to Healer) to allow the raid to continue if the group can't backfill people who have left, where do these players fit in with regards to MS&gt;OS?<br />
<br />
Let's then say that the raid leader fails to update their LFG listing to reflect the change. The change doesn't get explained to the DPS who subsequently join, causing them to feel that something has been ninja'ed when the now-Healer is given a DPS item. Is anyone actually in the wrong here?<br />
<br />
These are just some examples of the ambiguity MS&gt;OS can fall into.<br />
<br />
Generally, the Master Looter system is intended to be used in groups of people you trust. By joining a PuG raid with Master Looter set, you join knowing that the Master Looter has the power to assign the loot. If you don't seek precise clarification, in chat, on how the loot will be allocated, our Game Masters cannot then assist you on the basis of unspoken assumptions when so many grey areas are in play.<br />

<br />
No more ninjas, largely eliminates guild drama over loot, loot funneling would no longer be a thing (admittedly not a problem per se but I'd sure find the mythic race more interesting if there were a few guilds participating outside of the ones who are able to schedule multiple full clears in week 1). And on Blizz's end it would likely lead to people subbing for longer and get a longer lifespan out of a raid.</div></div><hr />

If there is loot drama in the guild due to ML, then thats a problem with the players not the system. I can agree with PL in pugs however, atleast non mythic pugs.</div></div><hr />

If you don't seek precise clarification, in chat, on how the loot will be allocated, our Game Masters cannot then assist you on the basis of unspoken assumptions when so many grey areas are in play.<br />
<br />
I can personal point out several different occasions where players have reported ninjas, with proof posted in chat and in the group finder listing, stating that loot is MS-OS, had stolen loot and GMs did nothing about it. Hell everyone on my friends list has had at least one piece of gear ninja'ed this expansion. The forums (both here, the official message board and reddit) is fulled with pictures/videos of dudes ninjaing gear. We know its your policy to not report punishments given to players, that's cool and all but dont use that as a smoke screen to hide your lack of action. <br />
<br />
I will use my report as an example :<br />
<br />
Got into a heroic highmaul group that stated in the group finder listing as MS-OS.<br />
As we were summoning, multiple people got the RL/ML to state MS-OS.<br />
We pull and killed the boss, the DPS was horrid, the healers sucked and one tank carried us to a kill.<br />
ring and plate helm drops.<br />
RL/ML takes the ring, abandons the helm and leaves.<br />
At least 3 people report the ninja.<br />
Player still had the ring until he replaced it in BRF a couple of weeks later (was watching his armory).<br />
<br />
In my example, the language could not be any clearer but nothing was done. One case in a thousand with the same result. the asshat gets what he/she/it wants and a group has had its time wasted. <br />
<br />
I play on a small realm, with little active players on the horde side. Raiding is something I enjoyed but I cant get enough players to form a decent guild group so am forced to pug. I lead groups here and there but am usually need one or two bosses and I hate to be an ass and drop a group after getting what I want. <br />
<br />
Yeah so you are either understaffed, ignoring tickets, or incompetent. I hope its not the latter, I have seen you pull some amazing acts of justice (see Ashes of Alar story from about 2 years ago) and almost every encounter I have had with a GM has been pleasant even if I did not get the answers / actions I wanted. So please stem the tide of toxic players that destroy this game.</div></div><hr />

NO your comments in the example are vague and could totally be clearer. MS&gt;OS is vague and meaningless and does nothing because nothing is spelled out. Master Loot means just that they are master looter and can change rules anytime they want, don't want to worry about don't do anything if master loot is on.</div></div><hr />

I'd have no issues with it being default if they made it smarter. There is no conceivable reason why I would need the same exact set of bracers, no bonus stats, 4 times in a row. Bonus rolls currently work this way and it's frustrating as hell.<br />
<br />
But in terms of pugging...man. Good luck finding a run where everything isn't reserved already, but then, if you join a master looter group be ready for drama.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What if someone is playing an OS for the sake of the pug raid?<br />
What if someone is playing their mainspec, but states that their MS is something else because they want gear for their other spec?<br />
What if someone is overgeared and in there for transmog gear only?<br />
What if someone is overgeraed and in there for warforged/socket chance on tier only?<br />
What if someone considers both, or all three of their specs their &quot;mainspec&quot; because they are all geared and played equally?<br />
What if someone is rolling for a clear downgrade, but technically it is still their &quot;mainspec&quot;?<br />
What if the ML actually uses some good judgement to not give loot to someone who was a cancer to the group and intentionally tried to cause wipes?<br />
What if someone who doesn't need loot comes in and makes it clear that he's going to roll for a friend in the group?<br />
<br />
The whole reason Blizzard doesn't step in is because there are so many grey situations, where there isn't a clear right or wrong. MS&gt;OS is incredibly vague.<br />

Master Loot means just that they are master looter and can change rules anytime they want, don't want to worry about don't do anything if master loot is on.<br />
<br />
....It's not clear? MS&gt;OS means that people who need it get it before people who are gearing a secondary spec. Before Blizzard stopped caring, taking a piece of loot while you're the master looter without letting people roll would get you suspended. You're obviously part of the problem. Hell, you're probably one of those dicks who ninja gear while you have ML</div></div><hr />

MS&gt;OS is incredibly vague.<br />
<br />
Like I said, they can still define it. i.e.:<br />
<br />
&quot;From this point forward, Blizzard GMs will take 'MS &gt; OS' to mean the following...<br />
<br />
1. Your main spec is considered to be the spec you are playing at the time of a boss's death<br />
2. Your off spec is considered to be your currently-learned secondary spec (so DPS/healer can't take tank gear even if their class has a tank spec)<br />
3. Highest roll wins with the exception of players who already have the item<br />
etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, if people disagree with Blizzard's definition, they'll have to come up with a new definition to use, but in most cases the above definition would be sufficient.<br />
<br />
I also don't think it's fair for a PUG to say &quot;oh, I'll switch to heals if you need, but I still want to roll on DPS gear&quot;. You either accept the role you were allocated, or you re-queue.</div></div><hr />

Why not? People in semi-guild runs do it often, so why not the pugger? <br />
<br />
If they're willing to do a spec they may not prefer (or might already be geared for. They could be running to gear their OS) why should they then have to take only healer loot? Especially when healers can sometimes be hard to find.</div></div><hr />

I mean this expac proved they are plenty willing to simply decree 'you'll do it this way and you'll like it' and this seems like a no brainer. <br />
<br />
No more ninjas, largely eliminates guild drama over loot, loot funneling would no longer be a thing (admittedly not a problem per se but I'd sure find the mythic race more interesting if there were a few guilds participating outside of the ones who are able to schedule multiple full clears in week 1). And on Blizz's end it would likely lead to people subbing for longer and get a longer lifespan out of a raid.<br />
<br />
Personal Loot should never be forced on those who don't want to use it, but doesn't mean it can't be encouraged. Personal Loot is great for dungeons &amp; shit for Raids imo. I think it would be best if given the choice of either, but also add in a barrier to prevent ninjas, when the RL wants to change the loot system everyone in the raid has to agree almost like a Ready Check. A RL can run his group as they please, but you dislike the rules than leave the group as than people can't complain about ninjas when they agreed with the change, a barrier for both RL &amp; Group member. Now this would only be for groups made from the premade group finder, Any RL/GL outside of it would have full access to changing loot rules as they pleases.</div></div><hr />

Yeah a you can only gain this after killing Archimonde at least once, but I gather they had their reasons for doing this which I would think give people a reason to log in and continue to cap their points after they have upgraded everything..

I used to be a firm believer in &quot;if you get ninjaed, GMs will punish those who did it if you report it&quot; until it actually happened to me. I was in a flex SoO-pug where the loot rules were stated MS&gt;OS and highest roll wins (at least one of those rules should apply right). The healing trinket dropped from Sha and me and another healer rolled. I won the roll. The ML then gave the trinket to a mage in the group (same guild as himself). Both me and the other healer questioned this in the chat and the raidleader said &quot;I gave it to the wrong person&quot; and then he and the mage left the group.<br />
<br />
Seemed clear to me that this was ninjalooting. Even if MS&gt;OS is &quot;vague&quot; a mage has no use for a healing trinket and it was also stated that &quot;highest roll wins&quot; and the mage didnt roll at all. Add to that the Raidleader even admitted he &quot;made a mistake&quot; even if that was clearly BS. I made a ticket about this also stating that I would understand if I couldn't be given the item I had won but that I at least wanted some &quot;justice&quot; to show people who do stuff like this that there are repercussions. <br />
<br />
The answer I got was basically that master-looters are masters of the loot and they can give items to whoever they seem fit, they might state &quot;loot rules&quot; in the chat but that doesn't mean that they can later &quot;change their minds&quot; and since they are loot masters they are &quot;in their full right to do so&quot;.<br />
<br />
Lost all faith in blizzard clearing up issues like this after that and I think twice about joining groups with ML after that. The fact that they added PL in legion (especially to raids as an option) is great for PUGs and the only loot type I accept nowadays if I can't run with a group I trust.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly, LOTS of guilds suffer from this drama. Just because yours hasn't doesn't mean it's not an issue. <br />
<br />
I really agree with just eliminating Master Looter, it's fairly toxic towards the game. I mean the LFD groups are a cesspit of players ninja looting, guild groups taking advantage of it by just replacing people who QQ about the loot being stolen and instantly replacing them.<br />
<br />
I've seen my fair share of loot drama, even while I was hardcore raiding with Fatboss, not with our guild specifically, but with other competing guilds at that time. <br />
<br />
Personal loot only needs a SINGLE change to make it viable, which is, Smartloot. This makes it so you can't get the same item twice, unless you have deleted or vendored the original item. Please baby Jesus, fix this ASAP Blizzard &lt;3</div></div><hr />

How is that unfair?<br />
Do you know what IS unfair? Starting raiding mid expansion and not being able to compete on DPS because I'm 20 ilvls behind the rest of the raid on my legendary ring.<br />
<br />
Btw, I really hate this model of &quot;play whole expansion to get legendary&quot; as it is very restrictive on swapping classes mid xpac if your raid happens to have plenty of something and missing something else...</div></div><hr />

Surely it's better than not getting it at all, like before when you needed to have killed Archimonde.<br />
<br />
You can also easily do some LFR as well, even Highmaul and BRF gives Valor now,and with Baleful gear a Mythic Dungeon might as well be an Heroic. They just slightly hit harder, no new mechanics at all; so that's 300 Valor there. Add in a Draenor Dungeon event, and you get Extra Valor, and a Heroic Cache as well.<br />

If you can do all sources of valor in a given week, you get 4875 valor, so you can get 3 upgrades in the first week, and 4 in the second. If the only valor source you can be bothered to get is the 100 daily from random heroic, then that is on you, as there's plenty of other content to do for valor (weekly event quest from your garrison(except pet battle weeks), LFR wings in BRF/highmaul/HFC and mythic dungeons).</div></div><hr />

Only exceptions are Archimonde raids for ring upgrade that I simply don't need any loot from. Gearing alts has never been easier and most importantly hassle-, ninja-, and dramafree. Between heroic HFC pugs, bonus rolls and crafts alts usually get fully decked out in BiS or near BiS heroic gear in about 3-6 weeks, with maybe 1-2 items of slightly lower quality. PL is the best thing added to PUGing, ever. People who cry over getting gold every single boss make me giggle. With bonus rolls it's fairly easy to prioritize most important items, even run some bosses several times per week and use more bonus rolls if missing that one special item.<br />

Also we were just talking with a guildie about how great it would be to get ring upgrades for valor this monday, great timing :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Skill? What skill are you talking about? The Crystallized Fel will be sold only for those who ALREADY OBTAINED THE LEGENDARY RING, which means you can now grind valor to upgrade your offspec (not sure for main spec) ring instead grinding one crystal fel only each week which takes 20 freaking weeks...5 months!!! That takes no skill...it's just boring and tedious. At least now it will bearable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Count Zero</div><div class="date">2016-01-05, 03:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like I said, they can still define it. i.e.:<br />
<br />
&quot;From this point forward, Blizzard GMs will take 'MS &gt; OS' to mean the following...<br />
<br />
1. Your main spec is considered to be the spec you are playing at the time of a boss's death<br />
2. Your off spec is considered to be your currently-learned secondary spec (so DPS/healer can't take tank gear even if their class has a tank spec)<br />
3. Highest roll wins with the exception of players who already have the item<br />
etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then, if people disagree with Blizzard's definition, they'll have to come up with a new definition to use, but in most cases the above definition would be sufficient.<br />
<br />
I also don't think it's fair for a PUG to say &quot;oh, I'll switch to heals if you need, but I still want to roll on DPS gear&quot;. You either accept the role you were allocated, or you re-queue.<br />
<br />
Leads to fewer successful pugs, as fewer people will be willing to switch to offspec in order to make sure boss dies.<br />
<br />
For example, my DK is MS tank and my Priest is MS healer. I only go into anything either with the idea I'm rolling on tank gear, or I'm not getting anything (like if I'm there to help someone else gear up). I have no problem DPSing with either if that's what we need, but I'm still rolling on what I signed up as.<br />
<br />
Are you seriously saying you'd rather a group fall apart, with no one getting any loot, than for someone to switch to heals but still roll on dps gear (and only if it happens to drop) ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's their way to get raiders back into it. They know that nobody can have multiple maxed out rings. However, the raiders queuing for valor stuff aside from a daily heroic or a mythic dungeon here or there has GREATLY diminished. They need a carrot for people, and this made the most sense given what we've been given. Really, the solution to keep people doing it longer should have been to put a cap on valor between 1-2k, but also allow normal-mythic to award valor too. I for one am okay with it, I don't plan on upgrading my tank ring at all aside from archimonde kills, but I am finishing my DPS ring now with it since I missed about six weeks of upgrades since getting my ring.</div></div><hr />

There is no Strength trinket with a ton of mastery that is an agility users bis.....so either he's lying or it was a trinket that had str outlined for him with a grayed out agility and agility outlined for the agility user with strength grayed out.

If I queue for a group that has anything on reserve (even if it only says one thing) and get invited, I immediately ask what's on reserve. Typical response is it says in the window. I then typically find a way to word it so they say everything that is actually on reserve. Typically I avoid those groups in general, but have had good luck with a few. As a whole I think the Group Finder is a disaster for many reasons. People reserving loot is usually not one of them.<br />

<br />
You can get three upgrades per week if you do absolutely everything....the exact number is 3.9 upgrades per week...At the end of a four week month it is 15 upgrades...It takes 20 weeks to fully upgrade the ring after obtaining it. So it won't take months, but it will take a few weeks. It SUBSTANTIALLY increases the speed at which you upgrade your ring. This is also based on not killing archimonde...if you kill archimonde every week you can basically fully upgrade your ring in a month. So yes it would take &quot;months&quot; to upgrade every ring from the original ilvl, but most people who have an OS ring have started upgrading that by now. Or if you're still upgrading your MS ring you're probably close to the cap unless you started really late. <br />
<br />
I don't disagree with what you're saying but stating it will still take months is a farce. If you're upgrading all rings from 735, yes it will take a few months but most people have something going as far as the upgrade process on their rings. The only people it truly sucks for is someone who plays a druid or paladin and plays all the intended specs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really agree with just eliminating Master Looter, it's fairly toxic towards the game. I mean the LFD groups are a cesspit of players ninja looting, guild groups taking advantage of it by just replacing people who QQ about the loot being stolen and instantly replacing them.<br />
<br />
I've seen my fair share of loot drama, even while I was hardcore raiding with Fatboss, not with our guild specifically, but with other competing guilds at that time. <br />
<br />
Personal loot only needs a SINGLE change to make it viable, which is, Smartloot. This makes it so you can't get the same item twice, unless you have deleted or vendored the original item. Please baby Jesus, fix this ASAP Blizzard &lt;3<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that the &quot;Smartloot&quot; that you're looking for is kinda being added in. If you have an equivalent item for that slot, you can trade the item to anyone else eligible on that boss. So if you have the same item looted that you already have, you can just give it away. (Assuming I've understood the change properly)</div></div><hr />

Nobody really cares about what you quit raiding. Don't need to get all high and mighty to your &quot;friend&quot; much less the others here.<br />
<br />
As for your related? You must have zero Inns/Taverns or not know how to vendor or put items on the AH, because 300k gold from garrisons on 11 characters isn't even mildly impressive... I understand your point about how easy it is, but get off your high horse, seriously, you sound like one of the few guys in the world who can explain what their own dick tastes like. You wouldn't even have 11 toons if vanilla grinding was still a thing, much...much less raid on said toons, not to mention that all gaining more gold across a player base does is cause inflation, which, at least in the realm of WoW, allows for fixed cost items to effectively become cheaper while everything else just scales up (assuming a relatively stable market).</div></div><hr />

Most of the players (including myself) just go AFK through all LFR Valor farms, its cancer for me, its cancer for others, why cannot I earn Valors by doing Normal Mode+, but instead I am &quot;forced&quot; (casuals rage inc) to do most useless (as for me) part of the game?<br />
<br />
Short message for future complain, yes I am &quot;forced&quot; beacuse I play for competition and I want my characters to be best possible (race/spec/GEAR etc) so if I want to get my alt's ring to 795ilvl as fast as possible, then I can say I am &quot;forced&quot; to lick the weekly aids, commonly known as LFR.</div></div><hr />

Master Loot means just that they are master looter and can change rules anytime they want, don't want to worry about don't do anything if master loot is on.<br />
<br />
I cant tell if your serious. So in your opinion master looter means I have complete control of all loot in the group and can give and take what I wish to whom I wish?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly what it means and how it should remain. If you don't trust the person in charge don't join a master loot raid. Personal pugs exist and if you can't get into one start your own.</div></div><hr />

What spec counts as MS and what counts as OS, whether it is the spec you are asked initially to fill or a predetermined spec that the player chooses, can easily be clarified. And the fact that even when there is no ambiguity, no mid-raid respeccing, no claims that MS is anything but the spec the player actually used, and still GMs refuse to enforce the rules shows how they are completely out of touch with how players actually want to play the game.<br />
<br />
If people want to run MS&gt;OS, they should be able to do so with GMs enforcing the rules against ninja looting. And the fact that devs don't implement this as an actual looting system in the game, despite it being the most common looting rule in PuGs, also shows that they too are out of touch with how players actually want to play the game.<br />

I see that GMs are still as ignorant and obtuse as ever.</div></div><hr />

So if I create a ML raid listing and state MS-OS, I have every right to take whatever gear I want and to give the others out as I see fit?<br />
<br />
This is my point. If the raid is listed as [ML] or [Guild first] or [X-Z res] then cool, You have stated that anyone who joins accept the rules in exchange for your leadership/lockout/etc. If a raid is list as [MS-OS] then how is it acceptable that the ML can take whatever they want, breaking there own loot rules and not be a ninja/toxic player?<br />
<br />
You cant have it both ways, you cant lie when stating your loot rules and expect no punishment, you cant waste other players time and energy and be ok with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also NO ONE does PL heroic raids. Why give the game a chance to give out 0-? pieces of gear, with no options of transmog or offspec (without changing your main spec) when you can get a guaranteed 2-6 with ML.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is forever telling us how great Personal Loot is.<br />
If it's so damned great, why don't they remove other loot structures?<br />
Exactly. It's not that great. It's fairly &quot;stupid&quot; in the allocation of loot.<br />
<br />
Why remove it when honest people/guilds can use it. <br />
Which is better, chance the loot gets taken or at least a fair roll of the dice?<br />

MS-OS is just ordering specs. There is nothing in MS-OS that says you have to /roll or that the closest to 100 wins. Yes it's common sense that you mean that but the moment there it any question in it, there goes any fairness. Yes there are people out that that don't know what ms/os is.<br />
GMs don't care about MS-OS, they care that there is no actual agreement as to how someone will win something. <br />
<br />
As for saying it in raid. I sign up for dozens of raids at a time, I could be invited to countless sets of rules. saying it in game makes a proper record of it and other players learn wtf is going on. <br />
<br />
PL was changed months ago. It is guaranteed to drop gear if there are eligible people in the raid. <br />

<br />
I find it hypocritical to laugh at people for feeling badly about it when those that laugh either do it from the comfort of their 13/13m progress or they don't take raiding seriously. In the first case, they would care that their mythic kills are &quot;gimped&quot; but they don't have that problem anymore so they can accuse others from the comfort of their position. In the latter case it's a topic that shouldn't concern them at all to begin with, since the ring is a raiding item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't understand what they're saying. Blizzard does not recognize &quot;MS&gt;OS&quot;. It's a meaningless statement that players invented for themselves before private loot existed. The loot rules the raid leader set through the interface is the only rules Blizzard recognizes and supports. It doesn't matter if the RL says it in chat, that's urban legend that it protects you. The RL setting Master Loot is the ONLY thing that counts. <br />
<br />
The players abusing this know this - and are counting on you counting on a irrelevant statement by them will protect you.<br />
<br />
I think the only time Blizzard will step in is if the raid is personal loot, and at the last boss the RL switches to ML without telling anyone. I think. Blizzard pretty much washed their hands of dealing with loot disputes when they came out with personal loot. <br />
<br />
The only way you can stop these jerk players is to not do runs with Master Loot on, period. That's what Blizzard is implying heavily at you.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
If they consider &quot;MS &gt; OS&quot; to be vague, perhaps it's time for Blizzard to define it, instead of leaving it up to the players to explain what it means each time a new person joins the raid.<br />
<br />
It's not a Blizzard rule, never has been. Players invented it. Blizzard has never in my memory supported nor enforced MS &gt; OS. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is being pretty clear - don't use Master Loot unless you trust the other players.<br />

Master Loot is the only rule that counts, in Blizzard's eyes. Everything else is your issue, and you're expected to handle it yourself. Which is why they tell people to use personal loot. <br />
<br />
It's not really that hard to understand. &quot;MS &gt;OS&quot; is something invented by raiding guilds to handle alts on guild runs, back in vanilla. Blizzard has nothing to do with it. They may have informally supported it at one point over the years, but they're straight out telling you they don't support it, yet everyone is still insisting they do. <br />
<br />
If you raid with master loot on from the beginning, the RL has 100% control of the loot. Granted, there are cool players who don't abuse it - but you have to understand, if a pug is set for ML, more than likely it's a player purposely setting it to abuse YOU, and you're allowing it. These players know they can get away with it, regardless of what they say in chat - Master Looter is the overriding rule. <br />
<br />
If you want MS &gt; OS enforced, find a guild who uses it.</div></div><hr />

So you could enter a master loot group but choose to receive loot through the personal system instead. Then the amount of loot that drops is determined by how many people can receive it from master loot. Sure, leaders may request members that only want master loot and complain if people don't select it, but that only makes them look shady.</div></div><hr />

What? I ONLY pug heroic Hellfire raids on PL this way I never get any ninja'ed items and there is no drama except for the that morons cry about getting gold. First you must have been in hibernation but PL was changed to ALWAYS give loot. Not only that PL will drop MORE loot than ML now to make up for the fact you can't trade among raid members.

The only people running ML heroic Hellfire are scumbag ninja looters or entitlement reservers. Neither of which I will ever join.</div></div><hr />

It is overwhelmingly the most popular player-invented loot rule.
