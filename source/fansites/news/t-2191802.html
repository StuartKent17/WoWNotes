Mythic Keystone dungeons now award gear up to item level 890 at keystone level 10, and now award gear up to item level 905 in the weekly Challenger’s Chest (at keystone level 10).<br />
Artifact Power rewards from both Mythic Keystone dungeons and the weekly Challenger's Chest now continue through keystone level 30.<br />
Mythic Keystones can now direct you to Lower Karazhan, Upper Karazhan, and the Cathedral of Eternal Night.<br />
Artifact Power rewards for Mythic Keystone dungeons have been adjusted:<br />
<br />
Longer dungeons, such as Halls of Valor, now award a proportionately higher amount of Artifact Power.<br />
Shorter dungeons, such as Maw of Souls, now award a proportionately lower amount of Artifact Power.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Changes<br />
Patch 7.2 makes changes to many classes, including new Artifact Traits. As always, Icy-Veins (http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/class-guides) has updated class guides!<br />
<br />
<br />

Class MountsclassMount<br />
Check out all of the class mounts on our Class Mounts page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models)! Unlocking these mounts is a reward of the eleven week quest campaign that comes with the patch. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6265-Patch-7-2-PTR-Build-23436-Class-Mount-Models&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/classMountsB.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;World of Warcraft Class Mounts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
New Mounts<br />
Class mounts aren't the only new mounts coming in the patch! New PvP mounts, reputation mounts, dungeon, and raid mounts are also being added.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/newMountsB.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6482-World-of-Warcraft-Patch-7.2-New-Mounts) <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact Changesartifacts<br />
Patch 7.2 adds new Artifact Traits, new Artifact Knowledge ranks, changes Artifact Trait costs, and more! See our Artifact Changes page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6485-Patch-7.2-Artifact-Changes) for all of the details.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2 adds several new traits for players to earn. These are unlocked by a short quest line that varies based on your role. <br />
The previous final trait with 20 ranks now just has one rank. <br />
Excess Artifact Power in the previous final trait will be refunded.<br />
The first new trait you purchase helps to make up for the loss of the old final trait, as it grants 10% damage and 10% Stamina. <br />
Each of your 3 rank traits will have another rank unlocked, allowing you to purchase up to a maximum of 4 ranks.<br />
A new final trait (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/239042-concordance-of-the-legionfall?artifactRank=0&amp;artifactRelic=0&amp;artifactCost=0&amp;artifactActive=0) has been added, this time with 50 ranks. <br />
The new final trait is effectively a soft cap, as you will have trouble ever earning enough Artifact Power to max it out.<br />
<br />
<br />

Flying - Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Twoflying<br />
Broken Isles Pathfinder, Part Two (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11446-broken-isles-pathfinder-part-two) was added in Patch 7.2! According to the latest developer interview, it will probably be a few weeks before anyone has earned it. You won't be able to complete Defender of the Broken Isles (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/11544-defender-of-the-broken-isles) until invasions activate a week after the patch releases. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion Invasionsinvasions<br />
The Legion's presence continues to grow in Patch 7.2, with invasions occurring around the Broken Isles. <br />
<br />
<br />
The invasion begins with a zone being under attack. The skybox, world quests, and the NPCs present are changed in some areas, similar to the pre-expansion invasions. <br />
The invasion quests are similar to the regular world quests, requiring you to kill NPCs and click objects.<br />
After completing all six invasion world quests, you have completed the Assault on Zone quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-patch=23436&amp;filter-daily=1&amp;filter-search=Assault), allowing you to move to the next stage.<br />
Next you are sent to a specific point in the zone to defeat more invaders, with some similar followup quests.<br />
After all of these quests are complete, there is a three player invasion scenario that sends you to the Legion ship in the sky.<br />
On the ship you defeat various NPCs before defeating the leader and taking down the ship. <br />
<br />

Legendary Item ChangeslegendaryChanges<br />
Legendary items are getting some modifications, bad luck protection is becoming spec specific, and you can (somewhat) target slots for legendary items in Patch 7.2!<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion Legendary items now require level 101 (was 110).<br />
Patch 7.2 makes legendary drop bad luck protection more spec specific.<br />
The system looks at how many legendary items you have that can drop for your spec, so if you switch specs the system will know how many legendary items that work for that spec. If you don't have any for that spec, you will have a higher chance to get one.<br />
The crafted legendary items don't count against your legendary bad luck protection.<br />
You can target a specific slot for legendary items with the Relinquished tokens (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=relinquished) from the Broken Shore.<br />

<br />
PvP Brawl: Gravity Lapse - Every minute, players on the battlefield will find themselves launched into the air, only to gently fall toward the ground once more in a perpetual aerial ballet as they try to accrue enough resources to take the win home for their team<br />
PvP Brawl: Southshore vs. Tarren Mill - Originally introduced as a part of the World of Warcraft 10-Year Anniversary event, this Brawl harkens to the early days of WoW PvP with an epic battle between the two towns of Tarren Mill and Southshore<br />
PvP Brawl: Warsong Scramble - You can capture your enemy’s flag without your own at base. There are a few more power-ups to the field of battle to stir things up a bit. To win, your team will need to be the first to capture 5 flags<br />

UI Changes<br />
You can see the full list of UI changes in the official notes, but we've highlight some of the more important ones below! <br />
<br />
<br />
The Blood of Sargeras vendor now sells items in multiple amounts (Shift-click).<br />
The calendar now shows ongoing events (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/ongoingEvent.jpg) when you hover over a day.<br />
Vendors now grey out the price (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/currencyGrey.jpg) when you don't have a sufficient amount of currency. <br />
On PvE servers, players of the opposite faction now have orange names (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/orangeName.jpg).<br />
You can now assign a specialization to an equipment set (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/transmogSetUI.jpg) in the Equipment Manager.<br />
An &quot;Open All&quot; button (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/openAll.jpg) has been added to the mailbox.<br />
You can now search your Appearance Collection by dungeon name and boss name.<br />
In Arenas, your enemies' crowd control Honor Talents are now tracked on their unit frames.<br />
Pet spells can now be dragged onto the player action bar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Addons &amp; Friendly Nameplates in Dungeons and Raids<br />
With Patch 7.2, we’re disabling the ability for addons to modify the appearance of friendly nameplates while inside dungeon and raid instances.<br />
<br />
While, for the most part, we’re impressed with -- and encourage -- the creativity that addon authors bring to the game using the addon API, occasionally an addon goes too far in terms of automating or trivializing elements of gameplay that are meant to be highly challenging. Recently, we’ve become aware of a couple addons that were using visual adjustments to friendly nameplates as a method to automatically coordinate complex positioning requirements. This caused what was intended to be a difficult test of a group’s ability to identify positioning requirements on the fly to instead become a simple matter of following a visual marker.<br />
<br />
In order to prevent this from continuing, we’ve had to disable the ability for addons to modify how friendly nameplates appear while inside of dungeon and raid instances. Nothing has changed outside of dungeons and raids – addons will still be able to customize the appearance of friendly nameplates everywhere else (most notably in PvP, where they’re most commonly used in ways we don’t consider problematic). <br />
<br />
We also don’t anticipate that addon authors will need to update their code to accommodate this change; customizations should simply stop working once a player zones into a raid, and start working again once they’ve left. However, if you’d like to double-check, this change should now be active in the current 7.2 PTR environment.<br />
<br />
Just to reiterate since I'm seeing some confusion:<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing whatsoever is changed while you are outside of a raid or dungeon When you zone into a raid or dungeon, only your friendly nameplates (if enabled) will be forced to use the standard Blizzard appearance Enemy nameplates can still be modified and customized by addons while in a raid or dungeon Once you zone out of the raid or dungeon, any changes made by an addon will once again apply<br />
<br />
<br />
Set Appearances Collection<br />
A new tab has been added to the collections pane that lists Tier armor sets and PvP sets.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can filter by PvP/PvE, as well as Collected / Not Collected<br />
Different raid difficulties and PvP difficulties are separated<br />
You can search for dungeon and boss names to list the sets that have pieces from them.<br />
<br />

But, is there going to be a 7.2.5 PTR?<br />
<br />
If there is, then damn...<br />
<br />
I really wanted to see what Argus looked like by now...<br />
<br />
However, judging from how everything looks, Argus alone is ATLEAST 20% done in detail...<br />
<br />
Content alone is like 4% done...<br />
<br />
So, yeah. I'd expect 7.3 to come on the PTR in like 3-4 Months, or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is better to overstate a time frame than to understate said time frame don't you think? I mean didn't you get mad when in the past they said okay we plan on doing maintenance from this time to that time and then when the time elapsed the servers were still offline, and you go to find out why and see they extended the maintenance..<br />
<br />
People would get seriously bent out of shape over that.. Also the time frame they have chosen people are either still asleep (depending on where you live), at work or at school..</div></div><hr />

<br />
It'll probably be done at or before normal time, Every patch in legion has finished early.<br />
<br />
Guess they're just learning that its better to overshoot and have your playerbase say &quot;Yay! It's done early!&quot;<br />
<br />

World quests, crafted gear, a few pieces of order hall class sets and probably a few pieces with nethershards from the broken shore shard vendor.<br />

That's my plan for the warrior I'm leveling :P</div></div><hr />

I've checked the calculators. Now my weapon is LVL 54 and it needed ~64 million AP. Now with ~64 million AP it'd be only LVL 440 Why do they take the LVL of the weapon back? It's just like they bring back my character to LVL 105, just for fun.... I hate the AP grind, and now I have to grind that 14 LVLs again, for much more then it was before. It's just a sh**t.</div></div><hr />

The AP put into those 19 ranks will be refunded as well as the 35th trait buffed to make up for the loss. Not sure how much the new traits cost though</div></div><hr />

So they increased the base item level of Heroic and Mythic dungeons but how will newer characters now obtain that new threshhold to qeue for them or join them ? World quest rewards will go up to 860, I don't even see the point of doing heroic dungeons atm except for quests (world quests, class quests, profession quests etc.), you get better gear from solo content anyway.</div></div><hr />

You mean just like in 7.1.5? Heroics dropping 825, WQs going up to 845? Did you just start playing the game today?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there is, then damn...<br />
<br />
I really wanted to see what Argus looked like by now...<br />
<br />
However, judging from how everything looks, Argus alone is ATLEAST 20% done in detail...<br />
<br />
Content alone is like 4% done...<br />
<br />
So, yeah. I'd expect 7.3 to come on the PTR in like 3-4 Months, or so.<br />
<br />
Well I mean thats fine. 7.2.5 will probably go up by the end of April at the latest, if not mid April. Last around 1-2 months, and then it will launch with Tomb coming either same day or soon after. 7.3 Ptr will probably start in July.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah. <br />
<br />
7.2.5 PTR will come the week after 7.2 launch, with release in Mid-Late April. 7.3 PTR is going to come the week AFTER 7.2.5. Ya know, just like all the other PTR's before-hand. :/<br />
<br />
I can expect The TOS raid to come when the 7.3 PTR pops (Meaning, likely May 2nd).<br />
<br />
Here's what I'm expecting:<br />
<br />
First Week of 7.2: We get to 5/15, we get our traits ready, yady yady yada.<br />
<br />
Second Week of 7.2: We get to 10/15, We do invasions, we get our Mounts, and more (Anduin Questline Also pops), 7.2.5 PTR comes.<br />
<br />
Third week of 7.2: We get to 15/15, We breach the Tomb, we wait 1-3 weeks until 7.2.5 pops on lives, Tomb arrives either May 2nd, or April 25th.</div></div><hr />

They also said in the last Q&amp;A that ToS would probably be tied to a .5 like balance patch.</div></div><hr />
