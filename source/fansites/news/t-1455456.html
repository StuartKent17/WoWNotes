Battle.Net Website Update - Warlords of Draenor Preorder Preparation<br />
Blizzard made a small update to the Battle.Net website on Friday to add design elements for the Warlords of Draenor preorder and Digital Deluxe edition upgrade. No preorder date has been announced yet. The level 90 boost feature is part of Patch 5.4.7, and the latest PTR Build is flagged as a Release Candidate. <br />

My upward 50-100K dmg differential on an attempt to attempt basis as Ele begs to differ...<br />
If you meant 50k-100k DPS, I'm very dubious of that being due to RNG. If you meant 50k-100k damage, that's negligible. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427020109681393664))<br />
http://t.co/NfMQmjh909 Logs to back it up. Look at both malk attempts. Almost same length, 40k+ difference. Not first time.<br />
You died on the parse you did 10% less DPS, and spent significantly less time casting. That 40k difference is not all RNG. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427699356087504896))<br />
Your recent comments like this one about rng make me feel like devs don't raid competitively or heroics at all<br />
I've killed every single 25H raid boss when it was progression, since AQ40. From BC to Garrosh. We raid. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/428664008376209409))<br />
The true question is : do you arena ? <br />
I dabble in it. I've gotten to 2200 once before, I think only like 1700ish the last few seasons; don't recall exactly. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/428680653475835904))<br />
I'm much more of a PvE focused player myself, but we have other team members who are equally focused on PvP. Team effort. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/428680879997583360))<br />
<br />
I think making more abilities talents that you can choose: active vs passive. Would be a good way to keep/trim at same time.<br />
Yeah, an interesting point. How would everyone feel if that ability we wanted to cut but you want to keep became a talent? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427531947573641216))<br />
Abilities you'd want to cut are NOT worthy of being talents unless you put them on a non role increase row.<br />
Of course, we wouldn't put a utility spell on the same row as throughput talents. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427537071356391424))<br />
We're keeping in mind that cutting abilities people don't have keybound anyway doesn't buy us as much. Far Sight, Mind Vision, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427536541942964224))<br />
Not promising that any ability you don't have keybound is safe, but it's less likely. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427536820683816960))<br />
<br />
what happens to the current talents we love? Or the blizzcon ideas...<br />
We may also cut some existing talents that aren't working; could replace them with these abilities. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427534161373446144))<br />
<br />
I'm afraid you'll cut too many and turn this game into GW2 or another 8 button action bar game (which I can't stand).<br />
We're keeping feedback like this in mind, very much. The goal will be to remove unneeded buttons, not dumb down the game. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427532815198998528))<br />
I'm afraid you won't cut enough buttons. <br />
I'm certain that some people will say we cut too much, some will say we cut too little. Very difficult to balance. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427529575665381376))<br />
(Or, we cut to little, but what we did cut we shouldn't have.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427529680170659840))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Which race for the model update is proving to be the most artistically or technically challenging to implement?<br />
currently the Orc female is giving us a hard time - never realized how much her mouth looks like Homer Simpson's mouth. (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/428586668539400192))<br />
Hm wasn't that the orc female in the trailer? Or you mean in general with customization?<br />
trailer version was an earlier take of the model, wasn't completely happy so iterating more on the face/body texture (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/428644166491328512))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
I could really use one right now, undermanning SoO. Need alcohol to deal with all these 1-tank strategies haha<br />
Craziest one I heard of was 1-tanking Spoils. /boggleReminds me of 1-tanking H-LK. What a rush! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427035346115637248))<br />
I've 1-healed Spoils before, that was fun actually. I'm not sure I understand 1-tanking! How does it work /headtilt<br />
They all do one quarter, then swap sides, do both quarters, then swap sides, do last quarter. Lotsa teleports back up top. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427036099857235968))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
how about you try better. Give us blue collar guys a Friday treat. New season ilvl perhaps..?<br />
550, happy friday! (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/426811339575525376))<br />
How about new ceiling?<br />
It will steadily increase over the course of the season to 540. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/426864839416225792))<br />
Are you implying that 6.0 will come 28 weeks after season 15 starts? Or doesn't the 1 item level/week rule apply?<br />
Yeah, not implying anything of the sort. It will reach 540 at a point when we think many people have 550 gear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/426878262317314048))<br />
<br />
How are you going to avoid damage being way too high in the next season when people will have 550 ilvl ?<br />
We've increased resilience. We can increase it again if necessary. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/426864615318777856))<br />
<br />
Any word on how crafters will obtain the patterns for the next line of crafted PvP gear next session?<br />
There will not be a set of crafted PvP gear for the new season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/428257745590956032))<br />
<br />
when will we get to see the new armor for S15 arena?? Wanna see how good the priest will look??<br />
Season 15 armor is a color shift of Season 14 armor. Unfortunately, we weren't able to create new models for the season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/427545826101956608))<br />
PVP S15 Conq Gear, so the gear will look like the opposing factions Grievous in game now? (Ex: Ally get red)?<br />
Yes (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/428592965380870144))<br />
<br />
is the elite gear for season 15 still going to be the same color?<br />
Unfortunately yes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/428352473854517249))<br />
<br />
Will we get a new pvp mount for S15?<br />
Unfortunately, no. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/428351187943829504))<br />
<br />
s15 pvp dropped from celestial? what about a new content pve with this season??? (raid tier etc)<br />
Dropping another tier of PvP gear is a trivial time investment for us, compared to a whole new raid tier. Focusing on WoD. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/427172040110784512))<br />

No? The season is ending on the 18th of February, and ESO is launching on the 4th of April. They're not going to delay 5.4.7 that long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your big game coming out next is going to be Reaper of Souls, that's only gonna be 10 days prior to ESO's release. <br />

<br />
Not really because blizzard was lazy as hell this new arena season they didnt even bother updating the last season expac gear because it would take too many resources. They could have easily done at LEAST a color change but instead they just swap the colors between horde and alliance that are already there. Its simple as changing items you can buy for your faction and putting them in the vendor.. ultimate lazy mode. If they had to add the crafting patterns it would be too much work and take away a possible raid tier in WoD Kappa</div></div><hr />

Then why does it feel like we saw way more at the MoP announcement than Warlords? I guess they had two starter zones done or something? I didn't watch it, but that was pretty much it wasn't it? The models which have been advertised as a selling point aren't finished, allegedly. And after blizzcon it seemed like we got a pretty steady supply of information. All we're getting lately is just teasers it seems. And even those are biweekly at best.</div></div><hr />

I guess they had two starter zones done or something? I didn't watch it, but that was pretty much it wasn't it? The models which have been advertised as a selling point aren't finished, allegedly. And after blizzcon it seemed like we got a pretty steady supply of information. All we're getting lately is just teasers it seems. And even those are biweekly at best.<br />
<br />
I think we actually got several shots of up to 5 zones in the trailer if I'm not mistaken.</div></div><hr />

It's always resembled it, if you weren't so focused on two small parts of an expansion - which sorry to burst your bubble, will also be in WoD - then you'd see that. I'd say grow up, but it sounds more like you're just trying to be some super-manly guy and having &quot;Pandas&quot; and Pokemon in a game somehow make you less manly. Pokemon was awesome, I still watch the shit out of that and I'm willing to bet MOST people born late 80s/early 90s will still hold nostalgia over it. Pandaren, just go play Warcraft and stop making yourself look silly.</div></div><hr />

This comment made me think. It might be a stupid question, but I'm wondering now if the paid 90 boost and the free 90s on preorder will happen at the same time? Probably? Probably not? Am I overthinking? Underthinking? LOL (I guess in my head I just assumed they'd be at same time, but when someone actually asked me that question I was brought up short. &quot;Of course! Um... yeah. Maybe? I don't know now that you mention it...&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well i guess WoD release june 24th so they give you 3-4 months to play with your new 90 and a blue dev said about the 90 pre order that it will give you time to maybe even get your legendary cloak which does take some time.</div></div><hr />

A beta is not a free demo. If all they want/need to do is stress test, that's all they have to do. They don't owe it to you to let you try out their game for free for days/weeks. That you would send them angry emails about it like you're somehow entitled to it is laughable. I'm not trying to be combative, but.... really??? xD</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pharsidez</div><div class="date">2014-02-10, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The pvp vs pve talents have been a big &quot;meh&quot; to me. I think it is really broken. This brings up a lot of good points that I'd like to see, but also some bad ones. I'd rather see a tree for each class that is separate for pvp. So it would be something like a dual spec for pve, then a third for pvp. And the pvp tree would have different specs, such as more utility and damage reduction, vs. a pve tree that's more specialized on tank/dps/healing. When you enter a BG or arena, it would switch to the spec. Or if you're in a pvp zone, you can manually activate that spec. I used to hate having to give up a tree because I needed a pvp spec.<br />
<br />
I also feel like the desire to limit the amount of buttons for classes would take away form the game instead of enhance it. They do need to do something about the millions of buttons we have to remember on our action bar. He said that they don't want to make it an 8 button game like GW2, but over 20+ buttons is ridiculous. My shaman easily has over 30 because we can't just drop totems anymore (4 at a time), so that added a good 7 extra filled slots. I hope this is not a bad idea at making all classes standard, as if some require more than others! If a player finds it to difficult to play a certain class they should reroll a class that better suites there own play stay! Otherwise it threatens force changes on all of us to suite some of us.... food for thought poeple!</div></div><hr />

They could have easily done at LEAST a color change but instead they just swap the colors between horde and alliance that are already there. Its simple as changing items you can buy for your faction and putting them in the vendor.. ultimate lazy mode. If they had to add the crafting patterns it would be too much work and take away a possible raid tier in WoD Kappa<br />
<br />
You guys haven´t figured out, this is a filler season. They only added it because they didn´t want the current season to last 3 more months, and they didn´t want to go 3 months without any season. It will be shorter than other seasons, so just relax.</div></div><hr />

Almost all games have ´beta weekends´ now. Not defending TESO because I think it is a terrible game ( very clunky combat), but you do realize that there is more to beta testing than doing quests? Two of the most important things are system configurations and stress testing. I wouldn´t question their ´business practices´ for doing something basically every other MMO has done for 5 years and is testing they need to do to make the game better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I probably wasn't clear. I know the free &quot;pre order&quot; 90s and the paid boosted 90 store option come out before WoD release (like you said, so people can take those new characters and play with them a bit to get used to them, gear them up, etc.), but the question was do these thing happen at the same time, or not necessarily?<br />
<br />
If the patch (5.4.7) goes live on 2/24 does that mean the paid 90s become available that day? Or might Blizz hold off on that (not the patch itself, but the store option) because they want the paid 90s to become available at the same time pre-orders open up (which we don't have an official date for yet). They'll probably do these both at the same time (whenever that is) ... right? Or do people think that these 2 things are mutually exclusive?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. There is no guarantee that paid 90s go live with the patch, and a fairly significant point of evidence that they will not, specifically the fact that they are not mentioned in the official patch notes at all. Blizzard is likely just getting the necessary infrastructure in place to activate them later at the appropriate time. I doubt we will see paid 90s before the pre-orders open up, and that will not be for a while. <br />
<br />
Also, Patch 5.4.7 will be here on the 18th, not the 24th.</div></div><hr />

When I see beta, I am prepared to give feedback on multiple areas of the game, I understand network stability is important. I just think they should have labeled it as such in my email, it got me all excited for nothing.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with insider knowledge. Blizzard has never offered a pre-order for any of their titles without first announcing a release date. We are nowhere near getting a release date for WoD. Thus the pre-orders will not be available for some time.</div></div><hr />

It is the new version of the Annual Pass. If you sell WOD now, and give away a free 90 for a pre-purchase of the game, you not only give players something new to do, play with a 90, but you lock them into playing WOD.</div></div><hr />
