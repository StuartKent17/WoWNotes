New Guild Services Now Available<br />
In a nutshell:<br />
<br />
Guild Master Faction Change costs $40 US.<br />
The Guild Master Realm Transfer costs $35 US.<br />
The Guild Name Change costs $20 US. <br />
You will receive a $10 discount when purchasing Guild Transfer and Faction Change in the same transaction, for a new total of $65 US.<br />
<br />
We are in the process of adding new guild services that will make relocating to a new realm, switching factions, or changing your guild name easier than ever before. Relocating your guild to a new realm or faction with this new service will keep your guild structure intact, including the guild leader, guild bank, ranks, and guild name (depending on availability). You won't even need to pack. <br />
<br />
Guild members who decide to relocate with their guild may initiate their own paid character transfer. Upon a successful transfer they will automatically be part of the guild when they first log into the new realm. Their guild rank and guild reputation will be intact.<br />
<br />
Guild leaders who do not want a change of scenery may also choose to pick a new guild name using another new service.<br />
<br />
As a part of the process for adding these new services, we are launching on a single realm (Illidan-US) to perform additional testing for stability and functionality. We expect to be able to add additional realm availability to the service, including EU realms, in the coming days and weeks.<br />

World of Warcraft Guild Services FAQ<br />
<br />
Q. What are the guild services for World of Warcraft?<br />
A. Three guild services are available: Guild Master Realm Transfer, Guild Master Faction Change, and Guild Name Change. These services can only be initiated by a character who is a Guild Master.<br />
<br />
Q. How much do these services cost?<br />
A. When purchased individually, the Guild Master Faction Change costs $40 US, the Guild Master Realm Transfer costs $35 US, and the Guild Name Change costs $20 US. You will receive a $10 discount when purchasing Guild Transfer and Faction Change in the same transaction, for a new total of $65 US. In addition, one Guild Name Change is free with the purchase of either a Guild Master Faction Change or Guild Master Realm Transfer. All sales of guild services are final -- no refunds will be given once a purchase is made.<br />
<br />
Q. Do taxes apply to these services?<br />
A. Players in select states in the U.S. may be subject to taxation when using a guild service. This includes but is not limited to:<br />
<br />
New Mexico<br />
Texas<br />
<br />
<br />
Q. Aside from being a Guild Master, are there any other requirements for the character that initiates a guild service?<br />
A. The Guild Master must meet the same requirements governing the equivalent character-level service (such as Character Transfer), including being at least level 10 (except for Guild Name Change) on an account in good standing. View the Character Transfer FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20558) or Faction Change FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=28825) for more details.<br />
<br />
In addition, the Guild Master's Battle.net account must be protected by a Battle.net Authenticator or a Battle.net Authenticator that has been active for at least three days (starting at the time of the first Authenticator-protected login to the game) before a guild service can be initiated. If additional security-related requirements apply to your character, they will be brought to your attention when you initiate a guild service.<br />
<br />
Q. Are there any requirements for the guild to be able to undergo a guild service?<br />
A. A guild must be at least level 2 to undergo a Guild Master Realm Transfer or Faction Change. There is no level requirement for a Guild Name Change.<br />
<br />
Q. How do the two &quot;Guild Master&quot; services work?<br />
A. When performing a Guild Master Realm Transfer or Guild Master Faction Change, only the Guild Master character transfers realms or switches factions. The Guild Master takes the framework of the guild as well, including the guild vault, level, perks, and achievements.<br />
<br />
Q. What happens to my guild members?<br />
A. Your guild members remain in the original guild. The original guild will be reset to level 1 and will not retain its guild bank or any of its achievements, reputation, or progression. You will also select a new Guild Master from the guild roster to replace you after your character leaves. Your guild members will be eligible to follow you to the guild’s new location by performing their own character service (such as a Character Transfer (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20558)). If they do so, they will automatically rejoin the guild and retain their guild reputation.<br />
<br />
Guild members who plan to transfer to the guild’s new location should not quit the original guild – otherwise, they will not regain their guild reputation after transferring to guild’s new location.<br />
<br />
Q. What happens to my guild bank, level, and so on?<br />
A. The guild bank, level, perks, and achievements transfer with the Guild Master character to the new realm and/or faction.<br />
<br />
Q. Will individual members’ guild reputation be retained when they rejoin the guild?<br />
A. The Guild Master character will retain his or her reputation after transferring, and guild members who decide to transfer will regain their guild reputation when they rejoin the guild at its new location. However, there are two notable exceptions where this does not occur: if the guild member transfers realms before the Guild Master, or if the guild member quits the guild on the original realm before transferring realms.<br />
<br />
Q. Is there anything that doesn’t transfer with the Guild Master?<br />
A. Besides your guild members, the only thing that doesn’t transfer is your guild rank structure. You will have to reassign ranks at the new location.<br />
<br />
Q. How will my guild members know when this happens and how to follow me?<br />
A. After a Guild Master service is complete, your guild members will receive an in-game mail with instructions on how to follow you. They will be directed to Battle.net account management to initiate their own character service(s), which will need to be purchased separately. This process will be streamlined, so options such as the destination realm and/or faction will be preconfigured.<br />
<br />
Q. Will there be an out-of-game notification of a guild realm transfer or faction change?<br />
A. No, the only notification will be the in-game mail delivered to your guild members.<br />
<br />
Q. How long will a player be eligible to follow a Guild Master after a realm transfer or faction change?<br />
A. There is no time limit on following a Guild Master to a new location, as long as the guild member does not leave the current guild before Guild Master Realm Transfer or Faction Change is complete. If a guild member leaves a guild that has moved to a new location, or joins a new guild, the member’s reputation with that guild will be wiped after 30 days.<br />
<br />
Q. Are there any requirements for a guild member who wants to follow a Guild Master Realm Transfer or Faction Change?/<br />
A. The guild member must meet the requirements of the character service they are undergoing (Character Transfer or Faction Change), including being at least level 10 and on an account in good standing. For the complete list of requirements, refer to the Character Transfer FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20558) or the Faction Change FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=28825).<br />
<br />
Q. How long does a guild service take?<br />
A. Under normal conditions, a guild service takes one to two hours to complete, but please allow up to several days.<br />
<br />
Q. Is there a cooldown period for guild Realm Transfers, Faction Changes, or Name Changes?<br />
A. The cooldown periods for guild services are the same as their related character-level services. For more information on these services, please refer to the Character Transfer FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=20558) or the Faction Change FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=28825).<br />
<br />
Q. What happens if I transfer my guild to a realm where my guild name is taken?<br />
A. If your guild name is taken on the destination realm, you'll be prompted to pick a new name for your guild during the realm transfer process on the Battle.net website.<br />
<br />
Q. Can I customize my character and name when doing a faction change?<br />
A. Yes, the same character customization options offered in the Appearance Change service are included in a Guild Master Faction Change.<br />
<br />
Q. I'm ready to move my guild! How do I initiate a Guild Master Realm Transfer or Guild Master Faction Change? <br />
A. Before initializing a guild service, make sure you've created a Billing Profile. (Learn how (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article/27045) to create one.) Step-by-step instructions on performing a guild service can be found here:<br />

Player Housing<br />
Player housing, like the dance studio, are nowhere near the ballpark of pet battles in terms of development time. This goes back to the final point I made in my original post. You can't just put a huge list of features on an equal timeline and decide which to throw out. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/204089/pet-battles-and-development-time) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3424796689?page=5#92))<br />
<br />
Faction Balance in the WoW Storyline<br />
I know I did talk about this subject when Cataclysm was the fresh, hot topic. I don't remember what my exact words were, though, and would love to read them again after seeing several people bring them up in this thread.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure I never made any specific point that an equal amount of story and retribution would be dedicated to the Alliance in Cataclysm, because I was well aware of how most of the story would play out. The Horde made many more grabs for power and dominance when Thrall left. Then Thrall became the protagonist with the evolving story of each patch focusing on the efforts to defeat Deathwing.<br />
<br />
The stories of the villains in the expansions so far have had pretty direct closure, but that's never been the case for the two player factions. And one shouldn't expect it to be with the conclusion of any expansion. Things will continue to change and there will be an ongoing tit-for-tat between the Horde and Alliance. If you start the story at Warcraft I and move forward, that's evident. Leaders have changed. Cities have been destroyed. New cities have been created. Land has been gained and lost. The races who have allied with either side have changed.<br />
<br />
It's going to keep going and we have no ambitions to decisively make one faction less interesting or cool than the other. That's not a good design philosophy for two playable factions and it doesn't make for a flourishing story.<br />
<br />
But you will win some and you will lose some. And the wins and losses won't be at equal intervals for both sides, aligning with the release of each patch or expansion. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/204003/theramore-in-flames-horde-favoritism-pt-2) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3430805957?page=28#553))<br />
<br />
Pet battles? Why?<br />
We do add features to the game often based on concepts players have expressed interest in. But in order to dedicate ourselves to making epic games, we also need to spend a lot of time and resources anticipating what gamers of all walks of life will find fun. That's how all of our games thus far have been created. While our design decisions for any game will always be met with mixed reactions, we couldn't be respected in our industry if our approach to game design is always reactive.<br />
<br />
You made it clear you don't like the idea of pet battles. It seems there's a decent chance you won't enjoy them when the system's released either, though there's no sense in conceding that absolutely before you try it -- no matter how convinced you are you'll hate it. But, as was said multiple times by Game Director Tom Chilton at BlizzCon, we want more content systems and forms of progression in the game so our extremely diverse playerbase has a lot of choices over what to spend time doing for fun, accomplishment, socializing, a challenge, etc.<br />
<br />
I guarantee you a lot of players are really going to love this feature. It's going to be an engaging mini-game that actually has quite a bit of depth and progression, just not in the traditional sense of increasing your character's power. That shouldn't always have to be a driving factor in our content. As the OG players have said countless time before, Southshore and Tarren Mill world PvP battles didn't become popular because there was a tangible reward incentive. The majority of World of Warcraft systems and content, particularly at level 85, are currently directed at enhancing a character's power. While that won't fully change, we want to continue creating new avenues to make that happen as well, such as is the case with adding a third, more accessible raid tier with the Raid Finder, or adding PvE Scenarios to facilitate the quick formation of smaller groups to take on a series of event-driven quests.<br />
<br />
But Pet Battles and Dungeon Challenges are very different. With one, you're actually getting a use out of the pets you've collected over the years, in order to progress them in a fun mini-game, unlock countless more pets, and just generally give your character a new depth of style and flavor. Similarly, Dungeon Challenges are difficult 5-player dungeons which really allow you to push your skills and PvE small group coordination to the limits. They'll scale, so the better you do, the better you're rewarded and ranked. That gives your character a new measurement of PvE progression prowess and bragging rights. Plus, you can earn exclusive set designs which are purely aesthetic -- to be used with Transmogrification -- which, again, give your character a new depth of style and flavor.<br />
<br />
It's about giving people options in the game to play it how they want to. We have a lot of people playing, so with almost seven years of World of Warcraft on the market, we want to continue innovating features we believe people will enjoy experiencing in this game. And a hell of a lot of thought, discussion, debate, and iteration at Blizzard goes into this stuff, mind you. :)<br />
<br />
To address your overarching point a little bit, the way various development resources are expended on creating features for the game is extremely complicated and very unique to each project. That can't be explained in a way that will be fully understood by the community at all times, in all situations. While I understand your point is that no resources should be spent on pet battles, you're really not in a place to make a well-referenced argument about what features in development are taking time away from others you feel are more pertinent.

<br />
This is in best case scenario, though. If the guildmaster and 3 of his/her friends just takes the guild and runs off, then... well, I guess you're paying down a cash bet against Blizzard to see if you can get your stolen guild bank restored back to the members and get banned.</div></div><hr />

What would happen if all the Paid Services were free? Everyone would be Faction Changing, Name Changing, Server Xfering, Guild Faction Changing, Guild Name Changing, Guild Server Xfering, Character Customization every time they could... That would totally destroy their Servers and would destroy the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you can see from one of the blue responses, the development of such features takes a 'currency' that we'll call 'dev time'. <br />
<br />
Dev time has to be allocated to be spent on different things that people in different interests have been asking for. You can't stretch Dev time to buy 3 things for the price of 1. They chose 1 thing, and the 2 other things that people have been jockeying for have been put off for an unknowable amount of time.<br />
<br />
People are upset because the pet battle system is a feature that, frankly, people see as an activity that does not fit in with the scheme of this MMO, and feel that the Dev time could have been spent on other features that does more for the immersion and assistance for pre-existing functions/features in the game (such as, for example, Guild/player 'housing'/'home instances').<br />
<br />
The issue that people have (although not worded as thus, but this is what the heart of the complaints hit at) is that it's such a side niche of interest appeal that it really is something that stands far apart from the other features of the game and could ultimately wind up serving a very small audience that does not justify the amount of dev time that was invested in it compared to other features that could've been.</div></div><hr />

Are you changing servers that often with your guild then? Just asking, cause I am totally not in touch obviously. Same guild, same server for 7 years.

All it does it transfer one character and a guild structure. Previously before all this guild leveling crap, all you used to do was pay for a transfer, then create a guild charter on the new realm. No special guild master transfer needed that costs extra money. It's costing more money to do the same thing people used to and you claim its &quot;cheap&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You kinda overlooked the fact that every player has to pay for himself/herself as extra. The price indicated is for transfering guildmaster, guild bank, guild name and guild perks. ALL other guildmembers have to pay 20 euros each.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. <br />
<br />
It's ridiculously expensive and makes me feel embarrassed that a company I use to respect is trying to get away with more and more of these over priced fees. A much more realistic expense would have been $65-100 for the entire guild to transfer or faction change. Add on top of that a $20 guild name change (which was offered for free before!!) and it just serves to highlight the extent of their greed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but wouldn't it make more sense for Blizz to give us the option of mass transferring our toon with the guild at a reduced rate? <br />
Our guild has 400+ mains and alts, on a fairly dead server. Not everyone can look at transfering 4 or more toons at $25 each... you're talking up to $200 if you've got a full list. <br />
<br />
As it stands, to transfer our entire guild is going to cost upwards of $10,000 (400+toons x $25) and that is just insane<br />
<br />
I'd like to see them offer this service as is, but offer each account the option of mass transfering each accounts toons for a flat fee of like $30 or $50, just to make it more viable...</div></div><hr />

They could always put a cap on the amount that can transfer, say 200 or so.<br />
<br />
The way they're doing it now, Blizz is asking for over $5,500+ for even a small guild of 100 players... that's fair right?</div></div><hr />

Im sure &quot;Dev Time&quot; would most likely be used to install a couter measure for that. Something along the line of (a) would only allow poeple that have been in the guild for x amount of time to trasnfer with it and (b) a guild that has been around for x amount of time plus x guild level. Its not over complicated and im sure they can find the &quot;Dev time&quot; to add that in. as per the actual charge for this great thing, i see somewhere around the $100 to $200 fee. depending on amount of guildies and what not. that way you would get only guilds that have serious members moving with you and not just some clown who joined 3 seconds ago.</div></div><hr />

It's going to keep going and we have no ambitions to decisively make one faction less interesting or cool than the other. That's not a good design philosophy for two playable factions and it doesn't make for a flourishing story.<br />

This - in fact - is a valid point. They should offer a discount for all chars who were at least 3 months in the guild, maybe 5 or 10 Euros for a transfer instead of 20, or all characters of the account that were in the guild for the price of one character. This would prevent fake guild tranfers, because why should someone be willing to pay for the guild transfer and to invite some stranger so they can transfer cheaper?</div></div><hr />

I can understand no one paying the GM if say, it was a giant guild full of people who were just randomly invited and full of 12-year-olds, but there's quite a few guild groups that are adults that are friends iRL that would chip in money to help move a guild off of a server to a new one.</div></div><hr />

Don't like it? Don't use it. For all of you whining that this service is just lining Blizzard's pockets, keep in mind the proceeds go back into paying for the creation of this service to begin with, as well as maintaining it, as well as paying the Game Masters that have to fix things when baddies use it incorrectly or maliciously.<br />
<br />
All the naysayers these days seem to forget that the money they pay for their game goes right back into the game, helping create new content, more services, etc. I suppose it's expected that a company shouldn't be interested in making money though, and that everyone should be working for free.

I honestly don't care about QQ. I just want for once in my life for the complaints to be made by people who are fully aware of how things actually work in this game and what goes into making it. The vast majority of the complaints and even some DEFENSES of the features are made by people who think that WoW is run on a giant box that sits in the middle of a room in Orange County CA, and every tuesday Ghostcrawler walks up and gives it a little shake like a Snowglobe to make the servers reset; then Mike Morheim pulls a drawer open at the base of the box and grabs a fistfull of hundred-thousand dollar bills and runs off with it to buy a giant pile of cocaine.<br />

I just want for once in my life for the complaints to be made by people who are fully aware of how things actually work in this game and what goes into making it. The vast majority of the complaints and even some DEFENSES of the features are made by people who think that WoW is run on a giant box that sits in the middle of a room in Orange County CA, and every tuesday Ghostcrawler walks up and gives it a little shake like a Snowglobe to make the servers reset.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, that's something you'll likely never see become reality, not with this crowd. It's easier to complain than it is to educate yourself, and we live in a world where leisure is king.</div></div><hr />

Do you really think this automated service is some how labor intensive for Blizzard? Other games offer these type of services for free, fyi. If you cannot recognize that you're being charged a silly amount for an automatic service that many other games offer freely, then I have nothing else to say to you. I just don't know how anyone in their right mind can consider a small guild of 100 people having to pay over $5,000 dollars to transfer as reasonable or fair. That's not reasonable in the least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You, as well as the overwhelming majority of people whining about additional services being added have no grasp of the dynamics that go into services like these. Between the combined realm/faction change and these new guild services, Blizzard is entering into completely new territory with services that are leaps and bounds more complicated than a simple realm change or name change. With added complexity means more things that can go wrong, more initial investment into making it happen to begin with, and more complicated procedures for the GM team supporting it.<br />
<br />
They have a price for a reason, you don't like it, you don't have to pay it. Let the others who are willing and interested in enhancing their own gameplay do so, because these doomsday rants about a company having a vested interest in making money and protecting their bottom line gets old.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just don't know how anyone in their right mind can consider a small guild of 100 people having the option to pay an individual fee per user to transfer as reasonable or fair. That's not reasonable in the least.<br />
<br />
Fixed that for you. The primary difference (on the user's end) between this new service and the old way of manually transferring each and every character is that in this format, you retain your guild setup and reputation. If an entire guild truly wants to transfer, they were going to do this already anyway. This service just removes the inconvenience of creating a new guild, organizing the bank, reinviting everyone, and losing reputation.</div></div><hr />

Entitlement is a great, stupid thing. In the famouse words of so many people in these and other forums around the world... if you dont like post, dont reply to it and move on. As far as that guild transfer/faction change, charge whatever they deem right. The guild name change went from free to $20. That alone goes to show where Blizzards &quot;Dev Time&quot; is going, More money, less then optimal work.</div></div><hr />

You think these 'automatic' services just run on nothing? Don't take time to maintain? Don't use resources? Don't cost money? Lots of businesses run with the majority of their products having very low margins. In order to make a profit, which is the right of every business, they will charge higher margins on the smaller 'minority' products in order to increase their profits so they can make their 'majority' products more affordable to more people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just because 100 people are grouped together in a video game, doesn't mean they are entitled to whatever they want to do in said game.<br />
<br />
When we all signed up to play WoW, we knew the costs, the limitations, and the same goes for being in a guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you really want to move, gquit, move, and carry on.<br />
<br />
<br />
But if you REALLY want to move your whole guild, all characters, all accounts, etc., well, then you have to pay the fee that Blizzard is charging.<br />

How many guilds have done this same thing beforehand at a much higher cost and started from scratch anyways. The whole thing is a service of choice for players to use. Does not matter if you use it or not, for many will. And what other game companys do for free has no bearing on what Blizzard desires to do. Would have been nice to have said service before now when many players and their guild mates wandered to a new server to start fresh, taking their guild bank away on their backs and rebuilding up again. The cost is about the same, just now you can move the whole guild bank and all your hard earned work with you as well. Yet regardless what Blizzard does... good for some, not add in a feature they wish to be in game for others(player housing for what reason? to hide in your own closet instead of just sitting idle over SW/Org on your mount?) ... people will rage and fill up the forums with multiple posts on Blizzard sucks rotten eggs.</div></div><hr />

Either that or you are looking for a more competitive server.Previous options:1. Have everyone xfer their toons to a new server ($25 each toon) and start a fresh guild.2. Join another leveled guild on that server which you now have little/no control over3. Be lucky enough to have a friend who has a high level guild in-which you can control 4. Have everyone make completely new toons (Nothing to do with guild really but no cost)Options now 1. Be able to keep your guild as a whole and carry everything you have on your current server for $40 more...ONLY $40 to keep everything!!If you have a well established relationship with the people in your guild and your progression/competition has run out of options this is a very cheap cost imo. BTW, if $65 is a &quot;small fortune&quot; to you (That's the cost of a standard game now days). I think it might be time to close out WoW, Reevaluate your life, and make some better financial decisions.</div></div><hr />

Ha, you actually think Blizzards pricing is reasonable, nothing more to do but laugh, the point is how Blizzard can get away with such outrageous prices is really bad.

This service is an entirely automated process that no doubt has paid for its development many times over. A service that Rift with a player base that is an order of magnitude smaller than WOWs can offer for free.

The system needs to be set up so that it leaves behind a &quot;shadow guild&quot;, like when you move a thread from one forum to another, you can leave a copy of the old thread behind.<br />

This would prevent a guild leader from transferring a level 25 guild to a new realm and just leaving behind a bunch of players with no guild at all.</div></div><hr />

Instead of making it free just like that, make it like this. Sends X guild members a invite for a guild server change, 20 euro each server change (current price). If you get Y players you'll get the guild transferred for free. <br />
<br />
I mean sounds like a plan. I'd rather use those 65 dollars on a nice night. Ye right my ass, wow is cheaper than going out.. 12.99 euro a month puh. 120 days played total since vanilla on all my characters and used probably above 7 faction change, 12 server changes, 2 race change and 1 name change. Also bought subscription, vanilla and everything. Do the math and you'll be better off drinking / having fun with friends..<br />

Wait so blizz offer a service they didnt before and people expect it to be free? it has no effect on gameplay, it gives no direct benefit, and it is in ADDITION TO THE GAME. Yeh shouldnt be covered by monthly fee. Well Would be nice I guess if it did, but if it was free wouldnt people abuse it? just wait for their guild to hit a lot of gold and transfer?<br />
or Top Guilds would just use this to jump to low pop realms for realm firsts?<br />

It's almost as if Blizzard reluctantly offered the option to something they previously said they can't and/or won't do, as long as they profit off it.I almost feel bad for all the people that started a new guild, leveled it off the ground, invested a lot of time etc etc, all because they inherited a guild with a shitty name. Kind of a slap in the face to add a $20 price tag... I'd be all for the use of a week-based (or even month-based) CD instead.</div></div><hr />

Put up or shut up. Don't much care about guild perks and your gbank? Reroll. People have been moving as a guild en masse since the advent of the server transfer, with disposable income to spare and server firsts to ninja.

I'm amazed at the amount of people who wholeheartedly accept this type of thing without a second thought. Those automatic services do not cost anywhere close to $55 per person. <br />
<br />
And it's not about entitlement, it's about the alarming amount of &quot;fees&quot; Blizzard keeps levying onto their consumers that have no basis for their costs. There is nothing wrong in asking for a second look at this pricing structure, or at the least, for guild members to receive some sort of a discount.<br />
<br />
<br />
I accept it because I am paying to play their game. I have no right to this game, no right to certain fees, no right to advantages.<br />
<br />
This is Blizzard's game. They can charge accordingly.<br />
<br />
If their prices are too high, they will lose subscribers just like Netflix did when they raised their prices.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you do not like Blizzard's services, simply cancel your account and move on. No one is forcing you to play Blizzard's game.</div></div><hr />

AND THEY ARE CHARGING AN ARM AND A LEG FOR IT! it's hilarious how you people try to justify the price for a feature that probably took at most 8 hours of developer time and is fully automated. Also developing costs of it were covered with the subscription fee and that concept seems to be extremely hard to understand, at least for the majority.<br />
<br />
Let me ask you, would you either take paid guild transfer or player housing? both require developer time and both are funded by subscription fee.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never once said it wasn't a huge flat payout to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
They charge the fee that they deem necessary. Yes, there are costs to maintaining such a system. Are these costs cheap and are probably recouped and then some by the charges Blizzard is assigning to this new guild feature? Absolutely.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, it is their game, and they are pricing it how they want. There are ton of products out there, a ton of FREE products out there, if you don't like what Blizzard is offering. Cancel and take your money elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

first of all if you change server there is a 90?(30?) day wait time untill you can get realm first, it has been like that sens ulduar. also blizzard is bleeding users left and right, i know i would play WoW again if i could play with my friends but i aint paying for somthing as basic as moving my guild or char sens i might be on a shit server.<br />
<br />
as for &quot;gold farmer&quot; abuseing this i don't see it sens almost all of the gold sold these days are from hacked accounts so where the gold it dosen't really matter they have so they can sell you any time<br />
<br />
this is not about gameplay but about playing with friends, let's be honest here you don't play WoW for it's &quot;amazing&quot; content, no you play it sens your friends play it, your friends is WoWs content</div></div><hr />

Why would they charge for changing the name of a guild? That's just silly. I've personally never really been fond of having to pay for any such services (faction change/realm change) but now they're really crossing a line with me. I know that I wont ever use this thing out of principle. How can they be this greedy? These types of services should be included in the 10 euro per month that we already pay them. Fix it Blizz!<br />
<br />
I would think they charge for it so is discourages people from doing it too often. If its free then every week or so you would change your guild name or transfer the guild to another realm. On a seperate note I'm not going to be putting much in the guild bank from now on, thats all I need is to put stuff in a guild bank and find out next week i'm guildless and all the stuff I just donated went to another realm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think Blizzard's pricing is reasonable. So I am not going to use their guild change services. It is that simple.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard, 3 months from now, finds out that their estimates and revenue they thought they were going to get with this service is below their forecast, it is highly likely that they will lower their prices to entice more people to use the guild change service.<br />

Even if you only take 2 people and their guild for a realm change, you are already saving money! Two server transfers would cost you 40 bucks already.<br />

But that is the beauty of it. If more and more people leave, Blizzard will adjust accordingly and start offering services to entice more subscribers (i.e. content and new/fun gameplay)<br />
<br />
It is my belief that that point is coming very soon. They know it too. With new games coming out, WoW being so old, their new '12 month' lock-in price feature, they know what is happening. Blizzard is far from dumb; they wouldn't have lasted this long if they were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, but if the stranded guildies are that upset about the GM's actions, all it takes are a crowd of freshly made lvl1s on the new server to ruin the guild's (including the gm's) name. Although it really is a dick move on the GM's part, I don't think he'd be let off that easy.<br />

Whats the reason for this requirement? As long as im willing to pay, shouldnt I be able to transfer my lvl 1 guild if i wanted? I was looking forward to this coming and transfering a guild to server i got my mains on But now, unless i get it lvled to lvl2 with 1 char in it, thats gonna take some time... For those wondering, got a bank char as Guild Master, wich im currently lvling (60+ atm) No gold in there, but got all tabs paid for and a unique name and couldnt be arsed to make a new one so this lvl 2 rule is just stupid...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would prevent a guild leader from transferring a level 25 guild to a new realm and just leaving behind a bunch of players with no guild at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's pretty much what it does. When the GM moves, they have to elect a &quot;new&quot; guild leader among the remaining guild members, and then that guild becomes a level 1 guild where all the current members stay. The GM takes the level 25 guild with them wherever they go.</div></div><hr />

You keep forgetting one important fact. You and me, us, we have the power. The consumer has the power. Sure you all can scream and yell all you want to persuade Blizzard to lower their prices. It has happened before in the world (see Netflix keeping the company together and not splitting).<br />
<br />
The power though is in your subscription. If you don't like what the company is doing, take your money and go elsewhere. If enough people do it (just like enough people screaming and yelling - i.e. Netflix), Blizzard will change their minds and adjust accordingly.<br />
<br />
No one is forcing you pay these fees or continuing to pay their subscription fees. You are making that choice and by making that choice you know full well what is / is not available to you in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One point I would also like to point out here, that no one has touched on, maybe Blizzard doesn't want people using this feature? Supply and demand. If you charge high enough price for it, no one will buy it. Maybe Blizzard doesn't want everyone and their mother changing their guild names 24/7 or server transferring all the time? MMOs are supposed to have a community type feel and that community feel on realms has been eroding for a very long time. Allowing guilds to move and rename themselves all the time would further weaken that community feel that makes every MMO great.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe this is why Blizzard is charging a high price? To keep the usage to a minimum. But still allow those that REALLY want the feature the chance to use it.</div></div><hr />

I don't really expect anything free, I live in the real world. But after paying Blizz 5 years worth of subs, and all the expansions at full price. I don't think its asking much to get some sort of benefits for free, even if they have to be on a long CD to stop the service from being abused.<br />
<br />
I know people that race change almost every week, because they get bored with there characters. This more then anything is why they charge for the service, and have no CD. I would love to see the numbers on how much cash they rake in off there services, and mount / pet store.</div></div><hr />

No one is forcing you pay these fees or continuing to pay their subscription fees. You are making that choice and by making that choice you know full well what is / is not available to you in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One point I would also like to point out here, that no one has touched on, maybe Blizzard doesn't want people using this feature? Supply and demand. If you charge high enough price for it, no one will buy it. Maybe Blizzard doesn't want everyone and their mother changing their guild names 24/7 or server transferring all the time? MMOs are supposed to have a community type feel and that community feel on realms has been eroding for a very long time. Allowing guilds to move and rename themselves all the time would further weaken that community feel that makes every MMO great.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe this is why Blizzard is charging a high price? To keep the usage to a minimum. But still allow those that REALLY want the feature the chance to use it.<br />
<br />
Part of the problem here, is that WoW has become so big and successful of an MMO that they do not have any direct competition to steal players away from them. We are mostly stuck dealing with whatever fees they decide to lob at us until an equal caliber MMO finally comes along and offers something competitive and reasonable for players. I hope that GW2 and SWTOR can be successful enough to offer those options, because at this point I really feel Blizzard is abusing and taking for granted their subscription base.<br />

You may feel they are taking advantage of their subscription base, and in due time (if this is really happening and enough people feel that way) their subscriptions will fall and those people will go elsewhere.<br />

You just proved the point. There are no alternatives that are equal to WoW. You're stuck with the $55 fee whether you like it or not, and whether you use it or not. That doesn't make it right, and that doesn't mean people should not be upset over it.</div></div><hr />

A. After a Guild Master service is complete, your guild members will receive an in-game mail with instructions on how to follow you. They will be directed to Battle.net account management to initiate their own character service(s), which will need to be purchased separately. &quot; <br />

While its nice they finally added a way for GM's to transfer their guild or change their guild faction, the price tag on the Guild Name service is just silly.<br />
<br />
Back when I played on Arthas, I had the pleasure of gaming with a small casual guild who eventually opened a ticket to have the guild name changed. That's all it took, a ticket! And when the GM talked to the GL, it was changed seconds after speaking with him, no mass logout required, no price tag. So I remain dumbfounded as to why they're charging for such a service, when it was offered freely before, I highly doubt there is a huge flux of guilds waiting for a guild name change. <br />
<br />
They could of just as easily added an NPC in-game that would allow you to change your guild name for gold. :confused:</div></div><hr />

Because of the guild perk system you've basically forced people to spend extra money in order to keep their guild in tact. Before perks, it was better just to leave and start up the guild on a new server. Now you have to pay this stupid fee on top of the hundreds and hundreds of dollars your guild would have to spend to move on. Why should they get punished because their server has become a ghost town during your massive subscriber hemmorage?<br />

First as to the question of need and possibility. Why would a guild &quot;need&quot; to transfer and how is making it cost hundreds to thousands of dollars making it possible? It looks much more like it gives the ability for a GM to walk with a guild and all its possessions, including rank and perks, while the rest of the guild gets screwed. Its not helping anyone to charge such high amounts except Blizzard. Second, before you start insulting people perhaps you should have a check of your own mental capacity.

They could always put a cap on the amount that can transfer, say 200 or so.<br />
<br />
The way they're doing it now, Blizz is asking for over $5,500+ for even a small guild of 100 players... that's fair right?<br />
<br />
Yeah, it is. Previously, you couldn't transfer your guild. That's all that changed now. The guild can go with you. If a guild wanted to transfer in the past, all the members still had to pay for a transfer for each character. So 200 members would still be 25 dollars each (alts and all). Nothing changed here other than now you don't have to lose guild progress and dismantle the bank to transfer.</div></div><hr />

Yes Blizzard wants to make more money, what company doesn't? But it just seems so over the top, obvious and a blatant way to help make up for the nearly one million subscriptions they lost. Sad.<br />

That can't be explained in a way that will be fully understood by the community at all times, in all situations. While I understand your point is that no resources should be spent on pet battles, you're really not in a place to make a well-referenced argument about what features in development are taking time away from others you feel are more pertinent.so basically a big FU to the people who are against this in favor of things like the Dance studio that was promised Waaay back before wrath was released or better character models for player characters. Who the F was asking for pet battles and more importantly WHY were they asking for them? who are the ****ing DERPS thats suggested it in the first place? you want pet battles go play ****ing pokemon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first thing.. i would like to know where this wondrous land is where everything is free that you people seem to live in.<br />
<br />
secondly. it wouldn't be any different than before except for one thing. if a guild wanted to change servers before every player that wanted to move had to pay to transfer, but the guild would lose everything it worked for and have to start over. now you don't have to. so it costs money... big deal. get a job, or cancel a couple adult website monthly memberships.<br />

Agreed. <br />
<br />
It's ridiculously expensive and makes me feel embarrassed that a company I use to respect is trying to get away with more and more of these over priced fees. A much more realistic expense would have been $65-100 for the entire guild to transfer or faction change. Add on top of that a $20 guild name change (which was offered for free before!!) and it just serves to highlight the extent of their greed.<br />
<br />
your right. shame on a company making money off of their product.</div></div><hr />

Other games offer these type of services for free, fyi. If you cannot recognize that you're being charged a silly amount for an automatic service that many other games offer freely, then I have nothing else to say to you. I just don't know how anyone in their right mind can consider a small guild of 100 people having to pay over $5,000 dollars to transfer as reasonable or fair. That's not reasonable in the least.<br />
<br />
<br />
other games do not have an active customer base in the 8 figures region. other games do not have to employ thousands of GM's to handle the crap storm of tickets, complaints, and transfer requests. other games have to go freemium in order to give people a reason to play the game, and spend money in their online stores.<br />

if you don't like it then go play one of those other games.<br />

/facepalm<br />
<br />
I'm amazed at the amount of people who wholeheartedly accept this type of thing without a second thought. Those automatic services do not cost anywhere close to $55 per person. <br />
<br />
And it's not about entitlement, it's about the alarming amount of &quot;fees&quot; Blizzard keeps levying onto their consumers that have no basis for their costs. There is nothing wrong in asking for a second look at this pricing structure, or at the least, for guild members to receive some sort of a discount.<br />
<br />
i've played this game for six years, and i have never encountered any of these &quot;alarming fees&quot;. maybe because i have never changed my characters names, or sex, or faction, or server. if they tacted the &quot;fees&quot; on to everyone's account just in case they might want to use them at some time. then yes that would be an outrage. however using these services is not mandatory. so i just do not get where all of your rage is coming from.<br />
<br />
btw. how would you ever know what the cost is for blizzard for transfering characters across servers? i was not aware any kind of business would ever make such information public knowledge.<br />

Pretty sure the only thing I implied, which is to say, I came right out and said it, is that Blizzard is full of a bunch of greedy bastards. I can see that you are in support of greed and that's ok, greed is popular in America. Evidently not getting an education while also supporting their greed is popular, at least with you judging by your poor use of syntax and grammar in your post. At least you spelled everything correctly, spell check is a wonder isn't it?<br />
<br />
<br />
a sentence like that, and you are going to bash someone else's education level?<br />

so where is this country where everything is free? i'd really like to know.</div></div><hr />

Keep towing that line. I'm sure Blizzard is very happy with you. The price for these services overly exceed the actual expense and it's glaringly so. Why do people get so defensive when others point this out? Taking it so personal to the point as to insult people is a bit much. We do no one harm by asking for some reasonable fees, in fact, it's good for all of us. So unless you're a Blizzard shareholder, you shouldn't be so upset over asking for lower fees...</div></div><hr />

I'm not upset, you are the one posting 20+ posts about how 'outrageous' these prices are, and vigorously defending yourself and your opinions. You have no idea what the exact expenses are, so you are in no position to make sweeping assumptions like you have. And there is a large difference between 'asking for lower fees' and joining in the chorus of endless crying in a completely juvenile and uneducated way, eg. this entire thread.

It costs a ton to move a guild... My guild is on a dying server and it would cost in the THOUSANDS to move my mediocre sized guild off of a server that is slowly falling apart around us.....Here is a post I did on the official thread<br />
<br />
Edited by Oberoth on 10/26/11 12:53 AM (PDT)<br />
<br />
I am not one to post on these forums much at all. However as a GM of a guild, on a low population DYING server, I feel the need to speak about these changes.<br />
<br />
This service is going to be profitable no matter how you do it. However doing it in the fashion you are doing it eliminates many of the players that MAY use this feature if your pricing structure was different. <br />
<br />
The character that I am posting on is the GM of a guild. We were on Blackrock US. However when Cata came out the load times for that realm were idiotic. We were offered free transfers to the realm NazJatar US to help the population slam that Blackrock was getting. We checked out the realm and it was gaining a decent population from the free transfers coming in so we decided to swap servers. <br />
<br />
Honestly we felt VERY cheated (dare I say scammed) because instantly people were allowed to change back and we have had to slowly watch this realm start to die. We have carved out a home here, but it is slowly becoming more and more difficult to gain new people (since most of the decent people are already in one of the other decent guilds. There is no pug scene and the economy is shot too....<br />
<br />
Needless to say we were SUPER excited to hear about the upcoming guild services.... Until we saw them. The problem for us is that it is price prohibitive for our guild to transfer. So here are a few ideas that would make this better all around <br />
<br />
1.) Allow increased guild transfer fee, but a reduced per person fee. ($50 for guild+$10per character)<br />
<br />
2.) Allow bulk transfers at a discounted rate that everyone can opt into/contribute too via their own battle.net account. ($300 per 20 characters)<br />
<br />
3.)Allow an even more discounted bulk transfer with severe limitations. ($200 for 20 characters but only allowed 1 guild transfer per character per year or $200 per 20 character, but only one character per account can be transferred)<br />
<br />
All of these are much more price attractive to guilds. Please help guilds like mine which are stuck on what seems to be a dying realm. If you don't make some changes we would either have to stay on our current realm or LOSE a ton of members who don't want to swap servers... <br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR- No matter what you do you will make money, but by allowing a lower price point you would entice a HUGE number of other people to utilize this service. Not only is it likely to be a net monetary benefit for Blizzard it is a great PR move AND it helps your subscribers. <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skippert</div><div class="date">2011-10-26, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is rediculous, 35 dollars and on TOP of that, everyone needs to pay another 10 or 20 euro's for their personal character transfer, which I thought was already included in the damn price. The whole service is fully automated and there is not much data to be transferred. Apart from that, you pay that 10-20 euro to move ONE CHARACTER instead of all your characters in the guild. You may wanna do some alt-runs etc. Nope, pay another 10-20 euro's for Blizzard to move maybe 1 megabyte of information, which costs basically nothing.<br />
<br />
If all this was being asked for a free to play game without monthly subscription, that's acceptable to some degree, but this is a subscription based game that costs 11-13 euro's a month.. I should have the right to these automated services years ago, just like I can switch servers for free and ON THE FLY in RPG games and shooters that have more and more unique character features. This is not luxury, we pay luxurious amounts of money every month. These services should be baseline for all, with a really long cooldown.<br />
<br />
You see, the bigger the corporation (Activision) the more greed. If you wanna stand up for big corporations, sure defend Activision. I pitty you fool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's just a transfer from one database to another, with a few explicitly declared instructions on how to handle conflicts and the like.<br />
<br />
It's EXACTLY what happens when a moderator on MMO-C moves a thread from one forum to another. It was one place, now, suddenly, the entire thread and everything that happened in it - replies, time stamps, mod warnings, the works - is somewhere else. If the thread contains a poll and the forum its being moved to does not allow polls, well, that's the same as handling a mount difference and so on. Needless to say, it does not cost MMO-C money to move threads - let alone several hundred dollars. In the case of moving chars, no one even has to click a button - the system does it automatically when you pay for it.<br />
<br />
Databases have been handling these types of operations since they were created. At this point, it's such a profoundly BASIC operation, saying that it's 100% automated and 100% free doesn't require inside knowledge. It's hardly a trade secret.<br />
<br />
Their charging up the wazoo for this = &quot;screw players on dying realms who are having a terrible gaming experience, we can make money for doing literally NOTHING!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, you in no way have any facts to back your claim as to the cost of this service. Just because something is written and tested does not mean its costs come to an end. You still have support in place to ensure that when something odd happens that their is a proper response. Let alone the costs involved in rolling this out to production which includes the design, documentation, development, and testing, at all levels. Do you think these things are free? You are obviously not working in the software development field for any large established company where the product has minimal if no downtime expectations.<br />
<br />
It is an optional service, apparently crying isn't optional for some.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">randprin</div><div class="date">2011-10-26, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">what did i read here:<br />
guild master: &quot;yeah, my server is dead, there're barely any people to recruit, my raid crew just lost 2 players which means i have to try and pouch from one of the remaining 20 guilds that actually bother with pve, the last time i saw a rated battleground was somewhere in may and the guild is slowly disintegrating&quot;.<br />
<br />
(what should have been blizzard response): &quot;hmm, we need to merge a few of those semi dead servers to have some life injected into them again, or maybe allow guilds to transfer to more populated servers to give them better recruitment chances, or maybe allow people who want to be recruited into those guilds to transfer to those realms for free or somethin&quot;.<br />
<br />
blizzard actual response: &quot;pay us and we'll allow you to move your guild to one of the few overpopulated servers, you may be unwelcome there as you're just another drain on that servers resources but hey, we love your money&quot;.<br />
<br />
Edit: i had to edit this to mention one more thing, this change will mean there are no more free realm transfers, you realm to crowded? pay to transfer your guild and your players if you want less lag. your realm is dead, forget about the chance to get more players from those crowded servers.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc263ef0e2be</div><div class="date">2011-10-26, 12:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a lot of bullshit around in this thread, but here's my view on it.Blizzard, as a business, provide the game and services they do to make money. To make more money, they can do extra services like this. If players want to use them, they'll pay, and if not they won't. Don't like it? Don't use the service, or just quit even. <br />
<br />
If people are willing to pay those sorts of prices, then they are right as a business to charge those prices. If it turns out they aren't being used, the price will come down. Again, if it is not all right with you, take your money elsewhere.No one is disputing that they're expensive or money grabbing or greedy. They are, for an automated function on a server database. They should be cheaper. But they have absolutely no responsibility to charge any less than what they will sell for. None at all. Its the players who use them who value that service at that price - if they didn't, they wouldn't pay for them.<br />
<br />
Finally, a lot of people are complaining how much it would cost to move a 10, 50 or even hundred person guild. It could be in the thousands of dollars. But remember, it already cost nearly as much before. Before, everyone would transfer their characters, still costing thousands for a large amount of people. Now, the exact same thing happens, except the master pays a bit more to keep the guild intact. And yet hardly anyone complains about the character transfer costs, which you have either way.</div></div><hr />

The only people that have been acting juvenile are those misguided posters that start to name call and attack anyone who is dismayed over the fees... And yes, the services are overpriced. It does not cost anywhere close to $55 for a character transfer, not even if you include the development time for creating the service. But here, someone else outlined it for you as well:<br />
<br />
<br />
It's just a transfer from one database to another, with a few explicitly declared instructions on how to handle conflicts and the like.<br />
<br />
It's EXACTLY what happens when a moderator on MMO-C moves a thread from one forum to another. It was one place, now, suddenly, the entire thread and everything that happened in it - replies, time stamps, mod warnings, the works - is somewhere else. If the thread contains a poll and the forum its being moved to does not allow polls, well, that's the same as handling a mount difference and so on. Needless to say, it does not cost MMO-C money to move threads - let alone several hundred dollars. In the case of moving chars, no one even has to click a button - the system does it automatically when you pay for it.<br />
<br />
Databases have been handling these types of operations since they were created. At this point, it's such a profoundly BASIC operation, saying that it's 100% automated and 100% free doesn't require inside knowledge. It's hardly a trade secret.<br />
<br />
Their charging up the wazoo for this = &quot;screw players on dying realms who are having a terrible gaming experience, we can make money for doing literally NOTHING!&quot;<br />
<br />
So maybe you can calm down a bit now, and realize that people calling out exorbitant fees are not personally attacking you.</div></div><hr />

Is that this could have been presented in a different way. Add a guild transfer package (I already stated this) or some kind of group rate/discount and charge x amount for that. This is just way over-priced for a service that is not supervised by 3 elite programmers on a 24 hour schedule. And yes you dont need to use this to have fun in the game. But you need to wake up and see that this will lead to other things that &quot;are&quot; included in the subscription to become premium services. Remember the cross-realm real ID group premium fee they were talking about?And for those that love analogies here’s one for you. You drive from Boston to New York with 4 of your friends. When you get to the Toll-booth, the clerk tells you that its $20 for the vehicle to go through and you’re like ‘OK”. Then the toll clerk tells your friends that they each have to pay $10 to get into the city in your car that you just paid for?! :confused:</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Just no. <br />
<br />
Also I'm not QQing. I'm just pointing out the obvious even if you can't see it.<br />
<br />
If this feature was introduced with the Burning Crusade, the wow population would've laughed the developers right out the door. How things have changed...<br />

Excellent rebuttal, you ignorant retard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And you are incredibly stupid. If you think only 1% of the WoW playerbase can afford these changes, then you are even more retarded than you come across as. How often do you need to move your guild to a different server and/or change faction? I've been playing WoW for over 6 years now, and can safely say there has never been a NEED to.<br />
<br />
This is a LUXURY that wasn't in the game before, not a NEED. You people need to realise this is an online computer game, not a necessity of life. If you honestly can't afford this, then you need to readjust your life priorities before bawling at these additions.<br />
<br />
First of all, take a deep breath and calm yourself down. Done? Okay. I was joking. If you didn't get that, you're taking yourself and this game waaay too seriously. Second, it is something that few players will want to purchase. 1% of the population is probably too small but it won't be much more than that. I'm surprised it's even offered at all honestly. Lastly, I've been playing since release now as well. There's a ton more features now than ever such as faction/race changes, etc. This just seems clunky and akward. People can afford it no doubt or their parents can. From your insult at the start, I'd say you fall into the later category.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lamavras</div><div class="date">2011-10-26, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look guys, I'm tired of reading this back and forth. It's an optional service being offered. If you don't want to move your guild from one server to another, don't, but if you do and are still complaining about the single-payment price for an optional service while you can also afford the game consider this:<br />
<br />
If you want to change realms along with the guild that you and your members have worked so hard to get up to lvl 25, then it's going to cost a little extra compared to just changing servers and starting up a new guild because there's more data to transfer from one physical location to another physical location. It becomes somebody's job to actually transfer all of that data over and make sure that it's all done correctly and that everything fits and works (guild bank is still the right level, all the items are still there, the guild's rank in the server now has to be calculated...), and to make sure when other guild members are switching servers that their characters are switched properly and that they get put into the correct guild, with the same guild rank as before. Blizzard has to pay that person for doing his job. If they didn't offer character transfers, Guild transfers, faction changes, race changes, sex changes, name changes or whatever, then they wouldn't have to hire the people who go into your character's file and make all the edits necessary and pay them money.<br />
<br />
So, they're giving the guys a bigger workload depending on how many people decide to use this feature, considering that if a guild moves, probably twenty-five+ people and their alts are all going to be moved too. That's a lot of work to do. Should these guys just do all of that for free, day after day after day? I know I wouldn't.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc0e39bc26e4</div><div class="date">2011-10-26, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty sure the only thing I implied, which is to say, I came right out and said it, is that Blizzard is full of a bunch of greedy bastards. I can see that you are in support of greed and that's ok, greed is popular in America. Evidently not getting an education while also supporting their greed is popular, at least with you judging by your poor use of syntax and grammar in your post. At least you spelled everything correctly, spell check is a wonder isn't it?<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure I voiced no oppinion on the matter itself, I only found your rambling to my amusement.<br />
And it's not that I was dissapointed the second time around either, though I'm inclined to tell you I'm not american netiher is my native tongue english.<br />
Regardless, we all now that bashing someones grammar is the first sign of a lost argument, though I'm not really sure we had one to begin with.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkpower</div><div class="date">2011-10-27, 07:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Jesus, when will the constant QQing about shit that Blizz tries to do to please the very people that asked for such features, like things to do at max level besides raiding, like transfers, like entry-level raiding, only to see them flip-flop when it's given to them. Good lord, no wonder Blizz would have &quot;trouble keeping subs&quot;. How many times do we see these flip-flopping episodes happen. And I have an idea of what is causing this sort of thing to happen. <br />
<br />
HINT: The reason has suddenly cut down WoW twice in about three or so days in at least two of his videos. <br />
<br />
Here's the thing: <br />
<br />
- If you're GM is really going to leave you hanging like you say he or she could, then that says a HELL of a lot about your GM then, would it? <br />
- It's expensive...so you won't just casually decide to do so, will you? <br />
- Looking For Raid...now your normal/heroics won't be (as) nerfed, huh? And people will learn the skills of raiding, and may think about moving up in the ladder when he or she knows that they could handle the harder levels, thus...more in the talent pool. Why is this now a BAD thing?<br />
- Pet Battles...who the HELL is forcing you to do them? They announced the challenges, as well, and the return of world bosses. Looks like we are focusing on this one thing (because we can't focus on Pandarians now because of more and more people understanding that they aren't exactly child's play) and ripping on it and ripping on it. And I'm sure no one who's hating on it won't be the LEAST bit curious, huh? After all, it's just a &quot;Pokemon ripoff&quot; (even when the Blizz devs admitted that Pokemon was part of the inspiration to this feature). <br />
<br />
Seriously, what is it going to take to people to slow their roles?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">finchna</div><div class="date">2011-10-27, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if you go with the GM being able to move a guild as blizz is setting up, how about an alternative of charging guild members gold to make the transfer with the guild. That way the guild could pay for its entire transfer with a little bit of real $$ and a moderate amount (say 1000 gold per guild character) of in-game gold? I know that blizz wants to get more revenue off fees but for kids who have 5-10 toons in a guild (mains/alts) the real $ could become too expensive for them or their parents on top of the regular game costs. (and we'll hope that the GM doesn't make another move or three)</div></div><hr />
