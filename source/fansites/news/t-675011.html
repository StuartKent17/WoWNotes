Wouldn't mind that a bit since I absolutely HATE the grinding frenzy when needing something for my alt no. 5 :) <br />

Making these BoA would also relieve the pressure on the particular rep. grinding zones. Heck I remember grinding Hodir rep alongside 50+ others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After a few attempts we knew what we are doing, and most of us would ahve at least 2 stacks of the inoculated buff. That means we had at least 50% shadow damage reduction. Yet, when he casted Pugnent Blight, it still killed at least 3 of us, and did almost 25k damage to me still.<br />
<br />
In the video, it seems like they had no idea that they had to get the inoculated debuff, but when they were hit by Pugnent Blight, they lost 50% of their health AT MOST, and thats on 25 man.<br />

Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />

Nope, the hierlooms only accept level 1 enchants.<br />

So it's still not clear to me, if there's rep/level requirements on the heirloom enchants, what's the point of making them heirlooms? Saving 75g (which you could mail anyway)?</div></div><hr />

Either Boub or anyone on the new PTR, have you looked at the lvl70 shoulder and helm enchants? while they are not the best it would be nice if you could give them to alts as well to help level. Or even if they make them level similar to the actual heirloom gear so you can use them all the way from lvl 1.</div></div><hr />

so that &quot;requires lvl 80&quot; means that it requires both player level 80 and ITEM level 80, which means you can't use them on heirloom equipment.<br />
the way i see the purpose of this is for the players with multiple alts who have already grinded their way to exalted at least once already.. blizz just decided you shouldnt have to grind rep over and over and over just to get the enchants on multiple toons.<br />
<br />
btw, exactly how does one acquire &quot;primordial saronite&quot;? &gt;.&gt;<br />
i'm noticing that crafters are going to need the proverbial assload in order to buy the pattern + craft 1 for themselves (i am assuming that the patterns are not going to be cheap given their item levels)</div></div><hr />

*How many* Primordial Saronite buys a pattern?<br />
<br />
That's a critical question. If it's more than 1-2, everyone on the server will be thinking &quot;Let's not spend PS on patterns, let's just stockpile them to make gear and get another crafter to do the combines.<br />
<br />
/trade then descends into raiders begging for crafters until a guild realizes that they can earn back the cost of buying the pattern by charging an appropriate fee to all of those desperate combine-seekers.<br />
<br />
If the cost to buy a pattern is in the 6-8 Primordial Saronite range, I'd expect that &quot;1 Primordial Saronite&quot; would be the appropriate standard crafting fee -- to be put back into the raid's PS stack rather than pocketed by the crafter.</div></div><hr />

As a DW DK myself, I still have no faith in ArP being a DPS boost. However I can see the want for some haste. <br />
<br />
Still, EVERY iLvl 239+ item ive seen thats supposed to be an upgrade has ArP... also, it's getting deleted next expac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's fairly simple - in order to use the item you need to be level 80 - if you use it however the item becomes soulbound making it unusable on heirloom equipment anyway. The only benefit of those heirloom enchants is in fact that you don't have to grind reputation with your alts - which is quite nice imho</div></div><hr />

I am not on the PTR. Is the new Saronite something that is mined? Will it be like truesilver/mithril? Or does it have some other source. The database doesn't say where it comes from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before it was given a name it was actually called &quot;Icecrown Thing of Crafting Things&quot; in the data files. The prior tiers' Things of Crafting Things were Crusader's Orbs and Runed Orbs. So we expect they will drop from ICC bosses.<br />
<br />
See also Sunmotes, Hearts of Darkness, Primal Nether. There's a long tradition of this developer approach to raid gear crafting. It'd be a big surprise if Primordial Saronite were mined.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this is the case then why are they making them heirlooms?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, from the way the primordial saronite is being portrayed I agree with the above poster about it being the crafting &quot;Orb&quot; that drops in ICC, though I hope it drops more frequently since it appears a large amount of them will be needed (for crafting and the Quel'serrar quest).</div></div><hr />

If he's referring to the cooldown tracker above the guy's &quot;consumables bar&quot;, that's ForteXorcist (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info7532.html). CoolLine it's just a crappy clone of ForteXorcist. Note that the Forte thingie has the dot tracker aswell that can be seen in the video too (to the left of his Grid).</div></div><hr />
