Ulduar - Flame Leviathan<br />
Yesterday the european players had a chance to test the Flame Leviathan, one of the boss in the outdoor part of Ulduar. The fight as it is on PTR is fairly easy and it wouldn't be surprising to see an harder version on live servers. <br />
<br />

It's a (crappy) remix of &quot;Propane Nightmares&quot; by Pendulum. Original is far better.<br />
<br />
Also, that video i2lurchi posted is a pretty good thing to include on the main post, it has all the audio files in the correct order (and some side info for those who don't know it).</div></div><hr />

&quot;No one should know the true fate of the young paladin. Not yet.&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
Hearing the sound files. The prisoner is not Arthas unless they got a new voice actor. It sounds like Bolvar and I think we might be seeing the Lich King's newest general. Without a doubt a crushing blow to the Alliance if its all true.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newor</div><div class="date">2009-03-04, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arthas killed Uther after all that If I didn't read wrong.<br />
<br />
Since it's past stuff, could be Uther, and &quot;him&quot; could be Arthas (corrupting the man, Arthas, into a DK, servant of LK).<br />
<br />
Or even Arthas &quot;humanity&quot; (or soul) been tortured by the Lich King?<br />
<br />
If he's trying to transform the prisioner into one of his &quot;minions&quot;, could be Bolvar too. At least we saw Uther's ghost in a quest, so he should be ok. lol<br />
<br />
LOL, YS wants to kill the Lich King and we actually help the Lick King survives? LOL</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think that Yogg might have played a rule in the Lich King betraying the Burning Legion. As of right now, the Lich King is stronger than Yogg and he basically says in his quote &quot;No King can rule forever and death is forever&quot; like he's now underneath him but is trying to regain control.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only direct-ish connection to Yogg-Saron I can find is in the second event since Neltharion / Deathwing was driven mad by the Old Gods and convinced to create the Dragon Soul.<br />
I have no idea if this link is a coincidence or if all these events are somehow connected to Yogg-Saron or the other Old Gods...<br />
<br />
Garona did only assassinate her friend Llane because she had seen a vision of her doing so in Karazhan. We don't know if the Old Gods were able to influence these visions and therefore are responsible for the actual assassination. But I had always thought that, if there was any influence by anyone at all, it would have been that of Sargeras possessing Medivh, well finally of the Old Gods having corrupted Sargeras, yes, but I doubt that this is worth taking into consideration.<br />
<br />
Concerning the third event... Since we can't be sure to say who the prisoner is and when this has happened I guess it's hard to tell if Yogg-Saron is somehow involved (except corrupting Sargeras, corrupting Kil'Jaeden, corrupting Ner'zhul and finally turning him into the Lich King, corrupting Arthas, corrupting his prisoner - See what I did here?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1.: I don't know where you got that from but I do admit that it's likely.<br />
<br />
2.: Ner'zhul turned away from Kil'jaeden (he never had anything to do with Sargeras as far as I know) because the ancestors did not speak to him anymore. When he finally went to Oshu'gun to contact them they revealed Kil'jaeden's true nature, thus he saw clear and stopped listening to Kil'jaeden.<br />
All of that happened on Draenor and the Old Gods' influence there should be minimal since all of them were buried deep down in Azeroth.<br />

<br />
<br />
1 - in the books, garona see's a vision of herself killing the king.... then she actually kills the king.. we don't really know why in the books... now we do... YS was whispering to her &quot;a thousand deaths or 1 murder&quot;<br />
<br />
2- nerzhul was 'killed' by KJ and transformed into the LK after going thru the darkportal a second time... he was convinced to do that by teron gorefiend, who was under the influence of KJ who was server the &quot;dead&quot; sargeras who was being manipulated by the old god... phew... <br />
<br />
the LK when he fused with arthas then became under the direct influence of the old gods so he was free of KJ.... <br />
<br />
its a looong and complicated story.... but underneath it all the old gods were the ones planning it. maybe it didn't turn out exactly like they hoped... but everytime it brings them closer to their goal --- destroying azeroth.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nyna</div><div class="date">2009-03-04, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible that it's the Old Gods that are the force behind the visions in (or are possibly even involved in creating) Karazhan? <br />
<br />
From WoWwiki:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Existing long before Medivh inhabited it, it is unknown who originally built Karazhan or who now resides within its walls. The land it sits on &quot;was similar in shape to a human skull. Many had noted it over the years, though only a few had been sufficiently brave, or powerful, or tactless to mention it to the property's owner&quot;.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Sargeras allowed Medivh to freely explore Karazhan. As a result of the region's weakened reality, many strange and disturbing visions lurked within the tower, and Moroes was known for wearing blinders to avoid seeing them. The visions were ultimately ended when most of Karazhan's ambient magical power was absorbed by the resurrected Medivh, reducing it to &quot;a pile of stone in the remote reaches&quot;, its power taken to serve the Prophet.<br />
<br />
<br />
If Yoggy can show us mere raiders visions of the past and present, like he seems to be doing in Ulduar, then what's to stop him or another Old God from showing lore figures such as Garona, Khadgar and Moroes, visions of the future?<br />
<br />
Another thing to consider (again, from WoWwiki):<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It is believed that all ley lines on Azeroth lead to a location under Karazhan. <br />
<br />
<br />
Didn't Malygos want to redirect all ley lines to the Nexus and shoot all the magic collected from them into the Nether in his mad quest to eradicate all magic users? My theory is that old Maly knows something that we don't (yet) know, whether it be about the Old Gods, Karazhan, The Legion, or something else altogether, and that running in there and killing him was a mistake on our parts. The fact that Yoggy corrupted Deathwing and had him almost decimate the Blue Dragonflight during the War of the Ancients, combined with the Yoggy quote &quot;His brood learned their lesson before too long!&quot; means that Yoggy seemed to have it in for Malygos. We basically finished what Yoggy started through Deathwing ages ago by killing Malygos. This seems to be keeping in with the first WOTLK trailer, where Arthas states &quot;You were following in my footsteps all along&quot;.<br />
<br />
A third thought:<br />
<br />
The theme of the the first two visions is betrayal...Garona betrays Llane, and Deathwing betrays his fellow Aspects. The third one is Bolvar/Saurfang Jr. that will end up betraying their respective factions by becoming a death knight in the service of the Lich King.</div></div><hr />

Therefore the entire process of asking us questions in how far Yogg-Saron was involved in or if he even set these events in motion might be the only desired effect, with the goal being to weaken our minds. While this is a rather funny thing to think of while discussing the topic on a forum, think about how your character would feel if he'd stand before the being that is *posibly* responsible for the world's darkest moments.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1 - in the books, garona see's a vision of herself killing the king.... then she actually kills the king.. we don't really know why in the books... now we do... YS was whispering to her &quot;a thousand deaths or 1 murder&quot;<br />
<br />
It is believed that the Shadow Council ordered the assassination, at least she indicates that by responding &quot;The orc leaders agree with your assessment.&quot; to Llane's &quot;As long as men with stout hearts are manning the walls and the throne, Stormwind will hold.&quot; just before killing him.<br />
<br />
To 2.: Yeah, as I said, it's a rather long shot ...<br />
<br />
Yet still, both of the explanations you gave are plausible, I'm just pointing out that there are other ways of interpreting the events, which again leads to my introductory thoughts. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it possible that it's the Old Gods that are the force behind the visions in (or are possibly even involved in creating) Karazhan? <br />
<br />

It is possible, I agree, but we can't say anything for certain.<br />
<br />

<br />
...and being mind-controlled by Yogg-Saron would result in the player betraying his raid...<br />
<br />
And a more general note: In the end, all the evil we know of which has come across the Warcraft universe has its source in the Old Gods. After all, they did drive Sargeras insane and therefore formed the Burning Legion, the Eredar, the Scourge, Deathwing, the orcish bloodrush and so on...<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and what comes to my mind:<br />
Do the players' characters have any chance of knowing all of this? Especially considering the second vision I found rather clear at first glance: I doubt that even the dragon aspects know for sure what the cause of Neltharion's corruption is, then how should the players?<br />
<br />
Mind games, I tell you.<br />

It could be Darion, but as far as i know, he didn't resist against the lich king's will. (could be wrong please tell me if I am) As for Alex, he was &quot;absorbed&quot; when he appeared in the ending quest for the DK chain.<br />

<br />
After I read the traduction of the Alextrazsa phrase (the one in draconnic), it's clear : Bolvar is the prisonner of Arthas, and the &quot;him&quot; of &quot;As I broke him&quot; is Saurfang jr!<br />
<br />
But do you think Yogg'saron will die in Ulduar? Sure not, Chris Metzen said that he will not die in Northrend, in a Blizzcast.<br />
So where?<br />
<br />
A friend of me thinks Yogg'saron will hide himself in the Emerald Dream (but I don't think so). I'm shared into a lot of possibilities.<br />
The mirror-version of Karazhan under the earth (cf the book &quot;The Last Guardian&quot;)? Nazjathar, in the Maelstorm? Uldum (South of Tanaris)?<br />
<br />
How big is Yogg'saron? If he had record the scene of the assassination of the King Llane, how far can he go? Or how far can he &quot;listen&quot;? can he crawl under the ground to Azeroth?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, we have several flashbacks here, we have many things that happened long ago, we have heavy dragon aspect appearance. <br />
Just think of the Infinite Dragonflight. All their efforts try to influence the timeline and try to change events, events that led to the rising of the Lich King, who seems to dominate Yogg-Saron. Nozdormu is involved in that part in a certain, but unknown, way, as you can see in the quests in Dragonblight at the Emerald Dragonshrine.<br />
And as you can see in previous events, dragons are vulnerable to corruption. Think of Vaelastrasz, Lethon, Taerar, Emeriss, Ysondre, Kalecgos etc.<br />
And now we have Yogg-Saron, the God of Death, master of insanity, damn that content patch has to be great. :D</div></div><hr />

You said it. It will be a massive patch, no doubt, but packed full of so many goodies. I love intricately scripted boss encounters, and hopefully the Yogg-Saron one will be beyond awesome.<br />

I mean it would be stupid to give the voice of a important character to another one.<br />
<br />
Which makes me believe LK is actually trying to form Bolvar into a DK of some sort for future Icecrown raid which just makes sense.<br />
<br />
LK also says: i will break you like i broke him, could be directing to 3 persons imo: Saurfang, who is alrdy a DK now, the old Arthas who he corrupted or Yogg-Sauron himself. It's mostly Bolvar cause at Wrathgate event Alextrasza says in dragon language: the true faith of the young paladin must not be known, giving a hint he is taken by undead to be resurrected.<br />
<br />
What is kinda saying the complete opposite of this all is that the whole event here concering LK is not a thing of the past like the other conversations we see here but more of a present thing.<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion but it seems the most realistic judging from the audio-files.</div></div><hr />

1. No one has really covered the underground of Karazhan (I saw one post on it). Possible Old God under there perhaps?<br />
<br />
2. This could lead to Neltharion 're-appearing' in 3.2 if YS is weakened or destroyed. Assuming the corruption was caused by YS anything could happen.<br />
<br />
3. I think it is Bolvar being tortured, and logic says that Saurfang Jr. is the one that has already broken. May work out better for the Horde and Alliance than it will for the Lich King in the end.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kokolums</div><div class="date">2009-03-05, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1 - in the books, garona see's a vision of herself killing the king.... then she actually kills the king.. we don't really know why in the books... now we do... YS was whispering to her &quot;a thousand deaths or 1 murder&quot;<br />
<br />
2- nerzhul was 'killed' by KJ and transformed into the LK after going thru the darkportal a second time... he was convinced to do that by teron gorefiend, who was under the influence of KJ who was server the &quot;dead&quot; sargeras who was being manipulated by the old god... phew... <br />
<br />
the LK when he fused with arthas then became under the direct influence of the old gods so he was free of KJ.... <br />
<br />
its a looong and complicated story.... but underneath it all the old gods were the ones planning it. maybe it didn't turn out exactly like they hoped... but everytime it brings them closer to their goal --- destroying azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't quite see how it is possible for the Old Gods to accomplish that. The Pantheon is clearly more powerful than they are. The Pantheon has scheduled the planet for revisitation to make sure the Old Gods never really do great harm, whether me and 24 other adventurers defeat one of their eyes or not. <br />
<br />
The Old Gods seem pathetically weak to me. I mean in the grand scheme of things it appears the Burning Legion has done far more damage to the universe. At least we know the BL has destroyed countless worlds.<br />
<br />
I'd rank the powers of the universe:<br />
<br />
1. Elune<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Titans<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Burning Legion<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Old Gods<br />
<br />
<br />
They need to do something to make these Old Gods more interesting. Being beaten to a pulp and chained for all eternity doesn't exactly inspire confidence they are going to accomplish much.</div></div><hr />

I don't think so.<br />
At the genesis of the World, Titans can't destroy Old Gods, so they lock them up inside Azeroth.<br />
Sargeras him-self was used by Old Gods during the War of the Ancients!<br />
<br />
And Elune... we don't know anything about she (or &quot;it&quot;?)...<br />
But for me, Old Gods ARE the most powerful menace on the universe. If they can escape from their prisons........</div></div><hr />

Not to burst your bubble but there will be no stronger enemy in this xpac then the Lich King. Blizzard has already stated that Ice crown will be the LAST patch The new enemies which is probably the Old God in the Maelstorm will be in the new xpac. That was the problem with Illidan they said they learned with Arthas. Do not be so quick to assume that Arthas will die because the final boss of ever WOW (Vanilla = Kel'Thuzard, Burning Crusade = Kil'jaeden) has escaped death. Maybe this is a trend..?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The problem with Illidan was that he really wasn't incorporated much into the storyline players saw (TBC was quite obtuse in the story department in general), and they should not have released the Black Temple raid before Zul'Aman.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't call Kel'Thuzad the final boss of classic WoW, at least not as far as storyline goes, since there really was no cohesive narrative in Classic WoW raiding. You killed the Fire-Lord, then you killed Black Dragons, then you marched off to kill the totally unrealed Quiraji, finally you go fight some undead in Naxx because Blizzard hadn't really done anything with the Plaguelands yet and they needed something new to fill the gap before TBC was finished. Very haphazard if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

I gotta respectfully disagree. The Old Gods combined are stronger then the Lich King but not the Burning Legion. They might have corrupted Sag but that doesn't mean they are stronger then he was.

The Old Gods are pathetic. How long have they been chained in their prisons? They've accomplished zilch. Let's face it the world of Azeroth has NEVER been more ordered. We've got both Horde and Alliance building city after fortress thru Northrend, pushing the forces of chaos out which has never happened before. <br />
<br />
If Yogg-Saron were actually becoming more of a threat, it should be the other way around. Northrend should be a stable base of power for it, and the fight should be on Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms, with Yogg's forces pushing the capital cities.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, the Burning Legion has wiped out countless worlds.<br />
<br />
Yogg has done absolutely nothing. Sure it corrupts a dragon or a king on occasion, but it never amounts to anything. The world just becomes more and more ordered. Its the weakest boss we've seen yet.</div></div><hr />

Arthas didn't really &quot;break&quot; Saurfang the Younger, he just killed him and absorbed his soul. Breaking somebody has to do with pushing somebody beyond the threshold (like through extreme physical or emotional torture) where they become willing to do or say what you want of them.<br />

The Old Gods indirectly corrupt people. Look what they did to Deathwing? They RUINED the black dragon flight and wiped out the majority of the blue dragon flight and made Maly freaking insane. Garona's betrayal caused an even great divid between Human and Orc. The Old Gods are the reason there even is a Burning Legion. Don't be so arrogant. They are not as strong as some of these other people but their influence is their true stengths. Yogg-Saron is apparently the 2nd weakest Old God as well and he's so far a pretty amazing concept for a boss. So he isn't the weakest we've seen.</div></div><hr />

And all of that amounted to nothing because the bottom line is the Horde and Alliance work more closely together now than in most of their history, and together they are bringing order and a positive atmosphere to Northrend. And look at how far civilization has come despite the best &quot;efforts&quot; of the Old Gods. They have gone a long way to completely colonizing Kalimdor, which was a wilderness for a long time. The Tauren were having trouble against the quillboars and now have firmly established a presence in Thunder Bluff. The Orcs are more civilized than ever, and have a capital city of their own now and many civilized settlements. <br />
<br />
Who cares if they ruined the black dragonflight when civilization, as a whole, is expanding wildly across two continents.<br />
<br />
And even if you did count what you listed as an accomplishment, it is not even a speck compared to the oceans of damage the BL has wrought across the cosmos. In short, they are bads.</div></div><hr />

yeah its only because the old gods are imprisoned that we were able to do all of this...if the old gods were never imprisoned by the titans, the alliance and horde wouldn't exist.<br />
<br />
oh and my thought on who the LK is breaking and all that is bolvar. yogg is giving you visions of past kings/leaders and how their rulings were brought to an end, one assassinated the other corrupted, and destroyed pretty much all of the blue dragon flight..last vision in my opinion is showing bolvar's ending. and maybe him is saurfang jr i really hope not since he was just wtfpwned. i hope its refering to how arthas was broken by the LK or something before he became the LK. <br />
<br />
also hope if it is bolvar and he becomes a DK that they make an ecounter in icecrown where we fight both him and saurfang Jr.</div></div><hr />

Your petty quarrels only make me stronger. <br />
<br />
you don't understand do you? you haven't seen or paid atention on blizzcast 7 either...<br />
it is at least hinted, to not say implied that the old gods are behind the lich king's actions, the nexus war, the emerald nightmare and the infinite dragonflight, all this to keep the defenders buzy and unaware of a greater plan<br />
more than this it is also hinted that our own atack on ulduar and all this thing with yogg saron is just another part of the plan, in the end we are all pawns on an evil plot<br />
and as for their strenght and power, it took eons for the titans to imprision them, more than all the story of the night elves, aqir, trolls and draenei together<br />
if you read the well of eternity, the sundering, you will see that the very war of ancients was their plan and they planned to destroy sargeras and the burning legion as soon as they were released as it took all the panteon only to imprision them. also tyrande refers to them as darker than even sargeras....<br />
they are just playing with us, playing with everyone....</div></div><hr />

I dont know where you got this from or how you interpreted this. Source?<br />

However, since the Old Gods are all lifted from some Lovecraft story or variant, your translation could be interpreted that Yogg is referring to another Old God: Abhoth <br />

<br />
you don't understand do you? you haven't seen or paid atention on blizzcast 7 either...<br />
it is at least hinted, to not say implied that the old gods are behind the lich king's actions, the nexus war, the emerald nightmare and the infinite dragonflight, all this to keep the defenders buzy and unaware of a greater plan<br />
more than this it is also hinted that our own atack on ulduar and all this thing with yogg saron is just another part of the plan, in the end we are all pawns on an evil plot<br />
and as for their strenght and power, it took eons for the titans to imprision them, more than all the story of the night elves, aqir, trolls and draenei together<br />
if you read the well of eternity, the sundering, you will see that the very war of ancients was their plan and they planned to destroy sargeras and the burning legion as soon as they were released as it took all the panteon only to imprision them. also tyrande refers to them as darker than even sargeras....<br />
they are just playing with us, playing with everyone....<br />
<br />
<br />
In the last 10,000 years, the Burning Legion have destroyed countless worlds. The Old Gods couldn't even destroy Azeroth. They could even completely control one continent. They couldn't even get out of jail. Results speak for themselves. The BL are a far more powerful and worthy adversary than the Old Gods.</div></div><hr />

The Pantheon and BL are far more impressive. Corrupting Sargeras doesn't even destroy the BL. They can continue to destroy countless planets without Sargeras while the Old Gods...stay in jail?<br />
<br />
It really comes down to accomplishments. The Old Gods accomplishments are severely lacking. Don't -tell- me the Old Gods are supposedly that powerful but -show- me they really have done nothing in comparison to other forces.

<br />
You're assuming that the loss of life on other worlds are of any concern to us at the moment. As far as we can tell, the old gods are only concerned with gaining absolute control of the denizens of azeroth, not killinge everything. After all, once they have control of all of us, they can use us as their armies to combat the burning legion and the titans. To be honest, looking at the burning legion as a major threat before we've defeated all the enemies on our own world is rather shortsighted. The enemy at your side is far more dangerous than the one at your door.</div></div><hr />

It took the attention of the Titans to defeat the Old Gods, and they were only actually able to kill one of the five. Do you know how many members of the Burning Legion would offer such a challenge to the Titans? One, Sargeras, because he's a Titan. All other members of the legion are a joke.</div></div><hr />

Searching to make the score for each faction (or creature) is stupid. You just can't see the value of a faction (or a creature) just by look at what it does in the past.<br />
You also have to think to what it can do or what it will do.<br />
This is how Old Gods works. They WILL do horrible things, and when they will start, you'll shiver.<br />
<br />
What do you know about the Old Gods?<br />
<br />
The fact is, if you think the're not more powerful as the Burning Legion, you're totaly wrong. If Kil'jaeden (the one who can't enter in Azeroth in the 2.4, speaking of &quot;destructors of worlds&quot;) finally arrive in Azeroth with the Legion, the Old Gods will control them, or just destroy them (by exploding their brains :P).<br />
<br />
The Old Gods ARE Azeroth. They are Symbiots, they are linked with the world. Destroy them, you destroy the world, this is why Titans lock them up.<br />
<br />
(I'm not sure to be clear, with my bad english)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">johnny021</div><div class="date">2009-03-09, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok, the old gods are not the most dangerous thing in world of warcraft universe <br />
and why is that :<br />
1- they did not corrupt Sargeras (and i don't know from where did u get this idea)<br />
and the reason of his corruption is : (Sargeras began to despair of his task and gradually slipped into a brooding depression. As doubt and despair overwhelmed Sargeras' senses, he lost all faith not only in his mission, but also in the titans' vision of an ordered universe. Eventually, he came to believe that the concept of order itself was folly, and that chaos and depravity were the only absolutes within the dark, lonely universe...http://www.wowwiki.com/Sargeras) <br />
2-the titans can easily defeat the old gods but there defeat will destroy azeroth (the dialogue triggered by Brann Bronzebeard in HOS ) and if u think with logic creating a prison to contain the old gods requires massive amount of power than to just to kill them, u have to take in consideration the time factor: the energies required for a long long time that tend to infinity is extremely bigger &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than a action that last for a very short time, dieing is instant <br />
SO yes BURNING LEGION are MORE dangerous than the old gods why bcz all they have done is to corrupt individual and small groups but the BL have destroyed thousand of planets and corrupted Thousand of races so there is no comparesson between the BL and the old gods , the BURNING LEGIONS are way to much powerful then the old gods and dangerous</div></div><hr />

Trilogy of the &quot;War of the Ancient&quot; bye Richard A Knaak.<br />
Sargeras was used by Old Gods to open the portal with the Maelstrom to open their prison.<br />
Actually we can't really know how much persons they corrupt, but I think that there is more that you thinking.<br />
<br />
Yes the Titans can destroy Old Gods if they are not in symbiose with the world, but it's not the case.<br />
<br />
I'm sure, soon (maybe in the next extension), you'll see they are the greatest evil on Azeroth.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">johnny021</div><div class="date">2009-03-10, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">-ok-this mean that the first invasion of sargeras of azeroth was used by the old gods to free them self of there prison <br />
and if u read http://www.wowwiki.com/Sargeras u will find out that sargeras :<br />
1-his corruption is due to his despair and lost all faith in his mission and the titans' vision of an ordered universe,he came to believe that the concept of order itself was folly, and that chaos and depravity were the only absolutes within the dark, lonely universe NOT BCZ OF THE OLD GODS . <br />
2-he did not completly enter azeroth (Sargeras was halfway of the portal when it imploded and he ceased to be.)if he did not exist in azeroth only for a few moments how could the old gods corrupt him and we know that it takes ages for the old gods to corrupt lesser entity's then sargeras <br />
3-his power are :<br />
-Invulnerability against mortal weapons, and limited immunity to immortal weapons (the axe created by Cenarius for Broxigar was able to wound him, but not to any great effect), while the powers of the Demon Soul had no effect) as well as complete immunity to fire and fel magics.<br />
-Cosmic knowledge (as a former titan, Sargeras was likely aware of the existence of the malevolent Old Gods).<br />
-he strength of 100 dragons is merely a fraction of Sargeras' strength;his strength nearly matches the power of a portal closing.<br />
-In comparison to Sargeras, Mannoroth and Archimonde were as fleas.This could be a reference to either power or height.<br />
u cant compare the old gods powers to sargeras powers why ? :<br />
-1 bcz in vanilla wow players killed the old god c'thun but sargeras have complete immunity against mortal weapons<br />
-2 the demon soul power that the old gods wanted to use to free them self out of there prison had no effect on sargeras( sargeras powers &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;of the demon soul power &gt;&gt;&gt; the power of the prison that contain the old gods &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the power need to kill the old gods ) <br />
so until sargeras is in a raid killable by players and i doubt it, he is way more powerful then the old gods</div></div><hr />

Wow wow wow! Stop this! I'm not a stupid guy (actually I'm sure that I'm better informed about the story of Warcraft than you)! I never invented anything, I had just read the trilogy of books &quot;War of the Ancient&quot; of Richard A Knaak, and it's clearly explain that Old Gods talk to Sargeras for help him to enter in Azeroth.<br />
<br />
There is NOTHING to judge the power of a Old God, so you can't proove that anything in this topic is false. NOBODY can say what a Old God can do or not, except Metzen.<br />
The only thing we can do is to imaginate what they can do.<br />
<br />
Yes Sargeras was soooo powerful, but he turned to darkness because of what? Despair? ::)<br />
When I talk of power, it's not just about the body, the strengh or the resistance to mortal weapon.<br />
I talk also of the brain, the will, and all these things. Things Sargeras haven't.<br />
<br />
Oh, and concerning Sargeras, where is he, this so powerful guy? Dead? I think not, but nearly.<br />
But C'thun (or Kathune for friends), is he dead? I don't think so. Do you really think C'thun is just what players can see in AQ40?<br />
For me, he is more than that.<br />
<br />
And now, I'm trying to search a logic in what's happening on Azeroth with the Old Gods. I'm sure everything is linked (and one day, Blizzard show up everything).<br />
If not, why Yogg'saron show the assassination of the King Llane? Just for the fun? You belive that? And you think he'll give you pop corn?!<br />
No, he show this to players because he's linked to the assassination! It's probable that he's the corruptor of Garonna, and not Sargeras/Medivh.<br />
Or he had corrupt Sargeras while Sargeras was possessing Medivh? Now, we can't be sure of anything, but soon, we'll know.<br />
<br />
And &quot;Sargeras's corruption is due to his despair&quot;, this is what Blizzard say in Warcraft3 (and I learn you nothing if I say that Blizzard is evolving everyday the story by using the &quot;RetCon power&quot;), but imagine that Old Gods were the reason of the despair of Sargeras, as they were the reason of the corruption of many other creatures...<br />
<br />
If I was an english person, I'll written a looooong text for explain you everything that I'm thinking on the subject, but now, I can't.<br />
<br />
<br />
so until sargeras is in a raid killable by players and i doubt it, he is way more powerful then the old gods <br />
We'll see. I will wait for this moment, as you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creep</div><div class="date">2009-04-03, 03:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've thought a lot about what the connection between yoggy and the lich king should/ might be and these are some of the things that have popped to mind (keep in mind this is just me brainstorming and I plan to do a lot more research into specifics):<br />
<br />
While not set in stone, I think its safe to assume Arthas/LK is the bigger threat as Icecrown Citadel will most likely be the final instance and the Lich King the final encounter. In BC the raid instances made sense in the fact that Vahj &amp; Kel were Illidan's lieutenants and killing them had to come first before fighting Illidan, and in turn after you kill Illidan you fight his master, Kil'jaedon. While I think it would be lame if Blizz always stuck to that type of logic, it makes sense that the last boss of the last instance is the ultimate encounter strategy wise and lore wise. So while yoggy may not be a servant of the Lich King, him dying may end up making the Lich King stronger perhaps? Being an old god yoggy has been around a lot longer than ner'zhul/arthas/LK. He has influenced many events on azeroth, 2 of which are part of the sound bites. Maybe the Lich King needs him out of the way?<br />
<br />
I need to do more research into this, but perhaps the results of the events he influenced inevitably let to the Lich King being the power that he is now? <br />
<br />
I'll be back later with more thoughts after I have refreshed myself with the relevant lore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Captnmexico21</div><div class="date">2009-04-05, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know If this was mentioned before but Garonna might of not been really influenced by Yogg-Saron. If anyone has read the World of Warcraft Comic they hint that Garonna was being controlled by Guldan. Guldan only had to say the &quot;magic word&quot; and she would be brainwashed and would follow any order. That is why she was crying when she assassinated Kind Lane. She knew what she was doing but couldn't fight it. Now in the comics its Guldan's apprentice, the 2 head ogre(forgot his name), who is trying to control her. He is in charge of the Twilight Hammer who are trying to free the Old Gods.He knows the magic words that make her obedient. They have also hinted that either King Lane or Khadgar is the father of her son, Med'an. She fears that she will be forced to kill her son so she entrusts him to an undead mage who was formally part of the Council of Tirisfal. There is a prophecy where its says Med'an will decide the fate of Azeroth. Wether to destroy or save it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AnonAmbientLight</div><div class="date">2009-04-06, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting...so apparently the Old God's have played more of a role in azeroth than i thought. I knew about deathwing already. He is the aspect of the earth, and as such he would have been closest to the old gods, who made him go insane.<br />
<br />
But garonna? Interesting.<br />
<br />
As for arthas...i think the old gods are strong, but i would think arthas would be stronger. Maybe not though, maybe not.<br />
<br />
Sargares, no he is not dead. Beings of his power do not simply die in a portal closure like that. It takes a considerable amount of power to &quot;kill&quot; someone like that. Take the dreadlords for instance, especially Balnazzar. He was &quot;killed&quot; already by varimathras (think frozen throne) yet he has survived. Hell, Balnazzar was killed yet again in the &quot;live&quot; strat portion of strat in vanilla WoW, and he is still alive in wotlk!<br />
<br />
Aslo, according to lore, Sargares did just lose faith. He was ordered to basically clean up and banish the &quot;evil&quot; creatures of the universe. The dreadlords were one such creature. I believe it was a mixture of Fel energy (which is a very, very potent magic), despair, and really just the feeling that he is wasting hsi time and going against the inevitable.<br />
<br />
I believe the demon soul was used to gain favor with Sargares, not try to actually hurt him in anyway. I'm sure the Old Gods know they were going up against a titan, a fallen one at that. I doubt they would have gone against him.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Creep</div><div class="date">2009-04-06, 07:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe the ultimate goal of the demon soul was to lure sargeras or another titan back to azeroth to release the old gods, as they could only be released from their prisons by a titan. This plan was foiled when the well of eternity collapsed in on itself, and sargeras was stopped from coming into azeroth.<br />
<br />
I believe I read somewhere that Algalon the Observer is a titan and that his job is, as his name entails, to observe and watch over the worlds that the titans helped cultivate. I believe it is also his job to purge planets if there is no hope of saving them from threats like the old gods for instance. So.....maybe with Algalon making an appearance on Azeroth the old god's plans could be realized after all?<br />
<br />

<br />
When the entity known as Yogg-Saron is defeated, it means that he is secure beneath Northrend for whatever length of time it will be before he manages to gain influence again. Regardless of whether destroying the old gods would be to destroy Azeroth: mere mortals could never hope to achieve the power necessary to bring one to its end.<br />
<br />
I believe that we will see Sargeras in a future expansion. The crazy ex-Titan has to make an appearance in Azeroth. He's more or less the biggest baddie behind the Burning Legion. With Archimonde out of the picture and Kil'Jaeden no longer a real threat, Sargeras will have no choice but to try and reign destruction upon Azeroth.<br />
<br />
And so for now we battle old gods and try to redo what the Titans initially did 10,000 years earlier. GL to us.</div></div><hr />
