That would be SO cool. Sadly, its quite the ordeal to do so for them :/</div></div><hr />

The WWI in Paris was awesome, sadly it also was the last one. Would love to see Blizzard doing another.</div></div><hr />

Since it is in the US and I'd need to fly half of the world and get a visa (III world country here - Poland), I never even considered getting one. But those virtual ones are cool enough.... I guess.</div></div><hr />

If you’re still grinding 110-120 from launch, I’m sorry but you need to rethink your life choices and find another game to play.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is hardcore player. Why is it crime to play however fast or slow you want? It's not race, lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can hit 120 so fast if you paid a little attention to how easy it is.<br />
Most casuals already hit 120 yesterday, and more today while the hardcore players already have 5-6 120's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the token costs only like 2/3 of what it was 2 months ago. all that after it basicly knew only one direction for years...up, up and more up. So I would not count on old rules right now.</div></div><hr />
