The lovely Kody (http://www.worldofraids.com) also released an updated video of the Alliance version of the guild. Tabards now works on it and I'm sure you can already imagine how ridiculously awesome it will look when you run in a battleground with 25 guild members on it.<br />

<br />
this brings the question...should i go female for my worgen. All my characters are male (for the obvious reason that i am one), but i always like a change of pace. male worgen are pretty badass though. here comes my first strangely OCD decision of cata i guess.</div></div><hr />

What's up with the horse hooves sound for the alliance guild mount? That just seems... wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the Horde Guild mount..... Hell. Yes. Looks like my Forsaken Mage will finally retire his undead horses.</div></div><hr />

No dance yet, making a female worgen turns the player into the male model upon creation.</div></div><hr />

At the moment no other faces are implemented. It's just that one. You can change hair and fur patterns, but the face remains the same, with slightly different eye colors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts exactly. I fear for any Scorpid when a Tauren tries to mount it.<br />
You have to admit though that it would be an awesome mount for the small races of Goblins and Gnomes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Stormbringer</div><div class="date">2010-09-19, 05:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow. That looks horrifying. The female Worgen model is definitely scarier than both the Horde and Alliance guild mounts combined.<br />
<br />
Seriously, Blizz. Please tell me you're including the OLD facial options for the Worgen? You know, the ones you had before? I really liked those. They had lots of hairstyles, and looked like there was a lot of work put into them. I could certainly see myself not CRINGING IN HORRROR every time I looked at my model if I had those faces, for male and female.<br />
<br />
Please? Please. PLEASE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll have to play around with hair/face/pattern combos to be sure, but I think this is promising. Also, totally loving the new hair. :}</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I enjoy rolling females because I identify more with them, if the Worgen females continue to look like that, I definitely will be rolling a male. There's clearly something wrong with their eyes, and they're a really crazy mix between &quot;too cute&quot; and &quot;way too ugly/crazy in the head&quot;, edging on the ugly/crazy side. I'm not seeing fierce, I'm seeing ridiculous. I hope they go through a re-skin like the males did prior to launch, or look better in action than they do in a still screen. The male versions look so much cooler at this point.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alixie</div><div class="date">2010-09-19, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For some reason, the Worgen Female reminds me of a Furry Troll Female.<br />

My thoughts as well. They look half done from top to bottom. The whole model reminds me of a female troll and a female tauren. Im pretty disappointed that the old hairstyles which were nice, aren't being used for them. I'm hoping the snarl is a choice face, and the eyes get fixed.</div></div><hr />

Who cares?!? You are only going to use it in BG's anyways since you can fly everywhere now. Besides that, if you roll horde just for the mount you really have some issues in real life you need to take care of :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh well. Here's hoping it gets some armor and added frills. Guild flag hanging off the tail? I can only hope :)<br />
<br />
I should mention, the problem most people have with the eyes even if they can't put their finger on it, and what is making the face look &quot;slow&quot; as someone so kindly put it, is that the eyes are unfocused. They stare in slightly different directions. Puppet designers have this problem, they solve it by actually making the puppet very slightly cross-eyed. This way they appear to be looking in front of them, not far off to the distance or just completely zoned out like the worgen female above. <br />
<br />
Overall very disappointed with both models. One of my biggest issues with draenei females is the way their torso is turned slightly askew of their hips and I just can't stand it. Now worgen females have the same issue, thanks to sharing the same skeleton base. Please...fix it Blizz :(</div></div><hr />

now, if we are talking about faction based flying mount rewards.....<br />

Who cares?!? You are only going to use it in BG's anyways since you can fly everywhere now. Besides that, if you roll horde just for the mount you really have some issues in real life you need to take care of :D<br />

We've been stuck with gryphons and wind riders for a while now, when there are already so many cool mounts associated with specific races. We've seen some of them, foolishly given to both factions (hippogryphs, dragonhawks), but there's a lot of other cool ones that haven't been seen. I'm still amazed Horde uses bats for flight points but there are no actual bat mounts. And hey, what about Chimaeras? They were Night Elf units in Warcraft III, and supposedly have some sort of connection with Night Elves..so why haven't we seen those as of yet? It just seems like such a missed opportunity to me. More and more ground mounts. Meanwhile in the air, where we'll be most of the time, hey look! More dragon.s<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. I love dragons, and I think they're great, and these stone drakes look awesome. But why is it that Blizzard feels it's more logical to invent races of dragons so we can fly them rather than using flying units we've known to exist (and be ridden) for a while now? Hell, with proto-drakes, you can't even chalk it up to laziness, as they have unique animations and designs. Bats and chimaeras already have animations and designs, and need only a saddle and someone to ride them! If Blizzard's holding off on that to surprise people...well, it worked, we'd certainly be surprised, so come on!<br />
<br />
edit: as for the Worgen females, it just appears to me their irises are way too light. They should just go with the male design and take away the pupil area altogether. Maybe also the eyes are too wide open...but again, that might just be an illusion caused by very light iris. Someone with photoshop skills should work on those eyes just to see if perception by most here is caused by the iris itself or if it's something more.</div></div><hr />

They're worgens, not pretty twilight characters. They're supposed to look ferocious, regardless of sex.<br />

<br />
And the Reins of the Golden King? Fantastic. Looks brilliant in that video from Kody there, I wasn't too sure about the flag pole there at first, but at least it's no longer stabbed into your back like they used to be/are in other cases. And when the lion runs it has such an epic feel. Loving it to bits! Can't wait to get my own.<br />
<br />
It's just such a massive shame that I am *very* disappointed in the new female worgen look. From the one face that's there, it's just hideous. Maybe Boub did what he also did when the new male worgen look came out and posted probably the worst looking face that there is. But from what I can see so far, I am not pleased at all, especially seeing as I've already planned out my female worgen's back story and character design, and that... Well, let's face, that *retarded* look that they have at the moment won't do my character any justice.<br />
<br />
*Massive sigh* Seems I'll be rolling a male worgen in the end then if this model doesn't improve...<br />
<br />
<br />
But then, I'm not a teenage boy who expects to feel attacted to them. ;)<br />
<br />
And neither am I. I actually wanted the worgen to be given a more 'vicious' look, but I feel they've taken it too far and have just made them look stupid and mindless. The male worgen are the same in some cases, but some of the male worgen's faces actually look alright. I'm frightened of what the other female's faces are though.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Worgen female model is not as bad as you think, frontpage screenshot is misleading you.<br />
<br />
Oh thank god... I was too busy panicing about it to read through the comment pages, so when I saw that video, I felt a little bit relieved. So, as I suspected, Boub did indeed post the ugliest worgen face possible on the front page like he did with the males...</div></div><hr />

I dunno, guess I'm a bit sad about it. I figured since they took my tree form I might as well change from being a nelf to a pretty worgen girl, but I'm not sure healing my raidmates with a psychotic grin on my face is how I imagine a druid to be. ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh well. Here's hoping it gets some armor and added frills. Guild flag hanging off the tail? I can only hope :)<br />
<br />
I should mention, the problem most people have with the eyes even if they can't put their finger on it, and what is making the face look &quot;slow&quot; as someone so kindly put it, is that the eyes are unfocused. They stare in slightly different directions. Puppet designers have this problem, they solve it by actually making the puppet very slightly cross-eyed. This way they appear to be looking in front of them, not far off to the distance or just completely zoned out like the worgen female above. <br />
<br />
Overall very disappointed with both models. One of my biggest issues with draenei females is the way their torso is turned slightly askew of their hips and I just can't stand it. Now worgen females have the same issue, thanks to sharing the same skeleton base. Please...fix it Blizz :(<br />
<br />
I actually like the shape of the draenei female bodies, but the worgens look deformed. Kinda like the way the human females look odd too. Tabards look ugly on them. In each model for the races there are sweet faces and there are evil looking faces. I am hoping there will still be an option for the sweet faces for female worgen. I'm not a fan of the mean snarling look. And I have yet to see blizzard be able to make their hands look good or even accurate in proportion to their bodies.</div></div><hr />

that's because the ally mount was implemented into the game weeks ago and they had plenty of time to finish it....the scorpion just came out of the oven,give them some time to add the saddle,tabard and other stuffs and we'll get a very cool and unique mount!</div></div><hr />

Which renders the Worgen race entirely pointless, since I can just, of course, roll a human that has more than one face.<br />

And nowhere is written that everything has to be absolutely balanced between both sides, sans combat strength for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
And about the female Worgen face: It's GREAT! It looks fierce, wild, a bit psychopathic - everything I would expect from some of the more angry people of that race. It's totally ok for me to have options for more tame looking faces. But there should be something for everyones preferences.

Agreed, I've been horde for nearly 5 years now and I realy like the lion more.<br />
I think I've seen enough of those bloody scorpions while leveling my characters.<br />
<br />
But on another note, doesn't the scorpion need some place to sit on? and no tabard stuff or armor?<br />
I'm guessing it's just unfinished, but does seem a bit worrying in the current status.<br />
<br />
And the female worgen.. I actually like it.<br />

^This really, the eyes look kind/surprised, but the barred teeth look aggressive, doesn't really make much sense together.</div></div><hr />

I'm getting less and less excited for the expansion. And that sucks, because I've been saving up for new characters (I have 3 alts stuffed with rep turnins, mini pets.. etc). Not terribly thrilled with the horde mount (I'll have to see in-game footage.. my tauren will look really uncomfortable on that though). Not at all excited about no worgen mounts (kinda ticked actually, saved up for cloth turnins on my pally). And worgen females are meh.

Seriously, that just looks terrible. I really hope they at least have the OPTION of choosing a different face. As for right now it seems, changing the face on the beta only changes the tone of the face. Nothing with the eyes or snout changes. Hell, go back to the original Halloween mask for the face. That looked great. Permanent snarl doesn't. I know Azeroth isn't exactly a happy smiley place but that's no excuse for every single Worgen to go GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR 24/7.</div></div><hr />

What, a werewolf that looks like it's supposed to be - as about to rip you to shreds - is too much to take in? The previous version was far more suitable for purging with fire, this one at least doesn't resemble fetish fuel to a degree the previous did. But I guess that's why you like the previous one more, hmm?<br />

It's great to see people with their priorities in the right place. MOUNTS AND ONE RACE DON'T LOOK THE WAY I LIKE? TERRIBLE EXPANSION GUYS, WHO CARES ABOUT ACTUAL CONTENT AND GAMEPLAY CHANGES!</div></div><hr />
