They probably want to use bosses that aren't available in Timewalking, so no Black Temple or Ulduar bosses.<br />
<br />
Ragnaros is an oddball, but I'd imagine he technically fits the criteria because Firelands Timewalking won't actually appear until after the anniversary.</div></div><hr />

It's a good idea. Just because you feel like you should be showered with rewards for the pure fact that you exist, doesnt mean Blizzard should cater to your needs.<br />

<br />
KT in wotlk naxx is besides tuning identical to the vanilla version while Heigan was pretty watered down mechanically in comparison. I wonder which version it'll be for this boss rush event. Doing the safety-dance around all his mechanics is going to be fun nonetheless, it's an old meme and to a lot it's iconic simply by way of making them familiar with wow, naxx and raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That'd be pretty cool if they made it a permanent stable, another option is it being similar to time-walking, only boss-walking instead since it's a boss-rush. Rotate the bosses the same way the other events and world-bosses are and make room for multiple difficulties as you say with according rewards to follow. It'll end up with a ToC feel to it, I guess, but I don't see that as a bad thing at all. ;)<br />

If you spread the message while encouraging others to do the same, you'll only have to do it so many times before you'll find others freely helping others the same/be familiar with what's going on and that they've gotten themselves into.</div></div><hr />

They've been made to look like the 15th anniversary box. <br />

But you keep seeing shit that ain't there. They've had textures and details added to them that simply aren't present on other mounts of the same kind.<br />

The only thing about MC's event was that it took a long time. It was easy as piss though, couldn't be anything else with Classic mechanics after all.<br />
The possible issue with the new event is that it'll pit us against bosses that have actual mechanics, and some of them were never available in LFR... Time will tell if they'll make it easy for the sake of letting everyone go through. I am betting that's what they'll go for since it's a time limited event.</div></div><hr />

This is an anniversary, not a &quot;stroke the e-peen of a select few&quot;-event. Everyone willing will be allowed in to try their hands.<br />
<br />
Fun fact though: I know a host of people to whom the Core Hound simply was not worth the time spent. Yes, some people are allergic enough to any kind of effort that even the simplest of events can become something that everyone didn't participate in. :p<br />
And, of course, if one doesn't give a shit about mounts, why run an event at all, which is also true for some I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

Did you defeat mythic Azshara yet? What makes you think there should only be rewards for something hard to do?

Reading John Staats book at the moment, the BLZ we knew is gone in terms of WoW. So fucking sad.<br />
Creactivity is a banned word in the corridors nowdays it seem.</div></div><hr />

The dance went viral in a way that no other Naxxramas fight did. So it makes perfect sense to have it in the anniversary raid.<br />

Yes, the vanilla version, not the wlk version where the flames did zero dmg. I'd rather see Malygos from the 1st tier.</div></div><hr />

I assume you're talking about the Worldbreaker mount? The anniversary event doesn't occur until 11/16/19. <br />
<br />
And its a reward for completing an event, not just for logging in.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard should increase the drop rate for the mound profession recipes (Mecha Mogul and Xiwyllag) instead of this Blueprint which is kinda useless when you have flying unlocked.</div></div><hr />

What makes you think there should only be rewards for something hard to do? What makes you think there should be something hard to do for a goddamned 15 anniversary event? There is enough hard content in this game for you to stroke your epeen, but let me guess - you didnt complete any of it, right?<br />
<br />
No I didn't clear it yet but when I do I feel like I accomplished something. Logging in for the 15th anniversary is an accomplishment now that deserves a reward? Is that what you think? No wonder, the world is going to shit if you are that spoiled.</div></div><hr />

It's...not really that difficult?<br />
<br />
Step 1: find out how big they would be in real life (Which, considering it's Arthas, Blizzard most likely has down to the inch)<br />
Step 2: make a statue in this size</div></div><hr />

You don't get the mount for logging in, as far as I can tell. But you're angry that they're having a party? Something like that?<br />
<br />
Edited to add: you get a battle pet for logging in. You're mad about a battle pet? Really?</div></div><hr />

Then again, being subbed to BfA in 2019 is an achievement in itself, but it's not something I'd be proud of.</div></div><hr />

Are a new player? Most anniversaries since they started doing them have had rewards. The very first one had a battle pet for logging in. There was another one where we were able to do Molten Core, which had the chance to drop some cool items from Ragnaros. We also got the first corehound mount from it. <br />
<br />
Rewards for logging in for the anniversary is hardly new. It's been happening since Wrath of the Lich King!</div></div><hr />

I don't know if you only read this comment or started at the beginning but all I'm saying is that I think it is sad that we get that cool of a mount for doing something really easy. Imho a mount of this quality warrants something big to do so you know you earned it. A battle pet for logging in is totally fine but I think truly great stuff should be a reward for a difficult task.<br />

That's not at all what I'm saying I just think that the reward should be reflective of the task before that. So if you did something really difficult you should get something really nice like a mount that looks like Deathwing. If you just have to sit through 3 wings of LFR with content a toddler could complete the reward shouldn't be as magnificient.<br />

I completely understand that. It's a cool mount and should be special. But that's also kind of like saying you don't want others to have something neat because they don't have the means to achieve it. That means everything that's awesome would have to be gated behind content only for those who are able to do it, and those people already have plenty of things available for just them. We have to have some cool things everyone can get, otherwise it's a bad game design.</div></div><hr />

Alliance are almost finally able to get the bee. Horde have had 2 quest raising mounts since BFA came out. When did the moonsaber and hippo come out? They have also been giving more flying mounts this expansion because they gave horde cool shit that can fly while giving Alliance horses.</div></div><hr />
