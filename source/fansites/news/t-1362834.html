Patch 5.4.1 - Murkalot<br />
Murkalot's Flail (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/106244-murkalots-flail) is the Blizzcon Reward pet added in Patch 5.4.1, and grants the Murkalot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/8793-murkalot) achievement. If you aren't going to Blizzcon, you can still get him by purchasing the Virtual Ticket (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/virtual-ticket/faq).<br />

Upcoming &quot;The Crowd Chose You&quot; Hotfix<br />
We're going to take another look at Necrotic Strike's healing absorb and whether or not we feel it should be affected by Dampening. We get that the absorb is the bulk of the ability's &quot;damage&quot;, but there is still some concern that it would be too strong. We're also discussing double Rogue. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/274503-upcoming-the-crowd-chose-you-hotfix/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10195209926?page=14#279))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
Cata dungeons and heroics were not difficult... I don't understand this idea that they were.<br />
For matchmade groups, some like Stonecore and Grim Batol were deadly. Very low success rates. That's data, not an opinion. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384849573606207488))<br />
It's funny. Early Cata heroics are why me and my whole guild came back. Catas launch raids and heroics were so much fun!<br />
There is a place for hard content for organized groups of friends. The Cata problem was that was the only content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385582133269364736))<br />
<br />
World Firsts aren't accurate representations of avg. play experience; better to look at more breadth.<br />
In fact world firsts are specifically fights while severely undergeared, which nobody else will be. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385142501008363520))<br />
<br />
people who come out saying they are clearing raids too fast/easy. whats your thoughts on dbm helping push through faster?<br />
I'm sure it helps, but so do videos and strategy guides in general. Overall, we're happy with SoO balance at the moment. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/385134886048104448))<br />
<br />
Game used to avoid caling &quot;damage&quot; role silly illetirate &quot;DPS&quot;, but it crept in in Norushen DJ and Wrathion's challenge. How?<br />
It's tough. At some point you're using different terminology than most players actually use, so it gets awkward. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384847914511515648))<br />
I think about this problem a lot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384847941862572032))<br />
<br />
Tank queue abuse is getting bad, can people queued with tanks who leave immediately be kicked automatically?<br />
That should happen today overall. If you don't abuse it often, the system is more forgiving. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384844472434966528))<br />
<br />
World<br />
I know people are looking forward to character models, but I just wish night time was actually night <br />
The artists are aware of this feedback and want to try and address it in the future. Too dark is hard to play of course. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/382256677971456000))<br />

Timeless Isle<br />
It's funny you say this. I am not participating in Shaohao rep grinding because the return for the effort invested is horrible<br />
It is intended to be optional. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/384842537527017472))<br />

Crowd Control &amp; Diminishing Returns<br />
We've seen some confusion recently about exactly which crowd control effects share diminishing returns. To hopefully clear that up, we're providing the following, categorized lists of all of the CC effects in the game. <br />
<br />
For those who may be unaware of how the Diminishing Returns system works, here's a brief explanation: After you've been affected by a crowd control effect in PvP, there's a 15 second window for diminishing returns. The second effect of the same category (as listed below) that is used on you will only last for 50% of its normal duration, and the 15 second window will be restarted. Should you be affected by a third effect from the same category inside that window, it will only last for 25% of its initial duration. The 15 second window will once again be restarted, and you will be immune to any further effects of that category for the duration.<br />
<br />
The lists below have been separated out into their specific diminishing returns categories. Each ability shares diminishing returns with the other abilities it has been listed with, and no others.<br />
<br />

<br />
blizzard has lost a lot of potential money just from me and my friends because of it. we're of the opinion that it's pointless to spend $$ on a virutal item that's meant for collecting if it can't lead to you collecting them all.</div></div><hr />

It's a bit disapointing that the beta giveaways are related to the failed socials networks...</div></div><hr />

It's becoming a scientific study rather than what should have been a minor effect in Pvp to protect you from chainroguestuns.<br />
<br />
I don't understand, in general, why CC in WoW can't be more like in any other game, short and to the point. Or, alternatively, why all CC just isn't on the same DR. Not sure what makes devs think going from a stun into a root into a 'mesmerize' is any better than going from a stun into a stun into a stun.<br />
<br />
But I guess people will claim this will &quot;simplify&quot; pvp too much. That's why games with straightforward CC mechanics like LoL is such a noncompetitive baby game right. Ohwait. :))</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc814469773f</div><div class="date">2013-10-14, 08:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's absolutely ridiculous that some CC, like warlock horror and druid cyclone doesn't share diminishing with their other CC or anyone elses. If they ever needed it at a point, they don't anymore.<br />
Also, either the CC is too long and easy to do, or the DR timer is way too short. 8 seconds CC every 15 seconds? Dubbelju-tee-eff.<br />
<br />
I can imagine that a survival based class/team would need it (if any), but a burst team? 8 seconds free DPS time can actually kill someone, and it didn't even take much effort to pull off.<br />
<br />
I will say like many others before me - they need to separate PvP from PvE. Just make a big pass on all the abilities and nerf/buff accordingly. It can't be worse than it is now, can it...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcbubble</div><div class="date">2013-10-14, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They need to put everything on diminishing returns. The list is ridiculous and so is the CC.<br />

<br />
No wonder PvP in WoW has gone to shit.<br />
<br />
Not to mention they're not equally spread among the classes/specs.<br />
<br />
Some classes have way too much CC that do not share DR and some have nothing.<br />
<br />
Wich basically, finish destroying everything.<br />
<br />
Even if the player ignores the DR, he can stun a target 3 times (100%, 50%, 25%), way too much time, even more considering that another type of CC can just go in between those...</div></div><hr />
