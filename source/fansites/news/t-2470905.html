<br />
New Raid: Crucible of Storms<br />
A long submerged evil stirs beneath the Shrine of the Storm. The whispers that drove Lord Stormsong to madness echo within the depths, a siren song of eldritch power. Those who listen and obey prepare dark rituals to carry out their master’s will. Whatever nightmarish schemes fuel their fantastical devotion, one thing is certain: they must be stopped.<br />

PvP Updates<br />
New Epic Battleground<br />
Brace yourself for the return of the cold bite of Wintergrasp where you’ll compete against the enemy faction in a massive 40-player battleground. For the first week of this content update, Wintergrasp is featured as a Brawl. Thereafter, you’ll find Wintergrasp in the Epic Battleground selection in Group Finder (default hotkey: i).<br />
<br />
Updated Battlegrounds<br />
Step into two classic battlegrounds—Arathi Basin and Warsong Gulch— to experience newly updated graphics with the same epic gameplay you know and love.<br />
<br />
New Brawl: Comp Stomp<br />
Head into Arathi Basin for a head-to-head battle against AI opponents. This new Brawl will be available March 20. Use the Group Finder tool (hotkey “I”) in the Player vs. Player tab to take part.<br />
<br />
The War Campaign Continues<br />
New chapters in the War Campaign for the Horde and Alliance take the story beyond the Battle of Dazar’alor as Sylvanas’ latest scheme causes Baine Bloodhoof to seek out Jaina Proudmoore, fare from prying eyes.<br />
<br />
War Campaign Mounts<br />
Players who complete the War Campaign on both a Horde and an Alliance character will earn new achievement—Two Sides to Every Tale— and new mount reward—the Bloodflank Charger (Horde) and Ironclad Frostclaw (Alliance).<br />
<br />
To earn this new achievement, you’ll need to have completed A Nation United, Zandalari Forever, Tides of Vengeance (Alliance), and (Tides of Vengeance Horde).<br />
<br />
The Return of Hati<br />
If you’re a level 120 Hunter, you’ll want to speak to Image of Mimiron located in Tradewinds Market in Boralus or the Great Bazaar in Zuldazar to get started on a new quest chain. You’ll learn more about Hati’s fate, and maybe even reunite.<br />
<br />
Companion App Updates<br />
The Companion App has been updated to include a new calendar feature, social feature, and updated support for new World Quests so you can keep on top of everything going on in Azeroth wherever you go.<br />
<br />
New Portal Rooms<br />
New portal rooms are now located in Stormwind within the mage tower and just inside the front gates of Orgrimmar where your faction has consolidated gateways to the other continents in Azeroth.<br />
<br />
New Pets<br />
Raiding with Leashes VI: Pets of Pandaria<br />
Take to the Mists of Pandaria Raid dungeons Mogu’shan Vaults, Terrace of Endless Spring, and Heart of Fear to collect the following 11 new pets:<br />
<br />
Amberglow Stinger: Drop (Blade Lord Ta’yak – Heart of Fear)<br />
“The glow emanating from these is both calming and eerie at the same time when in total darkness.”<br />
Kor’thik Smarmling: Drop (Imperial Vizier Zor’lok – Heart of Fear)<br />
“Don’t let these eat after midnight, legend has it that it’s very dangerous.”<br />
Living Amber: Drop (Amber Shaper Un’sok – Heart of Fear)<br />
“The mantid are extremely reliant upon amber for many things, and even use it in some of their magic.”<br />
Spawn of Garalon: Drop (Garalon — Heart of Fear)<br />
“The kunchong are extremely aggressive and will eat just about anything they can as soon as they are able to walk. If they can’t eat it, they will smash it instead.”<br />
Ravenous Prideling: Drop (Grand Empress Shek’zeer — Heart of Fear)<br />
“As a spawn of the most dangerous sha, this little monster has some big plans, but needs to wait a few thousand years first.”<br />
Baoh-Xi: Drop (Qin-xi –Mogu’shan Vaults)<br />
“For being an inanimate object for many centuries, this statue sure moves around really well.”<br />
Comet: Drop (Elegon – Mogu’shan Vaults)<br />
“The Engine of Nalak’sha is defended by many mighty beings, and many tiny beings.”<br />
Stoneclaw: Drop (The Stone Guard —Mugu’shan Vaults)<br />
“Quilen were the favored companions of the ancient Mogu race due to their loyal nature.”<br />
Azure Windseeker: Drop (Tsulong – Terrace of Endless Spring)<br />
“This little cloud serpent’s favorite activity is chasing its own tail.”<br />
Spirit of the Spring: Drop (Lei Shi — Terrace of Endless Spring)<br />
“The elemental spirits of Pandaria have been known to plan tricks to play on unsuspecting visitors years in advance.”<br />
Wayward Spirit: Drop (Gara’jal the Spiritbinder — Mogu’shan Vaults)<br />
“Crossing into the spirit world too often can be dangerous for your health.”<br />
<br />
<br />
Upon earning the Raiding with Leashes VI: Pets of Pandaria achievement, you’ll also receive the pet ‘Happiness’ as a reward.<br />
<br />
Happiness: “This thing is equally as evil as it is adorable.”<br />
<br />
<br />
New Mechanical Parrot quest<br />
Feathers the parrot is now available to add some mechanical squawk to your collection. Speak to Gazlowe in Zandalar Harbor or Kelsey Steelspark in Boralus to get started.<br />

You gotta admit the power difference between those is kind of baffling though. Seeing Alchemy's &quot;have a bunch more procs on your already lucrative potions&quot; listed next to Engineering's &quot;summon bombs that do hundreds of damage&quot; and Blacksmithing's &quot;save about 25 gold on your repair bills&quot; just looks strange.</div></div><hr />

I mean.... You forget which company designs this game. Anything that says the world &quot;invasion&quot; or &quot;incursion&quot; involves mindless boring ass filling up the bar for nothing epic at all.<br />
<br />
Only cool thing about this patch is Wintergrasp but that's not new content lol. That's updating older content just like with Onyxia back in Wrath. Not saying it's a bad thing but upping an existing piece of content for 120s, slapping some bugfixes and health/damage increases on it isn't new and is very misleading.<br />
<br />
Now if they did a whole revamp of the core mechanics and concept of Wintergrasp that could be considered new.</div></div><hr />

yeah, but that naga invasion is worse. It is just 1 quest in whole azeroth and not something where u get a quest to do 4x wq and then repel the invaders.</div></div><hr />

To be honest though, Wintergrasp is kind of a big deal, because we might get the best version of it. It's finally gonna have an equal amount of players, which is gonna make it way more enjoyable as it was during wrath.<br />

To be fair, it's a minor content patch, a x.5 patch. I think it's a lot considering that.<br />
<br />
But more importantly<br />
<br />
<br />
The Return of Hati<br />
If you’re a level 120 Hunter, you’ll want to speak to Image of Mimiron located in Tradewinds Market in Boralus or the Great Bazaar in Zuldazar to get started on a new quest chain. You’ll learn more about Hati’s fate, and maybe even reunite.</div></div><hr />

I love brawler's guild and it's good to see wintergrasp get refreshed.<br />

You do realise that interim patches don't normally contain this much content, right?<br />

<br />
<br />
Excluding more useless shit like mini-raids<br />
<br />
Do you raid at all? I mean, raiding is one of the primary forms of end-game content, so how is a new raid useless? Or are you only interested in big raids?<br />
