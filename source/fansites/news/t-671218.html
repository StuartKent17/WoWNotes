Much like Outlands was an upgrade to classic WoW and Northrend was an upgrade to Outlands, from a graphic and art style point of view, we'll see a similar upgrade in Cataclysm. I don't see a reason to all this whining about how the game still looks bad. Because it really doesn't. You gotta understand that realism is not something Blizzard is aiming towards and the cartoony graphics have been there from.. from Warcraft III actually. I have played games like AoC but I really don't think I'd prefer that kind of style. Blizzard could pull off realistic graphics if they really wanted to, it's just not Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

probably because its an expansion for a ~5 year old game.<br />

It's a hobgoblin. The goblin racial allows it to summon one every hour or something to use as a temporary bank.</div></div><hr />

I don't think WoW is not beautiful and so on but compared to the newly released games its graphics is too much behind... In my opinion in the expansion after cataclysm they should implement totaly new graphic engine along with redesigned worlds... Well I thought that they will try such a thing in this one but instead they are trying the impossible, to compete with new mmorpg's on the old engine, WoW still beats them in the gameplay but when you want to steal new customers and get some of the old customers back i think a graphic change is needed...<br />

Anyway I just can't wait till I get my paws on the worgen hehehe :P</div></div><hr />

If anything, you read a clock by HH:MM, so it's 02:11 (11 pertaining to the number, not 50 minutes in this case) and not the other way around. Good find though on a possible hint.<br />
<br />
Also, Goblins are pretty BA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if they upgraded wow they would lose so many customers b/c peoples computers can barely run wotlk as it is.<br />

Not to mention a lot of us LIKE the way it looks. Most of the texture whiners have left for other games.</div></div><hr />

its amazing how the water, such a small suddly change, takes the overall feel of the game to a whole new level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im a bit sad to see the &quot;View distance&quot; is still fairly if not very low in the old world, i really hope its just because they havent gotten the textures, because just walking in the old world is bad enough when its like youre walking in your own little bubble, and fog everwhere, flying makes it seem even worse.<br />
<br />
Really hope we get atleast Burning Crusade View Distance in the old world if not Northrend Distance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well they have already told us they are not going to do that. It would take huge amounts of (wasted) time to redo graphic textures for one, and most players don't want it to look different (she other mmorpgs fared very badly when they tried that)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I thought that they will try such a thing in this one but instead they are trying the impossible, to compete with new mmorpg's on the old engine, WoW still beats them in the gameplay but when you want to steal new customers and get some of the old customers back i think a graphic change is needed...<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you are smoking something illegal. Who cares about graphics when the content is crap. And I bet a lot of what you consider cool and great and state of the art graphics is something i think looks like rubbish.</div></div><hr />

BECAUSE: GAMEPLAY &gt; GRAPHICS.<br />
<br />
Graphics is the little cherry on top, a nice extra thing to have. To me the new water graphics is a big enough cherry. Let them make the expansion more insanely awesome instead of redoing all the ground textures.<br />

Dunno, just comparing the heads he seems to look slightly more angry. But after a careful analysis I think it's just the lighting + this particular face/haircut combination + the fact he's seen from front and not at a three/quarter angle (both the haircut and this face can be seen in the old screenshot but not on the same worgen)</div></div><hr />

I hope the same thing, since the Night Elves are kind of running out of zones here. They've been kicked out of apparently most of Ashenvale, and Auberdene is flooded. What's the plan, get to level 9 and then go to Westfall?</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is playing with top-quality computers. And if you are now referring to &quot;But Aion lookz zo kewl&quot;, please keep in mind that with the amounts of players in WoW, it is really hard to keep up with that kind of graphics.<br />
Think about Dalaran, for example. It, according to you, was outdated already in 04. Yet with most players, Dalaran means that FPS is going to dip to 5-20 per second. <br />
Now imagine that, but everything looks 5x &quot;better&quot;. The shapes won't see that much difference (if you are using Max. camera distance, which most seem to use) but your computer is going to cry out for mercy. :P<br />
<br />
Accept it. If WoW would go to &quot;good&quot; quality, 99% of the players couldn't play. 1 FPS does not equal to playable. :P<br />
<br />
Besides, what's wrong with the cartoony graphics? Although this is personal opinion, l like them ^^</div></div><hr />

And if you are now referring to &quot;But Aion lookz zo kewl&quot;, please keep in mind that with the amounts of players in WoW, it is really hard to keep up with that kind of graphics.<br />
Think about Dalaran, for example. It, according to you, was outdated already in 04. Yet with most players, Dalaran means that FPS is going to dip to 5-20 per second. <br />
Now imagine that, but everything looks 5x &quot;better&quot;. The shapes won't see that much difference (if you are using Max. camera distance, which most seem to use) but your computer is going to cry out for mercy. :P<br />

I agree with you on that if the coding ain't efficient, it will lower FPS.<br />
<br />
But remember that WoW has to run on Mac's etc. too, it may make it slightly harder to do properly<br />
( l don't know anything about coding, but l'd suppose Mac works in a different way?)<br />
<br />
But hey, l'd like to know why don't you like these at-the-moment graphics and want some other style instead? =)<br />
After all, it IS a fantasy game. We kill giants shaped from molten lava, elementals composed of electricity while flinging our bolts of shadow at them.<br />
Not so realistic graphics fit better than &quot;proper&quot; ones, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

I like how this game looks, even though Grizzly Hills looks a lot better than say.. Stranglethorn Vale, I don't mind walking around in STV. I'm not like &quot;ewwww omg the texturez are so uglyzzz i want 2 get out of herez!1&quot;. <br />
<br />
That's exactly what I think....<br />
I can't lvl my character fast enough to 58 so I can finally leave azeroth behind.<br />
I used to like it in 2006, but now after seeing Northrend and especially the good looking npcs and new races I would love a bit of graphic improvement. Not new engine, just like northrend :)</div></div><hr />

Yea im pretty happy with the game the way it looks. It only needs slight tweaks, upgrades here and there. Not complete overhauls. I like being able to run it at a decent fps still. lol</div></div><hr />

The only thing i'm not happy about is the new alliance race. I'm Ally and i'm gonna roll a Worgen, but 90% of them will have names like &quot;Shadowdeath&quot; or something other terrible word combination of &quot;evil&quot; words :-\</div></div><hr />
