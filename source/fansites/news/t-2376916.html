Oh god why, this really should be the other way around shouldn't it? DPS certainly do NOT need further incentive to stand in fire...<br />

They're doing it that way specifically to ensure that people like you can't cheese it. If you want the XP bonus for the PvP flag, then you either deal with the annoyance of going back to a capital city and running back every time, or you actually PvP flag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Adding Pandaren Paladins that nobody asked for when a pretty significant portion of the player base was hoping for Zandalari Paladins would be the most Blizzard thing ever.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Zandalari trolls seemed much more developed than the Dark Irons until recently. Now we're seeing all the Mag'har assets being added. Nothing on what the Alliance would get as an allied race opposite the Mag'har (assuming the brown orcs will be Horde, of course).<br />
<br />
The trend continues.<br />
<br />
What trend? The trend of players pretending Blizzard secretly hates whatever faction they are playing at that particular moment?<br />
<br />
Brown(and whatever other variant) Orcs were all but confirmed, but there hasn't been any official announcement. Its just highly probable when all the new Orc stuff started being added and Ion made an off hand comment about going back to Draenor.<br />
<br />
Pretending that Blizzard isn't going to announce Kul'Tiras Humans at the same time they officially announce the Orc variants considering all the work going into the models is just being intentionally obtuse.</div></div><hr />

They are getting rid of it because nobody uses it any more; nobody uses it because it is trash. How about instead of putting it all into tailoring they make first aid actually worth levelling again?<br />
<br />
Just make bandages useful again and people will use it. There is too much of this needless removal of parts of the game, how about fixing it instead?</div></div><hr />

It's not a squish for me the way it's redacted. It just seems like to level up each xpac part separately, so for example you can be 300 in classic stuff, 0 in BC stuff, 25 in LK stuff, 75 in MoP stuff, etc<br />
<br />
Could use some clarifications on this if I didnt understand it well.</div></div><hr />

WoD had excellent things about it that shouldn't be lost to the wind.</div></div><hr />

I also think the fire spells look too dark red.</div></div><hr />
