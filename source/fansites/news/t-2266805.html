I don't know the story behind that change but a strobing red/blue light can cause seizures in some people (like that infamous &quot;Pokemon Incident&quot; in Japan). Some player had to be a real asshat to try to trigger a seizure in other players. Hopefully they got a long ban for it.<br />

I'm glad they are changing the ToS mission duration. I was disappointed when one went away while I was waiting on my champions to return from an elite mission that took 2 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the last one was the runesaber, which was $25. Warforged Nightmare came with a toy that allowed other players to transform their mounts into one if set out, which might have been the justification for the extra $5. If this thing doesn't have any extras like that, it'll probably be $25. The fairy dragon changes color too, but didn't cost more.<br />
<br />
I wonder though if this is an asset from the next expansion- the runesaber, bat, ravager, chimera, and fairy dragon all ended up being taxis and world mobs from expansions following their release. The moose from Archimonde was originally tagged as a store mount. Quick! Guess the next expansion theme based on the starseeker!</div></div><hr />

Don't hold your breath on it being anything other than a store mount, we're due a new one.</div></div><hr />

&quot;people wanted to grind the rares&quot;<br />
<br />
Um I think you mean were forced to as that was the only way to go about acquiring the toys and pets if they wanted them. I also don't remember people wanting to grind especially considering the number of times people would complain over zone chat 30-50 seconds after someone announced a rare was up about not waiting for others to turn up before killing it when it's death was usually the fault of one greedy dickhead.</div></div><hr />

The eternal power of words. You can swing it both ways. Do people &quot;want&quot; it, or are they &quot;forced&quot;?<br />
<br />
I always found &quot;forced&quot; such a stupid concept in a recreational game that you chose to play and pay for.<br />
<br />
You might be &quot;forced&quot; to work for a living (but you could choose to live on social security), your body definitely forces you to breath and take a piss or shit at times....<br />

Yeah, it is not pretty and even similar (for me) to a runesaber. Seems the Fairy dragon which changed the colour was crazy popular that they pull off another colour changing mount</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't expect otherwise, and I agree that we're due for another.<br />
I probably didn't word my comment quite right. A number of store mounts have turned out to also have been used as mobs or taxis in the expansion following their release. Therefore I suspect that this store mount will also show up in the next expansion as a monster and/or taxi. It may even be a strait up in game obtainable mount in slightly different form (moose, runesaber). Following that, if you wanted to fuel the hype train, you could attempt to guess the next expansion from this mount. It'd be a leap as it's hard to get WoD from the fairy dragon or legion from the runesaber.</div></div><hr />

They should have done something a little less... busy, I'll say. The weird feathers and spikes on a kitty combined with odd color changing just looks like they let a 5-year old design it.</div></div><hr />

Well think about it this way, wanting it (it being a toy, pet, mount or whatever) means I 'have' to 'kill' this mob for it to drop which makes sense, do something get the reward. Now consider that it's appearance is based on chance that you can't influence and it now becomes, I want it which means I 'have' to 'kill' this mob but there's no guarantee that it'll drop. Thus if I want it I'm 'forced' to 'grind' this mob for it to drop. Although there's still the essence of wanting the item in the second example, you're still forced into a system where you have to continuously kill the same monster in the hope the item drops unless you're insanely lucky and get it first try in which the scenario then becomes the first one outlined. Remember the want is for the item, not the desire to be forced into killing the same creature over and over.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I totally get the &quot;being forced&quot; thingy...I mean..I am part of this merry hamsterwheel since the game came out and loving it for the most part. I am just not very fond of the &quot;OMG evul company forces me into xyz&quot;<br />
<br />
Like...&quot;Grow some balls and admit you cannot quit the shit. They just know what screws to turn&quot;. (this is not directed at you as a personal attack btw) <br />
<br />
Which ofc is sad really, because it is all pixels. And something that you consciously chose to play. And yet...maybe that next Valajar Provision box will finally drop that sweet drake :P<br />
<br />
Oh..and by the way..nice sig :D - I got infracted for one of mine once and just appealed it, then resized :P</div></div><hr />
