No disrespect, but how are WW Monks not underperforming? They're the worst melee class if you disregard Unholy Death Knights (in raids that is).</div></div><hr />

DKs do have a Frost spec, not marginally amazing, but still better.</div></div><hr />

They were so bad they had to fix another bug to get them up to par</div></div><hr />

<br />
haha - seriously. In my own world of delusion I am reading this as the classes got an extra 5% because they need it ffs. Some of the disparity between DPS is unreal (esp with azerite traits)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Unholyground</div><div class="date">2019-08-15, 02:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Damn, that D3 news is sweet. New sets for each class and a bunch of fixes for the game in general. It makes me wonder if another Class could be coming since their engagement is higher than it has ever been with this season since season 12 (on PC alone).</div></div><hr />

What about enhancement shamans and survival hunters?</div></div><hr />

How about the classes that are over performing?? But oh let's not ever touch warlocks or rogues. Class balance is even more of joke now</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're far too casual to be worried about balance at all. Warlocks are average in raids and bad in M+ currently. Shroud is broken in M+, but rogues are slightly above average in raids.<br />
<br />
You're memeing based on the past two tiers of raids, which you personally haven't experienced.</div></div><hr />
