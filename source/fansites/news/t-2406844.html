And what a wild debate it is. I STILL SAY 3RD! I don't care if it's the Fourth of July the next day, I say it'll happen! :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the artifacts, supposedly, are gonna increase in instability next week, I highly doubt the pre-patch will arrive at the same time.<br />
<br />
10/11th could be a thing, if they don't do a second increase in instability, in some form. Otherwise, definitely 17/18th.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">2018-06-26, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3rd seems like a stretch. They (hopefully) are planning for the contingency of technical problems after the patch, which would require their people to be working there on the 4th.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc89ec62a408</div><div class="date">2018-06-26, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd tend to agree with you. The 3rd isn't really an option. The remaining two weeks could be. It could follow the 11th which is the deprecation of the Armory app (i.e. the 18th), as it generally makes more sense to deprecate something before it stops working - this also follows their usual 4 weeks before launch for pre-patch. It seems less likely on the 11th that they would deprecate an app after it stopped working. It is possible, but I'd say less likely due to user experience (there are always people who don't read announcements until well too late to do anything).<br />
<br />
I know folks want it sooner, that's given and constant with every expansion. But, if we go on precedent Blizzard has established in almost every expansion, they don't generally go more than 4 weeks out from launch on any pre-patch. Considering the start date of the expansion... 4 weeks (not 30) from launch in August falls within a couple days of the 18th of July making it the much more likely target. (13 days remaining in July, 14 days in August = 27 days {1 day shy of their 28 day usual}).<br />
<br />
There's no reason artifacts can't continue into prepatch.<br />
<br />
(as sheer power sticks.)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaid</div><div class="date">2018-06-26, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This does seem to point to july 10th being the probable date although july 17th is not unlikely. I would SERIOUSLY doubt they do it on july 3rd although with the fourth being in the middle of the week it is not impossible as they would be back in work for the end of the week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As is mine. The old mobile armory app getting retired on the 11th is too much to ignore. If they did the patch before it'd probably break the app before the retiring date making them saying that specific date a moot point. Retire the app and then roll out the patch makes a lot more sense, and the 17th lines up with exactly one month before the BfA launch date. That seems like a good amount of time for a pre-patch and to have a pre-launch event in.</div></div><hr />

&quot;This just simply upon completion moves everyone to Concordance 75 and then next week another bump, and then another. You get the picture.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it wont be on 3rd.<br />
<br />
On reset every week your Artifact will continue to grow unstable which makes it more powerful. So next week your concordance will rise again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ythissien said that next week and the one after are going to see a bump in Artifact Level, so that most likely mean that the pre-patch will hit on the 17th.</div></div><hr />

I am okay with this. I still need to finish my Brewmaster and healing challenges. Those extra artefact levels will be a godsend.</div></div><hr />

I would say that it's entirely possible they can keep doing that with the artifact despite the launch of the pre-patch.</div></div><hr />

Based on that I say pre-patch on the 17th of July.</div></div><hr />

They've said the Artifact would deactivate automatically with the pre-patch.</div></div><hr />

This includes the installation for Battle for Azeroth. The BFA download on the BETA is 15gb after copy pasting live data to speed up the download.</div></div><hr />

so your size may only go up 8 gigs as the other 7 is stuff being changed meaning its being replaced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no Debate on the 3rd as an option It sure as hell won't be the 3rd especially giving the next day is 4th of July which is Independence Day so you can scratch that reset off so it's either the 10th or 17th.</div></div><hr />
