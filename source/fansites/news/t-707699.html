World of Warcraft: Cataclysm will bring with it several changes to class talents and abilities. Here you will get a glimpse into some of the changes we have in store for the warrior. The information you're about to read is not complete, and is only meant to act as a preview for some of the exciting new things to come.<br />
<br />
New Warrior Abilities<br />
<br />
Inner Rage (Level 81): Whenever the character reaches a full 100 Rage, he or she will gain a buff that causes attacks to consume 50% more Rage and do 15% more damage for a short amount of time. This is a passive ability so it won't need to be activated by the player. The goal for this ability is to provide a benefit for hitting max Rage instead of it feeling like a penalty. However, we also don't want warriors to feel like they're supposed to pool Rage and do nothing until they hit 100, so we'll be closely monitoring how this plays out during the beta testing, and making adjustments as needed.<br />
<br />
Gushing Wound (Level 83): This ability will apply a bleed effect to the target. If the target moves, the bleed gains an extra stack and refreshes its duration, up to a maximum of three stacks. The ability is currently planned to have no cooldown, cost 10 Rage, and have a 9-second duration. Gushing Wound is designed to be weaker than Rend with one stack, but better with three stacks, which will be reached when fighting a moving target.<br />
<br />
Heroic Leap (Level 85): This ability makes the character leap at their target and apply the Thunder Clap ability to all enemies in the area when they land. Heroic Leap will be usable in Battle Stance and shares a cooldown with Charge, but the Juggernaut and Warbringer talents will allow Heroic Leap to be used in any stance and possibly while in combat. The cooldown for this ability might be longer than the Charge ability, but it will also apply a stun effect so you can make sure the target will still be there when you land.<br />
<br />
Changes to Abilities and Mechanics<br />
<br />
In addition to learning new abilities, you'll see changes to other abilities and mechanics with which you're already familiar. This list and the summary of talent changes below it are by no means comprehensive, but they should give you a good sense of what we intend for each spec.<br />
<br />
Heroic Strike will no longer be an &quot;on next swing&quot; attack, as we are removing this mechanic in Cataclysm. To keep the niche of Heroic Strike as a Rage dump, it will become an instant attack, but will cost between 10 and 30 Rage. This ability will not be usable until you have 10 Rage, but if you have more than 10, it will consume up to 30, adding additional damage for each point of Rage consumed above the base 10. Other abilities, such as Cleave, Execute, and Maul (for druids) will work similarly. The goal is to provide players with an option where if you can't afford the Rage, you don't push the button, but if you have excess Rage, you can push it a lot.<br />
<br />
Battle Shout, Commanding Shout, and possibly Demoralizing Shout will work more like the death knight's Horn of Winter ability. Specifically, these shouts will cost no resources, generate rage in addition to their current effects, and be on a short cooldown.<br />
<br />
Whirlwind will hit an unlimited number of targets, but only for 50% of weapon damage. The intent is for this ability to be used in multi-target scenarios and not on single targets.<br />
<br />
Overall, heals cast by players in Cataclysm will be a lower number relative to players' health than the current game. So to make the Mortal Strike debuff less mandatory but still useful in PvP, Mortal Strike will reduce healing by only 20%. All equivalent debuffs, including the Shadow priest and Frost mage debuffs, will be for 20% less healing. At the moment we aren't considering giving this debuff to anyone else, though we will certainly consider PvP utility for historically under-represented specs that use other mechanics.<br />
<br />
Sunder Armor will be reduced to three stacks instead of five, and still provide only a 4% reduction in armor per stack. We want to make this debuff easier to apply and less of a damage swing when it falls off.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Talents and Talent Changes<br />
<br />
The Furious Sundering talent in the Fury tree will make the Sunder Armor ability cause 25/50% weapon damage and reduce the threat generated by 50/100%.<br />
<br />
The Mace and Poleaxe Specialization talents in the Arms tree will be removed. These provided just passive stats, which are not the kinds of talents we want to design in the future. We will keep the Sword Specialization talent, but it will be changed to a talent that applies to all types of weapons.<br />
<br />
As a Fury talent, Booming Voice will increase the Rage generated by shouts.<br />
<br />
While we like how Titan's Grip plays, we recognize some warriors liked the Fury tree because of the really fast swings that dual-wielding one-handed weapons could provide. Therefore, we're planning to try out a talent called Single-Minded Fury that is parallel to Titan's Grip and will provide a large boost to the damage of a pair of one-handed weapons.<br />
<br />
Several talents that reduce the Rage cost of abilities will be changed to focus on increased damage for those abilities instead.<br />
<br />
The new Arms talent called Disarming Nature will make successful disarms cause the target to cower in fear for 5/10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Another new Arms talent called Blitz will make the Charge ability hit for extra damage. The amount will possibly vary depending on the distance travelled.<br />
<br />
Improved Pummel, a Fury talent, will cause a successful interrupt to generate 10/20 Rage.<br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Arms<br />
Melee Damage<br />
Armor Penetration<br />
Bonus Swing<br />
<br />
Bonus Swing: This is similar to the Sword Specialization talent that is currently in the game, but Bonus Swing will work on all attacks and with all weapons. You have a chance to proc a free, instant weapon swing that hits for 50% damage.<br />
<br />
Fury<br />
Melee Damage<br />
Melee Haste<br />
Enrage Intensity<br />
<br />
Enrage Intensity: Every benefit of being enraged is increased. This includes doing more damage/healing/ etc. from abilities like Bloodrage, Death Wish, Enrage, Berserker Rage, and Enraged Regeneration.<br />
<br />
Protection<br />
Damage Reduction<br />
Vengeance<br />
Critical Block Chance<br />
<br />
Critical Block Chance: As we mentioned in the stat changes preview, block rating is changing to a chance to block 30% of a melee swing's damage. Protection warriors have a chance that the block will be a critical block and block for 60% of a melee swing's damage instead. There will likely be talents available to push the amount blocked even higher.<br />
<br />
Vengeance: This is a mechanic to ensure that tank damage (and therefore threat) doesn't fall behind as damage-dealing classes improve their gear during the course of the expansion. All tanking specs will have Vengeance as their second talent tree passive bonus. Whenever a tank gets hit, Vengeance will give them a stacking attack power buff equal to 5% of the damage done, up to a maximum of 10% of the character's un-buffed health. For boss encounters, we expect that tanks will always have the attack power bonus equal to 10% of their health. The 5% and 10% bonuses assume 51 talent points have been put into the Protection tree. These values will be smaller at lower levels. Remember, you only get this bonus if you have spent the most talent points in the Protection tree, so you won't see Arms or Fury warriors running around with it. Vengeance will let us continue to make tank gear more or less the way we do today – there will be some damage-dealing stats, but mostly survival-oriented stats. Druids typically have more damage-dealing stats even on their tanking gear, so their Vengeance benefit may be smaller, but overall the goal is for all four tanks do about the same damage when tanking.<br />
<br />

2) I'm relieved that we're not getting &quot;THAT&quot; changed. I mean, it could be much worse, I only play a prot warrior though, so DPS I'm not too bothered about, but Vengeance seems rather nice. I mean, ~5000ap (considering a probable 50000hp unbuffed healthpool at 85?) to scale up threat is pretty nice.</div></div><hr />

Heroic Leap is just amazing, if it would WORK for once. The option between duel wielding 2-handers or 1-handers will make things viable. But the downside is to actually calculate how much DPS loss is gained by choosing 1-handed over 2-handed. I cried when I saw this, because I simply LOVE having quick blades.<br />
<br />
The rage-regeneration plan looks simply awesome, to the fact that having 100-rage results in DPS gain and less rage loss. The gushing wound should be a PVP thing, I don't see it happen in raids unless there is a kiteboss.<br />
<br />
A quick few words, and OMG TY FOR THE THREAT REDUCEMENT IN THE FURY TREE &lt;3 Stacking Sunder Armor means doing DPS + Losing threat is godlike!</div></div><hr />

Heroic Leap is just amazing, if it would WORK for once. The option between duel wielding 2-handers or 1-handers will make things viable. But the downside is to actually calculate how much DPS loss is gained by choosing 1-handed over 2-handed. I cried when I saw this, because I simply LOVE having quick blades.<br />
<br />
The rage-regeneration plan looks simply awesome, to the fact that having 100-rage results in DPS gain and less rage loss. The gushing wound should be a PVP thing, I don't see it happen in raids unless there is a kiteboss.<br />
<br />
A quick few words, and OMG TY FOR THE THREAT REDUCEMENT IN THE FURY TREE &lt;3 Stacking Sunder Armor means doing DPS + Losing threat is godlike!<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless I'm mistaken, I think it just reads that it's reducing the threat of Sunder Armor by 100%, so that you can use it as a dps ability and armor reducer without adding additional threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm kind of wondering about gushing wound. I can see fury/arms warriors now.. asking the tank to kite mobs a bit to get it stacked up!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inner Rage - What a nightmare of rage/rotation management THAT'S going to be. Once we get it down, it'll be interesting to see if the damage buff is worth the rage increase.<br />
<br />
Gushing Wound - Love it, pure and simple. It'll even provide tank 'n spank's with some fun, wanting to tip-toe around a bit to keep the bleed stacks up.<br />
<br />
Heroic Leap - As Protection, I don't really get it. I can charge and TClap on my own. Hopefully this one gets some significant changes/upgrades from Warbringer.<br />
<br />
Bringing Back 1h viability - No, thanks. There's no way both of these methods will provide equal dps, so one will always be inferior.<br />
<br />
Mastery Bonuses - Like all of them. And, let's be real, that tank-specific one that's going to be for all the classes? Hell. Yes.</div></div><hr />

It's really not a big deal imo, but at least it seems like it will be balanced this time around. Also sharing a CD with charge is good, because personally I don't really think warriors needed another gap closer lol.</div></div><hr />

That new bleed effect is gonna be insane in pvp I guess, just apply it to everybody and you'll either annoy them because they have to stand still for 9 seconds or you'll do an awful lot of damage. Throw in a brostorm and you'll create insanity in bgs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Inner rage seems like a double edged sword, but we can't tell until we see how long it lasts. If its a 10 second buff, it could easily rage starve you.<br />
Gushing wound will be nice on moving fights, But it does a bit more then rend, and rends damage isn't to impressive anyway.<br />
<br />
Heroic leap will be fun, But no different then charge. <br />
The Whirlwind change is kind of depressing, But if HS is on the GCD that will probably replace it in single target fights, or sunder where you don't have a warrior tank.<br />
<br />
I'm mostly upset cause i don't see any real changes to Arms PvE, and if it stays the same it will just sit under fury again. This is just a preview though, there is surly more to come.</div></div><hr />

It has been officially confirmed that one handed Strength-based weapons will appear in Cataclysm. If so, its a normal move to let more than 1 spec use them (only Frost DKs would use them, similar to what happens nowadays with Holly Pallies and their spellpower plate)</div></div><hr />

I mean, ~5000ap (considering a probable 50000hp unbuffed healthpool at 85?) to scale up threat is pretty nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
heroic geared tanks are already at 50k unbuffed, i should hope it would be more than that at 85, at least 5k easily.<br />
vengeance should be an insane boost for threat and damage. <br />

-Heroic Leap used to be the Fury 51 Talent Point now it's given to Arms and Prot but NOT to fury.<br />
-Gushing wounds will be non-viable for Raiding unless you want the tank to kite the boss arround<br />
-1h/2h viability will just not work out, like with DK Frost either 1hs or 2Hs will dominate and if there's going to be some kind of mastery cap Im quite sure it'll will be goodbye 1h's again due to less stats.<br />
-So they're basically nerfing both Cleave and Whirlwind, way to nerf our AoE.<br />
<br />
I can see Arms being all good and fun but that's not the reason why I've been playing Fury for 3,5 year. Maybe this is just a stupid rant because both Shamans and Warlocks got awesome stuff (and Priest to lesser extent) but Im getting the feeling Fury will become really boring.</div></div><hr />

Why then is Armor Penetration the second mastery bonus in the Arms tree? ???<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing that made Armor Penetration confusing as a stat ON ITEMS is that unlike every other stat with diminishing returns, ArPen had ESCALATING returns. To an extreme degree, at that. ArPen will still exist as passive bonuses and masteries, but cannot be stacked to 100% like it can today. You'll just get 10-30% of it here and there via bonuses. Percentages where it doesn't become LOLpowerful like the gear that pushes it from 70 to 100.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fxrs</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From i a strictly PvE dps standpoint, I'm pretty disapointed with the changes.<br />
<br />
Inner rage seems like a double edged sword, but we can't tell until we see how long it lasts. If its a 10 second buff, it could easily rage starve you.<br />
Gushing wound will be nice on moving fights, But it does a bit more then rend, and rends damage isn't to impressive anyway.<br />
<br />
Heroic leap will be fun, But no different then charge. <br />
The Whirlwind change is kind of depressing, But if HS is on the GCD that will probably replace it in single target fights, or sunder where you don't have a warrior tank.<br />
<br />
I'm mostly upset cause i don't see any real changes to Arms PvE, and if it stays the same it will just sit under fury again. This is just a preview though, there is surly more to come.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope you're right because this is fairly underwhelming to say the least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I must say from a PVP standpoint, now that I've read this, Priests' DeathLifegrip now has one more viable (read: not douche) usage. I'd assume that being gripped by a Priest doesn't count as movement and could be used to counter a Gushing Wound? I mean, would being gripped count as a movement?</div></div><hr />

However, the Critical Block is absolutely amazing, and I don't actually think it's going to be that overpowered in comparison to Paladins, unless they do something to remove Holy Shield or reduce the block chance added from it.<br />

Current TG has a -10% penalty to physical damage dealt. So, let SMF have no penalty, instead increase physical damage done by X% (I'm guessing 5-10%), so that it's doing almost identical damage to TG.<br />

<br />
- WW damage reduced to 50% (down from 100%)<br />
- MS debuff reduced to 20% (down from 50%)<br />
- Sunder armor stacking 3 times (down from 5... so 12% armor reduction instead of 20%).<br />
- Heroic Leap being a fancy charge for Arms warrior (Battle Stance only if not talented, so Fury can forget it). Fury always lacked mobility, and it will still be the case. (Arms got Charge + Intercept while in combat, Fury only Intercept with an ability to reset the cooldown once every 45 sec...).<br />
<br />
There are more nerfs in this preview than improvements for DPS warrior, especially fury.<br />

<br />
Overall, heals cast by players in Cataclysm will be a lower number relative to players' health than the current game. So to make the Mortal Strike debuff less mandatory but still useful in PvP, Mortal Strike will reduce healing by only 20%.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's because they're nerfing MS effects to 20% across the board so it's not a &quot;nerf&quot; so much as a &quot;game-wide adjustment of healing reduction effects in general&quot;.<br />
<br />
All in all MS nerfs are a GOOD thing. It's no fun to prop 3/4s of your PvP utility by banking on one debuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bliz is still in their BC/Wrath mindset of 'what do we do with DPS warriors, i dunno lols' and put up Heroic Leap again to keep people distracted. Why do I need a threat reduction on fury sunders? Why are they trying to juggle 2h/1h DW when they had such a wonderful time making the former viable? Why is the fury mastery so terrible? And the HS white-hit conversion topic hasn't even been touched upon yet. Even then, a whole lot of nothing has been done to arms so far so fury will likely pull ahead in the future regardless, but where will fury fall in regards to... everyone else?<br />
<br />
At the very least this looks like a good opportunity to restore tank parity.<br />

They're getting rid of Attack Power in Cataclysm so Strength will be the only white stat that boost a warrior's DPS. This means they have to add one-handers with strength on it just to accommodate these 1H fury warriors which is rather stupid as no other DW class utilizes strength (unless you wanna count on resurrecting DW'ing frost DKs).<br />
<br />
That talent is going to require a pretty big damage boost to make up for the ridiculous amount of stat lost by not having 2 2-handers. It'll be even worse if warriors are required to use 1-handers that has agility on it...<br />
<br />
<br />
They are adding 1H Str dps weapons in Cata they already stated that a while ago since Frost DK's who also DW and use 1H were asking for it. Now I see why they were quick to add them in Cata as now warrior's will also have the option to use a 1H weapon for dps and hence need the Str 1Hers</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The description is a little ambiguous. There are two ways to read it:<br />
<br />
1. The refresh and stacking effect are coupled. Gushing Wound stacks up to three, then falls off after nine seconds.<br />
<br />
2. The refresh and stacking effect are seperate. Gushing Wound stops stacking after three, but continues to refresh indefinitely until the target stops moving for nine seconds.<br />
<br />
The first option would be balanced, and I hope to God that's what they intend to go for. Option two would be broken as all hell in PvP since we're talking about a potentially infinite bleed that requires zero management on the part of the Warrior.</div></div><hr />

I don't think Heroic Leap will be removed and for this reason; the last time they tried to add it we had an old world where we couldn't use flying mounts, hence this skill would cause massive buggs, getting stuck etc etc. Since some surfaces were not meant to be jumped on, also goblins will most likely get rockets belts which is a comparable skill.<br />

<br />
Neither of the new abilities are made from a protection warrior point of view. And NO, heroic leap is not interesting, I can perfectly press charge followed by a thunder clap myself. Lets queue up 2 abilities and call it something new! Way to go Blizzard, your developers are sure creative over there!<br />
<br />
Gushing Wound wont affect raiding prot warriors as much, I think its mainly meant for PvP.<br />
<br />
I feel that I have alot to do and manage even though im usually at 100 rage when tanking, Im pressing more buttons than I do as a dps anyways, and I feel that its more challenging as well, so the new passive thing is also not so good for protection warriors. <br />
<br />
Is it just me or do they want less prot warriors in cata? Atleast for me, I was very dissapointed.<br />
<br />
So far, resto shaman has got my attention :) Good thing I got all classes at 80 so it wont be too hard to get my shaman to 85 :)</div></div><hr />

Current TG has a -10% penalty to physical damage dealt. So, let SMF have no penalty, instead increase physical damage done by X% (I'm guessing 5-10%), so that it's doing almost identical damage to TG.<br />
The only difference is if you look like slow and big swings or quick and small attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not quite that simple. Two handed weapons are itemized with much higher stats to make up for not having a second weapon, off-hander, or shield. So while yes, the basic damage might look similar, the stats you got off of the two handers would still trump the one handers. The only solution to THAT particular problem would be to have the talent increase the stat-gains from the one handers. Which is really starting to over-budget a talent, if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

Comments like this make me wonder how much intelligence people have. You sir need to not play my game. The statements you made are irrational and uncoordinated, which makes you insane.

<br />
1) Whirlwind damage goes from 100% to 50%. Currently hits 4 targets, will hit unlimited in the future. This will be a massive nerf, how often is there &gt; 8 targets?<br />
2) Heroic Leap, currently not slated for use in combat and is just a fancy looking charge+thunderclap.<br />
3) Sunder armor takes a huge bite from 20% to 12%.<br />
4) Heroic Strike no longer usable on main hand swings.<br />
5) Heroic Strike now like execute, usable during the entire fight, but likely less damage and still burns a GCD.<br />
6) Mortal Strike goes from 50% to 20%.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, where are the buffs? Warriors virtually received NOTHING and lost many previous skills. The rage &quot;boosts&quot; are countered by the fact we no longer get rage based on our swings, but on an arbitrary number equal for all warriors.<br />
<br />
Also, new fury warrior rotation.<br />
<br />
BT, HS, HS, BT, HS, HS, BT, HS, HS, BT slam?</div></div><hr />

I wonder if WW means a change in other similar skills. Chaining cleaving abilities became a big dps strategy in Wrath raiding, with several fights depending on players damaging adds while maintaining single target dps. Perhaps they plan to change other cleaves too?<br />
As for the simplified Fury rotation, I see BT, Slam, Sunder Armor, Heroic Strike fillers and a lot more rage management. Seems OK to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2) I'm relieved that we're not getting &quot;THAT&quot; changed. I mean, it could be much worse, I only play a prot warrior though, so DPS I'm not too bothered about, but Vengeance seems rather nice. I mean, ~5000ap (considering a probable 50000hp unbuffed healthpool at 85?) to scale up threat is pretty nice.<br />
<br />

It'll be a LOT more than 50k ubbuffed I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Do you guys not the see nerf of Whirlwind from 100% weapon damage to 50% weapon damage?! WTF!, this was our hardest hitting single target ability! (single WW dmg &gt; single BT dmg), and now nerfing it in half cause they want us to only use it for aoe??<br />
<br />
What other ability are they giving us for fury rotation then? Are we just going to go BT, free GCD, free GCD, BT, free GCD, free GCD, BT, free GCD, free GCD??<br />
<br />
<br />
looking for another ability we will use on a free GCD? you should read blueposts carefully....think about the heroic strike changes which will make it a completely different attack<br />
<br />
as a protection warrior I have expected some changes today but it looks like yesterday with one more GCD consuming ability to deal with and maybe some funny rage management</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh?<br />
<br />
It's a charge, a thunder clap, AND a stun. The stun is the definite reason why you should use it as Prot. It creates an initial time when a mob won't hit that you can use to position yourself for hitting them all with a Shockwave. This has potential for great threat value. It may not be very original, yeah, but damn it, you're JUMPING IN THE AIR AND SLAMMING INTO ENEMIES. How badass is that?<br />
<br />
And Gushing Wound could have the potential to create a nice, constant threat value if the target is moving, which could very well happen in some Cataclysm fights. It may not be our main threat tool, but it's a bonus, and already better than what Rend is.<br />
<br />
I really don't know why you're disappointed. These changes REALLY make me want to get my Warrior to 85 quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rage management seems awesome. Mindlessy spamming retards will have a really hard time to get it right. Will for sure drop them way below 10% less.<br />
More depth in dps! Yes pls.<br />
<br />
Heroic leap is great, and it's not just another charge with different looks. Now one can actually jump up to things which charge won't do.<br />
It would be more awesome without having a target requirement thou like it was in wotlk beta.<br />
<br />
Only concern for me is the weap specializations which i've liked since vanilla. That different weapons actually matter for warriors. I'm hoping they won't take it away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the jetpacks targetted the mage if you clicked it once and targetted a pre-determined area on your own ship if you click it again.... then yeah. It will be like a charge with a flying effect+TC to a target. Not to a selected area. Which basicly renders the ability incredibly useless as it's only usable out of combat so far.<br />
<br />
Im just waiting to see what the other classes get but I will probably not stick to warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first impression as pve dps warrior.<br />
<br />
Where is the new stuff?<br />
<br />
Reflecting most things on the current state of warriors it feel like nerfs or nothing new cool to look out for (specially the last)<br />
-Sunder armor 20% to 12% armor reduction<br />
-Heroic leap is just charge+Tc. why would we want this<br />
-Gushing wounds new version of rend. im here to place a big fcxing weapon in a mobs skull not to pinch him so he slowly bleeds<br />
-removing whirlwind out of fury rotation which already was so few buttons. (i loved our niche where we could be kings on small trash packs and others on the really big). <br />
-mortal strike from 50% to 20%<br />
-1h or 2h fury. easy to predict 1 spec will be better, everybody will go for that, end of story<br />
-The Furious Sundering, why do they call this new, we already sundered in berserker and had no trouble with threat<br />
-Arms weapon spec removed only the worst of all remains which is the chance on another swing<br />
<br />
i could go on<br />
<br />
so...can anybody point out what we exactly got new and isnt just a tweak on an ability we already had.<br />
<br />
<br />
and i promised myself so much not to call doom when this info comes out and just to wait and see<br />

If the target moves, the bleed gains an extra stack and refreshes its duration, up to a maximum of three stacks.

<br />
I must say from a PVP standpoint, now that I've read this, Priests' DeathLifegrip now has one more viable (read: not douche) usage. I'd assume that being gripped by a Priest doesn't count as movement and could be used to counter a Gushing Wound? I mean, would being gripped count as a movement?<br />
<br />
The mechanic for movement probably works like Shadow Prison on Princes heroic. That is to say, you could stutterstep it so it won't stack, and abilities that move you probably don't count. As a rogue main, I know that Killing Spree doesn't count as movement for that mechanic.</div></div><hr />

nerfs for pvp :/<br />
<br />
<br />
Whirlwind will hit an unlimited number of targets, but only for 50% of weapon damage<br />
Bladestorm nerf by 50% ...<br />
<br />
And how does the ragedump HS compile with Inner Rage ? Are we supposed to stack rage or are we supposed to quickly dump it?<br />
<br />
Will BS, CS, DS share a cd? or should we change our buff constantly to get the rage?<br />
<br />
Please clarify the MS nerf, will all classes (mage, rouge, shadow, hunter, warrior) have the 20% MS? you could just delete it completely, 50% of all classes have the same skill, homogenization ya know ;)<br />
<br />
Disarming Nature has diminishing returns with ... &lt;- ?<br />
<br />
Pummel &lt;===&gt; Battle Stance ? Will we still be forced to use stupid macros? Its not a challenge its just a matter of writing a macro to do the job for you...<br />
<br />
Are you sure you want us to be the king of random again? The swordprocs + Arms mastery = GOD OF RANDOM! <br />
<br />
just my 2 cents :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirsimeon</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These new ideas seem to be very radical -<br />
Warriors jump-charge into battle, Shamans can cast while moving around...<br />
<br />
Hence, I'm very interested in seeing what mages get - mages rarely get anything interesting.<br />

It'll dump automatically due to the increased rage drain associated. Anyone else notice this?<br />
<br />
There needs to be some trade-off I think, to make using HS worth it as a dump, other than means of a dump, since that will be passively accomplished.<br />
<br />
The Heroic leap is really unsatisfying to see as well. Making it a glorified charge seems pretty weak. Why do you need another one that doesn't accomplish anything more than Charge? As other have said, it's really very watered down. Not being able to control your leap is very underwhelming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, you can fly but it will cost you: MS debuff 50%-&gt;20%, WW dmg 100%-&gt;50%, Sunder Armor 20%-&gt;12%. Good deal? I don't think so!<br />
<br />
edit: oh and arms warrior, Bladestorm reduced to 50% damage too? And btw you just lost 5% crit and 5% crit damage bonus</div></div><hr />

Heroic Leap (Level 85): This ability makes the character leap at their target and apply the Thunder Clap ability to all enemies in the area when they land. Heroic Leap will be usable in Battle Stance and shares a cooldown with Charge, but the Juggernaut and Warbringer talents will allow Heroic Leap to be used in any stance and possibly while in combat. The cooldown for this ability might be longer than the Charge ability, but it will also apply a stun effect so you can make sure the target will still be there when you land. <br />
<br />
It's not going to be the Heroic Leap from the WotLK Beta where you could leap to some imaginary point, nor you'll be able to select an area where to leap - if a rogue vanishes, you can't leap to that spot unless there's another target you could leap to.<br />
This is nothing else than a charge with different optics and a combined thunder clap effect - nothing more. And that for a 85 talent. Poor.</div></div><hr />

Currently hits 4 targets, will hit unlimited in the future. This will be a massive nerf, how often is there &gt; 8 targets?<br />
<br />
I can think of quite a lot of trash fights in raids and instances with 8+ targets. Which, with Cleave being changed to an instant attack, makes Whirlwind the attack to use to wrack up damage on large trash packs while Cleave is the sensible choice for the ~4 mob packs in, say, a heroic instance. You're actually gaining a tool, not losing one.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, where are the buffs? Warriors virtually received NOTHING and lost many previous skills. The rage &quot;boosts&quot; are countered by the fact we no longer get rage based on our swings, but on an arbitrary number equal for all warriors.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of people can agree that Warriors (and more comprehensively, the Rage in general) have needed to be adjusted mechanically at the most fundamental level for a long time now. They've gotten by this far with Blizzard's haphazard band-aid adjustments, but they really needed to go back to the drawing board. And that's what Blizzard has done.<br />
<br />
You're looking at this whole thing the wrong way through a half-empty glass. Read over the preview again carefully, and try to resist the urge to focus solely on the negative and go straight for the QQ. Look for the changes like the example I just pointed out with WW and Cleave. Just because they're not slamming you over the head with new OMGWTFBBQ abilities doesn't mean the buffs aren't there.</div></div><hr />

They're getting rid of Attack Power in Cataclysm so Strength will be the only white stat that boost a warrior's DPS. This means they have to add one-handers with strength on it just to accommodate these 1H fury warriors which is rather stupid as no other DW class utilizes strength (unless you wanna count on resurrecting DW'ing frost DKs).<br />
<br />
<br />
That's exactly what they are doing.<br />
<br />
There will be 1H weapons with strength for fury warriors and frost DKs, and then there will be 1H weapons with agility for enh shamans and rogues. Large chances are that the rogue and shaman weapons will be axes, where the warrior and DK (aka rogues in plate) weapons will be swords.<br />

Heroic Strike has changed into an Execute between the 10 and 100 Rage, eating up to 30 Rage every time it is used for additional damage. If there is no CD on it, you can dump that Rage almost instantly coupled with Inner Rage proc'd, leading me to believe that working Shouts into your rotation may become mandatory. <br />

I dunno about that. The notes about block and crit-block are kind of fucking huge. Unless they up and give paladins something similar (I highly doubt they will) Warriors are going to have some serious-damn mitigation. AD's 15% reduction can eat a dick compared to crit block where big hits are concerned.<br />
<br />
It's going to be interesting to see how block and parry interact because you KNOW there's going to be a boss that lands extremely huge hits on a predictable timer, and somewhere a warrior is going to crit-block the big attack directly following a white-swing parry. That's a lot of damage not being taken if they're not mutually exclusive on an attack-to-attack basis.</div></div><hr />

Except that unless you have more than 3 targets (4 if you've glyphed it), Cleave only has to do base weapon damage to be a better use of a GCD than Whirlwind. <br />

If you've got more than 4 targets up, you're probably fighting non-elites, so have fun with that I guess.</div></div><hr />

Overall i do believe it's a slight nerf for both PvE and PvP. I don't see Gushing Wound as a great talent for PvE, might work for PvP but only if it could be applied because of Whirlwind/Bladestorm crits aswell, rather than having to apply it to each individual opponent manually. Heroic Leap doesn't seem that heroic as it is right now, possibly even a nuisance because of removing crowd controls.<br />
<br />
I do like the ragecap buff though, i wonder how that will work out for tanks, who by the way get this great AP buff rom Mastery =) <br />
Finally! one-handers for Fury are coming back =) it's my personal preference to be honest to swing very fast, i do wonder how it will work out. Guess either 2x 1h or 2x 2h will be best in the end, so all will specc it thus ending the 'freedom of choice'.<br />
<br />
Overall though, i'd say it's a slight nerf as it is right now.</div></div><hr />

Gushing Wound only refreshes when it gains a stack, making it last a maximum of 27 seconds if the target moves right when it's about to fall off, or a minimum of, say 11 seconds, of constant moving. Reread its description.<br />

&quot;If the target moves, the bleed gains an extra stack and refreshes its duration&quot;<br />
no where does it say it doesn't just refresh if it has 3 stacks. Just if the target moves, 2 effects happen, it gains a stack(if it can gain a stack) and it refreshes.

To be fair, assuming GW shares the same standard DoT functionality the look to be giving every DoT in the game, once you stack it to 3 you will be able to refresh the duration by hitting the mob with another GW and it will simply reset the duration at 3 stacks without so much as clipping a tick.

<br />
<br />
The difference here being one is a reactive debuff, and the other is manually applied. I have as much information as you right now, so it simply comes down to interpretation and game balance. The way I read it, the gain of a stack allows the debuff to refresh &lt;i&gt;itself&lt;/i&gt;. If it is unable to gain a stack (considering it maxes out at 3), the secondary effect of the DoT is unable to execute and the 3 stack of the DoT ticks down until it falls off.<br />
<br />
Again, not fact, just my logical interpretation of what's written in Blue. ^_-<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;Edit:&lt;/i&gt; However, if you apply the Gushing Wound &lt;b&gt;yourself&lt;/b&gt; while at 3 stacks, I'd assume you'd be able to keep it rolling, but it would be counter-intuitive if you could manually stack it. That make sense?</div></div><hr />

exactly... i used a double negative on purpose... <br />
<br />
1 negative <br />
deadly poison doesn't refresh the duration when you have 5 stacks (false)<br />
<br />
2 negatives<br />
deadly poison doesn't NOT refresh the duration when you have 5 stacks(true)<br />
<br />
I just mean that the condition of having a full stack in the case of deadly poison, does not cause your additional procs to stop it from refreshing, so where in the gushing wounds description does it say otherwise?(since tha's how stacking mechanics have ALWAYS worked, it would need something specific to define its behavior as different from the norm)</div></div><hr />

But I dont get it (I am a mage).<br />
<br />
What is this different then (charge ft Thunderclap) Only that its in the sky and you get stunned.<br />
Clothies has to quit the game because of this, no more kiting b/c of this....<br />
<br />
I have checked the Youtube vid... but still not get the whole AMAZING OMG! thing...<br />
<br />
If I see a fat warrior flying my way, ill blink behind hes ass xD<br />
That was not possible with charge... but now it is !! Cheesy<br />
<br />
So imo, warriors are even more screwed if they use this against mages/warlocks.</div></div><hr />

As a PVE only Fury warrior, with this preview and the rage normalization, I'm extremly worried.<br />
<br />
WW now don't work for single targets fight so our rotation now is Stack Sunder &gt; Stack GW(if the boss moves) BT &gt; HS<br />
<br />
Heroic Leap and Gushing Wound are more towards pvp<br />
<br />
We have to stack rage to have 15% more damage, but using 50% more rage (and with rage normalization) there is a serious risk of rage starvation once you have 100 rage (OMG)<br />
<br />
Shouts changes seems cool, and the idea of using 1h again seems nice.<br />
<br />
Our passive abilities are damage, haste and Intesify the enrage. Maybe these stats and the new talents can help us out. At least I hope<br />
<br />
Didn't like the removal of Poleaxe and mace specs (the ones that matter in PVE, oh my)<br />
<br />
Hoping to see more stuff at the beta.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laan</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The difference here being one is a reactive debuff, and the other is manually applied. I have as much information as you right now, so it simply comes down to interpretation and game balance. The way I read it, the gain of a stack allows the debuff to refresh &lt;i&gt;itself&lt;/i&gt;. If it is unable to gain a stack (considering it maxes out at 3), the secondary effect of the DoT is unable to execute and the 3 stack of the DoT ticks down until it falls off.<br />
<br />
Again, not fact, just my logical interpretation of what's written in Blue. ^_-<br />
<br />
&lt;i&gt;Edit:&lt;/i&gt; However, if you apply the Gushing Wound &lt;b&gt;yourself&lt;/b&gt; while at 3 stacks, I'd assume you'd be able to keep it rolling. That make sense?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, like i said, i dont believe theres a single stacking debuff in the game that works that way, and they havn't specified the way gushing wound works to be any different.<br />
<br />
And tbh the way you describe feels really clunky mechanic wise. The intent of the debuff is obviously to make your target stand still if they want the debuff off(pvp connotation). if you can move constantly, (stacking to 3 quickly) and then continue to move as the 9 second dot ticks off? I dunno, i doubt that will be the case.</div></div><hr />

Rumor has it, when a warrior does heroic leap the casters body is frozen in place until the move is done.<br />

*nod* I edited my reply again. I was thinking about it, and I honestly don't believe you can manually stack Gushing Wound yourself. It just wouldn't make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only those idiots who don't READ THE FUCKLING BLUEPOST are happy about heroic leap, because they think it'll work like it did in the WotLK Beta where you could charge, then leap (without having to select a target, it just leaped to some point infront of you) and then intercept. This was awesome and still would be, but that what they're presenting as heroic leap isn't the old one, it's just another charge, nothing more.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sting</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 06:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno about that. The notes about block and crit-block are kind of fucking huge. Unless they up and give paladins something similar (I highly doubt they will) Warriors are going to have some serious-damn mitigation. AD's 15% reduction can eat a dick compared to crit block where big hits are concerned.<br />
<br />
It's going to be interesting to see how block and parry interact because you KNOW there's going to be a boss that lands extremely huge hits on a predictable timer, and somewhere a warrior is going to crit-block the big attack directly following a white-swing parry. That's a lot of damage not being taken if they're not mutually exclusive on an attack-to-attack basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
We already knew 95% of what you just said from before the notes. The only new interesting thing is that Critical Block will stay in the game, which is alright. I was just hoping for more Protection notes instead of 90% concerning dps.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Veay</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, from my point of view (most of the time a raiding fury warrior) there is almost nothing interesting and nothing that can prove useful. Seeing how defensive they are with Inner Rage it will be probably tuned to the point there is no reason to wait for 100 rage, Whirlwind dead, single-minded fury pointless, enrage intensity some joke compared to other &quot;3rd&quot; bonuses - a little more dmg boost on deathwish and knowing the warrior class prolly increasing dmg taken also. The only useful thing i noticed is furious sundering. All that paired up with normalized crap rage generation makes me sceptical. Eh, we will see, its still &quot;too soon&quot; to tell after all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omians</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 06:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for the whole gushing Wounds ability it does sound good for kitting and pvp.. but for boss fights kind of makes me think it should get alittle extra mechanic for just a boss fight &quot; When the boss casts an ability it reopens the gushing wound from movement, adding (3-5) seconds back onto gushing wounds duration&quot; not the full 9 seconds cause some bosses use abilities pretty often so make it a chance of falling off the boss to were you need to reapply it thats just my idea</div></div><hr />

Oh, and on the flip side, standing still for 9 seconds in any PvP situation is a good way to die. My theory for how this DoT is intended to be used is to discourage players from running away from the Warrior, standing still to pop off a few casts, and then continuing to run. If you do that, the DoT stays on you longer than if you had just kept running for the 9+ seconds.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Naydie</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 06:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While we like how Titan's Grip plays, we recognize some warriors liked the Fury tree because of the really fast swings that dual-wielding one-handed weapons could provide. Therefore, we're planning to try out a talent called Single-Minded Fury that is parallel to Titan's Grip and will provide a large boost to the damage of a pair of one-handed weapons.<br />
<br />
I like that.<br />
<br />
Other than that nothing really interesting sadly. Heroic leap was awesome in the wotlk beta but like it will be now is almost exactly like charge, but with thunderclap? Woo woo.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VincentWolf</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 06:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm hoping they know what they doing by making 1hand fury viable. Many warriors (myself included) find 2hand dualweild unique to class and extremely badass, hence making our awesome class even more enjoyable. 1hand is just a rogue in plate, and I hope there'll be enough 2handers to go around so guilds didn't give them to other classes over fury warriors simply &quot;because we can use 1handers now too&quot;. That'd make me personally lose alot of interest...<br />
Other than that, everything else looks... well.. dunno, fun... Most of it won't make it to live, rest gonna get nerfed to the ground as usual....</div></div><hr />

So it would be as nice as Army of the Dead which the DK's can do.<br />
<br />
I found it annoying with the change of WW and HS</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lordik</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 06:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think blizzard do 1 marginal mistake - want have all class balanced (same dps, same survivality, same healing, same bla bla) i think will be more funnier, when every class have different usage. example (arms have ms debuf it was his speciality,drood hots, priest manaburn,etc) <br />
<br />
about changes i aggre, they looks cool but arms looks to much rng based, furry nerfed ^^, prot nice<br />
<br />
i think we was waiting for some skill / talent higher in talent tree ...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BLSTMASTER</div><div class="date">2010-04-08, 06:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so now i dont have to surrender one finger to hs anymore :P<br />
I don't know i kind of enjoyed spamming hs (altho on later content rage is rarely an issue and you just keep spamming it and it feels a bit clunky)<br />
hopefully the new change makes rage management more of a smart choice. <br />
<br />
On a side note, will HS still be off the gcd?<br />
I know becoming instant cast seems like it will prolly be under the influence of gcd but there are many skills that are instant casts that are off the gcd (interrupt spells for instance)<br />
<br />
maybe to make sure we dont get to spam HS and get 3 hits in &lt; 1sec they will add a gcd that only applies to HS/cleave ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
otherwise its Really great previews and im looking forward for some more stuff to the tank tree also</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fury PvE will suck. Sunders will be our duty now even more since prot warriors will likely say: fu fury warriors: you do damage now with it: go stack it! No more hard hitting abilities/combos but slow ticking DoT :/.<br />
<br />
Imagine walking back to a boss with 2-4 adds (these are the beautifulest fights for a Fury warrior):<br />
<br />
Wotlk: cleave queued up and WW off cool-down: BAM! some nice beautiful burst<br />
<br />
Cata: sunder 3 times &gt; stack gushing winds 3 times (mayb, depends on damage)&gt; use WW (hits for a wussy)&gt; wait for 100 rage to get the intensify buff &gt; WW and Cleave &gt; Stack up rage for intensify again.. <br />
<br />
I LOVE to use cleave/ww and fill up with BT and Slam and position meself for cleave while maintaining my rotation. Now it's just so lame.... oh 2 targets? Only cleave ww. 1 Target? Stack lame DoT's and spam BT/Slam/HS every cooldown. <br />
<br />
It i'll prolly be:<br />
single target:<br />
Intensify buff&gt;GW&gt;Sunder&gt;BT&gt;Slam&gt;HS <br />
Multitarget:<br />
Intensify buff&gt;Sunder&gt;WW&gt;Cleave<br />
<br />
but yea. Damage wil be balanced I'm sure of that. But the gameplay will be way to boring.<br />
<br />
And I don't want 1handers. Who wanted onehanders? wielding 2 x 2handers is like one of the COOLEST talents. Please don't let warriors be this soft wussy 1handed characters. People will follow the best dps spec, and not the coolest looking one. So if 1h&gt;2h dps-wise. It's going to be 1h only etc. We'll have less gimmick fights now afaik. Skill cap will go down by a ton afaik. afaik; these changes blow. Having to get to 100 rage with this rage normalizing will be crap I guess, waiting out while you COULD do damage just to wait to do more damage LATER on. What kind of design is that? I want to do damage now! They better implement this really really really good because my paladin looks attractive now for sure.<br />
<br />
The only thing i like is that mastery will now increase the benifit of Deathwish/Intensify buff etc. BS, CS giving rage.. yea .. usefull outside of combat with Bloodrage on CD but yea.. NO free GCD afaik. Only to get to 100 rage quicker!</div></div><hr />

My question wasn't answered, and I can't seem to find anyone asking about it in this thread. If Taste for Blood is kept in the Arms tree, do you think that Gushing Wound is going to proc it?<br />

So far, feel like the previews have been: shaman &gt; warrior = priest &gt; warlock in cool/uniqueness.</div></div><hr />
