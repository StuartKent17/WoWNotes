Itemlevel 200: &quot;Old&quot; Heroic Dungeon epics / Naxx-10 Epics<br />
Itemlevel 213: Naxx-25 epics<br />
<br />
Where's the fault in having a new 5-man dungeon, likely tuned at a higher difficulty than the existing 5-man dungeons, reward the players with &quot;Old&quot; itemlevel epics? Ulduar 25 Hard mode, is by the way itemlevel 232/239 which is far above what exists in this dungeon. Can you cry a bit more about it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Example : Girdle of Arrogant Downfall from ToTC Normal VS. Girdle of Chivalry (Grobbulus 25 Man Naxx)<br />
<br />
<br />
Girdle of Arrogant Downfall = iLvl 200<br />

Stats : 1261 Armor, 68STR, 76STA, Red Socket (bonus 4 strength)<br />
<br />
+37 HasteR, +41 ArP<br />
<br />
Girdle of Chivalry = iLvl 213<br />
<br />
Stats : 1293 Armor, 70STR, 88STA, Red Socket (bonus 4 haste, meaning the 4 str lost from the ilvl 200 belt is actually gained from the socket-bonus as well as an additional 2)<br />
<br />
+46hit, +60haste<br />

So all you enchanters out there you better start selling your stock now before the patch goes live. <br />

Apart from that I don't really see a problem.<br />

true. there's gonna be at least 5 abyss crystals per run here.<br />
so the prices will drop a lot.</div></div><hr />

and the higher the item lvl the higher chance you have getting 1 or even 2, i think something like that will put the price where it is ment to be</div></div><hr />

When I said purple I sort of meant the &quot;epic quality&quot; that comes along with purple. So no, purples disguised as blues wouldn't make me very happy...I just remember at 60 scrolling over peoples gear and seeing all purples was like...WOAH. I thought that was kinda cool...gave a lot of pride to having &quot;Epics.&quot; I was simply saying it's not like that anymore...and even less so after 3.2...</div></div><hr />

&quot;Purle&quot; hasn't meant anything anymore since ZG was released, you know, scrub heaven?<br />
&quot;OMG EPICS FOR CASUALS LOLOLOLOL&quot;<br />
<br />
People where saying it then and people are still saying it, 3 years later.<br />
Who cares, really, the ones that where crying then are either still playing the game thus value the subject to little to quit or they quit and thus their opinion isnt worth anything anymore.<br />
See what i did there?<br />

They won't break the game balance, since by now all people I know have at least almost full iLevel 200 epics from the 20+ Naxx runs our guild has done. Even the iLevel 213 gear won't make much of a difference, since they are inferior to Ulduar gear. I am just happy that we have a new way to gear recently 80 dinged alts or replace the few last blues on our mains. <br />
<br />
This gear won't be amazing in the pvp - mostly &quot;dedicated&quot; raiders benefit and they are mostly in iLevel213 gear by now.<br />

this instance is going to make abyss crystals worthless, and champion seal dailies are useless too, just go run the normal mode instance 30 times and get everything you'd ever want.<br />

5 hero -2 conquest per boss<br />
10 - triumph<br />
10 hero - 2 triumph<br />
25 - 2 triumph<br />
25 hero - 3 triumph<br />
<br />
Normal 5 won't drop any badges, 10 hero most likely will drop same number as 25. Also 25 normal drop 3 badges based on last boss kill isn't? So I would say 4-5 for 10/25 hard, 2-3 for 10/25 normal. 5 heroic will drop same number as now (1 per boss) just Conquest instead.<br />
<br />
5 heroic should drop new badges in some amount (at least last boss or two) to bring all that geared people to actually try it outside of daily quest. Probably won't happen...</div></div><hr />

Man... if you don't have alts covered with naxx gear... common...<br />

The only ones without naxx gear will be the ones that will hit 80 right now as I post this. And then, when 3.2 launches... then only people who hits 80 at that time won't be covered in naxx gear.<br />
<br />
That, I must remind you, it's not like Karazhan level gear from HEROIC magister's vs. SWP... btw, Magister's was a very hard 5-man (before 3.0 lolpatch), doubt this new one will be anything closer to that, except for &quot;omgawd, vehicles! I can't push buttons on a horse!&quot;.<br />

You could never see peoples skill by looking at their gear. By saying that, I can see you haven't raided long. Epics have always been fairly easy to get in this game.

Very well said!<br />
<br />
And &quot;hardcore&quot; people need to understand, that even if casuals get epics like this, it won't matter since only the best people will clear the high-end raids in a reasonable amount of time, right?

The armor pieces push the absolutes limits (go way beyond, imo) of the ilvl budgets of 213, and can be seen as superior to some if not most of ilvl 226 armor. Frankly, I'm tired of having to do Naxx to get a shot at the Torch (my guild doesn't even do Naxx anymore) or waiting for weapons that never drop in Ulduar. Yeah, I'm bitching about free loots essentially, but I'm not going to get excited about effing 461 w/ a BLUE gem slot, when the armor is perfectly itemized. Make the weapons 226, because that's essentially what the armor is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember taking the most dreadful paladin and priest trialists to MH, BT and occassionally even Sunwell and giving them BiS gear. One of the worst warlocks I ever saw had full T6 because he was carried the entire way while one of the best shaman I ever met had blues and a couple of epics at the time because he didn't get time to raid.<br />
<br />
Gear and Skill have never been related. It was dedication which was required to get the best gear, not skill.<br />
<br />
Now it takes less dedication. And in a video game, is this really such a bad thing?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually it is a bad thing.<br />
I'm sorry there are so many people that seem to be blurring the line between a normal retail game, and a subscription based one.<br />
<br />
We all do not play some random star of a console game that you pick up for 4-40 hours depending the genre; then toss aside and most likely never play again.<br />
<br />
Your character is a long-running investment. Ever-growing, ever-changing. To progress beyond max level, working for gear is nearly the only way in this game.<br />
<br />
As a long timer lover of working MMO formulas: I (and really ALL of you who pay a subscription fee for a &quot;persistent&quot; world) have an issue with Blizzard constantly pandering to an audience that feels their subscription fee means they deserve anything and everything immediately. And what really gets me, is even these people that want everything instantly then complain about the lack of content. There's a lot of time and content amidst that very gear you all were instantly gratified with. <br />
End game content in an MMO needs reason to be visited multiple times, it nearly has to be if you want the formula to work. (it is a flawed formula in many ways yes, but it does work in ways that keep people in the game.)<br />
Which would be obtaining gear from said content -&gt; to progress further in the content -&gt; onto newer content one day<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Lich King has done very little of that, save for 'hard modes'. Which even outside of hard modes, gear has to be a factor (if it's the only form of progressing your character after max level) in whether or not you can do it. <br />
Think of it this way: normally a group does not venture into Razorfen Kraul if they're only high enough level Ragefire Chasm.<br />
<br />
Now you take that concept and replace level with gear; now you have Blizzard's only way to keep a progression curve at endgame.<br />
Since they've abandoned keys. Attunements. Whatever.<br />
<br />
That's fine, make raids accessible, but at least provide a real means of progression at endgame. <br />
If we're completely throwing gear based progression out the window, and not adding a replacement.. WoW will be more broken than it's ever been<br />
Ludicrous achievements are not something viable to work for, I am sorry, they're fun and all but hardly have a place being considered endgame content. <br />

Thank goodness you are the minority. This philosophy would completely ruin the game for anyone not able to dedicate 8 of their 24 hours a day to raiding and grinding out Uber loots.<br />
<br />
Seriously elitists, wave the white flag, you've lost and casuals have won.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aleom</div><div class="date">2009-07-11, 11:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">yep, you are right it would... and so does dropping epics off every boss in a &quot;normal&quot; dungeon ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand that, I'm simply saying that the logic of having a normal mode with a 1-day lockout period (if it even has one, again we're just assuming it does) is non existent. Let's look at the facts:<br />
<br />
Normal 5-man dungeons can be reset at whim and run as often as one would like. <br />
Heroic 5-man dungeons contain a 24 hour lockout period. <br />
<br />
Why is that? To find out what makes the two different, we must identify the differing factor in them. The differing factor in them is that the Heroic version drops an epic item in the end. Therefore, it stands to reason the Heroic version contains a 24 hour lockout period for that reason. <br />
<br />
Raids be they Normal or Heroic, contain a 7 day lockout period. Well why is this? The differing factors between a 10/25-man raid and a 5-man instance (normal or heroic) are twofold: <br />
1) The number of people involved.<br />
2) The number of epics obtained within.<br />
<br />
Now since a 10 man is twice as occupied as a 5 man, we would assume that the raid lockout would be twice as long. This is not true. Since 25 man is twice and a half as occupied as a 10-man, the raid lockout would be twice and a half as along. Again, this is not true. Therefore, since the lockout period does not share a pattern with the number of people involved, the reason the 10 and 25 man versions share a lockout period must be determined by the number of epics available, which in the case of Naxx and Ulduar is several dozen. <br />
<br />
So if the normal mode of an instance has a lockout period, how long will it be? <br />
<br />
Consider that we have concluded 1 Epic = 1 day lockout and 12+ epics = 7 day lockout. Now, since we have logically connected the number of epics contained within an instance to the length of the lockout period we can figure out that IF this Normal Mode 5-man will indeed have a lockout period it MUST be more than a day but LESS than a week. <br />
<br />
I would wager that this new instance, in both normal and heroic will have at least a 3 day lockout period <br />
<br />
If it does not contain a lockout period of that length considering the logic we have just employed, then we can conclude that Blizzard has, in fact, NO method to their madness and no logic behind their lockout periods. It would be subject entirely to the illogical whims of their designers, which I find highly unlikely given their ideology on game balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On topic though, this instance is a travesty. Tune it up (a lot) or it is basically the worst piece of shit I have ever seen in any game ever. And conquest badges from a normal dungeon that takes less than 15 minutes? In an afternoons play anyone can get a piece of T8 or several pieces of i226 gear for... this... garbage?<br />
<br />
<br />
actually his &quot;uneducated accusations&quot; are quite the opposite. He like the majority of players in WoW arent the hardcore and pay for WoW BECAUSE it is a different kind of RPG that allows normal humans that have lives outside WoW to enjoy end-game content. You are quite the minority and Blizz knows this. After all they are a business and are looking to always expand their userbase... and the userbase is only expandable to what you see as the casual audience at this point. So whether you like it or not, all you can do is continue playing or quit...your OP is noted.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darthphyre</div><div class="date">2009-07-12, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ugh, its a rare instance that I want to post in these forums but sometimes I just need to.<br />
<br />
Look, its wonderful to get a chance to preview the gear/dungeon/raid etc before hand but treating it like ptr stuff is set in stone is like treating technology as inherently useful. Obviously things are gonna be buggy, over budgeted, and generally out of wack that's why its on the ptr. <br />
<br />
Also for those of you who don't know (perhaps because you didn't start playing to Wotlk or didn't notice during TBC) but this progression is normal to wow, it's happen before. In TBC you had a gap from kara (gruul/mag) to the bigger 25 mans (Eye,SSC) which was filled later by ZA (dropping near T5 gear) and later by badges and MGT (this included a T5-6 equivilant weapon which was quite OP considering) and then included badges dropping sometimes in multitude from virtually everything under the sun. <br />
It's not new, so what you have to ask yourself is how this action of making more loot available impact your immediate gameplay. If it doesn't (and I'll wager it doesn't) then what is it really that is upsetting you?<br />
<br />
I also find it sick that people on here treat each other like packaged meats in a shopping center and categorizing them as such. We're a community as a whole and whatever blizz throws at us we take as a whole. I'm not saying disagreeing on somebody's view point is wrong, but making judgements based on things like hours played, gear, Location in the world (the worst thing of them all), horde/alliance, etc. is silly and reduces the value and quality of these forums to little more than &quot;mmo-chan&quot; and I prefer to think the calibur of the people who visit this site is at least a margin higher.<br />
<br />
In the end remember that WoW is an ever evolving and changing game, well maintained for the volume of content and population size its providing services to. It's got a lot of mouths to feed and its hard to make everyone happy but they are gonna keep working at it. In addition its obvious many of you enjoy and care about it and enjoy it enough to have concerns (otherwise you wouldn't post here) so all I can say is hold tight and things will smooth out, they always do. 11million subscribers means they have to be doing 'something' right.</div></div><hr />

1- If you are a hardcore raider this shouldnt effect you in anyway or form because whatever gear you have is better than what drops in this 5-man.<br />

For me personaly i am happy with this change, i am not exactly a hardcore raider nor a casual either, i am kinda in between raiding Uld normal modes so i could use a couple of pieces from this 5-man.</div></div><hr />

^^ Well articulated. WoW is losing the subtleties that made it such a great and well balanced game. The subtle layering of gear levels is going the way of character specialization (i.e. Shadow Heals or Viable and Class specific C.C.). It appears as if buying a CD Key now also includes codes for phat loot and ePeen Viagra. Notably decreasing the difference between Porn Stars and the laymen of ePeen. Good or bad, it makes things less...worth the playtime? When you sink days of playtime into a game in order to receive a little loot, that loot is incredibly rewarding...but spending 5 minutes in lfg and 25 minutes in an instance to get comparable loot to the gear dedicated pro's earn...it trivializes the commitment of good players. Tough line to walk for blizz, but I agree with Abani that too many &quot;Marios&quot; are getting handed a flute.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm happy for the change it allows me to take my characters further now as i no longer have the time to raid due to real life. I still spend a lot of time in game but cannot dedicate the time to a raid as i may have to stop and go off for 15&gt;20 minutes to do something for my daughter. <br />
<br />
The way i see that is I am unwilling to spoil the time other's put in to raiding so i chose to stop raiding. I know real life comes first but in a hardcore or even some of the less hardcore guilds progression at the moment is everything.<br />
<br />
What most are saying is because i choose not to raid as i don't want to have to delay a raid while i sort real life stuff, the progression of my character's should suffer?<br />
<br />
At the moment one of my mains has no upgrades left open to him from what i can do. This new dungeon and the new emblem's system give's me a way to upgrade again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do players need gear for their characters?<br />
<br />
Better gear equals to better mitigation/avoidance, better damage output and better/faster healing on each spellcast. And why is all this needed? To progress further through the game.<br />
<br />
This is something that reading it seems very obvious, but most people who have posted in this thread (mainly the ones that call themselves casuals and state they don't have time to raid) tend to ignore.<br />
Gear does not equal to being better. Let's put aside the /flex factor that having good gear gives to some players.<br />
<br />
There is currently no instance in the game where a casual (casual meaning non-raiding) player will *need* ilvl200+ gear in all slots to be able to survive.<br />
The irony in this, is that Blizzard enables casual players to get higher ilvl gear, but doesn't give enough content for them to use it, not even enough for them to be satisfied with.<br />
<br />
This taken as a fact, the only players who benefit from this are people who do have enough time to raid, but not consistently. The people who want to join PuGroups when they have enough time to play, but otherwise can't join a raiding guild - even a &quot;casual raiding&quot; one.<br />
<br />
Players who they and they alone were the people Blizzard had in mind when designing WotLK.<br />
<br />
-Easier end-game raid-content with hardmodes so raiders are not let down.<br />
-10 AND 25 man versions of the same instances so it is even easier for everybody to have a look at the end game content.<br />
-Enormous changes to buffs so they match the &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; philosophy, which ofcourse derives from WotLK's design revolving around PuG end-game viability.<br />
<br />
This is how it is.<br />
<br />
I personally am very dissatisfied. I believe that hard work should be rewarded better (not talking gear, but end-game instances)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Removed whining at the end, I want this post to bring discussion, not crying (agreeing with me or not)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Higiyz</div><div class="date">2009-07-13, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've always thought of gear as a trophy that displays accomplishment/guild progression/time investment etc. Now gear represents /roll luck and not much else. <br />
<br />
And yeah, the game isn't deep enough for all the gear already commonly in circulation, I definitely agree. BC welfare gear added depth to game play by making Tier 5 content accessible to semi-casual guilds. These new layers of Wrath welfare gear aren't making anything more easily accessible in terms of gear improving progression, it's simply making the content already accessible...easier!<br />
<br />
This being said, I'm expecting 3.3 to have at least 2 raid instances with greater relative difficulty than Ulduar (and at least 1 on par) in order to stretch the game. Blizz still has some tricks up their sleeve, I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better gear equals to better mitigation/avoidance, better damage output and better/faster healing on each spellcast. And why is all this needed? To progress further through the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or maybe they could use it for PvP? and if they are not hardcore PvPers they could have fun in BGs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you suddenly only had to play soccer 5 hours a week to be as good as Pele<br />
<br />
<br />
You also wont get better or equal gear to people who raid 3-4 nights a week with this 5-man.</div></div><hr />

Got to love that supporting evidence. Sure, there's great gear in there, but... I don't think we should absolute eliminate 5-mans from WoW, right?<br />
<br />
(The rest of this post isn't directed at the quoted individual)<br />
<br />
Really, when MgT came out, my group of 4 friends and myself hopped into the place instantly and practically led general chat to victory with our fight strategies. We had an absolute blast getting through the place and laughed all the way through when we were screaming on vent how this supposed 5v5 was CCing us to the ground, or when our healer got 1-shot. It was pretty much the last memory I have of my small group of friends before three of them quit because of Wrath. Great times.<br />
<br />
My point is that 5 mans can still be fun and rewarding. When I got that Shard of Contempt from MgT on my Rogue, I knew it was awesome, but I had to work for it all the same. I eventually replaced it through my days in Black Temple, it served me well.<br />
<br />
There may be items in this 5-man that are better than things in Naxx 10 and even Ulduar 10 (though that might be nerfed), but if you really think that raiders who go 3-4 nights a week will be beat by a 5-man, then you are looking at a very narrow spectrum of raiding.<br />
If such a guild limits themselves (or cannot budget beyond) to just Naxx 10 every week, then what can Blizzard do to help them? Well, here they've got a 5-man.<br />
If the guild or any individual in that guild is angry because their Naxx 10s are becoming unimportant, then it is their fault for limiting themselves. I've done 4 bosses in Ulduar with a group that only had 1 DPSer above 2k. First time I stepped in the place as a tank, or any role whatsoever. <br />
<br />
And for those that don't want to read it all:<br />
<br />
5 mans can still be fun (if the group is light-hearted) while being rewarding, even for the semi-hardcore raiders. This instance will help out those who want to gear up alts, or just missed out on that trinket / ring last weeks from whatever raid. Those who want to complain while in their Naxx 10s (though I still do those as well!) should expand their horizons, because the alternatives out there (Maly, Ulduar, soon-to-be Coliseum) are great too while completely doable with some coordination.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry there are so many people that seem to be blurring the line between a normal retail game, and a subscription based one.<br />
<br />
We all do not play some random star of a console game that you pick up for 4-40 hours depending the genre; then toss aside and most likely never play again.<br />
<br />
Your character is a long-running investment. Ever-growing, ever-changing. To progress beyond max level, working for gear is nearly the only way in this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
This mentality is an outdated relic of classic wow, and hasn't been relevant since BC was released. Progression based on gear is NOT persistent when biannual expansions function as a gear reset. If you associate the value of your time spent playing an MMO with the quality of gear your character has, WoW will continue to disappoint you - might I suggest FFXI?<br />
<br />
In case you've been living in a cave for the last few months as far as developer comments go, the devs have realized that designing key content(raids) around tiny fractions of their playerbase(srs bsns/ilvl epeen raiders) isn't a good idea. They spend a major portion of their dev resources making raids, and they want the majority of players to be able to experience them. If progression remains flat(X months in Naxx before geared for Uld, X months in Uld before geared for Crusade, X months in Crusade before geared for Icecrown) then a lot of players won't ever see Arthas, and Blizz wants most players to get a chance to fight him. Honestly, if the idea of 'casual' players beating Arthas upsets you, just quit playing now, because it's going to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Facing facts: A successful persistent world needs a grind, needs timesinks, and it *NEEDS* long-term and short-term goals to strive for.<br />
WoW was so successful because it took these concepts and then made them accessible to a much wider audience without cheapening the experience.<br />
<br />
As for right now it looks like Blizzard is giving Mario a Flute in World 3, and he's skipping his way to World 7. <br />
(Moreso than it ever has. And I do remember the Sunwell badge gear, and Magister's Terrace. There is hardly a comparison here.)<br />
<br />
You and pretty much everyone else complaining about this issue and the upcoming badge change try to misrepresent the issue by making it seem like you ding 80 and get handed a full set of BiS Ulduar 25 epics. The gear selection for casuals is still junk compared to raiding, and the amount of effort-per-piece required to get a full set of badge items from heroics is significantly higher compared to the upgrades a single run of Naxx or Uld 25 will give someone in blues. This change just lets players who started late catch up faster - by the time they've managed to drop their last blues, most raiders who can clear current content(HM or not) will be in mostly t9/equivalent gear.<br />
<br />
tl;dr= Raiding is about experiencing the encounters, not the gear. Suck it, elitist dbags - Blizzard &lt;/3 you anymore.<br />

<br />
Seriously... think about how dumb it sounds<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG, IT is purple colored text from a 5 man instance = a 10 man instance from 9 months ago.&quot; <br />
<br />
Naxx = Serious Business apparently.</div></div><hr />

And that good feeling of getting that new shiny epic will be gone also (if it was still there;p).<br />
<br />
But yes, very good for new players/alts/casual players ofcourse. Trial of the Champion normal &gt; Trial of the Champion heroic &gt; Heroic daily &gt; Normal daily = win.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alemayehu</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, this is mainly for the whiners out there, I am pleased with this patch for many reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Flying mount reward with champion seals...didn't feel like talking to a RL alliance on Boulderfist to trade pets. Also, a nice conclusion to obtaining free money for a couple of weeks.<br />
<br />
2. MGT came early. I doubt it will be as challenging but then again this did not come out at the same time as &quot;Arthas/Icecrown/Citadel, the Final Frontier&quot; patch. Also with how easy it is to hit level 80 now (lets not even discuss the BoA flying book thing) and constant gold streams via dailies (just like SWP), I'm sure blizzard is catering to alts maybe 75% and casuals 25%. So, uh say thank you? LOL<br />
<br />
3. The 10 man trinkets, especially the one with passive armor pen is superb. For example, my feral has 2 piece 8.25, uld 25 weap, and naxx gears yet still has hateful bracers and some heroic blue trinket. Though he is capable of doing hardmodes in 10/25 man, that trinket would be a wondrous upgrade, and at the same time I would be experiencing new content/obtaining achievments. Good deal in my opinion plus a throwback to heroic MGT when people with war glaives would run MGT for the expertise trinkets, or how SWP healers still used the trinket from heroic MGT because it was amazing, etc. Basically a great way to get people into the new, lower level content.<br />
<br />
4. Conquest emblems. I have a level 80 paladin (retpvp/prot), warlock (destro) and druid (feral pve/pvp mostly). Now while they are all at maximum level (and its very easy to hit 80 now), I welcome this change. I figured out my classes quickly and became great at many aspects of them. However, since I am a Biology Major in college, I would have small breaks followed by periods where I could not even think about WoW. Substitute &quot;College&quot; with I don't know, spouse, children, emergency, career, and you have a large pool of players that are intelligent, skilled, know their class, but would prefer to work out or spend time going out rather than playing 14 hours a day, instead there have been times where I play about 9-12 a week (just raiding). Therefore, I see these changes as a way to grind rep on my other 2 80's while obtaining t8.25. That way, since I am skilled and intelligent, I won't be laughed at when I try to rejoin my guild and they have been clearing tier 9 content. Also, I feel that any person that is smart enough to figure out bosses, listens, and is a teamplayer deserves great gear. I get a chance to even out the playing field. Hard for me to compete with a 14 year old that has no responsibilities but has a whole lot of DKP :P<br />
<br />
5. You're paying $15.00 a month to have fun! Instead of worrying about what people are going to benefit from easy epics hit ulduar hard. See if you can do hard modes or even take out Algalon's a$$. Maybe geta 3v3 team together and see how high you can get you're ratings too. Maybe make money for a a week or 2, pursuing tradeskills, playing the AH, and selling cooldowns. The reason this game has been so fun for me is that I am so busy that everytime I log on I am challenged and this makes me pretty happy! If you are bored with all of these interesting developments maybe take a break and hit the gym? Patches are a lot more meaningful and enjoyable when you don't know about all the changes before hand on MMO :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now the demographic of 18-35, casual is now the dominant subscriber of the game. Every job I go to I get many casuals hooked. I play from 1-10 hours a week thats it. I have a very demanding job so I have no choice.<br />
<br />
But, we as casuals, want to have the opportunity to excel or have the chance to. In the last year many casuals were cancelling thier account due to arena team ratings and the overall amount of time required to raid ( raid, farm, 3 weeks an item in 25 mans is bs ).<br />
<br />
The last patch is perfect evidence to this happening. Almost every change has been targeted at casuals...extremely low team ratings TOC and a bunch of other changes...read the release notes. WOW's change has been happening for a year now.<br />
<br />
It gives people with low time investment because of social lives, family, work, etc the abilty to enjoy the game the same amount as everyone else.<br />
<br />
The MMO demographics have been changing and the casuals or starting to become to main subscriber. I believe we will see games start shifting this way because of the demogrpahic reports released earlier this year for MMO's. I'm happy for the shift. It's a good step.<br />
<br />
