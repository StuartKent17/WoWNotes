<br />
Patch 6.2 - Developer Interview<br />
Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/) had the chance to interview Ion Hazzikostas today. The more interesting points are below, but be sure to listen to the whole thing for context. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;120&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/xpMZNb6EWfs?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Raiding<br />
<br />
Hellfire Citadel is more linear than Blackrock Foundry, but there is still choice and variety. Once you get to the second floor, you can choose which order you want to work on the bosses before going through Mannoroth to Archimonde. <br />
There are quests like Well of Souls (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/39500-well-of-souls) that allow you to skip part of the raid after you have killed bosses a few times.<br />
Mythic Archimonde may have some interesting, unexpected, and new things happen once he is at low health. <br />
There is no requirement to have killed Archimonde on Heroic before entering Mythic. Restrictions like this have existed in the past, but they were easily bypassed by inviting any player who had killed the boss on Heroic.<br />
When the team was planning Warlords, Grommash was set up as the leader of the Iron Horde and the final boss. As they told the story and started working on Hellfire Citadel, they decided it wouldn't be a satisfying direction to go in. Players had just finished a raid zone full of Orcs and had killed another Hellscream. The real evil and more interesting character is Gul'dan and the influence of the Legion. <br />
&quot;Is Gul'dan dead or alive?&quot; - &quot;That's a good question&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Legendary Items<br />
<br />
Once you have your legendary ring, the Crystallized Fel (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127785-crystallized-fel) will drop from Archimonde on Normal or greater difficulty. This will scale up the proc and stats, allowing guilds to get slightly stronger every week. <br />
The legendary quest previously required you to get 900 legendary quest items, which means you always got some from every boss. This time around, only 33 are required. This means you won't get one from every boss, which may not feel as great but it is tuned to be slightly faster than previous collection steps. <br />
Most players should be able to collect all of the Tome of Chaos (http://www.wowdb.com/items/127115-tome-of-chaos) in a month or so.<br />
Raid loot from Garrison missions was exciting, but it devalued participation in the actual raids and undercut the reward structure. When guilds finally moved into Mythic Blackrock Foundry later in the raiding cycle, they already had several Mythic items from garrison missions already, so it wasn't as rewarding as it should have been.<br />
The bosses that dropped tokens in previous tiers dropped too many loot items in total, as the token items were separate from the normal loot. The team changed how the tier tokens were dropped in Patch 6.2, but by the time they realized bosses were not dropping enough tokens it was too late. It will be hotfixed for the new raid reset.<br />
Figuring out how old style legendary items would fit into current itemization, class balance, and how the game works today is challenging. Creating a legendary weapon that only works for some classes and specs wouldn't work well. <br />
<br />
<br />
Timewalking<br />
<br />
Timewalker dungeons are tuned to be easier on purpose, but part of the problem is that classes have so many more capabilities now. <br />
The old Shattered Halls could have a Prot Warrior tank who has no AoE threat, just tab Sundering. Situations like that made the dungeons more challenging. Most people didn't have AoE and AoE threat, so tanks couldn't hold threat on all of the mobs at the same time, making CC necessary.<br />
Some of the Timewalking dungeons are a little bit too easy right now, such as Black Morass. Arcatraz is tuned a little bit better. <br />
The team would like to expand Timewalking to Cataclysm dungeons, as well as expanding the number of dungeons covered by the system in Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
Figuring out where Timewalking raids would fit in the reward structure is a big part of what it would take to add them. If you are going to form a larger group, you may as well go and raid current content. There are a lot of questions to answer, such as who is the audience, where do the rewards fit in, should you be doing this raid instead of Hellfire Citadel, and is it something you do to gear up for current raids. <br />
<br />
<br />
Naval Missions<br />
<br />
If you fail a Naval Mission, the mission will still be there for you to try again. <br />
There aren't any plans to reduce the cost of Naval Equipment right now, but the team is keeping an eye on how players are using the items. <br />
Players want to maximize their chance of success on every mission, but the team envisioned players just countering the basic ship types and some of the threats, but not every single threat. <br />
If players feel that 500 resources are worth it for a small boost in success chance on every mission and actually buy the equipment, adjusting the costs is possible. <br />
<br />
<br />
Feedback<br />
<br />
The team hears the feedback from people that enjoyed solo play in Mists of Pandaria and found it lacking in Draenor. <br />
Part of the problem is many of the rewards out in the world were moved into the garrison. <br />
In Patch 6.2 they took steps towards fixing things by adding content to the world in Tanaan Jungle and more will be done in future content. <br />
The team has been working on Hellfire Citadel and Tanaan Jungle since November 2014, so they were limited in how they could respond to more recent feedback. <br />
The Patch 6.2 content was designed in the same mold as the original Warlords of Draenor content, so it feels like the team wasn't listening to feedback, even though they are. <br />
Things that are being worked on now will be much more to players liking and the team has taken the feedback to heart. <br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2.x with flying should be on the PTR within the next couple of weeks. It should go live not months and months from now, but some number of weeks.<br />
There are no current plans to make all of the Baleful items account wide right now, but it is something that was discussed. If you are playing in Tanaan and already well geared all of the Baleful items aren't useful for you, which doesn't feel great.<br />
<br />

Warlords of Draenor - PvP Season 2<br />
The next PvP season begins this week!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2 - Legendary Ring Upgrades<br />
Vanion's interview (http://www.twitch.tv/vanioneu) confirmed that Archimonde will drop Crystallized Fel (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127785-crystallized-fel) on Normal or greater difficulty, allowing you to upgrade your ring's stats and proc to item level 795, gaining 3 item levels each time. You can only get one per week, so it will take 20 weeks to hit 795.<br />

Battleground Spec Bug<br />
queued as shadow. loaded in as shadow (or so it said in my talents) with shadowform up, but in my spellbook i only had disc spells. my bars were my shadow bars but with disc specific spells replacing where they'd usually go (so they were all over the place).<br />
<br />
when i tried to use disc spells it said i hadn't learned them yet. i checked my mastery and that kinda confirmed i was shadow (shows in the screenshot).<br />
Yeah, there's a bug where sometimes the game pulls outdated information about your character when you load into an Arena or Battleground. We think we've isolated what's causing it and are working on a hotfix.

Raiding games that aren't MMOs - why isn't that a thing? Any thoughts? http://t.co/lwzg217tWa<br />
Very interesting question to consider. Some thoughts, though keep in mind that they're just my personal opinion... (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148122487754753))<br />
Few (no?) games focus purely on large raids (like WoW/Wildstar) largely because it's difficult to form social groups that size. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148184819335169))<br />
In MMOs, solo and small-group gameplay get people into the game so that they can form those kinds of larger social groups. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148330793660416))<br />
Any design that aims to form tight groups of 10+ is probably going to need something approachable (solo?) to start players off. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148425152958465))<br />
Instead, that kind of boss gameplay tends to find its way into less social games, like Titan Souls (solo) or Diablo (coop). (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148531730178048))<br />
That said, it certainly seems possible if a smart designer can come up with new, smooth ways for players to find each other. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/613148706955640832))<br />

Well when I send my ships on a 3 day missions I don't want that time to be wasted AND have a chance of losing both ships which would add even more time.<br />
I don't really see how 'just pump out more ships' is a normal reaction (even if it's fairly cheap with a rush order).<br />
With followers you somewhat cared for them because 'this is my treasure hunter one', 'this one is good for long missions', 'Leeroy is my favorite character'<br />

Leveling them up is not really all that slow. And some risk to the missions makes you think and plan carefully, instead of just sending a 30% mission anyway, because there just is no risk.</div></div><hr />

Expecting a 13 boss raid tier to be replaced in less than 6 months is not very realistic imo.<br />
<br />
If blizzard can produce 10+ boss raid tier every 6 months I would be ecstatic, the problem is when it becomes 10 months and 8 months is pushing it imo.<br />

If failing at a 93% mission meant having only 7% chance of losing my ship, why not. But 50% even if I have 98% success? No way. Specially since rolling the right crew in anticipation to the 4th legendary mission is a pain (9 subs now, and apparently, only Worgen and Night Elves want to be packed in a tin can).<br />

There's quite a few missions that require only one ship counter, which you can send your transport along.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, don't forget to &quot;clear&quot; the training missions; you'll get eventually a transport training mission which will give you those 500 xp.<br />

The story is ended. The final cinematic shows Yrel saying &quot;now it's time to rebuild, but we won't forget what you did&quot;. Your ring is legendary and its (slow) upgrade planned, meaning there's no ilvl progression scheduled beyond the current one.<br />
<br />
At best, we'll have a 6.3 with a minor &quot;Ruby Dragonshrine&quot; raid as a thrown bone because the expansion &quot;we want an expansion every year&quot; has again been delayed.<br />
<br />
And then, it's onward to 7.0, where alt-Gul'dan becomes alt-Lich King (because we killed alt-Ner'zhul, so he can't) AND Corrupted Khadgar (Cordana was right) team up to bring the Legion to Azeroth and we get at last summoned by the Black Prince to make our last stand (until the next last stand, that is).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't feel like it because the duration between Blizzard receiving feedback and being able to implement it is aggravatingly long. The Shiypyard and Tanaan were already too far into development to allow major overhauls without setting development back ages by the time they learned how players felt about WoD a few months after release. That's what the quote is saying; Blizzard's heard and is working on working with the feedback players have provided, but 6.2 doesn't feel that different from 6.0 and 6.1 because it wasn't possible to make as big changes as they'd have liked to in the time frame.<br />
<br />
Of course, when you consider the fact they were getting feedback back in Beta we've only just started to see hints at them taking notice of now, it kinda makes their statement less powerful. Almost a year ago they were getting feedback, which means even starting Tanaan in November should have had some feedback from Beta in it.<br />
<br />
<br />
My hope for a return to form still exists, but the experience of how poorly they swung the pendulum from WoD has got it flickering like a candle. We'll see. I thought good things were coming when they said they'd heard the feedback supporting 5.1's daily-rep-story system but what we got was the Garrison Campaign, so they obviously aren't perfectly in touch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Issue was and the need for CC was the tank couldn't take the damage dealt out by everything. Atleast in the beginning. You also had to figure out how to pull a group of ranged and melee trash and back in BC there was no DK pull. They also took away warrior threat on demo shout between Vanilla and BC. Guess they forgot that they took some of the tools away from warriors vanilla to BC. <br />

As for the shipyard, i think the rewards are underwhelming for the duration of the missions and the risk of losing ships (It's not about attachment, it's about the multi-day missions you have to send the ships on to get them levelled), the HfC cache has a list of things to counter a mile long (Only really stand a chance with epic ships of all ship types and ship parts unlocked), getting 1000 Apexis crystals isn't really exciting when i can get 1500 for one Tanaan-daily and 100G for a day or two is outright pathetic.</div></div><hr />

If this is true, Blizz hasn't been playing attention at all. The entire follower mission system was designed that way, so why would they assume suddenly people are going to stop doing what they've learned, especially since their ships can be destroyed if they fail?</div></div><hr />

Nowhere, but the fact remains that this game as it is now is a singleplayer game unless you decide to go for Arena, RBG or Mythic Raids. They don't seem to care at all for anything else other than endgame.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I was thinking when he said that in the interview.<br />
<br />
They're already aware that players min-max to hell with Follower missions, even making mods like Master Plan to min-max for them, only to turn around and think <br />
<br />
&quot;You know, maybe if we make a new type of follower mission that has a chance to LOSE THE BOAT if you fail the mission and costs a ton of resources to re-equip the replacement, players won't bother min-maxing&quot;<br />

Yep.<br />
<br />
I'm mostly a Normal mode guy myself, maybe a Heroic pug if it's an easy wing. But I know some friends who are mainly with LFR, and I have a guild with many LFR players and a good chunk have already left because of the changes thus far, I'm not sure if the others will stick around with the LFR design of 6.2 as well.<br />
<br />
I concur entirely with what you say, Blizzard has lost a grip on how to make people do content. They need to entice or make the environment seem more appealing (or accept that some people just AREN'T interested in it).<br />
<br />
But instead of adding appeal to entice, they try to remove appeal or punish people for doing the alternatives, so they feel coerced into doing the other content instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree with this statement, I find getting raid loot from follower missions very exciting as it's been the only way I've been able to gear up! My &quot;luck&quot; with drops has been abysmal so far and without the follower mission items I'd be well and truly screwed. <br />
Also, as I don't raid Mythic, it's allowed me to remain competitive in a guild where we have a number of members that do higher difficulty raiding in addition to guild raids, so they come in with heroic and mythic gear; so with the heroic and mythic loot from missions I (and other guild-raiders only) are able to be on a more even playing field with those pugging raiders. <br />

Ultimately I'm of the opinion that follower loot rewards have been one of the stronger features in WoD (mind you that isn't saying a whole lot, relatively speaking).</div></div><hr />

They put Help Wanted ads on the friggin launcher, the open jobs on their website is well over 100. For a company that size, with that name recognition, to have that many open jobs, and seemingly unable to fill them is remarkable to me. No one, who wants to work in the gaming business again, will ever say it openly but there is some reason why people don't want to work at Blizzard.<br />

Considering the way subs are going so far this year, i would think Blizz would want to hang on to even the lowly LfR-subs like me (maybe claim that the nigh-inevitable U-turn on current policy was &quot;one of those things they couldn't change in time for 6.2&quot;?), but upgraded Tanaan gear beats LfR-gear (I had a 695 weapon the day 6.2 released, and weapons are the single biggest upgrade for a raid tier), so the lot of the anticipation is gone by now, the gear is butt-ugly, the bonuses are laughable, none of the rotation-changing trinkets are in LfR, so the &quot;bully them into normal+&quot; policy seems to be in full effect, and experience has shown that people who run LfR will sooner leave than go into the mire of PuGs and raid-guilds...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep. The shipyard is barely a competent mobile-type game let alone a feature in a AAA 7+million player MMO. It's honestly embarrassing, I have no idea how it was approved for release. <br />
You can lose a ship in a sub-100% success rate mission, have to constantly buy and swap ship &quot;gear&quot;, and for what? I guess we should be glad it's not required content aside from building the thing. <br />
For my part I keep doing the stupid missions because of the fear that suddenly they'll start dropping good rewards (see the heroic and mythic loot rewards from followers), and leveling ships is so slow, I want to have some ready should such a scenario come to pass. Which is atrocious game design and product strategy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If blizzard can produce 10+ boss raid tier every 6 months I would be ecstatic, the problem is when it becomes 10 months and 8 months is pushing it imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said anything about expecting a replacement tier/patch in less than 6 months, only that the way the patch seems to have been set up is the devs expect it to engage an average player for about 6 months assuming of course they partake in raiding. Rather what I'm trying to point out is how ridiculous that thought is with the amount of content introduced in the patch being at an all time low and extremely unrewarding to repeat.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, it's meant to keep you busy until the next expansion, which can't be before at the very least spring 2016. If they announce both the expansion and beta open at Blizzcon.<br />
Firstly that last sentence is a very hopeful statement. Secondly I probably should've said at least 6 months rather than about considering how atrocious RNG can be to the average player when granting legendary items. Either way at least 6-7 months puts us in January and no way is anyone who is not absolutely clueless/braindead will still be playing this patch at that point if no further content is introduced until the next expansion. The ring upgrade item is hardly a big enough incentive and is honestly a fairly boring, tedious reward and unlike SoO, which went on far too long, the raid doesn't grant items or equipment that assists players in future expansions and make them want to keep raiding after they are geared.</div></div><hr />

RNG is even worse than ever with the demotion of sockets and removal of reforging. <br />
I was saying in guild chat yesterday that I haven't had a single piece of gear with a socket since dungeon blues, and a guildie helpfully pipes up with &quot;sockets aren't rare, I have 3 on this character alone!&quot; (and that was an alt, her main has sockets on most pieces).

Like I said, follower mission loot is the *only* way I've been able to remain competitive. Without it, I'd probably still have mostly Highmaul gear, and a good chunk of it at 655. <br />

That's how it plays for every single expansion so far. 12 to 14 months of absolutely nothing new (save Ruby Dragonshrine, once) until the X.0 patch.<br />

And as I said, this patch has every indicator of being the last one. Of course, if you ask, they're not going to come out and say outright &quot;yea, it's the last raid&quot;. They say it, and 5% of their population unsub within the week, and they start to hemorrage 5% per month after that. Better get 1 or 2 additional months of subs.</div></div><hr />

The ring upgrade thing also drops on normal and heroic archimonde, which will slowly make guilds stronger (aka slowly make mythic easier). I think this ring upgrade also points to HFC being the last raid of WoD.<br />
<br />
But I know what you're saying. Once you have cleared the last boss of the expac on the hardest difficulty, any additional gear doesn't really serve much purpose, since it will become obsolete on next expac release anyway. Which is why I found it weird that people complained that mythic Archimonde only drops 735 weapons for certain classes... if your raid already farms the hardest boss in the game, why does it even matter?<br />

<br />
You can basically sum up your post with: &quot;I like free loot.&quot; Well, that's great.<br />
<br />
If you'd still be in normal highmaul gear if it wasn't for caches, it means you hardly raid or don't try to get geared, so why should you get rewarded?<br />
<br />
Apexis 695 ilvl.<br />
<br />
Arena gear 700 base ilvl and takes 0 effort to farm.<br />
<br />
Normal HFC easily puggable to 12/13 on 1st week of release.<br />
<br />
But no, removing caches from higher than the difficulty you raid on somehow removes your chance at being 'competitive' (???)</div></div><hr />

1: And so I gather all those we are hiring ads from Blizzard and just an illusion then?<br />
2: Every programmer knows that they can never get their program 100% bug free that is why they have Alpha &amp; beta testers to help them find the errors and even then they can still miss some.<br />
3: Animation is not as easy as you think it is and if an animator can get away with using that was used before they will..<br />
4: That is subjective some people liked those tiers and other didn't, and they may have the best artists, they may have to follow what they are told to by the higher ups and if that is so then they are limited in what they can do..<br />
5: That all depends on what is going on over there and the only ones who do are themselves..<br />

When guilds finally moved into Mythic Blackrock Foundry later in the raiding cycle, they already had several Mythic items from garrison missions already, so it wasn't as rewarding as it should have been.<br />
<br />
I think that stinks. Most people were not getting 8-10 pieces from caches that seems way too high, but eliminating the garrison bonus altogether imho is only justifiable for mythic.<br />
<br />
I think it's fully acceptable to see LFR or normal raiders get a few pieces of next tier raid caches from garrison missions. They were not getting 8-10 from missions.<br />
<br />
Even from someone who ran several alts through LFR the amount of normal caches they got was nowhere near 8-10 pieces.</div></div><hr />

I never really liked Rift, but mentoring and instant adventures scaling you down to the appropriate level are great features.

<br />
Nothing about RPG, nothing about removal of content, nothing about PvP (I don't care about that, but many do), nothing about game direction.<br />
<br />
Which also explains why current design philosophy is &quot;raid or die&quot;. Ion doesn't understand that there used to be more to WoW than just raiding and it wasn't just raids that kept players playing. He should be demoted back to lead raid designer from lead game designer - that's what he's good at and what he cares about.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slaphappy</div><div class="date">2015-07-01, 07:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep.<br />
<br />
I'm mostly a Normal mode guy myself, maybe a Heroic pug if it's an easy wing. But I know some friends who are mainly with LFR, and I have a guild with many LFR players and a good chunk have already left because of the changes thus far, I'm not sure if the others will stick around with the LFR design of 6.2 as well.<br />
<br />
I concur entirely with what you say, Blizzard has lost a grip on how to make people do content. They need to entice or make the environment seem more appealing (or accept that some people just AREN'T interested in it).<br />
<br />
But instead of adding appeal to entice, they try to remove appeal or punish people for doing the alternatives, so they feel coerced into doing the other content instead.<br />
<br />
I'm an LFR hero, and I'm not upset with the trash loot and the long release schedule. I've been a dps player since BC and mostly a non-raider, so I'm used to being treated like an afterthought.<br />
<br />
With that said, I agree with what's being said in this thread more as a disturbing trend of Blizzard on how it views LFR in WoD. First of all, any backlash Blizzard gets from, LFR loot is well-deserved, since it's always harder to take something away than to put it back in. Remember the backlash in cata 5-man heroics when it was a lot harder than Wrath at launch AND they did not offer even epics for valor while tier gear AND epics were offered in Wrath? Blizzard is repeating the same mistakes in WoD LFR that it did with Cata 5-man heroics, and it's disturbing because it shows Blizzard does NOT learn from their past.<br />
<br />
This leads to another disturbing trend: Blizzard's stubbornness in trying to corral people into pre-made raids. I think MMO-C's own armory surveys shows that on average, twice the number of people kill LFR bosses at least once compared to normal. Even if we assume that all normal raiders kill LFR bosses at least once so that nearly half of all LFR people are normal raiders, it still shows that LFR is by far the most popular endgame content in WoW. <br />
<br />
But at the same time, Blizzard is trying push normal while trying to crush LFR into the ground almost, and it just doesn't make any business sense to devalue your most popular content. It's as if McDonald's was cutting their Big Macs in half while keeping the price the same in order for them to push their more expensive new menu items.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My Enhance Shaman has also yet to see a raid outside of LFR, I still keep trying and hoping a guild or pug will give me the chance haha.<br />
<br />
I've been playing a demo lock as my main since BC, and I also have never gotten a chance on pugging a raid on him, might killed a total of 3 or 4 raid bosses on my lock before LFR. I had to join a raiding guild on my resto druid. <br />
<br />
Oh well, I've stopped trying to get in raids in mid-MoP anyways, since it's my belief that LFR (or another form of automatic matchmaking content) is the wave of the future and pre-made raids will continue to die off. Don't get me wrong, pre-made raids would still have value, but it will be more and more a niche content for the few.</div></div><hr />

Thunder Clap's main functionality was for snaring and as the Tanks had much lower threat modifiers back then with the Sunder Armor having the highest coefficient for threat generation that would prevent the mob from going after a mage that shot a Fireball. Additionally, cleave had much less threat generation than Heroic Strike, so back then it was not feasible to use Cleave.<br />
<br />
You could not use Bloodlust/Heroism in fights before 5 minutes due to the tanks having have to build-up enough threat. Then, Wrath came and boosted the threats for tank specs and pre-Cata patch gave vengeance with Blizzard skyrocketing the threat to damage ratios for tank specs.<br />

Pretty much... now they will release more frequent expansions... of this rushed shitty quality and featuring only 2 raid tiers.

They've been saying they're going to do quicker expansions for 3-4 years now. Essentially, since around the end of Cata. They've been saying they listen and learn for even longer.</div></div><hr />
