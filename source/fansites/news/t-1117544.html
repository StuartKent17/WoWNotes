Battleground Preview: Silvershard Mine<br />
Silver Shard Mine is an upcoming battleground located in Stranglethorn Vale. There are minecarts that take off from the center of the map and head to three different supply chains. As they are on the way to the depot, you can capture them in the same way you capture points in Eye of the Storm. <br />
<br />
Both factions try to capture the cart before it reaches the end of the line, but there are checkpoints along the line that can be channeled to switch the direction the cart will go from left to right, giving your faction time to reclaim it.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer - As usual, this is WORK IN PROGRESS. The video and screenshots do not reflect the final version of the battleground. <br />

Patch 4.3.4 Live This Week<br />
We haven't talked about it much, but Patch 4.3.4 will be going live this week with two main changes. <br />
<br />
BattleTags<br />
The first change is the addition of BattleTag support in the UI. Unfortunately there does not appear to be any way to add a player by their BattleTag at this time. <br />
<br />
In the current state on the PTR, a player can add a friend by their BattleTag in the Diablo III beta, and then interact with that friend on the WoW PTR servers. This means that players may be able to add friends in a similar manner through the Diablo III game once it is released on May 15th, but will be unable to do so until then.<br />
<br />
New Support Options<br />
The second change is the addition of additional support options, such as reporting a player for their name or cheating from the target frame, rather than just the friends list or manually filling out their name in a ticket. The GM ticket UI now also allows you to submit bug reports and suggestions in game rather than on the forums.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
With the upcoming World of Warcraft Patch 4.3.4, there will be a few changes to the way you interact with Customer Support in the game. We are implementing brand new interfaces to report harassment, naming violations, and potential cheating. By building these reporting methods directly into the game client, you can automatically gather information on who you are reporting and what you're reporting them for. In addition, we've also added options to report bugs and submit suggestions for World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Reporting a Player<br />
If you encounter a player using an offensive name or foul language, violating our chat policies, or cheating, you can quickly right-click on their name in chat, and select Report Player For. If you have the character targeted, you can right-click their portrait and select Report Player.<br />
<br />

<br />
Submitting a Bug<br />
If you have stumbled upon a bug, you can report it to the World of Warcraft Development &amp; Quality Assurance teams, directly through the Customer Support window. In the Customer Support interface, click Submit Bug and fill out the requested information. <br />
<br />
Note: If a bug has seriously affected your character in a way that requires Game Master intervention (lost items, reputation, raid progress, etc.), Open a Ticket so we may investigate the situation.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Submitting a Suggestion<br />
If you wish to provide feedback to the World of Warcraft team, you may do so directly through the Customer Support window. In the Customer Support interface, click Submit Suggestion and fill out the requested information. Be sure to be as specific and constructive as possible. <br />
<br />
Note: By submitting a suggestion, you confirm that the suggestion is your own idea, the idea is not confidential, and you permit Blizzard Entertainment to use the idea publicly with no obligation to compensate you.<br />

Amount of Changes in Mists of Pandaria<br />
This is a really tricky space for class designers to navigate. We see a lot of &quot;why won't you fix my issues?&quot; pleas mixed in with &quot;I don't want to relearn how to play.&quot; Neither opinion is right or wrong of course, and there is a lot of subjectivity about what each mean. &quot;I only wanted you to change A and B, not C and D&quot; is posted in the same thread as &quot;Please don't change A!&quot; Even the OP above had to add &quot;don't change... except for....&quot;<br />
<br />
The talent changes do give us the opportunity to clean up (in our parlance) various rotations because we now have the concept of spec spells. Previously, we often had to jump through hoops to keep players from having to use awkward yet higher DPS rotations. <br />
<br />
To use one example, we didn't want Fury warriors to have to &quot;cast&quot; Slams and most Fury warriors didn't want to either (meaning we weren't just smacking players' wrists for finding a way to play that we had not envisioned). But any time we needed to buff Slam for Arms, we risked Fury side effects unless we messed with the Bloodsurge proc for Fury to keep Slam the same for them. In Mists we can just make Slam an Arms spec spell to avoid that issue completely. There are many other comparisons, especially for rogues and warlocks who often incorporated many more buttons than they needed to do to execute a rotation just because those buttons were there. <br />
<br />
Similarly, it gives us a chance to clean up action bars a little by doing things like streamlining the number of heals non-healers need. Shadow needs some heals to feel like a priest, but it doesn't need the repertoire that a Holy priest has. <br />
<br />
But these changes, made with the best of intentions, still count as changes. Returning players, especially players returning from early Cataclysm or Lich King still have to learn them. I had a warrior player the other day ask me why he needed Heroic Throw and Heroic Leap because they were just extra buttons on his bars, yet I also imagined the outrage if we tried to prune them.<br />
<br />
We really try not to make change for changes sake (and you are free to call us on it if you think you see it). Every change is to solve some problem, likely a problem that representatives of the various classes and specs have advocated at one point or another. (Here is where players will typically say &quot;I have been an X for 8 years, and I never remember seeing someone ask for Y&quot; - please don't turn the rest of this thread into that).<br />
<br />
We have also been trying to limit large class changes to expansions and not patches, even though that policy frustrates players as well who don't want to wait many months for a more dynamic rotation or a quality of life improvement. It's a design philosophy challenge for sure. <br />
<br />
The best advice I can give you (any of you) is to offer specifics. Generic &quot;I don't like my guy anymore&quot; doesn't give us much indication of what we would have to do to get you to want to play him again. If there is a change you don't like, let us know, but be prepared to defend that position against other players who may disagree with you. We're not actually looking for players to vote on changes, but it is helpful for us to see both sides of a debate.<br />
<br />
Also remember that nearly every change at this stage is made for fun and not for balance. That means our hands aren't tied. But it also means we are making decisions based on something really subjective upon which players very possibly are not going to agree.I find the discussion really interesting, especially when it sticks to the topic of &quot;How much change is appropriate?&quot; and doesn't try and discuss every single class in one thread.<br />
<br />
I did want to clarify a few points just to make sure we are all on the same page.<br />
<br />
We haven't changed healing. Healing should feel really similar to how it felt in Cataclysm, but a little more forgiving when you're still in greens and blues.<br />
<br />
We do want to give tanks more control over their survivability, but that's because we've really toned down the effort it takes to maintain threat, so we want tanks to have something upon which to focus their attention.<br />
<br />
We also spend a great deal of effort balancing at 85. As we have mentioned before, we want everyone who logs in when the expansion goes live to have about the same amount of damage and healing that they have today in Cataclysm. The sources of some of that damage and healing will change, but overall the numbers should be familiar.

<br />
Exploiting Bugs and Glitches in Beta.<br />
I'm unable to go into specifics so I'll just say this:<br />
<br />
If you come across a bug and you want to retain your ability to test in the beta, report it and don't exploit it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220893-exploiting-bugs-and-glitches-in-beta/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4427538488?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
Ji Firepaw Feedback<br />
Thanks. Your feedback has been received. I don't think we need another 100+ pages of discussion about one line of quest text or this will end up being a very long beta.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you've contributed to this topic, it's time to move on. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220892-feedbackji-firepaw-part-huh/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4427537788?page=5#89))<br />
<br />
10 and 25 Player Raid Size Balance<br />
We'll continue making adjustments as necessary to keep 10- and 25-player raids within a relative alignment, in terms of time investment, difficulty and rewards. It may never be perfect, but we still see interest in both raid sizes for different reasons. And ultimately we'll continue designing 25-player raids as long as there are a decent number of guilds interested in the format. We've seen no evidence as of yet that such interest is waning to any degree that should cause us great concern.<br />
<br />
We tend to begin raid design around 25 players anyway before tuning for the various sizes and difficulties. That, when combined with our intent to carry on with 25-player Raid Finder group sizes, makes it very much worth our time to continue designing 25-player raids.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what players' personal preferences or opinions are regarding the varied raid formats in World of Warcraft, we don't see removing options as a smart choice in the foreseeable future. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220882-rumors-about-25-mans-please-no-blizz/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4427708031?page=21#412))<br />
<br />
Faction Favoritism<br />
You act as though I don't think there's any disconnect at all, or that all complaints from Alliance players about perceived story imbalances between factions are baseless.<br />
<br />
These are fallacies which, as with this one below from you, I was initially biting my thumb at in my post you quoted.<br />
<br />
The frustrating thing, though, is that you haven’t just received criticism, but constructive criticism as well. Plenty of people have offered copious amounts of suggestions since even before the release of Cataclysm, and you’ve ignored every single one.<br />
You do everyone on the forums, yourself included, a disservice by making the leap in logic that, because we didn't act upon feedback submitted to us, we ignored it. Many of the suggestions you referenced in your post would've been pretty massive undertakings toward further redesigning the 1-60 experience in Cataclysm. From your point of view, and given how you feel about Alliance design, it's probably a pretty easy call. The decision should've been to make those changes to better flesh out the Alliance and, in particular, worgen story.<br />
<br />
But we don't get to do this over, so we have to look at it from a pragmatic standpoint. Regardless of what we know today, it still would've been an incredible risk back then to delay the expansion, just to further redo the 1-60 experience to ensure the Alliance portion cannot be seen as anything other than equivalent (at least) to the Horde portion, in terms of quality. This is not to mention that, to a sadly large extent, the revamp of the 1-60 experience went pretty unnoticed to the average player. The average player has been more concerned about a lack of content at level 85 than what zone story lines ended more in favor of the Horde than vice versa.<br />
<br />
And since we weren't going to change the expansion's story partway through purely based on the concern that players didn't feel Thrall was a neutral enough character, we went ahead with our plan.<br />
<br />
Now enter Mists development. For months now we've been listening to the Alliance concerns on all types of matters, from lore, to faction pride, to populations, to behavior at BlizzCon, etc. And so many of them are legitimate. We've taken a lot of this to heart while developing the next expansion, while also building upon the larger story that's sure to span many more expansions and even new games (hopefully) down the road.<br />
<br />
But then these valid concerns get whittled away and almost lose their meaning as they're put on this tit-for-tat list, where they're used as emotional leverage. And suddenly every little piece of information that comes out regarding future content gets ripped apart to determine exactly where our true motivations and biases lay. It actually increases the social divide between players, inflames the loudest people on both sides of the aisle, and prevents us from getting any reasonable word in edgewise without being cut down for our perceived ignorance in all matters relating to Alliance player wants/needs, if not our malicious attempt to outright make the Horde the cooler faction by story and design.<br />
<br />
While both sides have done some pretty great and pretty terrible things in the stories past, there's a reason we don't make one the definitively evil or definitely good side (don't point to a few moments on a recent timeline to refute this point -- I'm talking big picture). Playing with friends aside, it's still a goal of ours to make sure that you're playing whatever faction and race you think is coolest, or which one you identify with or enjoy most. To think we're actively designing the game any other way is to get caught up in this debate so much so that you lose sight of what the game is all about.<br />
<br />
I'm proud to be all gnome when it's time to crawl dungeons with my Alliance friends. I'm excited to represent goblins when it's time to collect bounties with my Horde friends. That said, my ultimate affinity is for my gnome and the Alliance, if not purely because that's how I ultimately jumped on the Warcraft train.<br />
<br />
And I'm sure plenty of you out there would spit on both of those races. And -- since these words have never come back to bite anyone in the past -- I say bring 'em on.

So, dear WoW players, playing beta, remember one thing. If you encounter something that bothers you, and many more players, in any way, ignore it. We don't accept advices from players playing beta. Therefore, Ji Firepaw dialogue change and Brewmaster to Lamemaster conversion will remain. So STFU, QQ more.<br />

Blizz has stated numerous times that just because there is a chat filter, it doesn't give you freedom to swear. You can have action taken against your account if you are reported for violating the ToS, which includes swearing in public channels. It looks like this system is just in place for beta, but if it goes live, I wouldn't be surprised if a large number of players get some well deserved timeouts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I wonder why they've been so snippy lately... could it perhaps be that the blue posters have had enough of the endless disrespect they receive day in and day out and are growing tired of the countless rudely worded questions they're constantly being asked?<br />
<br />
Besides, the &quot;feedback&quot; on Ji was getting ridiculous. WAY too much time and discussion being spent on that 1 NPC when many other things need just as much, if not more, conversation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. But there are many ways to say &quot;It's over and there is nothing we can do more.<br />
<br />
Way 1. &quot;Thank you for your feedback. We really appreciate it. However, we are unable to return to previous quotes, because a group of players realised, that they may be offensive, and in a way that is against the law. We are glad you liked the previous concept more, but we can't do much more. I hope you will enjoy the game regardless of the change&quot;<br />
<br />
Way 2. &quot;Thanks. Your feedback has been received. I don't think we need another 100+ pages of discussion about one line of quest text or this will end up being a very long beta. Whether or not you've contributed to this topic, it's time to move on&quot;<br />
<br />
Way 1: We apologise, but theres nothing we can do<br />
<br />
Way 2: Shut. Up. Already.<br />

<br />
I've been looking forward to this one for a bit, I always enjoyed payload maps in other games. I was really hoping when I first saw those railway tracks up above that maybe we would get some overlapping cartlines, but it looks to be a little simpler.<br />
<br />
Don't know if anybody else noticed but it looks like there ledges you can climb up if you're a ranged to stay safe while you follow the cart. Guessing you won't be able to capture it from down there.<br />
<br />
I'm a little confused tbh. Maybe I'm being thick but I don't really get how it all works. The description said there were three supply chains, but I counted 4 - The snake statues, the oil, the lava and the generic looking place where we started/finished the tour. Are the supply chains Alliance/Horde specific? If so, I'm not sure how it would work. One route could be from the oil to the lava, that seems about equal distance from the middle, but the others don't seem equal at all. Can we only change the direction of the cart at these &quot;checkpoints&quot;? I'd always imagined you could grab the cart anywhere. <br />
<br />
The elevated room is clearly the starting areas, there's another one north that we didn't visit in the video. We also didn't see that area in the central far east of the map, it looks quite large, but had no tracks going towards it. <br />
<br />
Hoping to get some actually speculation and discussion about gameplay going on. Little chance I know. Will probably end up talking about Ji Firepaw again because that's all the WoW community care about now.</div></div><hr />

If something in a game offends me after reading the esrb then its in no way against the law. It might be bad P.R. But either way its a stink. There are a lot of things in wow that can be offensive. Trade chat( ty ignore) from players. Slavery, racism, sexual jokes, murder, rape, torture, language, the treatment of peons as dumb idiots, mutiliation of dead soldiers, mass genocide of animals (peta), and probably a mass more of things in game including sexism. Most of these things offend people in the real world but if we were all to say we are offended by them in this virtual world then we might as well not even have World of Warcraft or any game that is not idk Tetris?<br />
<br />
And no im not saying if you are offended that you should quit. That is your choice to play a game that could offend you....we do not force you to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
look up Samwise Didler and Greg &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; 2011 blizzcon alliance song if you want to know why<br />
<br />
The CEO of Blizzard actually released a press release a week after Blizzcon 2011 in regards to the incident, apologizing to the LGBT members of the Blizzard fan community.<br />
<br />
And of course in typical fashion, many horde players went &quot;lol alliance babies cried enough,&quot; completely missing the point.<br />
<br />
And LGBT Horde hence clawed at their faces, wondering why people are so fucking stupid.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Im just afraid about this report system that some stupid kids will play and they dont get the item and report you for cheating because you won not him, same with bad language someone swear in game and kid or some stupid ass report him, because really most of people dont read terms and condition and after something happen they suprise.<br />
<br />
(sorry for my bad english)<br />
<br />
Every report is thoroughly researched/investigated before an account action is carried out. And winning loot rolls over others has never gotten someone banned. <br />
<br />
If it was an instance of you putting it on master looter, telling someone in the party that you'd distribute items based on /roll results, then they win the /roll but you took the item for yourself.... THAT would result in account action as there would be an in-game reference to you pledging to do otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just wonder how far &quot;we&quot; will be allowed to go with the report option.... On my realm back on wotlk, there was a player named Jack, or James, or something close to that. There was this 2nd guy that everyday &quot;allegedly&quot; reported him and spammed trade channel about it being the name of is recently decease father, and he couldnt play normally when he saw that character as he disturbed him (lolwut). We all dismissed him as a bad troll at start but then someone found out that players blog where we found out he did indeed lose his dad recently.... but still.... No clue on what GMs did, the whole premiss was enough to puzzle me..<br />

Thanks. Your feedback has been received. I don't think we need another 100+ pages of discussion about one line of quest text or this will end up being a very long beta.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you've contributed to this topic, it's time to move on. &quot;<br />
<br />
So, dear WoW players, playing beta, remember one thing. If you encounter something that bothers you, and many more players, in any way, ignore it. We don't accept advices from players playing beta. Therefore, Ji Firepaw dialogue change and Brewmaster to Lamemaster conversion will remain. So STFU, QQ more.<br />
<br />
Seriously, sometimes Blizzard acts like bigger jerks than those elitists on LFR.<br />
<br />
That's not not what I got from that at all. What I got was they acknowledged everyones feedback. They were just saying &quot;Alright, we've seen and are reviewing all the feedback you've given us. Please go find something else to give feedback on while we review what you have given us&quot;. There is I believe a 50/50 chance something may happen in the upcomming build. In the first thread alone 88.8% of all the posters (I had went through and counted each individual name for and against, an had a solid number and put them numbers into a calculator) in the first thread were for either reverting the change, or making a compromised version. I highly doubt Blizzard will ignore that. I like to remain optimistic here. And even if nothing changes, at least I gave a good fight.</div></div><hr />

She does a good job , looks great and says what she needs to say..what more could you ask for...dam jealous people.<br />
I agree that Pico gets way more flak than she deserves, but she does have some room for improvement. She sounds like she speaks from her upper throat, which ends up sounding a bit flat. Speaking from the back of the throat, I would bet she could get better range and probably sound a bit less young.</div></div><hr />

More than half of the reports are going to be fake, pvp anger related and all. Like the instant kick afk report that blizzard and everybody pretend is a bug, while it's fully functional and has been coded willingly by Blizzard, kicks you on the spot if 3 person reports you afk, even if you are in combat. Except the first few times where you have the debuffs, if you have never even been reported afk since 4.1. Once you have gone through that a couple of time, your account is permanently flagged (which means there is a space in the database that store this information, thus it is not a bug, and instant kicks replace any debuffs.<br />
I'm only hoping that people are going to be banned for making fake reports too. No such luck. They don't do that for people sending fake reports about people being away from their keyboards...</div></div><hr />

It's just the times we live in now. Blizzard is only getting up-to-date.<br />
<br />
Report on your neighbor. If you see something, say something. Don't like someone's name? Report it. Someone pissed you off? Report them. Someone offended you? Report them.<br />
<br />
As much as I hate the new report system it's fitting for the current generation of whiners and complainers who want everything their way. Just always look behind you, because someone is reporting you to the authorities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they need to add AOE reporting however. Maybe in 6.0?</div></div><hr />

How can you possibly cheat on a online game bar botting? The reason i ask this is because i once was up against a funny looking suspicious team in a WSG and they camped us within a inch of our life but seemed to be extremely powerful,only to be told that they were a russian team by a GM,and thats all the help i got,a bunch of russian cheating barstools!</div></div><hr />

(an &quot;e&quot; in the middle makes all the difference i guess..)<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually Molster could be his last name... it is kind of common<br />

I am sorry, but Pico is still completely awkward to watch.<br />
I get this impression she is completely terrified to be on camera. That or she doesn't get to review the script before they are recording.<br />
<br />
I think she is bad CGI</div></div><hr />

Or did they just recycle the old Wailing Caverns map, change some of it a little, and slap a battleground tag on it? And by that I mean the map display.<br />
<br />
Not sure we watched the same video or the same pictures. Are you so fixated on finding reused art assets that your imagining things now? <br />
<br />
Looks like a fun dynamic BG.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I doubt that.</div></div><hr />

HOLD on there knee jerk Kenny. Nothing extra is being added to this system. This is just a slightly easier and more coherent way to report a player that divides it better so that the support team can deal with them better. You can already report players for misconduct, for, ANYTHING really. That option has ALWAYS been in WoW. You can right click on ANYONE's name prior to this patch and click report player. All they did was make it more streamlined and organized. <br />
<br />
Your knees are safe....for now...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danavos</div><div class="date">2012-04-17, 10:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously why so much complaining about factions. I'm pretty sure your fishing for a &quot;perfect&quot; game by trying to get everything you want. If it were as easy to complain and get what you want, do you realize what this game would be like right now? lol I'd throw out a guess and say warriors and rogues would have mace stuns if we had our way. Point is, it doesn't matter how long you have been complain or what exactly your complaining about nowhere does it say they have to fix it just because it may be popular to complain about cause there are some other topics for the game that may or may not be faction related that can get a large amount of &quot;fix this!&quot; complaints.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deepone</div><div class="date">2012-04-17, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of thoughts:<br />
<br />
1) interestingly, I (and probably others) suggested a BG layout like this years ago on the old suggestion forum. Glad to see they're getting to it. I think what I suggested was similar: something like a spoke-and-hub pattern of tunnels where each team starts at a random tunnel end-point. The goal is to control 3 spokes (ala AB), but since you have to go through the center to get to any spoke except the one where you started, there's an obvious sort of race that happens....<br />
<br />
2) On the spec-spells. It's a good model. Rift uses the same sort of model, where you select 3 specs to &quot;slot&quot; out of a list of 8, and then you pick up the spells associated with each spec you chose (the more points you spend, the more of the spec-specific spells you get, regardless of which talents). That's a bit different, but I see WoW generally moving toward the Rift model in a number of places (AoE loot, spec spells, &quot;instant adventure&quot;, more world events, etc.) It's a good thing. MMOs should learn from each other's successes and failures.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2012-04-18, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously, try this report feature out. I'm betting their CS department handling the Bad Name thing tonight is overwhelmed. A person can sit in trade and report everyone they don't like with no ramifications. Someone from the Never Think Things Through Department strikes again!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SXSWFun</div><div class="date">2012-04-18, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No 64 bit version of the client. Not responding/giving a dang about our feedback. Lip Service. No invite to the beta despite buying an Annual Pass. Ridiculous and funny looking panda characters.<br />
<br />
It's a bummer! Must be declining subs again.</div></div><hr />
