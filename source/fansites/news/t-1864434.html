Armory Stats - Flying Achievements<br />
With flying finally here, we are checking back in to see how players are doing on unlocking flight. You can see the numbers from last month here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5089-Armory-Stats-Flying-Achievements-August-14-Hotfixes-Blue-Tweets-HS-TGT-Cards).<br />
<br />
The sample used today is 1.8 million players (not characters) that have logged in since August 15th. Only level 100 characters are included in the data. Characters are grouped by player, so no matter how many characters a player has, they only count once.<br />
<br />
We included the 200 Treasures achievement just for comparison purposes, only 100 is required for Master Treasure Hunter (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10348-master-treasure-hunter), which is required for Draenor Pathfinder (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10018-draenor-pathfinder).<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Funny how and are ignoring #RavenholdtOrRiot Almost as if they know they're wrong but are too stubborn to change.<br />
Appreciate feedback, and hear you, please try to keep your comments positive, and wait until full reveals. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/641115537309720576))<br />

Why was the drop rate of Val'anyr fragments lowered so much?<br />
It hasn’t been touched in years (if ever) – sounds like bad luck. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/641358283001884674))<br />

Last LK Timewalking cache for me was Heroic, this time it was Normal. What gives? I've only done more H kills since then?<br />
Maybe you’re thinking of the Draenor dungeon holiday? Timewalking gives a Normal cache; Draenor Mythics a Heroic one. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/641358151611125760))<br />

<br />
The guildies that asked were regular socials, so frequently logging in. Only conversations I've seen in g-chat about flying was in the beginning of WoD, people hitting lvl100 asking where to buy flying :P And around the time when Blizzard changed their mind about it. Never any lengthy conversations, could easily be missed by those not online at those particular moment.s</div></div><hr />

Yes, yes it is. It's renewed my interest in running the Tanaan grind on alts, archeology and it's made levelling my newest alt through Draenor more enjoyable. I understand the whole immersion argument, but after doing something several times the sense of immersion wears off, and anything that can ease the tedium is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As someone with many sub-100 alts and two that need Tanaan, there is enormous value in flying. I can cherry pick every encounter. Immediately reach most items that were stuck behind some super mario jump or goblin glider puzzle. I quickly access remote quest waypoints with minimal hassle. I'm not constrained to flight paths. On my main, its a mild convenience; on the rest, it is literally game-changing.</div></div><hr />

You must be shocked that Blizz continues to bother with raids then... Remember back in the BRF days when MMOchamp ran graphs showing that barely 30% of the players had done it on any difficulty (even LFR) and less than 1% had made any progress in Mythic... it's like a complete waste of dev time amirite?<br />

My guild had several people come back with patch 6.2.2 that did not realize how to unlock flying. And the 1.7 million accounts was the sample size, not all US accounts. I think rogues would stop going nuts if it was the Dalaran undercity and not termed as sewers. Maybe get to it through the sewers or a secret entrance that leads down from a building, but sewers is a bit much.</div></div><hr />

I used to think the same thing, but people have made it very clear to me in how adamant they are in not going anywhere that they don't need to. Some people just really hate anything that isn't required. I don't get it, but then again I love getting achievements in the first place, personally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it works like that. The maximum value across the different brackets will act as an upper bound to the percentage of players with Draenor Pathfinder. If we look at the numbers we see that &quot;Loremaster of Draenor&quot; is at 57%, so if all the those people completed the rest of the achievements then that 57% would be the percent of people with flying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Each statistic is independent, the only one one that overlaps with all the others (except the 200 Treasures one) is Pathfinder. Pathfinder is at 28.67% and the next lowest is the Tanaan reps at 32% so that means around 4% have that but are missing at least one of the others (apparently there's been issues with the apexis daily for the Pit on the Horde side so my money is on 'Securing Draenor').</div></div><hr />

You get 1500 (1800 with Trading Post 3) rep every time the Teeth daily is up, there's a weekly quest you can do that literally takes 5 minutes, and you get a very respectable 30 rep per Saber mob killed, and 600 for rares. An hour of group grinding Sunday and I had the rep, even without a banner.<br />
<br />
Order of the Awakened is the &quot;worst&quot;, and it's really not that bad. Just pace yourself on opening Treasures around Tanaan, don't open them if you don't have the quest incomplete for that day. Rares and respawning items get you the rest.<br />
<br />
I'll be joining the club tonight, I have one Order of the Awakened turnin left to get flying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are many, many different ways to play this game. Your way isn't the only way.<br />
You don't need flying in WoD to do raids, to pvp, to play your low level twinks, to play the AH/gold game, to level alt after alt after alt, etc.</div></div><hr />

It only makes you look childish or so mentally deficient that you can't form a complete thought without resorting to swears.<br />
<br />
As for the graph, many have been complaining about Assault on the Pit. Once that pops up, the numbers will jump up maybe 2-3% (or more). There's also people who want flying but don't want to bother with reps, etc. Those people appear to count against the flying total and look like they're anti-fliers or just don't care when they're not.<br />
<br />
As for less than 30%, nearly 1 in 3 players did it. More than 1 in 4 players have done it. In the US, 1 in 3 births are by c-sections. That's significant as well as troubling. Also in the US, 1 in 10 suffer from depression. That's significant. Depending on what numbers you look at (again for the US), anywhere from 1 in 4 to 1 in 2 are living in poverty. That's significant. Many states in the US have 1 in 3 (or more!) that are overweight or obese. That's significant. Not everything has to be 50% or better to be significant. Why is it that so many care about mythic raiding when only 1% of players even get that far? How is 1% significant? It all depends on priorities and what's being looked at. Sometimes even a small percent can be significant such as the top 1% having the majority of the wealth. So the fact that 28% of players have flying is significant to many people, Blizzard included. It might not mean anything to the people who are mocking it, but it means something to other people.</div></div><hr />

I've never met a player in game who felt that flying was THE missing feature of WoD. I see a lot of complaints on forums, but I've never met anyone in game. When flying was opened up, most players in my guild flew around for 2 minutes and then went back to afking the garrison.<br />

Yes. Absolutely. <br />

<br />
Yeah, seriously. I don't think they could possibly make 1 to 90 any faster than it already is with the current set of heirlooms. At low levels you 1-shot every monster depending on your class and a single dungeon can make you gain 2-3 levels if you do the quests. I managed to do 80-85 purely in Vashj'ir in about 2 hours on a Priest. It's just boring, and additional heirlooms wouldn't change that.</div></div><hr />

They killed the sense of player progression from 1-100 with the new talent system and by showering us in heirlooms imo.</div></div><hr />

If you look at the forums it does seem the Pit daily not popping for Horde for a while is keeping quite a few back.<br />
<br />
But I'm stunned by how many people don't even have the 50 treasures achieve, let alone the 100 you need for flying. Getting 50 takes no effort at all, they just appear out and about while questing. Do ~40% of people not level by questing? Or do they just not look at anything out in the world if it doesn't pertain to the quest they're on?</div></div><hr />

You can't buy the missives for the group apexis dalies. The pit popped today for Horde after 22 days. It was the only thing I needed for flying.</div></div><hr />

Maybe its time to skip the leveling from 1-60? And revamp those areas to be max level with daily/weekly/etc quest hubs? Not sure. eh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard will likely see an increase in numbers this quarter. An increase they may or may not attribute to flying. I really think flying is playing a big part to bring more back. This time of year I usually see the end of summer drop off too.<br />

Indeed, regardless of who completed Pathfinder, insipid content is going to be a hurdle for many. I do not have the faintest idea how some can conclude that these numbers accurately represent interest in flying, even if already presuming that people to whom it was the biggest deal haven't simply moved on ages ago. If anything, considering how many in their right minds would rather avoid doing any of these achievements at all, I would sooner write it up to flying having a broad and strong appeal that 30% of the players got it by now. Sadly I suspect that means Blizzard will use it as a way to cajole players into making their dry biscuit content look appealing every expansion in this way from now on though.<br />
<br />
Personally as a Horde-only EU player that only just returned for leveling my alts by getting flight I felt headlong into the pit of a certain daily not showing up after doing what felt like an eternity of sucking up and gritting teeth on a daily basis in Tanaan. Hope those in the same boat manage to get it soon.</div></div><hr />
