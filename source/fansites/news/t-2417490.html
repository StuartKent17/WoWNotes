Blizzard has released a new cinematic about Saurfang. 
 
Watch the New Cinematic: “Old Soldier” 
The fires of war rage across Azeroth, but legendary Horde warrior Varok Saurfang wants no part in the fighting. After a lifetime spent on the front lines, he has outlived most of those closest to him, even his own son. On the eve of a battle that will determine the Horde’s fate, the old soldier must choose whether to finally lay down his axe for good.

It is early morning in Europe and early afternoon in Asia/Australia. So all in all, a little weird. It was likely pushed for earlier release due to the sheer amount of discussion after the Burning. Counter some of the bad publicity.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure that it was the highest quality CGI that they have done for WoW for any purpose. Even the BFA opening cinematic was shorter and lower def.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The BfA one was far busier however, so I'm sure it was longer and cost more to make. But yeah, totally unexpected to have such a lavish cinematic for Saurfang. It seems increasingly unlikely he just rots in the Stockades and will have a serious role to play further down the line. <br />
<br />
I do wonder if an Alliance character also gets one of those. Genn perhaps? Considering he's also the number two of his faction leader and is also present at the siege.</div></div><hr />

I'm thinking the part with the ice is Icecrown, considering he's holding the dead body of his son, Draenosh, after retrieving his body from the Icecrown Citadel.<br />
<br />
The other location is obviously Lordaeron, as the Alliance is about to attack.</div></div><hr />

This is the kinda stuff Blizzard does for a major character arc development. I got shivers from this stuff. Saurfang is likely going to be warchief of a splinter horde or something similar. Which means that Sylvanas is going to be a boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am saying this ever since I saw the Battle for the UC: they are setting Saurfang up as the new warchief. The whole &quot;honor&quot; thing and disliking Sylvanas' way about things and he being liked by so many players for so long, is a clear reason why.<br />
<br />
But after this cinematic I am certain I can put it this way:<br />
#SaurfangForWarchief</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hekazi, a nameless troll that died during the Third War.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I would be surprised at this point if he doesn't take on a major role later in the expansion. They're not going to spend the money making such a cinematic for the lulz of it, surely? <br />
<br />
I mean, Varian did get some development in the Legion cinematic only to be killed right after, so that we get this is no guarantee of Warchief Saurfang. But the last time they did an ''extra'' cinematic like that was for Mists where it was 30 seconds of two generic characters in a joke video. This is an unprecedented 6 minute fully-fledged cinematic for a particular character. You don't do that and then just toss em by the wayside even if you're Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

OBVIOUSLY Blizzard made this cinematic over the last couple of days as a response to the community backlash, and are swerving the story in another direction. Bad writing, etc etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
This was a great cinematic. I had speculated that we might see a second one since the expansion's cinematic was a year ago, but I didn't think it would be a direct prequel to it, and definitely not a Saurfang one.</div></div><hr />

Which then leads right into the battle with Sylv even saying 'we have forgotten what makes us strong.' Would be awesome to think she gave into the honourable status as in the cinematic she even YELLS for the horde after falling. I'm totally overanalyzing and trying to connect the two mentality wise but lmao doubt it.</div></div><hr />

But the last time they did an ''extra'' cinematic like that was for Mists where it was 30 seconds of two generic characters in a joke video. This is an unprecedented 6 minute fully-fledged cinematic for a particular character. You don't do that and then just toss em by the wayside even if you're Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but the tone of this cinematic makes it a great prequel for his death in any glorious battle though.<br />
Like, he's gone through too many dramatic encounters, and he was always &quot;denied his warrior's death&quot;. I'm a bit afraid he will finally get his.<br />
<br />
This cinematic is awesome and it is what we need. Unexpected high-quality lore cinematics.<br />
I don't really get the point of Blizzard though. Releasing this 2 days after Sylvanas' Warbringer kinda outshines it by like a lot.<br />
<br />
Expecting the same cinematic for an Alliance member now. Genn's reaction to the Burning with maybe the same emotional tone/flashbacks to his son's death ?</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt say that. Alliance do win in regards to the fact that they push the horde completely out of the Eastern Kingdoms. Im not 100% postive on this because im not in the beta, But i assume in BFA alliance can no longer go to Darn and horde cant go to Undercity in the sense that horde and alliance abandon both. Ones a smouldering ruin and the other is infested with a plauge so neither are inhabited and in terms of NPC's there will be none there. Which means its still a victory for the alliance in striking a blow to the horde even if the horde struck it themselves by pulling a kamikaze.</div></div><hr />

At least from the whole story telling pov I don't think its a simple case of wanting to go suicide booth, orc culture in warcraft has a element of shame about reaching old age, its why you see so few of them. plus seeing the tree go up probably made memories of atrocities back on old draenor re-surface.<br />

The graphics are nice and up to Saurfang on the field marching towards Alliance &quot;to claim his destiny&quot; I was on board. But suddenly some random made Saurfang change his mind by saying his father died. How does this change the old orcs motivation, how does it change he's commited attrocities under Sylvanas who has no honor whatsoever? It doesn't. Yet he turns on his heel and forgets all about his son, honor, regret of killing civilians. He turned from a wise, hard-willed soldier to an orc who on a whim marched to his death only to be swayed by the first non-argument someone tossed his way. What a shit-tier level writing. I have to wonder if it's because Blizzard hired inclusivity writers or what?<br />
<br />
All the characters are two-dimensional as hell:<br />
Jaina is mad at the Horde.<br />
Sylvanas is 100% evil.<br />
Anduin is 100% good.<br />
Saurfang is honorable and obedient to the Horde even though he disagrees with the Warchief (Nazgrim 2.0) . He could've been so much better of a character. <br />

In what instance has it not? As cool as WarCraft 3 was, its writing was not that great, Warcraft's writing has never been that great. Burning Crusade writing was an atrocity that butchered WoW lore for years to come, Cataclysm with the dragon aspect shit, the corny ass ending of WotLK with &quot;there must always be *LIGHTNING* a Lich King&quot;, Illidan coming back to life twice... come the fuck on.

Well this is a positive for the story of a video game where we often have to save the world. Story in games have nothing to do with stories where we're not interacting. Good vs evil is an excellent story for a game. It works all the time. mario, zelda, final fantasy, ... and stories with such stories are good too. It's when you try to be complicated for the sake of it that it's stupid. Imagine wanting mario and luigi to have ptsd because they're tortured and stuff kek</div></div><hr />

We all know (well most) what happens right afterward.<br />
They make Saurfang lose all honor and cant even bother to give this old warrior the honorble death he deserves.<br />

Na, the troll Anduin kills has grey hair, the kid has red hair. Also, at the end of the BFA cinematic, there's a troll with red hair blasting some lightning into the crowd, so I'm thinking that's him and he survives.

I am split about this video. While I think the message is kinda in reach, Saurfang being really depressed and tired of &quot;living the life of war&quot; on and on, I think how it´s presented is very heavy handed and the CGI video format is overstrained with the message it has to communicate.<br />
<br />
I like how it feels like that Saurfang needs his destiny (death) to hold on to the &quot;honor&quot; how he feels about &quot;honor&quot;, but is &quot;dragged&quot; / forced back into holding on to the burden of &quot;living with (without at this point) honor&quot; by the young troll lad. <br />
<br />
Saurfang might see that the horde he &quot;loves(d)&quot; needs him and therefore he has to force himself to drag through the mess, he has partially made possible himself. <br />
<br />
To bad that the way blizzard communicates the lore bits is so out of touch / heavy handed.<br />
<br />
Btw. this cinematic does not change my perception regarding how Sylvanas as a character has &quot;progressed&quot;. Still think it´s out of character and bizarre how she handled (writers made her handle) the whole thing. I would hate some kind of &quot;she was influenced by bla&quot; switch or something to redeem Sylvanas, that would hurt the character even more. From this point on she has to die the bitter death she is so afraid of, to suffer the consequnces that were shown to her after her suicide attempt at ICC.<br />
<br />
Sure thing, this video will heat up the discussions since Sylvanas Warbringer further I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand why you think that. I don't disagree that it's a strange time to release it. But when else would it be? It wouldn't have been sooner and they wouldn't have ever released this after next Tuesday. This was sort of the ideal week, before the scenario. It isn't like releasing this right now rather than tomorrow at 10 am would have had any different effect on a currently pissed off Horde player who needs placating. <br />
<br />
No, I think this was intended, the cinematic kinda fits to have been released at night. The calm before the storm(lol). Maybe they chose tonight because we will get more candy next Tuesday and they didn't need to give us everything at once. This is a breakup of every few days something else new and cool.<br />
<br />
P.S. Aside from the first couple days and a lot of pissed off people from the Sylvanas short(which isn't really pre patch content) that this has been a mess of a pre patch at all. I enjoyed the content personally. The only pre patch content I have heard complaints is that their should be more, but it has more than Legion did. 7.0 brought invasions(all of which were pretty much the same thing) and the broken short which is shorter than what we have now.<br />
<br />
Invasions were absolutely more repeatable for extra toys and things. Don't get me wrong it was a really fun few weeks of power leveling a couple toons but not really more content than 8.0.</div></div><hr />

That crossed my mind as well. He was young and his voice sounded fitting for his age. I just didn't like the accent and think it's lazy in comparison with the ingame troll voiceovers. I felt the same with one of the zandalari trolls when I was playing beta. It felt too american? Not sure. But it sounded worse than I was used to.</div></div><hr />

No way this cinematic took months. No way. It's no coincidence it was released when it was, whatever that reason may be.<br />
<br />
Again, I really don't see the point of this cinematic though. What exactly did it give us? He gets depressed, then goes back to being the exact same guy...<br />
<br />
I wasn't sold as to why he switched back fighting against the alliance at the end either. And why didn't he stop Sylvanas from burning the tree if it went against everything he stood and fought for? It did not fill in any blanks to the atrocious writing for the burning of teldrassil.<br />

<br />
First, I do not think Sylvanas will be a boos, or killed or turned out to be corrupted. Sylvanas has done shit like Teldrassil before (Gilnaes, South shore, Amberstill village). People saying her reaction at Teldrassil is out of character really need to look at her previous moves.<br />
Secondly, with the Horde complicit for the majority of the war of thorns, I do not think the Horde will openly rebel against Sylvanas for the simple reason they will be screwed regardless as the Alliance won't care that people are unhappy. Anduin may sue for peace with any rebels, but I can see the majority of the alliance leaders saying no and him having to back down. As such any &quot;raid&quot; on Sylvanas would just be horde based.<br />
In regards to Saurfang, I think he may leave the Horde and become neutral, possibly with a small community of former horde following him, but not all. As such I do not expect him to be watchief, although I would love him to be.<br />
Finally, everyone seems to think that the burning of Teldrassil will mean the Horde eventually loses this war. With Blizzard saying that story arcs go over multiple expansions now, they could have the Horde victorious and by the end of BfA the alliance is on the verge of collapse. Not saying it's a good plan, but it allows Sylvanas to remain warcheif and to not be a loot pinata</div></div><hr />

The troll has a terrible voiceover. The accent was bad, felt like Anduin trying too hard to sound like trolls.<br />
<br />
Me too, not to mention he is really small for a troll, Darkspears who are a bit smaller than Zandalari tower over orcs but They couldn't allow for Saurfang to be smaller than regular troll.<br />
<br />
Besides he appeared to be way too kind? Too much human-like. Hi voice also didn't fit much, trolls are monsters just like orcs they should have heavier voices :s<br />

That is fair, but they probably used an actual Jamaican actor, while the trolls in game have always been people mimicking Jamaican accents. Like how Vol'jin was, I believe, originally voiced by Metzen but they eventually cast a Jamaican man to voice him in later years. The way I read your initial post was the way the guy I said I was reminded of acted, saying &quot;that accent is shit&quot; when it was actually a genuine Scottish person, and I assume Blizz probably cast an actual Jamaican voice actor. I could be wrong, it could be just another person mimicking one, but I can't see why they wouldn't just find someone like they did for Vol'jin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When he told Sylvanas that all of the Alliance would come for them... How can he say something like this after his own mistake just few minutes/hours before that:<br />
<br />
<br />
He stood and brushed the dirt off his armor, shrugging away his aches and pains. Malfurion would recover, and when he returned to battle, he would make the Horde pay in blood. Saurfang was certain of it.<br />
Still, a great burden had been lifted from his soul. It felt right that Malfurion had survived. It felt honorable.<br />

<br />
I do wonder if an Alliance character also gets one of those. Genn perhaps? Considering he's also the number two of his faction leader and is also present at the siege.<br />
<br />
I also thought of Genn when thinking about alliance conterpart for this cinematic, but I think a video about Anduin would be more interesting and more of a counterweight to Saurfang, who both are about true identity of their factions.</div></div><hr />

But thanks for respecting mine, though I'm not exactly sure what that means because I know 1) you disagree with me, 2) you're willing to stick around to argue your point, and 3) you think I'm annoying, so I'm inclined to think that saying you respect my opinion is just some sort of culturally derived avoidance tactic that doesn't actually mean anything.<br />
<br />
Also I thought you were leaving?<br />
<br />
I was leaving until you replied. :) I hope you don't mind me answering back.<br />
<br />
I can't focus on positive things if a negative thing catches my mind first. You might argue the accent wasn't bad. You might be right, I might be wrong. But the fact is that I didn't like it. And that's something you should respect although you might disagree with me. I respect that you like it. It's no avoidance tactic, this is how disagreements should work. Two people have different opinions, we both can explain, we may or may not change our minds byť either way we should respect if someone thinks differently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides he appeared to be way too kind? Too much human-like. Hi voice also didn't fit much, trolls are monsters just like orcs they should have heavier voices :s<br />
<br />
Lol He said his father's name i Hekazi.<br />
<br />
<br />
Couldn't agree more. He felt too human-like to me as well. That was my main issue with this character.</div></div><hr />

Like how Vol'jin was, I believe, originally voiced by Metzen but they eventually cast a Jamaican man to voice him in later years. The way I read your initial post was the way the guy I said I was reminded of acted, saying &quot;that accent is shit&quot; when it was actually a genuine Scottish person, and I assume Blizz probably cast an actual Jamaican voice actor. I could be wrong, it could be just another person mimicking one, but I can't see why they wouldn't just find someone like they did for Vol'jin.<br />
<br />
I would be glad to be wrong. I can't really say if it's a real jamaican accent or not.</div></div><hr />

Again, i really don't see the point of this cinematic though. What exactly did it give us? He gets depressed, then goes back to being the exact same guy...<br />
<br />
I wasn't sold as to why he switched back fighting against the alliance at the end either. And why didn't he stop sylvanas from burning the tree if it went against everything he stood and fought for? It did not fill in any blanks to the atrocious writing for the burning of teldrassil.<br />

its animation, this VERY SIMPLE ANIMATION takes 13 hours of constant work for 30 seconds, so even then 6 minutes of animation that is atleast 2 weeks, but you think making this is as easy as making that?<br />

Pretty sure it's some form of damage control. I'd assume that this was supposed to be released the night befor BFA, seeing how it's literally the night befor the battle for Lordaeron. I'd assume they released it now because the reactions to Sylvanas bullshit were so... strong.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with Siege and doesn't really bring anything new to that table imo. We seem him fighting in the launch trailer. In this we see him get depressed then go back to the exact person he was before(of which I couldn't tell you why) and is ready to start fighting, ok.... <br />

Oh I'm totally with you, I was just pointing out an observation, since the close up of his face looked super familiar. I'd give them all the money to make a full length feature film using their cinematic engine rather than live action.

A silly gay troll was enough to convince Saurfang to turn back and run to &quot;live another day&quot;. I really liked the video and the direction it was going but in the end it ridiculed the horde even more and it made them look like total jokes. As an alliance player it makes me both happy and sad. Happy cause what's bad for horde is good for me, sad because nobody wants to beat an idiot opponent. I would much prefer a strong and powerful enemy so that my win against him actually means something.</div></div><hr />

A pity he is like &quot;let me die&quot; This story would need a big turn to let him see that life is worth something even if he lost so many. <br />
When I think about it he and Sylvanus have much in common, but she turned her hate against the living while he just went on and wanted to die. Oh my, philosophy! I'm out</div></div><hr />

I'm still convinced they made this partly or fully because of potential backlash. And that's like.....my opinion man.<br />

it very much does, it brings the attention that he allready was having his doubts before the blight attack, it brings to light that he did confront sylvans RIGHT AWAY and also that him and zappy boi are friends.<br />

<br />
But moving on.<br />
<br />
This is what us horde fans needed. One, it shows without the shadow of a doubt the fact sylvanas' evil represents, it isn't just the thousands of innocent night elves she killed, how it struck a blow to the alliance, its what such a move has done to the heart of the horde.<br />
<br />
Saurfang, much like cairne bloodhoof, is the heart of the horde. He's been through so many battles, he's fought and killed, but he's also redeemed and lead others in victory again greater evils. He's helped save the horde on so many occasions, and has been its most loyal warrior.<br />
<br />
Varok presents the horde that fought to secure its freedom and fight for a better tomorrow for all members of the horde, against the forces of silithis, against the scourge, against garrosh and his own kind to secure the hordes future. And this here is what broke him.<br />
<br />
You can't break someone like saurfang in the heat of battle, its only when everything he valued is destroyed by those he's meant to be defending could it break him. <br />
<br />
Saurfang represents me as a horde player for years, I'm tired of the horde alliance war, I didn't want to have another one, I don't want another villain leading the horde and further eroding the good aspects of the real horde, one that's about displaced races coming together and defending one another, about overcoming the odd, about showing despite some races claiming otherwise the horde isn't a group of monsters, despite having real monsters leading it.<br />
<br />
That's why horde fans needed this, to remind us when something like this happens, when a monster uses the horde as a weapon to commit unspeakable acts, that the real horde is there, and it's fed up and even tired of the same shit happening again and again.<br />
<br />
That's me as a horde fan.</div></div><hr />

It' s a bit too early to feel proud for the Horde again - at least,while that corpse is disgracing all of it' s heroic deeds in the past.<br />
<br />
I agree, it is to early to feel proud to be horde again right now. Because the horde is currently lead by a monster and we as fans have to put up with it a little longer.<br />
<br />
The alliance might get revenge by killing sylvanas and its well deserved, I just want the horde to feel like its old self again, like back when we fought for freedom in wc3 or against forces that threatened all life like the scourge</div></div><hr />

It makes horde look even worse. Now they're officially isis-level idiot honorless cowards. Not only do they kill civilians, they're also huge cowards. A silly gay troll was enough to convince Saurfang to turn back and run to &quot;live another day&quot;. I really liked the video and the direction it was going but in the end it ridiculed the horde even more and it made them look like total jokes. As an alliance player it makes me both happy and sad. Happy cause what's bad for horde is good for me, sad because nobody wants to beat an idiot opponent. I would much prefer a strong and powerful enemy so that my win against him actually means something.<br />
<br />
Why are people like you trying to desperately downplay the fact that Saurfang will do another battle for everyone that he deems worthy of fighting for? It's obvious he's not fighting for Sylvanas, but it's obvious that he's fighting for everyone else in the horde and troll made him realize that they do not deserve to all die in vain.</div></div><hr />

How long does it take to make a movie like Toy Story from start to finish?<br />
<br />
[Bruce] Pixar movies can take anywhere from 4 years to 7 years! The bulk of the production though, such as animation and lighting, only takes about 6 to 8 months.<br />

<br />
<br />
“Even with all of that computing might, it still takes 29 hours to render a single frame of Monsters University, according to supervising technical director Sanjay Bakshi.”<br />
<br />
At 24 frames per second and with a movie length of 1h44m we have 149,760 frames to render. This would take 4,343,040 hours, or 495.78 years, which is nonsensical, so I believe the 29 hours per frame number isn’t accurate for their supercomputers.<br />
<br />
If this meant 29 hours of CPU time, then with their 24,000 cores it would take 7.54 days.<br />
<br />
The article does go on to say:<br />
<br />
“All told, it has taken more than 100 million CPU hours to render the film in its final form. If you used one CPU to do the job, it would have taken about 10,000 years to finish. With all of those CPUs that Pixar did have, it took a couple of years to render.”<br />
<br />
If you have the CPU power, yes it does take a lot less time, but if you don't, it's a lot longer, afaik Blizzard renders their cinematics not via supercomputer but via in house servers that are quite a bit slower, but it's also a lot cheaper than renting out an entire cpu farm to do it for them.<br />
<br />
If you want to try and act smart, at least know the facts and conditions, so you don't look stupid.</div></div><hr />

CGI movies are so expensive per minute, especially that type of CGI, imagine having to redo scenes in a full CGI movie, you would have to rerender a portion of the frames before and after that scene and the scene itself, every single time.</div></div><hr />

I don't disagree that it's a strange time to release it. But when else would it be? It wouldn't have been sooner and they wouldn't have ever released this after next Tuesday. This was sort of the ideal week, before the scenario. It isn't like releasing this right now rather than tomorrow at 10 am would have had any different effect on a currently pissed off Horde player who needs placating. <br />
<br />
No, I think this was intended, the cinematic kinda fits to have been released at night. The calm before the storm(lol). Maybe they chose tonight because we will get more candy next Tuesday and they didn't need to give us everything at once. This is a breakup of every few days something else new and cool.<br />
<br />
P.S. Aside from the first couple days and a lot of pissed off people from the Sylvanas short(which isn't really pre patch content) that this has been a mess of a pre patch at all. I enjoyed the content personally. The only pre patch content I have heard complaints is that their should be more, but it has more than Legion did. 7.0 brought invasions(all of which were pretty much the same thing) and the broken short which is shorter than what we have now.<br />
<br />
Invasions were absolutely more repeatable for extra toys and things. Don't get me wrong it was a really fun few weeks of power leveling a couple toons but not really more content than 8.0.<br />
<br />
Tuesday with the next step in the chain since this ends the moment that event begins. The quest log fiasco yesterday was a big mess plenty of people had their logs wiped losing any progress on things like Balance of Power, which takes weeks to do. Ion came out and said in the Q&amp;A they fell short in week 1. So they had 1 week that wasn't a mess, not exactly ideal. A pre patch is a way to hammer out bugs for sure and sadly we get some now with the hopes we get none when the expansion launches. Another part of the pre patch is to ramp up excitement for the expansion and in many ways it feels like they are turning more people away than they are pulling in with this.</div></div><hr />

If you look at him around the one minute mark you can see he is covered in what looks like peach fuzz at least, not sure if they were going for just that or for the very short fur but he definitely has a layer of something over his skin. It made me smile when I noticed it.</div></div><hr />

It's not even just technical issues. There simply aren't enough people skilled enough available for that sort of project. The vast majority of animators skilled enough to work on a project of that magnitude are always being snatched by the likes of Disney Pixar and Dreamworks, studios which are never ever going to take on a movie project like Warcraft, unless you want it watered down into a fairy tail movie that is. Blizzard doesn't have the bargaining power to hire enough qualified people at once. Bear in mind I'm mostly just talking about animation here because that's my field. There are a bunch of other elements that makes a full CGI warcraft movie impossible to make at the moment, let alone five years ago..</div></div><hr />

Azshara warbringer is almost certainly planned for either Monday like Jaina or Tuesday like Sylvanas. They wouldn't want it to be totally overshadowed by this one. I doubt it was intended for a different time other than now, in between the two to take away from neither.</div></div><hr />

We seem him fighting in the launch trailer. In this we see him get depressed then go back to the exact person he was before(of which I couldn't tell you why) and is ready to start fighting, ok.... <br />
<br />
I'm still convinced they made this partly or fully because of potential backlash. And that's like.....my opinion man.<br />
<br />
I would love for you to, just once, experience how things are planned and coordinated in a high level professional field such as Blizzard development teams.<br />
This was likely planned years ago. Just like they are already making the first stepping stones for the next Xpac.<br />
And don't tell me you are because then you wouldn't be this ignorant and oblivious. <br />
<br />
My company is making business strategies 3-4 years in advance to get ahead our competitors and vice versa.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping this leads to a real shake up, like you can choose to join which ever faction you want at the end of the xpac. I don't want another deposed leader and thrall 2.0. Lets brake the mold, a third faction idk.</div></div><hr />
