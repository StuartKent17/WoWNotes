You can still do fully pepega raids of basically 1 armor type to trade. Which is what's currently being done.<br />

This is basicly the same as trading gear to somone who has enchanting so they can turn it into enchanting mats. It's not like some secret/hiden way to abuse the system behinds blizzards back, this is just being smart in how you spend your time as a hardcore raider.... and like somone else mentioned above, this is already being done with almost pure groups of spesific armor types.

<br />
Disenchanters are often given items a player doesn't need or want. This has been the case since Molten Core released. The only difference here is that the items being DE'd happen to provide an extra item.. it was an unintended consequence.<br />
<br />
You COULD make a case that the sheer volume of items being DE'd might be an exploit, but even still.. you have to put that against the fact that people DEing Azerite gear are all ready top geared and would be DEing it anyway.<br />
<br />
So, clever use.. Not exploit.</div></div><hr />

&quot;vulnerability in the software &quot;<br />

Trading items to another player to be DE'd is not finding a vulnerability in the software and taking advantage.....<br />

Exploit: a system isn't working as it should, usually due to technical oversight or exotic interactions.<br />
<br />
Clever use of game mechanics: a system is working as it should, but people are using it in ways that were not in the mind of the creators.<br />
<br />
Both can be fixed for various reasons, including balance. But just because something was fixed for balance doesn't make it an exploit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guilds are funneling the Azerite gear from raid into key players to DE/Scrap for residuum. <br />
This so those key players can get 2 bits of 415 Azerite week 1 of Mythic.<br />
<br />
The other is streamers in guilds like Method set up 30 man raids where everyone there trades the Azerite to the key raider to DE for residuum.<br />
<br />
It's still going to happen, just in more degenerate groups. i.e 90% Cloth / Leather / Mail / Plate groups.</div></div><hr />

That's a minor portion of the player base, so minor it doesn't even matter. They were already running &quot;single armor type splits&quot; since week one. Top of the top will always find ways to funnel, it's just more efficient.</div></div><hr />

For the single armor type groups, of course.<br />
<br />
The average player doesn't have access to something like that, however many guilds were funneling azerite into particular key players during mythic farm. <br />
There's no reason not to, so this fixes that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A good example of &quot;clever use of game mechanics.&quot;<br />
<br />
In MoP under the old conquest point system, my friend bought rings and sold them back every hour. As the cap went up and the weeks passed, he did this with more expensive equipment. His logic was that he could gain the benefits of using the conquest gear, without having to actually commit and spend the points, which he wanted to save for the weapon that could not yet be purchased.<br />
<br />
He was banned for 72 hours, despite not really exploiting.<br />
<br />
Its situations like that which make me hesitant to want anyone punished for anything other than exploiting known/blatant bugs. This feels similar to his case.</div></div><hr />

You neglected what I was replying to lol, the guy was asking for it to be increased another 100 to 1000 times so it negated the gains from before this fix.... which it's already going up a ton so these gains don't mean much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A specific is a whopping 7150 actually. I think these split raids were just to get people enough for two pieces of 1750 random the first week of mythic (thus making whatever drops tradeable too). <br />
<br />
IMO the costs are too expensive for targetteds (7150) even considering the new acquisition rates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or they should never added residuum from shredding items, just from weekly m+ chest and maybe few other sources (small amount from raid bosses? weekly pvp chest?) that are limited, but specific to a person, and then reduce the prices accordingly to account for less sources of residuum. <br />
<br />
It was meant to be a replacement for random azerite from m+ that you might have or might have not gotten in 8.0. It wasn't meant for method raiders shredding 100 raid loots, and it wasn't meant for joe shmoe who grinded azerites from invasions and warfronts to scrap. There's a reason why the only purchasable items are dungeon drops, not raid drops, pvp items or emissary loot table. It was meant for dungeon runners as an alternative of having to raid to obtain azerite.</div></div><hr />

this.<br />
there is enough azerite armor around outside of dungeons as is, so you don't need another &quot;i am forced to do this or i hinder my raid&quot; shit like this.<br />
and by the typical mindset of the average wannabe-elite, &quot;not hindering your raid&quot; means having 22k residuum by the time mythic raid opens.</div></div><hr />

other players pass on their pieces to another to get that player more residuum. it's still just one player who gets that scrap; not both.<br />
<br />
just like trading and DE'ing drops as mentioned before<br />
<br />
also worth mentioning: blizz' game, blizz' rules<br />
<br />
Huh? It's actually the opposite. Now Methodjosh only has to do one viewerrun instead of two.<br />
<br />
Also: The only effect of gear funneling is that raid tuning is massively harder. If top guilds already go into a raid with the item level that drops (which will happen to an extent due to residuum funneling), the raids have to be tuned in a way that most other guilds will have no chance to kill the bosses. Natural challenge by undergearing content is the reason why hard raids even exist. Blizzard will have to nerf the shit out of the next content very early this time.</div></div><hr />

oh my lord, you just made me spit my drink out with this comment, are you serious? legitimate question are you really this dense?<br />
<br />
this mechanic has been in the game since classic, fuck me with a rusty spork how do you not know this?, getting gear that 'doesn't belong to your class' has been around as long as the game has existed, only now are there systems in place to make it almost impossible to do so, i genuinely don't know if you're trolling or not because you have to have been living under a rock if you didn't know this.</div></div><hr />

My mind goes to someone finding out how to give someone gear their class can't actually wear.<br />
<br />
My friends (from my regular M+ group) give me all the gear they don't need to disenchant. Because they know I'm poor, so I can sell enchants and crystals. For example, my druid friend says scrapping leather gear only gives him some very cheap leather so he's really losing nothing by giving it to me.<br />
Sure, with Titan Residuum now they wouldn't trade me Azerite pieces, but thinking of trading them is as basic as breathing.<br />
<br />
I also have an outlier example of gear trading not for your spec - one of our guildies takes gear he can wear even if not his armor type if it has speed on it and nobody wants it. He has a speed set for old raids that he uses to farm and doesn't care about the actual stats on it.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
it's still just one player who gets that scrap; not both.<br />
<br />
Ok, look, this is Blizz trying to fix something they can't. And that is - make top guilds unable to benefit from what they consider 'unfair advantages'.<br />
<br />
It's not necessarily that they're unfair, it's just that developers design raids and systems, expecting them to be played in a certain way.<br />
<br />
For example:<br />
- you're supposed to beat a boss, get some gear drops, get a minor improvement for your raid, advance to next boss<br />
- do this for the reset until you can't kill bosses anymore<br />
- come next week, start all over - repeat as many times as required till your raid can beat the boss<br />
- accumulate titan residuum over a period of time and get upgrades slowly<br />
This is how your average guild does things.<br />
And then you have your top guilds who do things a bit differently. For example:<br />
- they make split runs so they funnel gear to their &quot;main&quot; players. The fact that the ones who give their gear don't get anything is a non issue; once theykill the boss, those who helped will get their kill (also, those who helped might be alts, so, again, non issue)<br />
- this way, having the best upgrades in the first week means you can kill the boss a whole lot faster than it was designed<br />
- top guilds need to do things fast - having to do the things they do requires a lot if investment on their part: time, money, everything; which means the boss really has to go down fast fast; a top guild doesn't want systems where you need to play long to grind (ex: legendaries, artifact power, azerite), because their purpose is not to play for long. They are also disadvantaged by RNG systems (again, legendaries and titanforges).<br />
<br />
So all in all, this isn't meant to ruin things for random guilds. It's meant to ruin things for top guilds. But those will find their ways anyway - until it's getting so cumbersome that they decide it's better to quit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You seem to think the dev's main goal is to make you pay. Hint : It's not. Their main goal is that we keep playing because we enjoy it, it's a game, no one forces you to play it for f***** sake<br />
<br />
Do you know that most devs are getting paid a fixed salary that doesn't depend on how much players spend on the game... do you know that there is a real world out there ?! <br />
<br />
Money is shareholders' goal and I don't think they give AF about azerite armor...<br />
<br />
Runing raids with only one armor class to funnel azerite to &quot;top raiders&quot; is not why this game should be played, how the hell do you fail to understand that ?!<br />
<br />
If their goal was only our playtime, why is everything so easy to get nowadays huh ?! And I bet you're complaining about how &quot;EZ evrrything is&quot;... Bluah... <br />
<br />
If everything suddenly became tedious, everyone and their mother would quit the game. A good way to earn money indeed. <br />
<br />
Please use your brain.<br />
<br />
Note : I'm actually playing LESS now than before and you know hat ? I'm still paying the same amount as 14 years ago. I can play 0h or 24h/24, Blizzard will get the exact same amount of money.... <br />

My point was that this should have been a &quot;thing&quot; since residuum was implemented, not one week, and after many guilds have already been trading the gear for many weeks now, before the new raid. Heck, I don't even know why they didn't just make it so you could only get residuum from items *you* looted, but I guess thats just too hard to code.</div></div><hr />

Guilds want world first ----&gt; You get that by gearing faster then the other guy ----&gt; Game currently offers the next Seasons currency.

They found a vulnerability in the software and took advantage of it. AKA they exploited the vuln for personal gain.<br />
<br />
Do you say the same of companies that get hacked, that the hackers cleverly used software mechanics?<br />
<br />
What?<br />
<br />
There was no reason to assume that this was unintended behavior before this change. Scrapping 8.1 azerite pieces is meant to give residuum; there was no mention (before now) that you shouldn't have been able to scrap gear you can't use. As shown in the picture above you, this also does nothing to stop armor-type stacking raids for the same effect. <br />
<br />
Exploiting a vulnerability means taking advantage of a clearly unintended behavior. Up until now, this was behaving as expected by every definition of the word.<br />
<br />
I think it's dumb that the game allows people to do this, but until such a time that they can't, it certainly is not in any way exploiting. Funneling gear to specific people has been a staple of high end raiding for as long as the game has existed; this is how it exists in the current game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
something blizzard has been trying to dampen recently is the prevalence of split raiding as a means of gearing up single characters. for instance, if a guild has a 5 alt requirement like method does, using those alts to pass titan residuum to a single player is pretty fuckin stupid.<br />
<br />
imagine a raid of 20 people going into mythic, 19 players are alts 1 player is a main. every single piece of azerite gear goes to the main to get scrapped.<br />
<br />
this is hearsay, but people have been talking about some players currently having 4000+ titan residuum. might be an exaggeration, or might be via the method mentioned above.</div></div><hr />

Those ppl cometing for wf wait for months to prepare and compete for the race when new content comes out.Wtf is your problem or anyone's problem with that? Why it bothers you or anyone not competing that they can buy some new azerite pieces first day? MOst fuckin ppl run arround the map doing just world quests , play like shit but complain all the time about what those top guilds are doing or not.why is blizzard bothered about people doing split runs? they do it cuz they want to, they pay the game subscription and they can prepare as they wish. Even if they could not funnel azerite pieces to mains they would still do some split runs , but not so many. Anyway judging their incompetence they only made the problem worse, by forcing guilds now to do leather/cloth/plate/mail runs.The problem is blizzard not the players.

<br />
IMO the costs are too expensive for targetteds (7150) even considering the new acquisition rates.<br />
<br />
Yeah, being quite honest it seems like a better bang for your buck to get a random piece, at least early in the tier. With the two rings you have a high chance of getting at least one highly desirable trait, or two pretty decent ones, which combined with the high mainstat of a Mythic piece would make it a clear, instant upgrade during progression where you need them most. Later in the tier you can use the accumulated Residuum to target a BiS if its traits still elude you. <br />
<br />
Which I assume is how Blizzard designed the system from the get go and why specific pieces are so darn expensive.</div></div><hr />

It’s unfair to punish players for doing something that isn’t intended when it isn’t clear that the behavior isn’t intended.<br />
Funneling gear has always been an option and there was no reason (prior to this change) to assume that it wasn’t intended for residuum.<br />
And it’s not like this gave anyone a huge advantage for no effort as you are still spending the time to acquire the gear and only getting small gains.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In MoP under the old conquest point system, my friend bought rings and sold them back every hour. As the cap went up and the weeks passed, he did this with more expensive equipment. His logic was that he could gain the benefits of using the conquest gear, without having to actually commit and spend the points, which he wanted to save for the weapon that could not yet be purchased.<br />
<br />
He was banned for 72 hours, despite not really exploiting.<br />
<br />
Its situations like that which make me hesitant to want anyone punished for anything other than exploiting known/blatant bugs. This feels similar to his case.<br />
<br />
This is clearly exploiting lol...</div></div><hr />

Nobody should get in trouble, right. <br />
<br />
But this isn't why they are making the change. They are making this change to prevent the 1% of players from playing for excessive amounts of time, simply to just put themselves in the best position possible leading into the raid. <br />
<br />
Much like they killed split runs with ML removal. They don't want the top players to funnel their time and resources into playing so much just to have the edge leading into the next raid. It defeats the purpose of the entire system to treat the guild/raid like a spread sheet for efficiency. The team doesn't like making people feel like they have to do something, so they remove these methods to try realistically even the race, so that 1% raiders aren't spending 90hr a week doing split runs and azerite funneling.<br />

This is clearly exploiting lol...<br />
<br />
Right? Like, he is clearly going around the intended purpose of the sell back system. It's not intended to be a gear rental, it's intended to be an accidental purchase return. <br />
<br />
IDK how people defend this. His reasoning is as bad as Season 2 win traders that literally queued against like MMR's and did no damage and no healing so that they could bump people into higher brackets, and then would leave the team and trade wins the other way to inflate MMR.</div></div><hr />

It’s exploitative behaviour by groups and players.<br />
<br />
Holy heck, you don’t get World 1st the day of raid opening and need a couple weeks to appropriately gear to beat the content...geez, while we’re at it, remove open PTR testing of mythic difficulty bosses. Let these elite players prove how good they are when it’s released to the general population, and not “tested” for them to pre make strats.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delekii</div><div class="date">2019-01-18, 08:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is everyone here getting all upset over this? What was being done to funnel azerite to 1 person to scrap/DE in order to get more residuum than a person that only gets azerite gear for themselves and that's it is clearly against the spirit of the system, which was &quot;if you don't want an azerite gear that -you- got, you can still DE/scrap it to put towards an azerite gear that you DO want&quot;, but people twisted this into whatever extreme end guilds are doing right now with 30 man single armor class raids funneling every single azerite piece to 1 person. It's clearly an abuse of the system put in place. If you don't see that, then you are part of the problem.<br />
<br />
It's simply not the case.<br />
<br />
You can ascribe that meaning to it after the fact, but before the fact this is a system that has never been mirrored in the past. The closest analogue is tier tokens, which could be funneled very easily to whomever you wanted to funnel them too. It was essentially the norm that important set bonuses were gathered first. In the same fashion, funneling azerite gear to a specific person with a specific trait in mind is essentially the same, and it was enabled completely by the gear being tradable.<br />
<br />
Now that it has been changed, it's clear that it's not in the spirit of the system, but before the change there was no reason historically to think that. The system allowed the behavior, which was not at all uncommon in its analogue in every raid in the past.<br />
<br />
I am not an elitist player, I am barely a raider. I finished heroic uldir like 2 months after its release and barely raided before that. In the distant past I did some casual mythic raiding back in the days of ulduar. There is no doubt in my mind that it is a perfectly valid assumption that it is legitimate to give people tradable gear to break down into residuum when the system is released in a state that allows it. Allowing guilds to aggregate resources for targeted upgrades has been a thing for a very long time, until very recently.</div></div><hr />
