The Gnome Heritage Armor quest chain is now available for testing on the PTR. It requires you to have a level 120 gnome that is exalted with Gnomeregan to start the chain.<br />
<br />
<br />
The quest &quot;Shifting Gears&quot; can be picked up from Ace Pilot Stormcog by the Stormwind Embassy. He says that the Alliance has made a new request for Gnomeregan's might in the war and asks you to meet Captain Sparknozzle in New Tinkertown, the starting area for the gnomes.<br />
There you find out that the Alliance is willing to fund a new aerial task force, the Gnomish Elite Aerial Rangers (G.E.A.R), and you are to be the lead of the test team. You then introduce yourself to your team, Fizzie Tinkerbow, Cog Captain Winklespring, and Emaedi Autoblast.<br />
You are then tasked with retrieving the Prototype Arcane Engine within Gnomeregan's Engineering Labs. What follows is a trek through the halls of Gnomeregan, avoiding broken robot explosions and faulty gas pipes. You also are attacked by giant spiders and leper rats along the way.<br />
When you make it to the prototype engine, you find that it is being guarded by a mechanical dog named Lass-E x12. After destroying the dog and claiming the engine, a security alarm goes off and you escape back outside via a teleporter nearby.<br />
When you give the engine to Captain Sparknozzle, he states that he sent the team to investigate a distress call from Fizzlecrank Airstrip in Borean Tundra. There you find out that troggs have attacked and must take care of them with a prototype bomber gun attached to your back. The gun will either fire a missile or an exploding mechanical chicken when you use the extra action button.<br />
After killing 10 troggs, you find out that an intelligent trogg named Krugg the Smart stole a Defendo-bot and you are tasked with using the bomber gun on him as well, finding a broken communication device on his corpse.<br />
You present the device to Fizzi and help her get her machine working by flicking a lever. The device shows a hologram of Telzo Sparkspanner, an assistant to the deceased Thermaplugg. He is behind the trogg attacks! The signal is coming from Storm Peaks, so you and your team take to the skies in your airships to track him down, finding out that Telzo wants revenge on all followers of Mekkatorque for the events of Gnomeregan.<br />
When you arrive at the Storm Peaks, the tracker goes haywire and you are forced to land, using a cloaking device to stay hidden from the Ironbound troggs that are invading the area. You then take control of a spider tank with a rail gun and flamethrower to dispatch some troggs while the tracker is fixed. You eject from the tank and use a helicopter jet pack to reach your airships, and find out that Telzo is inside the Halls of Stone. You then command an airship to shoot the armies of troggs below before being struck and sent crash landing into the Halls of Stone.<br />
Your crew and you then take on Telzo, who is inside his mech the Smasher x900, which launches electric goop at you, send balls of electricity flying in your direction, and puts up a shield that blocks all frontal attacks. When it is defeated, Telzo ejects saying that the titan defenses are under his control, but he is killed during his speech.<br />
You then return to New Tinkertown and receive the Heritage of Gnomeregan (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/296926-heritage-of-gnomeregan) along with the G.E.A.R. Tracking Beacon (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168862-g-e-a-r-tracking-beacon), which functions the same as the Flight Master's Whistle (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/141605-flight-masters-whistle) but summons your G.E.A.R airship instead.<br />

<br />
Yes, they actually are on top of your eyes, making you look sad by default. I was hoping this was an issue with the model viewer online, but no.. it definitely looks terrible. The entire armor color palette is terrible too.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, I still consider it as lost opportunity to combine (https://d.wattpad.com/story_parts/206747378/images/142837a6a9fc7a7b.jpg) a protective face scarf (https://ageofsteam.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/outfit6.jpg)/bandana (https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LFmbEStj_SU/maxresdefault.jpg) together with these glasses (since in resulting version, it happened just something like useless, visual, not even lowered down, very ordinary accessory, what is there looks too expressionless; which also will give another opportunity to hide &quot;difference&quot; in geometry and idiotic facial animations of new models *wicked laugh*), especially considering that this style for WoW mostly speaks less about “mechanic” experience, but about “driving” abilities/nature gift. As for armor itself, it's also very unoriginal and very similar to mail (https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/272238-bloodthirsty-gladiators-chain-armor.jpg)/plate (https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/307833-bloodthirsty-gladiators-plate-armor.jpg) elements of PvP/PvE sets from previous expansions (I could even find which of them specifically, but I think this is unnecessary, since you see it yourself) ...but maybe they decided to save more ornate (https://ath.unileverservices.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/10/steampunk-pilot-handlebar.jpg) concepts for something (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/2a/Steampunk_Outfit_Lord.jpg) &quot;to come (https://magicfabricblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Steampunk_Zbrush.jpg)&quot;?<br />

I disagree. Legion was about classesWhere did you get that? I believe (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2478105-8-2-content-pointless-with-current-class-design?p=51095152#post51095152) you were looking for word &quot;specs&quot; with supplementing it by word &quot;pruning (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/is-wow-just-an-esport-now/159508/20)&quot;, then everything will come to sense :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

1. Garrison hs 2. Dalaran hs and what else? you can use any toy instead of regular hearthstone, set inn as your hs, throw away conjured item, use a toy (innkeeper daughter, diablo portal, winterveil gift, ethereal portal, etc - just type hearthstone in toy pane) + you can throw away regular flightwhistle when gnomeregan one is acquired, if you like nearest flight master mount appearance you can always ask in dalaran for another flightwhistle</div></div><hr />

I disagree. Legion was about classes, this expansion is about races.<br />
Also I freaking love to make a theme for the race I play. I had carneval enough when playing classic (did you ever dress up in green, ugly leather for princess huhuran? If not you have no idea xD)<br />
Other than that: no one is taking away being dressed as some unique hero.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is when classes are meaningful and important, but races are pretty much cosmetic (if you disregard the minor effects racial abilities give).<br />
Oh and BTW remove racials. The &quot;race fantasy&quot; bullshit lost any meaning when you introduced gnome hunters and nelfs mages. You're shooting yourself in the foot, when you're making content for a race people can't switch to, because their retarded racial gives them 1% more dps and they're in a endgame raiding guild.</div></div><hr />

You can easily mix and match the pieces. I unlocked the belf heritage armor but only use a couple pieces on my belves. They can compliment mogs really well.<br />

Why the hell do gnomes get a special flight whistle in addition to their heritage armor? Blood elves and dwarves just got the armor. Why do gnomes get more?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would guess it because fewer people make Gnomes than other races? They are trying to encourage more gnomes in game maybe. I really like the armour but I have never yet coped with playing a gnome, this may actually make me try again though. A pink haired female hunter just for fun :)</div></div><hr />

You're shooting yourself in the foot, when you're making content for a race people can't switch to, because their retarded racial gives them 1% more dps and they're in a endgame raiding guild.<br />
<br />
Yes races are cosmetic and a little bit crap mainstream lore. So... This is a cosmetic addition to the game. Those who like heritage and their gnomes will like it. Those who don't, won't. Where is the problem?</div></div><hr />

Havent you realise?<br />
Blizzard is only willing to devote X amount of effort into an xpack at a time, the next expansion will be amazing, the one after that will be shit.<br />
watch it happen</div></div><hr />

Very fitting for a gnome. I'd give an 8/10 for the armor, with maybe the biggest improvement locations being helmet options instead of goggles and some more engineerish looking shoulders.<br />
<br />
Its hard to see it on the still pictures but the gears on the shoulder pads are in motion so they look a lot better in reality than in still pics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's exactly the type of thing i was thinking of. (i didn't notice it from the pics so tyvm!).<br />
<br />
Some helm variation would be nice too but all in all, these are one of the best heritage sets out there. very fitting. Makes me wanna have a gnome for the first time</div></div><hr />

The moving cog pieces with the metal apron and bolts fastened in on gloves and other moving parts gives it a look that a tinker/engineer/metal worker would utilize. Fits with Gnome themes pretty well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wouldn’t be a proper gnome armor set if it didn’t clip awfully.<br />
<br />
This pic from the OP kind of describes my reaction.<br />

Why heritage armor even exists? The whole point of transmog is to make yourself look unique, not like all the other &lt;your_race_here&gt;s. It's another bit of non-content like Allied Races. It's not bad, if it's a very minor thing added in a huge content patch, but WoW has many core problems now and I can imagine it's discouraging seeing that the manpower/worhours are being spent on... this.<br />
<br />
Not really. That’s what it might mean to some people but the correct answer is that the point of transmog is to make yourself look however you want to look. I never cared if someone else had the same transmog as me, the only thing that mattered was whether I liked it. Every transmog option is just that; an option. I don’t particularly care for this one, but I’m sure there are plenty of people who like these race thematic sets.</div></div><hr />

I don't really think the idea of Gnome hunters to be so weird, i just assume that most of them are:<br />
<br />
A) Lone Hunters -no pets, with guns, and we see many Gnomes NPC like this that even use Mail armor<br />
<br />
B) Use Mechanical pets -In the end, they are one of the races that start with the ability to tame mechanical creatures</div></div><hr />
