Paragon 25-Man Lich King Normal Mode World First Kill<br />
Paragon (http://www.paragon-wow.com/) killed the Lich King a couple of minutes ago and we will assume that this kill is bug-free and will make everyone happy. Fun fact: they killed him on the first try. Congratulations to them.<br />

PvP Healing Change Update<br />
After further observations of the recent changes made to resilience and healing in PvP, we have made an additional change via an in-game fix so that the PvP healing debuff in Arenas, Battlegrounds, and Wintergrasp now also lowers the effectiveness of Power Word: Shield and Sacred Shield by 10%. The majority of other strong shields or damage absorption mechanics are already affected by the healing change, so we feel this new adjustment is an appropriate step in balancing the effects of resilience versus healing. The ultimate goal is to find a better median between PvP encounters feeling too quick from burst damage, or too long from heals, shields, and absorption effects. We will continue to monitor the way these changes play out and let you know if we feel any further changes are needed. As always, feedback based on your PvP experience with these new changes is welcome. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
Nibelung hotfix (Nibelung (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49992/nibelung/))<br />
We are currently in the process of applying two hotfix improvements to the Nibelung staff. The first change is that we are improving the chance for a val’kyr to proc from 1% to 2%. While this may not seem like a significant improvement, it will be notable and result in the val'kyr appearing more often.<br />
<br />
The second change is that anytime a summoned val’kyr casts her smite spell, she will heal herself for 25% of the damage done. This will help keep them alive when AoE damage is happening but not make them invincible as we still want them to feel like a summoned creature and not a special form of a DoT spell that has awesome art.<br />
<br />
We understand the frustrations players have had with this weapon so far. We currently plan to make more proc weapons in the future and are committed to making this and other proc weapons fun and competitive items.

<br />
PvP healing changes<br />
As was stated in the post announcing the change to healing, we'll be carefully watching the effects the change has when coupled with the recent buff to resilience. Your feedback is always welcomed and will hold infinitely more water -- when you've proven through a carefully demonstrated critique of the healing and resilience changes -- that you've been through a great many PvP scenarios post-patch 3.3.2. <br />
<br />
[...] In summary -- because I feel another paragraph is what you want -- we feel the healing change was necessary given the current state of PvP. We made a resilience change to reduce the feel of burst &quot;GCD&quot; fights in PvP, but we knew such a change could easily favor healers too much. These two changes do not cancel each other out; and we expect to see more fights where health pools matter more, where it's no longer a blur of DPS classes taking opponents from 100%-0% in seconds, or healers easily keeping health pools at, or close to 100% for prolonged periods. Certain classes or class combinations could prove to be too powerful as a result, and as we've said all along, we'll be watching and ready to react.

<br />
Tanking class disparities in raid<br />
Also remember that players pick their class for a lot of reasons and guilds pick their tank for a lot of reasons. We know that if we buff or nerf too much that we can drive population, but we also know there are plenty of other factors at play. For example, I'm not sure how powerful a tank class would have to be at tanking before you'd see its population jump if it was really frustrating or boring to play or really hard to gear or required a ton of skill to do well or if it was terrible at every other aspect of the game. (I don't think we have any of those classes in the game at the moment -- I'm just pointing out an extreme, contrived case that could affect population.)<br />
<br />
The biggest red flag for us will be if raids feel like they have to gravitate towards a certain tank class for the hard fights. (If you swap tanks for a couple of fights, that's not a big deal either, assuming the swap doesn't become too widespread, or you're blocked if you fail to swap.) It's a big deal if a particular tank class just can't cut it, or has to work much harder (or get much luckier) on the same content, assuming the content is challenging. I can't imagine too many guilds replacing their main tank for a different class because they are stalled at current Icecrown progression. Not many of the Icecrown fights really tax the tank, except for perhaps Festergut. That's about to change with LK and the hard modes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/22748799633-putricide---bql-top-100-kills-tanks-by-spec.html))<br />
<br />
PvP healing changes and drain spells<br />
Drain Life isn't affected. Nor is Fel Armor, Death Coil, Haunt, Devouring Plague or Spirit Bond.<br />
<br />
It's a little technical, but things that are actual drains are not affected. Heals that get proc'd by other effects are affected.<br />
<br />
Currently the nerf is only 10%, so I don't expect the impact on a lot of these lower healing effects to be a big deal. <br />
<br />
[...] Vampiric Embrace will be affected by the nerf.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there isn't going to be a hard and fast rule that determines what is affected and what is not. It just depends technically on how the spells are created. The tooltip often suggests what is happening behind the scenes, but isn't 100% reliable.<br />
<br />
Remember, the magnitude is currently small. We can't imagine too many PvP encounters that are resolved differently based on 10% less healing from VE.<br />
<br />
This was a blanket solution, and the problem with blanket solutions is that you have very little room to handle special cases. In this case, we didn't want to wait for the elegant solution that affected say just the true priest, paladin and druid healing spells, because that would have delayed the change possibly until Cataclysm (where I suspect it won't even be needed). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22749002147-the-healing-debuff-double-dips-warlocks.html))<br />
<br />
[...] It's a little technical which abilities get hit and which do not. If your ability procs a heal on you, then that is affected (such as VE). If you are doing a straight out drain, like Death Coil, then it will not be affected.<br />
<br />
It's just 10% (for now) so I don't think the effect on a lot of these secondary heals will be very noticeable to be honest. Really we were trying to hit the big healer-based heals like Penance, Flash / Holy Light, Lifebloom, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/22749572195-when-is-10-not-10.html))<br />

Scourge Strike Bug<br />
To be clear, while Scourge Strike should not have the physical and Shadow portions both hit by resilience, they should not independently be buffed by +damage effects either. The Shadow damage should in most cases just be a function of the physical damage done. Exceptions are things like Ebon Plague that specifically boost magic damage and don't buff physical damage. Ebon Plague should buff the Shadow damage portion of Scourge Strike. So it's possible the resilience is bugged (in which case it's about to get worse with the resilience change), but at first glance we think Outbreak and the tier 10 bonus are working correctly.<br />
<br />
This ability has gone through numerous iterations in an attempt to get it both balanced and fun, so some confusion about how it is supposed to work is certainly understandable. <br />
<br />
[...] I'm not sure where the interpretation came from that we're going to nerf Scourge Strike for PvE. All I was trying to say was that the current 3.3 version of Scourge Strike seems to be working correctly for PvE but might be penalized too much by resilience in PvP. If that turns out to be the case, then you would see your Scourge Strike damage go up in PvP (assuming the target has some kind of resilience) and stay the same in PvE.<br />
<br />
I know we have changed this talent a lot, and I do apologize for any confusion. If you recall, not long ago Scourge Strike could crit independently. When we changed that, we removed some of its ability to double dip. A +damage ability should already affect the physical portion of the strike, so indirectly affects the Shadow portion of the strike. Abilities, most saliently Ebon Plague, that do not affect the physical damage can still boost Scourge Strike through the Shadow portion. Resilience, on the other hand, already reduces the physical damage done so indirectly affects the Shadow portion done. It should not further reduce the Shadow portion separately. We took steps to make sure that wasn't happening, so it it is indeed happening, something broke along the way. My apologies if that is the case. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22748799917-scourge-strike-is-bugged-fix-this-for-s8.html))<br />
<br />
Scourge Strike Hotfix<br />
After further testing, it does appear that resilience additionally lowers the Shadow damage done by Scourge Strike. It was definitely working at one time, so something broke along the way. We apologize for the bug and will be hotfixing it.<br />
<br />
All of the other modifiers to Scourge Strike that we tested appear to be working as intended. The net result should be no change to PvE damage and a buff to PvP damage (against targets with resilience).<br />
<br />
Again, we know it's a confusing ability and perhaps confusing enough for us to eventually change. Again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22748799917-scourge-strike-is-bugged-fix-this-for-s8.html))<br />

Warlock changes in 3.3.2<br />
Affliction was doing good damage before and with the buff should now be competitive with any class in the game, depending on the fight involved (and how much the mages benefit from IA). That doesn't mean *you* are going to top meters. Big difference. :) The management of Corruption rolling with NMIC isn't ideal gameplay. We generally like the kind of gameplay that lets skilled players eek out a little bit more damage, but we agree the Corruption behavior is a little extreme. That said, it's not as bad as the haste effects on rolling, and ultimately we know how to fix it with a little tech. (Which doesn't mean we can fix it immediately, unfortunately.)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure we have enough data on Demo yet. The buffs definitely did something. Totally agree on the mana issues. That's something we want to address (standard no ponies promises applies).<br />
<br />
We knew the buffs to Destro wouldn't be enough, but we still thought they were worth making (compared to doing nothing at all). To finish the job will require more extensive talent changes. (Don't interpret that as a complete redo of the tree though.) We think we can do some of this before Cataclysm ships, but it's not the kind of thing we felt safe doing with the kind of limited testing / non-PTR status of patch 3.3.2. We could have just thrown caution to the wind and made the Empowered Imp or Conflag changes gratuitously overpowered, but that carries risks of A) forcing all of the Affliction locks to respec, or B) breaking PvP.<br />
<br />
It's tricky with the pure classes because a lot of players will flock to the spec with the highest dps, even if the margin is only 1% (not saying that's the case here, mind you). The risk then for us is that we force players to constantly change specs every time we make adjustments because someone else is now top dog. We screwed up and did this with hunters and mages in earlier patches and nearly did it with rogues in 3.3. Rogues aren't in a bad place now, where some players just prefer Combat over Mutilate and actually hunters aren't far from that either with MM vs. SV (yes, both of those classes have a third tree, but having two raid viable specs is still better than one or none). In any case, we still want to get Destro's dps higher.<br />
<br />
We really don't expect the healing nerfs that affect warlock self-healing to have a huge impact on PvP one way or the other. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22749002512-warlock-buff-332.html))<br />

Devastate Buff Hotfix<br />
Yes, we are hotfixing Devastate to do 20% more damage, not just 20% more weapon damage.<br />
<br />
I can't comment on when the hotfix will go live, because there are a lot of people involved in getting those changes pushed out, so we just don't know. Often hotfixes go live within a day or two, but some may take longer if we find a bug or unexpected side-effect to the initial change.

Man blizzard is clueless.<br />
<br />
So Stoneclaw Totem is neglected.<br />
Before Hotfixing something, Why dont you look into It.<br />
<br />
And these changes do Offset Each other AS A HEALER. Sure I take less dmg, but I heal less. Therefore ppl still get globaled.<br />
<br />
take 10% less damage, receive 10% less healing. Sounds like a Pretty fair Way to Achieve the goal of Less Bursting.<br />
<br />
How did u Counter Burst Before? With clutch heals and alot of them.<br />

So Stoneclaw Totem is neglected.<br />
Before Hotfixing something, Why dont you look into It.<br />
<br />
And these changes do Offset Each other AS A HEALER. Sure I take less dmg, but I heal less. Therefore ppl still get globaled.<br />
<br />
take 10% less damage, receive 10% less healing. Sounds like a Pretty fair Way to Achieve the goal of Less Bursting.<br />
<br />
How did u Counter Burst Before? With clutch heals and alot of them.<br />

<br />
Stop reporting on kills. It's just another NPC and World Firsts no longer prove skill as there are multitudes of other guilds within the same week that beat an encounter...they just choose to raid different days. You clearly had plenty of other news to post so it wasn't a slow post day. Stop posting flamebait Boub (i.e. these pointless posts about killing a boss minutes/hours before another guild does); I would think you would want to set an example for those that sign up here.<br />
<br />
Also don't forget what you said in the Paragon post &quot;go back to WoW news!&quot; SO DO IT. Don't ever stray back to drama bait by pointing out a stupid boss kill. Video streams are cool, but a stupid screenshot of someone beating a boss that thousands more during the same week kill (and all only because they started their raid at a different time) is NOT WOW NEWS.</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering what spec Diivil was in for the kill.<br />

I was wondering the same thing. Their guilds website has them both listed as Demo tho... which is just nutz considering now gimped demo is....</div></div><hr />

<br />
People should keep in mind though, they had 2 days to run many 10s groups and get lots of experience on the fight before attempting it in 25. They also likely had a very geared alt/leftover main raid take attempts at him in a different raid ID before trying it with their strongest core.<br />
<br />
So '1 shot' isn't really a 1 shot, but it is still impressive that they were able to do it.</div></div><hr />

probably he can drop 2 of the same weapons or probably armory bugs ( that;s what happens when you equip it then give it to somebody else ).You sure it's not just one 10 man and one 25 man?didn't bother looking really :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Grats to paragon, true skill has been shown today and no guild deserves it more! I am saddened by Ensidia's predicament and they sealed their own fate. It is a shame to see such a successful guild be hit so hard by just finding loop holes and ways to approach counters that the blizzard devs did not fully test. <br />
<br />
On another note, I did some armory/WoW-Heroes checking on diivil and found that they must be demo, I am absolutely amazed that a demo lock did so much dps but on a fight like there where the last 35% is like 8 million hp, that sure is a hella lot of soul fires...:D<br />
<br />
Grats again guys!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on armory im inclined to say Diivil as Demo and Jubeto as affliction.<br />
Altho both could just as easily switched specs after the kill tho.<br />
<br />
Both are running affliction/meta builds tho, so no destro atleast.<br />
Which is kinda surprising to me actually.</div></div><hr />

I believe it was said somewhere that they had done the 10 man on their alts a bunch of times (more than one run) and gotten the hang of it, and perhaps did it on 25 on their alts as well until they had the fight down 100% then went in there with their mains and &quot;one shot&quot; it. Is it a one shot? In theory yes, but in practicality? no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The freezing conditions of arctic Finland have prepared them well to fight any sort of evil super villain that does significant amounts of frost damage.<br />
<br />
That, and they probably had some attempts with a 25-man alt group before, they also downed 10man earlier and well, they are truly awesome players easily comparable to Ensidia or STARS or whatever.<br />

The majority of other strong shields or damage absorption mechanics are already affected by the healing change, so we feel this new adjustment is an appropriate step in balancing the effects of resilience versus healing. The ultimate goal is to find a better median between PvP encounters feeling too quick from burst damage, or too long from heals, shields, and absorption effects.

Man blizzard is clueless.<br />
<br />
So Stoneclaw Totem is neglected.<br />
Before Hotfixing something, Why dont you look into It.<br />
<br />
And these changes do Offset Each other AS A HEALER. Sure I take less dmg, but I heal less. Therefore ppl still get globaled.<br />
<br />
take 10% less damage, receive 10% less healing. Sounds like a Pretty fair Way to Achieve the goal of Less Bursting.<br />
<br />
How did u Counter Burst Before? With clutch heals and alot of them.<br />

World first should count from when your server get's up 'til you down the boss(es).

&quot;And down he went.<br />
We started with our alt raid first to scout the tactics, as he proved to be fairly challenging for a normal mode encounter. After we had the tactics pinned down, we logged our main characters, and went on to one-shot the boss in that raid. &quot;<br />
<br />

I'm not an English major but I believe that means they attempted the encounter several times. One shot =/ attempts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I'm fully aware of their statement and how many alt raids they ran with it to learn the fight. <br />
<br />
It seems though, that we are essentially arguing semantics then. If we acknowledge that it is the total number of attempts taken on a boss, spread across 10 and 25 raid lockouts over multiple formed raids that determine how many 'shots' a boss was downed in, could we then not make just as valid an argument that a guild who downs a boss in X attempts, and a guild who downs a boss in X-10 attempts that the second guild therefore did it first?*<br />
<br />
<br />
*please note I'm not calling out the validity of any specific guild's 'first' kills, simply raising a point.</div></div><hr />

This. People want to pick apart the world firsts until they have so many qualifiers attached to each that they can no longer compare them.<br />

Well it do sort of invalidate the 20 attempts limitation. Blizzard could as well just remove that limitation or make an account limitation instead of character limitation somehow.<br />
<br />
But making a clean raid and a one-shot Lich King kill is still a feat and shouldn't be called fail. That just oozes of jealousy. I'm sure everyone else have done the same and while they have not downed the Lich King yet, Paragon has.<br />

<br />
And these changes do Offset Each other AS A HEALER. Sure I take less dmg, but I heal less. Therefore ppl still get globaled.<br />
<br />
take 10% less damage, receive 10% less healing. Sounds like a Pretty fair Way to Achieve the goal of Less Bursting.<br />
<br />
How did u Counter Burst Before? With clutch heals and alot of them.<br />
<br />
CLUELESS, CLUELESSSSSSS EVERYONE WHO DESIGNED THIS GAME HAS NEVER GOTTEN GLADIATOR IN ARENA HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON IN PVP.<br />
<br />
FUCKIN ALL PVE CAREBARE NEWBS.<br />

<br />
People seem too love hating top players, same in every sport/game, but lets see the fact :<br />
<br />
Paragons wf anub hc - They EXPLOITED the game, they KNEW what they where doing by soulstoning the raid with low level alts being logged out, outside ToC, Ensidia however used something that is in alot of peoples normal rotations, has been a used item in pve and pvp since vanilla, BOMBS and they get banned for using something that is in the game that increases their dps ? <br />
<br />
And what about holy wrath bug ? Why didnt they get banned for that? <br />
<br />
And then Exodus who also EXPLOITED with knowledge, where actually suspended for 72 hours, however Ensidia still didnt know what was causing the bug, why would they stop using items in the raid ? It could've been like that dagger from Onyxia which removed millions of HP on bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No, lay down your pathethic &quot;Ensidia got what they deserved&quot; and look on fact instead.<br />
<br />
IF this kill is legit, great job Paragon, but you know it's not world first , and if you are gonna say &quot;Blablabla they got suspended and their achies removed&quot; well, good for you, and then it's perhaps time too grow some balls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People saying world first (including Boub) -- is there a reason this gets 'world first' billing when Blood Legion 10m did not? Yes the patch landed on US a day earlier, but EU guilds had the benefit of watching the streams and picking up bits and pieces of strategy from those who were doing it cold the day before. So why not call a spade a spade, and use the term 'World First' when somebody kills something, you know, for the first time worldwide? Otherwise, it's only fair to post another news article with the same fanfare for US, EU, TW, and even KR-first kills.</div></div><hr />

Actually, if you would read the statements from either side, you might know something. Saronite bombs in this fight were a very, very big benefit. I think Ensidia might have got it without the bombs and the 72h seems kinda bad. But still it's not world first. Just suck it. Gotta love Ensidia fanbois. Grats Paragon.</div></div><hr />

Stop trolling it, Paragon fanboi. Ensidia got world first, now suck it up. Its not their fault they didnt have bug-free encounter. Do you even realize how many bugs are abused on daily basis by joes like you? Probably not, otherwise you wouldnt come with this BS.<br />
<br />
Even a freaking shatter combo from a frost mage is nothing but a bug that turned into spec defining ability in the end.<br />
<br />
Or getting a 4th crit from combustion.<br />
<br />
Or skipping adds in azol nerub before 2nd boss by vanishing after aggro, making them despawn (something people with brains do on daily basis, at least me).<br />
<br />
These bugs have never been fixed, and will never be. So in the end, it doesnt matter what bugs help ensidia, and they had no clue whatsoever what was causing them.</div></div><hr />

No sane person will say that Ensidias kill was the legit world 1st - it's just that it would have been if Blizzard wouldn't have fucked up and fixed the problem or instead of banning them reset Arthas. In the end it all comes down that there is no guild which can claim that world 1st without some kind of bad aftertaste and there is only one to blame for that: Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Probably spent 10+ tries on him with an alt raid. so it's not that impressive given the fact that they were 1 day (?) behind ensidia. Still gz on the kill.<br />

Ahm no, unless you think this news wouldn't have gotten them banned - now they're set back regarding hard modes, so either they don't care much about them (what's very hard to believe) or it really happened like they said and they had no idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I meant after they had been banned, they should have come clean with a similar statement. The last bit is just because I really really want to see some of these guys put it all on the line. You think a guaranteed WF by Ensidia wouldn't up the ante a bit? And if they delivered... Just think of the fanboy frenzy that would ensue.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I realize they're behind, but Yogg-0 didn't go down until months after normal dropped; I REALLY hope one week isn't the difference on Arthas.</div></div><hr />

that's correct (quoted from the ensidia site):<br />

<br />
Well, many of you saw the information on MMO-Champion:<br />
<br />
Paragon killed the Lich King a couple of minutes ago and we will assume that this kill is bug-free and will make everyone happy. Fun fact: they killed him on the first try. Congratulations to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds awesome right? But when you check the paragon-webpage:<br />
<br />
We started with our alt raid first to scout the tactics, as he proved to be fairly challenging for a normal mode encounter. After we had the tactics pinned down, we logged our main characters, and went on to one-shot the boss in that raid.<br />
<br />

I noticed that Paragon rogues also have Engineering as a Profession, I'm also going to assume that Paragon's Rogues use Saronite Bombs to maximise their DPS as well; so if they had put in their tries on wednesday as well, maybe Paragon would have gotten a 72hr ban instead.

What're you people on? If we would compare this to Baseball Ensidia would be the roid-using players with the exceptionally high ego. They cheated and they don't care that they cheated in their eyes, while everyone else is just a stepping stone. Now I'm almost sad they didn't get permabanned, the game would be a hell of a lot better without them.<br />

So if Ensidia had held off their tries until monday, and Paragon had gone in and found this bug, but carried on with their kill(as I'm sure they would feeling confident about getting world 1st), then Paragon would have gone and got banned. Would everyone be flaming Paragon now for exploiting their way to a world first?<br />
<br />
When a ref makes a bad call in a baseball game which gives one side soem kind of advantage(say maybe an extra base or point(is it jsut called a point) in baseball[I'm english, so the rules of baseball are alittle fuxxy to me]) Then does that side who got the extra base/point go to the ref and say &quot;hold on a minute, I think we shouldn't get this advantage and that play (or throw or w/e) should be done again&quot;, no, they dont.</div></div><hr />

Does that make me really awesome at the game or just some ordinary guy that presses one of three buttons repeatedly for 5 minute?</div></div><hr />

I might not be right, but you must admit that this seems weird.<br />

That rumour was on ToGC. The image with the SS' key-bindings is just a joke...</div></div><hr />

It wasnt a rumour, it's a fact :)<br />
<br />
14 members offline, a alt guild with only warlocks, so it's more than just a rumour.</div></div><hr />

If we would compare this to Baseball Ensidia would be the roid-using players with the exceptionally high ego. They cheated and they don't care that they cheated in their eyes, while everyone else is just a stepping stone. Now I'm almost sad they didn't get permabanned, the game would be a hell of a lot better without them.<br />

That's where you're wrong bro. The community (at least this one) needs an angle. We need someone to play good/bad, and every raiding cycle theres a new addition to the plot. The hooplah surrounding first kills is the one of the most unifying and polarizing aspects of WoW. It's part of what makes the game fun even when you're not playing.<br />
<br />
Sit back and enjoy the drama.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see these guilds once Deathwing is killable not tell anyone what happened, see how the kiddo's react when they don't know which of their e-peen stroking gods killed pixels first.</div></div><hr />

spoil alert!!!<br />
If you do the encounter normally, every1 dies and later gets ressurected and then you enter the last phase of the ballte. I dont know what happens with the buffs, if you have to get rebuffed or they stay, but its a good explanation why every1 has new buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno about this is wrong or right. But if they wiped 13 timed on alts, then it's more than easy to one shot after on mains.<br />
<br />
Right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's not cheating when it is very well known that the bombs are used in any skilled min/maxing rogues rotation. The only reason it didn't happen to another guild was because:<br />
<br />
A) it was hot fixed before they killed it<br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
B) even with the bugged encounter they couldn't manage to kill it before the hot fix.<br />
<br />
Either way bad luck for Ensidia grats Paragon on technical world first but definitely not 1 shot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right? <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe but the underlying point that everyone talking about attempts seems to be missing is that they killed him. There are hundreds of other guilds no doubt doing alt runs but still wiping until all their attempts are gone. <br />
<br />
Then the fact that they did do it in 1 attempt after switching to their mains is still impressive. I don't know how the fight goes but wipes happen over the silliest things sometimes, especially if you've got the pressure of a potential world first happening in your raid. <br />
<br />
Regardless, grats to them :D</div></div><hr />
