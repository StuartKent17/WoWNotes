Important : If you're getting virus alerts from the patch (from the Blizzard downloader or from here, it doesn't matter), please read this post (https://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=110636194&amp;sid=1) on the official forums.<br />
We've been in the process of investigating this issue and we have been able to confirm that this is indeed a false-positive detection by a few anti-viruses in regards to the Blizzard Downloader. The Blizzard Downloader, which is used to download patches, does not contain a trojan, virus, or other malicious code.<br />
<br />
We have been working directly with many anti-virus companies to resolve this, some of which have already deployed updated virus definitions that resolve this error. We recommend updating your definitions if you've received this false positive related to the Blizzard Downloader, and that you continue to check for updates as a resolution should be available soon if it is not already.<br />

Don't forget that even if this warning is false, it doesn't mean that all of them are. Don't go retarded with your antivirus thinking that you're safe. You're never safe on the interweb, the bad guys, they're watching us, everywhere.</div></div><hr />

For instance i bout my Merciless Gladiator Satin Hood, and the character long hair comes through the Hood. Blizz confirmed it will be fixed in the next patch(god knows when that will be). I was wondering .... y delay it and then release it and still buggy =). Btw it was so wild and hard to buy it, close to 300-400 ppl were in Area 52 and it was very laggy + everyone was sitting on top of the new vendor on purpose.</div></div><hr />

Have you heard any mention of Blizzard implementing changes to create incentive to have people buy their whole Arena 2 sets? As it is with the minor upgrades that they are, it seems many might opt to double up on the two-piece +35 resilience bonus.</div></div><hr />
