Addon Review - Archaeology Helper (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Archaeology Helper (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/arh.aspx) is the perfect compliment to Archy. It enables nodes to be displayed on a HUD using GatherMate2 (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/gathermate2.aspx). You need both addons enabled to fully utilize ARH.<br />
<br />
After installing the addons, you will first notice the addon toolbar that appears in the center of your screen. Click and drag anywhere on it that is not a button to reposition it. Mousing over each button or area will tell you what it does. Using ARH is simple, just survey and select the color you got after aiming your character in the same direction as the telescope is pointing. You can either use the buttons on the included toolbar or bind keys in the settings. Making sure not to move until after marking is important to increase the accuracy of the overlay zones.<br />
<br />
Generally the fastest way to clear a digsite is starting at a randomly selected node on the off chance that you actually pick the right one. The fragment is very rarely on the red line when surveying, so pick a side close to where the red area starts and check for that fragment. When looking at the HUD, the red circle surrounding your player arrow shows approximately how far out you can find an object, make sure to stand on the center of known nodes as they are not positioned perfectly. <br />
<br />
Here is a database (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/january/GatherMate2.zip)that is more complete than any other I have found that includes data from Archy, GatherMate2Data, other people, and my own digging, it is still missing a few nodes from higher level Archaeology, so don't be surprised when you find one that isn't included by default. If you are running Archy alongside ARH, make sure to submit your Archy.lua file from SavedVariables to the author's website (http://projects.murderdev.com/archy/default.aspx) (after he fixes it) to increase the nodes in the database!<br />
<br />
Below you can see the HUD overlay during a normal survey and an example three red survey results that lead directly to your fragment. <br />

Nope. If you check out their armory, you can see that all of the druids in that killshot really are level 85 druids in their guild. Must be something about the fight that led to them bringing 11 druids for the kill.</div></div><hr />

That alchemy potion transforms you into a nearby ally if you're stood next to them. If they're in bear form, you'll turn into a bear. <br />
<br />
Seems they were actual druids though, so it's pretty irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

My guess ? Feral stacking while using the 30 min bleeding buff from BRC (30% chance to proc 7k damage on bleeds) = super high damage burst.

Yeah except they are inmune to silence.<br />
<br />
My take on 11 druids is either a typhoon rotation for phase 3 adds or they need the tranquilitys for phase 2. Or maybe both.</div></div><hr />

Back in WotLK I had gearscore addon installed, and after a couple weeks my WoW experience would bog down. It probably had more to do with addon chatter with other gearscore users, but if I would clear the database it'd speed back up for a little while. I then switched to GearScoreLite and had no adverse affects on my experience. Now that Blizzard added the character item level to the UI there is really no need for gearscore anymore. Now if Blizzard would only just add an, &quot;Equipped Item Level&quot; stat to the character pane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't work. Solar Beam interrupts the cast that is going on at the time. It does not prevent the following casts as it's a silence not an interrupt. They, like most raid mobs, are immune to the silence effect.<br />

Ferals can root too... insta root glyph means you lose momentary dps instead of dedicated tanks or other people to kite CC. Roots last essentially the whole duration.</div></div><hr />

Not really relevant to why there are so many.<br />
<br />
However, as someone already said &quot;bring the player&quot; has been explicitly stated by blizzard to not be true for bleeding edge content. They do crazy strats and will stack what they need to. The game is not balanced around world firsts, and the things I have to say about anyone who believes it should be would probably get me banned.<br />
<br />
Go paragon. Woo druids. Lets see if it leads to a change in how it works.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if it's because you can keep refreshing it, or it's just specific to that ability in general, but apparently you can do a truckload of extra damage by stacking up the Stolen Power buff and then using Rip as your first attack (this used up the buff but massively buffs Rip).<br />
<br />
I haven't done the fight and certainly haven't seen this tactic in action, but this is how I understand it. So the &quot;fix&quot; is to change Rip or change the way the buff works.</div></div><hr />

Why isn't it relevant? My point is that Druids can replace any other class making the use of more of them not uncommon. You can have four druids in one raid focusing on four different types of gear because of this difference; it's the same as having a rogue, hunter, holy priest and prot paladin. They're different &quot;classes&quot; or &quot;specs&quot; depending on your opinion/views that bring different abilities to the raid. <br />
<br />
It's hardly the same as stacking say 10 mages or rogues.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I would also hope Blizzard sees it this way as well because that was their own design of the class and must have considered that possibility.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ohforfsake</div><div class="date">2011-01-10, 05:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">@ people &quot;bring the player qq&quot; -- that -=NEVER=- worked for world's first. Blues themselves confirmed that, it's not their goal to balance the game around world's 1st. Remember warlocks stacking? World 1st is a phenomen, a cheat in some way or another, always. They will find a way and bring whatever gives any kind of awkward advantage, something that will never be available for a normal guild. This time it's druids, another kill it might be something else. For cho'gall for example they ditched out all the melee. See what i mean?<br />
<br />
I only want to know what exactly those druids were doing, out of curiosity.. Rooting, most likely.. Instacast roots work great on nef, i could tel that from my very own experience.. And even though im feral dps, popping for 1 second out of cat form to refresh a root doesnt affect my dps anyhow. Probably also offtanking.. And of course all of them could do tranquility, which is extremely potent even in case of feral.<br />
<br />
@ the guy &quot;I would also hope Blizzard sees it this way as well because that was their own design of the class and must have considered that possibility.&quot; -- are you new to this game? All this &quot;Hybrid&quot; approach was nothing but excuse to keep the class gimp for many years. Druids were utter crap in vanilla and half-crap through burning crusade, for anything other than healing, thatnks to that &quot;design&quot; - i spit on it, thank all the gods it's gone. It doesnt work in world of warcraft. The only way to make a class powerful is to lead it on a way of specialisation. That's the only way. And no, having too many druids in one guild, even though different specced, would suck regardless. Class synergy is still very potent, not to mention gearing issues with a limited gear pool in any progression guild.</div></div><hr />

However, as someone already said &quot;bring the player&quot; has been explicitly stated by blizzard to not be true for bleeding edge content. They do crazy strats and will stack what they need to. The game is not balanced around world firsts...<br />
<br />
Let me just stop you right there. What the hell is this game balanced around then?<br />
Everyone keep saying &quot;The game is not balanced around this&quot; when it's something out of the ordinary. What is the game balanced around then? As I see it this game isn't really balanced at all. Not balanced around heavy progressing PvE-guilds. Not around casual &quot;twice-a-week&quot; raiding guilds. Certainly not around PvP.

<br />
Class stacking has and will always be used at the top. They said themselves that they had a clear idea on what to do and tried to execute it, and it worked. Doesn't mean other guilds have to do the same as they did. They simply found out that stacking druids might be able to earn them the kill on Nefarian easier than doing it the &quot;usual way&quot;, smart, I'd say. Can't believe there's people still QQing about this stuff, it has been true since the beginning of the world first-race era.<br />
<br />
The only solution to the class stacking is removing the uniqueness and make everyone have the exact same abilities. Now, that would be fun, right?</div></div><hr />

Grats to Paragon on the kill. Do you have to kill all the end bosses to access Sinestra or just Cho'Gall?<br />

If I'm not mistaken, you only have to kill Cho'gall, then the floor of the room breaks and you can fight her... Atleast that's how it worked.<br />

Around NORMAL PvE progression and NORMAL PvP fight, aka no 1v1 bullshit, and sometimes not even 2v2 arenas.<br />

This is NOT normal PvE progression, it's hardcore... Remember ICC's Saronite bombs trick? Blizz didn't change that because, since it's bleeding edge progression, they won't know what raiders can do.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't give a shit if they pulled off a world first kill using 25 druids.<br />
<br />
As someone said, druids are the ONLY class that can do EVERYTHING, aka tank, heal, melee and range so it's hardly surprising, also considering resto is faceroll along with the OP feral it's even less surprising, people talking about balance are the type of people we call scrubs, accept a game of wows' stature will NEVER be balanced, hell accept any MMORPG will NEVER be balanced and get over it.</div></div><hr />

If i remember correctly Ensidia got a 72hr ban and their world first revoked for that. The bomb exploit was removed etc. etc. after this kill expect blizzard to thoroughly review Druid class mechanics, the fight and hot it interacts with said mechanics and the actual kill strat. I'd also be afraid if i was a druid because of this. We already know a feral nerf is in the works. if they had 11 Druids you can almost expect a cross the board Druid nerf because of something like this. Pallies may have been stacked on HLK, but not to this extent. 11/25 is 44% of the raid comp. Blizzard WILL be quadruple checking this fight.</div></div><hr />

Well, in my opinion, its balanced mainly around PvP. <br />
Almost every single class nerf, tweak etc and even down to some bizarre item changes, all occur because of PvP.<br />
It's an endless balancing act that will never be balanced until either there is only one class in WoW or the two games are separated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as it relates to the druid discussion, I guess we'll never know. not sure Blizzard has ever really had an intention of nerfing druids &quot;Across the board&quot;. <br />
<br />
we don't even have any information as to why 11 druids were used nor can anyone truly confirm that it was 11 druids and not the alchemy potion, so on that issue i'll keep a tight lip, but I will say that the accomplishments of a record setting guild, like paragon, on one fight, using whatever composition, will most probably not decide the &quot;nerf&quot; of a class. Blizzard may alter fight mechanics, but I don't see them giving druids a swift nerf kick.</div></div><hr />

That wasn't a trick, that was plain abusement of game mechanics and there have been many of the same kind. It's known to most people as, cheating. That Nihilum rerolled engineering on 20characters (even healers and tanks) and then trying to hide the real reason behind it just shows that they knew themselves that they were in fact, cheating. And yeah, PvP is not balanced and arena is nowhere near &quot;balanced&quot; when there are these huge classgaps like it is in the game right now. And normal PvE-progression, well..

<br />
not sure you can call it that, I don't want to stand up to them or anything but I think it would've been impossible to know what would have been causing the bug. a player using saronite bombs in his/her rotation cant possibly know that it is those bombs that are causing game mechanics to crash. they certainly knew that something was amiss, but to say that they knew exactly what they did to cause it I think would be pretty impossible. also, I think its normal for pure dps classes to be topping out dmg done in a PvE environment, and its almost always normal for Hpallies to top up healing on fights which are not AoE healing intensive (they are almost always on the tank solo and the tank is always taking damage, so there is something to heal. other healing classes would have their heals registered as overheals when no dmg is going out on the raid. <br />
<br />
I do agree with PvP class imbalance, but by the same token, class mixes can negate that to a very large degree in an arena environment, even with massive gaps. <br />
<br />
on a last note, just want to say that I don't think high end raiding guilds have fun unless they get their names credited with world firsts.</div></div><hr />

What this mean? They have this tactic from beta and they're well prepare to do all bosses so like they did on concil with no melees if next boss ask to stack 10 holy palas for aura mastery or aLocks they will use it because they're racing for this world 1st before cataclym hit.<br />
I supose all fights can be done by anykind of player and combo when they are in proper gear so bring the player and not the class is not apply to world 1st. probably 95% of us will kill that boss when overgear that fight. They still are undergear many of them still have blues and its Heroic mode not design for casuals so pro ppl will use any advance they can get and maximize all class. Remember lk heroic? How many melees did they have? How many of them were dk? How many were palas with auramastery spec?</div></div><hr />

As it should be.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way, blizzard makes them game monotonous, grinding and extremely difficult so that the average joe can not play the game. What happens? profits drop, less development, less designers, game changes less and has less patches(IE content) and therefor goes stagnant, that is the end of the game. I'm sure some over zealous fanboi will jump on me that wow CAN'T die but i assure you it can. Blizzard knows they have to keep their income up and they need to keep their players happy and the MAJORITY of players are more interested in it being balanced at the level of an average player than want either extremes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Clearly you have some unresolved issues with Blizzard? You're clearly not seeing point, and if you are, you don't understand it. My only point is druids can fill any role making the use of more druids easily understandable. <br />
<br />
I don't care what your issue is, it has nothing to do with my point. Stacking 11 druids of different specs is different than stacking even 11 paladins because of their role abilities.</div></div><hr />

That database needs to go in to your specific account folder, not the normal addons folder.<br />
ie. /WTF/Account/accntname/realm/character/SavedVariables<br />
<br />
They weren't showing up on mine until I put GatherMate2.lua file in that particular folder.<br />
<br />
And btw, if you have over-written the GatherMate2.lua file in the normal /Interface/AddOns/GatherMate2 folder, then re-install the addon so that it puts the original GatherMate2.lua back in there.<br />

You're assuming that they not only read all the posts before their own, but that they also aren't just trying to keep the Troll'in Roll'in.<br />

My guess would be they are just trying to &quot;stir the pot&quot;, as we used to say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
During the Heroic Nefarian encounter 5 people get Mind Controlled and build up a debuff that makes your next attack do 2500% (?) more damage. The Feral ability, Rip, takes advantage of that by having all of it's ticks increased by the 2500%. So Rip ticks for 500,000+ for it's entire duration. That + Tranquility being OP for Electrocute is why they brought them. Eventually Rip should be fixed.<br />

My point is that Druids can replace any other class making the use of more of them not uncommon. You can have four druids in one raid focusing on four different types of gear because of this difference; it's the same as having a rogue, hunter, holy priest and prot paladin. They're different &quot;classes&quot; or &quot;specs&quot; depending on your opinion/views that bring different abilities to the raid. <br />
<br />
It's hardly the same as stacking say 10 mages or rogues.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I would also hope Blizzard sees it this way as well because that was their own design of the class and must have considered that possibility.<br />
<br />
Except outside of trinkets they only use 2 types of gear...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has been going on since day 1 WoW release on world firsts. 15 soulstones, 11 druids etc.<br />
<br />
99% of casuals can't even do heroics yet, they won't see normal nef until T12 and even further for anything heroic. There are still boatloads of full 346 85's trying to kill HLK.<br />
<br />
And don't expect nerfs inc due to this, as stated before every world first kill has used one gimmick or another.</div></div><hr />

So its not anything bad, just a mistake made by blizzard that ppl used into their own benefit and that will be hotfixed soon like anub/hodir were.<br />
<br />
Also it has nothing to do with druids beeing out of balance, its about blizzard making a flawed encounter with a mechanic that wasnt tested out and by doing so leaving room for ppl to use that mechanic on world first kills in the way it wasnt ment to be.</div></div><hr />

Read up two posts on the previous page ..... or look at my post at the top of page 8.<br />

<br />
There have been several times in past when a end boss hasn't been tested and bugs have gone live. I was under the impression that every attempt that is near a world first is watched by the GM's. So far the story goes that they watch but do not interject when they see a bug being abused but rather let it play out or hotfix it. <br />
<br />
People have compared this kill to that of Ensidia's where they found the bug with saronite bombs, no one said they couldn't, they stacked a profession to achieve a world first and used a bug I am sure they thought something dodgy about it. At the same time how can the idea that Rip has the damage buff per tick not be seen as a bit dodgy? Stacking profession and stacking a class for the use of a bug is somehow different? <br />
<br />
I will never be in a top guild, I am happy with my crew but what I find a bit off is the fact we cannot even look to these guilds for legitimate strategies because Blizz in their wisdom found that the strategies used were wrong. The Rip damage per tick was so wrong it was hotfixed ( so far as I can make out) Does this not count as an exploit to knowingly use something that gives an unfair advantage. There is nothing wrong in my view of stacking a class or profession, as long as there is skill or tactic behind it, the Rip damage buff was just blatantly overpowered and used to strong handedly trivialize an encounter. <br />
<br />
There were several druids in that raid that were no where near geared for even heroic dungeons let alone heroic mode raid, but their bugged damage was obviously more useful than bringing a geared and skilled player.</div></div><hr />

I've seen some incorrect answers to this question. The fact that they chose to have so many druids was because a bug with the ability &quot;Rip&quot;. If you google the video and watching it, you'll be watching it for a druids Point of View seeing some hits cause 800k damage. Even if you were a Balance druid.<br />
