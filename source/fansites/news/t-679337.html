That's just it, it's not really a buff (if it is, it's tiny). It keeps our DPS very close to the same, but removes the clunky mechanic of weapon swapping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because, if you'd follow the blue posts you would have known this, Blizzard was unhappy with the clumsy mechanic of rogues having to switch weapons in midfight for optimal usage of poisons. It was to the point that an addon was developed for it. It *was* clumsy and it *was* annoying and since good rogues were doing manually what Blizzard has implemented now as a part of the class, the only actual dps rise you'll see from rogues is the ones who have no clue what they're doing - if they're using the right poisons to begin with.<br />
<br />
And I suppose a small dps increase for the good rogues who weren't using that fool-proof addon and occasionally screwed up.<br />
<br />
I am no rogue, but really I find it a bit sad on your part to have tears over the fact a class' mechanic was fixed.<br />

<br />
I wouldn't be at all suprised to see more changes resulting in ruptureless cycles becoming obsolete. While I wouldn't welcome the change it marries up with rogue playstyle.<br />
<br />
This change will have the net result of bringing muti up to combat, it should now be a playstyle choice on muti/combat which imo is about as good as it gets.</div></div><hr />

Killing a tank/healer/dps to give one (two if you BRes the dead person) buffed player (and one unbuffed player) is an insignificant DPS increase if at all due to the loss of another person. And if you re-buff the dead Ret, then that's GCD loss over-all throughout the raid buffers so no gain there either.<br />

So, essentially, you'd agree with me saying that rogues are being rewarded for abusing a game mechanic as it became clear to the blues they would not stop doing so? That's pretty much what's happened here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not the weapon-swapping that was the issue. The issue was the Poisonswapper addon that, that for all intents and purposes, automated the weapon swapping. Blizzard wants class-specific addons to be optional and not mandatory towards playing the particular class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Weapon-swapping midfight is not an abuse of game mechanics. Using an addon to automate the swapping in such away that all you do is apply the poisons and let the addon do the rest of the work created a situation where Rogues felt that said addon was a necessity to optimize their DPS. This is the primary issue Blizzard has a bone to pick with. Would you rather they just disable weapon swapping for all classes? Non-rogue melee players would be in an uproar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, it's not a buff but a mechanic fix to make the weapon swapping addon that was considered mandatory by many obsolete. The dps of good rogues who constantly optimize did not increase from this change.<br />
<br />
Secondly, why the heck would you care about a rogue PvE dps? The blues have already came out and said they are supposed to be #1 dps on the meters when everyone is on equal gear and skill. This doesn't really effect pvp at all since it requires 5 DP stacks to trigger and last I checked not many actually use DP in PvP.</div></div><hr />

Having to keep up HfB, Rupture, don't stand in fire, and keep a track on DP was fun for me. Ofcourse it could be stressfull sometimes and that's why I like the change, also because fights where you have to swap targets alot, the benefit from weaponswapping was very small.<br />
<br />
All-in-all, I like the changes. Looks nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.s. One more thing that made weaponswapping nice what the fact that if you had 3 weapons with Berserking enchant, they all had a chance of procing and I have often before had 3 Berserking buffs up at the same time.</div></div><hr />

I would assume that the buff on yourself would be removed if you unequipped the item. If not, they'd surely implement the aforementioned mechanic, or reduce the duration of soul fragments to the point where this wouldn't be worth doing.<br />
<br />
On the topic of rogue weapon swapping though, good times! Can't say I enjoyed using an addon to improve my dps and I'm glad I won't have to come 3.3. Those of you crying that this'll be a buff, well, it'll be a decent buff to PvE mutilate, perhaps enough to make it a valid choice next to combat for most fights. Combat will see a small, if any, increase to it's dps and this is the spec that is doing fine. <br />
<br />
And gz locks to threat reduction! that's a welcome change if anything.</div></div><hr />

I highly doubt Shadowmourne will have sockets. Think about it on both a technical and concept point. Blizz doesn't have the code in place to transfer gems from Shadow Edge when you turn it in for Shadowmourne and on a concept level you're filling in the gaping holes (sockets) with all the stuff you gather up for the quest chain.</div></div><hr />

you're prolly correct, the &quot;watered down&quot; pre-legendary shadow's edge has those sockets, to actually make it epiccccc and cool, but once you get the legendary one, with it's proc, having 2-3 sockets might seem a bit over the top :&gt;</div></div><hr />

To me this is very interresting data and I can't wait to try this out in raids on live servers (gear has improved alot on live :))<br />
The testing is also done with a 1.80 speed dagger in Off-Hand rather than a 1.40, since I don't have that on the PTR, sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I guess if you play a rogue you would know how the dps would be compared to stats, and I would say that if you play a rogue you should know how Instant Poison, Melee attacks and Mutilate was on the Detail Window compared to eachother before the change and if you did or did not weaponswap.<br />
<br />
I find it interresting to find Instant Poison above Melee attacks, and it would go even higher with a 1.40 speed dagger in Off-Hand. I see this change could be more of a buff than someone would think. That's just my opinion anyway.<br />
<br />
If I could log on the live server I could probably do the same there but maintenance is kinda screwing up that idea :P</div></div><hr />

Also, what stat would you like then? I am sure to hell I would take ArP over hit if your hit capped, even as a retri, and no need to have expertise if your capped on that part either, so what stat is left? Armor Penetration.</div></div><hr />

Exp is kinda rare tho lately, im having 541 hit with only gear and so far nothing to replace it with.. while having 15 exp only.. so ye exp would be a nice stats. (sig atm is in pvp gear, but armory in pve if u wanna check :P )<br />

<br />
<br />
I remember it, it was a hunter new recruit to the guild that made the post about it. The guild justified it by saying the two hunters in the raid were new and had gotten loot. Also that the rogue out performed them, so he was rewarded for it. I feel thats how it should be...the good players should be rewarded over the ones being carried or not pulling weight. Its a guilds business who they give loot to, same thing with Shadowmourne. If a hunter ends up doing mad dps over all the crappy DK's and Paladins...he should be rewarded.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vulon'Nah</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 03:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I'm really glad that they put a class restriction on it.<br />
<br />
Hunters don't even USE melee weapons for fuck's sake. All they provide is extra stats. And if someone claims to be a &quot;melee hunter&quot;...well, they should probably shove their head in a blender.<br />
<br />
Stick to your bows. That's what the class is made for. Besides, agility is the stat they should be aiming for, not strength, which is what Shadow's Edge gives.<br />
<br />
That also applies to Thori'dal and rogues/warriors. Its absolutely ridiculous to give it to a class that barely benefits from it, unless the hunters in the raid were RIDICULOUSLY bad, and if they were that bad, they shouldn't be raiding.<br />
<br />
Since Shadow's Edge is a quest reward, its unlikely that a Hunter could &quot;steal&quot; it even if they could USE it. But, then again, there might be a drop that begins the quest in the first place.<br />
<br />
I stand by my past statement. If a hunter tried to steal something like this, the words that would come out of my mouth would melt nearby soap on contact.</div></div><hr />

Wtb another explain of these new tier 10 rules how to get them etc etc<br />
<br />
<br />
On the PTR it looks like you buy your T10 i251 gear with emblems of frost (95 for chest/helm/legs and 60 for shoulder/gloves). To get i264 you need a class group specific Mark of Sanctification and to turn in your old i251 item. Vanquisher's Mark of Sanctification is for Druid, Rogue, DK and Mage for example. To get i277 you need a Heroic Mark of Sanctification and turn in your old i264 item.<br />
<br />
The other emblem gear is 30 for idols/sigil/totem/libram, 50 for back pieces, 60 for trinket/glove/belt, 95 for chest. All i264. Primoridial Saronite is buyable at 23.</div></div><hr />

Shadowform: <br />
<br />
This talent also now causes Devouring Plague and Vampiric Touch to benefit from haste. Both the period length and the duration of these spells will be reduced by haste. In addition, the mana cost has been reduced from 32% to 13% of base mana. <br />
<br />
SHAMAN<br />
<br />
Elemental Mastery: <br />
<br />
This talent now increases spell haste by 15% instead of critical strike chance while active. <br />

The spirit can be nice for the extra spell power from fel armor and glyph of life tap... I'd rather have that than more stam, but since Blizzard is looking to make it so locks and mages don't use spirit at all in Cataclysm they are probably trying to stear away from it early... that would be fine and dandy if they would make fel armor, etc. scale off something other than spirit such as int...</div></div><hr />

<br />
you could go 1,8 - 1,8 mutilate or 1,8 - 1,4, there was like no difference in dmg output (since instant poison normalization).<br />
<br />
Now you get an IP proc every time you get a DP proc (@5 stacks), which is not normalized. so weapon speed matters a lot again. this change will bringt a LOT more dmg through poison. 30% deadly proc + 20 % Improved Poisons will be 50% deadly proc for every offhand hit. and that will be as well 50% IP proc and that is awesome.

From the looks of it, it should work as long as the fight has ended. As for the update, it's not going to affect me. I mean personally, when I cast it, it's usually when the raid has fallen apart, and the boss(es) are running around one-shotting everyone. :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, essentially, you'd agree with me saying that rogues are being rewarded for abusing a game mechanic as it became clear to the blues they would not stop doing so? That's pretty much what's happened here.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how swapping weapons in midfight is abusing game mechanics, there's a reason the only piece of gear you can change in combat is a weapon. That's not an exploit, that's intended.<br />
<br />
Top players want to do top dps (or healing, or tanking). If that involves swapping weapons every x seconds in a fight, people will do that. What's more, more and more rogues went and used that. It started to become standard. An addon was developed to eliminate the chance to screw up. Blizzard saw this all happen over the course of a few months and decided to wait until they saw this kind of gameplay for rogues became standard and not just something exceptional (said so in several blue posts). Apparently, it became standard enough for Blizzard to add this change to Deadly Poison. Dps wise, it won't change much. The only thing it will change is make playing a rogue more comfortable and more fun. What's the issue with that?<br />
<br />
Rogues' dps is good because of the weapon swapping (if you're in a good guild, anyways, I can expect your rogues to have been swapping weapons too). Nothing will have changed. Rogues should not skyrocket and suddenly do 1k more on every fight. And even if they do, well, fine, at least one stupid mechanic is out of the way and something will be nerfed to get rogues back in line.<br />
<br />
Swapping a weapon every now and then is fine (back in Spirit based days, I'd swap to a heavy spirit weapon for innervate/evocation, for example), but seeing one class use it as a standard procedure to do dps that is still on par with most of the other dps classes isn't fine.</div></div><hr />

It looks like you'll go 0 to 360, then to 0 again when you unleash Chaos Bane. So it's like having average 180 strength up full-time which is like an additional relic.</div></div><hr />

That's pretty much what's happened here.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's the exact same thing with WF / GoA totem twisting. To max dps a good shaman had to twist now SoE gets GoA for free was that &quot;rewarding exploits&quot;? No the fact is stacking up full DP and wasting additional DP additions is stupid when poisons account for such a large % of rogues overall damage.<br />
<br />
The only problem I see with this is the DP 5 stack change along with the 10% additional application rate will push HfB mute head and shoulders above Combat and the fact that T9 and T10 is still so terribly itemized for Mute means that rogues are still going to be sporting 4piece T8 in T10 content simply cause the set bonus is so godly and ArPen does so little for Mute.<br />
<br />
As a combat rogue who just hit the ArPen soft cap the thought of building up a mute set for 3.3 is a kick in the jewels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you could go 1,8 - 1,8 mutilate or 1,8 - 1,4, there was like no difference in dmg output (since instant poison normalization).<br />
<br />
Now you get an IP proc every time you get a DP proc (@5 stacks), which is not normalized. so weapon speed matters a lot again. this change will bringt a LOT more dmg through poison. 30% deadly proc + 20 % Improved Poisons will be 50% deadly proc for every offhand hit. and that will be as well 50% IP proc and that is awesome.

And even 65% after envenom.</div></div><hr />

The issue won't be the rep so much as your Engineering path... Apparently Goblin Engineers make the Ammo and Gnome Engineers make the Arrows... which I'll find very annoying as a Hunter to quickly make some munitions real fast mid raid when I run low.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Agreed. And 360 strength + finish aoe blow is very nice in most cases when you want to top the dps abit. think about that one along with death's choice/verdict and a nobles trinket. 360+450(/510)+90+300=1200(/1260) strength if all of them procc together. Ouch. Or rather you might be at about +300+ strength pretty much all the time.</div></div><hr />

While, I think that they need to make the warlock threat modifiers 15/30% (instead of the 10/20% since most classes in the games have a 30% reduction, and some even have a 40% reduction), Blizz is still finally on track and doing something about Warlock threat. That makes me happy. Very happy, in fact. Ty Blizz.Hunters have no threat reduction modifiers at all.<br />
<br />
And before you mention Feign Death, I will point you to the hilariously high resist rate due to spell hit versus physical hit. Even if a Hunter gears for the full 8% physical hitcap, they still &quot;enjoy&quot; a 7% resist rate on Feign Death, and this goes even higher if the Hunter is using Focused Aim for higher DPS (as it does NOT help Feign Death). My FD resist rate is something inane like 11%.</div></div><hr />

This is true. I don't love ArPen on shadowmourne, I can live with it, its a legendary ffs (3.7 speed yes plz). But Arpen on the most recent pally tier? Thats a joke. Would be like putting spellpower on the tier again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of those, CS and DS, plus your white damage, are benefited by ArPen. Now, I'm not a Ret expert by any means, but the percentage of damage that you generate from those HAS to be higher than the percent of damage generated by the abilities that Hunters have that gain from Haste (basically our white damage and Steady Shot BARELY), and yet they're STILL putting nigh-worthless Haste on our tier gear.<br />

Sorry but in my ignorance that seems to make no sense. You'd have to have multiple paladins die which means they would not be contributing at all to the fight, even if they were brought back up and rebuffed that still doesn't seem to be worth having a few people get another 40 seconds of bloodlust compared to the dps lost to the DI/latency/time to rebuff themselves and rebuff others/cancel the DI bubble, etc etc. I guess if you had everything timed perfectly in preparation for it it'd be worth it, but I really don't see it as so gamebreaking that they would remove it so we're now back to if you DI someone to simply save yourself and 1 other repair money then they're screwed if the wipe happens just after a Heroism. <br />

In all fairness, both haste and ArP are incredibly weak stats for ret. With haste just barely beating out ArP. The issues is that ret scales with practically nothing other then STR. Hit/expertise cap through gear and then go full bore on STR isn't exactly a fun gearing plan.<br />
<br />
I'm not a hunter expert, but I hesitate to say that haste is any better for ret. You're comparing white swings and seals with auto attacks, casted shots, and pet attacks.</div></div><hr />

My guess is to keep things balanced, or at least try. Plenty of other pure's have received nerf's/buff's the same way Rogues have as of late. For 2 patches in a row, rogue AoE DPS was nerfed into the ground, so they are obviously trying to build Muti rogues back up.<br />
<br />
If you look at the other pure's, they are getting buffed to, so the rogue buff is needed, and appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And if Haste is better than half a point of Strength for Ret, than it's better than Haste for Hunters. (Haste is worth 31% of a point of Agility for me. Hell, one point of ATTACK POWER is better than one point of Haste.)</div></div><hr />

Honestly, that's the worst input on a change I've ever seen. Who'd be able to stack a minimum of 6x DP in 2 seconds? Yes, 6 stacks, because 5 wouldn't affect you dieing faster at all. What makes you an even more obvious troll is your rant about &quot;stunlocks&quot;, which in this case would equal half of a cheap shot before you're dead. As far as I know, all classes except priests can stun for at least 2 seconds in one go, but they've still got their fear.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, I can't find GC's post at the moment, but he's said that rogues are a bit OP in PvP with all of their cooldowns available - while being too squishy when they're not.

<br />
(not sure of crystallized shadows is spelt right, but meh)</div></div><hr />

The dps of good rogues who constantly optimize did not increase from this change.<br />
<br />
Secondly, why the heck would you care about a rogue PvE dps? The blues have already came out and said they are supposed to be #1 dps on the meters when everyone is on equal gear and skill. This doesn't really effect pvp at all since it requires 5 DP stacks to trigger and last I checked not many actually use DP in PvP.<br />
<br />
Everyone top rogue uses wound/deadly and those that don't are just stubborn and will eventually switch over because its that good.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Conrose</div><div class="date">2009-11-22, 02:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So question about the Rogue Changes... how will the new Deadly Poison mechanic work with Shiv? More interestingly what sorta potency can we expect to see from Assassination FoK spam in AoE centric encounters with both the changes making it conceivable of applying full stacks of DP to all targets.<br />
<br />
Then there is also the question of what it could mean for PvE Subtlety Rogues, especially with the HAT bug fix. HAT is primarily about popping alot of Eviscerates while placing priority on SnD and Rupture up-time. With the DP change, could I accomplish competitive damage with Slow/Instant Poison MH and a Fast/Deadly Poison Offhand while using Shivs to compliment HAT Generated Combo Points... Shiving only if I hit 56 Energy without having 5 combo point so as to avoid losing more than one HAT generated Combo Point... could a similar shift from Sinister Strike to Shiv potentially occur with Combat Builds?<br />
<br />
Would it buff Instant Poison enough to make it more valuable than wound poison for the currently accepted Combat PvE builds?</div></div><hr />

Shiv is 38 energy and guarantees another poison &quot;proc&quot;, and an offhand swing is 50% and costs 0 energy. This assumes you're assassination of course. HAT is so boring that I and many others would rather quit if it clearly outperforms any other spec. Combat might want to spec imp. poisons but I still doubt it'd make it the &quot;new&quot; mechanic good enough to prioritize shiv over anything else.</div></div><hr />
