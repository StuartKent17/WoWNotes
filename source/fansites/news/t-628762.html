Survavibility and fun in Arenas<br />
I would say we are definitely worried that players are dying too fast, particularly to a handful of specs that combine high damage with high survivability. We know resilience will make a difference, but they jury is still out on whether it will make enough of a difference. Regardless, it's clear a lot of players aren't having fun, so it is something we are talking about. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14134474969-gc-please-stop-posting-here.html))<br />
<br />
[...] All I have ever said was that damage will be lower when everyone is at full resilience. Will damage be low enough then? I have never answered that because I think the jury is out. I understand many players think damage will still be too high. We certainly take their opinions (and numbers) into account when we discuss it.

1v1 PvP<br />
We do not balance 1v1 PvP. We make virtually no attempt to insure that all specs are viable at dueling. It's a fun distraction at best, perhaps a way to test our your abilities against a specific class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14133094102-daily--awesome-gc-comment--healers.html))<br />

Damage / Healing / Crowd Control in Arenas<br />
Yes, I said that. If you are disagreeing with that remark, then you are essentially saying &quot;It shouldn't be a viable tactic to kill a healer.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you aren't saying that, then all we're really quibbling over is a matter of degree.<br />
<br />
I didn't say it should be trivial to kill a healer. I purposefully didn't specify how many people it should take to kill a healer. I didn't say that we were happy with how easy it is to currently kill a healer. But if you are anticipating a point where you just laugh at warriors or shamans or other classes without brutal CC and drains, then you might be disappointed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14133094102-daily--awesome-gc-comment--healers.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I made an unclear post that ended up setting a lot of people off. I did not mean dps classes should be able to faceroll healers. I did not mean that one dps should be a match for one healer. I did not mean that CC should have no role in Arenas. I did not mean that healing should have no role in Arenas. I did not mean that we think healers are finally getting their just deserts in season 5.<br />
<br />
The best way I can think to say it is: Burst damage should not dominate Arenas. Crowd control should not dominate Arenas. Healing should not dominate Arenas.<br />
<br />
I don't think this is really news to people who have been doing Arenas very long. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14133215076-no-gc-your-wrong.html))<br />
<br />
[...] My point was that we don't give every spec the ability to stunlock, sheep or silence. And we're not going to. But those specs still need to feel like they can contribute in an Arena. Understanding the concerns now, I should have said something more like &quot;It should still be possible for warriors and shamans to take on and sometimes defeat healers (even if it takes 2v1 or 3v1 or whatever).&quot; Crowd control should not be the dominant factor in Arenas. Neither should burst damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14133094102-daily--awesome-gc-comment--healers.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I will just leave it at this: When you put a healer on your team, you need to feel that the dps you lose from not having another dps class is more than offset by the survivability brought by the healing. I'm cool with all damage teams existing, so long as there aren't too many of them and they take big risks from neglecting healing.

Heirloom items and LVL 1-79 balance<br />
We do take them into consideration. For example, we do put some thought into the structure of the talent trees based on when classes get new abilities. Part of the whole design of hierloom items was to give players who have reached max level a reason to go try another (for some of us, yet another) class.<br />
<br />
We don't spend much effort balancing PvP or PvE for levels below the max level, since nearly all player balance concerns are about max level. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14132915134-question-for-gc.html))<br />

No Deadly/Hateful Band of Salvation available<br />

<br />
ETA on Healing mechanics changes<br />
I have given an ETA and I will give another one. It will be a long time. Do not look for it in the next patch or so. We want to take a comprehensive look at healing the way we did at tanking, and that took a long time. Healing may even be trickier to change. I also always add when I comment on this topic that you should not assume that all or even most healers hate healing or even find it clunky at best. Many players love healing and we have to be careful not to break the game for them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14133094102-daily--awesome-gc-comment--healers.html))<br />
<br />
51 Points talents<br />
That is not our design. If the 51-point talent defines the tree then you are closing the door on a hybrid spec of some kind ever being viable. The rest of a talent tree should not be filler to reach the 51 pointer. That is why we budget them exactly the same as the first tier talents. Now there are specs for which the 51 feels more mandatory and those for which it feels less mandatory. We’re okay with that too.

Rune Strike<br />
Rune Strike is largely to make up for the fact that DK tanks are really penalized for failing to land attacks. For example if you open with a Plague Strike and get a miss or dodge, your rotation is thrown off and your threat will be lower.<br />
<br />
It is dependent on a proc so that you have an incentive to hit other buttons and to make it less useful when doing dps. It is on next swing so that it doesn't tie up a GCD. It can't be avoided so that DKs who miss a Plague Strike and a Rune Strike aren't doubly screwed.

Cat and Scorpid changes in 3.0.8<br />
I don’t think I was clear enough: the PTR build does not reflect the new numbers for cat and scorpid. If I remember, I will post what those new numbers are since there seems to be a lot of concern about it (but I don't have them in front of me).

Hunter changes in 3.0.8<br />
On the actual topic, we are pretty happy with the numbers we can generate for hunters with the changes. However, I will certainly bring up with the team that many hunters have posted (some even after testing) that the nerfs were too severe, especially to BM.

I dont have 450 enchanting on the PTR (only 440), but from what I have heard the mats for the two new enchants<br />
Enchant Bracer - Major Stamina: 4 Greater Cosmic Essence, 4 Dream Shard, 4 Abyss Crystal<br />
Enchant Weapon - Titanguard: 12 Dream Shards<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm a max lvl enchanter and while I Agree that the QQ was a bit much, reducing costs to apply enchants is a very welcome change imo. Greater cosmic essence may reduce in price but dream shard will go up. And hey, there is other sources of money you can have with enchanting, just try to figure them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, next to Tailoring - Enchanting is expensive to level, when comparing it to Jewelcrafting or Leatherworking in example. With Essences being rare,*dusts in less quantities then we we're used to and barely any use for Dream Shards in the actually recipes currently, there is a certain unbalance.</div></div><hr />

Let's say they change to PVP gear to reduce their damage. They may have a reduction in damage dealt to others, but they will also experience a reduction in the amount of damage taken due to their new found resilience. <br />

<br />
Healing has to be balanced such that in a 2v2 situation a 1 dps + 1 healer team can actually kill the healer in an opposing 1 dps + healer team. That means if you meet a full resillience, full deadly geared healer 2 players, only one of whom is a dps spec need to be able to take that person down if they intelligently blow their cooldowns and time their attacks. Give healers much more survivability than that and 2v2 becomes the ridiculous 25 minute mess it was during most of TBC.<br />
<br />
Since the line of balance is so fine and since literally nobody has access to full deadly gear yet it is far far too early to be calling for burst nerfs. What Blizzard are addressing is the survivability and high DPS combo of DKs and Ret Palas in PvP with both bubble and IBF/BS taking pretty hefty nerfs in PvP.<br />
<br />
If you look at those two specs in particular they are the combos that are most likely to lose effectiveness once healer survivability increases. Since neither can provide a healing debuff a healer will very quickly get back to full health as soon as he comes out the far side of the damage burst. The worst thing that could happen would be a bunch of knee-jerk nerfs to burst DPS for what could well turn out to have been a non-issue once people get geared up in deadly gladiator gear.</div></div><hr />

Technically the money doesn't &quot;sink&quot; anywhere.. besides AH costs and the opportunity cost of DE'ing a green/blue vs selling it to a vendor, the gold still stays on the server.

But if u have max resilience (u will lose 8-9.5k instead) and have 30% more hp (25-26k hp), it mean that u will lose only around 30-40%, and that is like u have taken 50% less damage. (the numbers i have taken are only example)<br />
<br />
So stop complaining about burst until u have full PVP gear.<br />
<br />
BTW remember how it was when TBC come out. I could 2 shot kill player with my mage easy. Rogue could kill any cloth with ambush backstab evis, and afli lock only had to put dots on every1 and just walk a way from them. But when all got PvP gear, every mage changed spec to frost instead of arcane/fire, most rogues to Combat, warlocks to demo, etc. So we will be able to talk about burst only after all get PvP gear, cos right now every1 have PvE gear (high damage low hp and resilience).</div></div><hr />

You want Blizzard to make up for you being an idiot? The game doesn't work that way. Want to know how I level enchanting? I stand there spamming my enchantment link until people bring me mats and pay me to do the enchants I need to level with. Apparently that was to hard for you. That is not Blizzards fault. Enchanting is not that hard to level when you consider a great deal of the enchants that you can do early on are ones that people are actually willing to get off of you. Its just not as easy as it was in TBC where you burn the oils for most of your skill points.</div></div><hr />

A fully geared tank, a fully geared dps, and a decently geared healer that know their stuff will actually be able to three man heroics. Its already starting to happen. They can still clear the heroics in about 45 minutes. Go to a heroic with 5 bosses and that is 5 bosses and a crystal. If you consider that shards sell for 25g and the crystals sell for 250 (after they drop they are currently much higher) then you are looking at 475 gold in 45 minutes just three manning a heroic.</div></div><hr />

If you do not suck at running heroics, the shards and crystals are much easier to get than having to farm out greens for a chance at lesser mats. All these changes mean is that the enchanters that run instances will make more money than some scrub that can farm greens on his/her main to send to his/her dk enchanter that went to 375 after gaining two levels. I am absolutely in favor of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
thats bullshit, you dont have to farm green items to get essences, but my point is different - skilling up enchanting was very expensive, but ok, i did spend the gold for it and now i want to earn money from my investments, but what happens? Blizzard just f*cks with us(by us i mean ppl who actually spend their gold in enchanting)... and now kids can get skills for like half or less of the original price...</div></div><hr />

Powerleveling enchanting past ring enchants was pretty much for server first bullshit anyway. Currently sitting at 435 enchanting with 100 shards to burn and wondering how I can pull more essences out of thin air. At least I can spend the shards on leveling up now.</div></div><hr />

In point of fact, the more people playing the AH economic mini-game, the more effective a money sink it becomes. It doesn't matter how much profit any one individual manages to make, every time they reinvest that gold into another round of buy low/sell high another 5/10 (depending on if they buy direct or buy out low bid auctions to resell or craft/have crafted then resell) percent is whisked away. 10% off players turning over 5k g daily is most certainly non-negligible. <br />
<br />
Regardless, as I said it was probably intended as much as an artificial obstacle to slow early progress. People who wanted the skill, or the enchants, or in the case of JC the crafted items early paid a premium. Nature of the game. Heck even the server first 450 chefs had to pay top gold to get that far, and deal with the same sort of artificial obstacle in the form of the northrend spice.<br />

i don't know if they have any scheming of that sort in this case, but i wouldn't put it past them. mounts are a nice example of a sink in this game. they cost substantially more than a reasonable amount for the given level, yet they're a necessity. it's kind of brutal, but there are other MMOs which don't have any good sinks and inflation screws the shit out of their economy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues are OP. Rogues are imbalanced. There is only one way to fix rogues. Remove them. Since that wont happen, take being stunlocked and faceraped (especially we clothies, you at least wear mail.) like the rest of us.<br />
<br />
As a priest, I can pop my trinket, fear, and dot the rogue up, pop painsupression when they come back.<br />
<br />
Use Shamanistic Rage and Stoneskin maybe? I don't know<br />
<br />
Also, get a nice, beefy two hander. A two hander windfury crit will take down a leather wearer quite a bit.<br />
<br />
Also, as for the enchants, The reduction in price is mostly because a lot of enchants will now be using dream shards instead of dreamshards being used mostly as currency for the enchanters to buy new enchants. Atleast I know ill be able to two 7 more spellpwoer onto my bracers as soon as the patch hits =D.<br />
<br />
For me, leveling my enchanting honestly wasn't expensive at all. I leveled up a HUGE portion of my enchanting just by disenchanting all the random drops and quest rewards (considering I was rocking tier 6 leveling up and didn't need any of the rewards). It got me a ton of mats. There was a point between 420-440 where it slowed down a lot. Unlike a lot of people who went out buying mats to level their enchanting, I mostly just advertised on trade chat and enchanted my guildies' gear as they leveled. Now I'm rocking 456 (I'm a bloodelf) with minimal effort, and minimal money invested.<br />
<br />
Tailoring... that was a different story all together.</div></div><hr />
