It looks like the Patch 6.0 PTR might be coming soon! Be sure to check out our preview of the changes to Blasted Lands (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4142-Blasted-Lands-Quests-and-Orgrimmar-Changes-Blue-Posts-Connected-Realms-Dark-Below) and this UBRS video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swzNE9-3TAI).<br />

<br />
Get ready for first contact with the Iron Horde—oh, and you’ll probably want to prepare yourself for battle. Over the next few weeks, we’ll be testing a pre-expansion patch that will bring players to the brink of great peril, as the Iron Horde begins to aggressively gain a foothold on Azeroth.<br />
<br />
As part of this patch, players will encounter fierce new opponents and get their first chance to experience a number of updates we’re making to the game. In addition to changes to the skills and abilities for every class, this patch will introduce brand new features such as 20-player Mythic-difficulty Siege of Orgrimmar, as well as systems adjustments including stat squish and diminishing returns on crowd control. The next chapter in the World of Warcraft saga is coming at you armed to the teeth.<br />
<br />
Treacherous Developments<br />
The Dark Portal in the Blasted Lands has turned blood red. Hundreds of strange-looking orcs are violently pouring into Azeroth, killing everything that stands in their path. Nethergarde and Okril’lon have already fallen, and while the Horde and the Alliance moved as quickly as they could to get reinforcements to their people, they are too late. The Iron Horde invasion has begun. <br />
<br />
In this desperate hour, King Wrynn and Warchief Vol’jin have called upon their greatest champions to join the front lines in the Blasted Lands and do whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde . . . before the rest of Azeroth falls before them.<br />
<br />
Word of this surprise attack sends players rushing to the Blasted Lands to reckon with the barbarous infiltration. After the fall of a high ranking Iron Horde general named Gar’mak Bladetwist, you’ll report what you’ve witnessed in the Blasted Lands to King Wrynn or Warchief Vol’jin. It’s apparent to both the Horde and the Alliance that this is only the first salvo in a much larger conflict, and the only way to win is to take the fight directly to the Iron Horde . . . by journeying through the Dark Portal into Draenor.<br />
<br />
The Infiltration of Blackrock Spire<br />
An advance party of Iron Horde forces has barged right out of the Blasted Lands and pushed all the way to Blackrock Mountain, where they found refuge and supplies in Upper Blackrock Spire. There can be only one response: the Alliance and the Horde of Azeroth must face this iron incursion head on.<br />
<br />
Available to level-90 characters for a limited time, this specially revamped five-player version of Upper Blackrock Spire sets the stage for the coming counterstrike against the Iron Horde. Here, you will face Orebender Gor'ashan, Kyrak, and Commander Tharbek as you begin to take the fight to the enemy and sharpen the skills (and swords) you’ll need to succeed on an unwelcoming alien world.<br />
<br />
Draenor is waiting.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because they're totally not doing it to test it in order to release it and let it be on live for a while before WoD hits, defo not, it's all just to please people that are too stupid to do something else when they're bored.<br />

So far it's just a simple quest chain (probably no more than 20). There are rare elites, but none of them have a loot table yet and they're nowhere near as headache-inducing like the Patch 5.3 commanders were. And the one quest in the chain has a cutscene, but it's rather drab one.<br />
<br />
I guess it'll still be a step up from the absolute fiasco that was the Theramore scenario, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't it usually 2 months after pre-patch the expansion hits? So about a month from now for live?<br />
<br />
As for the PTR I've no idea, they said there wasn't much that needed to actually be &quot;tested&quot; when questioned about it earlier so I assume it won't be up there for very long.</div></div><hr />

Nope. At the Shattered Beach Head Maraad is talking to Alliance and Thrall is talking to Horde. I know this because I went to investigate the Horde part. I don't know the full extent of the pre event though. I expect it to be much much more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
King Wrynn and Warchief Vol’jin have called upon their greatest champions to join the front lines in the Blasted Lands and do whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde.<br />
<br />
Then it says <br />
<br />
An advance party of Iron Horde forces has barged right out of the Blasted Lands and pushed all the way to Blackrock Mountain<br />
<br />
If there are 2 armies, Horde and Alliance making a front line battle outside of the portal, how do the iron horder sneak through them and make their way from blasted lands to swamp of sorrows to deadwind pass to duskwood to redridge to burningsteppes to get into Blackrock.<br />
Surely someone in the 2 armies might have noticed and stopped them getting through...</div></div><hr />

its more important to hold off the big army coming through portal than to worry about a bunch of loser orcs trying to take over a land that no one wants.........</div></div><hr />
