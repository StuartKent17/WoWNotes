<br />
Glyphs Hotfix<br />
Due to an error, there were a few glyphs that were unable to be crafted via Inscription, which made them unobtainable. These glyphs are:<br />
<br />
Glyph of the Solstice (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118061-glyph-of-the-solstice) (Druid)<br />
Glyph of Purification (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118064-glyph-of-purification) (Priest)<br />
Glyph of Purify Spirit (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118062-glyph-of-purify-spirit) (Shaman)<br />
Glyph of Flying Fists (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118060-glyph-of-flying-fists) (Monk)<br />
<br />
To make sure players have access to them, we've added them to the Inscription vendors in Stormshield and Warspear. Alliance players can purchase them from Joao Calhandro (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/87063-joao-calhandro), and Horde players can purchase them from Maru'sa (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/87551-marusa).<br />
<br />
Update: We're also working on adding Glyph of Cleanse (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118063-glyph-of-cleanse) (Paladin) and Glyph of Frostbrand Weapon (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/161654-glyph-of-frostbrand-weapon) (Shaman). Glyph of Cleanse will be added to the Inscription vendors like the other glyphs. Glyph of Frostbrand Weapon's item is missing from the game files, so we can't add it to the vendors via hotfix. Instead, it will be automatically taught to all Shaman level 75 or higher.<br />
<br />
Except they aren't there? When will this be live?<br />
It's live already. They'll only be visible to the classes that are able to use them.<br />
<br />
How will I make a ton of bank off people who haven't seen this then? <br />
I should also probably mention that they're Unique and Bind on Pickup, for exactly that reason <br />
<br />
Regarding Glyph of Blackout Kick (http://wowpedia.org/Glyph_of_Blackout_Kick): It will return, but as the glyph is completely missing from game data, it can't be added via hotfix. It'll have to wait for a content patch. Sorry<br />
<br />
Ink traders should be working now!<br />
<br />
<br />
Enveloping Mist Hotfix<br />
We've just pushed live a hotfix that increases the healing done by Enveloping Mist (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/124682-enveloping-mist) by 50%. This most likely won't be added to the hotfix blog until after the weekend, but we wanted to be sure you were aware of it before then, as it's already active.<br />
<br />

Items<br />
Trinkets with primary stats in the proc/use part are always better than any other trinket type for DPS.<br />
Theorycraft and supporting evidence would help. A recent hotfix should have solved this. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/536809541334102016))<br />
Ah I see the change now. 220 -&gt; 147 static stat, no change to the procs? Been afk since that I guess.<br />
Yes, the hotfix fixed the stats (by changing passive amounts) on many Draenor trinkets. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/536810813047070720))<br />
<br />
will the wargames gear ever be made available for transmog? or is the conquest gear (that isn't currently available) the same look?<br />
It will intentionally not be available for transmog. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/536984374512607233))<br />

can the retraining certificate cause a follower to LOSE bodyguard? I would love to retrain on of my bodyguards, but I'm afraid to.<br />

<br />
PvP<br />
How come you can't join a friends server in Ashran? This would help with the imbalanced servers, if you could just fix it yourself<br />
it could also (and most likely would) make it worse. We might enable it when we're happier with faction balance. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/537015672199327744))<br />

Yes, those other games are younger, or less accessible, or not marketed well, or have off-putting business models, or any number of factors not related to wealth of cosmetic-customization options. Did you have a point somewhere?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mountains of choice, and no direction. Extraneous transmog choice leads to a diluted, hodge-podge menagerie of player silhouettes and is not conducive to Blizzard's repeated stance that, at some point, the developer needs to give direction -in this case art direction. <br />
<br />
In actual fact, it's you with the special snowflake syndrome -wanting this, wanting that. Respect the fact that Blizzard's direction -art, style, lore and gameplay -still commands the biggest subscriber base in MMO and does so for more than ten years. Transmog fits into that cohesive design and does so by offering choice but at the same time respecting exclusions like Legendaries that deserve to remain just that, exclusive and Legendary feats from the past.</div></div><hr />

Did you have a point somewhere?<br />
<br />
You completely missed it, is all. But since I'm feeling generous, I'll let you know. <br />
<br />
Those other companies have to make money off those cosmetics in order to stay afloat so they can and will sacrifice their souls to give players exactly what they want, which ironically only serves to make those same games worse off than they would if they maintained hold over their creation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I am happy about the change, but, Uplift needs a buff big time. As it takes time and has Limited time for us to use it, it heals for so little, it is easier and quicker to heal each of your party members individually than with uplift, spending them chi! Bring back the old TFT!</div></div><hr />

Level 100 rares are actual rares, not like the leveling vignettes. You can defeat them over and over again until you get their special drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure I understand what you're asking.<br />
<br />
The mounts are guaranteed drops from them so you have no need to farm them with them being bop. With the exception of Garn the wolf mount which can be sold or traded.<br />
<br />
P.S. I seriously hate poundfist. Spent hours and hours camping him on my Alliance on ARTHAS of all places only to show up right as he died at another spawn point. <br />
<br />
So frustrating, and even more frustrating not having a better idea as to when he spawns. At least you have a little bit more of an idea with some of the other rares.</div></div><hr />

All those rares drop their mounts 100% for everyone that participated in the kill in a group or not except for the black wolf, it's 1 drop that gets rolled for meaning he's the only one that you''l have to bother farming if your not lucky to get the mount on your first kill.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't change the fact that what you &quot;edited&quot; is completely irrelevent. He was talking about the span of time that we call winter, not what winter represents. It can be winter like conditions all year and it still would not be winter all year. So you're still wrong and what he said should not have been edited.</div></div><hr />

That can't be true. I know some people haven't logged off in two weeks, and others are unbelievably lucky, but many of us have yet to see one of these things at all. I myself have been farming Nagrand 4-5 hours a day since launch looking for Nakk and Luk'hok. I have yet to see them. Not even their corpses.</div></div><hr />

So much this. It almost seems like too much effort and a waste of chi to even cast uplift sometimes.</div></div><hr />

Got all 7/7 since like 3 days ago. http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/frostmane/Thenazg%C3%BBl/mount#status=is-collected <br />
This new way of obtaining rare-mounts is just too easy, no fun at all. Basically just wait, have some luck with spawntimes. In like a month every player has all of them. Which makes the mounts not beloved (rare) anymore. I rather see the 1% mount drops return in dungeons/instances.</div></div><hr />
