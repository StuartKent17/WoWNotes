Dungeon Difficulty<br />
I have discussed the dungeon difficulty issue before, so I will just bulletize it here:<br />
Naxx is an entry-level raid.<br />
Many players have seen the encounters before.<br />
Players were allowed to learn the encounters on beta.<br />
<br />
On the topic of hard modes:<br />
I think a lot of players do enjoy the challenges, especially when some kind of badge of honor is involved.<br />
We do realize that vanity items like titles and mounts can only motivate people so far and we do have plans to offer better loot for such accomplishments.<br />
We aren't likely to spend several months of development time on content that less than 5% of players will ever see.<br />
We do understand that groups like a challenge though. Ulduar will be more difficult.<br />
<br />
On dual spec:<br />
The idea is to let you swap glyphs and action bars along with your talents.<br />
It will be trivial to do in town.<br />
You will also be able to do it out of towns, but not as trivially.<br />
We hope to have this done for the next major content patch, but it's a big feature and takes some time. <br />

Tanking in WotLK and healing mechanics changes<br />
<br />
One of the design goals in LK was to make tanking more fun and I daresay a little easier because it could be very challenging. I have tanked and healed A LOT on various classes and I feel pretty confident saying that tanking can be much harder than healing on some fights (on others it is reversed). Challenging the dps classes is harder, but you often see it in the form of berserk timers -- if the dps can't maximize their output, then the raid is going to wipe at no fault of the healers. Repositioning fights often tax the dps characters, though to be fair, they often tax the healers too.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty happy with the current state of tanking, modulo polishing up a few bits here and there. Healing is something we have committed to taking a good hard look at now, so threads like this are helpful. Unlike tanking, it is a harder problem to solve, in part because some healers like the way healing works now just fine thank you, and risk walking away from it if we make very dramatic changes. The kinds of dramatic changes that get suggested a lot are things like causing damage to heal, having to heal through the main game window and not the health bars, having combo points and that sort of thing. You may say &quot;That sounds awesome!&quot; but many other players say &quot;Yech.&quot;<br />
<br />
Others say just having better UI, having more diverse spells to rely on, not having to time things so tightly, or having something to do besides healing will make their game more fun.<br />
<br />
We do think the game can handle more diversity in healing mechanics than it can in tanking mechanics. In other words, it's okay for healers to have niches moreso than the tanks. This is largely because raids require more healers than tanks. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13129888099-healer-design-philosophy--why-we-qq.html))<br />
<br />
AoE Healing Nerf<br />
I feel the need to post here in the hopes of alleviating player confusion. The first FAQ was a link to my quotes attempting to explain our concerns about Circle of Healing and Wild Growth. This FAQ by contrast is written from a player POV that this is a shaman issue. It isn't in our minds.<br />
<br />
We looked at the three main AE heals and found that CoH and WG were being used too much in too many different situations and making AE healing too easy. CH is supposed to be used in more situations, because the shaman arsenal is smaller. It isn't as easy to use as CoH and WG. Shamans are still casting other spells.<br />
<br />
Of course we realize not every Holy priest is spamming CoH. That's good -- you all will notice less of a difference after the change.<br />
<br />
Some encounters will likely be more difficult with this nerf. Malygos phase 1 comes to mind. We are prepared to make encounter changes if necessary.<br />
<br />
We explored several options to nerf CoH and WG and eventually settled on a cooldown. You can use those AEs when needed and then switch to single-target heals to top everyone off.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to keep responding to this thread, because we have plenty on the topic already, but I wanted to offer a clarification. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13275671464-cohwg-faq-take-2-read-before-you-post.html))<br />
<br />
&quot;Smart&quot; Healing<br />
I'm not sure why we need to keep starting threads on the same issue, but since you seem to have trouble finding our thoughts on the issue of smart healing, I will offer them again.<br />
<br />
The old model of targeting a group out of a raid to heal it goes against one of the changes we tried to make for Lich King, which is that the raid structure matters, but the party structure within the raid doesn't. Almost all buff are raid-wide now, so we didn't want raiders to have to structure their groups just around things like Circle of Healing. &quot;Um, can you put the MT and OT in the same group please, so CoH can get them both?&quot; That sort of thing.<br />
<br />
One of the things we wanted to do was give players more flexibility in how they set up their raids. This extends to your UI -- if you like to put the tanks in a separate part of your UI, or organize things by class or functional role instead of group, you can do that without having to worry (so much) about who is in what group.<br />
<br />
We couldn't get rid of the group concept for every spell - Mana Tide is one example. But we have gotten rid of a lot of them.<br />
<br />
We did ask all of the class designers and almost everyone on the WoW team who plays a raiding priest, and to a person they all thought the cooldown was a better solution than removing the smart component of the heal.<br />
<br />
I will say again, if one spell (talented at that) is what makes the difference between you A) having fun, B) being able to heal competitively, or C) being brought to a raid at all, that is a much bigger problem than anything CoH itself does.

We have heard some reports of hunter pets tanking say Nexus, which doesn't have a lot of movement required of the tank. Really though, as others have suggested, the goal is more for them to be able to OT large pulls or group quests. Now pet threat generation (Voidwalkers too) is something we are looking at right now.

Death Knight issues and upcoming changes<br />
Death knights are a cooldown-based class. They can't count on abilities being there and ready to the same extent other classes are. In return though, they have an unlimited resource that neither goes away over time (mana) or is dependent on doing damage or taking damage (rage). While a DK may struggle a little more when things get out of control (because of cooldowns) they are also fantastic in other situations -- you can actually battle rez a fallen DK tank and have them get back in the fray because they don't need to build up rage or mana first.<br />
<br />
The rune system definitely has some strengths and weaknesses and that is by design so that the DK actually feels like a different class using different mechanics. Cooldowns won't appeal to everyone, just as drinking to restore mana doesn't appeal to everyone.<br />
<br />
Now, that said, we do hope to be able to post some more definitive changes to DKs soon (putting numbers on the rune strike nerf and all that) and one of the things that comes up a lot is removing the cooldown from Pestilence. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13275619113-dk-tanking-issues-constructive.html))<br />

Chain Heal<br />
We don't think Chain Heal needs a nerf at the current time.<br />
<br />
Unlike CoH (and to a lesser extent WG) it isn't used to the exclusion of other shaman healing spells. It also has some pretty severe drawbacks compared to CoH -- cast time for one.<br />
<br />
But if after we add a cooldown to CoH and WG, we find that CH is making AE healing too trivial or if we find that shamans are being invited to heal raids at the expense of priests and druids, then we will absolutely nerf CH too.

They said from the start that Naxxramas was an entry level raid dungeon. Yet people cry it's too easy.<br />
Circle of Healing and now Wild Growth made raid healing a breeze, I agree with the cooldown. People cry about that too.<br />
Ulduar will probably be challenging enough, but they want players to defeat their content, not bang their head against a wall or their desk.</div></div><hr />

How could they know that 95% of the raiding community would be to incompetent to kill Illidan Stomrage over a 10 month period? And thus wouldn't be able to continue in Sunwell Plateau, since it did require the previous skills plus a little more -- a challenge for the competent players.<br />
<br />
Brutallus was never a gear check, M'uru was. And Kil'jaeden was a far more worthy expansion finisher than Illidan Stormrage ever could have hoped to become.<br />
<br />
So is this the new path? To design dungeons so easily that everybody will get to see them, even it means the top 10000 players (aka. the players who cleared Sunwell Plateau before 3.0) will clear the said dungeons within the first week of release ?<br />

Not for everybody. But also not for only 5 out of 100, who pay 13€ a month. Whats so difficult to understand about it? oO<br />
<br />
I'm sure that even today - one month after release - not even 25% of the wow players either defeated saphiron or malygos.<br />
<br />
Just because some 24/7 &quot;professionals&quot; have beaten this game after a few days doesn't mean it's easy as sleeping.</div></div><hr />

As for the warlock change's tbf I don't care about my pets tanking abilities just fix the rest of us before worrying about the pets, heck VW can do fine against 5man group quest's, Already did all the 5man group quest's in icecrown by two manning them - Warlock and Priest with VW tanking :S</div></div><hr />

all bosses in SWP were beaten pretty rapidly by top guilds anyway. only thing that was stonewalling them were gates, which opened after certain ammount of weeks. in fact, raiding progress was alot slower when guild were competing about vashj and kael firsts, those dungeons took more time to clear. BT was joke for those guilds, mother, council and illidan, all were killed in 3 days. there are no more cockblocks like old 4h were, get over it.<br />
<br />
also, if you didnt read carefully, GC stated they are still going to make &quot;hard mode&quot; encounters. i would certainly like to see, how u managed to beat up sartharion with all drakes alive, . if you didnt, then stop QQing and try to do it. and when you manage it, do it in 10man version. and then show us some actual proof that you did it, and THEN you can come and say &quot;everything is easy&quot;.</div></div><hr />

No, they introduced the 10mans for folks that don't want to interact/guild with more than 9-14 other people. Not saying it's a good idea but really that's the theme they're running with and not a 10man = &quot;scrub&quot;-mode.</div></div><hr />

That said though, this is going to make Malygos tons different. Raids will either need to stack priests so that they can &quot;chain&quot; CoH one after another or more likely most priests will just go disc or shadow, resto druids will go back to lolbloom rolling hots.<br />

The hardcore players had their challange when new content came. It was incredibly hard for decent raid guilds and impossible for casuals. 1-2 month later comes the nerf bat and it is only a challange now for decent guilds and hard but not impossible for the casuals. The hardcore players were through with that instance anyway. They just cried because they felt their achievement was also nerfed - they circle of people who had beaten that boss became less exclusive over time.<br />

What if they feel that after the CH gets the nerf CoH is looking too good again so they nerf it again but then CH is OP now as compared to CoH so it gets another nerf, etc... until what we have is a bunch of different classes stopping and bandaging each other because the two healing classes are no longer raid viable and everyone respecs enhancement and shadow respectively.</div></div><hr />

Lokholar89, I couldn't agree with you more. Almost all of my guild is 2nd and 3rd shift people. We like the challenge of raiding. We don't like the challenge of guild drama. 10mans allow us to play together the way we want to play with people we like to play with, instead of requiring us to play nice with people we don't like just so we can do something other than 5mans until we're blue in the face.</div></div><hr />

I have never ever seen a resto shaman in a raid or 5-man have chain heal account for anything less than 80% of their healing. Why would they nerf something they gave retard healers to placate them because they don't know how to heal otherwise. <br />
<br />
<br />
have u even raid at 80 yet? there are fights, where CH is still superior to all other spells, but there alot of situations, where &quot;LHW build&quot; and whole combination of riptide/LHW is far superior to chainheal. it works both ways, if priest spam mostly CoH, he is called noob, same goes for shaman and CH.</div></div><hr />

In that case the shammies that you have been playing with are insanely inept and should reroll some other class because they're not doing their job properly.<br />
<br />
CH accounts to maybe 50-60% tops of my healing in any given (10-man for example) raid - everything else is Riptide, LHW or HW depending on the situation - there are fights such as Razuvious where CH accounts to below 10% of my overall heals. <br />
<br />
It's called adapting to the situation - CH is great but it's far from being ideal unless you're a scrub healer that can only mindless target someone and spam.</div></div><hr />

I lol'd - at one stage in 10man two of our 3 healers died at the start so we thought we wud give it a go anyways, A pally ( I Sh1t you not ) solo healed thaddius on 10man...<br />
<br />
Well the fact that the raid is termed Heroic and 10man Normal suggests 25man should be a lot more difficult but currently it's not . Suppose it was a good move for blizz to get more people to see the content.... Actually gonna play WC3 series to play while waiting for Ulduar to come out, so I'm spending more money on blizz product's so theres another good thing for them ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aidda</div><div class="date">2008-12-09, 08:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A random player asked me last night : &quot;If you can heal Loken in heroic as paladin without anyone dieying in group, i give you 100 gold&quot; . I said : &quot;O.o ?? are you kidding ? i win 100gold / day like this&quot; . Basicaly, is a bit challanging yes, but can be done, by paladins, without needing AOE healing. Still, i saw priest CoH healing there, and i understood that it was very easy for him. <br />
Healing raid at Malygos, in 10-man, only by a holy priest and a holy paladin ? yes, is also possible and worked fine for us. <br />
The problem that i see still, is that most of my priests wont enjoy at all the nerf to CoH. Currently CoH is a very good way of keeping the raid alive, and be very competitive healer. And if CoH will be nerfed, ill surely take more resto shamans in serious encounters where raid-healing requierement is very high. (a pure example before 3.0 was Twins, Muru) . <br />
<br />
While paladins can show up as very decent healers now, and they can actualy top the healing metters, with the &quot;i judge i win&quot; - aka Judgement of Light, and a good use of Beacon of Light, these are still very low heals, good in metters, very poor in intense raid-healing content. And if they want to nerf CoH, but still do some competitive content where you actualy need to heal more than just afk-healing in Naxx, they should consider that holy priests need to have a decent role in raid composition. <br />
<br />
Im a paladin, i do not want an aoe healing in my spells, but im also against nerfing CoH so that priests wont use it any more, or will use it every now and then. At a certain point, there should be enough differences between healers, in their way of healing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AetherMcLoud</div><div class="date">2008-12-09, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Others say just having better UI, having more diverse spells to rely on, not having to time things so tightly, or having something to do besides healing will make their game more fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not a full time healer (not anymore) but I do enjoy speccing healing for a weekend and healing in general, not just all the time. Not being able to do anything besides instances is one thing that (they changed that for tanks, and to some extend for healers, but still questing as disc is no comparison to shadow), and not seeing most of the (really well designed) instances is another. I've seen it this weekend when I went from shadow to holy (to disc after one instance because I hated holy right from the spot, more on that later :D) so our shaman healer could try out elemental for once. <br />
<br />
It has gotten better because I changed my UI, to have the party and target health bars much closer to my avatar ingame, so I atleast can see what is going on around me while watching the party. But still I didn't really have the time to enjoy the instance. Healing hero nexus is exactly the same as healing hero violet hold. You don't see much of the surrounding, all you see most of the time are health bars. When we started our first 25man raid yesterday (only did 10 mans before) I really pitied our healers. I, as a shadow, still had grid with 25 mans displayed, but having to watch only 25 bars going up and down while we dps and tanks see the awesomeness of Naxx is... well... pityful.<br />
<br />
Also probably the single one thing that made healing more fun for me is Penance. With holy, healing stuff is basically: You have a spell animation, target's feet have a circle drawn around them, target gets healed. <br />
<br />
But with Penance, it's more like JIMMY IMA CHARGIN MA FIREBALL healing. Call me childish, a noob, or whatever you want, but I actually enjoy getting visual feedback from what I do. If I wanted to play whack-a-healthbar without any graphic effects I'd play a MUD. Prayer of Mending also falls into this category, it's very visual, and dare I say fun. It jumps around, it makes a sound every time, and is generally a good spell. Greater Heal on the otherside is probably the least fun and uncreative spell when it comes to visuals. Spell animation, circle around targets feet, as I said. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How could they know that 95% of the raiding community would be to incompetent to kill Illidan Stomrage over a 10 month period? And thus wouldn't be able to continue in Sunwell Plateau, since it did require the previous skills plus a little more -- a challenge for the competent players.<br />
<br />
Brutallus was never a gear check, M'uru was. And Kil'jaeden was a far more worthy expansion finisher than Illidan Stormrage ever could have hoped to become.<br />
<br />
So is this the new path? To design dungeons so easily that everybody will get to see them, even it means the top 10000 players (aka. the players who cleared Sunwell Plateau before 3.0) will clear the said dungeons within the first week of release ?<br />
<br />
Is challenge only a option for those in poor gear and with no skills ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Why should you have to be in a over the top raiding guild, which hones their skills every day, to be able to see content? I have work and other things to do in RL besides thinking about raiding (no offence, I am not implying you don't), and I simply don't have either the time nor the desire to raid 6 days a week.<br />
<br />
Why should I be excluded from seeing that content? Because I am a so-called &quot;casual&quot; raider? What makes me &quot;casual&quot;? I still take the very best spec for my role in raiding, I eat the best available bufffood, I am flasked in every raid, I work hard to do the best dps I can. Why should I not be able to see content simply because I don't have the time to raid more... &quot;hardcore&quot;?<br />
<br />
I find the design that blizzard is doing now really neat. Everybody can see the content, and as they said Naxx is supposed to be entry level, just, or even more so than, Karazhan was. Malygos isn't quite as easy as Naxx for example.<br />
<br />
There are achievements like doing all of naxx with 9 man, having noone die on a full clear, and what-have-you. Some of those like the non-dying one give you at title to boast. And the blue post here said they will also add item rewards for some of the harder achievements. I like that. If you're a top-notch raiding guild you can and will do those (like Sapphiron with all 3 drakes up) and get rewarded for it. If you're in a more casually raiding guild, you can still see the content and enjoy it.<br />
<br />
New Naxx was my first encounter with the instance (raided MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20 at 60) and it is freaking awesome. The boss fights are each really nice designed with very fun ideas. It was absolutely the right choice to use Naxx as an entry level raid IMHO, because it is just, to quote TotalBiscuit, the best designed instance ever. I really love Naxx :D<br />

<br />
I'm sure that even today - one month after release - not even 25% of the wow players either defeated saphiron or malygos.<br />
<br />
Just because some 24/7 &quot;professionals&quot; have beaten this game after a few days doesn't mean it's easy as sleeping.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why can't there be easy, medium and hard instances in the same game all at the same time?<br />
Why can't they let the really dedicated players work on hard bosses while the &quot;casual&quot; players stay<br />
in the lower instances? Everyone wins, where is the problem?<br />
<br />
Is it because poeple who can't beat the hard instances, for whatever reason, feel they should be there too, and are too jealous to be satisfied with the lower duengoens? I guess that must be the reason. And since Blizzard is too lazy and don't want to spend some of all the money they make each month, they only try to satisfy the majority of the people. <br />
<br />
The raiding part of this game is finished, believe me. It will never return to the former glory. Sure, Ulduar WILL be harder of course. But only because nothing can be easier than Naxxramas. They will add a few silly achievements and call it end game. But the worst thing about all of this, is that some people will even applaud them and defend their decision.</div></div><hr />

Jelously? Let me comment on that with a big fat LOL. I couldn't care less about worldfirsts, serverfirsts, and whatnot. I give a literal fuck about progression. All I want to be able to, is seeing the new content. Because if you cannot see it, what is the point of new content? What is the point of big fat patches with new instances (like the old naxx, or sunwell upon release) if only 5% of the playerbase will ever see it?<br />
<br />
As I said before, Naxx is a freakingly well designed instance and I am glad Blizzard tried to let me see it, because I and 95% of the other players couldn't at level 60.<br />
<br />
So don't dare call that jelousy. If you still do, I will call you an elitist jerk who just doesn't want 95% of the so-called &quot;lesser raiders&quot; to enjoy what he could enjoy.</div></div><hr />

Your comment is completely valid and I can totally see where you are coming from...<br />
<br />
The question is now for us who like to progress and have &quot;harder&quot; encounters is why is it fair for us to be finished the games current content in a week? So do we now have to wait for the other 95% to see the end boss of naxx or whatever for the next part of the content to be released?<br />
<br />
Like tbc even the frequent raiders took quite a while to clear from Kara to Last bosses in TK SSC bar the few top end guilds will will raid more than four five hours a nite. A lot of people did eventually see Kara + Gruul + Maggy + SSC + TK ofc BT+MH+SWP there was significantly less but if you look at each and every server after the nerfs hit there was a lot of casual guilds did clear content unimaginable to them pre nerf... So in TBC the hard content did work to an extent because they eventually nerfed it, probably a lot later than sooner. Tbf I can't see why they don't just do this again, Keep content hard for a given time. The so called casuals will still see the content over a longer time period but isn't that why they are termed casual because they don't have the time to do content fast because they have other commitments. <br />

<br />
When your guild can clear all content on one evening, then you got 6 days off. It's the casual guilds who end up raiding most because their lack of skill make them wipe over and over again.<br />
<br />
Take a guild like Ensidia, the players there play alot less than most &quot;casual&quot; raiders, because they can logoff for 3 months after doing a 7 day rush.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and make the 25mans with scaling difficulty up to being as hard as SWP was...<br />
<br />
Ugh, because gearing up 25 people through 10 man raids so you can do the raids you want to do is a pain in the ass. You've either got to run three raids and have 5 people benched for 'real' raids, or you've got to run two raids and carry 5 people - doubling or tripling your organisation alone. Plus factor in the &quot;b team&quot; drama it causes if the balance of skill isn't perfect and one of those raids takes longer to clear the instance.<br />
It's just poor structure because 25 is not a factor of 10.<br />
<br />
Trivial 10 mans are wasted content as much as hard 40s were. Casuals have fun without ever being challenged to improve; people who enjoy raiding with their 9 mates don't have fun because it's not challenging; raiding guilds never go there because walking through an instance for shards isn't fun.<br />
<br />
10/25s as parallel progression is a great idea - they just need to balance the &quot;this is your hard mode now&quot; achievements with actual rewards raiders care about. I'm considerably ho-hum about adding yet another flying mount to my burgeoning collection (especially since you can't show them off in the main city - great design!), but I wouldn't mind some exclusive heirloom items, unlockable shattrath-style flask vendor, or even an extra set piece.</div></div><hr />

This is the best idea ever.<br />
<br />
Instead of complaining about how CoH considerably outshines CH despite Shaman supposedly being designed as aoe-niche healers and having limited healing options due to that, we can simply supplant Paladins as the supreme single-target healers thanks to permanently hasted Healing Waves and an utterly worthless raid-heal. <br />
<br />
Since Paladins will need compensating for losing their niche, why don't we take the cooldown off their hearthstones so they can get out of the raid quickly when another class logs on? :'(</div></div><hr />

Why do you need to see the hard content, if you are not finished with the medium content first? The medium content, in your case, is still new content. So you have things to work on, bosses to beat and items to get. And while you do that, let other people have fun in the harder instances. <br />
<br />
If you just want to see the hardest instances, wait until they get nerfed before the next expansion. But this cannot be the reason for it. You want the same as the dedicated players, but you don't want to invest the same as they do. <br />
<br />
Naxxramas: I don't mind that Naxxramas is an easy instance. Not at all, I´m glad you enjoy it. But where is the next raiding tier content, for those who are done with it? It comes with the next content patch. Great, no one knows when this will be.<br />
<br />
So after months of working on the expansion, Blizzard comes up with a recycled entry-level expansion and 3 Onyxia style bosses and that's it for the raiders?<br />
They expect me to buy the expansion, and then pay $13 a month while I wait for raid content that suits my style? DOn't you think that this is a freaking joke?<br />

Yes, but currently you can clear the content in 1 day.<br />
<br />
At TBC Launch we had 21 (8+2+1+6+4) bosses to kill. Today we got 17 (15+1+1). (And I counted Opera as 1 boss, and ignored the Chess Event.)<br />
<br />
The difference between the bosses was much larger, and the stategy for these were hardly known. While we known Naxx stategies to learn the encounters to perfection before ever reaching level 80.<br />
<br />
Malygos was a really good encounter, new and exiciting. P2 sucked, but allright way of testing the raid coordination Onyxia style :-)<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how fast top 1-10 clears it, it's more important how top 10-200 clears it. For Kil'jaeden, the average learning time was 1-2 raiding weeks for that single encounter, ie. 6-8 raid evenings.<br />
<br />
And that's allright, you feel a accomplishment of doing it. <br />
<br />
Currently the &quot;hardcore&quot; guilds clear the content Wednesday evening, and then logoff for the rest of the week, while the casual guilds clears 1/3 of the content on 2-3 evenings.<br />
<br />
Yet they keep saying the &quot;hardcores&quot; are nolifers who never log off and waste their entire life in front of their PC.<br />
<br />
I also see &quot;hardcore&quot; guild have a much stronger team system. How much guilds would wipe 9 times on Malygos so everybody in the raid could get Denyin' the Scion achievement for the Proto Drake? Most casuals would just get it over as fast as possible, when they finally were able to kill the boss.<br />
<br />
Also when I was in Paris I meet a officer from Loot FTW and a hunter from Method. We had beers, chatted about non-wow stuff, etc. at the friday WWI meeting (/wave).<br />
<br />
Yeah sure, hardcore guild is nolifers who live in a basement...</div></div><hr />

I'll be happy to compare my /played to any of the Ensidia players - no, I never cleared SWP but I did go up to BT a month after them - being part of the &quot;casual guild&quot; as you call it and I would be willing to be a sizeable sum of money my average is way below any of them.</div></div><hr />

And please remember, this is over a period of 4 years.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AetherMcLoud</div><div class="date">2008-12-10, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently the &quot;hardcore&quot; guilds clear the content Wednesday evening, and then logoff for the rest of the week, while the casual guilds clears 1/3 of the content on 2-3 evenings.<br />

<br />
Hmm I guess that makes me hardcore, although I consider myself and my guild as a bunch of casuals :D<br />
<br />
We are clearing all of naxx in one evening too. The rest of the week it's heroics to outfit twinks and the one guy we have with a baby (so he doesn't really get to raid much) and questing/pvping.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nezoia</div><div class="date">2008-12-10, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the amount you raid is pretty much equal to the so called &quot;hardcore&quot; guilds.<br />
Perhaps it's about time to realise the description is wrong.<br />
<br />
There's 10 guilds worldwide who'll compete about the World First of certain boss kills or achievement. Then there's 200-300 guilds who'll do it within the following weeks.<br />
<br />
And then there's the rest, who might do it within a half year, or cry aobut it's to hard untill it gets nerfed just before a new expansion. And then still wipe 10 times before killing it.</div></div><hr />
