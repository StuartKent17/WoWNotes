Not a world first kill, but technically they're the first guild to kill her without any bugs on her HP.<br />
Loots not available yet. Feel free to annoy them on #wow.method on quakenet to get them !<br />
You can also visit their Website (http://smiler.se/method/portal/)<br />

Maybe the GM was a little overburdened by this, but as there is proof that they earned their loot, they should receive it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-05-05, 10:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They went through tons of GMs already ^^<br />
<br />
They'll probably get the loot in a few hours, they frapsed the kill with 2 PoV anyway, it's not like it will be hard to prove that hey killed her.</div></div><hr />

I hope the players of Method are able to get their loot after the developers test the encounter (like they should have done already before they tried to sell this unfinished product).<br />
Seriously, the excuse of &quot;this sort of thing is to be expected in an MMO&quot; is simply pathetic. There is no justifiable reason why such important content is so embarrasingly flawed, yet released with no warning or compensation other than &quot;sorry&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Or even my week, i don't no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, of course. I'm pretty sure that GMs aren't allowed to hand out loot this easily, so it's not really his/ her fault.</div></div><hr />
