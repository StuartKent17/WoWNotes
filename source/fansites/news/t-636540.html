10-15 minutes for a single 'character retrieving list' and then just start it all over again since the server disconnects on every try due the timeout on loggin in. kinda confusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if you could stay logged in for more then a few minutes at a time, there was so much server lag it was taking 15-30 seconds for a single Talent point to be spent.<br />
<br />
Those who were able to get set and in raids &quot;from what I saw/heard&quot; tried to zone in, got the Ulduar loading screen, then were booted back outside.<br />
<br />
That, and world server crashes every 15-20 minutes.<br />
<br />
How are they testing this again?<br />
<br />
It won't drop blues on live. Jesus people think. It's a 10 man raid. <br />
<br />
Besides that, Hodir fight looks easy.</div></div><hr />

Yep. Been trying to log in non stop for about 45mins. No doubt my raid group has dispanded by now :/ <br />

Protip: That's not Loken's model. Yes, the other Thorim was a placeholder. Why you'd want them to recycle an old frost vrykul model for a boss in a raid instance, I will never know.<br />

maybe they'll help in the end-fight. i mean the longer WoW lasts, the less really &quot;mortal&quot; evil-doers we will face, so the more we need help by others (see bosses from illidan on)</div></div><hr />

Who the f*** cares? It's test-server - for testing purposes - so it will probably get buffed/changed. If anyone actually cares about wether they are considered &quot;world first killers&quot; on a test-server, they are seriously grasping for straws trying to get some aknowledgement. In other words, pretty damn sad.</div></div><hr />

Yea it seems likely we will also redeem Mimiron and Freya and in the end get help from all 4 Watchers against Yogg-Saron. Course I wonder what happened to Watcher Tyr still. Guess he could just the one Watcher who didn't get corrupted and we meet him as a normal NPC in the instance.</div></div><hr />

Ah. That one is probably only from Thorim... Since just looking at the top 10 from the one I linked it's obvious it is more HP than he has. ;D Unless there are a lot of adds to kill.</div></div><hr />

If you looked at the raid frames, you would have seen the tab that says &quot;Grid&quot;, right in your face. Raid frames are Grid.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
12.5 mil hp? o_O<br />
sheesh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering the other boss they tested had 35 million, it seems really low. o.O<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
The top 10 in this screen shot (http://img141.imageshack.us/img141/9941/wowscrnshot022709211506.jpg) total ~11.6 million damage. Unless the other 15 were practically AFK or it was an AOE fight, that's gotta be overall damage.<br />
<br />
OTOH, if it was an AOE fight, maybe we're seeing Blizz's prediction that SPriests are the new kings of AOE with mind sear come true. Seeing as the Hodir boss had 35 million, almost 3x as much HP, that seems quite likely.<br />
<br />
The mage said he was OOM in the private channel, there's no way a mage would go OOM on a 12mill HP boss with 4k DPSers unless he had to spam AOE during it, that's a 3 minute fight assuming 15 DPSers.</div></div><hr />

Since just looking at the top 10 from the one I linked it's obvious it is more HP than he has. ;D Unless there are a lot of adds to kill.<br />
<br />
I caught the tail end of an attempt on that video linked to this post and it looked like a gauntlet of mobs from the first room (here (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/thorim.jpg)) to Thorim's room (here (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/february/thorimmethod.jpg)), while strafing left -&gt; right (similar to Skadi the Ruthless in UP). Like I said I caught the end, so some of that could be wrong but there are indeed adds to kill.<br />
<br />
@stupid11<br />
On the gauntlet in the hall in front of Thorim I noticed on one stream that a mage was casting blizzard, so aoe heavy wooo :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
but u had to split the raid, some people had to stay in the arena. Many adds jumping from the wall, they use silence and stuns.<br />
The other people had to go through a tunnel with adds on the left side, where a huge golem stands at the end. So recount don't detect damage which is dealed about 200yards range. Sry for my bad English :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I liked the other Thorim. I just got confused when I saw the screenshot, I first thought they had pulled a Kael'thas on Loken and then I thought they were using that model as placeholder for another, unique model for Thorim. =P<br />
<br />
<br />
Touche, I couldn't see it very well on the stream.<br />
<br />
That indeed was Loken, but I'm sure the new model was just NYI for that PTR push. Would make sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this game is so easy so nerds can get achievement mounts and park it in dalaran FP... NOW all the nerds are happy...<br />
<br />
sorry to bash on u losers like that but something needs to be done fast because i dont think any of the guilds should have been able to roll into ptr and beat the bosses that fast... Good going blizz atleast u made all the losers actually feel like they have accomplish something in there life by making content so easy...<br />
<br />
i bet some loser already printed a screen shot of them standing over a dead ptr boss and made a poster out of it and now cant sleep at all because he is staring at it all night long....<br />
<br />
incase u couldnt figure out why blizz made this game so easy is because they got sick of players crying all the time... happy now ride ur stupid achievement mounts because of all u players u just ruin this game...<br />
<br />
if i made a spelling error am sure some loser that cant get laid will point it out ... love u spell checkers u just save me money from buying the new verision of microsoft word</div></div><hr />

None of the boss fights encountered are the hard mode versions. If the NORMAL MODE versions, which is the CURRENT version they are TESTING...REPEAT...NORMAL MODE IS THE CURRENT VERSION THEY ARE TESTING, was a huge challenge for these guilds, who spend the majority of their waking hours in life raiding, and are very good at it, then Blizzard has just pulled a vanilla Naxx 3.0.<br />
<br />
Wait for the achievements. The HARD MODE achievements. When those launch, you may start your bitching if shit gets cleared. Oh wait, you CAN'T. Cause it's the FUCKING PTR. These fights are NOT TUNED.<br />
<br />
Want to bitch about challenges and have it mean a damn thing? WAIT FOR LIVE.</div></div><hr />
