I can appreciate that you love and enjoy playing the game and are excited about seeing the patch notes. We're excited about seeing 2.4 get out there, get some testing, and then release with a bunch of great new content. It's just a little while longer. Sit tight, enjoy the weekend.</div></div><hr />
