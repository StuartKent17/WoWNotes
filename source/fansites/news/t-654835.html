<br />
That +hit gear is what's keeping your hit at the minimum for pvp as an alternative to wearing pve gear which has no resil. Notice how most of the regular pvp gear is +crit and only a few pieces carry hit which is never enough. I normally use one piece of WG gear just to keep my hit up and still keep my gladiator set bonus.<br />
<br />
Now that they're moving over to offset stuff it's probably a good idea to switch over your other offsets like neck and cloak to crit and stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't even have enough hit for pvp and just stack crit i lol at you</div></div><hr />

Etched Ring is the only one and the stats are best for a Druid tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking of which, why isn't there a tank ring? It seems like they've gone out of their way to leave tanks out a few times this xpac when it comes to gear - the KT rings always bugged me, and the Algalon quest is also noticably missing any tank option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You could also ask why there is no craftable tank weapon. <br />
I think its because tanks are in need of every little upgrade they can get, so new tanks would be forced more to buy a kirin tor ring. As for dps, having a little weaker ring at the beginning doesnt make that much of a difference.<br />
<br />
Thats the only way i could explain it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If only that etched ring had +hit on it instead of +crit ... or maybe a mitigation stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is that best honor/arena gear always have higher ilvl and there is 3 yellow sockets in there (shoulders, boots, chest) so it is better to just skip WG gear and grab some hit gems instead. This gear will be mostly good for people under 1400 rating.</div></div><hr />

I'll most likely ditch the 2pc 7.5 Frostfire on my Mage for 4pc S7 + the Pants. Will have to test thoroughly though, seeing as I'm losing a lot of Mana (in addition to Blizzard's plan of 'longer Arena fights')</div></div><hr />
