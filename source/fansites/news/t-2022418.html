Legion Beta Build Deploy - 7/5/2016<br />
Hi Friends,<br />
<br />
Beta realms are being brought down for another new build. ETA is 1-3 hours, if it ends up going long I'll provide updates.<br />
<br />
As usual I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience everyone!</div></div><hr />

<br />
cause they have a lots of bugs and unfixed things in beta. never played a beta, that was that unfinished so short before release. so what would i do ? simple: hire a hundreds of thousands of beta testers, and sell em that as a gift :)<br />
<br />
my other option is: they dont stopped copying diablo, and introduced some auto content demon bounties stuff, like bounties in D3. also possible.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure that would help them get ready any faster, though. We're basically reporting bugs just as soon as they're found, so it's really only their bug-fixing team that would be the bottleneck if there is one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one we been hinting at can be done on beta, PTR, or live :)<br />

<br />
as a software developer i have to agree to a great percentage. it often depends. if their bottleneck is finding and collect all bugs fast enough, to not iterate often, and instead bulk-fix it, open beta helps A LOT. but if they cant batch-do the stuff and iterations are rare, and they just have too less menpower in fixing, then you are right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yep. thats shocking me too. something inside me gets ready for a &quot;soooory customers, but we have to delay the release&quot; :) never saw that much unfixed, unpolished stuff so short before pre patch. dont get me wrong, what i see is great. but its just not ready.</div></div><hr />

The PTR client isn't marked as release and the end of the pvp season hasn't been announced. So we are at least a 2 floating week window away from the pre patch until the pvp announcement goes live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i even have no idea how they want do that all ? with demon hunter experience you need at an absolute minimum 4-6 weeks. and you have to anounce 2 weeks before the end of pvp season. so lets say 7-8 weeks. eeehrm, in 7-8 weeks its august 30th ??? they had should anounce the pre oatch last week by this calculation. so i have NO idea how that all should be workin. <br />
<br />
and when i look at the stability and delivery-readyness of beta... omg. <br />

Also about release readiness, I think this is getting to the time where Blizz devs are going to start living on campus and working that overtime.</div></div><hr />

I will say the stability seems to have improved a bit lately. I'm no longer disconnected every 5 minutes or just randomly while flying 78% of the time, etc.</div></div><hr />

That makes no sense. I didn't preorder, I got in. My friends who preordered didn't get in. To be fair, if I was Blizzard and saw you being salty, I'd keep you from having access too.</div></div><hr />

Why do you need 4 to 6 weeks? I will agree the beta is much buggier then normal this late into testing. They certainly don't need a long time for the demon hunter stuff though. Their starting area is rock solid and has been for awhile. It take all of 30 minutes to an hour to finish if the area is jam packed with other people. By the time they are out of there they are at 100. You really don't need anymore prep then that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of progression raiders in top guilds will want to 1) Figure out the quickest leveling path for their artifact to make them viable in raids. 2) Want to figure out how to level as quickly as possible period. 3) Do raid testing to have strats planned out well before the raids drop on live.<br />
<br />
I understand these guilds only comprise of the 1% but my guild among many others are pushing for top US and world so we'll be split raiding. Meaning I need multiple alts as well as my main raid ready as quickly as possible. The more I know about how leveling is going to work and the artifact the quicker I can be ready for the first raid.</div></div><hr />

because it gives people time to learn their classes, get ready, and you do know the pre-event is not just the demon hunters, its a large quest chain, demon hunters, dark whispers, doomsayers, legion invasion, and broken shore....</div></div><hr />

You are over estimating how much there is to demon hunters at the start. I do know exactly what is in the pre event it isn't a lot of content either. If you looked at the post I was replying to they had said just for the demon hunters you need 4 to 6 weeks, I since you asked if i know there are other things I am going to have to ask if you can read the entire post you are about to jump into for no reason.</div></div><hr />

I agree 100% i gave up on all the contests maybe getting in one here or there id just perfect the mig system and or Profs but i agree i dont wanna work aimlessly on a a char thats not my main and doing it allllll over roboic and boring many might be ok with it if your used to doing it over and over alt'ing.</div></div><hr />

DHs are not part of the pre patch, and wont be playable from the beginning of pre patch. Tomorrow will be some stupid little gimmick event not worth being around for either. Less than 2 months till legion launches anyway, beta wont be around too much longer so no big reason to try and get in anymore.</div></div><hr />

Exactly how many betas have you actually played in? The Legion beta is pretty polished at the moment yes it couldn't have launched now but the larger bugs have been fixed and the more minor ones will get dealt with prior to launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;it does not involve changes to the live game&quot; and &quot;community fun&quot;. So I'll tell you what it is: shitty twitter &quot;event&quot; where they'll give away large amounts of beta keys. Awesome :|</div></div><hr />

That's a good point. They have a new instance technology to create new instances if there are too many players at the same place. They probably really need to test it to avoid another WoD opening with the crashes among the insane amount of players.</div></div><hr />

Yes because I'm sure every person on the pre orders would log into the beta, <br />
<br />
And I'm sure all those that do, will treat the beta as it should be, not a demo.<br />
<br />
Ragers logic ...... :D</div></div><hr />

The beta is not ready to go live. Will it be in 8 weeks? Probably. Even if they have to cut crap out and release it later. (or not at all)</div></div><hr />

Just wait a month and play it when it comes out complete.<br />

Having people on the servers is testing the servers. I've been on beta for months and have submitted around 60 bug reports. What data did you use to form the opinion that most don't care about testing? Do you know everyone on the beta servers?</div></div><hr />

They will announce something like: All people who get the achievement &quot;blah blah blah Demon Invasion&quot; in PTR will be entered in a drawing to win one of 5,000 beta keys (accounts flagged automatically). Why? Because not as many people are testing the PTR as they would like.</div></div><hr />

streamers don't have resources to give out 5000 keys, but ptr is a good way to see demons :)</div></div><hr />

Perhaps kill a certain creature go on a scavenger hunt like those pesky eggs from Noblegarden? We'll find out soon I guess.</div></div><hr />

OK... so it's a streamer oriented &quot;event&quot;...<br />
<br />
So... Several streamers will be hosting Live Streams of PTR Demon Invasions. Participate, clear X amounts of invasions and Blizzard flags accounts with BETA.<br />
<br />
Yup... downloading PTR now... :)</div></div><hr />

Sign up for what? Nothing is guaranteed.<br />
<br />
Are you entering contests and then not using keys? That's scummy if you are.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I reckon it's a way to get a load of people on and stress test.</div></div><hr />

No you tool on your battle.net account page there has always been a section saying &quot;If you would like to participate in future beta's check this box&quot; which i did way back in 2008 ish time.</div></div><hr />

I'm typically excited about the idea of getting into beta, it's new and fresh. This time however I would LOVE to get into beta. I had such high hopes for WoD and am terrified Legion will just be another huge disappointment. So for me personally I want to see how it's going and if it's even worth my time.</div></div><hr />

Those who test beta typically are FAR ahead of those who don't when it comes to class/raid preparedness.</div></div><hr />
