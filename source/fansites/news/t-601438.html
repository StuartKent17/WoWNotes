<br />
And here is the timeline, explaining why it's a big, huge, fake.<br />
<br />
00:00 : The human you see is only wearing the tier 4 warrior set and is using two glaves models that have been in game for a lot of time. (Same character (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/warglaive.jpg) in WoWModelViewer)<br />
00:29 : Badly photoshopped logo, it's just the classic logo recolored and with a few ice effects. <br />
00:35 : Wow ... Loading screen ! Hey wait, I think I already saw this one. Undead Campaign Screen (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/northrend_orly.jpg) in Warcraft 3.<br />
00:57 : Orc Warlock in a Tier 6 armor set, nothing new here. <br />
01:02 : A normal character selection screen with a new class ... This is just the Wisp Race icon (http://www.wowwiki.com/Wisp_%28April_Fools%29) used for the Blizzard's april fool joke in 2006.<br />
01:30 : Emerald Dream ... Nothing new, for example if you check this movie (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=18319) you'll see the same thing, and it's one year old. It will probably be related to Northrend but it's not leaked from the expansion, just from current game files. <br />
02:34 : Northrend on world map, look like a stretched version of this fan map (http://www.wowwiki.com/Image:NorthrendingamemapByElrynn.jpg)<br />
02:40 : Northrend map, same as this fan map (http://www.wowwiki.com/Image:NorthrendInGame.jpg)<br />
02:45 : Cinematic ... From Warcraft 3, the Frozen throne, this is the first part of the ending cinematic. (Screenshot from the original (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/end1.jpg))<br />
03:18 : Map, I think it's from Warcraft 3 : FT too, but I'm not sure about this one.<br />
03:22 : End of the cinematic used earlier. (Screenshot from the original (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/june/end2.jpg))<br />
<br />
<br />
For &quot;real&quot; (but speculated) informations about Northrend, you can always check this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=193.0)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sarnat</div><div class="date">2007-06-28, 12:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was just *bad*. Especially the logo.<br />
<br />
I doubt it even was made by that Fanatik guy, don't know why he'd make a fake.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avelar</div><div class="date">2007-06-28, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The map that Boubouille isn't sure about, is actually from WC3TFT. It's also the map used in the loading screen of X-HeroSiege, my favourite WC3 pastime :P<br />
<br />
Beyond me why someone would waste the time making this. As to whether or not it was Fanatik, I don't think so.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jamie Star</div><div class="date">2007-06-28, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If someone was going to make a fake trailer it would be nice if they actually put some effort into it. That was just shockingly bad, I couldn't believe for a second that was real. I know Blizzard sometimes don't put the effort they should do when making stuff but seriously thank God they put more work into it than that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaajc</div><div class="date">2007-06-28, 01:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the idea of it was nice imo =)..<br />
<br />
Anyone who can tell what the second song he used in the &quot;trailer&quot; is ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-06-28, 01:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">rofl World of Warcraft: The Northrend<br />
<br />
This guy obviously knows nothing of lore or basic english, that enough should've been enough to prove this was false<br />
<br />
It wouldn't be called &quot;The Northrend&quot; maybe &quot;The Northlands&quot; but definitly not, Northrend is a name, you don't put &quot;The&quot; before it..<br />
<br />
Not to mention Fanatik's videos are so much simpler, his use of editting is minimalistic and his videos are full of content<br />
<br />
Wait.. is fanatik a night elf?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theaddman</div><div class="date">2007-06-28, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what is the song at the very end of the video? its in the fast and furious: Tokyo drift, been after the song for months, a bit off topic but if anyone can help would be greatly appreciated :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burk</div><div class="date">2007-06-28, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">mmh if it was made by Fanatik i would alsow be found here<br />

With models changing all is possible. For exemple my warrior twink lvl 19 is full set Aq40 with The Dark edge of insanity (c'thun), only me can view it but ... all can make a nice fake.<br />
But lol.. the man who has make this one is very bad. The best part is the loggin screen ahah SPOTTED!</div></div><hr />

&quot; Today we have received an announcement from Blizzard that the side is to be removed immediately and is threatened with a lawyer. After a small conversation we c steal to the responsible still one or different picture.&quot;<br />
<br />
owned. :-\</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arantar</div><div class="date">2007-06-28, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People must really be naive if they believe these sorts of videos...<br />
<br />
But then again, the Martians did eat the Wisps being the new Alliance race.<br />
<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
Edit Boubouille : Don't be so mean.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-06-29, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please avoid nationalist comments, people all over the world fell for it.. not just Martians..<br />
<br />
Edit Boubouille : Changed to reflect the edit on the previous post.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-29, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did a few edit on the last two comments. *cough*</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaigami</div><div class="date">2007-06-29, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol this was my first time seeing this video but man...i gotta agree with the other guy.<br />
<br />
You'd have to be really, really naive to believe any part of this video.<br />
<br />
The only part of it that carried anything that looked blizzard authentic was the loading screen...and thats of course because it was stolen from WC3:FT xD<br />
<br />
Anyway a decent attempt at a forgery, and a big compliment to fanatik that people are impersonating him...but still laughably bad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-06-29, 02:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Poor martians.. =(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arantar</div><div class="date">2007-06-29, 03:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who is Fanatik? Everyone seems to know him, but I don't...<br />
<br />
Then again, I'm not really a lot into WoW movies.<br />
<br />
And to Boubouille, sorry for the remarks, didn't mean any harm with them &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-29, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got a call from mars, they don't mind.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Fanatik is the guy who did the first tier 4, tier 5, and tier 6 armor sets video. He's also known for working on a few more unofficial things that we won't name here.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mihah</div><div class="date">2007-07-01, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone nice enough to tell me the name of the first song in the movie? I know its by Rammstein, dunno the title though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cvijafaq</div><div class="date">2007-07-09, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who is Fanatik? Everyone seems to know him, but I don't...<br />
<br />
Fanatik released TBC tier armor videos before TBC was released, and T6 video before the patch with Black Temple.<br />
<br />
Also not only does it look like a poorly done video, that person has a rather bad music taste in my opinion. Eugh.<br />
The first song in the movie is Rammstein - Los by the way. What? It's the other songs/bands I don't like &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juju</div><div class="date">2007-07-16, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi, I am a half Martian, and I would like to say I am very offened by that comment about my mother's noble race. As soon as I find you, you will get abducted and we will shove a lot of tool in private parts of your body then erase your memory and turn you into a old lady!<br />
The rest: have a good day!<br />
