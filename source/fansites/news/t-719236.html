IRVINE, Calif., May 18, 2010 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that tickets for its fifth BlizzCon(R) gaming convention will go on sale in two batches on Wednesday, June 2 and Saturday, June 5, 2010. BlizzCon is a celebration of the global player communities surrounding Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft(R), Diablo(R), and StarCraft(R) game universes. The event will take place at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California on October 22 and 23. Live coverage of the event will be available as a DIRECTV(R) Pay Per View package and as a multi-channel Internet stream, allowing viewers online to switch between coverage of multiple panels and activities during the show.<br />
<br />
&quot;BlizzCon is a unique opportunity for our players to meet one another, strengthen the friendships they've formed online, and have a great time celebrating a shared passion for gaming together with Blizzard employees,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;For those who can't attend, we're pleased to be providing an unprecedented level of access to the activities and attractions that BlizzCon has to offer.&quot;<br />
<br />
In addition to serving as a gathering place for the different Blizzard Entertainment gaming communities, BlizzCon will have an array of activities, including discussion panels, competitive and casual tournaments, contests, hands-on playtime with current and upcoming Blizzard Entertainment games, and more.<br />
<br />
Tickets to the convention will be priced at $150 USD each and will be available for purchase from the official BlizzCon website at www.blizzcon.com. Tickets will be released in two separate batches on June 2 at 7 p.m. Pacific time and on June 5 at 10 a.m. Pacific time. Those interested in attending BlizzCon can simplify the purchase process by registering a Battle.net account at www.battle.net before ticket sales begin.<br />
<br />
The popular DIRECTV(R) BlizzCon Pay Per View event will return in 2010, available to existing DIRECTV customers in the United States for $39.95 USD. The event will again deliver comprehensive live HD coverage from the show floor on each day of the convention, including exclusive interviews, demos, and more.<br />
<br />
Gamers around the world will also have the option to purchase the Pay Per View event as a multi-channel Internet stream, also priced at $39.95 USD (pricing may vary by region). For the first time, anyone who purchases the Internet stream will be able to switch freely between multiple channels of coverage dedicated to different areas of BlizzCon, allowing online viewers expanded access to the panels and events they're most interested in. DIRECTV customers who order the televised event will receive this Internet stream at no extra charge, allowing them to watch in the format of their choice. Those who order the event will also receive this year's BlizzCon-exclusive World of Warcraft(R) in-game item (availability may vary by region), to be revealed at a later date. Limited streaming coverage of the BlizzCon opening ceremony and certain BlizzCon tournaments will be available via the Internet for free.<br />
<br />
As BlizzCon draws closer, further details about the show, including ordering and programming information for the DIRECTV BlizzCon Pay Per View event and multi-channel Internet stream, will be announced at www.blizzcon.com.<br />
<br />
To keep pace with the continued growth of World of Warcraft as well as development on other Blizzard Entertainment games, the company is currently hiring for numerous open positions. More information on available career opportunities can be found at www.blizzard.com/jobs.</div></div><hr />

THANK YOU! FINALLY!<br />
<br />
Now also please secure your damn stream. Last year there were tons of people that 'hacked' into the stream, ie. were able to watch without paying, took up bandwidth for paying customers. One way to do this was a simple JavaScript exploit, that's really fucking embarrasing for such a big company.<br />
<br />
I also hope the gimmick this year won't be another pet/murloc. Grunty was cool and everything but I'm already well over 100 pets, guess there's a lot of people out there with a metric ton of pets. Something else, like the murloc suit would be awesome. Or a really cool tabard or whatever.</div></div><hr />

To watch it online, you just have to purchase the Directtv show thing. well worth the $40. You don't have to queue up in the online queue, as they dont sell out of online viewing tickets</div></div><hr />

My mate said the money he spent on the ticket and then the money for flight and hotel was worth it, as it was an awesome event.<br />
<br />
The Live Coverage is well worth the $40. I watched it last year. It was awesome! And you get the BlizzCon item :P</div></div><hr />

That's weird, we had to queue for Celestial Steeds (AKA. TRH.) and they don't sell out of them.<br />

<br />
As far as I am aware the BlizzCon online vid 'tickets' are not done on Blizz's site. And there will be less of a queue due to the fact that you can buy the vid 'ticket' at any point upto and during the 'con (iirc).<br />
<br />

<br />
Blizzard did this amazing thing called &quot;lying&quot; obviously alot of people have quit lately but their statement will be true once Cataclysm hits (probably just after blizzcon). So they are full of shit with the statement right now but I'm sure come expansion there will be a commercial that says THIRTEEN MILLION SUBS. Which will slowly dwindle back down to the 9-10 million when people get bored.... but 9 million @ 15 /mo...etc.... yah they dont care.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aikouka</div><div class="date">2010-05-18, 04:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmm $150... I went 2 years ago and it was only $100 (if I remember correctly). But if they're inviting the larger number of people again (8k vs 12k), why is the cost going up so much? Are they bringing in some fancy performer like last year? But I'd suspect that more people means you're driving the cost to support the event down.<br />
<br />
I also agree with that other poster... the Internet stream was god awful last year. I eventually found out that Justin.tv had their own stream that wasn't lagging out every few seconds, so I watched that instead of the one I paid for.</div></div><hr />

Continued growth of the game could mean literally the growth of the content (and that's why they need peeps)... or it could imply the increase in sales due to selling mounts/pets this year.... could even mean a mild increae of &quot;re-activated&quot; accounts that came on in the past couple weeks in hopes of getting into Beta.<br />

I like the new feature of being able to switch channels on the internet stream. I might actually order it this year. Previous years just went over a friend who has ordered it and watched (but there are quite a few filler interviews that arent as interesting as say watching an arena tourney or SC tourney. So it will be nice to switch to some of those) And can wait to see this years Ingame Item</div></div><hr />

Log in early, say a few hail marys, and press F5 like your life depends on it.</div></div><hr />

Well, this is news to me. Thought the population has staled at 11,5 million. Still, pleasant news at that.<br />

I think what they mean by 'continued growth' is how WoW is always changing with the addition of new patches, expansions, etc.</div></div><hr />

You can do this (although I would agree with your first statement if you scalp;) ). We have a friend that gets all of ours at one time and we just give him the money beforehand.</div></div><hr />

I wonder that too. I heard the tickets are personal, but I'm obviously going to buy both tickets from my account, not switching to my husband's account for the other ticket with the risk of being too late. I guess that's ok though... right? ???</div></div><hr />

The hotel that is attached to the convention center is the Hilton. Last year, I shared some beer with Blizzard employees at the bar, so there's one party-spot right there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A $25 increase far outpaces current inflation rates.<br />
<br />
Annual inflation between 2009 and 2010 was 2.72%. So if Blizz wanted to charge the same value for the event, tickets would be $128.40.<br />
<br />
Thus, they simply want to make more money, which I have zero problem with.<br />

L2economics.</div></div><hr />

I'm a bit underweight, actually, and rollercoasters are the best rides on the planet, which Disneyland simply does not have enough of, though the one at California Adventure is ballin'.</div></div><hr />

I'd probably get a better view of the panels if I watched DirecTV.<br />

It's not yearly, but I'm sure they'll do another Worldwide Invitational, which I heard was a lot better than BlizzCon, probably cause it had a lot of information on Diablo 3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they will sell out in almost minutes. Actually i believe this to be rather cheap part. i know people travel from east coast and stay in motels costing a grand or more to do this so the 150 for the ticket is chump change. In fact i have about 5 guildies all going together which they say the trip will cost them close to $800 per person. but on a sidenote people complain about everything else and this blizzcon thing is a joke. I boycott it. also this is the reason for a later cata release.</div></div><hr />

And the fact that they are limiting the number of audiences to attend will set the price bit higher than what you might expect. Remember, Blizzard doesn't have to do this, infact I don't think they raise the ticket price for sake of making extra bucks. If they want to be cheap, they can just showcase there new stuff at other trade show just like any other game studios. I believe this is previllege and gift for us, Blizzard fans. No one said you have to attend this event so why QQ?? Last year, I payed more than suggested price to some guy who had the ticket for sale in my neighborhood ads. Being there for the first time, hearing all the announcements, developers Q&amp;A pro-gamers playing tournaments, exeriencing Diablo, Cata, SC even before it goes into beta testing, paying $15 for two tacos and a soda is priceless.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karash</div><div class="date">2010-05-20, 03:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I went to the GamesCom in Cologne last year which was a 4-day-event and had 4 halls filled with all kind of booths from various gaming companies where you could play most of the current games at the time INCLUDING Diablo3. There were also live events (including an Ensidia-Liveraid and live acts from musicians), an outdoor beach area and free Coke Zero (although that might have been the year before when the event was in Leipzig, not sure about that part). I paid 30 bucks for my weekend-ticket.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard needs money so badly they might wanna ask Mr.Kotick about some, I hear he's building a big safe somewhere in a town called Duckburg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree. Was hoping they would announce if the ticket count was going up etc. Last year though they did add more space for the increase ticket count; it did not include enough seating for main events. There was basically no where close to enough room for what they have to know the majority of people are going to. <br />
<br />
2008 was not to bad, you could find seating or stand off the the sides. <br />
<br />
2009. You were better off sitting in the arena area and watch the main hall on the tvs. <br />
<br />
But CA is CA and always worth a reason to go out there, blizzcon is just a additional sight to see.</div></div><hr />
