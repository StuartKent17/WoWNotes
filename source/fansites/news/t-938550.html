Q: I spend a lot of my time in raids keeping Water Shield up, which I rely on to maintain enough mana. There have been times I've neglected to heal someone because I had to refresh Water Shield. Why are shaman healers less effective compared to other healing classes? – Epistemology (NA), Ерз (EU-RU)<br />
<br />
A: We’d like to be more consistent about what does and doesn’t trigger Water Shield. Having the shield trigger when taking direct damage, and consume an orb, is consistent with how all shaman shields work. On some encounters though, constant pulsing damage probably burns through those charges too quickly and doesn’t need to do so – that said, if you’re having to refresh Water Shield often, that also generally means that you’re getting a large amount of extra mana from all those procs that are burning through it. A situational glyph (like we have for Lightning Shield) could help with this issue, and that may be something we consider in the future.<br />
<br />
Shaman raid tank healing is, if anything, underrated. With a combination of Earth Shield, Riptide, and Greater Healing Wave fuelled by Tidal Waves, a shaman’s throughput can be quite impressive. Yes, a Holy paladin using Beacon can more effectively heal two tanks who are simultaneously taking damage, but on the other hand, a shaman can deal better with multi-target damage or healing clumps of players. Healers have different strengths and weaknesses, which is fine as long as it doesn’t get too extreme, but we recognize that the core functionality of being able to heal a single tank who is taking heavy damage from a boss is something all healers need to be able to do, and we’re satisfied with the current balance in that regard. We will, of course, make adjustments if inequalities begin to appear.<br />
<br />
The Mana Tide change in 4.2 was primarily aimed at reducing the mana available to non-shaman healers in raids. In short, shaman are balanced around always having their own Mana Tide, but other healers are instead balanced around their personal cooldowns (Shadowfiend, Innervate, etc.). Adding Tide on top of those often led to other healers having access to so much mana that managing the resource became a non-issue in many situations. The change from Improved Water Shield to Resurgence was designed to offset the Mana Tide reduction’s personal impact to the shaman. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Is it intended for “smart” heals and target capped aoe spells to heal companions/pets like bloodworms instead of players? Can you redesign Shaman’s Chain Heal, so that it can jump over full HP players to a target without full HP? Do you have any plans to make chain heal stronger/more appealing for 5man/10man content? – Epicfail (NA), 珍妮佛羅培根 (TW), Pikapika (NA)<br />
<br />
A: True AoE heals (e.g. Healing Rain) will heal pets and guardians, but will not count those units towards the AoE cap. We’d prefer for “smart” heals to prioritize players over non-players whenever possible, and we’ll continue to improve the logic on such heals until that is the case – it certainly doesn’t feel particularly satisfying to see that you’ve just delivered a critical heal to a Bloodworm.<br />
<br />
Chain Heal is inherently a situational spell – that situation tends to arise more often the more players are present, but we don’t have any plans to redesign the spell to make it the go-to heal when there are fewer players present, or they are all spread far apart. We’d rather augment other tools, or add new ones, if it appears that Shaman healing is inadequate for particular situations. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: At the start of Cataclysm, the the idea was given that developers wanted to step away from niche healing and let all healers be capable tank or raid healers. Has this goal since changed? Is there any plan to change the dogma “Holy Paladin = Tank healer”? As I remember, devs said that they wanted to change this formula in a past interview but Holy Paladins are still considered as a tank healer, indispensable for raid. Even thought other healers can heal tankers, there are people who say that this job is hard for other healers. – Frazlo (NA), *롤학개론 (KR)<br />
<br />
A: The goal hasn’t changed. We added three new heals for paladins and changed their resource model to make them a better group healer. You can argue that we didn’t go far enough and we should have given paladins even more new heals, but we didn’t want the Holy spec to be unrecognizable for a long-time player.<br />
<br />
We suspect several paladins would turn your question around and argue that it’s not that they are indispensible tank healers, but that they can’t compete against other healers for group healing. Ultimately, we think the problem is Holy Radiance. Light of Dawn is a finisher so it’s never going to be continuously available for periods of intense group healing without unshackling it from Holy Power. Holy Radiance could be changed however. Our original concept of Holy Radiance being a tool the paladin used to heal those around her never quite panned out – we had to keep bumping the range to make it a useful heal, which removed much of the positional gameplay. Currently it is potent, but fairly “fire and forget.” A paladin is never choosing not to use Holy Radiance, unless perhaps mana is very tight. A better model for Holy Radiance, and something we are considering for the next content patch, is as a cast-time spell with no cooldown that generates Holy Power (for Holy paladins at least). This would give Holy paladins an actual area-healing rotation -- Holy Radiance and Light of Dawn -- that they could use instead of the single-target heals. Currently Holy Radiance can just be layered on top of the other heals, so the paladin isn’t shifting into group-healing mode the way a shaman can focus on Chain Heal or a priest can focus on Prayer of Healing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are you still considering creating a new heroic class of healer? Are there any plans for adding any new class with a healing talent tree in future expansions? – Molatuna (EU-FR), Elvenadoren (EU-EN)<br />
<br />
A: Obviously, we can’t talk about future expansions yet. What we can share is that whenever we have discussed adding a new class that can heal, the biggest question we debate is whether the healing model should be similar to the existing classes or something radically different. Something different has the potential to attract players currently burned out on healing or maybe even new healers. On the other hand, it would be much harder to balance. We know the three-heal, mana-and-Spirit based system largely works. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What are the developers' thoughts on perhaps giving Discipline priests three strengths/types of shields/absorbs, in a similar manner as all other healers have three main heals? Discipline priests (especially those purely going for absorb) always were unique through this absorb, I mean: Shields. Why does this become shorter and shorter, always saying we should go for direct healing instead? In that case you could play another healing class that has better direct heals. – Kahlan (NA), Zerreshju (EU-DE)<br />
<br />
A: Balancing the Discipline Priest is often challenging because they can provide so much more damage prevention than the other healers. If Discipline priests had all absorb spells instead of heals, it might make them mandatory for all raids but weak when healing a 5-player dungeon. That said, replacing one of the three mainstay heals with an absorb for Disc is certainly something we’ve talked about before. It’s too big a change for the current expansion but something we’d like to explore in the future. Power Word: Shield is instant so it’s hard to build a whole rotation around that spell. If Discipline had an efficient cast-time absorb and then used Power Word: Shield more for instant healing, their toolkit would feel more fleshed out. However, players who cling to the attitude of “I’m a Disc priest; I should only shield,” aren’t really understanding our design for the class. Ditto with druids who only want to cast hots, or paladins who only want to drop heal bombs on the main tank. “I’m good at something” isn’t the same as “I only do that thing.” <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: When healing, it is hard to see the overall screen because healers must keep an eye on the Raid frame. And due to PVP balance issues, dispels are only allowed for healer’s. This situation makes it too harsh for the healers and gives to much responsibility and also a burden because healers have to heal and move at the same time during raids. Isn’t this a little too harsh? – *페** (KR), 신*하군 (KR)<br />
<br />
A: Well, raiding isn’t only hard for healers. In fact, most of the time the damage seems unhealable, it’s probably because it is intended to be unhealable and there is some aspect of the fight that you’re missing or not executing as well as you could. While raiding healers have a lot of responsibility. It is our sense that most of them want that responsibility – that it is what attracts them to healing.<br />
<br />
While we agree that we’ve had fights with too much “urgent dispelling” as you put it, we’ve tried to be better about that in more recent content. The dispels on Valiona and Theralion or Ascendant Council need to be done at the right moment, which is emphatically not as soon as the debuff appears. You need a smart dispeller for those mechanics, not a quick dispeller. We also had fairly “urgent interrupts” in Blackwing Descent and Bastion of Twilight, which are often the responsibility of melee, we continue to have situations where tanks need to respond immediately to something (say a tank swap or incoming adds), and we have mechanics where anyone who isn’t aware of their surroundings can wipe their whole group.<br />
<br />
We definitely use incoming damage as a tuning mechanism, but we also use berserk timers to set a high bar for the DPS specs. There is a risk that if berserk timers are too tightly tuned that raids may attempt to replace healers with more DPS, which isn’t doing the healers any favors either. Note that limiting dispels to healers isn’t just a PvP balance issue. We wanted to know for sure that every 5-player group would be able to dispel magic. The alternatives were that there could never be important debuffs to dispel or some healers just wouldn’t be viable for some content. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Healers are usually responsible for the loss of the teammate, but not all the mistakes are made by healers, such as over taunt or damage zone avoidance. This also happens in the 5 man dungeons frequently. Is there any chance to add a design to punish damage classes with inappropriate behavior? Is there ever going to be a clear indicator that the indivdual died from &quot;unhealable damage&quot; in combat logs/on screen warning? – 明亮 (TW), Galadruin (EU-EN)<br />
<br />
A: We see the mindset slowly changing from the notion that anytime someone dies, it’s the healer’s fault. We agree that there could be more situations where we make it obvious that the healer couldn’t realistically save the DPS from their mistake. On the other hand, saving other characters is part of the fun of playing a healer, so we don’t want to totally remove that gameplay. We also provide many specs with sprints, self-heals and emergency buttons of their owns, so the answer shouldn’t always be unhealable damage. We also are making more and more use of mechanics where “standing in the fire” doesn’t cause damage, but causes a debuff which lowers DPS, hitting those players where it hurts the most. Finally, we are exploring more on-screen warnings for dangerous debuffs in the same way we alert you when certain class procs have gone off. We just have to be careful not to turn the default UI into an unrecognizable sound and light show. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: How do you plan on addressing our inflating spirit and mana pools later in the expansion to keep mana a resource, rather than a solid blue bar? Do you plan to preserve a principle of rational use of mana, which makes it interesting to play a healer? In the beginning of Cataclysm we had to use almost every spell to succeed, while now everything is about pushing a couple of your best healing spells. With the release of a new patch the level of equipment will raise significantly, and we won’t have to think about mana regeneration any more. Do you plan to somehow adjust encounters or healing mechanics perhaps? – Nehalim (NA), Ксенас (EU-RU)<br />
<br />
A: Our plan was always that healers could gradually grow out of being very mana-limited, but we didn’t want that to happen in the very first tier of content. If it happens in the final tier of content, that’s fine. It will help healers feel like they have actually become more powerful from accumulating so much gear. Consider that tank health, mitigation and avoidance increase with each tier, as does the size of heals and the rate at which you cast them, and those are probably sufficient to offset the increased damage being done by bosses and trash.<br />
<br />
In heroic raids, even today, healers often rely on their inefficient heals a great deal, so there isn’t a ton of room to expand into becoming even more inefficient (and therefore requiring more mana regeneration). As such, you should consider Spirit somewhere in between the stat continuum of hit and something like haste or crit. For the former, there are hard caps. For the latter, there are inflexion points where the value of a stat grows faster or slower, but in general more is always helpful. For Spirit you need enough to feel good about your healing longevity and anything beyond that is probably of diminishing value. We think this actually makes itemization as a healer more interesting for the player than just grabbing more and more of a particular uber stat.<br />
<br />
With the raid content we have released for Cataclysm so far, we feel like we can put pressure on healers to keep tanks alive without repeating the gameplay we had in Wrath of the Lich King, where the smart way to play was to keep heals constantly going because of the risk of the tank dying in two back to back hits. Even with increasing regeneration, we don’t think we’ll get back to a two-shot the tank situation for Cataclysm. If your tanks are dying faster than you can heal them currently, again, you’re probably missing something about the encounter or aren’t quite ready for it yet.<br />
<br />
We had originally planned on having bosses in later tiers scale so that players would need more crit, hit, expertise, dodge and parry for later tiers. We ultimately decided not to do this, at least for the current expansion. That decision was driven partially because we couldn’t figure out an elegant way for stats like haste to scale with boss power and partially because we weren’t convinced our planned UI would communicate the concept clearly enough to players. For example, would just bosses be affected? Just raid bosses? If not, would you want separate sets of gear for dungeons vs. raids? Those are solvable problems, but we weren’t convinced the path we were on would solve them as well as we would like.<br />
<br />
Our current numbers wouldn’t work if we had a dozen raid tiers before increasing the level cap, but that’s not our plan. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to give Holy Priests access to a viable 3-minute raid cooldown? There are concerns that without a cooldown along the lines of Power Word: Barrier, Spirit Link Totem, or Tranquility, we may need to play disc a lot in firelands. Maybe simply an improved Divine Hymn? – Maladi (NA)<br />
<br />
A: You can make the argument that the Holy priest doesn’t have a similar raid cooldown like Power Word: Barrier, or that Divine Hymn isn’t as powerful as Tranquility. However, we feel the Holy priest toolkit overall is strong, that they provide meaningful contributions to raid healing, and are well represented in actual raid groups. It’s possible we may make Divine Hymn more of a Holy (rather than Discipline) priest thing in the future, and bump it up to around where Tranquility is, if the need presents itself. Overall, Holy priests are fine. They have enough benefits that few guilds seem to be sitting them for want of yet another raid cooldown, and Guardian Spirit remains an exceptional tank cooldown. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Looking at the healer changes with patch 4.2, there are changes being made to paladins and druids, but there doesn't appear to be any for either the priest or shaman. Do you feel comfortable with where these two classes are? Where do you feel the other healers are at currently? – Sergan (LA)<br />
<br />
A: As we write this, heroic attempts on the Firelands raid have just begun and the new PvP season has started. At this time, we are happy with all five of the healing specs. We don’t think there is a weak or mandatory healer. We try not to change things just for the sake of change. We know that constant changes can be exhausting for players, so we try to resist the urge to tinker with mechanics, specs or classes that are basically working fine. We suspect that sometimes players fall into a mode where if they don’t see copious patch notes for their character that they feel like we don’t love them anymore. We love all of our classes. If you don’t see any changes in patch notes it either means that we don’t think changes are warranted yet, or that we have future plans to change things that we haven’t quite solidified or lack the ability to implement exactly how we want. This doesn’t mean every class is now perfect and requires no additional tweaks – far from it. Just try and distinguish between “my dude hasn’t changed lately” and “my dude is fundamentally broken and the developers don’t know or don’t care.” We can assure you the latter sentiment is never the case. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: What is the reasoning behind certain classes that lack a healing spec (such as a rogue) being able to self-heal better than a dps spec of a healing class (such as a balance druid)? – Idej (NA)<br />
<br />
A: A great recipe for class homogenization is to go down the list of every ability and make sure that every class has their own version of that ability. We don’t think powerful self-healing is mandatory for every character. Some classes are inherently better at it than others. As long as the overall package is competitive, it’s okay for specs or classes to have strengths and weaknesses. If the overall package isn’t competitive, we’ll certainly hear about it.<br />
<br />
Our definition of hybrid class is a class that has a tank or healing spec. We don’t spend much effort to make sure that the DPS specs of hybrid classes are more “hybridy” than the DPS specs of mage, warlock, rogue or hunter. Sometimes hybrid DPS specs might be able to throw out a heal, but unless used very strategically, those contributions are often in the rounding error of the healing provided by the dedicated healers. And when DPS specs are healing themselves (Frost and Unholy DKs before 4.2) or others (Ret paladins before 4.1) too much, we take action there as well. So it’s not a priority for us that Balance druids are great healers. We recognized going into Cataclysm that rogues had a lot of down time while solo, that they didn’t have many options for spending combo points after a target died prematurely, and that too much rogue survivability was based around crowd controlling an opponent. Thus we thought there was a need for Recuperate. If Balance druids have similar challenges, then we’d look for solutions for them as well, but they would hopefully be unique or at least kit-appropriate solutions. <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: With the changes being made to critical heals, do you feel that crit will become a more prominent stat for healers, up there with haste and mastery? Or is it a less important change aimed at balancing between the pve and pvp aspects of the game? – Derëk (LA)<br />
<br />
A: Even with the 4.2 changes, haste may very well be a more attractive stat for healers. We’re just trying to narrow the gap. It’s not important for all stats to be identical as long as they aren’t so far apart that you’re tempted to keep perfectly optimized gear from a previous tier instead of less perfectly optimized gear from a new tier. We want a healer to take gear with crit seriously (even if he would ultimately prefer haste) rather than passing or sharding it. We made the change mostly for itemization reasons and for any PvP vs. PvE concerns. PvP healers tend to have low crit chances anyway and we have other ways to balance healing in PvP should it become too powerful (predominantly the Mortal Strike and related debuffs). <br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Do you feel that the three-heal model you implemented at the start of Cataclysm is a success? Have you changed your expectations or goals in regards to the three-heal model after watching a tier of raiding? How do you feel about how the various specs are using or avoiding these three core heals? – Anohako (NA)<br />
<br />
A: Overall, we still like the model and we intend to keep supporting it. One flaw with the system is that healers in 5-player dungeons often have to make harder choices about which of the three core heals to use at any given moment. In raids, especially in 25-player mode, healers can afford to specialize more. To be fair, raids often replace spell-choice complexity with encounter complexity, but overall it would be nice if players graduated from less complexity to more complexity as they went into more challenging content rather than the reverse. As a theoretical example, imagine that priests didn’t have access to Greater Heal in 5-player dungeons, so the choice would be between the fast, expensive Flash Heal vs. the slower, efficient Heal (in addition to all their other tools of course). It’s hard to develop a system that would make such a restriction make sense, but you get the idea.<br />
<br />
When comparing classes, the intent was always that the druid and Disc priest would use those three core heals the least. It is a design problem (though not a massive one) that those two specs can specialize so much in 25-player raids that they can forsake their three core heals to a great extent. In smaller groups, they still need to look at their full toolbox. We like the way the shaman works, particularly with Tidal Waves providing synergy among the three core heals. The paladin model is close but as mentioned above, they have to rely on the three heals too much because they don’t have another heal like Riptide or Penance to add to the mix. Holy priests still suffer a bit of the reverse where there are so many heals that it’s hard to provide niches for them all. We’ve talked about a spec model where there are even more specialization spells (like the ones you get at level 10) so that we can have more spells for each healer without players having to spend talent points on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine a lot of that has to do with the opposite being true in PVE. Druids are dominating meters and Shamans struggle a bit, especially in 10 man. If they adjust either class to address PVE or PVP there will be a harmful effect on the raiding environment. (For example, most Shamans, have completely stopped using Healing Surge in PVE after the PVP nerf) <br />
<br />
I imagine Blizzard is struggling to come up with solutions that will narrow the gap in both environments without having something like: &quot;In pvp this spell heals X and in PVE the spell heals Y&quot; which would become tedious and tiresome.<br />

<br />
I think priests switching to disc is more because druids are doing so well at raid healing right now so priests are finding themselves becoming more useful as tank healers than as raid healers. (In addition to your reasons above). Holy is probably a little weak, but ultimately there will always be variation. Priests should be thankful that they are the only healing class with the ability to switch their role when the other isn't doing as well.</div></div><hr />

While not the &quot;end all be all&quot; of current class rankings it also cannot be ignored that every other healing spec is about the same on stateofdps and druids are 10-12% ahead in 25 man raids, closer to 20% in 10 mans, although pally catches up a bit. I see the same in my raids, druids are dominating the meters. (That said healing meters aren't everything but in big damage phases a Druid definitely pays off)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids inherently have a great deal of throughput BUT it mainly goes to waste because of overhealing. Unless you get into big damage phases as you say than the numbers aren't nearly as wasted. It's poor design on Blizzard's end.<br />

I'm not sure if there was an overall lack of druid questions or if Blizzard intentionally set them aside for more &quot;imperative&quot; questions. You're right, we are in dire need of a cd to help tanks out but I believe they addressed before months ago they were working on something. Obviously we haven't seen shit though. The new mastery didn't hurt tank healers as much as you say it did. It only nerfed it by a little bit but with the new mastery it really buffed druids for 25s.</div></div><hr />

State of DPS is completely unreliable as an actual gauge of anything really. For quite a long time, guild have cheesed fights just to get people ranked. One healing a fight with a blood DK and two shadowpriests can get any healer ranked really high in the old tier. Desired DPS get PIs and tricks. The newest iteration of scamming for high ratings is turning the log on for the last 30 seconds or so of a fight, blow all CDs and use your big spells.<br />
<br />
Even if people weren't cheesing fights, all druid &quot;OP&quot; throughput means is OP overheals.</div></div><hr />

True, but think of this. burn phase of boss requires max dps (with fire or w/e on ground) and all of your melee are standing in it getting penalized dps. will you make the timer? will boss enrage? doesnt seem viable to me. in some situations maybe so, but i propose a 20g loss for every heal i cast on people who refuse to move out of shit on the ground lol j/k</div></div><hr />

There is a lot to deny. At the start of Cata resto druids were HORRIBLE with AoE heals. They had to buff the hell out of efflo just to keep us consistent in hardmodes and 25s. It was not surprising for higher up guilds to bench druids for fights like nef. Ever wonder why exactly they revamped our mastery? We have been decent tank healers but a pally would do much better.<br />
<br />
Let me also ask you this: Why in the hell would you think resto druids do not need a dmg reduction cd? Blues even confirmed we need one at some point, problem is nothing has come to fruition yet. ....Have we been playing the same game?</div></div><hr />

I think you misunderstood what he was saying. Other healing classes have the ability to mitigate damage somehow, to prevent it from happening (shields) or reduce it by some percentage (barrier, pally hand).<br />
<br />
Druids have no mitigation. We can't stop incoming damage from happening. So, to balance this, we put out more raw healing, because we *have* to. Those are the tools given to us.<br />
<br />
He never said, directly or by implication, that druids are &quot;bad&quot; because of this. I have no idea where you got that impression.<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Druids can't stop people from taking damage, so we have to be able to just suck it up and heal through it.</div></div><hr />

I'm aware of the lack of dmg reduction they have, there was no misunderstanding. Even though Druids might need some changes, they're in such a good spot in terms of PvE healing, I find it hard to believe anyone would even hint at the fact that they are weak overall.<br />
<br />
Okay, so you're saying they lack in some areas, that's fine... they lack in damage mitigation, okay. So what? They are incredibly efficient. I know meters and things like raidbots only show pure heals or maybe absorbs (that don't show for other healer's performance), which is why Druids are usually on top (throughput), but even with that being said, they still perform fantastically. I have a hard time listening to someone say Druids need more help than Shamans or possibly Priests, though. Maybe you weren't saying that at all. Honestly, I was more surprised that some people seemed to think Druids needed significant help in the PvE department.<br />
<br />

You have said this entire expansion that druids have been fine. There is a flaw there. Whether you wish to see that or not is not my problem. Even now druids are working under a flawed design. I've stated why that is. Not once have I said they are in a bad spot in terms of having low numbers. We are wasting so much to overhealing when that doesn't need to be.</div></div><hr />

I see arguments about this in chat all the damn time. Hell, even in our guild, a pally healer was furious about how even with better gear than our best druid (not by much, mind you) that the druid was still topping the meter. So we had to go back to 7th grade math class to explain it to him:<br />
<br />
Let &quot;Incoming Damage&quot; = X<br />
Let &quot;Amount Mitigated&quot; = Y<br />
Let &quot;Amount Mitigated by DRUID&quot; = 0<br />
Let &quot;Amount you need to heal&quot; = Z<br />
<br />
You see where this goes... LOL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids are the best PvE healers for the past 2 if not 3 expansions. Who fucking cares that they don't have a tank CD, they are not a lone healer in the raid. I would swap my Guardian Spirit for their throughput any day. Seriously, they spam the whole raid and yet they have no mana issues and end up like 20 million more healing done (effective) at the end of the raid. Yes, they have more overhealing, but who cares, in fact having such a mana sustainability while overhealing so much and healing much better then any other healer, is just sick. <br />
<br />
Holy Priests do well in burst healing, but then they spend 30% of the fight regaining mana. And burst healing is not really needed in any of the fight in Cataclysm, save maybe Chimaeron and even there the Druid shines like an asshole with his tranquility and treeform. <br />
<br />
On top of that Druids can combat rez people with full hp, that's like a CD they are looking for. If the tank dies it's not always the end of the line and if you CR him, and he's back in the game, it's worth more as my Guardian Spirit which is nice, but not really mandatory for anything. <br />
<br />
As said, druids shine for a long time now, the healing might be boring, but they are making the game much much easier for everyone, healing without a druid in the raid is a pain in the ass. I don't want them to get nerfed, but bring other AOE healers up to par with druids throughput.</div></div><hr />

Buncha hypocrites. :D Or maybe I misread their intent.<br />
<br />
I lol'd when I saw two the guys arguing that druids need a tank CD. Might as well argue that a disc priest needs a smart heal then, or that holy priests need an innervate-type ability or maybe a tranquility-like ability (divine hymn is nowhere near as good), or that shamans need an aoe CD. Oh wait, that last thing happened, and turns out; they nerfed other class' aoe abilities so the encounter difficulty stays the same.<br />
<br />
Do note, you're not the only one playing the game. Yeah. It's a multiplayer game. A massively multiplayer game even.... that probably means you need to work together. As long as you're downing the bosses together it's fine. If you're getting benched it probably isn't the fault of your 'class being shit'. Benching for that isn't gonna happen unless you're in one of those top tier guilds that wants to optimize everything so they can go through content asap. And if you are, you'd simply adapt. However if you still have issues with your class not being as good as some other classes in a niche that they're exclusively better in (while you have your own niche) then maybe... (in Darnells famous words) &quot;IT'S TIME TO REROOOOOLLLLLLLL&quot; <br />
<br />
Or just maybe its time to quit! Although I wouldn't do that for something as miniscule as 'not getting a tankhealing cooldown'. I myself quit because I got bored waiting for different raid content for more than 6 months. <br />

If you come up against a team of 4 healers 6 dps its GG because your in for the longest boring battle of your life. Its who is going to run out of mana first. If you kill one you won't be able to kill the other 3 before the first one is back. it's stupid. When BG's go the time limit or arenas go on for 20+ min battles it should shoot up a red flag. 90% of the time it's not bad players it's bad design and unbalance.</div></div><hr />

Druids have virtually no cooldown to help the tank out and with the change to mastery are the weakest single tank healer. the questions above briefly mentioned they want all healing classes to be equal in terms of tank healing and all easily heal the tank. druids are still very weak now with healing the tank and have to use excessive mana to do so. all of this and the fact that we have no CD to help the tank makes us the weakest tank healers. Blizzard, are you listening?<br />
<br />
I don't quite get this whine.<br />
<br />
Druids which actually heal a tank actually do a surprising amount of healing between Lifebloom and Rejuv, cycled with the straight heals.<br />
Of course, you need to get out of the raid-spam mentality for this.<br />
<br />
Another issue:<br />
You don't need a tank-CD. Trust me, you don't. It actually genuinely doesn't matter who got a tank CD, only what # of them your raid has. The same reason Shamans don't need Tranquility, and Holy Priests don't need PW Barrier.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that you're complaining about something you haven't even tried, or you'd know it's very much legit. Problem is that the raidhealing of a Druid is so through the roof that no one in their right mind would let a RDruid heal a tank unless you got no alternatives.</div></div><hr />

Because it isn't obvious at all. But I suspect you don't really care to get deep enough into it to understand that, do you? ;)<br />
<br />
Then to keep it short: Druids heal more raw output, but it cannot be inferred, due to a combination of how Tranq works with how HoTs work with how the healing setup currently is, that they are overpowered as a result of it. It can be guessed, but so far we have no way of &quot;proving&quot; it, partially because we don't know how to assign &quot;Balance Points&quot; to a spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How are resto shamans not a viable pve choice? I think you need to sit down and re-evaluate what you are doing on your shaman if you feel that is the case. Don't go by what some guild that your not even in does. I raid 10's on my resto shaman and don't seem to have any true issues. I may be below our druid heals most of the time, but druids are just OP healers anyways (a lot of their healing are overheals). But I have also been healing on her since Wrath- accepted and adapted to the changes during Cata and I do just fine. Then again, you must have been one of those guys during wrath that depended solely on riptide and chain heal.<br />
<br />
The main thing I wish shamans had (and this could probably be applied to other classes) are more mobility type spells. Sure, we have spiritwalkers grace but it's on- what a 2/3 minute cooldown? We can riptide, but that has a small cooldown. Nature's swiftness? Cast once on a 2 minute cooldown. Druids can HoT on the move and disc has the merry go round PoM and can throw out shields (on top of the occasional renew).<br />

Yeah, I could see how they work that one in. Probably lose like a whole 1 percent dps for standing in fire. Though if they did this intelligently- it would be like a stacking debuff- lose 1% dps for every second you stand in the fire. Could you imagine the cry fest on the forums over that one?</div></div><hr />

That you have issues even thinking of it's 2-minute CD kinda tells me you never really went out to understand SWG.<br />
It's an amazing ability. And no, I don't feel (for PvE) that I need more mobility, between Riptide, NS, UL and SWG I got plenty of it. At least I never have the issue that my movement kills someone. And for PvP, well, we're already way strong there without extra mobility.</div></div><hr />

Whether or not the person you replied to is inept at resto healing (what a thing to say, judging someone without knowing him; but hey, I guess that's internet anonimity at finest) does not matter. No need to resort to argumentum ad hominem. He still brings up a good point. It doesn't matter WHO got the CD, as long as you have it. It's not a game balanced around solo play.</div></div><hr />

The raid will still wipe either way.<br />
<br />
For example, let's assume the best scenario and say that in a future raid, standing in the fire gives you a debuff that completely locks you out for 30 seconds; sounds very punishing at first, but it's the same result as if you had died (0 DPS). Instead of the DPS just dying due to standing in the fire, they are alive but useless.<br />
<br />
Net result: raid still hits the boss enrage and wipes due to lack of DPS.

I think that is the point.. when the raid wipes, and the raid leader goes over the stats and sees someone doing 50% dps, that player who stood in fire and got the debuff will be the one blamed. The way it works now is a lot of dps will stand in fire for a few extra seconds if it means pushing their dps up (knowing the healer will heal them).. this causes the healer to have to focus on them, and maybe run out of mana at the end of the fight... The problem is, if that dps is one of your top dps guys.. as a raid leader, you are going to overlook the ´little´extra damage they took because in a 5 minute fight, you won´t be able to tell that it is what stressed the healers and caused the ultimate wipe. Either the raid leader will look at the healers for failing at the end of the fight, or blame the ´low´dps guys who got out of the fire and cut off their rotations but saved the healer´s mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is a nice thought and everything, but if you are doing your job as DPS then you can do high damage and get out of stuff. 50% dps because you are doing the fight mechanics? please. More like 95% dps.</div></div><hr />

As soon as I switch to shadow for example, I see a lot more of the game, I can tab through the targets and do my thing, without ever looking at any bars at any given time.They should really work on that aspect and give healers more time to look at the whole screen instead of a corner with raid/party frames.</div></div><hr />

We’d rather augment other tools, or add new ones, if it appears that Shaman healing is inadequate for particular situations. stupid blizzard I hate your sucked any plans <br />
10 man raids isn't &quot;particular situations&quot; ??<br />
If Chain heal is situational spell, Healing rain is situational spell, which spell I have to use for healing raid ?? GREAT Healing Wave ?? ok, i use it often in 10m, but where is my mana ? return it somehow !!<br />
Rdruids always spam Wild Growth and Rejuv(in 25m and 10m), Priests spam Circle of Healing and PoH or PW:Shield, why stupid developers don't want Resto shamans always can use Chain Heal for raid healing ??? <br />
ok, if Chain heal is situational spell and often can't be used in 10 man, why it weaker in Hps than WG and CoH ??? <br />
Why ?Why ?Why ?Why ?Why ?Why ?Why ?Why ?Why ?Why ?Why ?Why ? <br />
<br />
only one answer I have for all &quot;why&quot; is because they hate Chain heal and using CH by Resto shamans</div></div><hr />

That's about the dumbest thing I've ever read. Their throughput is ridiculous also. Are we even playing the same game?<br />
<br />
I dunno if YOU are on the same page, but I never said they were bad guy, but I also don't think they are 'op' and need the nerfbat. <br />
What I am explaining to you, (though I can't even begin to fathom why), is that b/c resto druids do not have a damage reduction, they have more throughput. Understand? That's what druids have. Don't get all pissy at me due to mechanics, that's just how it is right now. If that's the dumbest thing you've ever read, you ain't been around here for long, have you?</div></div><hr />

Whether or not the person you replied to is inept at resto healing (what a thing to say, judging someone without knowing him; but hey, I guess that's internet anonimity at finest) does not matter. No need to resort to argumentum ad hominem. He still brings up a good point. It doesn't matter WHO got the CD, as long as you have it. It's not a game balanced around solo play.<br />
<br />
To you and all other druids, this was in 4.1 that you might have missed &quot;Malfurion's Gift now reduces the cooldown of Tranquility by 2.5/5 minutes.&quot;<br /> 
<br />
That's it, that's all you're getting, that was your 'additional cooldown' a 3 minute Tranquility, meaning tranquility can be used multiple times in a single fight and that it will be up every fight, and since Tranquility is a pretty decent cooldown (especially in 10mans) that's a good boost to your cooldown power.<br />
<br />
If you're still waiting around for another cooldown you're going to be waiting a long long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, there are a few things that bug me. Blizz nerfed our Mana Tide, but attempted to balance the nerf with a mana-per-crit mechanic. Which in general is OK, but it has some significant issues. First, this mechanic is tied to Water Shield. In the same patch, Blizz made just about anything proc water shield. Which is bad, because when the shield is down, we get no passive regen and no crit regen (and the mana we get for a proc is tiny, too). The fire birds before Alyxrazor is a good example of this: my water shield disappears in literally 2 or 3 seconds, for no discernible reason. Second, we get no mana return for casting Healing Rain -- which costs a ton of mana to maintain, and is absolutely mandatory on the AoE damage phases of bosses like Majordomo and Ragnaros. <br />
<br />
Honestly, the biggest issue I have with my shaman is that I don't feel like I have a lot of control over my mana. On my Druid, in considerably less gear, I can spam quite a lot before getting into mana issues. Granted, solo tank healing feels way, way better on my Shaman, but for everything else, I'd rather use my Druid (too bad my guild has a glut of good resto druids). <br />
<br />
As an aside: while Spirit Link totem has some amazing situational uses (e.g. Ragnaros p2), it's not that great of a reactionary tank cooldown. It has a 10 yard range (and is dropped randomly somewhere 2-3 yards near you), so you need to be almost on top of your tank to use it. Even then, it only reduces incoming damage by 10% (plus the health balancing every second or so, of course). This is great if you know the damage is coming, but if you don't (e.g. a tank is randomly spiked too low), it's worthless. Which is why I somewhat object to calling it a &quot;tank&quot; cooldown.</div></div><hr />

that would be sweet as hell</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nobodysbaby</div><div class="date">2011-07-18, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been waiting for many weeks now to get all those questions about Holy Priest answered, but I was oh so disappointed... There are MANY questions left without any answer. <br />
<br />
1. They say Holy Priests are well represented in raids - complete lie? Looking at all logs we are by far the least used healer for raids, both normals and especially heroics since we bring nothing to the oh-so-important-raid CD's except pure healing, wich Druids do so much better (even Holy Palas outshine us many times with all their CD's). I already went Disc on most of our encounters just because the benefit from mitigation is simply too important. I never enjoyed Disc style of healing, but atm I have to go Disc for the sake of my guild. Often we run with zero Holy Priests. We have a buggy GS, but there are already so many other classes bringing better tank CD's out there, even the tanks themselves.<br />
<br />
2. There is a true lack of communication - all we hear is &quot;we think Holy Priests are good because they have such a large toolbox&quot;. Maybe it is time to evaluate just how useful this toolbox really is?<br />
<br />
3. There are (I think a record) huge amount of forum threads still not answered why there are no Spirit cloth drops from bosses; why we are the only ones missing Spirit on our &quot;off-pieces&quot; while all other classes have plenty, and I want Blizzard to acknowledge how it feels for raiding Priests seing all other classes get their upgrades from bosses and especially Holy can't even consider non-spirit items as an upgrade, and don't want to &quot;take&quot; the guilds dps-gears etc. We are simply being treatened different than everybody else here, and ofc we don't like it...<br />
<br />
If you think we should just respecc Disc and be happy with that you are making a big mistake. Disc and Holy is as similar to playing a Druid vs Holy Paladin, and I for once (and I know many others) didn't choose Holy as MS and stay happy with going Disc on the majority of fights.<br />
<br />
More feedback coming, time to go to work.</div></div><hr />
