Cloud Serpents Mount Video Preview<br />
The Cloud Serpents are definitely the most popular mount in MIsts of Pandaria so far and I finally found the time to make a real preview of the mount with actual, in-game footage. I also added a couple of raw footage for all the recolors for those of you who want to spend a little more time inspecting one specific color. <br />

Mists of Pandaria Dynamic Quest Rewards<br />
One of the interesting change made to leveling in the expansion is the quest rewards. In Mists of Pandaria, quests no longer have predetermined rewards and they have been replaced with dynamic rewards depending on which class you're playing.<br />
<br />
For example, this is the rewards for the first horde quest of the expansion, from the point of view of 3 different classes. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Each class gets a different weapon, and hybrid classes get to choose between multiple weapons based on their specialization. You don't have to run a bunch of quests that won't give you anything useful for your plate tanking gear, and you don't have to spend forever trying to figure out where you can get an upgrade for your weapon! <br />
<br />
In the case of this quest, this is all the possible weapon rewards you could get:<br />

<br />
Of course the system could get much more interesting as leveling progresses, with instance quests always rewarding you with an useful blue item for your specialization, etc ... <br />

Death Strike Healing not Working<br />
There is a bug that prevents Death Strike from healing at all at the moment on beta. This is the kind of thing we should be able to hotfix.

Monks Aren't Fun to Level<br />
There are apparently some bugs in what levels monks get certain abilities. There should not be big level gaps in any class until you start hitting the 50s.<br />
<br />
Overall, classes should still get new abilities at about the same rate they always did. We shifted some around to where they would make more sense (e.g. Shadow priests need some heals, but not nearly as many as a Disc priest) but those gaps are made up for by old talents that are no spec-specific spells. Using priests as an example again, all Holy priests get Chakra instead of having to spend a (no-brainer) talent point on them.<br />
<br />
Feedback on specific monk abilities is appreciated. We just didn't want you to blame the talent changes for an apparent lack of abilities.

<br />
Chi Wave<br />
The design of Chi Wave is that it jumps from hostile to friendly to hostile to friendly and so on. It prefers the closest target, and in the next build will try to perfer players over pets and guardians. The way we use it internally is to cast it on the tanks, which causes it to hit the boss, and then back to the tank and so on. We agree missing is pretty punitive, but I believe Mistweavers don't yet have the Spirit to hit conversion mechanic of healers.

Monk Feedback<br />
Thanks for the feedback, everyone. Monks are a new class, and we will be iterating on them quite a bit and often we change mechanics a lot faster than we make beta builds. With that in mind, we wanted to clarify our design intent on some of the abilities:<br />
<br />
Dizzying Haze -- We increased the threat and lowered the energy. We're not crazy about making it do damage because then it risks competing with other Brewmaster abilities. We really don't want Dizzying Haze used rotationaly on single-targets. We also run into whether or not the ability should break CC if it does damage.<br />
<br />
AE tanking -- We agree that monks need a little more ability to cleave.<br />
<br />
Missing Jabs -- It isn't intended to lose all Energy on a miss. We will fix that. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219841-monk-brewmaster-feedback/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4254456892?page=2#22))<br />

Protection Paladin Design<br />
You shouldn't have to &quot;wait to do things&quot; much. The Protection rotation should include Avenger's Shield, Crusader Strike, Judgment, Consecration and Holy Wrath, with Shield of the Righteous and Word of Glory as finishers. You should almost always have a button to push. We don't have a problem with occasional holes in the rotation, so long as those don't occur with frustrating regularity.

Lava Lash Tooltip Error<br />
Lava Lash does still spread Flame Shock, but the tooltip was, strangely, updated and no longer say it spreads Flame Shock.<br />
Yes, this is just a tooltip error. The design intent is that Lava Lash spreads Flame Shock.<br />
<br />
There is a minor glyph that lets you turn the Flame Shock spread off (which is sometimes useful to shaman), but the tooltip appears as if you always have the glyph even when you do not.

Warlock Tanking<br />
Just to make our intent clear, the Glyph of Demon Hunting isn't intended to turn Demonology warlocks into a tanking spec. You won't be able to queue as a tank for Dungeon Finder for instance and won't have the survivability or tools of say a Protection paladin.<br />
<br />
Historically, warlocks felt tankier than other casters and could even off-tank some encounters. We have made an effort in Mists to recapture some of that flavor. A warlock with this glyph should feel like they are about as effective tanking as an Arms warrior who pulls out a shield and swaps to Defensive Stance, or a Feral druid who goes into Bear form. You might be able to off-tank adds or pick up an actual boss for a short period of time if the tank goes down.<br />
<br />
To make warlocks an actual tank would take more significant changes. For example, we want tanks to have to pick up separate tanking gear than their DPS gear (this is even true of druids) and want tanks to have to give up some of their DPS potential in exchange for their survivability. In short, it needs to be a commitment, and that's the sort of thing that needs larger gameplay changes than just a glyph.<br />
<br />
That shouldn't stop the glyph of Demon Hunting from being fun though. As you can probably tell, we are trying to make even the major glyphs more about character customization and fun. <br />
<br />
As some of you have pointed out, the glyph of Demon Hunting in your beta build doesn't deliver on what I described above as the design. The newer version of the glyph, hopefully available in the next beta build, allows a warlock to toggle in and out of the off-tank / survival mode, more like the druid going Bear or the warrior going Defensive.<br />
<br />
The new shapeshift granted by the glyph is called Threatening Presence (PH) and adds Taunt and Fury Ward to the normal Metamorphosis toolkit. You still get the damage reduction from mastery instead of the damage boost from mastery while in this form. You can also choose to go into normal Metamorphosis even if you have the glyph. Let us know how it feels.<br />
<br />
We appreciate all the feedback and passion on this topic. We expected this glyph would serve a pretty niche community and were surprised at how many players were excited about it. We are still in beta and are still very much experimenting with what kind of gamplay we can deliver in glyphs.

<br />
Warlock Fire<br />
So we’ve obtained some additional insight about what exactly lies behind the use of the word “hope” in regard to our efforts to achieve green fire for warlocks. Essentially, we want this updated information out so that we can better manage expectations, especially as the announcement created such a flurry of excitement.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, dear warlocks, those of you who retained a modicum of skepticism were right to, as it would seem that the chance of green fire for warlocks is even less as likely as the wording of the original information indicated. <br />
<br />
Since spell effects are not as simple to change around as — for example — druid forms are, we need some additional technology implemented in order to allow the use of red or green fire to be a player choice and not a permanent change that is put in place for all warlocks.<br />
<br />
Also, technology aside, we want to do the introduction of something like green fire in the right way. Implementing it in “a quest” doesn’t really explain our stance here. We want something as substantial as this change to be an epic accomplishment for you.<br />
<br />
So though we have definitely heard your thoughts on the matter, and we’ve explained what we want to do from our side, green fire will not be available with the launch of Mists of Pandaria. And we haven’t a timeframe to commit to, or communicate about, at this stage.<br />
<br />
It is with regret that we were unable to clarify these details more when we first mentioned our intent — “our hope” — and we wish we hadn’t caused such excitement and raised expectations for those that didn’t instantly take the news with an “I’ll believe it when I see it” pinch of salt. It seems, as many of us said at the time here and on Twitter and fansites, the proof of the (green fire) pudding really was in the eating. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219525-warlock-fire/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2986309301?page=4#73))<br />

Protection Warrior Design<br />
We wanted to clarify a little the direction we are trying to go with Protection warriors and ultimately all tanks.<br />
<br />
You generate rage through auto attacks. You also have some sources of rage more under your control, such as shouts, Charge, and in particular Shield Slam (the same is true of MS or BT if you are Arms or Fury). You no longer generate rage from taking damage, because we found that it basically meant Prot warriors always had infinite rage, so the resource wasn't relevant to gameplay. We think classes are more fun and interesting when they have to manage, even to a small extent, some resource.<br />
<br />
For Protection, we expect you to spend most of your rage on Shield Block. Shield Block is not an emergency button. It generally won't save your life. But this is a good thing. Emergency buttons with resource costs aren't reliable. On the other hand using Shield Block (or Shield Barrier for magic damage) will make a difference over the course of a fight. It will help your healers out. It will slightly blunt spikes. Shield Block has no cool down, allowing you to use it more frequently when you have lots of rage, but also letting you play a little with when you use it. If you know a big hit is coming soon, you can delay the block for a few seconds. Otherwise, you can use it, knowing you'll have rage soon for another one.<br />
<br />
One of the changes for old time Prot warriors is getting used to not spamming Heroic Strike. Think of HS (and Cleave) as an alternative to Shield Block for times when you don't need to worry about blocking, such as when you are soloing, off-tanking or doing easy content. If you use too many Heroic Strikes, you won't have rage for Shield Block as well. Your other attacks, Devastate, Revenge, Shield Slam and Thunder Clap, should fill in most of the holes in your rotation and should be sufficient for holding threat without HS spam.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned recently, Prot warrior damage is probably 50% of where it needs to be. When we have that adjusted, your threat will be higher and those Shield Slam and Revenge hits in particular should feel meatier.<br />
<br />
If you are a Guardian Druid, there are a lot of analogues. Notice what costs rage, and don't spend it on the wrong things. If you are a Prot paladin, spend your Holy Power mostly on Shield of the Righteous (in this case for damage and mitigation). If you are a Blood DK, your rotation isn't that different than it is on live.<br />
<br />
We will ultimately balance all of the tanks around their suite of survival mechanics. Just be aware that we balance based on typical group situations and not how long a tank can go without getting a heal. If a tank can be two shot by a boss (assuming appropriate gear and skill), it's a design problem. If a tank is getting four or five shot, it's a healer problem.<br />
<br />
P.S. Standard caveat that our design intent here is to make things more fun overall, not to nerf anybody. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219877-protection-warriors-rage/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4253971713?page=2#27))<br />
<br />
Thunder Clap<br />
TC's attack power scaling was removed. It is gone.<br />
That doesn't sound like something we would document. Do you remember where you saw it? In any case, it isn't accurate. Thunder Clap has a 0.456 attack power coefficient. We cleaned up a lot of melee tooltips to remove &quot;scales with attack power&quot; because it is pretty much always true. We don't say for Flash Heal &quot;scales with spell power.&quot; It's just superfluous.<br />
<br />
There is a general problem where Protection warrior damage is much too low across the board. That is something we are working on. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219850-warrior-thunder-clap-concerns/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4253901658#7))<br />

New Quest Reward System<br />
Offering quest rewards this way is a change for us, and the kind of thing for which we could definitely use feedback. <br />
<br />
For the players that level as X spec but want to also collect gear as Y spec, we have a few solutions:<br />
<br />
<br />
Several of the zones have vendors with decent gear that isn't quite at the quest item level. These help provide coverage if you miss a reward, say gloves or shoulders, since questing is less linear now. However, these vendors also help you gather off-spec gear.<br />
Several quests, especially those that offer blue rewards, weapons, trinkets and most of the level 90 quests, offer you a choice of gear for all of your specs instead of just your current spec.<br />
Because the questing in zones isn't as linear as Cataclysm, and because there are two zones per level in some cases, you'll have the option to hit some quests as spec A and some quests as spec B.<br />
There are still other sources of gear, such as crafting, the AH, dungeons, faction rep and so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also remember that if, for example, you level as Arms but want to tank a few dungeons as Protection, that the level-up dungeons are not so brutally difficult that you need full tanking gear. A Prot warriors in DPS Strength gear would do just fine. As you get into endgame content, especially normal raids, you'll want actual tanking gear. <br />
<br />
We don't players to have to feel like they should do this. Keep in mind that you would need to be pretty min-max focused to agonize over whether you want the healing or the DPS legs when you'll probably get a new set of legs in an hour or two. It starts to matter more as you get closer to level 90 and the rate of upgrade slows down, but as I said, you'll generally get options on those quests.

Tiller Farm<br />
A little snippet of information for you: your farm will be visible only to yourself. So nobody's going to come by and poach your crops... or, I guess, water your plants while you're away! <br />
<br />
I’m a warrior who has hunted down dragons and demons, so why would I go work on a farm?<br />
As with anything in the game, the idea is if it's not for you, you can leave it and concentrate on other things. One of the themes you might have noticed in Mists of Pandaria is that we're trying to ensure a range of fun options. Hopefully you can pick and choose which ones interest you and focus on them. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/219737-farms/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3553415889#9))<br />
<br />
Cooking Changes<br />
So you might have heard for Cooking in Mists of Pandaria we will have specializations. At the moment we're looking at around 5 branches of cooking, for example: broiling, steaming...etc.<br />
<br />
Each of these specializations will focus on a particular stat. So let's say the Steaming specialization allows you to create Agility food. A rogue would find that very interesting, and would probably want to max that one out first. At which point, said rogue would be able to create Agility buff feasts for groups. Cool, huh? But worry not, once you max out in one specialization, you can then work on the other specializations.<br />
<br />
Maybe they're gonna make it take ages to fully train all of them.<br />
Well, maybe not ages. But it does mean that until enough time passes for you to train all specializations, you need to—er—specialize. Actually it's the way for other crafting professions too. For example, my jewelcrafter specialized in spell related stat recipes first, since of all my multitude of alts, I prefer my casters. Eventually, of course, she learned many more recipes and of course so did other crafters, so the market changed.

<br />
Lilian Voss<br />
In Mists of Pandaria, we finally catch up with Lilian Voss. For those who didn't play through the Forsaken starting experience, Lilian Voss was brought back to life by Sylvanas, but despite this she refused to become part of the Forsaken.<br />
<br />
After trying to re-connect with her still living father, those players with keen eyes might have noticed her handiwork in Western Plaguelands. As a non-aligned &quot;free agent,&quot; Lilian has some surprising hidden talents. In Mists of Pandaria she's still confused about her situation. Still broiling with internal conflict, despising what she has become.<br />
<br />
Now she has a new and grander mission in mind and it revolves around Scholomance and Darkmaster Gandling in particular. She wants to ensure that like herself, no others shall be raised from death and subjugated.

DoTA Style Battleground as a Potential E-sport<br />
The biggest problem with releasing this battleground is that it requires some new tech, however we would very much love to be able to release the DotA-style Battleground during the Mists of Pandaria Life cycle.<br />
<br />
Regarding this particular battleground becoming an eSport, I see that as all depending on the community and the support that it is given. I personally would love to see more World of Warcraft eSports, I find myself spending loads of time watching streams and videos of arena and rated battlegrounds...they are ridiculously entertaining!

<br />
Outland update.<br />
Especially in comparison to the revamped 1-60 experience, we feel the pacing of Outland is a bit awkward at the moment. This is something we might try and work on.<br />
<br />
Having Wrath as the weakest link in the chain? Not so bad, in my opinion.<br />
And in our opinion too. Well, no... we don't think Wrath content is weak, we spent a lot of time lovingly crafting that place. In fact, we don't think it needs as many adjustments as perhaps Outland does, if any.<br />
<br />
I'd rather they just reworked the leveling experience to not include Outland anymore<br />
Well it might be more feasible to re-work the 1-60 content to avoid Outland (or Northrend) if it was &quot;just&quot; to skip 5 levels of content. But we don't want to somehow try to stretch 1-60 to cover 10 extra levels, let alone 20.

Circumvention of Battleground Balancing Measures via Addons<br />
This is not something that we are encouraging, but it is also something that we currently have no realistic way to prevent. That being said, this is something that may change soon, which is why we always advise people to not use any type of add-on designed to circumvent or bend our balancing safeguards... using such add-ons can lead to severe account penalties!

<br />
Horde not as Appealing to Female Gamers<br />
To answer the question in the title, I think the majority of responses in this thread show that female gamers like to play Horde characters just as much as Alliance. It's purely down to personal taste.<br />
<br />
I play a nice range of characters across both factions, and I feel the options available for each side match the spirit of the faction. Any 'pretty' missing for Horde females was more than made up for when blood elves joined back in TBC, and goblins are adorable!<br />
<br />
Having said that, what changes would you all like to see to the models to make them more appealing to play, besides those already mentioned?

What are you complaining about? That they decide to implement features that have been tested and generally liked?

I died a bit inside after reading it...<br />
<br />
Since I vendor almost all of my quest rewards I could really care less what they are as long as they get me a lot of gold. There never really was a problem with getting quest rewards you needed you just had to do more quests until yours popped up. Now they can have less quests with vendor trash if they want since all of you slots will be covered faster. Also plate classes will make more gold questing. I would rather they just left it the way it was.</div></div><hr />

I'm disappointed in the fact that people have been asking for (one example picked randomly out of my laundry list of AMG WHY DID IT TAKE SO LONG TO ADD THIS things) AOE looting for a long time &quot;Gee i wish it was easier to loot these hundred mobs I just killed while farming&quot;, but it took another game to have it in it before Blizzard decides &quot;OH HEY WE SHOULD LOOK AT THAT AOE LOOTING THING&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say it like the ideas are laying around and they ignore it until someone decides to put it on a game...<br />
Blizz does have a ton of ideas and the MMO market grabs stuff from wow all the time. If it's a good idea, why not implement it in your own game as well?<br />

<br />
That's exactly what I'm saying. Blizzard likely does have a ton of ideas, but they don't add it to the game until another company/game tries it out first and tests the water. It's too much of a coincidence that they added things people have been asking for for awhile to the game (aoe looting/class specific quest rewards being the two that are the most recent) after another mmo launched with those features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The problem is that it removes choice. Sure, many people will want to take the gear that's best suited for their current spec, but not everyone will. How are Healers supposed to gather gear (to be able to go and heal a dungeon), if they only receive gear for their dps spec? That's how it works: you only get gear for your current spec. Naturally, everyone quests as DPS, so if I'm Enhancement and try to collect gear for Resto, I get only more and more Agi gear, no Int.<br />
<br />
Also, some people might want to collect good looking gear that isn't their spec or even armor class. I know many people who like to collect beautiful robes or interesting offhands like a torch, even if they're plate wearers, for example. Or a rogue might want to choose a +Int leather kilt for Transmog.<br />
<br />
Lastly (the least important point imho, but important for many people), we all know that plate items sell for far more gold than the other armor class items, especially cloth. So if a plate wearer gets lots of plate gear through questing while I only get cloth gear, he's likely gonna make 3-4x as much gold as I am. That is unfair.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: the best solution would be to either highlight the recommended item (as if it was a proc), or to be able to toggle this automatic reward thing on or off in the interface section, as you can do with auto-looting for example.</div></div><hr />

What happened to the Dragon Aspects of Air, Fire and Water (aka the other elemental Dragon Aspects)? They resided and protect Pandaria. The new Dragon Mounts are from the 3 elemental Aspects broods. Turns out that they began to distance themselves from the other Aspects in Wyrmrest Accord because they sensed the growing corruption in Neltharion (DeathWing) and the other aspects (especially Alexstrasza) continuously ignored their warnings. So when Neltharion (DeathWing) wanted to created the Dragon Soul, the 3 other elemental Aspects refused saying that the final Elemental Aspect, the Aspects of Earth, Neltharion (DeathWing) was indeed corrupted by the Old Gods and claiming that the Dragon Soul was a trap. Because of this the other Aspects turn against the Air, Fire and Water Aspects for abandoning Azeroth in its time of need. But it was pointless since the 3 Aspects had already left Kalimdor and traveled with their mortal charges, the Pandarians (who always followed their led, rather than the other aspects) to the isle that would one day be called Pandaria. Using their powers the 3 Aspects of Air, Water and Fire hid the isle in shroud of mists. Only now with the destructive power of the Cataclysm has their protective cover been broken.</div></div><hr />

Sadly, it doesn't.

But that's the point of this new system, why would you need to sell anything? the gear the quest gives will be usable by your character.. so the days of picking up gear you can never use and selling it from quests would be gone.

herp derp... that thing is an addon. Here's how its done: enable addon/disable addon. Is that much of a farcry for Blizzard to build it in into UI? That's hardly more complex than death knight vioce on/off. Are you telling me something like that is complex and resource heavy?<br />

this was my thought as well when i first saw the 372 1400 dps 2hander. in previous expansion launches our old gear lasted us at least a little while. now it looks like the first few quests we complete will replace all of our gear. looks like i was justified in taking time off until MoP launches. this would have drove me crazy if i had wasted all of that time farming deathwing.</div></div><hr />

It's because they bumped all of the weapon damage (incl. current Cata weapons) by a factor of 2.<br />
The first items you get in MoP are ilvl 372, so they're just below HoT stuff. Stuff from the first 5-man is 425 however, so that one could replace quite a lot of gear :)</div></div><hr />

Are you telling me something like that is complex and resource heavy?<br />
<br />
you don't get it, do you? with that addon, every warlock you see in the game will have a green fire. meanwhile they want the client to show different spell effects, with normal fire for warlocks who don't have that glyph.</div></div><hr />

Changing the color is beyond their technical ability? Two questions 1) Why aren't all spell effects the same color then? 2) Why are there already green fire spell effects of the exact same spells that Warlocks have being used by mobs in game now?<br />
<br />
The problem is more likely that they cant change the spell animation/color by adding a glyph. They want to make it a choice, wether you want green fire or not, should be a player decision - thats their current plan.<br />
<br />
I think, IF they'd add glyph, it would've to remove the normal ability and add a version with green fire instead. If you understand. :)<br />

The dynamic quest reward thing is pretty awesome, but at the same time...I liked having quests that didn't give me anything I could use, it was nice playing a mage, getting an axe for a quest reward and vendoring it for 25g.<br />
<br />
So, you'll probably get a staff you could sell..<br />
<br />

It sure is, all tho i prefer something that is free, Skype that is.<br />

For one thing I can think of is enchanting materials. I think with this new system they're going to make a lot less quests that reward gear, because if all gear was useful and they continued to give out gear on pretty much 90% of the quests you'd have a full set in before you even got out of the first quest hub! There's no way they'll do that. So that's bad for enchanters who decide to mop up old quests for mats...there simply won't be as many items.<br />
<br />
Plus I think they're going to have to normalize the vendor price of gear. If a paladin or warrior is getting nothing but plate, which has always vendored for the most gold, they have a significant advantage over a mage, and the mage no longer even has the option to choose the plate anymore. The only fair way would be to normalize prices...i.e. a 372 chestpiece vendors for X amount regardless of whether it's cloth, leather, mail, or plate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you choose that glyph to be different. or maybe you don't, and then everyone else is running with greenfire, but you're special. either way, its about choice. whats the point of having green fire if everyone else have it as well? and what if you, unlike everyone else, don't want it to be green? bear in mind we're not talking about some addon anymore, that you can turn on/off as you please. its about blizzard making permanent change to the game so that everyone have it, or we wait till they sort tech things out.<br />
<br />
ofc, they could probably add some interface option, just for warlocks.. but then again, that won't make you any special than this lvl12 warlock just out of the elwynn forest.<br />
<br />
and I disagree with you about same gear and people not giving a damn about it. not so long ago, I've been asked to change our guild tabard a little, just so it could match that guy's gear set (transmogrified or whatever that word is) even more. and we're not some RP crazy nerds guild. I see quite often people who prefer to change appearance of their gear to something simple, like lowlevel leather sets for hunters. its kinda cool.</div></div><hr />

Your cognitive dissonance annoys me. Sure it is easy to make warlock fire look green to you but noboday else by editing your game files, and it is easy for all warlock fire to look green to everyone through a patch.<br />
However, making some warlock's fire to look green and some look red and having that dynamically switchable to everyone throug a glyph is not as simple. I personally, think all warlock's should have green fire. Bliz thinks players should have a choice. Bliz is probably correct.

<br />
The only exception is that swtor also give &quot;commendations&quot; (via mob loot drop or quests) for each region/planet to buy some stuff from the specific vendors. They sell better than average stuff for that level range, a few basic &quot;mods&quot; (like wow gems/enchants) to improve your gear and some random boe stuff (to sell if you want to since you can farm the commendations with the daily group quests).</div></div><hr />

That's what that addon was for. Sure the player that enabled it saw other Warlocks also having a green fire but if the point was his warlock and not others then what's the problem? Once agian it comes to blizz not being the hero and being a party pooper about it. They are probably wrong on this one. If someone insists on postponing and baning others from having what they want just because that someone wasnt the one who gived them that what they desire, then quite frankly that someone is simply a dick... regardless of what EULA says.

Regarding the quest rewards im not for this idea at all,because the one way a solo player makes alot of money is through selling random gear he gets from quest rewards,if were getting the gear we need constantly then it just means we are gona be changing gear all the time looking at stats 24/7 and the gear is going to become a chore eventually.</div></div><hr />

Well I kinda see where they are coming from with this one. Look at it this way:<br />
If they would implement every awesome feature like this in every patch they would have less to showcase on new expansions. They are making a great bluff with this btw... they make it seem like it comes with MoP but in reality it comes with update to 5.0 to which everyone will have access to. Still lots of people are not aware of that or they do know but dont give a lot of thought about it and makes MoP all the more exciting. If they wouldn't mention updates such as these next to MoP then all MoP would bring in is new class, new quests, new raids, new zones, few new systems... thats it.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong im not sponsored by mumble nor do i work for the company or anything like that but it is, by a considerably margin, by far the best voip.<br />
<br />
Ive always viewed Ventrilo as a &quot;pug voip&quot; on the basis that it seemed like the &quot;standard&quot; program to use, and because of its popularity (because of how old it it) most people have got it and it essentially speeds things up when it comes to pugging, but with the absolutely awful interface, lack of volume normalisation, no overlay and pretty poor latency i would NEVER use it for my guild raids.<br />

I'd never heard of mumble then i spotted that Paragon, Vodka and Method had a feature on their UI showing who was talking which caused me to research the program, its only 40mb, it normalises everyone so they speak at the same volume, the sound quality is absolutely superb and the latency is practically non existant. The servers cost less too! My only gripe with mumble is it takes literally about a minute to load up, but with the way wow loading screens are at the moment this isn't really an issue.<br />
<br />
If you use TS3 or Ventrilo in your guild raids at the moment and your a bit fed up with the &quot;AAAHJHG GIUYSH SHTACK THE FOOCK UPP&quot; shound quality and haven't got a clue who is talking half the time i really, really recommend you give it a go, its absolutely superb. Im fortunate that on my server, EU-Darksorrow, most people who are decent have discovered this and use mumble aswell.</div></div><hr />

I've tried the beta abit and sure the mobs have insane ammount of hp (new expack lol) but judgement crits (depending on seal ofc) alot. I am mainly in ds 397 gear and 410 on my paladin and I can get pretty nice 16k + judgement crits.<br />
THey have also given us something called denounce which you are able to spam and it crits for roughly the same ammount, and it doesnt cost that much mana. With that said, I would say that MoP will be the xpac where healers can lvl with ease as healing spec. For paladins atleast anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was mostly in 264s when I hit Cata. I mostly didn't start replacing any gear until partway through Deepholm. Purples still carry a lot of extra stats that make them better than greens. Generally only heroic items from the last tier will last until close to the end. They're just trying to avoid a situation like in Wrath where people were tanking Naxx in mostly Sunwell gear. (Granted Naxx was easy, but doesn't excuse the old gear still being much better than the new stuff)</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong im not sponsored by mumble nor do i work for the company or anything like that but it is, by a considerably margin, by far the best voip.<br />
<br />
Ive always viewed Ventrilo as a &quot;pug voip&quot; on the basis that it seemed like the &quot;standard&quot; program to use, and because of its popularity (because of how old it it) most people have got it and it essentially speeds things up when it comes to pugging, but with the absolutely awful interface, lack of volume normalisation, no overlay and pretty poor latency i would NEVER use it for my guild raids.<br />
<br />

<br />
A good ts3 server can do those things as well though. I dont know about the price side of thigns though. My guild is a gameing syndicate, in that we paly across about 10 different games, and people are free to move from game to game, and we add and remove &quot;official games&quot; as new ones come out and older portals die out. It means that people can pretty easily move from game to game with people they know and enjoy playing with. As a result of this, we simply have our own hosted server that we rent and can run what ever we want on. It hosts TS, game servers for various games (FPS's, Minecraft, etc), our web site, and so on. We support the cost by every one paying $12 a year, and we hold a raffle every year around xmas with the leftovers, things like new egg gift cards. Getting back to the point, we host our own ts3 server that is very solid, low latency (hardly any delay when my GF talks in the same room as me and it comeing through ts), rarely goes down (cant think of the last time out side of scheduled maintenance), great voice quality, and huge capacity, we usualy have about 300+ people on for the xmas giveaway with no quality issues, we also have over 100 people on an average night (people from multiple portals in thier own channels). I know you can equalize players volume individualy pretty easily in TS3, though i dont know that it has an option to just set every one at once, never really needed to mess with that. The also use to be an overlay available for it, but i've never used it, so im not sure whats out there right now, though i know it works with the keyboards with built in screens. Add in whisper lists and commander features (not sure if mumble does those), and its pretty nice. Oh and it works with macs. Granted, when we want to pull pugs in, it can be an issue since they usualy dont have it and scoff at ts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not quite. There is nothing innovative about this. You can implement questing and be innovative (TOR, for example.) But to change your own quest rewards after years and years to follow a model that others have been doing for a few years now is a blatant rip off. It's like the first couple &quot;goth&quot; kids had an innovative style. Everyone who came afterward were following the trend....i.e. ripping them off.<br />
<br />
And I'd be more willing to accept the idea that they are flattering their competitors by stealing their ideas if it wasn't for the continued assault by higher ups in ActiBlizz ripping these other games. Or the continued assault from WoW fanboys about how these other games are &quot;WoW clones&quot; or &quot;WoW ripoffs&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your missing the issue entirely. The spell effect is tied to the spell, its not they cant change the color, its that they cant do so with a glyph easily or in a way that does'nt involve a bunch superfulus code, which is inefiecient from a programming stand point, something they have to be cautious of. It may also require changes across classes and possibly mobs as well. When you see the green fire from say a mob, its not casting the same spell in the database as your warlock is casting, it just may have the same name in the dispaly field, but the spell it self is a different entry.<br />
<br />
They could make the glyph remove the current spell from your spell book, and then give you a new idetical spell with the exception of the color, but then that can lead to having to make changes across the class for all sorts of other effects like procs and such that need to referance this new spell as well, not to mention twice the work when changes are made to it.<br />
<br />
they dont want to just give all warlocks green fire period because some warlocks might still want red fire. <br />
<br />
if you understand how programing and tables work, its easier to understand how it could be an issue for them if it wasn't something that was considered when the spell system was created in the first place. They can of course write new code, but as they say, its alot of time as it affects more than just warlocks, and that means man power and money. Yes they have alot of that, but its something they have to take away from work on something else they may consider more important at thist time. Its not like they have programmers just sitting around on the bench, they are working on things. And simply hireing more only to lay them off later when the work ammount goes down isnt a great plan either, and can lead to quality issues. Not to mention, even when you hire an experienced programmer, they have to learn the ins and outs of the engine before they can work on an overhall to a core system like this. <br />
<br />
So its not that its impossible, they dont say that, only that under the current system used, theres not a good or in thier view acceptable way to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
the issue is its modifying a game file so that the effect it looks for on your computer is edited to look for a file with the green version instead. I havnt seen said mod, but my guesse is that it effects ALL warlocks on your screen when they cast said spell, and not just your self. <br />
<br />
Editing the game files in this way has ben around for a long time, and when its done, it effects every one useing it from your POV, not just your self. For instance before blizzard made it so you couldnt do it, people edited the color of items such as dragon stalkers. It didnt just make your armor look black instead of purple, it made all dragon stalker armor look black instead of purple.<br />
<br />
totaly differnt than make it so that warlock x's fire is green, but warlock y's fire is red, and thats the way it looks to every one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is pretty much what I thought when seeing both AoE looting and this new class specific looting. Although this expansion has been in the works for a good year or so (it's not like they started developing right after SW:ToR came out or anything) but still, calling this all &quot;new&quot; makes me giggle a little. I'm sure there are TONS of other games out there that have either and or both of these options as well, but as SW:ToR is the biggest and most recent and as stated in a blue post last month a lot of the WoW dev team plays SW:ToR so it strikes me as funny that this is all &quot;new&quot; and &quot;flashy&quot; as far as anyone, including the blues are concerned. <br />
<br />
I know a lot of people (especially fanbois) like to bash SW:ToR but apparently they did something right seeing as WoW is putting a ton of things into their next expansion that is the same or at least mimics their latest competitor. I love them and play them both so it's really a luxury to have both my mmo's work relativity the same as far as basic mechanics go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are seeing things that didn´t happen the way you think.<br />
<br />
Blizzard implemented ´story mode´ raids in order to get more people into endgame content<br />
Immediately ´loot´ problems arose because need-greed just does not work with 25 strangers<br />
New Technology is developed that allows that identifies class and spec and their appropriateness for rolling need.<br />
The same technology is used for quests to identify your spec and offer you appropriate rewards.<br />
<br />
My guess is this change has more to do with tech becoming available because of LFR. Blizzard tends to do that a lot.. they develop a new tech and then find everywhere possible to add it.<br />
<br />
There are obviously 3 different issues that need to be addressed. The first being off-spec, the second being vendor sell prices and the third being RP and Transmorging.<br />
<br />
Honestly, even though I am personally hit by the off-spec thing.. I welcome this change because there was nothing worse than playing a low-gear spec like moonkin and seeing great, end-of chain blue quests not offering you any suitable rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Age of Conan had a large amount of voice overs also... it was as slow and boring in that game as it is in SWTOR. it was also in about 10,000 other non-mmorpg games before AOC.<br />
<br />
Voice-overs in a video game is not innovation. SWTOR is showing exactly why most MMORPGs don´t have voice-overs... there are simply too many quests, most of them actually pretty boring. Adding voice-overs does not make the quest less boring, it just makes ´getting´the quest much longer and painful.</div></div><hr />

Now that Blizz introduced a spec tag to the loot (solving the biggest complain in Raid Finder), why not use it to retrofit those quest rewards? Which is what I think they did. <br />
<br />
Now, the green fire issue. I may be wrong, but I can't remember a single spell effect that has a different look according to user preference (aside from mage's polymorph, but that isn't the kind of effect we're talking). Considering Wow's engine complexity, I assume that it's not a simple matter of having a flag and dupplicate spell effect files for each Warlock spell (and which they would have to keep in synch from now on to the end of Wow). It would also mean having different spell Ids, so the other players would see that you were using a different set of spell effects (otherwise, what would be the point of having it?), and/or changes to the underlying combat messages to accomodate that (which could potentialy break addons and internal features that rely on those messages). All that considered, if and when they put in the tech to give spells a distinct color, I suppose you will be able to pick specific colors for your fire, not only green. Black fire, anyone? =))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard implemented ´story mode´ raids in order to get more people into endgame content<br />
Immediately ´loot´ problems arose because need-greed just does not work with 25 strangers<br />
New Technology is developed that allows that identifies class and spec and their appropriateness for rolling need.<br />
The same technology is used for quests to identify your spec and offer you appropriate rewards.<br />
<br />
My guess is this change has more to do with tech becoming available because of LFR. Blizzard tends to do that a lot.. they develop a new tech and then find everywhere possible to add it.<br />
<br />
There are obviously 3 different issues that need to be addressed. The first being off-spec, the second being vendor sell prices and the third being RP and Transmorging.<br />
<br />
Honestly, even though I am personally hit by the off-spec thing.. I welcome this change because there was nothing worse than playing a low-gear spec like moonkin and seeing great, end-of chain blue quests not offering you any suitable rewards.<br />
<br />
What the hell are you talking about? Other games had this &quot;tech&quot; long before Blizzard decided to implement LFR. It's not &quot;new tech&quot;.<br />

Age of Conan had a large amount of voice overs also... it was as slow and boring in that game as it is in SWTOR. it was also in about 10,000 other non-mmorpg games before AOC.<br />
<br />
Voice-overs in a video game is not innovation. SWTOR is showing exactly why most MMORPGs don´t have voice-overs... there are simply too many quests, most of them actually pretty boring. Adding voice-overs does not make the quest less boring, it just makes ´getting´the quest much longer and painful.<br />
<br />
Then no game has created much as far as innovation, have they? We're not talking about regular video games, we're talking about MMOs and, no, AoC did NOT have this high level of voice over acting. And it only makes the quest much longer and painful to the short attention span crowd, such as yourself. Ones who wish they could space bar through the dialogue of any video game they play.<br />
<br />
Quite honestly, the fact that you would even considering lumping MMOs and regular console games together is completely ridiculous in and of itself.</div></div><hr />

Well that's fantastic. I know expansions always bridge the gap and all... but is it me or is this quite extreme? First quest I can toss all my epics in the water basically. Was it that extreme at Cata (I was on a break and got back later with a new account so never experienced that)? I mean, I guess I have to roll with it and heck, I will... just I expected the top Cata gear to last a bit further into the expansion than the very first quest xD<br />

How does a ilvl 372 green blow H-Gurth out of the water? It's barely better than H t11 gear? Maybe you should actually take a look before going off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there's a problem in balance between DPS &amp; Stats! Too much DPS, too few Agility (as for the others weapons)<br />
<br />
There's no problem between weapon dps &amp; stats, they're buffing weapon dps and nerfing the weapon dps percentage of abilities.<br />
<br />
So while it looks like that green dagger has more weapon damage than the legendary, on live servers (1043.7 on the green, 786.3 on the legendary daggers), it's not actually better than the legendary dagger, because the legendary daggers will have 1572.6 weapon dps in MoP (http://mop.wowhead.com/item=77949)</div></div><hr />

There is nothing innovative about this. You can implement questing and be innovative (TOR, for example.) But to change your own quest rewards after years and years to follow a model that others have been doing for a few years now is a blatant rip off. It's like the first couple &quot;goth&quot; kids had an innovative style. Everyone who came afterward were following the trend....i.e. ripping them off.<br />
<br />
And I'd be more willing to accept the idea that they are flattering their competitors by stealing their ideas if it wasn't for the continued assault by higher ups in ActiBlizz ripping these other games. Or the continued assault from WoW fanboys about how these other games are &quot;WoW clones&quot; or &quot;WoW ripoffs&quot;.<br />
<br />
But you make it sound like &quot;ripping off&quot; isn't done by every single thing ever made, and that its a bad thing, when neither is true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess same goes for the production of cars. Every car that ain't Ford is a ripoff? I mean, they were first with car on 4 wheels, probably first with spotlights aswell and some other shit.<br />
<br />
If you don't like WoW getting ideas from other games, then don't play it. But I'm pretty sure that 98% of you will do anyhow. And to be honest, this shit about dynamic questrewards have probably been on their board for ages, but with low priority.<br />
It's easier to make things right from start (like &quot;TOR&quot;), than making changes later on. And I know I've seen suggestions about dynamic questrewards even before anyone of you even tried the TOR-alpha.</div></div><hr />

Typical retarded response you'd expect from a Blizzard apologist. The reason you don't read comments is that you'd feel the need to post something and remove any doubt that you're a retard. Other games need LFR? Another community destroying device that ActiBlizz has invented to mask the fact that they have many, many dead servers. Great. I certainly hope that all of my MMOs incorporate that ridiculous nonsense from now on. Blizzard invented raiding in its current form? Killing large monsters with a group of several people? Or are you talking about LFR? Which has been lambasted by the many as a pile of shit. Either way, I'm willing to bet that you believe WoW is the first MMO ever made.<br />
<br />
To be honest, most of us are glad that you're not playing TOR. You can stay at WoW with that trolltastic community of assholes. That game is a pile of shit that I will never tough again. I hope that you enjoy the new expansion of Evercraft. PokeRifts of Starwarsia : LoTRO Edition.<br />

Read my other posts. I never said that MMOs don't rip off other MMOs. It's merely a backhanded slap to 1) those who call all these other MMOs out there &quot;WoW clones&quot; and 2) to ActiBlizz (mainly Kotick) for dismissing these competitors while ripping off their innovations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your missing the issue entirely. The spell effect is tied to the spell, its not they cant change the color, its that they cant do so with a glyph easily or in a way that does'nt involve a bunch superfulus code, which is inefiecient from a programming stand point, something they have to be cautious of. It may also require changes across classes and possibly mobs as well. When you see the green fire from say a mob, its not casting the same spell in the database as your warlock is casting, it just may have the same name in the dispaly field, but the spell it self is a different entry.<br />
<br />
They could make the glyph remove the current spell from your spell book, and then give you a new idetical spell with the exception of the color, but then that can lead to having to make changes across the class for all sorts of other effects like procs and such that need to referance this new spell as well, not to mention twice the work when changes are made to it.<br />
<br />
they dont want to just give all warlocks green fire period because some warlocks might still want red fire. <br />
<br />
if you understand how programing and tables work, its easier to understand how it could be an issue for them if it wasn't something that was considered when the spell system was created in the first place. They can of course write new code, but as they say, its alot of time as it affects more than just warlocks, and that means man power and money. Yes they have alot of that, but its something they have to take away from work on something else they may consider more important at thist time. Its not like they have programmers just sitting around on the bench, they are working on things. And simply hireing more only to lay them off later when the work ammount goes down isnt a great plan either, and can lead to quality issues. Not to mention, even when you hire an experienced programmer, they have to learn the ins and outs of the engine before they can work on an overhall to a core system like this. <br />
<br />
So its not that its impossible, they dont say that, only that under the current system used, theres not a good or in thier view acceptable way to do it.<br />
<br />
As a fellow coder, I'd say they were 90% of the way there already.<br />
<br />
Consider Druid forms changing based on hair color. That's already a dynamic spell effect which changes for both the player and all observers. Granted it's tied to a variable which the game already checks when loading models (hair color), and isn't quite the same as spell effects. But considering that MoP will allow a random form color/model on shift via glyph, and that the game has already had *some* customization of spell effects (polymorph, etc.), we're not talking about all that much code left to write.<br />
<br />
I think it's pretty clearly a matter of there being far too few devs assigned to MoP (they've clearly been working on it for 7 or 8 months already, and that's the reason why DS bosses = fighting old, enlarged mob models in Dragonblight), and they are on too brutal a dev schedule to have someone use up a day or two for a feature tagged as low priority compared to Farmville and Pokemon.</div></div><hr />
