Trial of the Crusader - Updated Test Schedule<br />
Here's the current schedule for Trial of the Crusader PTR testing:<br />
<br />
On the European test realms:<br />
<br />
Faction Champions - Saturday Night, July 11, starting at 19:00 CEST.<br />
<br />
The issues that were preventing raid testing on the North American PTRs are still not fully resolved. We're looking into alternative means of enabling testing on these realms. I'll update this thread when I have more information.<br />
<br />
Note that only the 10 Player and 25 Player difficulties will be available on PTR. The Heroic versions will not be available. If you are usually part of raids that easily crushes Ulduar Hard Modes, you should find the non-Heroic difficulties to be not difficult.<br />
<br />
Koralon the Flame Watcher is also available to be tested in the Vault of Archavon depending on PTR Wintergrasp status.<br />
<br />
Test Patchwerks (Tank and DPS versions) will also be available in the Argent Coliseum during similar times to other bosses. Instead of the previous tank test patchwerk that increased melee damage over time, the 3.2 tank test patchwerk will just hit VERY hard (as hard as Algalon) all the time to allow for more lengthy sustained tank parses. We're always interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR, but especially test patchwerk logs. These are extremely helpful to our class team.<br />
<br />
This schedule could change at a moment's notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I'll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. The Trial of the Crusader and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. These bosses are very much a work in progress, and this is a test server.<br />
<br />
Quick Trial of the Crusader FAQ:<br />
<br />
Q) Where's all the trash?<br />
A) There isn't any in this raid zone. Really.<br />
<br />
Q) Where's the loot?<br />
A) Loot is present on the bosses, but note that many of the items do not have final art.<br />
<br />
Q) What about achievements?<br />
A) Most of them are implemented, but there are a few still remaining.<br />
<br />
Q) What about the Trial of the Champion (ie the 5 player dungeon)?<br />
A) This will be available for testing quite soon.</div></div><hr />

they just realized that they fucked up in making the proc the only thing distinguishing it from a hard mode ulduar weapon, and that the proc probably wasnt going to be enough to justify losing 120+ spell power and more regen from ICC weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They went to a hell of a lot of trouble to make sure they explained it was NOT just a pallie weapon. Looks like their mouths don't know what their programmers are doing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markcrux</div><div class="date">2009-07-10, 11:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's well deserved buff: The reason being is that..this is a legendary wep and it is = to http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45612 in stats. The only thing making Val'anyr worth it is it's special ability. I mean Legendary weps are normally signifcantly better than other epics (even if they are hardmode epics), thus the buff is welcome...<br />
<br />
Btw im a warrior, so eitherway idc if this doesn't get buffed, I just think ledgendary weps should stand out from epics.</div></div><hr />

The special ability is freaking awesome, but the stats were kind of meh for being a legendary. Still, I feel level 245 is still not enough for it. I won't be surprised if the mace will be replaced by a new epic healing mace in patch 3.3 as best in slot.</div></div><hr />

No, no, is clearly an Hunter weapon! :P<br />

<br />
<br />
that's bullocks imo, The warglaives were perfectly placed in BT and well tuned for SWP. Thori'dal wasnt usefull in sunwell nor in Wotlk, It was misplaced imo (even though some people consider it a reward for hard work) <br />
<br />
I personally enjoy seeing legendaries being put to use, rather than being placed at the last boss of the last instance in the expansion where it has no use but e-peen.</div></div><hr />

This. It's extremely disappointing wielding this as a Druid knowing the programmers made up blatant fabrications. It's disappointing in general because it pretty much reflects Blizzard's unprofessional programmers and spits on the faces of a good majority of players that just want to play a game that is 'tested' and clear of bugs before things go live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Even though the legendaries considered the worst were the ones that dropped in the end tier instance, and therefore saw little to no use? ( thori'dal and atiesh ) and the ones that were the best were the ones that dropped early enough to actually be used? ( thunderfury and warglaives... and heck, thunderfury had terrible stats, but was still the premiere tanking weapon through naxx )</div></div><hr />

Then SWP opened, and allowed access to better weapons that everyone had within a couple weeks, followed shortly by WoTLK.<br />
<br />
So even though I'd been playing for 5 years, including 11 months in the original alpha / closed beta, that was the last straw. Felt like a big slap across the face.<br />
<br />
Haven't played in over 8 months. So that's nearly $200 lost from just my account alone, because of a crap random loot system, and the lack of will to keep legendary items legendary. Seems they've learned their lesson, but don't feel like making it a retro-active change.<br />
<br />
Didn't even get a Feat of Strength for my accomplishment! (You need BOTH warglaives for that)<br />

Its the nature of a HoT that does not allow it to proc. If your a druid then you should no that HoT's don't overheal, therefor they is nothing for the hammer to work with.<br />
<br />
For it to work, they need to change the way HoT's work, which might mean shit loads more overheal for druids, but is that really a bad thing?</div></div><hr />

I mean it should be STUPIDLY powerful. Like you should look at it and say &quot;Damn, that's just f'ed up powerful.&quot; I don't know A LOT about the proc but other than that it didn't really look all THAT impressive. In a word it should be LEGENDARY. I still don't really think it's all that big a deal for the effort that is put forth to get it. But hey, if you're a healer, what the hell right?</div></div><hr />
