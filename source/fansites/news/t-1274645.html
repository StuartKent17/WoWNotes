Following up on the developer interviews conducted just prior to patch 5.2's release, Greg will be talking a little about his initial impressions of the patch after its first week on live realms, in addition to fielding questions submitted to the TwizzCast team by players.<br />
<br />

Class Hotfixes – 3/12<br />
Any word on when Chi Wave is going to be fixed? As it stands we are lucky to get full duration in a raid setting. <br />
Our developers are aware of an issue with Chi Wave’s heals not bouncing correctly and are working on a hotfix to correct this.<br />
<br />
PVE-wise it's understandable, but when frost bomb had to be nerfed to do 20% less dmg in pvp environment, and now you are buffing it by 40%? Is there really no other way to balance out pve damage, because it really is not fun having something over powered as frost bomb for pvp... <br />
Providing a clarification over PvP damage concerns.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost Bomb now deals 60% of its damage when used against other players, down from 80%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Effectively a 4% buff in PvP then? <br />
That would be correct. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/256667-class-hotfixes-3-12/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8197590653?page=33#648))<br />
<br />
Throne of Thunder Hotfix Reasoning<br />
Hey all,<br />
<br />
Lead encounter designer Ion Hazzikostas (Watcher) has been reading through a lot of your feedback regarding the raid boss hotfixes, and he passed along the following response to this thread:<br />
<br />
I just wanted to offer some context for the recent tuning hotfixes to the Horridon and Council of Elders encounters in the Throne of Thunder raid.<br />
<br />
First off, the Council change, reducing their health in 10-player modes, was honestly just a bug fix. Yes, it made the encounter easier, which also makes it a nerf, but we simply goofed on the numbers. We generally aim for a 3:1 ratio of health for enemies in 25-player raids as compared to 10-player mode, since 25-player raids typically have ~17 DPS and 10-player raids have 5 or 6. Instead, the ratio on the bosses themselves (but not the Loa spirits or Sand Elementals) was mistakenly 2.5:1, and we didn’t notice until we started taking a closer look at why 10-player groups seemed to be having a harder time with the encounter. I apologize for the error on our part.<br />
<br />
Second, regarding Horridon, that change was an intentional difficulty adjustment, with the aim of smoothing out the difficulty curve of the first section of the raid. By reducing the health of the trolls pouring out of each gate, we reduced the DPS requirement (and thus the gear requirement) of the encounter, but generally kept the mechanics checks intact. The trolls having 10-15% less health doesn’t mean that raids can suddenly fail to interrupt Venom Priests, ignore Effusions, stand in Sand Traps, or cuddle up with Frozen Orbs. It just means that there’s a lower DPS requirement to keep up with the waves while doing so.

i clicked the link &quot;last update he gave us on Titan here&quot; above Rob Pardo's twit,<br />
then i checked the video where he actualy said that &quot;we wanted to add panderans to the game pretty much before wow lunched&quot;<br />
<br />
really?<br />
is there no limit to the &quot;panderans have allways been one inch away from being added to the game&quot; propaganda?<br />
<br />

That would be a sequel .... which they excluded (although I would love to see that - taking place inbetween WoW expansions and then the effects of it being felt in a new xpansion! - Perhaps the next fight against the Burning Legion or something!)</div></div><hr />

when the main driving force of a company is shifting from being true to their fans and origin that brought them fame and fortune above and beyond anything they ever dream off in the first place back at early 90s by a handfull of people dedicated to an idea of making games according to their own image to just keep looking for more ways of making more money out of their fans by twisting their own origin vision of game designing backed up by lies like &quot;we were allways THAT close! to putting the panderans in the game&quot; when the truth is that they used that theme only to ride the popularity wave of the kong fu panda and other animated similar theme movies to try and draw new gen of subs after the 12M sub descend and putting a cinematic that basically say Hey! come play the new god mode class, a panda monk, look how it can kick ass even against the horde and the ali combined, a cinematic disgrace that blizz never dared to show even when the first DK hero class was introduced .<br />

Furthermore I would like to thank you for making buffs that you afterwards take away and nerf said ability even a great deal further than what it was previous to making said buff. This goes for pretty much all classes by the way - sit down and think deeply about this. It is a very wise buisness strategy and it clearly show how well you have a grasp on human psychology and how you use said knowledge to create a great experience for your gaming customers. On behalf of the PvP affliction lock community that have stayed with the class long enuff to know and appreciate it in depth, I would like to ask you if you could possibly stop fucking up this spec?

Lock the almost dead realms so no new character can be created, give everyone on the realm a free transfer for all of his character to any realm he desires (including free guild transfers) sans the locked ones. You fixed your major problem in one week. The AFK/frozen accounts can stay on the dead realms forever if they want to, or you can put out a notice to everyones email that you will be shutting the dead realms in one year or so, and they have enough time to move (it's free remember) - or you know store their characters in a database and when they return they get redirected to their account management to move from there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently you and many others can't read that line in the press teaser that said it isn't a sequel or an expansion.<br />
<br />

At PAX East they will.<br />
<br />
Every time something like this happens, and there's all this speculation, like there is now, there are always dudes like you who aren't like, &quot;I think this is what they'll do&quot;, but have to act like you know something when in fact it's just your own speculation, like, &quot;This is what they are doing. You'll see...&quot; or some crap. There's a fair amount of it peppered throughout this thread.<br />
<br />
I'm genuinely curious why? Why the &quot;insider info&quot; act? Why not just state your opinion as such? Especially in a thread full of so many people already doing the same thing?<br />
<br />
(Believe it or not, I'm trying to be way less of a jerk than I'm being right now, sorry about that.)</div></div><hr />

That's technically already been announced. I suppose the wording makes it seem like it could be a playable version of it, but I don't know. I have doubts.<br />
<br />
Because it is no longer a mod for SC2... its going to be a stand alone game.<br />
<br />
If you think for a minute that they've kept anything that we had seen from the SC2 mod at the last blizzcon and transferred it into a full fledged moba game... well then I don't know what to tell you.<br />
<br />
Have we seen &quot;All-Stars&quot; yes (back when it was still just a mod) have we seen ANYTHING from it since they announced they were going to make a Moba game out of it? No.</div></div><hr />
