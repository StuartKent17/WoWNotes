That's fine. You don't have to. You can choose between queues or moving, so do what you want.</div></div><hr />

You can check before you move. 'All' sounds unlikely though.<br />

What happens when major communities switches and just causes queues on the lower populated server? And what about those who have survived the queues to ensure that they play on a healthy server? This is still way too early to open for free character transfers. The drop-off won't be for another 1-2 weeks, so having people start moving anywhere before this happens is just silly.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. <br />
<br />
Blizzard should have listened to the community when it raved about the limited quantity of servers provided during name reservations. <br />
Blizzard dropped the ball on the number of servers, it should have been double what was available during name reservations. <br />
<br />
After classic was released, blizzard opened up new servers the following day.</div></div><hr />

the problem is if half of that servers end up being empty, they might as well be dead. Opening a bunch of servers won't be a good option unless they KNOW they will have a healthy playerbase on them.</div></div><hr />

The warnings were useless given that people reserved names on day 1. Nobody was willing to give up their reserved name to get a slightly shorter queue.<br />

Exactly. This is the flaw in their thinking. That would be the biggest reason not to play on a server, if I don't have my name.</div></div><hr />

We moved our community to the newest PvP realm that was released before EU release and it became on of the most populated ones.. We would be just as good if we didn't move..<br />

Queues still 4 hours+ on Shazzrah from about 3pm on Weekdays, much needed these transfers. Hope this isn't just a US thing<br />
<br />
It used to be 28k queue.. It has gone down to being only 8k tops after 8 days. Wait another week and it will most likely be next to no queue...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't say that's true in Shazzrah's case anyway, it was 9.5k when I logged in at 3:45 GMT, and in those 8 days Blizzard have increased the server size drastically to deal with the strain, so you can't just blanketly compare the 2 like that.<br />
<br />
I do hope some quit/transfer though as it's growing frustrating</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been using it since day 1 to prevent logout and enter queue ahead of time. But it's not really any different than a Remote connection to your desktop, so maybe blizz has said something on that. I figured since I'm not actually having third party software control the WoW client directly it's fine.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
<br />

Blizzard is damned if they do and damned if they don't. They didn't want to release a ton of servers at once because while Classic has a lot of interest, its going to wane just like everything else does in the coming months so they wanted to avoid having too many servers that have low pops aka dead servers. This is a good start and gives people the opportunity to move to another server to avoid queues. If u don't becaues of silly things like a name then you lose the right to complain about login times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Slightly shorter&quot; lol.<br />
<br />
Makes sense, reserve a name on a newly opened server or never get to log in to &quot;claim&quot; your reserved name on the full server(s). Hard choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a lot of us that simply isnt the case, Followed the advice and moved servers lucky enough to get<br />
my chosen names still, When they saw the servers reaching max level maybe locking them was in order.<br />
Raceway has settled down now so about 1,300 waiting in the evening isnt that bad.<br />
<br />
but so many of the EU pvp servers have 14k+ waiting still, When you move servers 3 times and each one<br />
fills to crazy levels something really went wrong on the planning side of this.</div></div><hr />

That's not how realm merges work. No one is forced to change their name, they just append the realm name on to it. They've done it on retail already.</div></div><hr />
