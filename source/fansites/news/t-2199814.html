Is the Riddler's Mind-Worm in game? Spending quite some time looking for it. Just prefer clarification if it were in game <br />
Yep! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/847898186907656192))<br />
Can you say for sure that the Mind-Worm isn't in any difficulty of Tomb of Sargeras? Or is it in the open world?<br />
It's available right now (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/849128713606148098))<br />

Hey Dave, how old can a Half-Elf get in Warcraft's universe?<br />
Half-races are so rare in Warcraft that we don't really have any established lore. (That I'm aware of). (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/847671283407966208))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
In the games you’ve worked on, how did you handle writing ability tooltips? Was it something gameplay designers did, or was it something you had writers handle? And on the subject of tooltips… how do you balance being descriptive without being too pedantic?<br />
I have written shit tons of tooltips. I haven’t done many for League, but I did a ton for WoW and it’s possible I did all of them on some of the Age of Empires games. I also made an editing pass on almost all of the WoW class ability and talent tooltips, and truth be told, I should probably be doing more of that for League, since our tooltips are getting out of control.<br />
<br />
Overall, I find that designers and writers make a few common mistakes with tooltips. Again, I don’t pretend to be the galaxy’s best tooltip writer. I’m just sharing what I’ve noticed.<br />
<br />
First, you can’t teach everything in a tooltip and that’s really not their point. A new player (or even someone new to a particular tooltip) doesn’t need tons of detail. It will just be overwhelming. And an experienced player already knows all of the text anyway. So I often try to think of tooltips as just a reminder about what something is. Imagine that a player frequently confuses two spells with similar thematics, or there is an icon for some kind of menu feature that isn’t super self-explanatory. <br />
<br />
Shorter is almost always better. A few times on Blizzard, we found ourselves in a situation where QA would point out that a tooltip was technically incorrect because maybe it implied that it blocked ALL magic. QA was right to point those potential errors out, but they were just that - potential - and it wasn’t necessary that we took that documentation as a mandate for change. Our tooltips over time started to look like legal documents with lists of parentheticals and exceptions. Just cover the main use cases. A tooltip doesn’t need to provide binding arbitration. Clarity is king.<br />
<br />
Second, I agree with you that it’s easy to make tooltips too flowery. I don’t think tooltips are the best opportunity to show off beautiful writing for the sake of writing. (Now, I’ll also argue that really well written tooltips ARE beautiful.) Flavor text in a different format is a good option to communicate to players “There is something hopefully cool here, but it’s an aside to the main description.” But not every tooltip has room to support flavor text. It is possible to take this too far. Words are precious and you don’t get too many of them in a game, especially for tooltips, so if you can convey a lot with a little, go for it. I named one of the early Death Knight talents “Veteran of the Third War.” I didn’t explain what that meant in the tooltip itself, and it was probably some lame passive stat boost, but folks who knew WoW lore understood the reference. There is nuance among words like affect, blast, penetrate, strike and so on. What feels the most appropriate for your game? But shorter is still better.<br />
<br />
And speaking of room… if you’re an English-speaking designer or writer, it can be easy to forget that other languages take up different spaces. German and Russian for example are long. It can take 50-100% more space to convey the same message in those languages. German also uses long words that can look bad in a narrow tooltip space if they get hyphenated a a lot. Korean is tall. If you devote tooltip space that is horizontally long but vertically short, then Korean characters might get clipped off.<br />
<br />
I’m a fan of style guides. They can be a pain to compose (mostly because you have to get everyone to agree and then enforce them), but the consistency will help provide clarity later on. For example, what kinds of words do you capitalize? I started capitalizing class names in WoW at some point and can never break the habit. Do you refer to the player as “You” or do you try to avoid mentioning them? Are fragments okay? (Probably.) Do you use periods? Do you say “Creates a bolt of energy that flies at a target causing X damage”? or do you say “A bolt of energy strikes your opponent for X damage”? or “Strike your enemy with a bolt of energy, causing X damage”” or simply “A bolt of energy - X damage”? Players may not notice the differences in style (though I always do), but it does help add polish and clarity when tooltip sentences are structured similarly and you use the same kinds of words.

Con Before the Storm<br />
Podcasters, streamers, pro teams, artists, news sites and fan sites come together for Con Before the Storm, which will be on Thursday Nov. 2nd. <br />

Dark Legacy Comics #579<br />
DLC #579 (http://www.darklegacycomics.com/579) has been released! <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jodmos</div><div class="date">2017-04-09, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">DLC is spot on. Most amusing.<br />
<br />
And boy the command center sucks. Follower mission. Hmm, let's think, will I do the one that takes 12 hours and gives me 2 million AP or the nice new one that takes 2 days and gives me 1 million AP. Hardly comes across as a wonderful bonus.<br />
<br />
That the CoEN quests don't give rep is another case of Blizzard trying to drag out the rep grind for flying. <br />
<br />
Apart from the achievement for helping build it 5 times I think I'll stick to the other two unless I'm capped and it's the only one that is being built. <br />
<br />
Edit - actually, the other buffs may make it worthwhile. Don't think I'd mind a legendary champion item but it'll be random and getting a good one won't be likely. Also, the one to give extra legionfall supplies would have been useful as it would help get rep.</div></div><hr />

Feel better that you have a useful and profitable profession in the first place. The armorcrafting professions are useless time and gold wasters. Fishing has a more fruitful outcome than armorcrafters!! <br />

I beg to differ, my GF has made about a million gold over the last 2 months with crafting professions, the 815s(now 835s) sell for anywhere from 2k-50k (no shit, she's sold something that cost her about 100g to make for 50k, think it was a double haste roll cloth chest)<br />
<br />
armor professions are far from unprofitable, you just gotta put a little work into it.</div></div><hr />

They hotfixed it, the WQ for Cath now gives like 250 rep and the Mission now takes like 1 day and awards 5.3M at like 26 AK.<br />

Crafted gear upgrades to 875 atm, and gold is plentiful. I splurge on all my alts. Some pieces are worth more than others, of course. Belts and cloaks are easy slots to fill with raid-drop BoEs, but the crafted tanking trinket (DM Immortality) is absolutely useful for 900+ toons even at 875 item level.<br />

But this is so B-O-R-I-N-G. Nothing is worth the time right now - and heck, it is getting nicer outside, I for one would turn hell lose in the office to keep my subscribers and not only focus the &quot;bigger&quot; parts when the other games have their updates later this year.<br />
<br />
I mean, come on - 75 Reputation from 1 quest? So I am to grind my ass for war resources to turn in 100 to actually get a bit forward? What am I, a school kid who has time for that?<br />
No I do not want it gifted, but balancing a &quot;gating&quot; mechanic like this is just not worth the time. <br />
The Broken Shores are so empty anyways on our realm pool, it's a sad fact of how unpopular this all is.<br />
<br />
My suggestion: increase the reputation gain for the flying.<br />
Further improve (and yes, they were fast there - I still wonder why it was missed out in the first place) rewards / worth my time on the island. Perhaps more quests, you know?<br />
World bosses (bosses? I only know 1) on the broken shores - yay.<br />

That being said, I sure hope they'll increase the intensity of the invasions...<br />
<br />
What would have been nice is you get say 100 or 200 rep so per invasion zone completed.. So as to be meaningful and give people more of a reason to do them and that because the invasions are about every 12 hours or so you stretch it out without it being overly annoying..</div></div><hr />

Come on man, Ghostcrawler is awesome, and experienced AF within the industry and his scientific field, too. :)</div></div><hr />

And the only known &quot;Half Elf&quot; in the game, really, is Kalec...and he isn't even really a Half Elf. He's a dragon who chooses to look like one.</div></div><hr />

Make a ticket. They'll send you a token.</div></div><hr />

Arator, son of Turalyon and Alleria is half-elven. Turalyon is human and Alleria is high elf.</div></div><hr />

Thank you, I did make a ticket. Hopefully they will send me a token. How much rep does the world quest award?</div></div><hr />

Never say if they are percentages or percentage points (additive/multiplicative), and if they stack with others or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And boy the command center sucks. Follower mission. Hmm, let's think, will I do the one that takes 12 hours and gives me 2 million AP or the nice new one that takes 2 days and gives me 1 million AP. Hardly comes across as a wonderful bonus.<br />
<br />
That the CoEN quests don't give rep is another case of Blizzard trying to drag out the rep grind for flying. <br />
<br />
Apart from the achievement for helping build it 5 times I think I'll stick to the other two unless I'm capped and it's the only one that is being built. <br />
<br />
Edit - actually, the other buffs may make it worthwhile. Don't think I'd mind a legendary champion item but it'll be random and getting a good one won't be likely. Also, the one to give extra legionfall supplies would have been useful as it would help get rep.<br />
<br />
uh. the new one in the command center today drops over 5 million.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. So much this. Very uninspiring to see the paltry amount of rep these quests/turn-ins give.</div></div><hr />

It's in my face and I have to scroll through it every time on my favorite site for keeping up with RELEVANT WoW and Blizzard stuff. He left years ago, enough with him already.</div></div><hr />

250 rep. The raid ones will reward 500 but of course that's later in the future.</div></div><hr />

I received the buff when the Nether Disrupter went up, and the buff showed on my character until I entered my HC NH raid last night. I zoned in and out a few times and the buff went away each time I zoned into NH. Several ppl in my raid experienced the same thing while several still had the buff active. Needless to say, I didn't get any bonus rolls refunded because of the bug. Fucking priceless, not being able to take advantage of the buff during my HC NH run, I cannot even believe the number of bugs and glitches I've experienced during Patch 7.2.</div></div><hr />
