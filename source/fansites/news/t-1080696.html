Till Death Do You Part - Iron Man WoW Challenge<br />
Players across Azeroth have recently embraced a new, very personal achievement: leveling a character &quot;Iron Man&quot; style. What started out as only a small movement, this bare bones, no-frills style of play has now transformed into a community-wide call-to-arms known as the Iron Man WoW Challenge, inviting World of Warcraft enthusiasts to see how close they can get to level cap with only the barest of necessities.<br />
<br />
The goal of the Iron Man WoW challenge is simple: reach level 85. The catch, however, is that you must accomplish this task without the assistance of talents, class specialization, stat-improved gear, professions, buffs, item enhancements, or other players. And if you die? Well, then it’s back to square one.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the latest rules (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3966606644):<br />
<br />
THE BIG ONE: If you die, EVER, that character is removed from the challenge. [...]<br />
<br />
<br />
The Most Valued Forum Posters<br />
It’s been quite a while since we’ve shared information regarding our forum MVP program. If you frequent Blizzard forums you’ve no doubt seen jade text stamped across threads here and there. Those with the power to wield green words are regular players -- just like you -- who’ve been recognized for their contributions to the forums in one way or another. And since we want to provide these player advocates with the resources they need to continue being awesome posters, MVPs have direct lines of contact with Blizzard community managers.<br />
<br />
Now the time has come to bolster the MVP ranks. Those chosen for the program aren’t official representatives of Blizzard, and they don’t have to agree with every decision we make. They also aren’t expected to give up their posting personas in order to join. Our goal is to find frequent posters who are a positive influence on the gaming community in some form, whether it be through posting strategy guides or tips on various aspects of gameplay, or even just bringing a positive and constructive tone to the forums when socializing with their peers.<br />
<br />
If you or someone you know fits the description of a Most Valuable Poster as laid out in the MVP FAQ (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4038704715?page=1#2), email us at MVPs@Blizzard.com. We select MVPs based on a large set of criteria, so don’t be discouraged from putting your name out there if you only post on, say, the Protoss Discussion or DPS Class Role forums. MVPs are welcome to post wherever they’re comfortable, including across the Diablo III, StarCraft II, and World of Warcraft forums.<br />
<br />
But remember! The key to being a strong candidate is having a solid posting history. We’re always on the lookout for the next shining beacon of good within the community to join the illustrious ranks of our MVPs.<br />
<br />
Want to know more about how a Blizzard MVP operates? World of Warcraft MVP Eldacar recently spoke with WoW Insider in this behind-the-scenes interview (http://wow.joystiq.com/2012/02/09/behind-the-scenes-with-a-blizzard-forums-mvp-green/).<br />
<br />
<br />
New Transmogrified Screenshot Gallery<br />
We’ve selected some of our favorite screenshots featuring your Transmogrified characters and created a new screenshot gallery (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/media/screenshots/transmog#/1). You can view, sort, and comment on these wonderful creations, and discuss the items that were used to create these unique looks. Send in your Transmogrification screenshots (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/community/screenshots/index.html) for a chance to be featured in future updates!<br />

Well, there's one way to check. You look at someone's level and statistics. You look for max level item equipped. Since white gear is always at or lower than your current level, especially in outland/northrend, you should be able to tell by that. If I were to equip a green item at level 61 or so, it would be ilevel 90+. If I equipped only whites, my max ilevel would be roughly 55-60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are some achivs like &quot;rare&quot; and &quot;epic&quot; that can be tracked to an extent. I'm not sure what all different levels of this achiv exist though.</div></div><hr />

Specless mage with frostbolt and nova would likely kite his way up for a long time, but I could imagine them and priests/locks/shamen hitting an oom wall sooner or later. <br />
<br />
A melee class would be exceptionally hard to lvl, I cannot any non-rogue melee class surviving past the scaling cliff that is 81-85 mobs, they will have nearly twice your hp and likely dps too.. I believe the only way to realistically lvl to 85 as melee is to postpone travel to WotLK areas as long as possible, reach about 72-73 in TBC content, then farm green lvl Icecrown mobs/dailies ad infinitum.. at least that is the only realistic way a warrior would survive the lvl challenge from 80-85, at 82-83 the beefed up hp might allow tackling vash/hyjal quests. <br />

I’m sorry, but absolutely nothing on his comment leads in any way to an add-on being the cause of the problem. Why you say &quot;Sounds like a browser add-on that's causing the problem. &quot; is... well... i better not say.<br />

It made sense and was actually quite challenging (actually attempted it - but got bored) and I could understand those few that took on the challenge. But seriously, all those additional requirements of &quot;The Iron Man Challenge&quot; (like no assistance, talent, prof.,etc) Makes the challenge sounds more boring than watching paint dry. They might as well added in an additional rule of: &quot;You MUST ONLY USE AUTO-ATTACKS&quot;.</div></div><hr />

For what you are describing it looks like flash player is asking your broser to store some data, coockie or whatever in your PC while you have it blocked somewhere in your options.<br />

Noone is forcing you to participate and noone is going to judge you if you don't. I for one took up the challenge just to see how far I could get in pure white/grey items because I like a challenge. So far its proving to be more difficult than I first anticipated.</div></div><hr />

I don't know but I hope someone does, and I hope they do it right this time. I Love, L O V E, love Warhammer's art design. I love big ugly Orks and little evil looking goblins, and big brutish space marines..... NEED WARHAMMER 40k SO BAD. Warhammer was broken as hell and I still played the hell out of it just because I loved the art design so much.</div></div><hr />

I have leveled lots of alts and it is almost impossible to not die till 85 a single time. My comp and internet is not the slowest and I still died due to lag and random DCs literally hundreds of times. That point is just retarded.</div></div><hr />

All thanks to dismiss pet whilst in combat, returning it with full health, and then Blizzard goes and removes mass resurrection from Spirit of Redemption because it was to powerful... fucking apes at Blizzard HQ.</div></div><hr />

You neglected to mention that you also may not use any talent points. I would also like to see you breeze through this non-challenge, since it's not really that challenging. I think you'll be surprised how much of a difference having no stats or talents makes.</div></div><hr />

Its not that its boring, it is just too contrived. The restrictions placed on item use give pet classes an absurd advantage, let alone casters overall.<br />
<br />
I would be all for it relying strictly on quest rewards, no professions, without grouping.</div></div><hr />

Iron Man Challenge (aka Rogue Coddle). No professions, except First Aid (because it's always cool to have someone whipped, so they can Vanish and heal to full...). Does not benefit any other class, except possibly Feral. Why the exception?</div></div><hr />
