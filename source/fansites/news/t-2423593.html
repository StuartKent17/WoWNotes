Horde and Alliance heroes around the world answer their faction’s call to arms in force as Blizzard Entertainment’s latest release surpasses 3.4 million in day-one sales globally<br />
<br />
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 23, 2018-- When the Battle for Azeroth™erupted worldwide last week, champions of the Alliance and the Horde around the globe were called upon to fight for their faction. Heroes everywhere turned out in force, and Blizzard Entertainment today announced that as of Battle for Azeroth’s first full day of launch on August 14, more than 3.4 million units of the latest World of Warcraft® expansion had sold through worldwide—setting a new day-one sales record for the franchise and making it one of the fastest-selling PC games of all-time.*<br />
<br />
“Battle for Azeroth is a definitive chapter in the Horde and Alliance conflict at the heart of Warcraft, and it’s been thrilling to see players representing their factions in record numbers and embarking on their war campaigns—not to mention joining in ourselves,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “But the launch is just the beginning of this conflict. More epic content is coming to World of Warcraft in the weeks ahead, and we can’t wait for players to experience the full story as it unfolds over the course of the expansion.”<br />
<br />
As Azeroth’s defenders continue to explore new regions in search of allies and resources, preparations are being made for the next great confrontation in the ongoing war:<br />
<br />
<br />
In the coming weeks, players will be able to charge into Battle for Azeroth’s first Warfront, Stromgarde—a 20-player co-op battle for control of a key strategic stronghold in the Arathi Highlands.<br />
On September 4, the gates will open to Battle for Azeroth’s first raid—Uldir, an ancient titan facility housing horrific Old God experiments gone awry.<br />
Also on September 4, the expansion’s first PvP season and first Mythic Keystone dungeon season will commence. The Mythic Keystone dungeon will feature a unique “seasonal affix”—Infested—that introduces new challenges based on the corrupted denizens dwelling in the Uldir raid.<br />
Beyond that, additional updates are in the works that will provide even more content for players on an ongoing basis, including the ability to recruit the Kul Tiran humans and Zandalari trolls as playable Allied Races. More information on future updates will be shared at a later date.</div></div><hr />

If the doomsayers can find a way to turn an expansion that's sold better than any other into a negative thing then they have issues.<br />

Well it's not.<br />
<br />
It sold 3.4 million in it's first day. How can it be more clear than that? <br />
<br />
Are you going to say anything post Wrath is misleading just to spin the argument to suit your point?<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if the day 1 sales are digital or physical. It's still money in their pocket.<br />
<br />
And maybe it would have been more if they were around before Cata. However we will never know.</div></div><hr />

So yeah, it's sales since the beginning of presale. IT IS misleading - proof: You misunderstood it.<br />

Still really good numbers, no doubt.</div></div><hr />

Look, I'm not saying 3.4m sold in the first day isn't great. It is, and it bodes well for the future given where things were headed at the end of WoD. But they pass it off like it means WoW is as popular as ever, and that's clearly not the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't seem to care enough to brag about slowing players down during leveling, or the bad scaling that makes max lvls have more problems in killing the exact same stuff, etc.<br />
<br />
It's really sad how people on the outside have no idea of the mess these guys are pulling here because of the lack of information and being showered with bragging junk like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And your source that it's not as popular as ever? I mean you are entitled to your opinion but unless you have a viable source on that one all you have is wild speculation I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
It clearly is if it can hold stronger sales than previous expansions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Either way, they've had presales for at least the last 4 expansions (MoP has pre-sale to get into beta... I don't think Cata did but I forget). So it's POSSIBLE it didn't outsell Wrath in 1 day sales or something but it's still very impressive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's generally accepted that pre-release sales figures are counted as &quot;Day 1&quot;, so yes, that 3.4m includes all of the sales they made over the past several months to people wanting to play their allied races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You people are really easy to fool, aren't you? You do realize that selling even one more copy than previous becomes a new record?<br />
<br />
Number of copies of sold on day 1 for each expansion:<br />
<br />
BC - 2.4 million<br />
Wrath - 2.8 million<br />
Cata - 3.3 million<br />
MoP - 2.7 million<br />
WoD - 3.3 million<br />
Legion - 3.3 million<br />
BfA - 3.4 million<br />
<br />
OMG! It's a record!!!!<br />
<br />
The expansion sales are statistically flat for a very, very long time now. BfA barely outsold Cata for day 1 sales.<br />
<br />

Not saying it's not a small increase. But it's still continuing a trend that has been a longtime thing for them in sales.<br />
<br />
Which is a successful trend. I mean MoP deviated a bit but not by much either.</div></div><hr />

But the game very clearly isn't dead if it's an increase is it? Even if a minor one. That's what doomsayers will tell you, people trying to say that the game has less than 3 mil subs are clearly wrong.</div></div><hr />

It's not possible to give definitive proof now, as Blizzard stopped giving out subscription numbers. But if anyone believes they still have anywhere close to 12m active subscriptions (which they did at the end of Wrath), they are woefully misinformed.</div></div><hr />

Nobody claimed that it has close to 12 mill. Even I doubt that personally.<br />

You people are really easy to fool, aren't you? You do realize that selling even one more copy than previous becomes a new record?<br />
<br />
Number of copies of sold on day 1 for each expansion:<br />
<br />
BC - 2.4 million<br />
Wrath - 2.8 million<br />
Cata - 3.3 million<br />
MoP - 2.7 million<br />
WoD - 3.3 million<br />
Legion - 3.3 million<br />
BfA - 3.4 million<br />
<br />
OMG! It's a record!!!!<br />
<br />
The expansion sales are statistically flat for a very, very long time now. BfA barely outsold Cata for day 1 sales.<br />
<br />
/facepalm<br />

<br />
Should have been in the 5 mil range.<br />
<br />
So when it's not as popular as it's subscriber peak it should have sold more than it did at it's subscriber peak? How many expansions, or even games, sell three million copies? This is far from weak sales by any metric.</div></div><hr />

Very weak sales as they tied it in with allied races. People said the same thing with MoP having weak sales as that too had a tie in as well.</div></div><hr />

Quite possible but Ion said a long, long time ago, that Blizzard is aware of and okay with the &quot;cyclical&quot; approach to playing the game.<br />
I find it quite enjoyable too. Sub for a month or two when there is interesting new content, leave the hamster wheel of AP/Gear grinds to the diehards while playing more interesting stuff. :D</div></div><hr />

I'm actually surprised that they haven't sold more. Still pretty good results for an old game.<br />
<br />
But being the most selling expansion doesn't actually show any of the games quality. WoD did really well and they lost half their playerbase within the first quarter, I wouldn't be surprised if that was also the case with Legion. Its seems more natural that most people only play a new WoW expansion for a month or two and then unsub until the next expansion arrives, so its easy to manipulate numbers without showing the actual subs trough the games lifespan.</div></div><hr />

I think time zones and release dates are always taken into account.

<br />
And I'm going to tell you that I wasn't referring to the game in general when it came to sales.<br />
<br />
Every company counts presales these days because gaming is slowly moving towards a digital thing. Physical media in the very distant future will either be sparse or not a thing for games. Hell there are companies who don't even include discs anymore. Just a code in the box.<br />
<br />
What benefit would they gain by being deceitful? Not to mention this is information they will more than likely use for investors so I doubt they would want to get themselves in trouble by lying to them to gain an advantage. It's close if not tantamount to securities fraud. Key word being close.<br />
<br />
I mean you could have at least tried having a discussion rather than resorting to petty insults. If anything you are the one making it difficult to have any form of discussion when you lash out because someone dares to debate your discussion point.</div></div><hr />

Aye I'm enjoying it so far. Not without it's faults of course. For me it's the Azerite stuff and Islands.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, BfA was the first time (probably last too, though) I pre-ordered from Blizzard since I want to avoid that kind of practise. I just really wanted to be able to play with Nightborne too so I at least have 2 races I can enjoy on the Horde side, rather than just 1!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We didn't have to wait long for doomsayers, don't we? ;D Of course it's same people like rda, Nyel, etc. My favorite &quot;argument&quot; - WoD also sold well, ergo BfA will be shit like WoD ;D&quot;.<br />
<br />
And I don't think they ever feel silly, you have to have minimal self-awareness for that. I mean, you could think that WoW is &quot;dying&quot; when subs started droping in Cata (although it was just illusion, we didn't saw the sub pattern only because stream of new players was massive first few years of WoW), but after 4 IDENTICAL cycles (10 millions on launch, huge drop and low point in the middle, slow growth from last patch to next pre-patch) they still shout &quot;oh WoW is dying for good this time, you'll see&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Waiting for that number of active subscriptions. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
You won't see it. They know huge drop after 8.0 will happen anyway, so they want to avoid creating bad PR. But you can count that some dev will &quot;leak&quot; sub numbers in random interview and Blizz will &quot;deny&quot; that this are official numbers right after that ;P ('member Chilton interview for polish magazine right after Legion launch?).</div></div><hr />

You people are really easy to fool, aren't you? You do realize that selling even one more copy than previous becomes a new record?<br />
<br />
Number of copies of sold on day 1 for each expansion:<br />
<br />
BC - 2.4 million<br />
Wrath - 2.8 million<br />
Cata - 3.3 million<br />
MoP - 2.7 million<br />
WoD - 3.3 million<br />
Legion - 3.3 million<br />
BfA - 3.4 million<br />
<br />
OMG! It's a record!!!!<br />
<br />
The expansion sales are statistically flat for a very, very long time now. BfA barely outsold Cata for day 1 sales.<br />
<br />
/facepalm<br />
<br />
I just wanted to quote this because(according to your own figures) it shows that BFA outsold everything else you linked on day 1, including Legion.</div></div><hr />

It's truly had to believe that in that single day 3.4 million copies sold, but I can believe that 3.4 million copies sold from the time pre-orders started until the day of launch.<br />

Phrasing it that way is just as skewing as other games saying they have 13 million players simply because there have been 13 million subs activated at some point between release and today.</div></div><hr />

They mean number of copies sold by launch day. If they meant anything else then they would be touting all those copies that sold so people could access allied races early in some grand total.</div></div><hr />

I don't think this number should surprise anyone - Cata had 3.3M, MoP 2.7M (it clearly show that people really disliked Panda theme - of course it doesn't have anything with quality of expac), WoD 3.3M, Legion 3.3M. If anything it shows Blizz doesn't have to make &quot;world ending&quot; threats to hype people for expansion.<br />
<br />
Although if 9.0 will be what I think it will (Scourge 2.0 with Bolvar, Sylvanas, Necromancers, maybe Bwomsandi and Kelthuzad) and they will use all WotLK nostalgia (in that situation I bet they will), we may break another record in 2 years.<br />
<br />
<br />
10 mln ppl will buy classic day 1<br />

No, it will be 20 mln. Currently 40 mln people play on super secret private servers, so I estimate that half of them will buy classic.</div></div><hr />

Nah they'd never do that.<br />
<br />
Sales mean they're doing good and could never be used to imply anything else! /sarcasm They'll put in fixes later, but first they need to show how successful they are.<br />
<br />
Honestly, people who feel game sales mean a game is good or doing well are the people they are targeting.<br />
<br />
It's just like movies, ones that are generally accepted as being pretty awful but are say DC movies or Cult classic reboots, they may make an incredible number at the box office because people dedicated to the fandom go to see it anyways, but at the end of the day the over all consensus is that it was a bad movie that made an incredible amount of money.<br />
<br />
I am someone who bought BFA because.. well WoW has taken up a large part of my life and even though I quit playing legion a month after legion dropped, I still wanted to try the new expac. <br />
<br />
I probably won't last a month with BFA, but I'm still counted in those numbers of purchases. I won't be counted in the retained customer numbers that they'll pull in 5 months (and then won't tell anyone about the numbers they pulled). I find the later number more important., I don't really forsee a WoW expac having a massive decline for years.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
These numbers are interesting. If you take the expansion sales as a representation of the momentum/popularity of the game based on the performance of the previous expansion, MoP and Wrath were the most successful. Both resulted in a 500K gain in purchases for the next expansion. Cata would be the worst, causing 600k people to decline to buy the next expansion.<br />
<br />
It also seems that 3.3-3.4 million is the number of people who form the baseline of the game. We know subs were much higher in TBC, Wrath, Cata (at least at the beginning) so people continued to buy the game after release day or stay subed from the previous expansion. We no longer know the sub numbers and can't tell if more than 3.4 million, or how many, buy the game after release unless Blizzard releases sale numbers. In this case, first day sale numbers do not really give a lot of information on the health of the game, or the impression that it is where it was in Wrath.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think this number should surprise anyone - Cata had 3.3M, MoP 2.7M (it clearly show that people really disliked Panda theme - of course it doesn't have anything with quality of expac), WoD 3.3M, Legion 3.3M.

<br />
It shows that people distrusted WoW after how bad Cata was. You would think that Legion would have a similar drop in purchases, but it didn't probably for the reasons I stated above. Legion may have also received a bump from the large amount of fan service - TBC Burning Legion theme, Demon Hunters. Either that or digital pre-orders even out the sales as it gives people a long time to buy prior to release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there wasn't a drop after WoD, that tells me it's not about how bad the last expansion was, but more about how interesting the theme of the new expansion is. That definitely explains why MoP was much lower - the panda thing was controversial. Also WoD drew a lot of people in, but was a flop in the end game - but those expansion sales already happened.</div></div><hr />

Considering that there was no digital purchase option before WoD for many countries, those numbers show that its stable, but not that its amazing feat. Old expansions had most purchases after release simply because players couldn't pre-purchase.<br />
<br />
Comparing BfA to Cata is misleading because Cata didn't have digital pre-sales.<br />

<br />
Every company counts presales these days because gaming is slowly moving towards a digital thing. Physical media in the very distant future will either be sparse or not a thing for games. Hell there are companies who don't even include discs anymore. Just a code in the box.<br />
<br />
What benefit would they gain by being deceitful? Not to mention this is information they will more than likely use for investors so I doubt they would want to get themselves in trouble by lying to them to gain an advantage. It's close if not tantamount to securities fraud. Key word being close.<br />
<br />
I mean you could have at least tried having a discussion rather than resorting to petty insults. If anything you are the one making it difficult to have any form of discussion when you lash out because someone dares to debate your discussion point.<br />
<br />
All I said was that it was deceiving that they said its the fastest selling expansion when they had 8 months of presales. They're comparing to games that didn't have digital or incentives baked into current content. I'm unsure why you brought up other games using presales in their metrics. The statement from blizzard has nothing to do with other games nor did my response. You were so concerned with policing this thread for people that don't agree with you and worship blizzard that you failed to have any reading comprehension. You didn't try to have a discussion so I didn't attempt it either. <br />
<br />
I play just like you and just like the majority of people in this thread. I do enjoy BfA. That doesn't mean I can't speak ill of Blizzard or their actions. It does not mean I'm a doomsayer. It does not mean I don't still enjoy the game. I wish more people would understand that.<br />

Also I never said they lied. Being deceiving and lying aren't always the same thing. Saying something is the fastest selling over the course of 8 months when compared to expansions that didn't have the same presale circumstances is deceiving no matter how you slice it.</div></div><hr />

You would think that Legion would have a similar drop in purchases, but it didn't probably for the reasons I stated above. Legion may have also received a bump from the large amount of fan service - TBC Burning Legion theme, Demon Hunters. Either that or digital pre-orders even out the sales as it gives people a long time to buy prior to release.<br />
<br />
Oh, I disagree 100%. People just buy expansion if it grabs their attention, they don't analize pros and cons of previous expacs. Also large chunk of them buy expansion, level to max, explore a bit and leave until late last patch, when hype is growing again - for them lack of endgame in Cata or WoD is non-existent problem.<br />
<br />
MoP just looked too silly on first look. And people didn't like it. For example check MoP reveal trailer on youtube (and compare to any other WoW video).. yeah, you'll understand what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />

Not surprised at all ... I've personally been having the most fun in this expansion since Wrath. <br />
Feels like they have a home run to me across the board ( except for the GCD which I still think needs to be loosened up a bit more ).<br />

<br />
You people are really easy to fool, aren't you? You do realize that selling even one more copy than previous becomes a new record?<br />
<br />
Number of copies of sold on day 1 for each expansion:<br />
<br />
BC - 2.4 million<br />
Wrath - 2.8 million<br />
Cata - 3.3 million<br />
MoP - 2.7 million<br />
WoD - 3.3 million<br />
Legion - 3.3 million<br />
BfA - 3.4 million<br />
<br />
OMG! It's a record!!!!<br />
<br />
The expansion sales are statistically flat for a very, very long time now. BfA barely outsold Cata for day 1 sales.<br />
<br />
/facepalm<br />
<br />
<br />
A record for a 14 year old game is a record. It sales info is the most important thing to look at @ for health of the game not subscription. Look at those sales...14 years if i invest $x to create expansion #X i will sale about 3 million copies and get a return of Y. <br />
<br />
That formula has not changed. The day those first day sales drop ....i give 3 expansion of decreases and there will be no more. Or the time in between will get bigger and bigger. <br />
<br />
Those sales will tell you when the game is dying. Right now it is as healthy as it was 14 years ago.</div></div><hr />

And you base your guess on what? For years we had around 3.3M copies sold and around 10M subs on release (on Legion we don't have official numbers, but I believe that number from Chilton interview is valid), nothing indicate it would be any different this time. 5.5M sounds rather that low point midway through expansion.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Warlords of Draenor sold over 3.3 million copies within the first 24 hours, and subscription numbers increased from 7.4 million to over 10.5 million in November 2014.&quot;<br />

<br />
Like every game of this genre then? GW2, FF14, ESO and so on. Games that will always have a good influx of day 1 expansion sales then settle down because their playerbases are limited as well.<br />
<br />
However Blizzard have managed to keep that sales figure stable since TBC times with one drop off throughout it all.<br />
<br />
Nothing new. The fact is it outsold more than the other expansions. Will it be good? No fucking clue. <br />
<br />
I mean if it's bad I'll happily come back and say it is. Right now I'm enjoying it with it's odd issues.<br />
<br />
WoW to me remains one of the few games that's had me hooked on a near consistent basis so it's doing something right for me as a player. The only other MMO close to it is FF14.<br />
<br />
GW2, ESO, Rift, Wildstar, BDO, Runescape, Neverwinter. Just a good chunk that while some I thought were good games never managed to keep me hooked.</div></div><hr />

It outsold them on the first day due to hefty rewards for preorder, it doesn't mean sales will be better overall. I'd actually assume that Q3 2018 will be worse than Q3 2016 since preorders were boosting Q1 and Q2.<br />

And you can assume all you want. Neither you nor I have anyway of knowing other than mentions within investor reports.<br />
<br />
You act like they are the first company to offer a decent preorder incentive?<br />
<br />
FF14 offered small ones, GW2 offered a free 80 boost in one of their expansions and have higher tier editions with better stuff in and usually gems and so on.<br />
<br />
Preorder incentives are nothing new. It's a clever way to boost sales. Simple as that. Blizzard aren't the first ones to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And yet you already missed a nuance. It didn't sell 3.4 million in it's first day, buy by it's first day. By it's first day the expansion was already out for months, with highly pitched exlusive content, the allied races, that you could only play or start to level if you had bough the pre-sale. <br />
I'm not sure why any avid WoW player would not have bought the pre-sale, as this time around even if you wanted the physical box the upgrade to that was available.<br />
Also remember that in terms of easy gold there was nothing like Legion in WoW's history. If you think WoD opened the gold floodgates, Legion did a double whammy. Even relatively casual goblins now play a 'free' token funded second account just for their auction house alt on a second monitor.<br />
<br />
Fwiw, I like the new artwork and zones in BfA. I think they did a realy poor job of overall class design, professions are dealt a bad hand, and I'm extremely skeptic that the xpac's PvP theme will have a long lasting appeal and hope they will not be too bullheaded when the shit hits the fan and create a new WoD situation.</div></div><hr />

Actually I'm disappointed by the figure. Given the number of people that now have more than one account as a result of easy gold, and that there was plenty of resaon to buy the pre-sale and no reason not to, I would think that by 'launch' day nearly 3/4 of Y1 sales would have been accounted for, which would make BfA a poor sales xpac.</div></div><hr />

Didn't realise for PoF since I never bought it. I know HoT did though which is why I said just 1 to be safe.<br />
<br />
Allied Races are a bare minimum incentive at most. None of those races are required as a player. <br />
<br />
I mean it was an incentive. But I doubt it was that much bigger than early access to Demon Hunter.<br />
<br />
Pre order incentives will always be a thing. Be it for an ingame costume, sub races, early access to the game and so on.<br />

It's nothing new and Blizzard were actually quite late to the party in capitalising on it.</div></div><hr />

You're right, no one can because blizzard doesnt release subscription numbers anymore. You can generally tell the quality of an expansion a month or two after the first raid releases. My point is that sales numbers don't dismiss criticisms of the game.</div></div><hr />

No I don't. I'm responding to someone who thinks that how good or bad a product is taints the sales numbers. It makes no difference how much 3.4 million people like something after they've purchased it, when the only statement being made is that 3.4 million people bought it.</div></div><hr />

You people are really easy to fool, aren't you? You do realize that selling even one more copy than previous becomes a new record?<br />
<br />
Number of copies of sold on day 1 for each expansion:<br />
<br />
BC - 2.4 million<br />
Wrath - 2.8 million<br />
Cata - 3.3 million<br />
MoP - 2.7 million<br />
WoD - 3.3 million<br />
Legion - 3.3 million<br />
BfA - 3.4 million<br />
<br />
OMG! It's a record!!!!<br />
<br />
The expansion sales are statistically flat for a very, very long time now. BfA barely outsold Cata for day 1 sales.<br />
<br />
/facepalm<br />
<br />
3.4 is bigger then 3.3<br />

I call BS. I think they are fudging the numbers to make it look good. There’s no way that many people are playing the game right now. Why else are they looking at another round of realm mergers? Hmm? Just sayin... and there is a large amount of negative feedback about the expansion, so I’m guessing they aren’t going to publish the sub numbers anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

Holy fuck the density of some people... no there are not that many players playing it right now. There are actually more. The first day sales are always way less than the people actually playing. It will drop later but right now the numbers are big</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prokne</div><div class="date">2018-08-23, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, I disagree 100%. People just buy expansion if it grabs their attention, they don't analize pros and cons of previous expacs. Also large chunk of them buy expansion, level to max, explore a bit and leave until late last patch, when hype is growing again - for them lack of endgame in Cata or WoD is non-existent problem.<br />
<br />
MoP just looked too silly on first look. And people didn't like it. For example check MoP reveal trailer on youtube (and compare to any other WoW video).. yeah, you'll understand what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
This is true, but I think the people who buy the game before it releases are the kind of people that played through the previous expac - the people who were playing at the time of the pre-release at the end of an expansion. The drop in purchases shows a wait and see approach from people who quit during the previous expac. At least for digital pre-release which I think started in MoP (not sure since I bought CE on release day). For TBC, Wrath and Cata there were no digital pre-releases and buying the game before it came out was not something most people did unless they were diehard fans.<br />
<br />
So what I think these numbers show is that there is a baseline of about 3 million players who buy the game no matter what, at least since MoP when the Wrath popularity of the game had moved into its current player base, which is at much lower levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's possible that fewer people buy the game in the days after release than they used to. With Wrath, you have 2.8 million day one players, but the subs went up to 12 million, so 9 million people bought the game some time in the next 2 years. With everything post Wrath, where we know sub numbers were lower, less people bought the game after release day relative to release day purchases. So, BfA might only sell 2 million more units in the next 2 years (it's unreasonable to say more people won't buy the game later), or it might sell more or less. What really matters is the sub numbers, which we don't see anymore.<br />

I wouldn't say they are fudged, just misleading. It makes it seem like BfA is the most successful game they have released, but doesn't take into account different distribution methods not available in the past. It's also sort of misleading to say that pre-release is day 1 sales. They should break apart those numbers - pre-release sales and day 1. I would be very surprised if BfA sells as many copies as TBC or Wrath, but these numbers make it seem like sales are increasing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abysal</div><div class="date">2018-08-23, 08:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are a lot of factors here.<br />
<br />
1. I believe that the ability to convert gold to battle.net balance will naturally boost pre-orders. It is easier to justify pre-ordering a game instead of waiting for reviews when you're not spending money from your own bank account.<br />
<br />
2. The state of the global economy is better. WoW has always been a big money sink. In 2012 when unemployment was high in most of the countries that play WoW, it makes sense that there'd be a lot of people who couldn't justify spending their money on a subscription based game. In 2018 with most of those same countries in significantly better economic shape, it makes sense that some people would be more willing to spend the money.<br />
<br />
3. If you didn't quit after Cata, didn't quit after MoP, didn't quit after WoD, why quit after Legion? I think there's a pretty stable baseline of players who are basically never going to quit WoW if possible. The fact that WoD, Legion and BFA all had basically identical day 1 sale numbers seems to support this theory. I would guess that most of the people pre-ordering BFA were also the people pre-ordering Legion and WoD.</div></div><hr />

Is the sharding. They are using it a lot. When i do a group the players appear and they stay in the shard and i can see them playing even after leaving the group.

<br />
Yeah, the ability for many players to purchase the expansion with BNet balance not usable for anything other than digital content gave BFA a huge advantage over the other expansions, particularly considering the day one, preorders included aspect of this record. It's not like that $60 in BNet balance was going to get you through to your next paycheck, potentially delaying your purchase of the game, most people who had the BNet balance pulled the trigger early because what else are you going to spend it on?<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, 3.4 million is still 3.4 million. It really goes to show how smart a move the wow token was for Blizzard. It helps them retain players that might not stay subbed and current in the game if they actually had to pay for it.<br />
<br />
No knocks on the expansion or the game, but as far as this record goes? It needs a big fat * next to it.</div></div><hr />

You've never ordered video games for a retail store, have you? It's not &quot;it retails for $50 so the retailer gets half&quot;. The RETAILER is lucky to get $10. Video game retail has a VERY slim margin of profit.</div></div><hr />

Well, the numbers mean at least 3.4 million people are playing BfA. That's not very much when compared to past expansions where we knew the sub numbers. It really just means that Blizzard considers it a success since they have shifted to focusing on sales instead of subs as their marker of success. This makes sense since the sales are fairly even (gaining slightly at release) while subs are a roller coaster.<br />

<br />
<br />
The 3.4 includes pre-orders, which is why it can't be compared to the most successful expansions because they didn't have digital pre-orders. It would also be interesting to see how many units of the previous expansions were bought so that the number can be put in more perspective. I'm also thinking the length of pre-sales before the exp comes out plays a factor - longer time to buy, more sales. But, I don't know the numbers for these things.</div></div><hr />

Classic wow purists will be furious with these numbers. Some of them claim that retail now has 100k-200k subs tops xDDD<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
That's so misleading. If they'd have had digital presales pre-Cataclysm, 3.4m wouldn't come close to setting the record. Wrath almost certainly would have been somewhere north of double that, maybe even more than 10m.<br />
<br />
I doubt that. wrath had 2.8m day 1 sales. even if they added digital. maybe a couple of 100k more.<br />
<br />
People who wanted to play will buy the game even if it's in another city.<br />

<br />
It's interesting how they try so hard to portray this junk as some sort of pinnacle of development. Guess it's only money that counts, huh?<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW IS the pinnacle of development whether you like it or not. you get all kinds of complicated systems that no other MMO managed to even maintain or bothered to create.<br />

<br />
Not surprised by this. Huge hype behind this expansion, so many people returning or new ones wanting to try it out. Helps that so many big streamers played it.<br />
<br />
The question is how much is retained in 3 months, 6 months. WoD was a massive success as well.<br />
<br />
Every expansion is a huge hype when you think about it. But this number is certainly due to the success of Legion and the spot on marketing for BFA.</div></div><hr />

If I had to guess, WoW generates about 1.4-1.8b revenue every expansion cycle. So 700m-900m a year. <br />

Horde and Alliance heroes around the world answer their faction’s call to arms in force as Blizzard Entertainment’s latest release surpasses 3.4 million in day-one sales globally<br />
<br />
IRVINE, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Aug. 23, 2018-- When the Battle for Azeroth™erupted worldwide last week, champions of the Alliance and the Horde around the globe were called upon to fight for their faction. Heroes everywhere turned out in force, and Blizzard Entertainment today announced that as of Battle for Azeroth’s first full day of launch on August 14, more than 3.4 million units of the latest World of Warcraft® expansion had sold through worldwide—setting a new day-one sales record for the franchise and making it one of the fastest-selling PC games of all-time.*<br />
<br />
“Battle for Azeroth is a definitive chapter in the Horde and Alliance conflict at the heart of Warcraft, and it’s been thrilling to see players representing their factions in record numbers and embarking on their war campaigns—not to mention joining in ourselves,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “But the launch is just the beginning of this conflict. More epic content is coming to World of Warcraft in the weeks ahead, and we can’t wait for players to experience the full story as it unfolds over the course of the expansion.”<br />
<br />
As Azeroth’s defenders continue to explore new regions in search of allies and resources, preparations are being made for the next great confrontation in the ongoing war:<br />
<br />
<br />
In the coming weeks, players will be able to charge into Battle for Azeroth’s first Warfront, Stromgarde—a 20-player co-op battle for control of a key strategic stronghold in the Arathi Highlands.<br />
On September 4, the gates will open to Battle for Azeroth’s first raid—Uldir, an ancient titan facility housing horrific Old God experiments gone awry.<br />
Also on September 4, the expansion’s first PvP season and first Mythic Keystone dungeon season will commence. The Mythic Keystone dungeon will feature a unique “seasonal affix”—Infested—that introduces new challenges based on the corrupted denizens dwelling in the Uldir raid.<br />
Beyond that, additional updates are in the works that will provide even more content for players on an ongoing basis, including the ability to recruit the Kul Tiran humans and Zandalari trolls as playable Allied Races. More information on future updates will be shared at a later date.<br />
<br />

&quot;Tell them,that the Lich King is dead. And that WoW died with it&quot; - one of the biggest bs i've ever read. Long live WoW!</div></div><hr />

<br />
enjoy the game, I have no problem with that, I enjoy it as well for what it is... i'm just pointing out how hilarious it is that you think presale statistics mean anything<br />
<br />
You realise anything from 1 million is thriving yes?<br />
<br />
There are games with way less players than WoW that are thriving. FF14, GW2, ESO and others to name a few. A game doesn't have to have 10 million subs/players to be thriving. Not a single one has P2W either. Not that WoW does either just making the point.<br />
<br />
If games can survive just fine on 500k or less players what makes you think this wouldn't?<br />

BfA had by far the most enticing preorder incentive of any expansion, and it became available months ago. I'd expect to see this trend continue in future expansions as a result. Another unfortunate push toward Blizzard embracing preorder culture more aggressively.<br />
<br />
<br />
well usualy I am against pre orders,but in the case of well established mmo's it is a very different situation,with wow you know what you will get,you will never get some bad surprise like with new IP's or singleplayer games or bless's 5th atempt at tricking a market</div></div><hr />

Yeah... no you didn't understand that in your first post. Please note also I am not a wow is dead chump, but you clearly misunderstood when you claimed they &quot;It sold 3.4 million in it's first day. How can it be more clear than that? &quot;. They didn't even claim it like you did. That is why its misleading, you were (easily) mislead by it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are 3 types of physical.<br />
<br />
Pre order box with a code so you can get the boost right away, DVD box and CE.<br />

I like collecting physical so yeah I went with the CE this time. Got it sat nicely next to my Borderlands 2 ultimate loot chest edition. :)</div></div><hr />

HOWEVER, I would argue that the record sales numbers speak very little of BfA's success but more so of Legion's as people want more of that. Same goes with the WotLK, Cata, MoP sales. WotLK was wildly popular so Cata had high sales and actually the peak of subscribers. Cata was less popular and MoP sold poorly (also due to &quot;Omg Kung-Fu panda&quot; prejudice). BfA sales numbers is likely due to a hype campaign and following the most well-received expansion since WotLK. Hopefully BfA will keep living up to the expectations as it, to me, has done so far.</div></div><hr />

Because players don't comment if they like something, heck, my whole friendlist and irl friends who I know are not active on forums at all and they are heavy gamers. Maybe it has something to do with age, people who work and have family don't like to spend their time off on a whining website and play a game instead. :)</div></div><hr />

Legion didn't have any grind required, I'm yet to see if BfA will have any.<br />
<br />
yes i realiZe that and BFA has both grind (Rep, AP) and gate (Zandalari allied race, M+, Warfronts, Raids) separately.<br />
<br />
So you're saing farmin rep in BFA with 75rep per WQ needing exalted to unlock a single allied race is not a grind???</div></div><hr />

<br />
75 per wq, as well as missions, rep tokens from wqs for an extra 100 and so on. <br />
<br />
It's a grind but it's not that bad.<br />
<br />
Right now today there is about 1300 or so rep up for Honorbound for me. And only 200 of it is tokens from WQs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You act like that's still not profitable for them though. <br />
<br />
The game could survive no issues on 500k subs. I'll never understand this obsession with sub numbers. I mean yeah more is better but at the end of the day the game is still profitable and has a huge amount of players.<br />
<br />
I mean feel free to predict. People said TBC would kill the game because it was an expansion. 12 years later and here we are.<br />
<br />
People who claim all the time WoW is dead/dying don't know what an actual dead/dying game is. Here is just a list of a few.<br />
<br />
Mortal Online.<br />
Rift.<br />
Wildstar.<br />
Age of Conan.<br />
Dungeons and Dragons Online.<br />
Everquest 2.<br />
Darkfall.<br />
<br />
List goes on. Those are actual dead/dying games.<br />
<br />
And yet again you are free to find it underwhelming. Just don't act like your word is law. There are people enjoying it and there are people who dislike it. Like every expansion.</div></div><hr />

I see even more sales in the coming weeks, as people hear the massive positive comments about it.<br />
And I also see many Classic players giving it a try, because why not, nostalgia will lead many to Classic, but curiosity is still a thing.<br />
<br />
Then there is the challenge of maintaining these numbers with good endgame content, and if anything, Legion has proven that Blizzard finally had the good recipe for that.</div></div><hr />

The 'players' posting whine comments are actually the people who don't wanna miss out on ingame content because they are addicted to the game because the play it for either so long and/or they spend a lot of time in his / her characters. They whine about this game for years and they still have an active sub. Hmm rofl.</div></div><hr />
