Along with killing rare spawns, looting chests, or doing a quest, you can now purchase them for 50,000 x Timeless Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin) from Mistweaver Ai (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/73305-mistweaver-ai).<br />

PvE<br />
Shado-Pan Onslaught raid debuff in the ptr. I thought valor upgrades were supposed to be the 'make bosses easier' buff/debuff?<br />
That's the design for current tier. If anyone is still struggling in ToT, it feels like 5.4 is the time to let them finish it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363733933780770816))<br />
<br />
WoW is all about personal exp. Class satisfaction and smooth gameplay is the recipe, and not the content.<br />
Yet that is clearly not what a lot of players want. They want their spec to be desirable for a viable comp. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360768324356931584))<br />
Well the game is NOTHING in comparison to vanilla and TBC. PvP is unbalanced and &quot;heroic&quot; raids are too easy.<br />
Um I think the heroic raiders would tell you these fights are the hardest they've ever done. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360767976875622401))<br />
Some say that people just got better. Back then there were only few good players. Could be.<br />
No doubt in my mind that players got much better. Just consider the tools we have now: e.g. Icy Veins, Ask Mr. Robot, even DBM. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361067227224612864))<br />
<br />
As far as PvP goes that's a bigger topic but we've been most successful in seasons with a few, balanced comps. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360768167452217348))<br />
I'm sorry, how long has ToT heroic taken to clear? A few weeks? So compare that to the Sunwell and BT? Which took MONTHS...<br />
I'm pretty sure the number of attempts (the relevant metric) per heroic boss has never been higher. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361066629519511553))<br />
<br />
How was the feedback on 10vs25man droprate of TF? Personally I'd prefer 15% 10man 25%25man or so. We didn't see too many in 10<br />
10s want more of course, but we're fine with it being a small 25 perk. (This was not the overall reason for TF though.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361065373870731264))<br />
its a HUGE perk in 25s when in 10s u get a tf drop finally and its a tank shield but ur tanks are druid and monk -.-<br />
We kind of think 25s need more perks though to overcome the inherent logistical benefits of 10s and effects of entropy. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362001361396695040))<br />
I'm in a Taiwan server, an RL of 10s, still stuck at Leishen because 25s is too easy and ppl just dont want to run 10s.<br />
We heard a lot from players in Asia that 25 was too hard compared to 10s. Why do you think your experience is different? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362456298073231361))<br />
(Note for non-Asians that Asian 25s have buffed bosses, drop better gear and are on a different lockout than 10s.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362456536108367872))<br />
<br />
TF items suck, I've yet to speak to anyone within my community ( top 20 US 25 man raiders ) that likes it.<br />
Very high end raiders often don't want any randomness to loot because that infringes on skill being the deciding factor in a race. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362308824947892224))<br />
<br />
no one wants to spend weeks and weeks and weeks trying to get a single piece of loot. Wrath/cata model, GO BACK TO IT!<br />
The opposite potentially worse problem is that you're sitting on 11 characters with full loot wondering what to do next. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/360771514691366914))<br />
<br />
trying to understand ur design philosophy with instances. Which do you design to be harder? Challenge modes or heroic raids.<br />
They're just different. Not sure which is harder. Heroic raids you can outgear to some extent. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363742349026795520))<br />
<br />
What were your impressions of MoP's appeal/success in Taiwan when you visited? Any big differences from US/EU?<br />
No huge diffs. They're very into the story. Lots of Qs about Klaxxi in SoO. Probably more raid-focused players there than here. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363741245413138432))<br />
<br />
As convenient as LFR is s, I worry that seeing content robs people of motivation to raid Normal-modes. Is that a concern?<br />
Not sure how many players run normal just to see the content. Normal has always been fairly hard. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363399227289763841))<br />
A bigger concern is that LFR robs people of the motivation to have friends, and we think friends are really important. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363399349398548480))<br />

The Burdens of Shaohao<br />
If you can't get enough of Lorewalker Cho's storytelling, this should be a fun week for you. Blizzard is releasing (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/265688-the-burdens-of-shaohaopart-3-fear/) a six part series that looks at Emperor Shaohao as he progresses toward discovering the truth about his future. <br />

Yeah right, &quot;heroic&quot; raids are too easy. Hilarious, especially considering this tier has two of the hardest encounters to date. Saying that, especially in this tier, just shows what a troll you are. Nobody who has 13/13 HC in ToT will say it was &quot;too easy&quot;, only the kiddies not able to join a raid other then LFR.<br />
<br />
Seriously, Bosses in Vanilla and BC were hard because we didn't have all the addons and gear played a way bigger role(not saying it was worse or better). Today the mechanics IMO are way more complicated and there are tons and not only 2 or 3 per encounter. Thinking about Dark Animus and LeiShen HC alone those fights are awesome and hard as hell, so much stuff to watch out for, so much responsibility for each raider and not only a hand full.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come on, you don't need 13/13HC to know HC are too easy, if a noob can kill the first boss on HC then he (rightfully so) thinks that every encounter is easy but all his raiding mates suck thats why he's not 13/13 HC yet.<br />
<br />
But hey let them noobs all talk, reading comments from Method etc. (optinions which actually means something, because they been there) shows that they all thought especially LeiShen is one of the hardest encounter in the game and not like in TBC for the wrong reason (overtuned), because there are tons of mechanics you need to watch out for, an individual error causes often a wipe and each player needs to be on their toes. <br />
<br />
But let them talk, that are those players you see in LFR doing 200k dps less then you in the same spec and 20iLvl below you and blame it all on gear.</div></div><hr />

What purpose do these vendor items serve?<br />
<br />
Because per Blizzard, like it has been since WoW came out, weapons should be the hardest things to get, seeing as they also give the most player power increase, usually.<br />
These weapons SHOULD have been item level 502, like ToT LFR, imo.<br />
The Blacksmith crafted Reborn weapons were just stupid (imo) because they took way too much crap to craft, and also taking a month to craft one single weapon because of daily cooldowns.<br />
Because of that, I don't do the daily cooldown on my Blacksmith, those bars are rather pointless.<br />
<br />
Same with killing those summoned mobs on the Isle of Thunder, I don't think many people touch it anymore.<br />
The chance for a drop was so low, and at the same time the item level was only 476, so it seems they kind of stick with that.<br />
<br />
You want higher item level weapons without being in a guild?<br />
Run LFR SoO and expect it to take some time because of shitty drop rates and working as intended tuning / RNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny that nobody just stop and think that not only the drop chance is probably low (and you will roll against other 9+ players), but it will also made to last more than a few levels and one xpac.<br />
<br />
Just like other BoAs go from 1 to 80, 1 to 85, etc.<br />
<br />
It would make the raid worth farming for longer, since a new xpac you would just throw away your gear really fast (would it still be worth farming something just for 90-95 when you get weapons from questing/dungeons at each level?).</div></div><hr />

It's all about options, i remember a thread from GC about this same thing for crafted items in Dragon Soul. How they were kinda useless to make for guildy's. He said something like &quot;They want to give multiple options to get loot, not everyone plays the same way.&quot;<br />

Anyone know how long on average it could take to farm 100,000 coins? xD<br />
<br />
month with casual farming<br />
week with medium farming<br />
1-couple of days with hardcore farming<br />
<br />
the farming itself isnt hard it just depend on what event you lucky to have when you farm<br />
the elite boss pirate ship with 130m hp give around 2k coins<br />
other events give around 500-1500<br />
while normal elite mobs give around 50</div></div><hr />

SOMETIMES available(not &quot;readily&quot;, I only see them listed at all on a sporadic basis) for 15-20k gold.

Oh well at least i can get the coins for the serpent i guess thats a positive since i don't want that trinket.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And some raid encounters in Vanilla and TBC were unforgivingly overtuned a for considerable amount of time to begin with, C'thun and Mu'ru being the most prominent examples. There's &quot;challenging&quot; and then there's &quot;deliberately impossible.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Guessing you do not understand the concept of &quot;keeping them playing&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thing costs 10 coins you earn it in 20 min, then moan about nothing to do.<br />
<br />
Thing costs 10000 coins you continue to grind for it thus keeping you logging in and entertained(in a fashion).<br />
<br />
It also make the item its self more rewarding.</div></div><hr />

See: Skyshards. That's the other end of the spectrum. You either gradually but definitely make progress, or sporadically make progress based on tiny % chances. I know I prefer the 100,000 coins option.</div></div><hr />

Or just make them a little more difficult to obtain, relative to the time it takes to accumulate 10,000.<br />
<br />
Though, in todays world of &quot;i'm entitled to get something out of everything&quot; i guess they have to put coins on every source available to getting them.</div></div><hr />

Idd it is, but seriously, why do you think that encounter was any good? I personally don't think it brought anything new and exciting other than confusing and clumsy mechanic and in my opinion it was the worst encounter in ToT. Especially in 25man where 1 person could screw you over and over again no matter how good others do, I call that a bad design.</div></div><hr />

I like my grinds without RNG, and most of the people that I play with agree. I would rather have to gather 1000 items with a garaunteed drop rate of 1 per mob, than get 100 with a 1 in 10 chance of dropping on a mob kill.<br />

Agreed, they MIGHT make sense if they were BOA so you could send them to an undergeared alt. But BOP?????, on an Isle you have to be geared higher than that to farm on???</div></div><hr />

Seriously, Bosses in Vanilla and BC were hard because we didn't have all the addons and gear played a way bigger role(not saying it was worse or better). Today the mechanics IMO are way more complicated and there are tons and not only 2 or 3 per encounter. Thinking about Dark Animus and LeiShen HC alone those fights are awesome and hard as hell, so much stuff to watch out for, so much responsibility for each raider and not only a hand full.<br />

I raided in BC, and I raid now. Today's bosses do indeed have far more moving parts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the heroic raid we have now really doesn't compare to the raids in TBC at all.<br />
<br />
BT was cleared in 21 days, Lei-Shen heroic was killed in 20. Thats not even counting Ra-den, and not counting the fact that the world first race is FAR more competitive these days and thus those cutting edge guilds raid for far far longer in the same amount of time than they used too. Also not counting the fact that we have so many more tools at our disposal now and players are simply much better at the game. Saying it is nothing compared to TBC raids is just outright ignorant. Sunwell was cleared in a similar time frame.</div></div><hr />

What purpose do these vendor items serve?<br />
<br />
I think your term ´readily available´ is very server dependent. On my server, I almost never see any craftable epic weapons. Right now, on a weekend, there are 0 listed... and counting on an LFR drop isn´t fun if you are trying to gear up a new alt quickly. I think their intention has always been that you can use LFR to increase your ilvl quickly and get you into the current LFR within 2 weeks of dinging 90.. but expecting to get a sha-touched weapon in that time is doubtful. I don´t think it is bad that they have some redundancy for bad rng, or for those on low pop servers or who don´t want to spend 10k gold on a weapon that will last probably a few weeks. The timeless island ones you can probably get in a few hours.<br />

Anyone know how long on average it could take to farm 100,000 coins? xD<br />
<br />
It really depends on your ilevel. Right now, probably a huge amount of time.. at the end of this expansion? much much faster. Middle of next expansion? a few hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I was going to comment on that. My server is mid-population, certainly not low pop. But it is a simple math problem. if you take 0 items on my AH, and multiply it by 5 severs I will be connected to.. you still have 0 items on the AH. I know that isn´t an accurate thing to say, but I do think it will be closer to the reality than saying the BS weapons will suddenly become ´readily available´. Also, even if you do get some, there won´t be much competition and prices will remain above 10k or 20k or whatever they go for.<br />
<br />
The timeless island weapons will be fairly easy for an alt to get, especially with shared tagged mobs. Sure, you won´t be out there soloing elites, but you won´t have to.. and the good thing is as you are getting coins to buy your weapon, you will also be getting the armor upgrades as drops.<br />
<br />
It is one of the pieces of advice I gave my guild. When 5.4 launches, get your alts out there fast, because during prime-time the first week, it will be very easy to become part of a ´pack´ and get to the chests and kill rare spawns. But if you do the typical thing and use your main first, in a few weeks when you get to your alts, there might not be those packs of players helping you kill elites. My two main characters will be able to solo everything there, my alts will need a lot of players around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are for alts? what does not make sense? You now have 3 options<br />
<br />
1. Hope to God for great RNG while doing TOES to get your sha weapon.... run it appx 10-15 weeks (probability)<br />
2. Spend 10-20k for a weapon on the AH... if you happen to be on a server where there actually are any listed ( still none on my server)<br />
<br />
3. Spend an hour or two on timeless island.. tagging along with a group of people who will be killing rare spawns in order to get coins to buy your weapon. At the same time, hopefully getting some of the armor drops as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know this is a difficult concept... but not everything added to the game has to be progression for raiders. I have 0 doubt that within the first two weeks of 5.4, I will have 6 of these weapons on my alts. Do I want to spend 15k for a weapon for each of them? nope Do I want to run each of them through TOES for a 20% chance to get a sha weapon? no Would I enjoy spending a couple hours on my alts roaming around timeless island? Yes<br />

Agreed, they MIGHT make sense if they were BOA so you could send them to an undergeared alt. But BOP?????, on an Isle you have to be geared higher than that to farm on???<br />
<br />
You don´t have to be geared nearly as much as you think. Everything is shared-tagged, and the chests respawn very fast. if you are very undergeared, you probably don´t want to play at 4am in the morning.. but if you play semi-normal times it will be VERY easy to tag along with others. As far as the chests.. yeah, if you are in a group, you might not get the chest first.. but the chest respawn timers are much faster than the guardian mob respawns..<br />
<br />
I am not sure of the longevity of the island for mains, IMHO, it would be best to get your low geared alts in there the first week so you can tag along with other people´s mains.</div></div><hr />

Not crazy at all it's just how i see it now, there was addons in TBC too you know there was bugs but not as many as people say, well in vanilla there was but in TBC it was fairly bug free (not perfect ofcourse).<br />
<br />
heroic dungeons back then took time, investment and really good knowledge of your class, that is only true for heroic raids today and yet i still find heroic raids not too hard anymore, either i got way more skilled somehow or the raids haven't been made harder, again personal opnion here.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw i use a few addons, none of them has to do with combat at all as i don't like addons that help me in a fight, bagnon, bartender is the 2 i use and that's about it, i don't use DBM, Vuhdo or any of those others at all, never have and never will.<br />

Yeah right, &quot;heroic&quot; raids are too easy. Hilarious, especially considering this tier has two of the hardest encounters to date. Saying that, especially in this tier, just shows what a troll you are.

<br />
I never ever ever said &quot;too easy&quot;, i said not as hard.... huge fucking difference but the reading capabilities from some one calling me a &quot;kiddie&quot; and &quot;noob&quot; does not surprise me at all here. Guess having a civil converstion with you is out of the question though.<br />
<br />
The fights today are awesome, but to me they are not as hard as the old ones like C'thun, Four Horsemen, Mu'Ru or even Yogg-Saron (alone in the darkness). <br />
<br />
And again, i don't use combat addons even today as i don't find them necessary, you should try without addons actually, it will improve your level of skill so much and you will learn the tells on the bosses.<br />

<br />
It's not ignorant at all as that's how I feel, man this community REALLY likes to read what they want from a post, this is why i rarely post on MMO anymore.<br />
<br />
And again, i use the same amount of addons i did since i started playing, 0 combat addons and yet i find these raids not &quot;too Easy&quot; but easier than the ones in vanilla/TBC, this is not a fact, it's an opinion.... but i am out of here seems people, like i knew already, like to take things out of context and force their way of thinking onto me instead of actually accepting others opinion. <br />
