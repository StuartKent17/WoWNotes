Patch 6.2.2 Hotfixes - September 10<br />
Creatures and NPCs<br />
Tanaan Jungle<br />

Harbormaster Korak should no longer go into evade mode if more than one player is engaging him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />

<br />
Archimonde<br />
<br />
All of the following Archimonde encounter changes requires a realm restart to take effect.<br />
We have made a number of changes aimed at reducing the difficulty of the Archimonde encounter for smaller raid groups on Normal and Heroic difficulty, with a focus on the final phase of the encounter in particular. These changes are offset by increased scaling with respect to raid size, so that the experience for larger raid groups will be mostly unchanged.<br />
<br />
Infernal Doombringer's health has been reduced by up to 15%.<br />
Shadowed Netherwalker's health has been reduced by up to 15%.<br />
Living Shadow's health has been reduced by up to 15%.<br />
Reduced the damage of Wrought Chaos by up to 20%.<br />
Reduced the damage of Shackled Torment by up to 20%.<br />
Living Shadows now spawn from each Nether Tear at a reduced rate for smaller raid sizes.<br />
<br />
Added a 3-second cooldown to the periodic healing of Eternal Flame, preventing Infernal Doombringers from healing other Infernal Doombringers until 3 seconds after spawning on all difficulties.<br />
Archimonde's health has been reduced by 10% on Raid Finder difficulty.<br />
<br />

Guild Changes - Method<br />
Sco posted (https://www.facebook.com/scostream/posts/629591700513799) an update on what is happening to Method today.<br />
As you are probably aware already there are big changes happening in Method. There are a lot of issues at play that caused this, some more complex than others – a psychologist could probably write a novel on the situation. There has been a pretty bad atmosphere and strained relationships in Method, and while in the past the unified goal of pushing for world first has kept the guild together this is evidently no longer the case. In short a very basic summary of issues that caused separation;<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft, and more specifically hardcore raiding is in decline. There is a lack of competition; 2 Horse race versus Paragon each tier. The effort required to raid at a hardcore level (locked away for 2-3 weeks) is not necessarily enjoyed as much as it previously was.<br />
People are motivated to play by different factors and at various levels, as always external factors like money are involved.<br />
Lack of leadership. To state it plainly; the member’s faith in the officer team’s ability to lead due to motivation and drive wasn’t at its strongest. Over time there has been a ‘transfer of power’ between the officer team and the members. For example raid leading was done by Kuznam and certain other activities was being organised by members.<br />
Different views on the Method expansion inside and outside WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
These issues have split the guild over time and various cliques have sprung up along the way damaging the ‘one team one dream’ nature. Unfortunately key people such as Kuznam (raid leader), Pottm (organised a lot for T18), and a few others have decided they would rather start afresh in a new guild alongside those they closely associate with. The remaining members are left with a choice and to cut straight to the point, many members will obviously follow the raid leader which is understandable.<br />
<br />
In regards to the future for Method; there is 0 intention of letting the Method guild die. We will use the resources at our disposal to rebuild the guild. I have already been speaking to people externally and I have no doubt we will get something good going. The approach to expansion release and next tier will remain hardcore raiding and while world first will obviously be a stretch depending on how many core members we lose, we will still be aiming for the highest rank achievable. With the way the current raiding scene is at the moment, we are also investigating the possibility of streaming the entire progression. Will let you guys know more when I know more. Thanks for your support.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guild Changes - Midwinter<br />
Slootbag and Furty (https://twitter.com/furtyirl) are also moving from Midwinter to Serenity. An excerpt from Slootbag's statement (http://slootbag.com/time-for-a-change/) is below:<br />
These thoughts started to seed themselves very minorly in my head before we killed Blackhand as it was the most/hardest we ever raided, and that is one of the larger times when there started to be a divide in guild hours/capability/desire to raid etc. As that tier ended, and people voiced opinions, and we raided and concluded this tier, it had become clear to me that the large variance in the desire of hours raided was now a large divide between some people, myself being on one extreme of the spectrum.<br />
<br />
I’ve been in Midwinter for 5 years now (I’m the second-most veteran member), since late WotLK, and since my joining in the guild I’ve been one of the (and at times the) largest advocate(s) of pushing harder, increasing hours, realizing a higher potential of the amazing team we have here. With bumps and bruises along the way this guild has grown into one of the biggest powerhouses in top-end PvE raiding and it is amazing. However, we’ve now reached a point where there is unfortunately now a large disconnect in my desire to go HAM af and the guild’s pace at which it will achieve its future rankings. I feel the need at this point in my raiding career to be able to raid with 20+ other individuals who can (or want) to share and dedicate that same amount of time until that final boss dies and push as hard as possible putting aside any obligation.<br />
<br />
So while I wholeheartedly believe whatever the guild chooses to go with for raiding direction, it is not something I can participate in any longer. I love the people here and always will, but the suppressed feeling I have of wanting to push more has eaten away at me just too much, and if I were to go forward with it I would be doing the guild a disservice as likely my attitude and performance would start to show signs of deterioration. As a result my fun has just not been there as much, and has started to completely wane.<br />
<br />
I wanted to wait until Midwinter finished a series of important guild meetings to go ahead with my decision as I wanted to hear every single person’s opinion and desire going forward, as this is what will shape the future of Midwinter. All of this has inevitably (for me) led to my decision that I will be retiring from Midwinter raiding and will be participating my MT duties over at Serenity, the large branch of Method now reformed (was actually Method when I made this post, but PvE IRL Cataclysm happened).<br />
<br />
My options included joining another US guild or starting my own guild in the US. However the first option does not (currently) exist in the form of a hardcore 7-day progression guild currently, and the second option is something that is just too much work in my current time, as I’m still focusing on improving my stream.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Guild - Serenity<br />
Some members of Method are forming a new guild called Serenity (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/twisting-nether/Serenity). They released this statement to Manaflask (http://manaflask.com/articles/method-players-leaving-and-forming-new-guild-slootbag-joins-serenity-kuznam-pottm-and-sco-s-statements-added).<br />
Hello,<br />
at this point it's no secret anymore that we've founded a new guild &lt;Serenity&gt; after leaving Method.<br />
With this statement we'd like to briefly let you guys know about why we left and what our goals are for the future.<br />
<br />
The reasons for leaving Method basically come down to 2 points:<br />
1) Lack of leadership within the Method guild<br />
2) Different opinions on the direction of the WoW PvE guild Method and the organisation Method<br />
<br />
After a lot of talking on both matters, we weren't able to to get to common ground and couldn't find solutions that worked for both sides. This is why a majority of the PvE guild decided to start something fresh, completely cut off from the Method network and management.<br />
<br />
With &lt;Serenity&gt; our goal is crystal clear. We will have our full focus on the World of Warcraft PvE race and are going to compete for #1 while still having a nice guild and raid atmosphere as it used to be in Method.<br />

Flippable Table Easter Egg<br />
Solsacra (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/847284-Solsacra) discovered (https://twitter.com/Solsacra/status/641833426627244032) a fun easter egg with the Flippable Table (http://www.wowdb.com/items/88801-flippable-table). A little ghostly crab appears on the table occasionally when used by a Ret Paladin!<br />

Weird. After kicking Treckie guild said that there are no relationships between guild members at all. They are playing with each other only to finish their goal - rank 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
With our goal is crystal clear. We will have our full focus on the World of Warcraft PvE race and are going to compete for #1 while still having a nice guild and raid atmosphere as it used to be in Method.<br />
Well i do not believe to this 'nice guild and raid atmosphere' when you have to be fresh and sharp thinking for +10h every day for 2-3 weeks progressing things. Sco statement has only proven it.<br />
<br />
The fun thing is Method was a few days ahead Paragon in several last WF races (except Imperator). Now some ppl want to push it even more. That's strange.<br />
Well atleast it is going to be slighty more interesting race than just Method vs Paragon.</div></div><hr />

yea because all hardcores gone to Wildstar (/sarcasm). Hardcore raiders was always very few, but the game shined because of the awesome classes, world and leveling replayability. Most people done all that though and left nothing to do...</div></div><hr />

No, just that it getting old. How many people still play some awesome old game, like Super Mario 3. No game can really hold the top for more then a couple of year without getting replace. 10 years is already an awesome feat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The offspring guild that's going to form from Method will de relatively well, probably a top20 spot. But that's not going to cut it for them as they aren't used to not being at least top 3. That guild will die after 2 tiers due to too much bickering about failing. Method itself will struggle but depending on Sco's choices and motivation to continue they will last and get back to top 10 or better relatively fast. I've seen guilds come and go over the past decade but without a good leader they will crumble really fast. Being a good raid leader isn't the same as being a good guild leader.<br />
<br />
In a nutshell: Kuznam, Pottm and the others think they're making a choice for the better but it will only get worse. Where can you go from #1 spot? If Sco stays motivated, Method will continue to compete for first place.<br />
<br />
Have a good day.</div></div><hr />

Amazing how you can assume the guild's performance without them even having A SINGLE RAID YET.For all you know they can go to the bottom or the top.You cant make any assumptions till first legion race.You sound more like a method fanboy that wants to condem them just for leaving.</div></div><hr />

If you would be around for a while you'd know that I'm anything but a Method &quot;fanboy&quot;. The plain truth is that I have been playing under several guild leaders in the past both hardcore and casual and I indeed base my assumptions on those experiences. I don't condem anyone for making a different path of choice, I'm just guessing it won't work out as well as they think. And for the record, I have played with Sco in the past, I didn't leave on good terms but I know for a fact that he's the reason Method is still standing unlike the other great guilds in the past, Death &amp; Taxes, Nihilum, Ensidia, Forte, Last Resort, Midwinter, Curse Gaming, Inner Sanctum, Conquest, Afterlife, Sk Gaming, Ascent, Fury, you name it. They're all dead and gone. And Method is still around, the reason is the guild leader because it has cycled through hundreds of players over the past 10 years. Unless the offspring is going to magically pull a great guild leader out of their hat, it ain't gonna work. Main reason being, these players will not have the patience to build something up over the course of 2 years if they're used to competing for world firsts. It needs to work well, right from the start.</div></div><hr />

I think they are wanting to save alot of information for Blizz Con. I am quite curious as to what feature of the game they can't talk about that is their favorite over artifact weapons, demon hunters, or orderhalls. Only feature they really did not talk about was the transmog unless there is a feature they are keeping under wraps until Blizz Con that has never seen the light of day yet.

If you can't regularly communicate in a consistent channel -- then it's better to STFU.<br />
My boss never learned this and always got burned.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're getting new X.&quot;<br />
<br />
Few months later funding was pulled for X specifically. This was 100% out of our control -- even out of our agencies control. He never told anyone.<br />
<br />
Fast forward a year later when people are asking when we're getting them and he tells them we aren't. No context, no more information, nothing. Word of mouth spreads.<br />
<br />
His lesson learned: People can't handle the truth and keep your mouth shut.<br />
<br />
The real lesson learned: If you can't regularly be honest with your people then keep your food hole shut until you are ready to commit to it.<br />
<br />
Why is this a lesson? Because talking about ideas is fun -- and people will think your ideas are what you're doing. They lack the concept of &quot;entertaining an idea without committing to it&quot;. In fact, as a developer, I've learned very few people can handle this -- and you can usually spot the ones that can.<br />
<br />
SMBC had a comic about this once that dealt with research.. it's *sort of* the same thing.<br />
<br />

<br />
Love how the Raid leader is talking about lack of leadership xD<br />
<br />
Depends on how you run your raids.<br />
I've been in a guild where you had a main tank, main healer, main rdps, main mdps.<br />
Their job was to manage the people under them.<br />
<br />
The advantage to this method, if you have that many capable people, is you have more eyes paying attention to mistakes to call out CD's when needed.<br />
This is VERY advantageous.</div></div><hr />

5,600,000 x $14-ish (aassume 50/50 3 months subs against 1 month subs) = $78.4 million.... per month. That's just under a billion dollars per year. Yep. Cow has milk :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are assuming that all of the subs are playing in the west were there is a monthly sub. The east works on a different model. If you want the real figures you can just look at the Blizzard financials. They give the sub revenue there.</div></div><hr />

I can smash my head against a badly tuned boss, mistakes done by a different player each time and organize multiple persons with different playing hours it's just a nightmare. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, older players that raided 10-15 years ago won't put effort in this activity anymore and newer generations are more interested in other genre of games, like Dota-like and FPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It reminds me a little of Ensidia forming, although there was more cooperation there and less breaking apart to rebuild. To me, this seems like an attempt to recreate what Ensidia did (at least until ICC). They took a lot of Method's great players and also acquired one of the best tanks in the game. Although strange thing to note, WoWProgress placed Serenity ahead of Method for T18 progression. I think that might be because they each have enough players from those raids right now to qualify for guild runs and the tie-breaker is avg ilvl (which Serenity wins now)...seems a little strange though to have the progression tables able to actually change when the progression is over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a mistake for him no matter what happens. He wants to compete at that highest level and he's going to find a group that shares that mentality. For all we know Midwinter could have been on the verge of calling it quits like practically every other high performing guild seemingly is with them finishing 25th being the nail in the coffin. <br />
<br />
This kind of thing was bound to happen. The churn eventually was going to cripple guilds left and right to the point where I wouldn't be surprised if none of the top guilds are still intact even halfway through Legion at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was obviously something up internally at Midwinter during HFC progression. They went from being a potential contender to falling to 25th (actually pushed back to 26th on WoWprogress because Serenity exists now) in the later stages of the tier. Something happened there that diminished what they were capable and I imagine the talks Sloot referenced have to do with them taking a step back from that level of raiding. Sloot wants to stay at the high level they were at in BRF and the only place to really do that now is Serenity or Paragon, not surprisingly he chose the one with the guys who have been dedicated to (and successful at) getting world firsts for years. Sloot is one of the most skilled tanks playing the game and he is joining up with some of the most skilled dps and healers. Not to mention that the players in Serenity match Sloot's own dedication for getting world firsts. Sco and Justmonk appear to be staying in Method so Sloot looks to be the clear choice for MT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a guy who runs a guild which isn't even near the level of Method (thus requiring even more work to maintain if it were) I can assure you that raiding long hours during progression (which is usually about 2 weeks) is NOTHING like the commitment it takes to run a guild year round. You spend many more hours OUTSIDE of raid keeping things together and running smoothly than you do inside raid. There's nothing ironic about what he's saying. Making his own guild, specifically from scratch, is WAAAAAAAAY more work than the amount of time he wants to raid during progression.</div></div><hr />

I think the easy lie we tell ourselves is that nothing matters/we won't care. But now, looking fifteen years back, I wish I had spent every single minute I've spent gaming practicing my music and art, creating things,honing skills. I have fond memories of video games but they're mostly superficial.</div></div><hr />

The east works on a different model. If you want the real figures you can just look at the Blizzard financials. They give the sub revenue there.<br />

i love me some re re.<br />
<br />
does this get you wet? bickering like a preteen over semantics? Lets assume that a whopping HALF of those are of the &quot;different model you propose&quot;<br />
<br />
okay, you got him. you win. Blizzard is only making a HALF a BILLION dollars a year then. This is of course not counting the services they sell in abundance and the RMT over the blizzstore etc. <br />
<br />
Use your brain, its there for a reason and it isnt to be a troll on the internet.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a regret but I would have had more balance in life. Priorities change when you get older.</div></div><hr />
