Warcry posted their preview (http://wow.warcry.com/news/view/75268) of Zul'aman. Nothing really new but there are still some informations (I may have missed them in previous interviews)<br />
The 4 Animal Gods will be : Nalorakk (Bear), Lynx (Halazzi), Dragonhawk (Jan'Alai) and Eagle (Akil'Zon).<br />
The 2 other bosses will be Jin'zakk (http://www.wowwiki.com/Hexxlord_Jin%27Zakk) and Zul'jin (http://www.wowwiki.com/Zul'jin) (Final Boss)<br />
The dungeon is splitted in 4 wings. You should be able to complete each wing within an hour with a decent group. <br />
Blizzard is working on something called &quot;Logical loot&quot;. Previously, the loot tables were somewhat random. They're not going back and fixing years of content, but now, players can expect creatures to drop things that one would expect. If that bad guy is holding a big, shiny axe, then odds are his loot is a big shiny axe.<br />

Epic mounts<br />
This information won't have any impact on the game before 6 months, but maybe it will make some poor people happy. Epic mounts price might drop, later, maybe. <br />
Depending on how mount riding skills are going to progress, the most likely point for a price drop would be with the release of the next expansion, just as the ground mount prices dropped when Burning Crusade was released. Again it would likely depend on a few factors, and may actually not change. But that's a question for a later time.<br />

<br />
Also, &quot;They hope the quality will be as good as Ventrillo and rave about its quality during internal testing, but it remains to be seen how it will hold up when exposed to their millions of subscribers. They also mentioned that they hope to look at things like voice fonts (distortion that makes the user's voice sound a bit like the creature they're playing)&quot; ... Not sure about the voice fonts thing, but uh, vent-quality voice-chat sounds good to me. If they do it right of course.</div></div><hr />

Oh here we go again..<br />
<br />
Personally I farmed the 1000g for the original Epic mount.. and I laughed when people demanded a refund.<br />
<br />
This won't be till next expansion, and its unlikely flying mounts will be used in Northrend (too cold for wyverns imo) so all thats happened is you've paid (probably 2000g) more to get your epic mount now, then wait a year to get it in the next expansion when they will be worthless.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-26, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed on the 3000g to begin with, I still don't have it on my mage, but I'm dedicated to getting it on my hunter (get Depositbox, nice UI mod for saving, put it to 90% to deposit automatically and you'll only &quot;recieve&quot; 10% of your gold you pick up or get to your bag, the other 90 goes to a hidden depositbox that can be accessed or you can choose to completely remove all access to hte box until you reach a goal, thats how I got my epic.)<br />
<br />
but I have to say, no flying mounts in Northrend, maybe some zones but not all, Northrend is notorious for wind that cuts to the bones and ice storms that decimate armies, not to mention if you flew above a mountain a scourge archer somewhere would probably pick you off =/<br />
<br />
Maybe give us new epic mounts 120% ground speed? that requires 375? I personally would like to see weather effects that bestow buffs or debuffs, chilling cold? -## health per second, character movement -10%, sandstorm? -5% chance to hit, raining? +10 frost damage -5% character movement, etc.</div></div><hr />

5k gold isnt that hard to get. <br />
1) stop standing around in your major citys for 2 hours of your play time.<br />

Why is a Level 63 Hunter talking?? Its the easiest class in the game to level and you havent even taken the time to get to 70. The game doesnt even start til you hit 70. So stop reading forums and go level. Until then the rest of us will simply ignore anything you say. <br />

when the mount riding skill is only at 300, so there's room for one more training.<br />
<br />
god only knows what it'll be but im already saving up for my next mount.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malineros</div><div class="date">2007-07-27, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I the only one that thinks there is not necessarily going to be another riding skill increase?<br />
<br />
Just because the other skills (FA, LW, Eng., BS, etc.) go up to 375, this doesn't mean Riding has to top out with the same number. After all, combat skills stop at 350 (5 per level as it always has been). Those two numbers used to match up at 300, and with the expansion, they increased each according to its own pattern.<br />
<br />
Before the expansion, there was no level to riding skill at all, the faster mounts were just way more expensive, but that stunk for people who wanted multiples, so they patched a few months prior to the expansion introducing the skill ranks and settling most of the cost into that, maintaining the necessary investment to upgrade your mount, but not so much to diversify.<br />
<br />
Now we have riding at 300, combat at 350 &amp; trades at 375. I wouldn't count on combat &amp; trade skills being brought back into synch for any reason, so why does riding have to rise with a new expansion. Some kind of swimming mount might be interesting or neat, but is it necessary (especially when they can just put in something like a submarine to run like zeppelins &amp; boats).<br />
<br />
My bet is trades skills will go to 450 (provided level cap raises - and why wouldn't it with new zones? - to provide new gear/toys/enchants), combat skills to 400 at level 80, and riding will stay the course at 300, and someday they'll do the massive recoding they would need to let us fly in Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-28, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Karazhan I've actually only done once (not even full actually), I moved straight into Gruul's when I got back from a 2 month break, never done Mag either (Since when there an epic check when you enter the door to SSC? and even though my gear was questionable I was still high on the DPS charts over some other warlocks and mages in SSC gear)<br />
<br />
I was 375 mining and jewelcrafting as of expansions start, first 375 JC on my server with my guild funding me, and recently abandoned mining to pick up tailoring, I was in the middle of working on it when I quit my mage, try getting BOP Craftable Epics with Jewelcrafting ;) (they don't exist btw)<br />
<br />
I said I don't play it anymore, and I don't care, I play my Hunter now with my fiance and family on Laughing Skull, had too much guild drama on Norgannon to stick around.<br />
<br />
If you want to keep flaming me go ahead, and you say I'm the one trying to impress in an online forum, I never implied I had a &quot;leet SSC &quot;mage&quot;&quot;, I implied my main was a 70 mage with SSC experience and to get off my back for posting on my hunter.<br />
<br />
Boub, please just delete all posts pertaining the flaming, this conversation needs to get back on subject.</div></div><hr />

But recent bear and cat nerfs took the shit out of useful ferals.<br />
There was a good sig on the official forums from a bear tank:<br />
OUR NERFS WILL PLOT OUT THE SUN<br />
...then we will tank in the shade<br />
<br />

Funny how all three tank classes moan about how they are totally redundant compared to the others. Go to druid forums and you would swear only warriors could tank, go to warrior forums and you would swear only druids could tanks, go to paladin forums and depending on the post you read you would swear only paladins could tank, or paladins cant tank at all.<br />

Personally, I always prefer Warrior tanks, just because I've had really really bad experiences with druid tanks.. I mean I think I had one good run with one and that was Black Morass, Paladin tanks I'm enjoying for 5 mans though, they really seem to have some good abilities for that.</div></div><hr />
