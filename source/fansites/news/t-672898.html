MLG Wildcard WoW Tournament<br />
A select group of invited teams are presently battling it out on the Major League Gaming tournament realm for a final invitation spot in the 2009 MLG PC Circuit Anaheim World of Warcraft Tournament played on HP. One victorious team from this wildcard tournament will get a coveted invite to MLG Anaheim, November 6th-8th (http://www.mlgpro.com/pro-circuit/2009/index4.php), to compete for over $15,000 and three HP Firebird computers.<br />
<br />
This online tournament will continue over the next few days with a single group play format. The team with the best group record will be officially invited to participate in the Anaheim event. Also making this tournament more interesting and meaningful, the Complexity Gaming organization has announced (http://www.complexitygaming.com/index.php?c=news&amp;id=1285) that they will offer a sponsorship to the winner, paying the cost for the winning team to travel to Anaheim.<br />
<br />
Scores, video coverage with live casting and much more will be available on Gotfrag.com (http://www.gotfrag.com/wow/story/44636/). <br />

Cross-Realms Instances<br />
We are working on a system to allow cross-realm grouping, yes, as we have regularly seen complaints in the past regarding players having a hard time finding a group for the dungeon they want to run. We have seen a lot of success with the cross-realm battlegrounds and want to apply that to dungeons as well. While the current LFG system works alright, it's not really intuitive so a lot of players just avoid using it all together.<br />
<br />
We are still working on ironing out the details of this new system and plan to provide a more comprehensive breakdown on it in the future.<br />
<br />
Most of the issues that players feel this will cause are things that are already happening to some degree and we will monitor the situation and make changes as needed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20432624042-crossserver-grouping-really.html))<br />

Strange numbers in Tier 10 Set Bonuses on PTRs<br />
Yes. It is much more work to create a spell in the first than to change numbers in it, so we often implement them in two steps: core functionality and number tweaking.<br />
<br />
It may seem unpolished, but that's something you're going to encounter when dealing with betas, which is what a PTR build essentially is. Depending on when the data for the build gets pulled, we might be halfway through implementing something. The WoW team is far too large and churns out too much content for someone to go office to office to make sure everyone's stuff is 100% done and working before triggering a PTR build. We absolutely do that before making a retail build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20464486313-ok-i-just-gotta-ask-this.html))<br />
<br />
Trading Emblems of Conquest for Emblems of Triumph in 3.3<br />
There are no plans to do this. As much as the triumph emblems will be easier to obtain in the next content patch, that doesn't meant we want to give players every triumph item by farming conquest emblems now. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
Scourge Strike in 3.3<br />
The Shadow damage will be less if the physical part strikes for less. We took that into consideration when coming up with the numbers. On the other hand, the Shadow damage will strike for more if you have all of the talents that prop up Shadow damage, and that part can crit separately.<br />
<br />
From many reports it appears that the Scourge Strike on the PTR isn't working correctly, so most of what we are getting back right now are theorycrafted numbers, and some of those are wildly off. Let's get the ability working correctly and then the community can have another go at it. We're totally open to shifting some more damage from Shadow to physical. We're not open to titanic Scourge strike crits again, given that Unholy DKs already do so much damage from diseases and magic.<br />
<br />
The goal is for it to beat out two Blood Strikes or Obliterate. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20143783373-new-scourge-strike.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe the lfg system could take people by their roles and put the groups together itself. Since it seems that everyone is too lazy to do it themselves, especially the people marked as &quot;leader&quot;, someone just needs to put the groups together more often. Especially if there is going to be more people in lfg. Often there is enough people to make a group for a raid, but nobody wants to put it together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems that way on the surface, but if you think about it, it's a bit backwards.<br />
<br />
Divine Illumination is best used with Holy Light, but 35% more healing on Holy Light more or less just means 35% more overhealing on Holy Light. If you switch to FoL, you take advantage of the set bonus, but not of the mana reduction cooldown.</div></div><hr />

I lol'd at this. I think maybe they have Death Knights confused with Warlocks. You know, the whole &quot;massive damage&quot; while suffering DoT damage. Sounds a whole more like Warlocks than Death Knights to me. Massive damage.. Death Knights.. lolololol...</div></div><hr />

Now afaik, there wasn't a model for belts previously.<br />
I also noticed it appearing on the druid set, but none of the others. Interesting.<br />
<br />
Also, while I do like the sets, in what they are made to be, the druid shoulder anim seems to me to be badly animated, not much coherence or direction behind it, mostly haphazard distortions (other than the base opening/closing)</div></div><hr />

Because of their posture, the male shoulder leans to the right, so it makes it look higher.</div></div><hr />

Are you referring to the pulsing of the glowing &quot;eye?&quot; I watched the druid section several times to get a good look at it, and the eye pulses outward twice as the mouth opens, and that is all the movement that happens, and it simply repeats that way every time.</div></div><hr />

One of the huge fails of WOTLK is the gear design. Every single item in this expansion with very few exceptions looks boring. Sometimes green lvl 70 items look better than lvl 80 epix and that imo is a huge fail.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Divine Illumination is best used with Holy Light, but 35% more healing on Holy Light more or less just means 35% more overhealing on Holy Light. If you switch to FoL, you take advantage of the set bonus, but not of the mana reduction cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
With this bonus, simply rethink. With sacred shield up, FoL crits are near guaranteed. In raids, I'm hitting 7k fol crits (i'm only modestly geared), with this effect, you'll be hitting near 10k with FoL. This, in conjunction with the 50% mana reduction cost basically means you'll gain tons of mana back, whilst putting out massive (with respect to cast speed) heals.</div></div><hr />

Before it was a 15% chance to reset the cooldown on circle of healing when you cast flash heal. Well it looked okay, until I examined it in my head. My usual rotation would be 1) Circle of Healing -&gt; 2) Flash Heal -&gt; 3) Flash Heal -&gt; 4) Flash Heal -&gt; 5) Circle of Healing. If on the second flash heal this thing procs, chances are i will be half way casting my 3rd flash before i realise, then have to cancel spell and switch to CoH and in the end, no time is saved.<br />
<br />
With CoH producing a guarenteed effect, its much more reliable. I can do Circle of Healing -&gt; Flash Heal -&gt; Circle of Healing. Awesome! I'm hoping for a little buff which I can attach to power aura classic.<br />

I don't think it's a good change. Is it again the time for &quot;1 button priests&quot;? We have so many spells but some priests forget about it.<br />
I see the way some priests are healing: CoH -&gt; Flash heal (or Renew) -&gt; CoH. And this heal goes when only 1 or 2 characers actualy need it.<br />
<br />
It's good that they've changed 2 pieces bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the rogue set, it works really well with the undead rogue, even though it's not bad on the others either. Not a huge fan of the shoulders on some classes, I liked the preview with no shoulders more. Might grow into them eventually though. I also think there might be bit too much mist coming from the helmet, it becomes a center of attention instead of a flavor animation.<br />
<br />
The hunter set looks fine for most of the races without the helmet, while bit bland. The helmet fits for some races and for some it's out of place.</div></div><hr />

This is actually quite an amazing bonus. In certain fights Divine Plea was an issue to cast as the impact on ability to heal was too high, so you would pop Divine Plea (1min cd), Avenging Wrath (3 min cd) and any on use trinkets (2min cd). You never considered DP outside of this. With this change, it gives you another 'safe' way of using DP as well as a good oh sh*t button.<br />

<br />
While it is true that this may be one of the only decent times to use FoLs other than having trinkets or Avenging Wrath popped (assuming you're doing challenging hard modes of course, most FoL spammers just roflstomp through their normal modes with it, but it doesn't work for hards), I still think that on longer fights you're going to want to spam Holy Lights during that period anyway for the crazy regen. Divine Illumination + the old Holy Light libram is much much better regen than Divine Illumination + FoL for the obvious reason that you're saving more mana by using Holy Light to refund its higher base mana cost.<br />
<br />
Also as mentioned earlier - using it as another safe way to use Divine Plea is probably its best use by far.</div></div><hr />

Maybe the lfg system could take people by their roles and put the groups together itself. Since it seems that everyone is too lazy to do it themselves, especially the people marked as &quot;leader&quot;, someone just needs to put the groups together more often. Especially if there is going to be more people in lfg. Often there is enough people to make a group for a raid, but nobody wants to put it together.<br />
<br />
<br />
It can already do this, just turn auto add on... in fact thats all the meeting stones in front of instances were originally for... you would queue for a group for the dungeon and it would automatically put together the group... too bad it sucked at figuring out the right composition based on the people's specs... its better now but people still don't use it...</div></div><hr />

Sure, the idea of being called a war pig is cool and all, but having pig snouts sticking out like that just makes me laugh. Why not complete the look and have apples in their mouths? The only redeeming quality is the idea of having the actual horns of a Tauren sticking out to complete the helm, pretty awesome in that way i think. I still hold that the best warrior sets were the original T3 and T6. I just can't get enthused about pig shoulders.<br />
<br />
I do love the undead rogue set. I can also imagine it looking really good on a female belf. Mostly because the skinny bodies with large heads will only enhance the gimp... i mean geist ...appearence, with that helm.<br />
<br />
I also love the druid's animated shoulders, but i also think the helm is kind of cheesy. Almost looks like a fel hound helm, and it looked really ridiculous on the female nelf. Two words, Eye Stalks.<br />
<br />
For DK's i'm also betting the helm will look very much like the lich kings helm. I love how the shoulders are different on each side. Reminds me not only of the old Alliance plate PvP sets, but also AQ plate sets. It's kind of fun to not always be symmetrical imo. Looking forward to see the helms.<br />
<br />
The hunter set is just bad. Sure the Nerubian-stalker helm is unique, and sure hunters can be mythical unicorns in the new tier, but the rest is just bluuuh. Not only do the shoulders look like recolored Cryptstalker, but the rest of the armor lacks any detail or variation to make it stand out. It's just.... there. Rather disapointing.<br />

The only redeeming quality is the idea of having the actual horns of a Tauren sticking out to complete the helm, pretty awesome in that way i think.

I completely agree with you. They look stupid as hell, and I thought the goat heads of T8 were bad... I want evil looking skulls and spikes back for our armor...<br />
<br />
<br />
As it is, I'm gonna boycott these shoulders when they come out, if possible(meaning that stats on them aren't absolutely necessary), and go with a non-set DK looking shoulders that will probably exist, like the ones off Auriya 25.</div></div><hr />

I love all these sets, the hunter one being the only one that really disappointed me. aside from the helmet it's too similar to crypstalker in brown, and the brown skin is just bad. It looks like wood, or just some striped shirt.</div></div><hr />

It just looks silly to me. I can see they've spent time on it. I can see they wanted it to look awesome. But to me, they might as well have had the other shoulder have the boars butt on it, because the snouts sticking out just make me laugh too much.<br />
<br />
Just one person's opinion; probably shared by a few others.</div></div><hr />

Rogue set looks pretty cool<br />
Hunter helm is decent, shoulders look just like T3<br />
Druid helm is just weird, shoulders are neat<br />
I am upset with how miniscule the death knight shoulders are, Hopefully a Good ORIGINAL helm will make up for it, that means not a generic dome with a stupid skull on it.</div></div><hr />
