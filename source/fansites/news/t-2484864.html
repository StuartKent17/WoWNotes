World of Warcraft 15th Anniversary In-Game Rewards<br />
Blizzard posted a teaser video of two in-game rewards coming with the 15th Anniversary Event in October. The mount is called the Obsidian Worldbreaker. The Official Press Release (https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/celebrate-15-years-wowr-release-world-warcraftr-classictm-august) clarified just what to expect during the event as well.<br />
Later this year, Blizzard will be rolling out a series of in-game activities in World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth™in celebration of the game’s 15th anniversary, culminating in a 25-player raid (accessible through Raid Finder) that will pit players against some of the most iconic bosses from throughout the game’s history. Players who make it through this epic trial will earn the Obsidian Worldbreaker mount, designed to evoke the terrible visage of the ancient Dragon Aspect Deathwing the Destroyer.<br />

Doesn't make him iconic. He was a trash raid boss. And most people at the time said that it was an awful fight.</div></div><hr />

yes it does lmao, wtf are you talking about. you could be the most disappointing boss fight ever, you're still iconic if you're THE FACE OF THE EXPANSION AND IS ALSO THE LOGIN SCREEN AND THE EXPANSION NAME IS A DIRECT RESULT OF YOUR DOING AND YOU WERE ALREADY FAMOUS EVEN BEFORE SAID EXPANSION.</div></div><hr />

The mount isn't even that good looking imo. It's just a smaller Deathwing.<br />

I thought this too.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking they wanted to announce the 15th Anniversary Collector's Edition for pre-orders early because of logistics for the statues, and decided to announce this as well so that people woulldn't think there would be no free in-game rewards, only paid stuff.</div></div><hr />

That's right, the game is better off with out people like me who expect Blizzard to put out a quality product and a game that is fun and engaging . You need more sheep like you who will just buy what ever crap they put in the cash store and continue to give them money for a piss poor quality expansion . The shareholders love lemmings like you. Thanks for being part of the problem</div></div><hr />

<br />
Deathwing was great. People like to hate on him because it's when LFR was introduced.<br />
<br />
It also was the first time it felt like we legitimately were fighting something way out of our league. First damaging his back until you fought him when he was vulnerable. It was a smart way of doing the &quot;average adventurer kills big bad&quot; trope.</div></div><hr />

Because instead, there should be mounts that are all copies/recolors of the same generic<br />

Definition of iconic<br />
<br />
1 : of, relating to, or having the characteristics of an icon<br />
2a : widely recognized and well-established an iconic brand name<br />
b : widely known and acknowledged especially for distinctive excellence an iconic writer a region's iconic wines<br />
Widely known and infamous so yes, he's iconic. So take the loss like an Eleccybubb instead of whining like a ministabber.</div></div><hr />

Nope. Not iconic. Widely regarded as an awful raid boss and for ruining a good world.<br />
<br />
I take no losses. Only victories!. Except that 2-2 draw in Blitzball last night in FFX. Although was training a new Aurochs team of level 1s lol on PS4.</div></div><hr />

Dont feed him, he is just trying to ignite something. No meter what the game give, he will complain<br />
<br />
Eleccybubb is like that, he always will post negative stuff about the game no meter what happen to it.<br />

<br />
Are you serious? Do you know what iconic means? Doesn't matter if you liked the raid or not, Deathwing is easily one of the most iconic raid bosses in the series, just by virtue of being one of the most iconic characters.<br />
<br />
If the Lich King fight has sucked would you be saying, &quot;The Lich King is not an iconic raid boss?&quot; Seriously?</div></div><hr />

Doesn't matter if you liked the raid or not, Deathwing is easily one of the most iconic raid bosses in the series, just by virtue of being one of the most iconic characters.<br />

Absolutely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Neltharion the Earth-Warder, The Destroyer, Aspect of Death, The Worldbreaker, The Black Scourge, and Black Aspect of the Black Dragon Flight. An iconic character with a storied history. That IS different from his fight being iconic. Quite a few people hated the fight/s against Deathwing. There was very little iconic about the fight, the only thing/s that stuck out was who that character was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True. TBH I will probably just resub to do the event stuff, maybe level in Classic, and quit again. I can see myself using the mount in better expansions, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't waste your time. That clown just hates WoW, yet spends all day trolling WoW fansites. Pretty pathetic.</div></div><hr />

Oooor... ask Blizzard for a few free days, because you want to get the mount and can’t afford a sub right now. I did that for the Christmas presents once and got 7 days.<br />

I’m not a big fan of this mount. Don’t like the looks, but also don’t like the idea of riding an actual raid boss. What’s next, Jaina pet? I like the alabaster mounts better. Definitely getting those :)</div></div><hr />

Your idea of better, is different than my idea of better. So, ideally, we will never see you again, so your opinion is invalid.</div></div><hr />

That's because it's definitely just a reskinned model of the already available &quot;dragon&quot; mounts we have.</div></div><hr />

And yeah, Deathwing might not have made for a great raid boss at all (twice) but visually he's still one of WoW's most appealing and iconic raid bosses. A mount based on him is totally fine for an anniversary.</div></div><hr />

Lol......<br />
<br />
If you read carefully, they never say Deathwing is/was an iconic boss, given that they might include him since the mount is his incarnation. You can't argue though that he is an iconic lore character, we've been dealing with him since Vanilla, albeit not directly.</div></div><hr />

I suggest you look up the definition of “ lauded “ and any other biggly words prior to posting them in your edgelord posts. <br />
Heroic Deathwing was a decent end boss fight. Not as good as Firelands Heroic Rag , but ok. Nowhere near as bad as H Spine , esp at release.</div></div><hr />

I mean, don't get me wrong, floating around on a Yogg blob mount would be hilariously epic, but dragons make more sense.<br />

It's eleccybub what did you expect? a not negative comment from him? a guy who don't play wow anymore and it's full on FF XIV but somehow has the time to post a negative comment on almost every thread of this forum? At this point it's just sad.<br />
<br />
On another point, I love this mount and I love that they have done this!</div></div><hr />
