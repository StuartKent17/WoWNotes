Warlords of Draenor - Developer Interview<br />
The ReadyCheck podcast (http://www.readycheck.co.uk/) had the opportunity to talk with several developers recently. You can find a full transcript of the interview on their site (http://www.readycheck.co.uk/season-3-episode-2-q-a-holinka-hazzikostas/), and the highlights below:<br />
<br />
Arenas<br />
<br />
Arenas didn't fit the game as well back in Burning Crusade, as classes weren't designed to be balanced for 1v1 or 2v2 in PvP then, but things are better now.<br />
The arena history stats were removed from armory because they took up a lot of storage space and weren't used by many players. It might be possible to add some sort of history for Trial of the Gladiator.<br />
Solo queue arena is something the developers are looking at, but there are several challenges that would have to be overcome before it was possible. (The number of players for each role isn't balanced, having to queue until you find a decent group to play with, randomly created comps that aren't great, etc) <br />
The developers are aware that some players want skirmishes back, but the development time needed would take away from time spent on something else. Being able to do arenas without consequences would be nice though. <br />
Arena prep times might be slightly too long.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Patches involve an initial overhead no matter how many changes are in them, so more frequent patches to address PvP balance would slow down the creation and addition of new content. <br />
Hotfixes can also be used to help with balance and are much easier to do. <br />
Rapid changes are hard to keep up with, and small tweaks don't have a large impact on PvP, so these aren't the best ways to handle changes.<br />
Allowing people to solo queue for things greatly increases the participation rate, but it also increases toxic behavior. Hopefully the Group Finder in Warlords of Draenor will make it easier to find groups to do PvP with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor PvE<br />
<br />
The developers realize that there is still an audience for Burning Crusade level difficulty Heroic dungeons. Challenge modes were designed to be harder content, but the focus is on speed and not as much on having to use as much CC, so they don't capture the essence of Burning Crusade era Heroics.<br />
One idea that came up for Warlords of Draenor was offering a chance of LFR level rewards for completing hard dungeons with a deliberate pace. This would give players that wanted more challenging content a way to do harder content with friends and still be rewarded well. <br />
Mythic dungeons are also a possibility for the future, though none are planned right now.<br />
Warlords of Draenor raid bosses will continue to use a mix of familiar raid mechanics, new raid mechanics, and new tech to create interesting encounters. Siegecrafter Blackfuse is an example of a boss that combined familiar mechanics to make a fresh encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Misc<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor has a harder and darker story than Mists of Pandaria did.<br />
Warlords of Draenor improves the questing experience by showing the main story line in each zone on your UI and encouraging exploration. Outdoor content that isn't based on daily quests but still allows some progression will also help.<br />
The guild finder tools need an update, but it isn't likely to happen for Warlords of Draenor. Being able to do more things cross-realm will allow guilds to try out or find new members.<br />
There are no plans for going free to play right now, as they are happy with the current business model. <br />
There will be more expansions after Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Random Battleground Queue Times<br />
Faction imbalance is definitely something that's contributing to the lengthy queue times. That said, we agree that allowing Horde vs Horde and Alliance vs Alliance Random BG's isn't a great answer. We'll do it if it's absolutely necessary (Rated BG's allow for same-faction battles for exactly this reason), but we're going to look at all other options first. <br />
<br />
Honestly, even if we can't find another good answer, we're not sure queue times are so bad, at least at the moment, that same-faction Random BG's would be worth it. Horde vs Alliance, Orcs vs Humans, Elves vs Trolls etc. has long been a strong core of the Warcraft universe. We want queue times to be faster for everyone, but we also don't want to lose that.<br />
<br />
20 minute queues at peak hours makes BGs FAR less worth it than just doing dungeons and trading for honor.<br />
Definitely agree here, but that's part of a larger issue we've been discussing lately about the random BG reward system. I don't have any specifics to share just yet, but it's very much on our radar. We're actually hoping that whatever changes we can make along those lines will also have the side effect of helping queue times a bit (though again, we're still looking into more options there).<br />

Hi any plans to make all buffs passive auras like shaman buffs. I think buffing is not skillful ore interesting anymore.<br />
Buffs (like Mark of the Wild) don't really take up keybind space. They also have a perk that the caster can die. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423925865013985280))<br />

the death knight ability [Death Grip] has ben bugged on the two new maps since release, planing on fixing it this decade or what ?<br />
We have a fix but it requires a patch. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423881147257348096))<br />

Arcane Shot is a main culprit of Hunter specs feeling identical. One of the things being looked at?<br />
Yep, it is. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423623231082209280))<br />

For what purpose does an attack over 30% max hp cancel lightwell ticks?<br />
I believe it was originally so that it would be ignored by tanks, and left to raid members. I'm not sure that that's needed now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423543387048800256))<br />

Any chance you could make Enhance's Feral Spirit into something dangerous again in WoD? They've been pretty poor in MoP.<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423613151947415552))<br />

Imp is crap at doing that, time it take it to switch and start casting, is a lost. Pets should switch instantly<br />
Passion is a great thing. However, I think it may be clouding your view here. For example, Imp's recast time is zero loss. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423907898276601856))<br />
You need to recheck your data - I been playing warlock since day 1, and I know for a fact imp is slow at switching.<br />
You're missing the point; the fact that it takes time to switch doesn't matter. That time is not lost DPS. Imps use energy. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423910076177321984))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Are you going to do something to tailor/trinket/enchant proc stacking in wod? encourages popping evry cd in opener cos procs lineup<br />
Yes. We'll be reducing the number of stacking procs and cooldowns from a variety of sources. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423904280311906304))<br />
<br />
DPS player wants to try healing for the 1st time: his basic gear changes to Int, but has no Spirit. Awful mana regen. Thoughts?<br />
He needs to get jewelry made for healers. That's a huge change from today where he needs to get a full set of healing gear. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422844465770795008))<br />
But does it concern you that less informed players may think they're &quot;ready&quot; for healing once gear conveniently changes to Int?<br />
At worst they try it, go OOM extremely quickly, ask around, or someone tells them, that they should get some Spirit. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423064938442010625))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
How are old food/gems/chants going to work post stat squish? 300 stat food is massive with ilvl 90 stats.<br />
Stats get squished everywhere, including all of those places you listed. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/423057853427904512))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
can u cut this out in paper for someone whos main language isnt english? I dont get it. Resilience removed in WoD?<br />
In MoP, damage is too high for player health pools so resil lowers damage. In WoD health pools will be relatively bigger. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423184542099197952))<br />
how &quot;relatively&quot;? In Mop it feels like health pools would need to be doubled to keep pace with damage.<br />
Starting point we're playing with is doubling health, crits are 150% (down from 200%) and healing up 50% (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423232352970502144))<br />
Wonder how that's gonna fix, going by only health pools it results in slower kills, still spiky as hell dmg/heal.<br />
It's possible that some damage reduction will have to remain. Point is to minimize it as much as possible. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423188321074831361))<br />
The numbers are just too big right now. It feels crappy to hit a mob for 200k and a player for 40k. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423188585714438144))<br />
less damage, more health and more healing? Maybe if the healers get interruptable again but with less interrupts against dd-caster<br />
The health increase is a lot more than the healing increase. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423254401705197570))<br />
Yes, more health increase then healing increase. But I see no damage increase! Only less crit damage!<br />
little to no resilience is a HUGE damage increase (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423486791937572865))<br />
<br />
Will ALL crits be 150%, or will this just mean stack haste/readi/mastery in pvp?<br />
Current thinking is all crits. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423254518256513024))<br />
<br />
theres a rumor going around that you said 1k is going to be the cutoff this season.... is 1k going to be cutoff?<br />
Yes, we will only be considering players with a rating of 1000 or higher when determining rewards. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423930199835549696))<br />
1000 is the point where players have commit to more than just trying arena. The # of rewards will be similar to past seasons. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423930521186336768))<br />
<br />
what do you think of the idea for separate ratings for different specs?<br />
I would have to give it more thought. My concerns would be confusion and possible exploitation. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/423534707129610240))<br />

There has already been so much comments for something other than speed. Not sure where the developers think speed will make it fun especially for those group of friends that just want a non-raiding alternative to LFR. The developers themselves said that speed didnt interest those wanting difficulty as well. This brings up the other concern of what is going on with LFR being demoted to &quot;tourist&quot; mode for those that want to see the content rather than spend their time in there for the long term grind of gear. Cant have alternatives for non-raiders if LFR is the better source of gear and an easier one at that. If LFR gets nerfed then a Vortex Pinnacle difficulty heroic more than justifies LFR level rewards.<br />
<br />
The only thing I could think is the developers trying to save a higher difficulty level for later to rejuvenate the launch heroics at the end with something like mythic which becomes moot in the follow expansion. Also a speed run is the void that challenge modes are supposed to fill. Should also only be available in preform to avoid drama in random queue groups with all the more reason that it is designed for premade groups in the first place.</div></div><hr />

The problem with this is that only a 10 ilvl jump between difficulties isn't enough, as stated in the past. The gear rewards don't feel big enough with just 10 ilvls. They had said that the right number feels around 13 ilvl jumps between new tiers. Secondly, The problem with challenge modes are the fact that they focus on time. Nothing hard about tossing some CC or Stealth around to beat a timer. The BC Heroics were built on something much more complex. I hope we do see a Normal Heroic and Mythic difficulty in our 5 mans. More content and more lifespan with the Mythic part instead as gear is set at a certain ilvl but still offer plyer power rewards over &quot;Transmog&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Expect that current challenge modes are being done without a true healer just using for example an elemental shaman or hey you can go in with a three man team and still get gold. The current challenge modes just aren't that hard and just comes down to knowing what to do to bypass whatever mechanics you can and how much aoe the group can do.<br />

I'm wondering the same thing. How do you make a story darker without changing the game's T rating, and will there be moments like the Purge of Dalaran that will be even more morally ambiguous that makes the story &quot;harder&quot; for players to settle on? It'd have to be borderline M to meet that criteria.</div></div><hr />

M rating pretty much just means the game has &quot;intense&quot; violence or sexual content.<br />

You don't need an M rating to tell a mature story.<br />

You do understand that's right in line with mop at release right? Back when mop released a fresh 90 would be able to pick up a few 450 ilvl blues before going into heroics (463) which would lead into MSV (489) which would lead into HoF/ToES (496) and finally heroic raids (502-516).</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but that is PRECISELY what caused the MOP power creep XDDD<br />

That's cool, but MoP had a pretty dark storyline itself. But of course, some dipshits can't get past &quot;OMG Kung FU Pandas are for Children!!&quot;, even despite MoP having some incredibly dark moments, and having a greater focus upon the Horde / Alliance conflict than the other expansions.<br />

I also like the comments on the 1st page going on about how speedruns don't equate to TBC, and that Blizzard are missing the point, even though the paragraph directly above the one they quote says &quot;but the focus is on speed and not as much on having to use as much CC, so they don't capture the essence of Burning Crusade era Heroics.&quot;<br />
<br />

So Blizzard are well aware that speed has nothing to do with the supposed difficulty of TBC heroics. Which weren't that hard anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes; It was imbalanced in PvP - but people felt like it was actually worth doing. 2's at least gave rewards (And had the same issues it had now - Honk honk.) and it's getting old that I see nothing but BC gladiator drakes over Cataclysm/MoP ones. Only WoTLK one I see now ways most likely due to model issues is Wrathful.<br />
The only reason more classes are viable is because of bad game mechanics that make it unfun. (Lava Burst Globals, Stupid Tanky Warriors, Ice Lance Spam, Unhealable Unholy Damage, LolHunterCC/Damage, Cyclone Spamming.) <br />

After two patches of doing nothing but this crap I have no idea why the hell they think this is fine for an MMORPG end game PvP system.<br />

<br />
After they lose 1.3kk subs down to 8kk 2013, their profit goes down to 90kk Dollar - down from 2xx kk Dollar.<br />
<br />
When WoD is finally released at end August - mid September, the subs would be beelding out maybe to 5-6 kk , so 1.5 - 2.5k lesser subs than now.<br />
This would make the profit fall down near zero. <br />
<br />
WoD Launch would give some extra money, cus of the -in best case- 2kk sold copys. But it will be like MoP, when MoP released subs climbed up from 9kk to 10,3 k. We all know how much subs are right now, about 7-7,5kk , near 3 million losses. The subs will go maybe up again to 7kk, but after few months it goes down, like it goes down since WotLK. It will not take so long when they hit the 5kk subs, and they have to reduce turnover much to be profit with 5kk subs.<br />
<br />
Why do u think they said at blizzcon they want to release every year a new expac? Cus they knew that the subs will be falling down to the point where there is no profit - and this is the main reason for a joint-stock company.<br />
<br />
The game is getting really old, there are every few months new MMOs who maybe are not the size as WoW is, but enough to lure some bored and weary wow players to try it. Maybe for few months, maybe forever (=they are not coming back to wow). <br />
If Wildstar and Eso and Destiny only get 2kk WOW Players, which is not exaggerated much, what do u think would happen if at this time the subs go down to 4kk..</div></div><hr />

The massive participation in arenas for TBC was due to the fact that the arena gear was actually BiS for PvE, especially weapons for melee. Will always remember doing arenas to get at least weapons and gloves (the effects like increasing crusader strike dmg, etc...).</div></div><hr />

They forgot some important thing about TBC: Not every TANK had an aoe tankspell back in the days and you know what? AGGRO was a problem, even for healers god damnit. THIS was the challenge. Looking at your group and overthink what we had there. A warlock and a tankwarrior..oh fuck here comes the seed of AoeAggroPainInTheAss. Cleave hit only 3 and thunderclap 4 targets. Only paladins had a godly aoe tankspell. This was hard. Tanking as a warrior in shattered citadel with less cc or even NO cc sometimes. But is was goddamn fun.

The quote in the news summary is: &quot;One idea that came up for Warlords of Draenor was offering a chance of LFR level rewards for completing hard dungeons with a deliberate pace.&quot;; the actual quote from the interview is: However, in Challenge Mode right now, the focus is so much on speed you don’t get that feeling of having to go through and mark your CC, polymorph that, sap that, for example. But we’re actually exploring the possibility of having Challenge Modes, as well as the speed component, also offer a chance at some gear rewards, LFR quality perhaps, so someone who doesn’t want to do LFR can do some hard content with friends and get epics that way.<br />
<br />
In NEITHER case, does it say &quot;we wanted to have a speed challenge that offers LFR rewards&quot;. What it DOES say is: We want to have an option for players that want harder heroics but it needs a time component to it.</div></div><hr />

That's what I initially wanted as well, but I really can't come up with any scenario where that works. The mobs in challenge modes hurt, there are a lot of 1 shot mechanics. If I went in there with my group and we just took our time and cc everything and single target mobs down one at a time....that's easier, not to mention less fun. Ignore the time limit, current challenge mode dungeons are harder than bc heroics.<br />
<br />
They most certainly are not.</div></div><hr />

It might be possible to add some sort of history for Trial of the Gladiator.<br />
<br />
More likely, they were removed because they were hopelessly corrupted. I have characters that have never done arena that had all sorts of ridiculous (non-zero) arena stats.</div></div><hr />

The problem is ALL about audience. You cannot design a ´heroic´ dungeon and have it be based around PUGs and LFG.<br />
<br />
Let me give you some ideas about what makes a heroic dungeon heroic<br />
<br />
1. Needs CD - If there are 4 mobs alive doing damage, it is too much for your healer.<br />
2. Needs priority in kill order<br />
3. Timed!! - No not with some stupid UI timer, but instead with pats. You have 4 mobs you need to kill.. 4 other mobs pat into that group, then leave.. You have just enough time after the pat leaves to kill the first 4 mobs before the pats return. If one of the original mobs is alive, it is doable, but stressful and the tank needs to pick up the 4 pats.<br />
4. DPS need to do stuff - Not only with kill order, but with picking up adds, kiting, interacting with the environment etc.<br />
<br />
The problem is all of that stuff requires coordination, and cannot and SHOULD NOT be available in LFG. Cata heroics were perfect.. the problem was they were available to pugs who didn´t have the coordination or patience to learn them. This is especially true of DPS. in LFG and PUGs, you literally cannot count on dps to hopefully dps the right target. That is the reason Cata heroics were fails.. they were pugged by dps who did nothing but dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you force the use of methodical pulls and CC? <br />
<br />
One way is multiple healers in each pack. But why not just pull everything, chain AoE stun, and AoE everything?<br />
Okay, so make the healers immune to stun. But they would still need to be interruptible. So now the groups with a prot pally can still pull everything and aoe.<br />
Okay, so make the incoming damage intense. Bring an absorb healer (looking at you, disc priests) and a prot pally so you can still pull everything and aoe.<br />
Okay, so nerf absorb healing (needs to happen, anyway) and have 8 hard-hitting mobs in each pack. Now you have to bring dps that have cc. Leave those warriors, druids (root is only good against melee), death knights, and monks behind.<br />
<br />
So either they make the dungeons so challenging to the wrong group comp that people are frustrated and complain loudly...or make it easy enough that a well-built group still just AoEs all the shit.</div></div><hr />

Make the dungeon ramped up and give the players a once a week limit before the limit is reset, and make it based on the individual not the group so people can group with different people and it wont matter. I don't understand why they didn't do this in the first place, time trial anything sucks.</div></div><hr />

We dont want a herioc 5man with any sort of time component. Casuals tend to take random breaks and should be able to do that without feeling the stress to come back super fast. Also, all sorts of mechanics to make a dungeon harder outside mechanics from the bosses removes all RP elements from the dungeon and its bosses. This is a MMORPG game is it not? This is important for the goal to make a 5 man to feel like a mini herioc max raid, thats what casuals want. We want some cool shit 5 man herioc dungoen with maybe some little RP history and fun hard gameplay.</div></div><hr />

Almost every class can CC, AOE, interrupt, self-heal and so on, in TBC it wasn't like that and that's the reason why some dungeons were impossible without particular classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes me wonder when was the last time that ANYONE at Blizz tried playing a shadow in 2vs2...let alone 1vs1?????????</div></div><hr />
