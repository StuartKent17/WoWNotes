Patch 3.0.8 Bugs<br />
According to these posts, these bugs will be fixed within a few days and developers are working actively on a patch. This post might be updated as more bugs get reported.<br />
Battle For Wintergrasp Update<br />
We’re actively investigating Wintergrasp impacting realm stability and we’re working to resolve these issues. If needed, we may temporarily disable the Battle for Wintergrasp on all realms. If this should happen, players will still be able to venture into the zone, but will not be able to participate in the Battle itself. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/14498161183-battle-for-wintergrasp-disabled.html))<br />
<br />
[US] Account-Wide Death Knight Creation<br />
It was anticipated that with the release of the current patch, 3.0.8, players would be able to create a new death knight on any realm within their region. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, we are not able to make this available as of yet. We do anticipate making this available in the near future and will do our best to keep everyone informed of when this becomes available.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that when implemented restrictions will still apply to new, non-transfer realms such that death knights cannot be created on those realms until you level a character to level 55 on that realm or until transfer restrictions are removed.<br />
<br />
[...] Please be aware that select players are currently able to create death knights on realms other than the one they currently have a level 55+ character on while others are still unable to do so at this time. We are currently working to address this issue and anticipate this to be corrected as of tonight’s rolling restarts. We will post additional updates after the completion of the restarts. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14498530635-accountwide-death-knight-creation-update.html))<br />
<br />
Human Female Animation<br />
There are some human female animation errors, specifically when using two-handed weapons or shooting with a ranged weapon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14318781195-minor-bugs-in-next-patch.html))<br />

Howling Blast has a 5 sec cooldown. There is a tooltip error where it appears that the spell has no cooldown, but the game will still enforce one. We hope to hotix the UI soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14498471268-howling-blast-status.html))<br />
There is a known bug on Obliterate rank 5 and possibly Empower Rune Weapon, depending on when that change was made. We should be able to hotfix those soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14498529761-obliterate-rp-bug-fixed.html))<br />

We had to make a change to the new warlock summoning mechanic at the last second to prevent an exploit. Our apologies to all the law-abiding warlocks who have to suffer with a painful cooldown on your summon in order to fix this problem. We plan on getting the Ritual working correctly as soon as possible. You won't have to put up with a 2 minute cooldown for more than a few days. Standard caveats apply that this could change for any number of reasons, but we wanted to keep you informed of our plans at this time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14498471265-ritual-of-summoning-status.html))<br />
The Felhunter and a couple of other demons should have significantly gained health. If you Felhunter was at 8K yesterday he should be closer to 16K today. The exact number will depend on your gear and talents. We plan on hotfixing the warlock pet health. I don't want to throw around any more numbers because it's going to depend a lot on lock gear and talents. Unfortunately sometimes things work differently between our servers and live. It's a bug and we will get it fixed. <br />

<br />
A) Illustration of dragon soul: Each time you cast a damaging of healing spell you gain 20 spell power for the next 10s, stacking up to 10 times.<br />
<br />
B) Majestic dragon figurine: Each time you cast a spell you gain 18 spirit for the next 10s, stacking up to 10 times.<br />
<br />
Both these trinkets do not apply the stacking buff when: Lifebloom, rejuvenation, wildgrowth, hurricane, thorns, motw are used. Currently only works on nourish, regrowth and healing touch i.e the spells with cast time. <br />
<br />
Illustration of dragon soul buff stack is also getting refreshed with moonfire tick, which is not consistent with the trinket description, as hot ticks never refreshed the buff stack previously.</div></div><hr />

working as intended for all but moonfire tick iirc..<br />
new illustration is supposed to get charge ONLY via direct damage/direct healing spell, not via hot/dot spell (hence this severarly limites the use of this trinket for affli lock, but oh well)..<br />
i suppose that the majestic dragon figurine should have undergone the same changes, having the same mechanic :P</div></div><hr />

Nope. Even in regular maintenances, when no patch is applied, you very often can't even login at 8 AM, because they do maintenance also on login server.</div></div><hr />

About the enGB Patch, I'm pretty sure I got lazy and just mirrored the one from wirebrain.com for this one. I know the admin of this site and he's probably the most reliable source out there when it comes to patches, the MD5 matches between the two versions so I wouldn't be too worried. They just didn't update the login servers yet, it happens when you patch too early and not from an official source.</div></div><hr />

Still unable to validate game version at 10 am. Will be interesting to see in an hour when the servers are usually up. Edit: Do note that I also downloaded from the source at MMO-champion. (Not rapidshare.) The Blizzard Downloader, was, as usual, slow as a turtle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, even if I'm totally confident about my mirrors, keep in mind that downloading from third party sites is always risky. The risk might be very low (0.01%) but not using the Blizzard Downloader just because you're lazy / it's a bit slow is still stupid. (Yup, no other words. :p)</div></div><hr />

<br />
it doesnt currently ask you to download a new patch if you login with out the launcher. ( well it doesnt with my client anyway) but if you do login using the launcher then it does auto matically download the patch using the blizzard downloader. Which i have now done and i am not getting any errors when i launch and can login ( servers still down) so i am guessing they have now updated the login servers.<br />
<br />
also noted they have now got the MOTD back to the right one.. can only guess it was an error or they rolled the servers right back to pre lk to install the current patch ( this might be bs tho :) )</div></div><hr />

Is this a bug that you are working on or was the change not implemented?</div></div><hr />

I had a ticket in for a misloot. Its been days, and a GM finally answers it. I'm sitting there, running around IF. The stupid bubble was flashing up at the top of my screen and I did not notice it. There was no sound, nothing in my chat window. Almost nothing to draw my attention to it. It just sat there blinking. When I finally noticed it, the GM had left. Who knows how long I'll have to wait for another one</div></div><hr />

If you have a prot paladin in raid it'll depend on who's buff went up first. Improved Devotion Aura has 6% healing increase as well and they dont' stack so generally the paladin buff stays on top.<br />
