Cataclysm Beta<br />
We'll make it very clear when the time comes that the beta has started and what to expect if you are selected. Currently, with the StarCraft II beta, players who were selected were sent an email and were asked to log into their Battle.net account to access the beta download. Cataclysm beta should work similarly. We'll do our best to be as clear in the process as we can so that everyone can hopefully avoid the more unscrupulous schemers who attempt to phish for accounts.<br />
<br />
Just to be clear now, we have not started any beta invites at this time. Please be cautious of any emails you may receive until we say otherwise. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25171671130/common-give-us-cata-news/))</div></div><hr />

blizz has NOT started the beta yet. Blizz WILL make a big announce WHEN it's starting. and if you get picked, they ASK YOU to log into your B-net account on your own, over the homepage. they WON'T send you a link with your invitation.<br />

The &quot;Screenshot of the Day&quot; has been pretty horrible so far on the whole.<br />
<br />
I do like the pic of SW bank though... looking nice and posh. Desolace looks beautiful (!) but is it me or do those boars look very low rez?<br />

<br />
<br />
The AH is actually in that picture. ;)<br />
<br />
And I'm noticing a few people getting disappointed by these screenies. Let me be the douche that delivers the wake-up call: Most of the areas are going to look the same as the current game. I dont mean they'll have the same bushes, I mean it's still WoW. We're not going to install the Xpac and be looking at Crysis all of a sudden.<br />
<br />
2 weeks of it and it'll feel like it does now, cept hopfully we'll be going goofy for the new raids. Honestly, lower the expectations a bit. It'll keep you around in a 2003 graphics engine powered game a little longer. :)</div></div><hr />

Dunno if someone said it but the AH is now right across the bank with a big entrance, the sideline (and current) entrance is closed in cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

I'm not at end game stuff at all yet though so I still have fun to be had. ;) And I kinda like the whole 'cartoony' look Blizzard are giving to WoW... makes it seem original, but at the same time soooo many people just don't like it.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy the cartoony look as well, but as you can tell (maybe you've been there already) but the further into these expansions we get,the more the graphics change. When I first landed in Howling Fjord, I noticed that everything down to the rocks was more detailed. Higher poly counts etc. Then I stumbled on the Vyrkul who just looked amazing. They don't look the slightest bit cartoony. But... the characters we play as sure as hell do, which is my actual dilemma here. Couple days ago they posted a screenshot of a goblin drinking with some gnomes and it... wow. I couldn't tell which looked more out of place but both of the races looked like they were photoshopped into the picture. They looked like they were each from 2 completely different games. It's becoming annoyingly obvious =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I commented on your comment about that screenshot. :P You're right though, three different expansions into one game... everything will look really, really weird and it's just going to get worse if Blizzard don't just decide to get their act together and update EVERYTHING. I think that's the point of Cataclysm, but I don't think they're updating old character models, for example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the far end is the exit, then it is correct. Think of it like you are entering the vault itself to get your money, and they added teller booths to service you, within it.<br />
<br />
Also, there could be another Vaulted door just like that which we don't see, which is closed, to represent the real vault ( probably several of them to represent the guild banks)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually if you look at the rims of the door the larger rim is towards the gap the door is supposed to close. So if it swings towards the right to close the door then it wont shut, us the smaller rim thats supposed to enter the open way is AFTER the bigger outter rim.<br />
<br />
Now if the door swinged towards the right and then pivoted on its axis to the left then the door would close :P Somehow i doubt thats what they meant to do, they just have the door that way so the art can be seen.</div></div><hr />

That's what happened to me. Pretty disappointing, but I can't really complain. I heard the first batch had a bigger error, where if you were logged into your bnet account you couldn't see the ticket page, or something.</div></div><hr />

they charge $10 for a 3 day tournament with awful commentators (except vhell, he's decent) and even though they have a tight shedule with teams playing simultaneously they manage to show us the same 3 idiotic commercials OVER AND OVER AGAIN even when there still games running.<br />
<br />
for the last ~two hours servers were down (not mlg's fault)... now they're finally up, they show 1 (!) bo5 and go to a commercial break again;<br />
&quot;MLG|Shrew:<br />
Alright so heres the plan: The crew just went to grab some food and the broadcast will reconvene at about 6:15 with Skill Cap Central and Loaded Black. Afterwards we have a *SURPRISE* SC2 exhibition match with some live commentary!&quot;<br />

BUT 150$ for a ticket ? are they insane ?<br />

That's not a whole lot, for 2 full days of Blizzard fun. It is when that's your complete monthly salary... I'm coming from Europe, imagine the cost of that :o</div></div><hr />
