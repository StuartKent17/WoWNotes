Less than a week remains to finish everything that is changing in Patch 6.0.2 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4315-Patch-6-0-Reminders-Warlords-of-Draenor-Healing-Blue-Tweets-DLC-457)!<br />
Patch 6.0.2: The Iron Tide is scheduled to crash into Azeroth on Tuesday, October 14. Featuring new content heralding the Iron Horde incursion, updates to the skills and abilities for every class, and a host of gameplay adjustments, this overture to Warlords of Draenor is coming at you armed to the teeth.<br />
<br />
Treacherous Developments<br />
The Dark Portal in the Blasted Lands has turned blood red. Hundreds of strange-looking orcs are violently pouring into Azeroth, killing everything that stands in their path. Nethergarde and Okril’lon have already fallen, and while the Horde and the Alliance moved as quickly as they could to get reinforcements to their people, they are too late. The Iron Horde invasion has begun.<br />
<br />
In this desperate hour, King Wrynn and Warchief Vol’jin have called upon their greatest champions to join the front lines in the Blasted Lands and do whatever they can to stop the Iron Horde . . . before the rest of Azeroth falls before them.<br />
<br />
Word of this surprise attack sends players rushing to the Blasted Lands to reckon with the barbarous infiltration. After the fall of a high ranking Iron Horde general named Gar’mak Bladetwist, you’ll report what you’ve witnessed in the Blasted Lands to King Wrynn or Warchief Vol’jin. It’s apparent to both the Horde and the Alliance that this is only the first salvo in a much larger conflict, and the only way to win is to take the fight directly to the Iron Horde . . . by journeying through the Dark Portal into Draenor.<br />
<br />
The Infiltration of Blackrock Spire<br />
An advance party of Iron Horde forces has barged right out of the Blasted Lands and pushed all the way to Blackrock Mountain, where they found refuge and supplies in Upper Blackrock Spire. There can be only one response: the Alliance and the Horde of Azeroth must face this iron incursion head on.<br />
<br />
Available to level-90 characters for a limited time, this specially revamped five-player version of Upper Blackrock Spire sets the stage for the coming counterstrike against the Iron Horde. Here, you will face Orebender Gor'ashan, Kyrak, and Commander Tharbek as you begin to take the fight to the enemy and sharpen the skills—and swords—you’ll need to succeed on an unwelcoming alien world.<br />
<br />
Prepare yourself. Draenor is waiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a time limited level 90 version of UBRS for the launch event; once WOD launches, it'll be gone and will be replaced with the level 100 version.<br />
<br />
Anwyays, nice to finally know we will have some new content in a few days. The long drought is finally coming to an end!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's like the Theramore scenario. It will be available at level 90 until Warlords drops in a month, then it'll go back to being level 100 Heroic</div></div><hr />

Man, 6.0 will bring like no content at all, you will have time to check out new talents and spells maybe but thats it, it will get you busy for couple of days maybe tops, you will have 3 weeks for Borderlands at least, good enough for 1 walkthrough before WoD, cant wait for it my self :)</div></div><hr />

3. Is this a scaling event (meaning it will start with something small and develop to something huge and then launch?<br />

Sadly, I'm not sure you'll get that interesting happening with this poorly done fan fiction, time travel story but look at it this way. After 14 months of nothing for $15 a month, gamers will take whatever they can get.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, I was hoping that was the case. I still haven't caught that stupid treasure lizard yet, now I can take my time and work on it.

Can't bloody wait, this is shaping up to be one of the best pre-patches ever! (Didn't experience Wrath or BC, though Cataclysm was a good launch in my opinion, simply due to the ginormous amount of content we received, and just for a pre-patch).<br />
<br />
This timing sucks for me, however, as I won't get the freedom to play too much for the first two weeks, due to major exams I've got going on. :(</div></div><hr />

They've given plenty of notice, and if you've been on this site for more than 5 minutes you would've known it would be around this date. You can do all silvers in an evening with a PUG group, so 1 reset is plenty of time</div></div><hr />

Hmmm. Not sure when the installers will be converted to use CASC sorry. It won't have both MPQ files and CASC. It'll be either one or the other.<br />
<br />
All your MPQ files should be converted once 6.0.2 hits so if your installing MPQ files right now just let it go ahead and finish.<br />
<br />
I've haven't been able to confirm how much more we need to download for 6.0.2 because of difficulties with the CASC file format / NGDP patching system.<br />

Pre-patch files are around 11 GB and in CASC file format already (in the data , config and indices folders of the Data folder)</div></div><hr />

The loot dropping in the temporary lv.90 UBRS is more of a &quot;bonus&quot; as part of the pre-launch event, since once WoD is released these lv.90 550 blues will be gone permanently due to UBRS becoming a lv.100 dungeon (this also means the old UBRS that has been in the game since release in 2004 will be gone forever in similar ways that vanilla-Naxxramas was gone when WotLK patch came).</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that this is gear that at least will swap depending on your spec; pre-WoD gear won't change with your spec. I don't mind the 550 blues if it means I don't have to waste time getting a feral set to level with.</div></div><hr />

They disabled CRZ for the Barrens for the entire duration of patch 5.3 when there was an even there. I'd expect them to do the same now.</div></div><hr />

If you are on a PVE server should not matter as I think they are also going to enable the no accidental PVP flagging system..</div></div><hr />

Look just because he/she said they didnt have time doesnt automatically mean they have been lazy on WoW 24/7,we have other commitments aswell like family and life and jobs we cant all be on the game 24/7 like you,why people cant get that through to their thick heads is beyond me!<br />

If you don't have time, fine, don't do it. But don't show up at the last minute and complain their isn't enough time.<br />
<br />
They have given plenty of notice and time do it, and anyone that is worried or rushing now has been slacking far too long.<br />

<br />
Are the changes you've done to your current gear (reforging, upgrades, gems) being removed and items reverted to stock, or will they stay when the patch comes? If the items get normalized to stock I will lose like 40% crit on my fury warrior which would suck.<br />
Reforging - Removed and all gear reverted.<br />
Gems - Squished along with everything else but the number of sockets remain the same.<br />
Upgrades - Stay in place you can now upgrade anything you have not yet with Lesser Charms (50 charms per upgrade).<br />
<br />
Worth remembering that your hit and expertise will get converted to DPS stats.<br />
<br />
Also the squish seems to be VERY much in favour of the player, running round timeless isle the Elites at the top of the isle fell like the Elites at the bottom now.<br />

<br />
Really....<br />
<br />
This is not enough time?<br />

Or it could be that people had no idea that the title was going away. It's not like it needs to go away. The green fire quest itself isn't being removed. What, will the fight become trivial? If so, great - I'll get my ungeared warlock alt their green fire. If it's not trivial, why's the title going away and why couldn't they tell us? <br />
<br />
It's false scarcity and it's a bunch of sanctimonious people tsk-tsking people who had no reason to guess that it was going away when there's no reason for it.</div></div><hr />

I am just like you, I have farmed up to 553 ilvl with no pvp gear and found out about OpenRaid. I am hoping to find a raid for the achievement, but everyone seems to require the achievement to get into a raid or wants 570+ ilvl. My guild server xfered and all the new connected realms are really bad and lack guilds still raiding too.</div></div><hr />

I only got mine last week (finally) because I'm on a dead server in a dead guild and I have to rely on things like OpenRaid or Oqueue to get groups and the problem is most of those groups ask for ridiculous gear levels. I've still never even seen Ra-den or set foot in a challenge mode dungeon either; first thing I'm going to do when the expansion hits is find a good guild and maybe even transfer to another realm. I'm tired of missing out on so much stuff. :)</div></div><hr />

I haven't. I don't work regular hours and joining a guild that does this shit would be pointless. Why should I be given a raid spot I can't fill on a regular basis?</div></div><hr />

If you knew there is a title for it you also knew it was going to be unobtainable in 6.0. That is because there is no title yet, the only reward is the green fire. They announced few months ago that if you complete the quest line before 6.0 (while it is still somewhat challenging) you will get a special title for it. It was all explained on the same blue post.</div></div><hr />

You make it sound like life ends when you become a family, I got two daughters 4 and 7, a house that needs upkeep, a job and I still manage to have hobbies, one of them being a gamer. While I may not be able to sit in front of the PC for 8 hours a day, I find enough time to experience the whole package of WoW from raids to challenge modes, I launch the game 3 times a week and I've done all challenge modes gold, heroic raids and everything else. <br />
<br />
So from my perspective, what you wrote is just a bad excuse.</div></div><hr />

But he has a point. They had the chance to. Longer than during any content ever. There were two full arena seasons while 5.4 was live. At some point the game just has to move on. It's hardly Blizzard's or our fault that they didn't clear, and I dare saying they probably didn't even want to until now that things are getting patched out, which is pathetic. Not the kind of player this game needs to survive.</div></div><hr />
