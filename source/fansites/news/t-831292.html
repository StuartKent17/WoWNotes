Live Hotfixes List Update Soon

Live Hotfixes List Update Soon<br />

We've gotten behind on updating the list as a result of 4.0.6 patch notes flyin' out the door. We'll try to make sure we post this past week's changes soon.<br />

Basic Raiding Tactics (by Aear @ EU-Bloodhoof)<br />
A few days ago a very nice picture describing basic raiding tactics appeared on Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/ez6ud/basic_raiding_tactics/), I didn't really have time to post it because of all the 4.0.6 crazyness lately but it's definitely worth a look if you tend to just smash buttons and hope that everything will be ok when you're in raid. (We all do that anyway)<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 4.0.6 Cinematics Menu<br />
The Cinematics menu on the login screen has been updated with Patch 4.0.6, I'm sure you never noticed this option in the first place and you should use it more often because WoW cinematics are even more awesome than bunnies. <br />
<br />
<br />

Normal Dungeons / LFD Changes in 4.0.6<br />
In 4.0.6, we've made a few adjustments so that players will be able to queue for the normal versions of Throne of the Tides and Blackrock Caverns after hitting level 85. While these dungeons will not be added to your Random Dungeon pool, you'll still have the option to queue for them individually. <br />
<br />
[...] As Throne of the Tides and Blackrock Caverns are not max-level dungeons, it's true that they won't provide reputation from faction tabards or drop the highest iLevel gear. Even so, many level 85 players have politely requested that we add these normal dungeons back into their &quot;Specific Dungeons&quot; queue. Maybe they missed the opportunity to run the dungeons while leveling, or maybe they're having a hard time with the Heroic versions and would like some added practice. Either way, the request was sound and a relatively small change overall, so we were happy to implement it.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, just to reiterate, if you're level 85 and choose Random Dungeon, you will not be placed into a Throne of the Tides or Blackrock Caverns group. These normal dungeons can only be queued for by level 85 players using the &quot;Specific Dungeon&quot; list. So, if you'd prefer not to run either once you're max level, you definitely have that option. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/151315/normal-dungeons))<br />
<br />
Guild XP in 5-Man Instance changes in 4.0.6<br />
A group that has 4 guild members in it will earn 100% the normal rate; therefore, a group that has only 3 guild members in it will earn 50% -- or half -- of what the group of 4 earns. This is, of course, based on a five-man group.<br />
<br />
How will this work for raids? Will it still be @ an 80% threshold as it is now?<br />
Raids will continue to require 80% guild participation in order for guild experience and achievements to apply (excluding 40-man raids, which currently only require 40% guild participation). <br />
<br />
Sounds good to me, but doesn't this really cripple guildless players that rely solely on the LFD tool?<br />
Hm. I wouldn't think so, but it is something we'll be keeping an eye on. In fact, it's possible these changes may actually encourage guilds to use LFD more since the required number of guild members is being lowered from 4 to 3 (in order to be eligible for experience and achievements).<br />
<br />
In my guild, for example, we'll sometimes only have 10 members on at once. Of those 10 members, only 4 to 5 may be level 85. And of those level 85s, only 3 may want to run a Heroic dungeon. Right now, those 3 guild members may decide it's not worthwhile to organize a run and go on to do other activities -- but, if they had the added bonus of guild achievements and experience, it just might be the incentive they need to queue up through LFD. Similarly, by queuing up with only 3 guild members (instead of waiting for a 4th), that leaves 2 spots open for LFD, up from only 1. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/151347/the-guild-exp-change-from-the-patch-notes))<br />

4.0.6 Changes (Continued)<br />
Also, I think I muddled things a little bit when I was pointing out the DA buff. What I was trying to say (and poorly at the time) was that currently, Disc has a pretty strong Prayer of Healing because of DA and Inner Focus. Granted, it will be slightly less strong with the PoH change, but there is a Grace buff to 4.0.6 will make you better when healing multiple targets with normal heals as well. (No longer applies to just a single target.)<br />
<br />
We believe that Discipline is looking solid in the PTR, and again, would welcome those who want to test it and provide constructive feedback on it.<br />
<br />
As for the comment about having other healers around in Raids- Of course you'll have additional healing help for those big AoE damage fights. It's a Raid which has more players in it and thus more room for additional healers. I don't think any healer could expect to solo heal a Raid and be successful and if they can, then it's something we would have to look at.<br />
<br />
[...] We're keeping an eye on things and I'll be spending some time on the PTR as well (for what that's worth). I believe that Discipline won't be bad off once these changes are in and people have the appropriate gear and stats (don't forget to reforge, enchant, and gem). We'll keep watching for constructive feedback and keep working toward finding that sweet spot between difficulty and fun. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/150961/healer-nerfs))<br />

Seriouly, get a grib. No one cares if poly is star, moon or diamond!!! The one who marks just need to &quot;call the marks&quot; at the start of the run! (even though, the majority of the pugs i've been in have used: moon=poly, star=sap &amp; blue=trap).<br />

Moon = White = Priest<br />
Square = Light Blue = Mage<br />
Star = Yellow = Rogue<br />
Triangle = Green = Hunter<br />

Blizzard didn't pluck those colours of out their butts, they chose them because they are the class colours of the CC'ers when raid icons were released. Shamans (Blue), Paladins (Pink) and Warriors (Tan) didn't have viable CC methods so no icons were present. Cross (Red) was implemented as a secondary target as no class in Vanilla was Red.<br />

The Skull &amp; Cross are primary and secondary targets, red was chosen for the cross because no class, at the time, occupied the class colour of red. The other classes didn't have a viable CC when the raid icons were released which is why their colours aren't used.<br />

Great, you have a system that has no logical sense except that it's used by a lot of people. There's nothing wrong with that. However, complaining that the image is using a system that does make sense is a little shortsighted.<br />

Here's a hint: classes have colors associated with them.<br />

Also for as long as the marks have existed, blue square has always been a hunter's freezing trap.<br />

What the heck do traffic lights have to do with cc markings? There is no rule on what mark you use on what purpose. And also you do not cause an accident with other raidgroups by using different marks than them.</div></div><hr />

Except this isn't really true at all, no universal standard can be set because the number of CC outweighs the number of marks, especially when you start to include things like Reptenance, Sleep, and Seduce.<br />
<br />
It's extremely easy and not time-consuming at all, and my group breaks CC always in the order of least reliable --&gt; most reliable AND we call it out on vent while we do it. (Hey, Y Tank, grab Star while DPS finishes Moon.)<br />
<br />
Setting up a universal system and then trying to force it on others when it doesn't even work (more CC than marks) is just silly and unwanted.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Taking a lot of damage or your target is healing? -&gt;kite&quot;<br />

just no<br />
You pop a cooldown if you are taking a lot of damage. You don't run away.<br />
You only kite of the boss is slowed my a mechanic of the fight.<br />
If it's healing? what good does running away do?<br />

The brilliant thing about vent/raid/party chat is the leader can give extremely simple instructions and people can just STFU and follow them.<br />

If you're not a mage and the leader tells you to CC moon, if you're getting all bent out of shape about it you're bad and it's time to grow up. Maybe moon is keybound. Maybe your favorite mark isn't.

With that tone you really proved your &quot;pokemon&quot; attitude yourself :)<br />
<br />
Issue with picking a sign as most used, is that some might have it bounded, and as it's most used for that they don't have to reexplain on each group in a pug that &quot;mage, could you please cc the moon&quot; as it is more natural after one group to aknowledge that moon is for sheep. Makes things go smoother with less obsolete chatting around. <br />
<br />
Ofcourse idiots will always be idiots and not cc even if told and had a mark as big as the screen with writing on it &quot;sheep me sheep me&quot; but that's a different issue.<br />
<br />
So please, keep the tone to a &quot;fun&quot; one and give valid arguments without all the &quot;fucks&quot;. Ty.</div></div><hr />

You cannot per default match a color to a class, because there's more classes than colors, unless you count Skull and cross. Which we don't. Not to mention that some classes have 2 CC's.<br />

Not cool guys. The fan-art made me wish I had an Orc Warrior :P</div></div><hr />

No that doesn't mean I can't be banned. But what will you suckers do if your precious green mark, obviously belonging to the hunter ( I lol'd) is taken and so is your blue square by the mage? *I mean, helloooo, Moon has been mag = sheepe since end Vanilla, give our 5.5 years of marking experience a break please?<br />
You cannot per default match a color to a class, because there's more classes than colors, unless you count Skull and cross. Which we don't. Not to mention that some classes have 2 CC's.<br />
<br />
Whatever you do and really I don't care much, but Moon == Sheep. There is no debate.<br />
<br />
Actually, star has been sheep for a very long period on my old server, and this became moon only when realm transfers became more common. =) However, square in my experience has always been trap.<br />
<br />
I really fail to see why there's a discussion about marks really. People who are bad won't CC their target whether it's standardized or not. People who're good will CC whatever mark the target has. There are efficient macros to handle this very easily, without committing yourself to one single mark only.<br />
<br />
Moving on to a different topic, I love the art, but am confused about the bike. Maybe because I'm female. It's pretty and all but if I'd see that on the streets, nevermind that I play this game 10 hours a day and am a friggin' addict, I'd just facepalm. =D</div></div><hr />
