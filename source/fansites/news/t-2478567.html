Hey all, just wanted to make everybody aware that we made an update to the original post with the following information:<br />
<br />
We saw some confusion about a specific part of this post so we want to be clear that Customer Service will NOT be transferring items in WoW Classic and the system that we outlined will be in the players’ hands. If we were to go down the road of developing a policy on item trading, we believe it would end up allowing the exact same kind of abuse that we are trying to minimize with the 2-hour trade window system which we outlined in the original post.<br />
<br />
Ninja looting does have consequences in the community and those who do it will have trouble getting invited to group. In other words: your reputation will matter. Remember to play nice, play fair folks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
this beats some guy keeping the item then paging a GM to hand it to their friend. Ninjaing will happen far less than handing items under the table to a friend. Most people will reserve items and create the group around that.</div></div><hr />

I can't recall how often some jerk was blacklisted back in the day. I kept a spreadsheet back in the day of all the assholes I came across and would make comments next to them reminding me what they did. Every time I was in a raid and saw one of them, I'd let the raid leader know and they'd give them a swift kick. <br />
<br />
It's almost like people forget that vanilla was realm only, so if someone wants to be an asshole, they can afford the realm transfer when people start ignoring them.</div></div><hr />

What's wrong with that? Might not be ideal, but at least it's upfront. Would you rather it be reserved without your knowledge?<br />

It depended on realms I reckon for I can recall a pretty list of aholes on my server that NEVER got invites to anything, real fast after beign especially a ninja looter. That thing spreaded like wildfire back in the day. My guild in itself shared names of these amongst it members.</div></div><hr />

True.<br />
<br />
I do remember such incidents. Most guilds used to gkick ninja looters after being told about incidents and they were not invited to groups anymore, except for realm first guild that didn't care.<br />
<br />
But also there were entire realms made out of jerks, if I remember correctly in EU those were Al'Akir and Stormscale, though it was long time ago so I might be wrong about realms or it could have been during BC/WoTLK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is one perspective to look at it, however there's a also that perspective that the blue posted about. That's community will matter, who you are, what you do with other players will have consequences. It's not supposed to be progressive because 14 years ago the internet behaved very differently and without it, that aspect of the community, if it does not exist it will not be vanilla. Rather a very poor imitation, I think a lot of people who reminisces will remember that feeling and welcome it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Stormrage and stormreaver after it split off from stormrage It mattered. We had a few known ninja's that got blacklisted by the whole server and had to transfer off. A lot of us came from FFXI where it was even harsher with no server transfer or name change possible there to avoid the fallout.</div></div><hr />

It's almost like ... real life :o<br />
<br />
Be a thieving obnoxious brat at your workplace or anywhere else and it will have negative consequences. Be nice, helpful and behave yourself and it'll have positive consequences.<br />

This barely applies to WoW today ... but it certainly did during Vanilla and TBC. At least that was the case on my sever, which was a large one. Just ... play nice and your all good :)</div></div><hr />

idk on illidan in wrath people would ninja VOA boss 90% of the time, you had to make your own group or you would be screwed. The server was so populated, unless you were a popular well known player you had no reputation.<br />

Reserved loot =/= ninja looting. Reserving loot wasn't just accepted in Classic, it was the norm. Everyone that actually enjoys and wants to play Classic knows that.<br />
<br />
Again, this is a non-issue for the committed Classic crowd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention most specs have their own specific items they want to go for. If you reserve X, chances are that only a handful (at max) of other specs want it, compared to the 25%+ that would want a piece on live.<br />
<br />
My point being that reserving a piece will result in those specs likely not joining you, but you still have tons of others who will be unaffected. Plus I'd be more trusting of a group who DOES reserve loot over ones that don't because they're bring upfront with what they're taking instead of not saying anything. Why reserve something and then ninja later?</div></div><hr />

In vanilla I really did see more of this happen than people who deserved it getting bad reps, too. It varies by server doubtlessly but on mine this was the majority.

Actually, a player's reputation mattered a lot in Vanilla; there is a self-enforcing reason to behave reasonably. Stealing loot gives a player a bad name and no one likes to group with a thief.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Precisely. It’s a self policing system where once a few people claim you’re a bad seed; word will spread and person X can’t even say a word in general chat without being called out. <br />
<br />
People’s behavior matters in classic, and if you don’t care, you’ll be stuck doing low end activity or solo play</div></div><hr />

With loot trading ninjas could be punished? How do you imagine that? It anything, ninjaing would have become more common because everything could be traded, so people would click need without looking or for friends.<br />

It's hilarious that people think that someones &quot;reputation&quot; will be &quot;foiled&quot; after he'll be accused of ninja looting in /1 or something. Usually people just laugh at those who accuse people of such things, and no one actually bothers with making screenshots of chat where loot rules are described, so most of the time &quot;ninja&quot; can say that he reserved that piece of loot, and his guildies and friends will gladly back it up (since most likely the did reserved it before adding pugs in their raid). <br />
<br />
Even then, this guy just got his hands on a sweet piece of loot and became valuable character in late-vanilla, he won't be kicked from anywhere, in anything, depending on gear he may get poached because of that extra attention. Who would pass on a full-stocked tank warrior in late vanilla? Nobody. Even if he is a total asshole your guild will still have him around, because he makes a good training dummy for boss to hit and making a new one will take months.<br />
<br />
Anyways, people romanticizing this whole &quot;server reputation&quot; thing are going to have bad time when they'll realize that most players won't give a damn about them yelling &quot;ninja looter!&quot; at someone<br />

Sadly, ninja looters usually were guys in charge of things, so these &quot;guys don't invite him!&quot; didn't&quot; worked that well. You had an option to pass on raiding with him completely, and miss out of couple of raids (and would you really care about a rogue ninja if you play, say, a mage? or a priest? Not much, your gear is safe).<br />

We had couple of known ninjas on warsong on horde side, they were shunned, players spammed a lot of crap on them in global chat, but one of them was leading raids and his guild was one of the biggest, and second was a well geared tank.

Yes, that happened on many servers, however that was exception. Cutting edge guilds on most realms have always been full of assholes who think they are better than everyone else and are allowed to do anything. Such players will abuse anything, so if loot is allowed to be traded in groups, they'd be first to form small groups and need on items for friends. Assholes will always be assholes.<br />
<br />
Vast majority of players did care about reputation and were affected by their actions. Those top guild assholes were rare exception.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your amazing addition to the subject. Yes my whole point was based on the fact that in my opinion 13yo will be a tiny minority of the playerbase, and thus it would be bad to base policies on those minorities.<br />

nope mate - this was the general rule. <br />
<br />
if you were playing bis spec and semi good geared toon you could do anything you wanted - and nobody would do anything. <br />
<br />
because nobody sane would kick geared attuned player - the cost (regearing/reatturning new players) was simply way to care for anyone to do anything. <br />
<br />
people who never raidded vanilla and only played pirate servers have just distorted view of reality because they trully belive that just becaus little timmy was spaming trade about &quot;X is a ninja&quot; that anyone cared . <br />
<br />
i cannot count how many time i seen my char names in trade all the way from vanilla to mop and not even once i heared anything about it in guilds.<br />
<br />
and i was terrible to others back then - all those stories you may have heared about ninjas ? ye that was me because i was edgy teenager back then who cares about only myself. <br />
<br />
my masterpiece was for example making 10 man raids and then when something which i wanted dropped i started to kick from raid everybody who could potentialy roll need on it. - did they raid disband ? sure but who cares - there is always next reset and next alt to gear up this reset. you remember those raids with &quot;EVerything reserved &quot; ? ye that was me - and it worked. <br />
<br />
by your standards i should be shunned by whole servers - never heared anything besides angry whispers which i eagerly reported and it led to ban of few people who very pestering me from multiple alts :)<br />
<br />
people really live in delusional world</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't even start on a follow-up drama and chances, that one kicked &quot;ninja&quot; will end up being &quot;the guy&quot; (you know, &quot;he gave me gold when i needed&quot;, &quot;he helped me to attune my second char&quot;, &quot;he is in my honour farming group&quot;, that guy) for half of your guild, and they'll quit right after you kick him, are quite high.<br />

Such players will abuse anything, so if loot is allowed to be traded in groups, they'd be first to form small groups and need on items for friends. Assholes will always be assholes.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, you imply that cutting edge guilds, instead of farming raids together, will spread out and take a chance that they'll win rolls on anything, waste crapton of time doing pugs, AND loot master will turn a blind eye that a warrior just rolled on a spell power mace, and a minute later this spell power mace turned out to be in hands of a paladin from the same guild? That doesn't make any sense.<br />

I dont think this guy ever played vanilla... ninja looters were mostly NOT in charge of anything, the way ninjalooting happens in classic is when someone needs on something they shouldnt and dont actually need more than others. If you didnt know there were NO systems in place to prevent someone needing on an item they cant use... so people, who were not in charge of anything, were needing on items they only wanted to vendor for money or it was very trivial for them but still an upgrade, such selfishness can exist. (it happens all the way from deadmines up to anything at 60, but less likely at 60 since people didnt want a shitty reputation after spending so much time on the character already)<br />
<br />
I never saw BiS geared people ninjaing items in dungeons because frankly they didnt even do them anymore on those characters... and even if they did the same rules would have applied to them which is the need/greed-system and in that system it is possible to need on items you dont need.</div></div><hr />

I never saw BiS geared people ninjaing items in dungeons because frankly they didnt even do them anymore on those characters... and even if they did the same rules would have applied to them which is the need/greed-system and in that system it is possible to need on items you dont need.<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: whatever you want to call it, but ninjaing was always someone taking items without a roll, by swapping loot rule, or violating loot rules in the first place. Someone who rolls need on everything is easy to get rid of by, you know, not using this loot rule.<br />
<br />
You do realize how people get full BiS gear? If you are ready to actually form a pug and entitle yourself for some piece you miss for your full BiS you tell that upfront (or don't and get called a ninja when you take that perdition's blade and leave) unless you do it all proper with guildmates. Running pug raids with need or greed is ridiculous, you do that with people you know, not with strangers.</div></div><hr />

Ninjalooting is pretty much only a thing in 5 mans and badly organized raidpugs. How big of a problem is it really?<br />
<br />
True, if you ninjaloot my blue gear from BRD I'll be pissed, and I'll probably put you on my personal blacklist. Might throw out a comment in /1 that 99.9% of people will ignore. I'll tell you who probably won't ignore it though, my friends and possibly my guild.<br />
<br />
So sure, you get away with it a couple of times. It certainly won't be that nobody plays with you anymore. There will however be groups that exclude you. So a first time offense may not do much, but if you repeat thats an oil stain that spreads, and slowly eats way at your player experience.<br />
<br />
As a general rule, it's just not worth the hassle to ninja stuff =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stripped-Legion Classic client (at the lowest graphic) runs at 5 fps on my old notebook.<br />
On private servers real Classic client runs at 60 fps...<br />
<br />
Get the fock out of here!<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol are you serious ? Then play on private servers. We should use totally outdated technologies that don't impact the core game because... &quot;your pc sucks&quot; ? Just by a new one ffs, if wow is 5 fps on your laptop then it's not meant for gaming<br />

Not really, adding more &quot;DLC&quot; in the webshop is good for the business but not really for the whole game.<br />
More generally, it if was the case, capitalist societies would be perfect and we're far from it ;)</div></div><hr />

All it will do is punish people who don't know what they're doing. Your entire server will hate you and call you a ninja just because you didn't know any better, how are you supposed to learn from that? We need to be able to trade items we looted by mistake by opening tickets, anything else is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
It won't be an issue, since you'll have a two-hour trade window. As long as someone brings it up, you can be like, &quot;Oh, sorry. How does it work? I'm new, I don't really know what I'm doing.&quot; and things will be fine and dandy.</div></div><hr />

No we'll have a zero hour trade window and they won't respond to loot related tickets. The trading is only enabled in raids, if you make a mistake in a dungeon you'll be branded a ninja.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was referring to raids, not dungeons. If you do it in dungeons, it's less impactful, and people are more likely to be forgiving if you explain that it was a mistake. Especially if you're willing to offer gold in return, or offer to run the dungeon again and waive any other rewards to give them a second chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is the most true to actual Vanilla. The alternative is allow people to abuse the 2 hour trade option and multi-role on loot for their guildies.<br />
<br />
No loot trade in dungeons opens up a very small window for mistakes, while loot trading opens pandora's box for abuse.<br />
<br />
It generally takes several Ninja loots to get your brand on... so ethier a person's accidental need on something will be forgotten... or their multiple &quot;mistaken&quot; needs will root them out for what they are.<br />
<br />
Man the game sure has changed a lot... it went from if someone &quot;ninja's&quot; a piece of loot from a dungeon there is hell to pay, to being showered with so much loot no one cares.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for Classic!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarnaxxx</div><div class="date">2019-04-15, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then your server was crap. It did matter, I remember specifically avoiding known ninja looters. If you got called out in trade chat too many times, you were screwed. You were resigned to grouping with your guild, and if they had any sense they would kick you and you were double screwed. It rarely happened on purpose, the deterrent was real.<br />
<br />
I agree 100%. Your reputation was very important back in Vanilla and I believe if they stick to what they've said so far (Blizzard) -- it will matter once again!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seleri</div><div class="date">2019-04-15, 08:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Server reputation was such a thing in Classic that even almost 15 years later I still remember a dozen or so of the blacklisted people's names. Anyone that thinks griefers/ninjas/etc won't be branded and ostracized probably didn't actually play (or at least play seriously) in classic WoW. <br />
<br />
It wasn't people that accidentally hit need on something they didn't need though, I think most people misclicked at least once and it was understandable. These were people that deliberately screwed others over for their own gain and/or amusement.</div></div><hr />

Its open for abuse with guilds and yes similar tactics happened back in vanilla as well with no loot trade window. I'd rather the honest mistakes than something that can and will be abused by guilds who don't give a shit.</div></div><hr />
