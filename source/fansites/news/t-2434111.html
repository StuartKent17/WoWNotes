Blue Posts<br />
Rextroy Ban Reverted<br />
As a reminder, posting about account actions is generally not allowed on the forums and it is not a means to appeal or resolve issues. This was resolved privately between this player and us after the video he posted this morning.<br />
<br />
Just pulling back the curtain a little here but long story short, this was a mistake on our end. This player actually has a great history of reporting issues with us that they've found, and they wait for us to verify it's fixed before they put the videos up. This was a case of not everyone internally knowing this was happening and that the exploits he showcased were fixed, before the videos were posted. <br />
<br />
The videos being posted are an example of great bug reporting in how detailed they are in showing how exactly to reproduce an issue. This is something Ion hit on in the last Q&amp;A where he talked about the Quality Assurance team and how they have to reproduce issues that players report to us. Sometimes reports aren't detailed enough and it makes it a little harder to figure out some issues.<br />
<br />
I just want to end this by plugging the correct channels to report bugs in. <br />
<br />
To report a bug in-game:<br />
Click Help to open the Customer Support window.<br />
Click Submit Bug.<br />
Enter the details of the bug, making sure to follow the guidelines outlined on the submission form.<br />

Azerite Trait Tuning - September 25<br />
I've updated the OP here to better reflect what actually changed on Sharpened Blades:<br />
<br />
https://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
<br />
(Assassination) Sharpened Blades: The benefit of having multiple copies of this trait active is reduced. (Subtlety) Sharpened Blades: damage reduced by 30% (unchanged in PvP). The benefit of having multiple copies of this trait active is reduced.

Island Expedition Reward Sources<br />
A recent Reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9ipj6l/islands_are_the_best_content_system_released_in/) highlighted a theory that users such have been talking about on the forum for a while. <br />
<br />
The theory is that Island Expedition rewards are tied to killing specific named or types of NPCs on the island. For example, killing Mogu would give you a chance to win Pandaria transmog. Keep in mind that this is just a theory and isn't confirmed. <br />

Deadly Boss Mods Patreon<br />
MysticalOS has been working on Deadly Boss Mods (https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/deadly-boss-mods) full time for many years and recently posted an update (https://www.deadlybossmods.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=1135&amp;f=3) about having to step down from raiding and how it would impact the development of the addon. He had financial issues that were impacting his health, ability to raid, and life. The community stepped up to support him, and Blizzard and MSI sent some things (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9iw85z/blizzard_sent_me_surprise_a_today/) his way recently as well. <br />
<br />
If you'd like to support the project, you can do so through his Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/deadlybossmods) and the Donate link on the addon page (https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/deadly-boss-mods).<br />

Donation sent.<br />

This man/mod is a part of WoW to me and if you read about his situation and how many time he spends with developing he deserves a lot more than what he posted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He explains in his post that he has a really crappy PC that kinda stresses him out when he has to raid on 17fps. I think that's a really nice thing from blizzard to send him new gear so he can continue his work when his PC performance drastically increases.</div></div><hr />

With how many people are on his patreon he is far from being destitute. How about he switches it from number of donators to the dollar amount he is getting a month (this is a setting choice he made).<br />

<br />
The community needs Blizz to weigh in and address the fact that if you run expeditions in the fastest and 'most optimal' way, you'll never get any loot, making getting anything in a PUG an exercise in frustration. If I have to actively sandbag my team there's something wrong.</div></div><hr />

I think the fact that he's been doing it solo for 10 years without asking for help is what drove most people to donate. Everyone that has raided has used DBM at some point, it's an exceptional add-on.</div></div><hr />

Maybe instead of coming off as an insensitive prat, and bothered to read the link in this thread you will see that the author of DBM has a lot more on their plate, such as having to care for his 70 year old disabled mother among other things..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't donate then. The guy is the publisher of one of the most critical, and most used addons on World of Warcraft. He is not begging for handouts so much as saying that he won't be able to raid full time nor spend the time to work on his addon. I admire that people are helping him, if you disagree then do what you think is best. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I agree with this. considering his addon is inferior to other boss mods, he should perhaps get a job instead of feeling sorry for himself, and begging on the internet.<br />
<br />
There are people out there who can balance a life, and make addons aswell, and get donations from people who likes their productions, instead of having to have an advertised begging campaign going.<br />
<br />
Honestly this is the most modern-age behaviour from struggling people, we've seen on MMO-c the past year, and that says a lot.<br />

He said he needed a new pc and couldn't afford one, so blizz and msi helped him out. And he's got loads of mounting medical bills to pay for. <br />
<br />
And I don't know what country you live in but most economies are in the toilet, they certainly aren't 'netter than it's been for 20 years'. <br />
<br />
And, just so you know, most of us here are technically millenials. I'm 36 and I'm one. Even if I don't think I am.<br />

It's been a while since I got an infraction so I'll take this one for the team: go fuck yourself you total prick. <br />
<br />
And for the record: before he made his post he had around 800 patreons, it's obviously shot up since people have, quite rightly, been donating money to him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of people are struggling. They don't beg on the internet for handouts.<br />
<br />
Did you bother to think that before all this he didn't have that many people on Patreon to support to begin with?<br />
Did you bother to think that he might have a lot more expenses than what e.g. you have due to his circumstances?<br />
<br />
Also, why are you complaining? People donate / become a Patreon because they support the work he does, as well as help him out in his needs. Nobody is forcing anyone to do anything.<br />

I use DBM, a lot of other people uses DBM. It's not a contest on &quot;Which addon is the best?&quot;. If there's a significant userbase for your addon then you will keep developing it, regardless if it is the #1 addon out there or not. What a illogical way of thinking from your side there.<br />
<br />
Sure, he could go and get a job, and most likely that would've happened, but then the addon would be suffering considering the circumstances he is in. Instead, he has give the community a choice to aid him if they want to. Nobody is being forced.<br />
Apparently, he has big enough community backing him that he can (hopefully) get enough finance to continue instead.<br />
<br />
Furthermore: He didn't have that many Patreons before his open letter regarding his situation. People are become a Patreon on their own volition.<br />
<br />

Go fuck yourselves whiners, let the guy make a fucking living in peace. Good for him his income has spiked 650% in the past week, and good on Blizzard and MSI for gifting him a new rig.<br />

Do you have literal brain damage or something?<br />
How elese would you come up with this backwards bullcrap.<br />
<br />
He is not refusing to work. He wants to work and be supported for the work he does creating DBM. That IS work. The issue is, he can't directly sell the addon, so he needs a Patreon. If he instead of working on DBM worked a normal job, then there would be no DBM you moron.<br />
He never begged. He only said, he will be slowing down DBM to focus on a normal job, so that he can pay for his medical bills. He explained WHY he needs to focus on his actual job. Never asked for money. People gave him money themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if he wanted to work then why hasnt he? Twp years with an abscessed tooth? I had one abcess and the pain was so bad left work and went to a cash dentist 45 minutes away to get it pulled. It cost me 100$ or slightly less. And you could make 100$ of small website gig.<br />
<br />
I feel for the guy. I really do. It's shitty. I take care of my mom too. She's got thyroid dysfunction and congestive heart failure. She does pretty good but can't work a real job. So I make sure the house bills are paid and she has enough money to sell her crafts online. She makes enough form that to pay for her meds and cigarettes cuz I told her I wasn't buying her tobacco considering she's basically killing herself with it.<br />
<br />
I also have a not potato pc I built and do side gigs to pay for extra shit when I need it. So it's just a matter of how you handle shit life has dealt you.<br />
<br />
Now yeah dBm is excellent and it's been hard work. He deserves every dollar someone wants to send his way for gifting us with dBm for a decade or so now.</div></div><hr />

I was in a similar situation for over eight years. The balancing is rough and the mental toll it takes is even harsher. I'm glad to see there are some community folks still willing to help someone out in need that's given quite a bit back to players over the years.</div></div><hr />

I did it for 8 months, with a dying parent. It consumed my life, I can't imagine 8 years. You have my deepest respect. <br />
<br />
If you actually read everything he wrote, he was going out of his way for years to not beg for money, and do what he loves to do, to the point of putting his own health at risk. And in true fashion, the greediest of greedy players can only spew bile because someone got something they didn't. They're not even worthy of the energy needed to have contempt and loathing for them.</div></div><hr />

When Adam posted his original post (and when I read it) his patreon count was below 600. I'm sure that his original post was sincere in the fact that he hardly made enough money to support himself and his mother. He didn't even have enough money to go to a dentist, what's up with that.<br />
<br />
I am glad the community jumped on this to help the guy. He deserves to live a decent life.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Triggered Fridgekin</div><div class="date">2018-09-26, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Pretty late to the party on MysticalOS but great exposure for him nonetheless. Even if he sees a massive drop of patrons next month it should be more than enough to at least have his most dire needs seen to such as his dental concerns. Hell, Blizzard and MSI dropped a new desktop and extra swag on his lap which I would say is very well deserved given how integral his mod is in the community. <br />
<br />
As for doing home care... it's hard. Like really hard. Like you have to put everything aside at the drop of a hat if something goes wrong kind of hard and with older people it's a lot. My mom and her bf do it for my grand parents and in one example they had to burn at least a dozen work days off in a month not long ago because my grand father is diabetic and his sugars went out of whack, gets gout all the time, along with pneumonia as well as my grand mother who has hip and breathing problems. Doctor's appointments, out-patience, picking up pills, paying bills etc all add up too especially the first two when dealing with the elderly. Grand father feels dizzy at 2am? Go to out-patience till morning. Grand mother needs to see the specialist? Get ready for a three hour drive to Halifax.<br />
<br />
The worst part is is now that they're settled in to home care any mention of a retirement home is met with immediate emotional push back from them. They fail to see the larger picture that if things get worse which they undoubtedly will since my grand father is starting with dementia (among other things) then that puts an enormous burden on my parents and even myself since I have to more or less be &quot;on call&quot; when my parents aren't available which is often now since they both work in the school system. They are quick to dismiss our efforts to keep them comfortable in spite of the fact that we built on a fully-furnished apartment attached to my parents' home to serve as a temporary solution until it falls outside of our control.<br />
<br />
It's not for everyone and I don't blame those who would rather not take on that burden. It can cripple your finances, you're always stressed out and you're not able to make plans for anything since your life more or less revolves around whether or not they are feeling okay which can change at any time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me try to use simple words, for a simple mind like yours:<br />
Stop your jealousy. It's cringe worthy. People can do with their money, whatever people want to do with their money. You are still able to download the addon for free, right? Not a single aspect of your life is being affected by this.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm really glad he is making money out of this, and I also really hope he keeps the support coming up for a long time.<br />
<br />
I love the addon and I love the fact he is now getting a tangible motivation to make it better. If he can make a living out of it, well, good for him. Creating a business works differently for different people.</div></div><hr />

Thanks and I have respect for anyone that chooses to take on the role of caregiver for their parents, considering how hard it hits. <br />
<br />
As for the rest I did read it, and the other posts he's made. I've known a few people like him that never wanted to ask for help cause it felt wrong, just because of their upbringing or beliefs. I'm just glad he was able to, and that he's going to be able to get the help he needs (dental work) while still being able to care for his mother and have at least a small bit of financial respite.</div></div><hr />

With how many people are on his patreon he is far from being destitute. How about he switches it from number of donators to the dollar amount he is getting a month (this is a setting choice he made).<br />
<br />
A lot of people are struggling. They don't beg on the internet for handouts.<br />

Well not true boy, I've changed myself ages to BigWigs, they are more accurate. Nevertheless the poor guy living properly in the rich USA, in a country without any insurance, the message here is more, think, think again, and think again about THIS SITUATION WILL NOT HAPPEN TO YOU. <br />
<br />
Is doesn't matter the poor guy got some donations or not, he will fail again. In other words, check healthcare package, it is better invest into yourself, into your family, than every year new mobile or other bullshit. In all this years, I've met in-game a lot of people. The difference today is only, who has the better addons. wins blizz, no ad-dons, no such problems :) As a hint, checkout the PvP player, they are Gods, if they need to play at a Blizz events, they are noobs like :) <br />
<br />
In-game, I've just left a guild which leader was in a good position and he had a accident, (also no insurance and no family) lost everything, month middle you're supposed to send him little cash, some donate food. Or they have donated to buy him a new computer .... Sweet too, but it is also not helping. In real live he is lazy and useless, fortunately he lives in a social environment as a parasite for the global community. In-game he found some way to survive, use people. <br />
<br />
With a bigger view, Blizz was wrongdoing, it only generates more jealousy as we already have. Of course it is tragic but there are other addons too, if Blizzard would help, they should fight for a better healthcare/prevention system (starting internal:) but this is properly too anti-american, happy November voting :)</div></div><hr />

However, when reading quotes like this:<br />
<br />
&quot;I have no life, no friends, no time to really do anything else at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;You cannot understand the amount of hours and commitment, all while barely making 1300 (most months)-1450(early expansion) a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Gives me the impression that the situation he's in is mostly on himself. It's not like he suddenly plummeted into a bad situation. That was a series of bad decision making in life over yeeears. If raiding and developing an addon for a fucking videogame that leaves you with almost no income is more important than your personal life, health, family, friends and career then there must be something really wrong with you. At some point in life you simply have to grow the fuck up and set your priorities straight. Imagine he only freed up some time of his time spent on DBM/WoW he could work a full-time job with steady income or develop something that makes profit.<br />
<br />
The raiding scene would easily survive without him. Somebody else would step up and make something similar to DBM. In fact, there already is with BigWigs and WeakAuras that can do the same equally good or even better.<br />
<br />
I really do hope that he learned his lesson and starts to focus on the actually important things in life.</div></div><hr />

What a joke, DBM was not the first boss mod and DBM only came into being because of repeated plagiarism. If you like bloated mods that try to do too much then it is just what you want, but there are other boss mods that work just as well if not better. The only reason it has the popularity it does it because people are sheep.<br />
<br />
The fact that they have to design raid encounters around boss mods is not a positive in the least. It just makes for lazy encounters and raiders.</div></div><hr />
