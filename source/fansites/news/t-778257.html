Blizzcon 2010 starts tomorrow! As usual you can expect a full coverage on MMO-Champion, including a live blog this year (if everything works as planned!). Apparently blue posters will be more active during the convention and you can probably expect a couple of exciting updates in the next few days!

BlizzCon 2010: Blues Among You<br />
For the past few years, you may have noticed Community Team members moderating the various BlizzCon panels. This year, things are a little bit different. Instead of moderating panels, we’ll be providing BlizzCon updates on the forums, Facebook, and Twitter as well as mingling with attendees around the convention center. That’s right, this year we will be among you and look forward to getting meet and talk with you during the convention. If you see one of us, feel free to stop us and say, “Hi”. <br />

AQ Scepter Quest Line Feat of Strength<br />
We don't feel just completing this quest line should give you something permanently unique. The feat of strength is a nod to this epic quest line and for those who worked all the way through it. It isn't as awesome as a title or a legendary and it isn't meant to be.<br />
<br />
Also, I guess I'm just a little weird as I often compare feats of strength as I feel those matter more than achievements. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25969039696/aq-scepter-quest-cata-change-big-update/))<br />

Talent trees too easy?<br />
I'm not convinced these posts aren't exaggerations popping out in the wake of major change. I've tried choosing specializations for several different classes and had tough, but fun choices to make in every case. There are at least a few talents in each tree which will provide extra flavor or utility according to your play style.<br />
<br />
Will people determine the best min/max builds and spread them to the masses? Sure. That happened before patch 4.0.1 anyway. Prior to 4.0.1 you sure did have more talents and more points to spend, but the illusion of choice isn't the same thing as true choice. So many of the choices you had were between rather boring passive talents, and the choice was usually very clear. You usually chose the obvious power-increasing talents to improve your performance. Now your choices are a little more flavorful, and the best route to take is a little more subjective. You also have a greater choice of utility and power in your glyphs, and on your gear via Reforging.<br />
<br />
Try taking another look at your old talent trees and let me know if there were truly a lot of very compelling talents that made choosing really hard, or if there were just a bunch more branches to throw points in. Look at the trees today and let me know if there are truly no choices for you to make that might enhance the enjoyment of playing your class.

Low Level Class Balance<br />
We are going to spend some effort adjusting numbers for 1-80. It's not as big a priority as 85 because frankly, more players care about balance at 85 than they do lower level balance. As some folks have pointed out, inexperienced players almost by definition, don't place a premium on balance, and experienced players tend to not worry about balance much until they're at max level since things are changing so quickly.<br />
<br />
Rather than adjusting everything independently, we tend to focus on max level and then work backwards from there. It doesn't help to nerf say rogue damage by 5% from level 1-60 if we then find we also need to nerf it at level 85 and then buff the 1-60 numbers to compensate.<br />
<br />
There is some goofy stuff going on at lower level, but we'll get it all straightened out. After spending so much effort revamping the old zones and quests, we don't want the leveling experience to be an odd one.

Do not think so. Blizzard started &quot;raids for casuals&quot; politics in LK and probably we will see a lot of easy encounters in Cata. Normal mode for casuals, hard mode for raider. Everyone is happy.. Except hardcore raiders :)</div></div><hr />

Now I know that all tanks are melee, but they aren't melee DPS. :P Besides, some other tank gear actually got flagged as tank gear. So is it perhaps possible that tank gear gets labeled as &quot;Tank&quot; in the future? :)<br />
<br />
PS.<br />
I see a lot of gear with really simple stats. For example &quot;Stamina, Strength, Expertise and Mastery&quot;. I wonder if there are going to be big fights among melee DPS and Tanks now. Before it simply was &quot;if it has defense it's a tank item, if it doesn't, it isn't&quot;. But above example could potentially be really nice as a tank gear. Hit and Expertise are always needed for tanking, and Mastery is basically needed by all classes. Reforge some excess Expertise or Mastery into Parry or Dodge if you even need any more of that at all, and it's golden. But even without Parry or Dodge it's nice. XD<br />

You can still show Feats of Strengths. If it's only to show off, a FOS is exactly nice for that. Pets and mounts shouldn't be for bragging or showing off, but for having something that looks nice, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

That’s right, this year we will be among you and look forward to getting meet and talk with you during the convention. If you see one of us, feel free to stop us and say, “Hi”.<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler is not a part of the Community Team. The Community Team includes people like Bashiok, Nethaera, Bornakk, etc. GC will likely be on some of the panels and fielding Q&amp;A though.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone know if we'll be able to watch all of it, streamed from the BlizzCon player, on sunday? Like, as if it were live, except it's just not?<br />
<br />
I'm afraid you can't, seeing as it's a live stream. They may have changed it without really announcing but last year there was no such option. Times are still pretty decent tho, 20-24 is doable for most ppl without staying up past their bedtime and the ones after that will require a bit of extra effort :).</div></div><hr />

People should not be posting these types of comments. Live means as it's happening. If any of you did not know this then yes, you have wasted your money due to lack of knowledge. If you see anything which says &quot;Live&quot; and you want to know what time in your area that would be simply find out what time zone the &quot;Live&quot; broadcast is in and find a converter to show what time it would be where you live. Also for &quot;like, as if it were live, except it's just not?&quot; I'm sure there will be plenty of videos online available afterwards for those who don't get to watch it live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've always been a little disappointed by dragon bosses, but this looks like it should with all that fire and general carnage going on. Fire breathing dragons should F stuff up :)<br />

What's up with the Paladin healing in the &quot;Paragon vs Atramedes&quot; video. He's at full mana about the whole damn video. Is it going to be that easy, really? Thought they did a lot of reworking on the mana issue for cata, seems as it didn't work out extremely well?<br />
<br />
There is a GM there, so maybe they had help, beta isn't final and Paragon aren't really a good example of a normal guild. They probably outgear the instance already and have all the best buffs/syncs, even on beta. Also it's an opening raid so it isn't going to be that hard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Therec</div><div class="date">2010-10-21, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Atramedes looks amazing. If Paragon is having half their raid die to the normal version of the fight, I can't imagine how hard it will be for the heroic version. I've been very pleased with most of these new boss fights. IMO it's always more satisfying to take down a boss with a lot of mechanics to deal with (i.e. Sindragosa and Putricide HM) than it is just facerolling a tank and spank boss like Saurfang HM.</div></div><hr />

You had to have purchased the live stream in order to view it, however. I don't see any reason for them to remove this feature</div></div><hr />

The goblin &quot;fanart&quot; is 100% stolen from existing Bliz art. Search for &quot;wow goblin&quot; in google and see for yourself. Plagiarism sucks.</div></div><hr />

Okay. I look at the trees today and and there are no choices for me to make that might enhance the enjoyment of playing my class and the fact that you force me to put 31 points into the same tree doesn't help either.<br />
<br />
GC needs to get a clue, half the classes I spec'd had no choices. It was back filling crap talents just so I could progress up the tree.</div></div><hr />

Sure, I understand the concept of &quot;live&quot;, I'm not an idiot. Why I asked this questions is basically, when watching the blizzcon testing videos that are up right now, you can choose to watch live and choose to &quot;go back in time&quot;, if you understand what I mean. I was just wondering if this is a possibility to do the entire weekend, or just during airing hours. About lacking of knowledge; I couldn't find the time zone info anywhere on the current blizzcon page. All it said was &quot;11 am&quot;, which could just as well have been 11 am in Britian/France/Whatever.<br />
<br />
So, back to my question, how was it last year? Could you catch up the stuff that you missed, during the weekend?</div></div><hr />
