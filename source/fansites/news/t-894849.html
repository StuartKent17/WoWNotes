For ages, the Elemental Plane served its purpose as a secure realm to imprison Azeroth's primordial spirits... until the Cataclysm ruptured its boundaries. Without warning, Ragnaros's armies surged toward Mount Hyjal, intent on burning the World Tree of Nordrassil to the ground. In the ensuing conflict, many brave heroes gave their lives to protect Hyjal from destruction. By their noble sacrifices, the impossible was achieved: the Guardians of Hyjal pushed Ragnaros's minions back into the Firelands.<br />
<br />
Now, the battle to protect Hyjal rages in Ragnaros's smoldering realm. As territory is gained and Azeroth's champions edge closer to the Firelands' inner sanctums, a monumental task lies ahead. Entrenched around Ragnaros's lair -- Sulfuron Keep -- are his most trusted guardians, including the turncoat Druids of the Flame and their mysterious leader. Yet Hyjal's defenders cannot afford to shy away from any of these dangers. Should Ragnaros prevail against the incursion and succeed in destroying Nordrassil, Azeroth will suffer a blow from which it might never recover.<br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft patch 4.2 will offer hardy adventurers an opportunity to turn the tide in the Firelands, a huge outdoor raid of the highest difficulty, with 10-person and 25-person normal and Heroic modes. It will be a scorching opportunity to delve into this Elemental Plane, where six unique bosses stand between you and the reinvigorated Ragnaros. The great fire lord's chamber is shielded by:<br />
<br />
Beth'tilac<br />
<br />
Her fiery webs reach far overhead, daring her adversaries to simultaneously face their fears of both spiders and heights. Only by taking hold of her webs and climbing into her domain yourself will you find a way to thwart her evil designs.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Lord Rhyolith<br />
<br />
Heroes face a difficult challenge: attack this massive magma giant's bulk while forcing him to move against his will among volcanic eruptions that ultimately spell his doom... or yours.<br />
<br />
Alysrazor<br />
<br />
Are you ready to fly the fiery skies? Catch her singed feathers and use them to soar above the inferno, or perish at the whim of this swift firehawk.<br />
<br />

<br />
Shannox<br />
<br />
The ferocious flamewakers of this Elemental Plane are terrifying enough, but Shannox has brought companions to his side in defense of the Firelands. This mighty hunter will require that you find a way to deal with his blazing pets before he burns you to a crisp.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Baleroc<br />
<br />
Baleroc stands before the gate to Sulfuron Keep, amidst a river of combustion that serves as the Sulfuron moat. The bridge to Ragnaros’s blistering chamber can only be crossed by those who find a way to put an end to this towering elemental monstrosity.<br />
<br />
Majordomo Staghelm<br />
<br />
Ragnaros's latest chief lieutenant stands before the door to his master's chamber in Sulfuron Keep. Majordomo Staghelm's treasonous efforts will all come to a head before the very seat of his new master.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/RT5N2O509C7U1303754464240_small2.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/RT5N2O509C7U1303754464240.jpg)<br />
<br />
Defeat his guardians and a memorable battle with the enraged Ragnaros awaits you in his chamber. Ragnaros's normal and Heroic modes offer two completely different encounters for raiders to conquer.<br />
<br />
Because the Firelands raid is outdoors, players will be able to mount and attempt to avoid the highly dangerous groups of enemies milling about. The order in which you engage the first four bosses in the zone will be up to you.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This will also be one stop of many in a quest to build the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa’s Rest. A weapon of unsurpassed quality, Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa’s Rest will not only require a spectacular effort by its owner to construct; it will reward the entire guild with a new and unique non-combat pet upon completion.<br />
<br />
A tantalizing collection of unique rewards await those who brave the heat, and defeat the lords of the Firelands. With a new raid tier of armor and weapons, three new mounts (including the rare and highly sought flaming Anzu), a slew of new personal and guild achievements, an epic storyline, a grand musical score, and seven unique boss encounters, 4.2 and the Firelands raid will burn an indelible mark in World of Warcraft history.<br />
<br />
Are you prepared to taste the flames?<br />

But yeah, it's true that having another raid along with it with a very different theme would be a good thing - and the very reason they wanted several raids each tier.</div></div><hr />

Well, to be fair, there was only ICC that was ice based. Even then, how much of the ICC bosses were actually frost based? Sindragosa/Arthas? I think the design was awesome :P</div></div><hr />

If it is true that this is the only content in 4.2, it's more than likely due to the fact that Summer content always gets the short end of the stick and Blizzard realizes this. So, they'll put out just enough to keep the masses intrigued without releasing so much that it's deemed overwhelming for this time of the year. Ulduar would have been an even larger success had it been released in November, imo.</div></div><hr />

Ulduar would have been an even larger success had it been released in November, imo.<br />
Might be true but I must say, 7 bosses in 4.2 seems a bit low. On a different note: I can't wait to see it released :o.</div></div><hr />

The color palette for this place is bleh too. Look at it. Nothing but red, orange, black, and then more red, orange, and black on top of that... with spikes. They've effectively turned Ragnaros into a Marvel supervillian and Firelands into his secret hideout.<br />

the open world feal is great for the first 4 bosses wish they would do it more often. I like the non liner feal of dungeons as much as we including me crapped on VOA it was the most open world dungeon ever you could choose which bosses you wanted to fight at any time. <br />

from post<br />
Heroes face a difficult challenge: attack this massive magma giant's bulk while forcing him to move against his will among volcanic eruptions that ultimately spell his doom... or yours.<br />
<br />
and Baleroc being the dps check for the final 2 bosses. <br />
An idea i really like the dps check not coming early so it seems that the first four bosses might be pugged after a few weeks the only brick wall being the last three.<br />
<br />
All in all it seems like i have plenty to wonder about it will be a fun raid that is for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ragnaros is working for deathwing....so is al'akir....this is why we are fighting the 2 of them. they want to tear shit up on azeroth so they can rule it again. they think that working for deathwing will accomplish that. therazane and neptulon are on our side (for the time being)<br />
<br />
deathwing is more or less pulling all the strings here (except for his old god master). if you cant see that by now you either dont pay attention to the quests or just dont care. this expansion is not exclusive to deathwing in its theme....it is heavily elemental based so i dont see how this isnt relevant to the story.<br />
<br />
OT: i am very excited about this. everything looks amazing but like people are saying i hope they do add at least a little something more as far as raid bosses go. if not, oh well....firelands looks like it will keep people busy for a while</div></div><hr />

The time frame for the release of Firelands will likely be similar to what was with Ulduar, and Ulduar had double the content. (Not to mention that Ulduar was alot more appealing concept-wise than &quot;lol big bad fireguys&quot;, but I guess thats just me.)<br />

The color palette for this place is bleh too. Look at it. Nothing but red, orange, black, and then more red, orange, and black on top of that... with spikes. They've effectively turned Ragnaros into a Marvel supervillian and Firelands into his secret hideout.<br />

The encounters do look like they'll be nice. I really hope that they'll be better tuned for each raid size tho.

You do realize that fire is nothing but a chemical reaction, upon which its color is determined by the compounds that are burning, right? For example, when you burn potassium, the flame is purple. Yes... purple fire. (Sodium will give you a bright yellow color; copper, depending on the specific compound, can result in either a blue or green flame; etc, etc.)<br />

Yes, let's apply modern science to a fantasy game where you can ride a constellation horse, genocide is accepted, alchemy still exists and Thorium isn't a radioactive material and is mined in large quantities. Let's throw all the previous artwork about the Firelands and Ragnaros, who have been depicted as flaming red since the game's creation, out the window and start making everything purple and blue because those shades of fire exist and one guy thinks it would look so much cooler.<br />
<br />
Making comparisons to places like Vashj'ir is ridiculous because they're fundamentally separate. Vashj'ir is an oceanic zone, meaning it better have lush water foliage, pretty colorful fish and reefs and multiple shades of blue, or they did it wrong. The Firelands is a barren wasteland of magma, flaming earth, lava and fire and if it weren't colored appropriately, it would be wrong. The Firelands has been, is and will continue to be red, deal with it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, because educating some idiot that thinks the only kind of fire is the red kind is the same as wanting to inject the rules of reality into a fictional setting. It makes perfect sense! :rolleyes:<br />

I don't understand the fuss. If the content is challenging enough, we don't need 12 bosses in there.<br />
<br />
True i na sense. But TBC was about killing Illidan and stopping Archimonde. After that was done the x-pac in many peoples eyes was done. Sunwell was seen as more of a filler until wrath launch.<br />
Very few guilds defeated Sunwell, and only about 5% of raiding guilds managed to clear it even after the 30% nerf. About 90% of the player base never got to see anything in sunwell save for trash farming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sunwell was gated like hell with the unlocks back then, and lets not forget the guildkiller pre KJ which is known as Muru.<br />
And even that one lasted about a week?<br />
6 bosses without unlocks will result in a firstweek clear, and while you can debate if thats good or bad that wont change the fact that it will happen unless something is either bugged or overtuned to prevent that from happening.</div></div><hr />

It isn't great but it gets the job done. If 4.2 stays the way it is with only 7 bosses... welcome to ToC all over again. As it is Im not impressed with Firelands. The majority of the raid (everything except Sulfuron Keep) looks like copy + pasted Searing Gorge. So lets examine Blizzard's body of work since Ulduar (When Greg &quot;Ghostcrawler&quot; Street took over as lead designer)<br />
<br />
ToC - Terrible terrible raid instance<br />
Icecrown Citadel - A good raid instance, but 1 year of that place was waaay too long to raid one instance.<br />
Tier 11 - I think of this tier and feel very &quot;meh&quot; about it. Good for intro Cata raiding, but nothing special.<br />
Firelands - Slated to have only 7 bosses. One raid night per week. Tier 12 definitely needs about 4-5 more bosses.<br />
<br />
I seriously wonder if Blizzard is sitting on its mountain of money and becoming complacent and lazy. With the money and status they have achieved maybe they are finding it more cost effective to put out bland content than to create the interesting and amazing content that got them where they are.</div></div><hr />

Sunwell had 6 bosses and was, arguably, the best raid ever made. ToC only had 5, and Firelands has 7. 7 &gt; 5.</div></div><hr />

Greg Street is Lead SYSTEMS Designer, there is no such thing as Lead Designer. Other people are Lead Art Designer, Lead Interface Designer, Lead Encounter Designer etc...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over-inflated sense of entitlement much?<br />
<br />
What is the point of adding bosses, if you don't mind me asking? If they added bosses, would that actually make you feel better, or would you complain about them recycling encounter mechanics to provide more boss encounters (and I would submit that, perhaps, you are simply looking for expanded loot tables vs. more game time spent in raid)?<br />
<br />
Do the forum a favor and quantify what it is you want - and no, more bosses doesn't cut it. What specific game mechanics excite you? Are you looking for a more dynamic world (I hate bringing up Rift, but many folks champion the &quot;dynamic even&quot; style that it offers)? If so, what about the new quest hub design isn't cutting it for you? Does the loot system need an overhaul? If so, how would you suggest it change?<br />
<br />
If your main interest lies exclusively in end-game content, then you are probably right. . . 7 bosses won't be enough for you. I would submit that it isn't Mr. Street's fault - it's you. If you're able to embrace the entirety of the content available, it might change your opinion of the hard work they have put into this (which probably started, to be honest, back when ToC was released).<br />
<br />
On that note, the toughest part for many is waiting for changes to come to light. It's unrealistic for us as a player-base to demand immediate change to satisfy our discontent with current gameplay. Did you look at their content release schedule? It isn't projected based on a weekly standard - you're dealing with years of planning. That isn't lazy - it's smart business, and complacency doesn't even begin to factor into the equation. They are juggling player perceptions and requests, competition with newly released games, budget restraints, employee satisfaction (yes, they are allowed to go on vacations - I know it puts a damper on your ideal release schedule, but give them a break), subscriber morale, and hotfixing/balancing current content to allow for enhanced game experience for a majority of their enormous player-base.<br />
<br />
You try it.</div></div><hr />

Well, unless he still has them of course, but they're below the platform... But at least we won't be forced to see them, I hope.<br />
<br />
I think we will see them in a certain phase of the combat :(</div></div><hr />
