You think I'm joking but here's how a typical AoE pull goes with Hati around. The AI is so borked. https://t.co/laLS7GFfyl<br />
.Hunters and Gloria - what do you, ideally, in any situation, want Hati to do? It can't be auto-win in raid fights. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/812514324627365888))<br />
I wish Hati was more responsive. My main pet is always on target while Hati is left in the dust.<br />
This seems solvable, will discuss. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/812523306863575040))<br />
nobody's asking for autowin. We just want class coders to fix what was reported broken a year ago<br />
.This has been bugged, pathfinding is a hard problem to solve, worse with 2 pets. It needs to be solved though. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/812522943959834625))<br />
<br />
I'm still surprised that NONE of the new pet families had family abilities at launch.<br />
Valid, the replacements for passives weren't added after they were removed, working on this atm, thx. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/812524082608541696))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Is it possible that no dev actual play’s a class? There are a lot of rumors that since Xelnath left that there are none for warlocks. Would explain the stated they are in right now. And if so, would it so hard for blizzard (a billion dollar company) to hire a dedicated single dev per class and to let them talk to the community?<br />
I think you’re talking about 4 different things here:<br />
<br />
<br />
Does a developer need to hire someone who focuses on playing X class?<br />
Does a developer need to hire someone who works on X class?<br />
Does a developer need to hire someone to read feedback on X class?<br />
Does a developer need to hire someone to reply to feedback on X class?<br />
<br />
<br />
When I was at Blizzard, we had points 2 and 3 solidly covered. I assume that is still the case today. Point 4 is more about company communication policy. <br />
<br />
Point 1 I think is an interesting debate. Let’s say that WoW eventually has 20 classes. Do you need 20 class designers in that world? What if one designer is better at her class than another? What if one mostly plays PvP and another PvE? What if their guild asks them to play an alt for their raid? Are they now supposed to resign their class design position? What if Doom comes out and they really want to play Doom for a few weeks? Does that mean their class design suffers? League of Legends by contrast has over 130 champions. Should we hire that many designers? Should we give each designer 6 champions?<br />
<br />
The point I am trying to raise with all of these theoretical questions is maybe point 1 isn’t that important if point 2 and 3 are covered. Yes, you need enough knowledge to be able not only to troubleshoot but also to empathize with players. <br />
<br />
I’m just dragging this out, because it is a question I have gotten a lot about game design - specifically do you need to play X to be able to work on X. A lot of people work on rockets who don’t actually go into space, but they certainly need to understand what going into space entails.<br />
<br />
But I’d be interested in understanding *why* so many players think that it’s important that you main X in order to make sure they are designed well. (Source (http://askghostcrawler.tumblr.com/post/154386461983/is-it-possible-that-no-dev-actual-plays-a-class))<br />

For GC, I feel the the importance is dev's should feel like they have some kind of dog in the fight. Take for instance how many played frost mages and that made the PvP scene to nerf them so much more difficult. If you have them pushing back on one but no one to defend another -- is that truly fair and balance? Does that REALLY take 2 and 3 into account? Yeah, sure they can work on it. Yeah, sure they can read on it. Do they REALLY care?<br />
<br />
It's easier to defend your class when it's YOUR class. It's less easier when it's not. I find it disappointing he's unaware of this.<br />
<br />
So if a dev has a &quot;dog in the fight&quot; then there's reason for them to be against or for changes. If not then history does tend to show significant bias (e.g. frost mages).</div></div><hr />

what do you, ideally, in any situation, want Hati to do? It can't be auto-win in raid fights.<br />

How about looking at the situation. The Main pet is attacking while Hati the second pet is just sitting there on his butt swiping at the air. Nothing wrong here mates. Then they just jump to the natural conclusion that if Hati works correctly its an &quot;auto-win&quot; for Hunters and we cant have that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
California has nothing to do with anything, don't be silly.<br />
<br />
And, I don't think he's talking about what's happening right now specifically, he's rambling in a theoretical sense. The devs seem to love to navel gaze like that - when they confront a problem, they start the &quot;Why is that?&quot; rabbit hole, and the problem lingers, while they jump down the rabbit hole of design aesthetics. So calling him a liar is pretty stupid, in this context, you really should calm down. He's talking about game design in theory, not what's happening in Irvine right now. And that's a big part of the problem, they spend more time on theory than they do actual fixes, or just trying something different.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the Blizzard specific problem right now is Celestalon and his team. You need to be angry at him, not Ghostcrawler. They bit off WAY more than they could chew redesigning every class like this, when they should have done it in phases, and just put up with the bitching and moaning from the classes that didn;'t make the cut. That they're still redesigning the classes, and don't know how they should work this far into the expansion tells you all you need to know - they're too slow, there's something broken in their design process, ideas and changes are being signed off on without looking at their impact, input from players is being ignored, and they're so far behind, they'll probably be still &quot;tweaking&quot; (making wholesale changes) up until the next expansion ships.<br />
<br />
Should they have one designer for each class? YES. They're big enough to have that many class devs. Or one dev covering two classes, or having a tank dev, healer dev, a melee dev, and a ranged dev. <br />
<br />
And, they as a team need to decide to never allow this much change over so little time - that's all on Brack and Ion. They've completely disrupted the game and made it unstable. That's not fun. This is gaming, not nuclear engineering, or philosophy, where every aspect needs to be discussed and examined by a committee for some neckbeardy &quot;perfection&quot; or &quot;efficiency&quot; or whatever metric (if any) Celestalon's group uses. That players need to relearn classes that were released in a so-called &quot;finished&quot; state is unacceptable, from a player perspective, and from a professional perspective. I can't think of any games that were released this broken or unfinished, or had so much redone...oh, wait. Diablo III. <br />
<br />
Yeah. Blizzard has institutional problems. Seems to be a theme. They work slowly, and release flawed product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main reason he's wrong to dismiss point 1:<br />
Point 2 and 3 are about how things work in theory whereas point 1 is about how things work in practice.<br />
<br />
Scientists in general can tell you there's a big difference between them and both are very important.<br />
<br />
I agree that we need someone there playing classes/specs regularly at least as an alt so they see the full design picture.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Synapto</div><div class="date">2016-12-28, 02:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did Deathshrimp REALLY say this? &quot;But I’d be interested in understanding *why* so many players think that it’s important that you main X in order to make sure they are designed well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, if we ignore the first-hand fostering of an intrinsic understanding of class mechanics, the first-hand comprehension of the synergy between class ability and playstyle, the first-hand assessment of class (im)balance in any scenario, the first-hand emotional commitment to designing that class well, and if we ignore the utter stupidity of making such a moronic statement in the first place, then I suppose that... NO... you don't need your Warlock designer to play a Warlock (for example).<br />
<br />
In that case, some ignorant drone who cares more about their paycheck than their class design would suit the game well, some blinkered idiot who doesn't understand the indirect (aka diluted or unrepresentative) feedback from some middle-man idiot like the Community Mangers would do fine, some oblivious dolt who doesn't bother to discuss mechanic changes directly with the &quot;unconstructive&quot; playerbase has a future, or some supercilious peasant who promotes their own inadequate concepts ahead of what would universally be recognised as &quot;fun&quot; gets to keep their job.<br />
<br />
Indeed, this is exactly what we used to have from Deathshrimp, and this is exactly what we currently have with the present bunch of degenerate losers at Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Point 2 and 3 are about how things work in theory whereas point 1 is about how things work in practice.<br />
<br />
Scientists in general can tell you there's a big difference between them and both are very important.<br />
<br />
I agree that we need someone there playing classes/specs regularly at least as an alt so they see the full design picture.<br />
<br />
I tend to agree. If they don't have reps that are playing the class and sticking up for the class you get to the point where you feel left out. I also think it's not fair to compare class design from WoW and LoL. In WoW, being an RPG and a game where players have played the same character for a decade, players are more married to their toons then you see in LoL <br />
<br />
Nothing worse then feeling broken for a whole expac (or several) and wondering why you can never get fixed. Or getting glimpses of being fixed for one or two patches, then going right back to being broken. Probably one of the reasons I don't play a DPS shaman (my first main) much anymore. So hit or miss between patches &amp; expacs on whether they will be viable or just plain suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if we ignore the first-hand fostering of an intrinsic understanding of class mechanics, the first-hand comprehension of the synergy between class ability and playstyle, the first-hand assessment of class (im)balance in any scenario, the first-hand emotional commitment to designing that class well, and if we ignore the utter stupidity of making such a moronic statement in the first place, then I suppose that... NO... you don't need your Warlock designer to play a Warlock (for example).<br />
<br />
In that case, some ignorant drone who cares more about their paycheck than their class design would suit the game well, some blinkered idiot who doesn't understand the indirect (aka diluted or unrepresentative) feedback from some middle-man idiot like the Community Mangers would do fine, some oblivious dolt who doesn't bother to discuss mechanic changes directly with the &quot;unconstructive&quot; playerbase has a future, or some supercilious peasant who promotes their own inadequate concepts ahead of what would universally be recognised as &quot;fun&quot; gets to keep their job.<br />
<br />
Indeed, this is exactly what we used to have from Deathshrimp, and this is exactly what we currently have with the present bunch of degenerate losers at Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your point would work in a perfect world where game companies have unlimited resources, and designers were machines.<br />
<br />
Like GC said in his post, there are a lot of factors that go into giving people roles in the class design team. Yes, it would be nice if every game designer was completely and absolutely invested and passionate in WoW for as long as the game exists, but in a realistic scenario this is simply not the case. People change over time, do you expect Blizzard to waste resources and fire anyone who doesn't do their job perfectly?</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's the classes per se, the game really has suffered as a whole because the game hasn't initially changed from WOW WOTLK to WOW CATA and keeping the old raids and dungeons made the game a complete mess nothing really fits anything at all in Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you do anything else? Raiding, Mythics, LFR? Because I'm pretty sure if you bonus roll on anything and win, that resets the 'bad luck protection'.</div></div><hr />

Classic and Legion aren't the same mate. Legion is accesible by everyone, and Classic wasn't. It's obvious that getting loot in Classic had you work for something and gave you a sense of accomplishment. and im talking about Wbosses here, not lootsystem in general.<br />
<br />
Legion is accesible by everyone. It's something else.. everybody can reach out on loot, but for the ones that really need it don't get shit. The loot system is horrible for Wbosses. You dont feel a sense of accomplisment in any way but yet it's so RNG heavy. I even got 2 legendaries in 1 day but getting 1 single Wboss loot seems impossible lmao.. to the point where im thinking meh.. fuck the Wbosses, not even worth trying. It's a pain in the ass tbh since the Wbosses are only lootable once per week. Something so easy is not meant to be that RNG heavy. Luck or bad luck :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course. I'm just saying: it sucks / it's kind'a bullshit that I haven't gotten a single drop in all this time, despite rolling for loot twice each week. (I didn't get any loot this week either, for what it's worth.) Bad luck alone doesn't really tend to extend to this extent, especially nowadays.</div></div><hr />

If no one is playing x or y then there is no problem. Better balanced would probably be achieves is dev was in charge of c y and z was not allowes to play any.<br />
<br />
I think the other issue this xpac is that the &quot;style design&quot; was much more dominant than &quot;balance design&quot;. And this ranged through all aspecs from mythic + dungeons theough to legendaries and Artifact Knoweldge/Power.<br />
<br />
The design te has been fixing the broader issues after the comple screw up with outlaw, (broken to begin with but the nerf hammer was more of a wrecking ball).<br />
<br />
Ps. I started ele but now resto shaman.</div></div><hr />
