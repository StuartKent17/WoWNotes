Mythic Blackrock Foundry Progression<br />
Four guilds are already at 7/10 bosses down, with just a little over a day of progress. You can find lots of discussion in our Raids and Dungeons forum progression thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1707079-Blackrock-Foundry-Mythic-Progression-Thread).<br />

Argi Raises More Than $1.9 Million<br />
It looks like Argi (https://battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-pet-argi) didn't sell quite as well as the Cinder Kitten (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/250516-cinder-kitten-raises-more-than-23-million/) ($2.3 million) or Alterac Brew Pup (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/303989-make-a-wish-charity-pet-thank-you/) ($2 million).<br />

<br />
Thanks to the overwhelming generosity of World of Warcraft players around the world who purchased the Argi pet, weâ€™ve raised a total of more than 1.9 million USD to support the ongoing Ebola relief efforts in Africa by the Red Cross. In December, we announced that for every Argi (https://battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-pet-argi) purchased by December 31, 2014, 100% of the adoption fee would be going to assist in aiding in the fight against this deadly disease -- and the community embraced this cute little intergalactic nibbler, helping out a great cause in the process. Thanks again to everyone who helped make a difference.<br />

Tab Targeting Issues<br />
I want to tab to the nearest enemy and instead it picks a target off in the middle of nowhere<br />
Hrm. That sounds like a bug to me. We can take a look. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/361719-why-is-tab-targeting-so-bad/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16283909065?page=4#74))<br />
<br />
Raid Loot Itemization<br />
Itemization isn't necessarily a science of providing the absolute optimal stats at all times for your character, but usually as an art of creating a progression path throughout the game. In any case though once you've bested Highmaul you'll want to move on to Foundry, and to your point, progress by equipping new items and becoming more powerful. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/361722-raid-loot-itemization-why-is-it-wrong/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16285109103?page=1#12))<br />
<br />
Solo Boss Testing<br />
So if you are not familiar with X-Men, the danger room is a room where they simulate fights. Wouldn't it be cool if we could test our specs/talents on individual bosses without having to get an entire group and, instead, have something like the proving grounds but we could select which boss we wanted to fight. I think that would be nice.<br />
That's kiiiiind of what Brawler's Guild is though, right? Not that you get to select the boss, but seems like it offers that same gameplay. Or do you mean actual raid bosses? Hrm, being able to practice against real raid bosses might pose some issues, specifically for world first kill races, but ... y'know also that seems like it'd kind of cheapen the bosses a bit to me. Might be a lot of work just to be able to sim a fight when it'd probably be a better experience to just be improving and progressing in the raid itself. I don't know, interesting idea to chew on at least. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/361710-danger-room-concept-for-wow/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16285919047?page=1#9))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
will there be another change wave to BRF trinkets like there was for any 6.0 trinket or are they final?<br />
No changes are currently planned but we will be watching out for any that may need adjustments. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/562384100632170496))<br />
<br />
Will Stage 3 crafted items retain their color shift if an iLvl 680 upgrade token is used?<br />
There are currently no plans to visually change items that go from stage 3 to stage 4. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/562401675722231808))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
What are the requirments to get into mythic BRF will the raid need to have killed heroic blackhand ? Thanks<br />
No boss kill requirements necessary. Mythic will be locked for the first week, then open to anyone after; same as Highmaul. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/562403405025406976))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Just did an AB, 5 healers horde vs 0 alliance. Thought this was supposed to be impossible within the WoD system.<br />
seeing uptick in reports on this. Should be rare. Will investigate. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/562077395461500929))<br />
<br />
Holy Prism often breaks my Polymorph in arena, since it bounces to nearby enemies. Is this intended or a design flaw?<br />
Intended. It's designed to do damage to other enemies in the immediate area. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/562394413721079809))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Are the BRF garrison missions going to be available on Tue/Wed this week? Or only when 6.1 goes live?<br />
Blackrock Foundry missions will become available after Patch 6.1 goes live. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/562381698822721536))<br />
<br />
does deactivating a follower strip the gear?<br />
As others have said, follower upgrades will remain after being deactivated/activated. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/562379204474327040))<br />
We should also mention you can upgrade followers who are currently deactivated. =) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/562395908411645952))</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the &quot;every other time&quot; thing; it doesn't always happen. Although when it does work right you'd think it'd start cycling through the guys nearest your target first, but it does eventually cycle through everything.</div></div><hr />

Ok I don't see how 1.9 as opposed to 2.0 or 2.3 is considered &quot;not quite as well&quot;. It's nearly the same amount.<br />

Because these are World First quality raiders. They did exhaustive testing on the PTR to hammer out strategies, and are seriously above-par players. The tuning for the vast majority of mythic raiders is good.</div></div><hr />

7/10 in the first week is less progress than I would have expected. I think Blackrock Foundry is a good challenge.<br />
Question for you: Were you were in a top 100 bleeding edge progression guild when you canceled? If not, why are you judging the game based on this group of players you aren't a part of?<br />
For average players the raids are still quite challenging and quite fun. Most people won't manage to clear much Mythic at all before the next raid tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well. the only way to stop them is creating a dps wall that is impossible to break unless you got at least 5+ items of mythic quality per raid char. But seriously: If it's anyway impossible to reach certain bosses due to dps walls...then for what do you want to include them? Essentially such a dps wall is doing the same as releasing the bosses 4 weeks later.<br />
Or in other word: Your argument is plain BS!<br />
<br />
We want to be able to defeat bosses, so the best WILL defeat them. If it's possible they'll do it...simple as that.</div></div><hr />

I can't count the number of times I tab target and (maybe sometimes) start attacking and hey it was a mob in the next pull and not the one right in front of your face. I mean, it's not something that happens every single time, but it's more common than it should be.<br />
<br />
And people asking devs about deactivated followers... Can't anyone just try something for themselves first? How hard is it to do that?

Why are you so upset at his comment?<br />
<br />
And, you don't have to be able to do something, to have an opinion - if that were true, we'd have no sports commentary, no political or editorial commentary, no art criticism, no music reviews, no movie reviews, or any kind of review or commentary at all. Clearing mythic is not a season pass to being all-knowing and wise - and not clearing it does not forbid one from commenting on it - that's a bogus, arrogant wanna-be elitist attitude, and you need to stop it. <br />
<br />
I have the some opinion - the raid content is being cleared faster than before, or so it seems - I have no interest in researching how long it took in past expansions, and it would be skewed data anyway because of the cockblocks Blizz has put into the raids before. I just remember it taking longer for the top guilds to clear content. I don't know if that's good or bad, because I'm not in those guilds, and I don't know their feelings on the matter - but I would be interested to hear it.<br />
<br />
Or, I could be like you and say &quot;How DARE you peons judge content you are not worthy to step into!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

If the top guilds in the world couldn't clear 7/10 in the first day than 99% of the raiding player base would be unable to clear the instance before the next raid tier. There are hundreds of thousands of people currently progressing through BRF and you're mad that FOUR guilds have cleared 7/10? Think about the scale of the numbers we're talking here. <br />
<br />
Those 4 guilds and everyone else who is 5/10 or so make WoW literally their JOB during progression races. Do you want Blizzard to balance the game for people who make it their job or for people who play it mostly for recreation? In this case you have no right to complain unless you yourself found the instance too easy.<br />

<br />
That was his point. Your logic only applies to criticizing the quality of the content, not the difficulty. Those 4 guilds that are 7/10 literally make the game their JOB during a progression race. Should Blizzard design and balance their video game around the capabilities of people who play their game for money? You have no logical right to criticize the difficulty of something (calling it too easy) unless you yourself have an easy time of it. What it boils down to is that you are calling something too easy and yet you have not cleared it yet. FOUR guilds are 7/10! FOUR guilds, with hundreds of thousands of players progressing through BRF right now.<br />
<br />
If 2,000 guilds were already 7/10 M then you would have a reasonable position.<br />
<br />
Also, they do the instance in order from easiest bosses to hardest. The last 3 that they have not cleared are going to be the most challenging for them.</div></div><hr />
