Cataclysm Beta - Build 12759<br />
A new build is being deployed on beta realms, just like any beta build, it will be painful, a lot of stuff will break, and I have no idea if I'll be able to give you all the content on the first day.<br />
<br />
On the upside, Thrall is getting a new model. Stay tuned for changes!<br />
<br />

Guild Vendor Rewards<br />
The Guild Vendor is here, a lot of items are placeholders but it should give you a pretty good idea of what it will offer.<br />

<br />
<br />
Creature Damage Output Changes<br />
Creature damage output has been increased from roughly level 65 and up. These increases scale upward with level. Creatures in exterior zones at level 80 now have 2.5 times the damage output they did previously in beta, 3.2 times at level 81, and 4 times at level 82 and up.<br />
<br />
We&#8217;d like to get your feedback about how combat feels with creatures in level 80-85 exterior zones, including spawn rates and numbers of creatures in specific locations in each zone. Please let us know if this feels adequately challenging, or if there is a little too much face rocking going on. <br />
<br />
<br />
New Guild Advancement Forum<br />
We've created a Guild Advancement forum to help collect discussions on this new feature coming in Cataclysm. If you have any feedback, want to discuss the guild advancement feature, or have found any issues, please do so within the new forum. Please continue to use the Bug Report forum for actual bug reports.<br />

Have you seen some of the damage in beta? I watched a BM hunter grinding video and the 80 mobs in hyjal hit him for &lt;300 damage in a 50k+ health pool. Doesn't seem like much incentive to stay away from mobs. I actually hope they increase the health of mobs in lower dungeons so they match atleast a little bit, the difficulty of the new dungeons. New players/players returning from a hiatus are going to be in for a rude awakening when they go from faceroll 1-80 to CC &amp; strategies.</div></div><hr />

Geh, I'm sorry, I'm not one for complaining but this kinda makes me sad, and I get the whole Shaman thing he's got going, but why would he throw away Doomhammer's armor, not to mention the Doomhammer.<br />

And Also, why is he leaning forward so much? he looks super old, he is suppose to look proud, not hunched over and old.</div></div><hr />

What gives, Blizzard? Y'all have to make Thrall look so dour? Now Jaina will never go out with him!<br />

They've recycled (most of) the artwork from a Warcraft anniversary double screen wallpaper (I know this because I have it set as my wallpaper at the moment - which can be found here (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/wowanniversary/battlecry/)). They're quite disappointing, really, especially if they're not placeholders.<br />
<br />
Also seeing all 12 leaders together (well in two lots of 6) and only two (one each side) are female makes me sad. (And makes me embarrassingly and humiliatingly grateful that they didn't change the NE leader to Malfurion now he's back.)<br />

My opinion is that statements like the one you made are based off of visceral reactions to cosmetic changes, since that's what you commented on. I did not mean to imply that this was a personal attack; merely that you were basing your opinions off something that was not gameplay related. It was not intended to be trolling, trust me.

This exactly. Also Thrall's new goals of trying to keep Azeroth from tearing itself apart and I would assume sealing the Maelstrom are probably causing him to need to delve deeper into his Shamanistic powers. and his new look reflects that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This may be all bunk, but I read a interesting post in the beta forums. <br />
<br />
Look for a post called &quot;Dalaran grounded...?&quot; by Kyrack<br />
<br />
In it a beta tester discovered odd text in a new quest regarding Dalaran. In it the quest giver you save, mentions heading to Dalaran to to get it flying again. Now folks that know Wow lore, Dalaran never flew till LK. I maybe misreading into it as well, but I thought it was rather odd they made new loading screens for both LK and BC, both intailing the main ending characters. Bolvar looks mighty frustrated, and it been thought a couple times, (plus the clip from Yogg vision) that Ner zhul isn't gone. <br />
<br />
Now my crazy theory is this, what if there are effects of Cata on outlands and Northend? An I can think of one major reason Blizz would do this, there places in both of the expanisions that ALL wow players would still use even after Cata comes out; the portal hubs. They stated there is no set hub in Cata, and wow players to get around speedy would still have our hearth set to Dal, for portal access alone. What if something happens in Cata to Dalaran, makes it crash, damages it, but doesn't destroy it (maybe taking out the portals....) Perhaps a new level 85 raid in both areas. Got to admit it not a bad idea, given a crazy crazy theory. Does any tester have any thing to support this??? I need to ask a data miner if any LK or BC files have been changed..... <br />
<br />
<br />
Dark Phoenix mount makes a little more sense with a new outlands raid.... just saying <br />
and yes my walls are covered with pictures of wow, with yarn and thumb tacks linking them.<br />

He's a shaman and embracing his shamanistic powers, after having his powers awoken from the cataclysm or whatnot<br />

<br />
there are quite a few, i'm sure there will be a list soon on the main site<br />
<br />
<br />
but a few that come to mind are Light of Dawn scaling with Holy Power, IMP Crusader strike gone again, now a talent that speeds up the CD based on your haste, and there is a ret talent (that i'm sure holy will get) that gives Word of Glory a 20/40% chance to not consume Holy Power.

Brand new accounts are the ones most commonly used for trolling/flaming/QQing; nothing I said indicates that higher post count = superiority, unless taken out of context, which would probably happen if someone was insecure enough to build up a mental image of someone based on their time spent on the forums..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The loading screens are awesome in showing who is currently in charge within Outland and Northrend, but there's a weird disconnect going on in the EK/Kalimdor ones. I mean... with virtually every racial leader coming from the Battlecry mosaic, even Garrosh was drawn by the same guy... yet the goblin and worgen images break the style. Yes, I'm nagging about an artistic thing :p Even though the current loading screens are a mix of styles as well (GENZOMAN's blood elf vs the steampunk-ish Forsaken on the same loading screen).<br />

No, you don't. It is only an option if you want it.<br />
You're under no obligation to buy it. <br />
<br />
I think it is just for people who complain about never being able to get and use a 310% mount. So now there is no excuse for complainers not being able to get 310% flying, when you can buy it.<br />
<br />
It is a matter of it you want to buy it, not that you have to buy it.</div></div><hr />

Also, for anyone who is in the beta, Is there any storyline reference as to the time jump that seems to exist from leveling from 1-60 in the post Cataclysm world, then going to Outlands and Northrend basically in the past and then going back to the post Cataclysm world for 80-85? I mean, with the new loading screens it even shows Bolvar as the Lich King even though I am guessing there are still a ton of mentions to Arthas in the Northrend quest line.<br />
<br />
P.S. I think Thrall looks awesome. My one small complaint is that he isn't wearing anything that pays homage to his Frostwolf background. You would think they would at least give him a Frostwolf belt buckle or something.</div></div><hr />

first, you skipped a step for that first 5k to make the difference larger than it is, and second, you have to compare them in terms of how much 5k is actully worth at the time, during bc 5k is alot more than it is now, and in cataclysm 5k will be chump change</div></div><hr />

New models look amazing, I love the guild rewards (Woo I can finally get a Phoenix mount, never even seen the normal thing drop.) The new loading screens look epic although I'm not sure why the Northrend one needed changing. I'm REALLY excited for the relics having stats on them, hopefully this means they're paying more attention to them than in Wrath. *looks at how the BiS libram for Paladins was an iLvl 200 for a majority of Wrath* Lastly, the holy power thing looks nice. I was expecting something just like 3 bubbles, each with a cross, that glowed golden when you had holy power.<br />
<br />
Also I'm glad those with a 310% mount already get it for free, unlike some (most?) people I don't have otherworldly gold gathering powers and 5k is a bit hard for me to come by since I'm not persistent enough to do all the dailies possible every day and I don't have a gathering profession. Truth be told I've only had over 5k twice, and one was only for about 5 minutes and then it was spent on 280% training.</div></div><hr />

You're right that isn't fun too. I didn't say we need those relics though. I'm talking about the ones that affect a particular spell. That way you have to pick which relic you need for which encounter and you can even switch them up in combat. Now I have a wand that doesn't shoot anything.</div></div><hr />

I got 5K gold just by levelling 70-80 doing only quests. And you can bet the cataclysm quests and mobs will drop a lot more gold. So 5K for 280% is pretty much given for any new player 81+. Another 5K will just come along naturally.</div></div><hr />

He looks like a bum to me in this ragged cloth with chains around his waist and hands and weird bead. I personally expected to see him wearing something like shaman tier2.<br />
Oh and new loading screens are cooler than old ones although I don't get what's Lavaman doing with his hands on Northrend one.</div></div><hr />

Apparently putting 1000% more effort into this game than everyone else can't even get you 30% faster mounts. At least I get my cool looking armor. Oh wait, casuals can get that too. Well at least I get to experience the epicness that is end game. No wait, that's not exclusive anymore either. Well at least..... Well crap; hope you casuals are all happy with yourselves for dumbing down the game.<br />

If it's elitism and exclusiveness that you want, join the Bilderberg Group. Now stop being a goddamn sourpuss.</div></div><hr />
