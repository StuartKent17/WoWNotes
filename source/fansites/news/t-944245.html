Every now and then I have people asking me about a potential ETA for the beta of Diablo 3. This is a pretty hard question to answer but we can guess that it will be available very soon. <br />
<br />
1. Activision Earning Call - During the latest conference call (http://www.diablofans.com/topic/24865-may-9th-conference-call/), Activision announced that the beta would start during Q3 2011, that's between July 1st and September 30th.<br />
<br />
2. Press Tour - A Diablo 3 press tour is scheduled for Diablo fansites on August 1st, this is pretty much what happened with Cataclysm with the Press Tour happening 2 weeks before the start of beta.<br />
<br />
3. Box Art - Last but not least, the Diablo 3 beta box art has been uploaded on the european battle.net last week, Blizzard seems to be getting ready for a launch &quot;soon&quot; - https://eu.battle.net/account/local-common/images/game-boxes/en-gb/d3-big.png (Thanks to Fisker (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/520435-FISKER_Q) for finding that one)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm not saying that it will happen omg omg omg super soon, because beta get postponed easily but things are definitely moving forward and I wouldn't be surprised to see something happen a few days after the press event. <br />
<br />
For more information on Diablo 3 and a coverage of the press tour, your best bet is to keep an eye on Diablofans.com (http://www.diablofans.com/topic/24865-may-9th-conference-call/)<br />

Addon Review - PassLoot (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
PassLoot (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/pass-loot.aspx) is another great addon for lazy efficient players who don't want to continue to do the mindless loot rolls necessary in groups. It allows very complex or very simple filter settings that will take over looting for you. You can filter by item level, name, quality, type, slot, class, spec, group status, uniqueness, and much more. It even allows for removal of the confirmation popups for BoP and DE actions. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Download PassLoot @ Curse.com (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/pass-loot.aspx)<br />
<br />
<br />
After installing PassLoot, open the menu in game with &quot;/passloot menu&quot;. This is where the filter magic happens. First Add a filter, then click on the Temp Description to change the name in the box below. Press enter after you change the name to something useful. Some of the easier filters to setup are for green quality items. <br />
<br />
To DE or Greed green quality items in 5 man dungeons, first add the Confirm DE option from the list on the left if you want to skip confirmation. Then add Group / Raid and set it to either Group or Any depending on if you want the filter to be active in raids as well. Next is Item Level filters, generally it is safe to DE anything from 100 to 319 as there are some holiday and other items that have a level less than 100. Finally add a filter for Quality and set it to Uncommon. This means that the addon will only roll on Green items. Other handy filters are Usable, Zone Type, and Equip Slot. Below are two example filters I have used in the past to get you going.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/july/passloot_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/july/passloot.png)<br />
<br />
You can set up similar filters for blues or epics depending on your guild's loot rules for raids, as well as filtering by item name, type, slot, or zone. Take care to set your filters correctly to avoid DEing something you really wanted to keep as GMs will not undo your mistakes. This should help to remove most of the mindless looting from your PvE and let you focus on not standing in the fire!<br />
<br />
Under the Output menu you can control the notifications of actions taken by the addon. It can output to many different sources, including many SCT addons or raid warnings, so that you don't miss the action it takes.<br />
<br />
<br />
NPCScan Update<br />
It's also a good occasion to point out that NPCScan (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/npcscan.aspx) has been updated for Patch 4.2 last week and as usual, it will make your rare elite hunting considerably easier.<br />
<br />

Comic-Con - Blizzard Panel - WoW, Diablo, StarCraft Swag<br />
Blizzard had a 1 hour long panel at Comic-con focused on WoW/Diablo/Starcraft merchandising, you won't really hear anything new about the game but you will probably learn a few things on what's coming for WoW TCG, comics, and other products. <br />

If yu set it to automatically need items you deserve to be called all the names you'll inevitable get. Passloot is awesome for say my raid geared main who has absolutely no need of any loot at all (thus greeds everything). It's also good for say my priest who can just instantly greed/de any leather+ that comes along but not cloth (so I can look whether it's an upgrade and manually need/greed as appropriate). But it will never replace the &quot;which button do I click?&quot; bit of loot rolls 100% and it shouldn't.<br />
<br />
e: I should also add that taking loot, regardless of manual or automatic, from a dick just makes you a dick too.</div></div><hr />

I would think they'd wait until about 2 months after SWTOR is released before they release D3.<br />

Quick to fix there, i was a bit confused why Q3 was only 2 months and 1 day so i had to google it. :p<br />

And one of the better addons indeed, PassLoot saved me alot of time when autolooting all the bosses i killed while farming the Baron mount!<br />

That being said, D3 won't replace or win over SWTOR. They are totally different games. I honestly can't see me playing a Diablo game in years to come. Strictly speaking it's not an MMORPG, so they will occupy different markets anyway.</div></div><hr />

If financial news are to be accurate, the Q2 earnings call is on August 3rd, otherwise we may just have to wait until BlizzCon in October for an actual launch date (if it gets a launch date, that is).</div></div><hr />

If you have any scope of how powerfull Diablo is in Europe you would understand.<br />
<br />
A HUGE! proportion of wow players will &quot; take a break &quot; when diablo 3 comes out especially Germans as they are probably the biggest die hard fans of Diablo in Europe.<br />
<br />
Starwars Galaxies is WoW reskinned in the starwars universe and is in no way inovative ( nothing wrong with this ) , everyone knows this so the only reasons you are going to player starwars is &quot; The starwars world and lore &quot; or because you just want a &quot; change from wow &quot; both are acceptable reasons.<br />
<br />
The most exciting parts about an mmo in total are days 1-7 ( the learning days ) if you dont hook people in on those days you can forget it. Diablo 3 will hit that period to cause as much damage as possible.<br />
<br />
On another note. Diablo 3 may just come out when its ready and a great patch can be held back when necessary. The more competition blizzard has the more they will have to feed our content demands , its only a good thing , and vice versa Starwars will probably be pretty basic to start off with but im feeling like once the playerbase is formed content will come quick and fast for them also.</div></div><hr />

I mean seriosly, i loved Diablo 2 with all my heart and i played it god knows how long, but do u guys really think it will become such a big hit in the long run ? Nowadays people want MMORPG's including me , with a big open world.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong, Diablo 3 will be nice and prolly be selling like crazy, but i doubt that it will kill WoW and such</div></div><hr />

Diablo has that addictive quality that makes you play for one more hour or go for just one more boss run coz you never know what you may get. Its a grinder's dream come true so yea, there will definitely be a lot of MMO players who would skip it but i'am sure there will be enough people who will pick it up assuming it doesn't stray too far from it's predecessor's formula.<br />
<br />
I have about 8-9 irl friends who avoid WoW and other MMOs like the plague but would easily sell their souls to pick up Diablo 3. Also keep in mind, that it does not have a monthly sub like WoW which is a big deal for a lot of people. I used to laugh when people used to say that Diablo 3 would be THE &quot;Wow-killer&quot; but having seen some of the systems they have revealed, i am beginning to think they might have a point.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if its sarcasm or not but thanks. Usually when I spout cold truth i get flamed to death.<br />
<br />
People would rather stand around ignorantly then hear the sad truth. When they do hear the truth, they throw a fit with a vengeance, defending something that dosn't need defending and defiantly make the system worse. It's a law of the internet, for every sensible person there are 12 loudmouths willing to back up any stupid thing (like paying $25 for one mount or even pet).<br />
<br />
Anyways that's enough ranting, I should stop before I get the attention of the very fools I speak of, cause lord knows they wont listen, they'll just ironically continue to make fools of themselves.</div></div><hr />

Too much strong words, too much non-sense <br />
And keep in mind, I don't play WoW... Didn't buy mounts or pets for real money.. but you are pathetic..not the crowd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no I'm pretty sure it's the crowd. I never bought useless mounts, I don't waste countless nights on raid bosses. Like I said I left the game because the playerbase was far too annoying. Good job flaming me, defending nobody, for no reason though. Enjoy being a mindless fanboy.</div></div><hr />
