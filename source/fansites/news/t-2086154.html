Patron of War Title<br />
The Patron of War title has been handed out in the US and EU. If you don't already have it, be sure to link your Twitch account and watch the arena games this weekend (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/771907-watch-the-world-of-warcraft-arena-regional-championship-and-earn-a-title/)!<br />

<br />
Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - October 6<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Warlock<br />
<br />
(Destruction) Dimensional Rift will no longer spawn portals that are out of range to do damage to your target.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic Keystone Dungeons<br />
<br />
Artifact Power rewards from end-of-run Mythic Keystone chests now increases with the Level of the Mythic Keystone Dungeon.<br />
When beating a Mythic Keystone timer by a margin so significant that your Keystone is upgraded by more than one step, you will earn multiple loot chests as before, however, the additional chests beyond the first will no longer contain Artifact Power.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: These changes are aimed at aligning the efficiency of the different tiers of difficulty, so that a well-geared group of dungeon experts is rewarded more for tackling a high-level Mythic dungeon, rather than incentivized to stomp an entry-level dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
The Archaeology World Quest heirloom reward Spear of Rethu should now be item level 700, as intended (was item level 605).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Changes to Mythic Keystone Rewards<br />
We’re deploying a hotfix as soon as possible that will change some of the contents of the chests at the end of Mythic Keystone dungeon runs:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Artifact Power contained in Challenger’s Cache awarded for completing a given difficulty will now contain increasing amounts of Artifact Power depending on the difficulty cleared. Prior to the hotfix, this Cache contained 400 base (pre-Knowledge-modifier) Artifact Power. After the hotfix:<br />
Mythic 2-3: 500 base Artifact Power Mythic 4-6: 800 base Artifact Power Mythic 7-9: 1000 base Artifact Power Mythic 10+: 1200 base Artifact Power<br />
At the same time, any additional (bonus) chests awarded for beating the Mythic Keystone timer by a very large amount will no longer contain any Artifact Power. They will still contain items of the appropriate power level, as before. All Challenger’s Caches will now also contain gold.<br />
<br />
The bonus chests you receive when you dominate a dungeon so thoroughly that your Keystone upgrades multiple times are intended to make sure that you don’t miss out on loot. You shouldn’t feel like it’s a mistake to blow away the timer. However, Artifact Power is available in nearly every type of endgame content, so your other reward for going faster is time saved, and that time could be spent pursuing more Artifact Power from its many other sources.<br />
<br />
These changes are aimed at aligning the efficiency of the different tiers of difficulty, so that a well-geared group of dungeon experts is rewarded more for tackling a high-level Mythic dungeon, rather than incentivized to stomp an entry-level dungeon.<br />

PvP<br />
y0 holinka my boi in 7.1 will prestige players have access to all talents even if they lost them by prestiging before the patch?<br />
that's the plan (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/782069018958057472))<br />
<br />
Is there any planned fix for PvP runeforging for Frost DKs? It's still not working.<br />
It is working in 7.1. It was thought to work with Artifact weapons in 7.0.3. Apparently there are issues still. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/782079539841081345))<br />
<br />
really should return to the old ways of the pvp vendors and get rid of the RNG system all together for pvp.<br />
Current system isn't tuned correctly. Understand transitioning from a place where you always got exactly what you wanted is hard (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/782079953609252864))</div></div><hr />

Entirely possible it just hasn't gone out for everyone yet. They weren't actually supposed to go out until both events were over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They seem to be looking at it as user error for not obtaining it since there is no mention that it's a bug:<br />
<br />
<br />
Players who watched the EU Championship Finals may have received their title already, but we aren’t done! You need to connect Twitch to your Battle.net account and watch either of the Regional Championships while logged in. <br />
<br />
Some folks who did connect already, watched, but didn't receive the title may not have been logged into the account while watching the stream. Luckily there is the North American Regional Championships this weekend. If you don’t receive the title by the NA Finals, try logging in again and watching on the Twitch website.<br />

I don't believe this is accurate at all. A very common security practice for WoW is to use an email that isn't used anywhere else. Blizzard would not screw over a large chunk of the playerbase like that.</div></div><hr />

This includes uBlock Origin and AdBlock, as well as the more obvious NoScript and the like. Twitch tracks your viewing status repeatedly by running a tracking script and this gets blocked by all the major blockers, so as far as Twitch knows you aren't watching. So if you really want the title, disable it for Twitch during the stream.<br />
<br />
Blizzard and Twitch have done other promos like this in the past for Heroes of the Storm and so many people were not credited for watching because of adblocking. Eventually Blizzard figured it out and they changed the promo to simply be that you need to link your Twitch and Blizzard accounts, without needing to be tracked as a viewer.<br />
<br />
No fucking clue why they have reverted to this model with the Arena streams.</div></div><hr />

Can confirm that I don't use an adblocker though, perhaps adblock was incorrectly blocking whatever they use to detect you viewing??? Maybe turn it off for this weekend's games.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I am really not a fan of reusing old dungeons (understatement) but I don't think they could have done a better job. It looks like fun. And most fights are pretty much the same. Too bad Netherspite is not in there and the chess event isn't the same.</div></div><hr />

There has been little to no real content for PVPers for 2 whole expansions. The vaunted revamp in this one is about half of our spellbook that was pruned from PVE, and half total garbo abilities like Blood for Blood for DKs (seriously, -5% health on our main RP builder, who thought that was a good idea?). 2 new arena maps, that are cut and paste from areas already built in the open world...honestly how long did that take them to make, a weekend? Not to mention the fact that for the vast majority of the playerbase the easiest way to get honor points is to do Warden Towers, which are objectively not PVP.<br />
<br />
I love Heroes of the Storm, but ever since that came out (and now Overwatch) and Blizzard gave up on the idea of WoW PVP being an &quot;e-sport&quot; they've more or less just left it DOA with talking bobbleheads like Holinka in charge.</div></div><hr />

Looks like Karazhan and that's who it was suppose to look like.<br />
<br />
God forbid I don't like something. Jesus christ. Also Karazhan is a place not a person :)</div></div><hr />

I don't care if they rehash Karazhan. Just never enjoyed the raid personally and probably will check out the dungeon at least and that's it.<br />

This includes uBlock Origin and AdBlock, as well as the more obvious NoScript and the like. Twitch tracks your viewing status repeatedly by running a tracking script and this gets blocked by all the major blockers, so as far as Twitch knows you aren't watching. So if you really want the title, disable it for Twitch during the stream.<br />
<br />
Blizzard and Twitch have done other promos like this in the past for Heroes of the Storm and so many people were not credited for watching because of adblocking. Eventually Blizzard figured it out and they changed the promo to simply be that you need to link your Twitch and Blizzard accounts, without needing to be tracked as a viewer.<br />
<br />
No fucking clue why they have reverted to this model with the Arena streams.<br />
<br />
Ugh. Thank you. This would explain why I didn't get it. I'll just load it up in Edge and mute the stream</div></div><hr />

Well the event is over and I watched it on separate browsers, some without having any script or adblockers ever installed, and still no title. So we'll see what happens. I'm doubtful though.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, add me to the list of those who didn't get it despite following all the instructions. The official Blizz forums are no help either, with CM's telling us that it's not their problem, and the fanbois rabidly downvoting anybody who asks for help.</div></div><hr />
