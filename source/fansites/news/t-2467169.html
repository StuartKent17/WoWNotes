The Zandalari ones though, not feeling it. As someone else said, they don't compete with Darkspear whatsoever.<br />

I actually don't mind that the female troll dance is the gwara gwara (which is South African), considering that the Zandalari Trolls have mainland African accents, as opposed to the other Trolls with Caribbean accents. Though, they do obviously have Pre-Columbian architecture and clothing as well, so it could have gone either way.</div></div><hr />

It looks more like the female troll is going into convulsions rather than doing a proper dance. At least with the other races, the dances have something that is more like a dance, and recognizable as such, instead of the pretty lame movements that they choice for this. I can't say I am much for the Kul Tiran Female dance either. Can't tell is she is trying to exercise, or getting ready to body slam someone... LOL!</div></div><hr />

The female Kul Tiran in particular has a short dance that just repeats. (Anyone else think of the hippo/croc ballet from fantasia with this?)</div></div><hr />

I could guess quite quickly with the older ones, but these? No idea. Tbh, the KT male one looks like any drunk ass man in a club flailing around, and the female one like a fat chick in her room pretending to be a ballet dancer.<br />
<br />
Both shit to my mind.</div></div><hr />

Male Nelf says hello. Not sure about Forsaken female. I think its not that bad if the dance is actually quite good. <br />

Zandalari troll male dance kinda reminds me of Wildstar (anyone still remeber?) male's dance.</div></div><hr />

Because, up until these, the other allied races were just re-skins of existing races.<br />

Yeah but like... that's how all the dances are except maybe Pandaren male?<br />
<br />
Undead just headbang and then jump, Night elf female grinds left, then right, then down.<br />

At least those dances are pretty fluid and that's most of what they are. They are based on a single signature move and need little else. These are dances made with multiple moves with no finisher. I'd expect them to be more 'complete' like the BEs' dances, which include several moves before they repeat. I think the KT male's are the most 'done' looking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel like the Zandalari would've been fun doing some variation of 'the robot', maybe like legit hip-hop dancers do today. For Kul Tirans... Well, I'm honestly still shocked that we're getting &quot;fat humans&quot; as a playable race, but their dance feels like it's missing some personality. I honestly don't have a suggestion, though.</div></div><hr />

male zandalari troll dance is the internet joke of the year!<br />
<br />
every lifeform on azeroth that see this dance must think the zandalari trolls are complete idiots..<br />
<br />
I mean, kinda not cool to make fun of artifican dance style but up to you buddy :P its based on real dancing so.. I mean have you seen the &quot;fart wafting&quot; of the female night elf?<br />

<br />
Yeah but like... that's how all the dances are except maybe Pandaren male?<br />
<br />
Undead just headbang and then jump, Night elf female grinds left, then right, then down.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure female dwarves only have a single animation for their dance, and undead female.<br />
<br />
yeah people have quite the rose tinted goggles.<br />
and i mean how can this NOT BE THE BEST DANCE!?<br />

At least those dances are pretty fluid and that's most of what they are. They are based on a single signature move and need little else. These are dances made with multiple moves with no finisher. I'd expect them to be more 'complete' like the BEs' dances, which include several moves before they repeat. I think the KT male's are the most 'done' looking.<br />
<br />
uhh what? some of the dances are literally based off nothing.<br />
<br />
the dwarf female is just genaric river dancing.<br />
the blood elf is some audition of toxic from youtube that like no one saw, draenei female is generic belly dancing, the tauren male is... something... and peanut butter jelly time? wut? Undead female i also think generic belly dancing, undead is just.. jumping and head banging, female gnome is just.. generic something...? Male troll is just generic street dancing.<br />
<br />
alot of these are not &quot;signature moves&quot; and alot of them are not multiple moves, they are one animation repeated with the odd thing breaking it up. Tarune is literally 2, peanut butter jelly and the twist like dance. Draenei female is just belly dance and then turn. Most of the dances are literally just 2 animations changed back and forth.<br />
<br />

No, the idea is if people like the video.. therefore the dance. If every one just likes the video for mmo-champion, we can assume everyone likes the dance then?<br />

Draenei female is generic belly dancing, not really an &quot;iconic dance&quot;<br />
Undead male... well its just head bobbing and jumping, undead female again generic not anything iconic.<br />
tauren male is peanut butter jelly plus... something...<br />
Troll male is generic.<br />
yeah the blood elf female is just an... audition for some reason<br />
<br />
and yeah alot of people seem to forget iterally all of the normal race dances are just 2 animations that swap randomly back and forth.<br />
<br />
also can i just say how lovely it is the goblins were soulja boy dance, and now hes making illegal bootleg systems that are really just chinexe ripoffs with his name posted on them?<br />

It kind of pisses me off when people say this, there is literally nothing African about the Zandalari besides their random Ugandan accent and Wakanda memes. The architecture, gods, culture, art style everything scream mesoamerican. I don't really care about the dances, but I always found the Wakanda references a bit hamfisted, especially since the expac came out around the time the movie was out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Destinas</div><div class="date">2019-02-13, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always tough that zandalari were inspired by the Aztec, Mayans or some other north american culture.

<br />
All trolls are a combination of different cultures. Darkspear/Jungle Trolls have Afro-Caribbean accents, they use Pacific Tikis, their religion is a mixture of West African and Caribbean Vodun, and their architecture is Mesoamerican. This is the case with most other troll tribes. The Drakkari are a bit more unique (having a whole zone), influenced by other cultures as well - they use stone versions of Chinese paper lanterns, they have Roman aquaducts, and their temples/homes are a mixture of Pre-Columbian and Southeast Asian/Indian.<br />
<br />
Having the Zandalari as a mixture of Mesoamerican and African/Caribbean fits the bill perfectly.</div></div><hr />

&quot;dances based off of nothing&quot; --&gt; Immediately goes to say what they're based off of. Sure. Unless you misunderstood me. I'm not sure what you meant there.<br />
<br />
My point was that despite some of dances for the races being just one move, it doesn't matter too much because that is essentially the entire dance. They also loop easily/endlessly pretty well because of that. The BE dance consist of multiple parts/motions for the full routine, even if that's just 2-3 dance moves. The KT's dance is most similar to this because it's a mix of multiple moves for the entire routine. I just wished there was a cleaner transition between moves or a better finisher before it loops, like w/ BEs.</div></div><hr />

I actually said signature which is a word over distinction, not popularity. And in context, I was talking about dances based upon a singular/main move. Hence, the signature dance move for each race. <br />
<br />
So you actually misunderstood me. I was complaining that the animation could be smoother, bc they look unfinished as we see them. It feels like something is missing</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the Kul Tirans, the male one is kinda funny for the meme which is how dances generally go, they are either a meme or have some sort of cultural significance (Darkspear Troll's Capoeira for example) <br />
<br />
Now I love Ballet, I really do, but if I'm gonna be completely honest, culturally it'd totally fit the Nightborne much better. If my Nightborne females would dance ballet I'd be mesmerized. Kul Tirans are sea people, their society seems to be based of Britain/Nordic sailor culture so some dances that were actually reminiscent of that reality would fit them much better, but that's just what I think.<br />
<br />
Regardless I hope every single one of these will be improved instead of just such short loops, specially the Ballet one because it's not fluid and mesmerizing enough and that's too bad...</div></div><hr />

I don't think gwara gwara fits Zandalari, they only have african accents but their main theme is that they're more sophisticatef than other trolls and not so tribal. This is why dance that imitates monkey movements looks jarring to me, I'd much better like if they went Rio de Janeiro theme and would much better fit Zandalari culture considering they like impressive featherly hats and masks.<br />

The female KT just does a leg kick and pause, an arm raise and pause, a dip and pause. It seems slow, awkward, and lazy from a design point.<br />

It could be argued that the Zandalari and other trolls mirror the cultures of Africa and the Caribbean in real life. The Zandalari have the most renowned Loa, while the other trolls have their more localized Loa. This is similar to West African Vodun, which changed form to Vodou in the Caribbean, but has many similarities to the root religion. <br />
<br />
Not to mention, much of the Caribbean and South America is a mixture of African, European, and Mesoamerican culture. Thus why in the Dominican Republic, they have their own Vudú (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Vud%C3%BA) - it's called the same thing in Puerto Rico as well. Same with Brazillian Vodum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candombl%C3%A9_Jej%C3%A9). Same with Cuban Vodú (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Vod%C3%BA). There were also masks (https://www.tripsavvy.com/story-behind-the-vejigante-mask-of-puerto-rico-1622305) used in Puerto Rico by the Taino people, which are still common today.<br />
<br />
Just by the inspiration of what Zandalar's culture is, it's all a mixture of African and Mesoamerican stuff. Though, having a South American dance at least for Zandalari males would have been fitting, since no one seems to know what the dance is a reference to anyway.</div></div><hr />

How do you figure? I wouldn't exactly call a lot of the dances for old races very interesting. And these are allied races getting a new dance. They easily coulda just tossed the human and troll dances on them and called it a day.</div></div><hr />

This, but I also highly doubt it. Blizz has been way too radio silent lately, launched things that were massively reported as buggy and issues on betas, then gone &quot;oh oops, we didn't know it was going to be this bad!&quot;</div></div><hr />

This is why dance that imitates monkey movements looks jarring to me, I'd much better like if they went Rio de Janeiro theme and would much better fit Zandalari culture considering they like impressive featherly hats and masks.<br />
<br />
Besides troll women have long and beautiful legs so their dance should use those attributes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramz</div><div class="date">2019-02-14, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It could be argued that the Zandalari and other trolls mirror the cultures of Africa and the Caribbean in real life. The Zandalari have the most renowned Loa, while the other trolls have their more localized Loa. This is similar to West African Vodun, which changed form to Vodou in the Caribbean, but has many similarities to the root religion. <br />
<br />
Not to mention, much of the Caribbean and South America is a mixture of African, European, and Mesoamerican culture. Thus why in the Dominican Republic, they have their own Vudú (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominican_Vud%C3%BA) - it's called the same thing in Puerto Rico as well. Same with Brazillian Vodum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candombl%C3%A9_Jej%C3%A9). Same with Cuban Vodú (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Vod%C3%BA). There were also masks (https://www.tripsavvy.com/story-behind-the-vejigante-mask-of-puerto-rico-1622305) used in Puerto Rico by the Taino people, which are still common today.<br />
<br />
Just by the inspiration of what Zandalar's culture is, it's all a mixture of African and Mesoamerican stuff. Though, having a South American dance at least for Zandalari males would have been fitting, since no one seems to know what the dance is a reference to anyway.<br />
<br />
I disagre their mesoamerican influence is so dominant that they should've stick up to the theme. People were already baffled by african accents instead of having typical mimicing the said mesoamerican languages. <br />
<br />
Also the dances would fit much more their sophisticated lifestyles, and nature. They're not like any other troll tribe that could have a little bit more wild dance, but Zandalari female doing something that resembles retarding twerking with shaky leg just ruins it for me.<br />
<br />
I know I'll never use /dance on any of my Zandalari toons if this is gonna be implemented like that.<br />

<br />
I know where it came from but that Crapanada references needs to stop, they're not cool. They should've stick to culture that actually existed and had much better connection to Zandalari so Mesoamricans. I know that my suggestion - so samba is rather modern (? I'm no dance expert) but it would much better fit Zandalari females and would nicely line up with their long legs and slender figures.</div></div><hr />

1. The female BE dance is primarily pulled from the Britney Spears &quot;Toxic&quot; music video. This single was only a couple of years old when Vanilla / BC came out.<br />
2. Shakira is easily the best known dancing pop-star in the US that did belly dancing. She was at the height of her fame in the US when Vanilla / BC came out. <br />
<br />
It was pretty obvious to anyone who was old enough to be aware of pop culture in general at the time where those dances came from. Looking back, you don't have that context, so your mistake is understandable.</div></div><hr />

It definitely is not. You can check the video yourself, it has next to no choreographed dancing, and the little it has is not even similar to the Belf female dance. I don't know if the dance is modeled after Britney's choreo from some other performance, but it 100% is not from Toxic's music video.</div></div><hr />

2. shakira is very well known. But she uses NONE of those moves. she just did bellydancing, and the draenei moves are belly dancing, which the draenei's moves do not even show up, they are &quot;based&quot; off shakira's belly dancing aparently.<br />

so the blood elf female dance is a compilation of like 9 dance moves from all different britney spears dances, which i have yet to see ever one of them. so its rather forgetable, but yes it is... loosly based off britney spears.</div></div><hr />

You see a bit of the dance when she's doing the crazy Bloodrayne segment of the video, but it's much more prominent in her live performances. <br />

The female blood elf dance has 3 primary components. 2 of those 3 are from the Toxic live performances.<br />

Also the dances would fit much more their sophisticated lifestyles, and nature. They're not like any other troll tribe that could have a little bit more wild dance, but Zandalari female doing something that resembles retarding twerking with shaky leg just ruins it for me. <br />
<br />
Well of course you're welcome to your opinion on the dances, but there's not much to disagree with as far as actual history and the actual influences of Zandalar's culture now. The only people that I've seen complaining about African accents are people that don't understand the history of the real world influences in Zandalar's cultures. <br />
<br />
Their buildings and clothing are Mesoamerican, their religion, tapestries, masks, huts, and even some weapons are much more African inspired, or a mixture of Aztec and African cultures. Which mirrors modern cultures in the Caribbean and South America due to the Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and English.<br />
<br />
Also that &quot;retarding twerking&quot; (as you put it) is based off of traditional African dancing. You don't have to like it, but i find it a bit insensitive to hear it described in such a manner. Things like samba and salsa are a mixture of different dance styles from Europe, Africa, and South American native dancing, which is much more modern, but it would somewhat fit the Zandalari as well. Especially considering that the Darkspear capoeira is a martial art based off of mixed cultures as well. <br />
<br />
But, if they wanted to truly lean in to the Mesoamerican theme in their dances, that's not the European ballroom-inspired dancing you're thinking of. It's all very spiritual, similar to the Native American dances in North America and the traditional tribal dances of Africa as well.<br />

<br />
The Zandalari are far from brand new skeletons. The male is the male night elf skeleton and the Female is the female troll skeleton. As for Kul Tirans, still not certain if it is a new skeleton or a modified existing skeleton.<br />
<br />
While i'm happy they get new dances and animation sets i'm disappointed that other allied races didn't get anything for emotes. They had good chances to do some like give Male Nightborne Smooth Criminal, Void elf Male getting the dance from pulp fiction. and Female Nightborne doing Ballet as examples.</div></div><hr />

They were night elve skeletons until they were changed. they are modified versions of them.<br />
just like how the infernal mount WAS the gron/yeti skeleton... until it got changed, it is still the same skeleton, just molded into a new use.<br />

Where did you see african influence in 5.2? I didn't spot any. I can also tell you what roleplayers said and what I saw on various platforms that vast majority of people desired for Zandalari to focus entierly on mesoamerican theme. <br />
<br />
Their buildings and clothing are Mesoamerican, their religion, tapestries, <br />
masks, huts, and even some weapons are much more African inspired, or a mixture of Aztec and African cultures. No even Zandalari wooden huts had clearly defined aesthetic that cannot be mistaken with african ones. Sooner blood trolls would fit tha criteria and for them I wouldn't mind the gwara gwara dance. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;retarded twerking&quot; was aimed for animation on the model alone to emphasise how much I dislike it, I know that RL dancers would pull it off better but in game on Zandalari female it just looks awkward and misplaced. They're high caste of the trolls, proud and tall so it's jarring to see them doing a dance that is about to &quot;get low&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I posted for a male Cancheros dance proposition, and since Darkspear female had belly dance to emphasise their sexappeal I don't see why for the same reason and for the sake of fun they wouldn't for Rio de Janeiro theme, samba is focusing on keeping your torso and head up while making other body parts move. This is the reason why I think it would fit better.<br />
<br />
I am absolutely sure the current dance will stay, so I'll just refuse to use it on Zandalari female and male alike as I really dislike both of them.</div></div><hr />
