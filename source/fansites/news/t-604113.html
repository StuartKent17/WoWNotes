PTR Upgrade - 2.4 ?<br />
Blizzard is doing a 3 days maintenance on PTR servers at the beginning of next week. <br />
In order to perform maintenance, all PTRs will be taken down on January 7th at 18:00 Paris time (CET). We currently expect the PTRs to be back during the evening of January 10th.<br />
<br />
Wait, is this supposed to be interesting ?<br />
Actually, yes but it depends a lot on how you interpret it. <br />
Theory #1 : They want to upgrade PTR servers for some reasons, just to not get surprised when they decide to release the 2.4 on PTRs but not necessarily this week.<br />
Theory #2 : That's what would happen in a perfect world. It could mean that 2.3.2 testing is finished and the patch will be deployed on live servers Tuesday (US) and Wednesday (EU). This would mean that the PTR servers could be back the next day with the 2.4 patch on it available for testing, it wouldn't be surprising and it would perfectly explains why Blizzard needs 3 days of PTR downtime. <br />
<br />
Of course that's just speculation and nothing is official, but you might want to keep a close look on the site next week. <br />

Battleground AFK Reporting Hotfix<br />
The title is pretty clear, the report tool is being hotfixed to make it more efficient.<br />
To help improve the quality of play in Battlegrounds we have applied a Hotfix that significantly reduces the number of AFK reports needed to mark a player as inactive and prevent them from gaining Battleground Marks and Honor Points.<br />
<br />
For information on how to do complete an AFK report, please see the “AFK Reporting” section here: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds/info.html (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/battlegrounds/info.html)<br />
<br />
Also, our In-Game Support Department is regularly checking for inactive players and they will be issuing disciplinary measures for those found violating our policies.<br />
<br />
Drysc also posted a few words of explanation about this.<br />
In any case it's something we've been looking to do for a little while now, and since it's a hotfixable change (not everything is), we hotfixed it.<br />
<br />
We do have some fairly substantial Alterac Valley changes coming in a future patch that we hope will address some of the balance and play issues.&lt;/annoyinglybutnecessarilyvague&gt; (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3773329652&amp;postId=37728709840&amp;sid=1#22))<br />
<br />
We want to fix the main issue.<br />
<br />
The main issue is not that people AFK, it's why they AFK.<br />
The main issue is not that some no longer queue, it's why they no longer queue.<br />
<br />
Asking to make the AFK or queuing system more robust (read: punishing) is really just band-aiding a band-aid and on and on. It will never stop, and we'll only reach a point of total agreement when no one is allowed to play.<br />
<br />
We're attempting to put in good, balanced, fun changes that fix these issues at their root.<br />
<br />
I'm being a bit hypocritical because the hotfix today did none of this, but it's certainly a positive change in the interim. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3773329652&amp;postId=37728710262&amp;sid=1#44))<br />

<br />
On the topic of GMs disciplining AFKers I have to say I have never heard of it happening and the widespread use suggests that if it is happening the disciplinary measures are not acting as any sort of deterrant. Has anyone heard of them actually following up on those reports?<br />
<br />
I can see how one of those conversations might go:<br />
<br />
&lt;GM&gt;Bgwatcher whispers: &quot;It has been brought to our attention that you have been afking in battlegrounds&quot;<br />
&lt;GM&gt;Bgwatcher whispers: &quot;Such actions are against our playing rules and if you persist disciplinary action will be taken&quot;<br />
&lt;GM&gt;Bgwatcher whispers: &quot;Is there anything else I can help you with?&quot;<br />
&lt;GM&gt;Bgwatcher whispers: &quot;Very well Pwnzalot, have a nice day&quot;<br />

You may wonder why Pwnzalot says nothing, well its because he isn't at his bloody keyboard for crying out loud, he is in bed asleep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for the report hotfix, it's very needed, but mostly in refrence to the other battlegrounds, in AV people will still just pop the insignia.<br />
<br />
And to fix the leeching, you'd need to fix the honor system on the whole...again...not AV.</div></div><hr />

just decrease the Honor needed for Items and u will have less AFKler or much better... Sell S1 and PvP Items for GOLD so People that realy want to play PvP can do it without AFKler</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has the right to ban anyone for any reason (or no reason), but banning accounts on a whim would set a bad precedent. Therefore Blizzard does not like to take action against players unless they are using detectable &quot;third party software&quot; to circumvent normal play. However, there are more crude (and undetectable) ways I can imagine to create an AFK bot. An old-timey drinking bird (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?action=post;topic=3322.0;num_replies=7) on a keyboard would suffice. <br />
<br />
The best solution would be for Blizzard to change the requisites for someone to be flagged as un-AFK by the server. Jumping and single, repetitive movements/actions at the least should not un-AFK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
From the terms of use they can punish any player for:<br />
<br />
<br />
Anything that Blizzard considers contrary to the &quot;essence&quot; of the Program<br />
<br />
That is their catchall for any disruptive gameplay and they can easily say they consider afk farming of honor violates that essence. If however you want to be more specific about not needing a reason at all further down in the terms of service you will find:<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard’s Absolute Right to Suspend, Terminate and/or Delete the Account.<br />
BLIZZARD MAY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY, OR DELETE THE ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME WITH ANY REASON OR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE. For purposes of explanation and not limitation, most account suspensions, terminations and/or deletions are the result of violations of this Terms of Use or the EULA.<br />
<br />
So you are wrong, they can indeed ban you without any reason or explanation at all, they just tend not to. <br />
<br />
As for general PvP, I wrote a long post about the problem on the PvP forums a while back, the basic problem accross pretty much all the BGs is that most of the time getting honor involves spending a lot of time doing things that involve no PvP whatsoever. That is why on pretty much all BGs half the people spend time doing the fun stuff, the typical mid battleground fight that ignores all objectives and the rest spend the time trying to win the BG. Until the fun stuff is also the stuff you need to do to win WoW BG PvP will remain a bit of a letdown. For the most part this means reducing the number of objectives in the BGs so that you actually need to be better at PvP to fight for those that are active. <br />
<br />
<br />
The main issue is not that people AFK, it's why they AFK.<br />
<br />
If it isn't obvious they AFK because the games broken honor system gives out most of the honor in BG wide bonuses and precious little honor for actually killing your opponents, you know, PvP. The fix is obvious, remove the objective rewards, only give honor for actually killing your enemies and make it so that winning the BG is something that will happen if your side is better at that than the enemies are. PvP should be about killing players not babysitting flags.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2008-01-05, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">as i said...

<br />
<br />
I think to a certain extent BGs did start a downward slide with the introduction of PvP rewards. I think the idea was that PvP would be better if they lured people who don't like to PvP into doing it just so they could get some reward items. Having people who want the rewards but don't care in the slightest about the PvP experience has resulted in much of the troubles the BGs have now.<br />
<br />
To be honest though most of the problems could be solved if Blizzard just reverse their unwillingness to police the BGs and that post seems to suggest that they are going to do that, because frankly until they start banning players for this sort of abuse it is of course going to continue and many players will choose to bot instead of work for the honor simply because there are no consequences for that choice. Those players for the most part are not evil or setting out to hassle others, they are making a practical assessment of how to do something they want i.e. &quot;get rewards&quot; without doing something they dislike i.e. &quot;hours and hours and hours of BGs&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Why?<br />
Pvp just isnt as fun anymore as it was at lvl60, doing the same god damn thing each day to slowly rank up your points, ofc people will leech.<br />
Im not saying that the old ranksystem was a whole lot better, but atleast it was better then it is now.<br />
People actually needed to play in order to achieve their goals.<br />
You wouldnt be able to rank up any higher then r3 by botting, so people actually had to play.<br />
<br />
Add s3 honorstuff to arena vendors, for lets say 600-1000 a piece and revamp the current state of pvp now, dont wait till wotlk.</div></div><hr />

Now im a boter myself, and I have been for over a year, ever since the new honor system went live.<br />
<br />
The final solution would be the only thing the bot can't do, but people playing easily can.<br />
On different websites (hotmail etc.) you have to enter a keykode that appears in a window to continue, so people can't make multiplied mails easily by bots etc.<br />
Implementing this in wow would be awesome. Let's say you click the battlemaster, you get up a picture with 3 letters/numbers, and a &quot;I would like to go to the battlegrounds&quot; button, when you press it, you will enter the battlegrounds list if you entered right code, and just a RP text from the battlemaster if you typed wrong code. Next time you speak with him it will be a different code etc etc.<br />
<br />
JUST A SUGGESTION LOL.<br />

<br />
I don't personally enjoy pvp all that much, but I do like to do it every now and then (with friends, for example) and when I do, I need pvp gear to be able to do it. And so, to get the honor without struggling each time through long and often losing battlegrounds, I afk.<br />
<br />
I think the problem is that battlegrounds aren't fun for a lot of people, and if they were fun, people would actually play them for honor. There's always going to be people trying to work around the system, though, and trying to get rewards for as little effort as possible.</div></div><hr />
