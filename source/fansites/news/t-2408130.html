In-Game Group Finder Advertising Policy Changes<br />
Keep in mind that Patch 8.0 will also remove the ability of addons to create Group Finder groups (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7718-Battle-for-Azeroth-World-Quest-UI-Changes-Tweets-FinalBossTV-Paladins-DLC-637).<br />
As part of our ongoing efforts to crack down on in-game advertising, we’ll be implementing some policy changes with how we handle moderation for advertisements made through the in-game Group Finder, and wanted to give you a heads up before these policies are put into place.<br />
<br />
Beginning Monday, July 2nd, we will no longer allow any advertisements in the Group Finder for in-game services such as carries or boosts, including those being offered in exchange for in-game gold. The Group Finder is intended for -- as the name suggests -- finding groups, and these advertisements make it difficult to find active groups that are currently being formed. Additionally, these are often used as a cover for real-money sales, particularly given that in-game gold cannot be transferred cross-realm.<br />
<br />
Note that this does not change our policy on selling things such as raid carries for in-game gold. Those are still allowed, but should be advertised through realm-specific methods such as trade chat.<br />
<br />
We’ll be adding an “advertisement” option to the Group Finder’s right-click reporting function with Patch 8.0, but in the meantime, they can be reported using the “spam” option. Thank you for your understanding, and for helping us keep the Group Finder clear of unwanted advertisements.<br />

<br />
It makes it harder to find a group in the sense that you have to scroll through several &quot;carries for gold&quot; groups. It's more of an annoyance than anything else. It will be a quality of life improvement for everyone once it's fully implemented. No more cluttering in the regular tab for those that want to find a group, and those interested in a carry will be able to browse an entire Advertisement tab just for it.</div></div><hr />

How is a website advertising worse than a streamer? Unless you mean people specifically spamming for cash only runs and those were already not allowed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because you're only thinking about your thing. What you're failing to account for is the other nine guys also clogging up the LFG tool with that crap at the same time as you advertising. It's not about one guy. It's about mass amounts of people.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RoKPaNda</div><div class="date">2018-07-02, 07:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is a website advertising worse than a streamer?

<br />
I didn't say anything about streamers. I don't care about streamers. Yes, selling runs for gold was already not allowed and those should be removed from the group finder. Usually that's what the boost groups with a url at the end are. Sales for gold. Those, being against the rules, should definitely be removed from the group finder. Gold sales being removed from the group finder is pretty silly though. Given that gold sales aren't against the rules they could at least put a separate section for them in the group finder. All they're going to accomplish here is even more trade chat spam. <br />
<br />
<br />
They were ok, now they are not.<br />
<br />
Cross realm gold boosts are still within the rules, actually. Only real money sales are not. Given that cross realm gold boosts aren't breaking any rules there is no reason they shouldn't be advertised in the group finder. This is just going to create more spam in different places instead of the group finder. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard was at all motivated they could just add a gold sales section to the group finder or better yet they could just leave it alone but be more diligent about their removing of real currency boost ads. It all comes down to laziness.</div></div><hr />

Gold boost is within the rules. Spam is not. You're allowed to use /2 to sell your boost services (or other in-game items or services). You're not allowed to use /w, /4, /raid, LFG and other means of in-game communicating to sell your boost services (or other in-game items or services). Simple as that. Those, who read /2 channel, are interesting in buying something. Most of those, who use LFG tool, are not interested in buying boosts.</div></div><hr />

I'd imagine those with more gold than skill are a bit ticked as well since now they need to worry about people dropping groups mid run because the guy/gal with the key cant hold his/her own or he/she cant join someone elses key group because his/her raider I.O. score is too low.</div></div><hr />

And you're being completely dense if you don't realize that this is NOT dis-allowing a person from making toons on multiple servers and advertising in those different trade channels.

Good luck spamming trade chat on a trial account. Tell me how it goes. There is plenty of trade chat spam for carries anyway so you not being able to clog up the LFG tool with bullshit isn't going to make people unable to find carries lol</div></div><hr />

Well either you sell boosts for cash and are admitting that or you don't realize tokens cant be turned into cash. Either way, I'll take the removal of your lfg spam AND cause you to waste a bunch of money. Win-win for me and for Blizzard lol</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smoe</div><div class="date">2018-07-02, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone who has taken part in carry runs I feel kind of sad about this change. Carry runs make up a good portion of income for mythic raiding guilds that in turn use the income to buy mats for raiding. With the current changes, guilds will neither be able to advertise in LFG or in trade/general for fear of being reported and subsequently banned. This will hurt the guilds with people who don't have enough time to spend in game to farm mats on their own. With that source of income gone, they'll either have to drop out of their raid team or find another time efficient way to make enough gold for mats.<br />
<br />
Moreover this hurts the carries themselves. Many of them are the auction tycoons who support raiders form the background by farming and selling those mats at a cheap price. In return, they're able to use the gold they made to purchase whatever mounts/achieves they want from the mythic guilds selling carries. This was the majority of their gold outlet so it will be interesting to see if those people will continue chasing after gold cap or if they'll follow everyone else and try their hand at raiding. If that's the case then the price of mats will definitely increase as the main group that drove the price down are now gone. <br />
<br />
I know I'm a minority in this, but that's my personal opinion on the matter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree that the LFG spam needs to go, advertising your services in trade chat is EXACTLY what trade chat was made for. Unlike what many seem to think, trade chat is for buying and selling goods and services (for ingame gold of course), so selling carries and advertising in trade chat is exactly how it should work. If you dont want to see people selling stuff in trade chat, I'd suggest leaving it.<br />
<br />
After all trade chat was made for trading, not arguing about politics with people that wont change their mind anyway or spamming anal jokes.</div></div><hr />

But you actually believe people don't advertise in trade chat? Maybe your server is dead then. The 4 servers I've played on have all had many guilds selling their services for over 3 expansions. I personally have benefitted greatly from selling carries for gold as far back as cataclysm without ever using the LFG tool to advertise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guilds have been using trade chat for sell runs for several expansions and they still do even with LFG if they're smart. The change is just going to bring it back to normal and have LFG be for looking for groups not buyers. Trade chat will and should be used for people buying and selling their goods and services.

Rhetorical question, their reasoning is poor. Also you can just not use the group finder, same logic. Realistically though the handful of gold boosts are very easy to skip over. It's the &quot;HAY GO TO OUR URL LOL GIVE US MONEY.&quot; ads that take up all the space. <br />

All if this is within the rules.Buying a token doesn't work that way. You pay $20 USD for a token and put it on the AH. When it gets to the front of the line, it sells and you get the gold. Since you cannot trade in-game gold cross-realm, you have NO IDEA when your token is going to get to the front of the line.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I, the booster, am on server A, with my 3 friends.<br />
You, the buyer, are on server B, wanting a boost.<br />
I create a lvl 1 toon on your server, you give me the gold price of a token (let’s say 400k for simplicity’s sake).<br />
I then buy a token with that gold on your server, giving me the value of a token in bnet balance (not sure how much you actually get tbh)<br />
I would then pay my 3 friends on my own server with gold from my own pocket to compensate them for me getting the token value in bnet balance (so 100k to each of them, so I end up with -300k gold but 1 token of bnet balance, they end up with +100k). I assume you get the same value on your bnet balance as it costs to buy a token, so I could potentially then buy myself another token with said balance and get 400k gold for it, netting me +100k gold too on my own server.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps!</div></div><hr />

You pay $20 USD for a token and put it on the AH. When it gets to the front of the line, it sells and you get the gold. Since you cannot trade in-game gold cross-realm, you have NO IDEA when your token is going to get to the front of the line.<br />

During the free weekend in WoW, I came back to WoW for the weekend and bought a heroic Argus kill for gold (the mount was too tempting). I found the group through group finder. The way it worked was like this:<br />
<br />
the guild was based on illidan, but had a network of alts on all different server. 1/2 hour before the raid started, we were told to go to the lv1 starting area. The raid leader told us the name of the alt on our local servers we had to pay the gold to, and someone from the guild logged on to their alts on each of our servers and collected the gold. After payment we got summoned to Argus and got our kills/mounts. It was a very refined and painless experience.<br />
<br />
I assume that once they get enough gold on each alt, they use it to buy tokens or transfer it via pets or some other method. That really is/was none of my concern though.</div></div><hr />

It's stupid, in my mind, there rewards are for show, to show that you have (or in my case, had) some skill. My black horse from Grand Crusader (Wotlk Colosseum immortal first server) is for that kind of purpose :) If you don't get them the regular way, you don't DESERVE them...<br />
<br />
I tend to forget all the mounts I get for easy HF but I still use this and the Zul Gurub (original !) bear and that black horse everyday.<br />
<br />
Not everything should be accessible for everyone, anytime. Specifically mounts.</div></div><hr />

Yeah exactly, If Illidan would be lightforged he would loose all demonic/fel traits, so no horns or hooves anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Step 1 : Buy High Value Battle Pet<br />
Step 2 : Learn Said Battle Pet<br />
Step 3 : Log-on to Main Server<br />
Step 4 : Cage Battle Pet and Sale on AH<br />
<br />
True but its not guaranteed at all that someone will buy your overpriced pet. There are 1M golds pet on my realm AH for litterally weeks, same price same vendor<br />
<br />
I collect pets but I'll never buy a pet for more than 20K<br />

Now just get rid of the fucking lagging, cheating, premade BG making russian teams and were GOOD BLIZZ<br />
<br />
Yeah I dont know why europeans must play with Russians on EU servers. These people don't even try to speak something everyone can understand and I've lost every single BG with a &quot;almost only Russian team&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're wrong. Groups that list a URL are sold for cash, those should be removed. The vast majority of ads are gold only and accept gold on any realm and say as such in the ad. <br />
<br />
I think a lot of people vastly overestimate the ease of getting characters setup on multiple realms to accept gold and run boosts. It's very little effort for a lot of reward. All it takes is 930~ to faceroll a +15, and all it takes is a day or so at 110 to get 930+ and then it's like having a license to print money.</div></div><hr />

Every advertisement should be removed. I have nights that I would love to do some runs seeing that the vast majority are boosters are streamers. I am glad they finally take action. And the ban of trade will eventually follow since the spam currently is also getting out of control.</div></div><hr />

I'm happy that you think so but boost runs have been sold in large numbers and advertised in trade chat for at least the last decade so don't hold your breath lol.</div></div><hr />

I've been on both ends of this - both selling, and now buying. If I was playing during legion, I'd get it normally - after all, heroic is pretty easy and beating it not all that much to be proud of - but if all I have is one weekend, and main who has an 860-ish ilv with 14 million AP total (and neither argus or broken shore open), then there simply isn't the time (by the end of the weekend I barely had enough ilv to get into argus LFR). In all, I think it's a win-win for everyone. The group gets gold they need to continue raiding, and I get a mount my character will look great on if they manage to turn the game direction around after they inevitably fire Hazzicostas.</div></div><hr />

Go all the way. Turalyon, Liadrin and the host of the Silver Hand all kneel before him and his amazing ability to wield the light. He announces he will teach them all how to be great light users and they humbly submit to his teachings. Cut scene Illidan standing in the paladin order hall gazing heroically while behind him, all statues of paladins have been replaced with statues of Illidan in various poses. Tyrande clings to his holy arm in glee. Together forever.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, I was hoping it would be creepier. Given what we know about alt Draenor after we leave, I would love to see the alternate universe Xera would have created with lightforged Illidan. Seeing him punch through some random demons was a little disappointing, to be honest. Seeing the surprise on Turalyon's face, I kind of hoped it was fear in his eyes. &quot;What have I done?&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah well, it's just a short video he made for fun; I shouldn't expect quite that much from it. :p I just really liked his Silithus video and was hoping this would be on the same level.</div></div><hr />
