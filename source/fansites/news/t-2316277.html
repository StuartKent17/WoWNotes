Pretty sure it’s a sample. But I doubt WoW has 5mio active subs atm. My guesstimate would be around 3 mio?</div></div><hr />

Its probably list of known characters that can't possibly cover all players. Looks like out of those &quot;active&quot; players only 60% are actually playing, why the rest are marked as active is mystery.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even during Catas peak these surveys only picked up like 3m players for EU and NA so there are probably 4-7m subs depending on Asia subs. <br />
<br />
<br />
Prob 2-3m actual western subs for WoW and another 2-4m in Asian territory's.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Armory stats during the first 6months of SoO showed 2.3m players, so even if thats accurate we only lost around 500k in the last 4 years. Id guess about 5.5m subs worldwide atm.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, same with me. I resubbed when 7.3 came out, I was excited to come back to WoW but then... a week later... I found myself grinding new currencies and killing demons the entire time. Login, do the dailies, kills rares, collect 910 gear, logout. Not to mention that Argus is a shithole, I hate it. I tried hard to like the new patch but 3 weeks later I just bailed out and let the sub expire. I moved to another MMO with no sub and a LOT less grind. I forgot how cool is to start from scratch in a new world. I miss Azeroth (the memories...) but I don't miss its mechanics at all. If it wasn't for Blizzard and their incredible hype-marketing I am sure I would have abandoned WoW a long time ago.</div></div><hr />

Not really. Appear Offline is for bnet friends only. Presumably Krom is raiding with a guild, and appear offline doesn't hide you from guild list, or even WoW friend list. It doesn't even prevent people from cross server whispering you. So there is realistically no way that you can raid dodge while appearing offline and still do things in WoW without anyone knowing. The comic pretty much shows something that can't happen with the new system, and isn't relatable at all.</div></div><hr />

Nope. I got it because I'm going there and instead of each of my friends having to buy it they can come to my house while I'm gone and set my PC up on my TV to watch it.<br />

They aren't too fussed about the virtual goodies either. And considering how much they do for me they deserve it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrLoque</div><div class="date">2017-10-09, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of curiosity, which mmo did you move to?<br />
Guild Wars 2, which I knew by name but I always mocked as &quot;wow surrogate which will never be as good as my beloved Blizzard mmo&quot;.<br />
<br />
I casually found a Reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/72t62o/guild_wars_2s_mount_animations_have_some_serious/) about GW2 mounts and fell in love with it. I then decided to be a little more oben minded, go deeper, read some comments and finally installed the free client. One days later I purchased the base game and expansions (49€ bundle). This gives you an idea of how much it hit me :-). <br />
<br />
Main differences with WoW:<br />
<br />
<br />
world exploration is meaningful (and fun)<br />
no class trifecta (tank, healer, dps)<br />
combat is engaging and fun even when you kill a rabbit (I'm dead serious!)<br />
level-scaling content everywhere with loot/rewards that adapt to your real level (a level 50 running level 10 content will be lowered to level 11 but still get level 50 loot)<br />
extremely rewarding and fun to play, each level gain, login, discovery... gives you something (loot, experience, points, etc)<br />
lots of classes/races to play with with almost no restrictions<br />
alt-friendly<br />
great AH (called Trading Post) that can be used everywhere on the field<br />
mats can be dropped to your bank from anywhere with a simple click<br />
lots of QoL features<br />
extremely cool and helpful community, people will support/revive you while playing and give hints/help even when not asked<br />
no gear outleveling and no power creep<br />
gold has a real value (rich players have few hundreds, VERY rich players hoard few thousands).<br />
great-to-amazing graphics (if you can handle ultra + filters)<br />
<br />
<br />
After 10+ years in WoW I can't deny GW2 seriously changed my mmo life, that's it. I could once again feel the thrill of leveling, exploring, looting, killing, etc. It's not a perfect MMO of course, it will not please everyone... But coming from WoW I find it amazingly fun and engaging. This is the first time I feel the desire to level alts, for example. Exploring the world is fun (secrets, mini-bosses, mini-games, ...), level-scaling adds a lot of replayability to every zone, etc.</div></div><hr />

Unless he made a new char that is on noones friendlist and not part of the guild. In which case they would only see him via his battle.net tag which is set to offline.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoce6bdc70fdc</div><div class="date">2017-10-09, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So there is only 1,8m active subs ~ ? I thought we were back to 5-6m currently. :(<br />
<br />
EU and US presumably means that Asian players are not included in this equation. There could be anywhere between 1-3 million of them. We also don't know if these 1.8 millions active players are the only active players, as far as I know. And even then it presumably only counts qualified players. I.E. someone who's spent an hour a day leveling a new character wouldn't be counted.<br />

It's hard to see exactly how many active players there are. Given how prominently featured WoW is at Blizzcon this year, I'd assume Blizzard have deemed it active enough to continue supporting it. The WoW-tokens probably made the game extremely lucrative.</div></div><hr />

The main point of being &quot;invisible&quot; should be... playing whatever toon you want without being visibile to anyone. That's currently impossible unless you play an alt with no friends. I find it mostly useless apart from very specific situations.</div></div><hr />

You got one? Not everyone is laughing at the obvious point. THe funny part of that comic is that the stupid dude is asking where Krom is and Krom is now relaxing. If thats how the feature works or not, who cares. Its just a comic.<br />

Which isn't fun... Because everyone would know that Krom is relaxing. That's the point. The offline mode doesn't hide you from friends/guildies (unless you're playing an alt with no friends, which is not the case of Krom). It would be fun if it was something that reflects an ingame feature. This is not the case.</div></div><hr />

Nah I get that you don't think so, but I think the actual comic is fun, and others do as well(and appearantly people think its not fun as well) If you know the other DLC comics, you know how their relationship. And that is funny.<br />
<br />
Whats also funny is that other in his guild is in ToS, and he is not. Maybe he is on an alt not in guild? Does it make more sense now?</div></div><hr />

I know DLC comics since #1, yes. Can you please explain me where is the fun aspect of this specific comic, which addresses a new wow feature which is not currently &quot;real&quot;? It makes fun of a specific aspect that doesn't exist. I don't get the fun, honestly. <br />
<br />
The fun part -in theory- would be that Krom is happy to be doing something simple (fishing) instead of raiding... while others are think he's offline. &quot;He's not online so he must be doing something in real life&quot; but he actually is ingame on fishing and relaxing &quot;hahahah!&quot;.<br />

&quot;One could argue&quot; completely deviates from the original intent of this comic. A comic stripe has a specific objective, it doesn't need to be argued or understood.

If you know DLC comics you know Krom is a well-known toon with lots of friends. It's not a generic alt. This comic clearly shows the friends panel with a huge &quot;offline&quot; label for your raiding friends. It makes sure that you see Krom being idle while his friends are in a raid. The entire point of the stripe is to make fun of the offline option, which hides you from friends/guildmates and lets you fish without worrying about your them. It even says &quot;bliss&quot; to underline the happiness of being invisible/anonymous to your friends and be free to do silly stuff. Which-is-wrong because it doesn't work like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I casually found a Reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/72t62o/guild_wars_2s_mount_animations_have_some_serious/) about GW2 mounts and fell in love with it. I then decided to be a little more oben minded, go deeper, read some comments and finally installed the free client. One days later I purchased the base game and expansions (49€ bundle). This gives you an idea of how much it hit me :-). <br />
<br />
Main differences with WoW:<br />
<br />
<br />
world exploration is meaningful (and fun)<br />
no class trifecta (tank, healer, dps)<br />
combat is engaging and fun even when you kill a rabbit (I'm dead serious!)<br />
level-scaling content everywhere with loot/rewards that adapt to your real level (a level 50 running level 10 content will be lowered to level 11 but still get level 50 loot)<br />
extremely rewarding and fun to play, each level gain, login, discovery... gives you something (loot, experience, points, etc)<br />
lots of classes/races to play with with almost no restrictions<br />
alt-friendly<br />
great AH (called Trading Post) that can be used everywhere on the field<br />
mats can be dropped to your bank from anywhere with a simple click<br />
lots of QoL features<br />
extremely cool and helpful community, people will support/revive you while playing and give hints/help even when not asked<br />
no gear outleveling and no power creep<br />
gold has a real value (rich players have few hundreds, VERY rich players hoard few thousands).<br />
great-to-amazing graphics (if you can handle ultra + filters)<br />
<br />
<br />
After 10+ years in WoW I can't deny GW2 seriously changed my mmo life, that's it. I could once again feel the thrill of leveling, exploring, looting, killing, etc. It's not a perfect MMO of course, it will not please everyone... But coming from WoW I find it amazingly fun and engaging. This is the first time I feel the desire to level alts, for example. Exploring the world is fun (secrets, mini-bosses, mini-games, ...), level-scaling adds a lot of replayability to every zone, etc.<br />
<br />
I've always felt that GW2 is just outright better than most MMOs, in terms of graphics and mechanics both. The main point that most people seem to have about it is in the nature of the content. Because despite it's superior design, GW2 is not WoW. It doesn't have the same themes, or feeling, or graphics. Add to that an unhealthy dose of investment in their WoW characters, and it's not surprising that so many people don't bother to look closely enough at GW2 to really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
I think it's great that you took the time to actually check it out and see for yourself the differences!</div></div><hr />

&quot;One could argue&quot; that what I think is fun is not what you think is fun. Its a comic wich shows a scenario about offline mode. Last time it was about velen and illidan imitating peoples whining. I tought it was hilarious, but illidan and velen doesn't really do that ingame now do they? Its a comic. How you see it can be entirely different from everybody else.</div></div><hr />

Actually they not stating it, at least not here..they say &quot;This data comes from 1.8 million US and EU players active in the last month. &quot; which can be a part of all of them or actually every active in the last month. Maybe somewhere they explain how the samples ongoing but right here you can`t be sure</div></div><hr />

I gave it an honest to god try. I really enjoyed GW but GW2 just deviated from everything I enjoy in an MMO. Role diversity, gear meaning a lot for character progression, raids, etc. The dungeons were just not enjoyable with the hot potato aggro for me and all that. But I tried, and I can see how people like it, it's just not my cup of tea for an MMO, maybe if I had come into thinking full single player:confused:</div></div><hr />

I can totally relate to this. My MMO world was Azeroth and nothing else. I never considered any alternative because... &quot;nope&quot;. But when I realized that WoW -for me- was 90% nostalgia and 10% &quot;fun&quot; I put an end to the grind and moved to something different.

The thing is that the rep achievements, 2000 demon achievement, and Commander of Argus are all ones that get completed eventually (Commander may take a little additional effort but not much).<br />

But I tried, and I can see how people like it, it's just not my cup of tea for an MMO, maybe if I had come into thinking full single player:confused:There is still some tanking and pure-DPS difference (Warriors aren't great DPS machines, Rangers are great) but the way mobs react to players is different. They don't focus on a single player who keeps the aggro all the time: mob's aggro moves from player to player based on other factors. Which can be &quot;controlled&quot; and &quot;managed&quot;. It's different and I think it's good because it allows everyone to play the desired class. <br />
<br />
Playing WoW as a Hunter (random pure-DPS class) means you will almost never-ever care about aggroing the enemy. Unless you're blind or completely AFK... You can't die. You just spam your attacks and avoid the occasional mechanic. Period. This is not the case of GW2, where you need to manage your damage and be aware of the situation. I agree that dungeons (and world bosses) can be messy but that's not different from WoW: any world boss or rare is a meatball of players who desperately try to tag it before it dies so they can grab some loot and some currency. Mythics are a different story but they're just a fraction of the game.<br />
<br />
What really differentiates the two games is... combat. In WoW you &quot;tag&quot; the enemy and that's it: cycle your skills until it dies. If you run away you will get hit anyway, unless you put yourself behind a (huge) obstacle. If you run through a pack of enemies you get hit even if they're 50 yards away. On the other side, GW2 fights are more &quot;engaging&quot; because you can dodge (hits, spells, ...), switch weapons/skills while in combat and drastically change the course of a fight by taking advantage of terrain, distance and personal skill. There is a lot more than spamming some buttons, in my opinion. And the world itself is more &quot;alive&quot; and &quot;convincing&quot; than any area in WoW: there are lots of things happening all the time, no &quot;bring me 10 snouts&quot; quests repeated 1000 times. While you level you can naturally move from zone to zone while following the flow of events and enjoy the story/lore in a more &quot;natural&quot; way in my opinion. That doesn't mean that GW2 offers infinite variety, of course. Some stuff is repetitive sometimes but far less than WoW.<br />
<br />
It's different but in a good way. Coming from 10+ years in WoW I needed some time to learn, adapt an &quot;forget&quot; the old habits. WoW is a big boss, it's not easy to ditch it and move to something new :)</div></div><hr />

It's definitely a change of pace. GW2 is MUCH more heavily based on player skill and build than your standard MMO. Something like WoW is 90% gear, where GW2 is more 50/50. You can REALLY tell the difference between a good player and an average one, both in PVP and PVE. <br />
<br />
Although I've heard it's a bit worse in those terms these days. Supposedly it's more gear heavy now. <br />
<br />

<br />
I think this probably describes a LOT of WoW players: Playing because it's just what they've always done, not because it's actually any better than anything else out there. I mean, how many times have you heard people saying they can't actually explain why they log in? Or how people have talked about WoW just becoming a habit? There's nothing intrinsically wrong with those kinds of feelings, but I do think it limits people's ability to be open to other ways of doing things. <br />
<br />
In a lot of ways it's like traveling. Explaining to someone who never leaves their home town what it's like to visit so many different and diverse places just won't make sense to them. They don't have the context.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrLoque</div><div class="date">2017-10-09, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's definitely a change of pace.

<br />
Skills and builds have a LOT more variety based on how you want to play. WoW gives you few &quot;fixed&quot; builds and almost no room to experiment. Even if you do so... the gameplay will be the same. A GW2 Warrior can use swords, axes, 2h swords, 2h axes, maces, 2h maces, guns, bows, ... Each one with its skills/features. You can hit the enemy with a sword, roll to avoid its attack, jump back and switch to your gun at the same time, hit the mob, roll again to avoid a spell attack, switch to back to your sword and charge to stun. Equip a mace and the gameplay changes completely. You're not tied to a specific build, the amount of customization (at no cost) is impressive. Of course there will always be a &quot;signature&quot; build for specific situations -in theory- but without a DPS meter and without a tank/dps/healer trifecta you really feel part of the group every single time.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
So true and -once again- this is exactly how I felt for the past WoW years. You grow some kind of attachment to it: toons, lore, graphics... Everything &quot;makes sense&quot; to your eyes, even the horribly outdated engine (the leveling experience is a kick in the balls). When you approach a new game with a new engine you feel... lost. It really makes you feel bad, it's like &quot;cheating&quot; in some way. Things look and feel different. <br />
<br />
Then you realize that &quot;different&quot; doesn't mean &quot;bad&quot; but you need to be open minded and let the experience flow through you. If you want to feel that thrill you felt in WoW 10 years ago... You can't approach another MMO while still thinking about WoW. You need to &quot;remove&quot; it from your mind and be ready to learn something new.<br />
<br />
So I did and it worked damn fine. I now can't wait to go back home and burn my eyes in that awesome world :)</div></div><hr />

Well that's a valid point, but the only thing better then getting a mount is getting it early enough to show off that you have it when half of everyone still don't know its a thing :D</div></div><hr />

GW2 is MUCH more heavily based on player skill and build than your standard MMO. Something like WoW is 90% gear, where GW2 is more 50/50. You can REALLY tell the difference between a good player and an average one, both in PVP and PVE. <br />
<br />
Although I've heard it's a bit worse in those terms these days. Supposedly it's more gear heavy now. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this probably describes a LOT of WoW players: Playing because it's just what they've always done, not because it's actually any better than anything else out there. I mean, how many times have you heard people saying they can't actually explain why they log in? Or how people have talked about WoW just becoming a habit? There's nothing intrinsically wrong with those kinds of feelings, but I do think it limits people's ability to be open to other ways of doing things. <br />
<br />
In a lot of ways it's like traveling. Explaining to someone who never leaves their home town what it's like to visit so many different and diverse places just won't make sense to them. They don't have the context.<br />
<br />
A lot of players do get stuck, I may not like gw2 but I do play a decent amount of mmos, just that they have what I like, gear, raiding, the holy trinity, all that. I like variety but still have needs that a game has to meet</div></div><hr />

Yeah, no one is to say whats fun or not for me, so when someone comes and tell me I am wrong about MY kind of humour, then yes, I will use sarcasm as a tool. And this was with another player. You came in, tried to look like a fun dude, and yes, you failed miserably. After that you have come with 3 insults, one way way over the line. You should have stopped at the basement comment, wich was indeed hilarious. Now its just silly. All this because I wrote I tought something was funny. But I guess its no use to even comment because some random dude tells me I am wrong for no appearent reason.</div></div><hr />

You should feel ashamed of what you just said. This is a videogame forum and we're talking about videogames. I hope you will have the decency to apologize to everyone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jester Joe</div><div class="date">2017-10-09, 06:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really. Appear Offline is for bnet friends only. Presumably Krom is raiding with a guild, and appear offline doesn't hide you from guild list, or even WoW friend list. It doesn't even prevent people from cross server whispering you. So there is realistically no way that you can raid dodge while appearing offline and still do things in WoW without anyone knowing. The comic pretty much shows something that can't happen with the new system, and isn't relatable at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which isn't fun... Because everyone would know that Krom is relaxing. That's the point. The offline mode doesn't hide you from friends/guildies (unless you're playing an alt with no friends, which is not the case of Krom). It would be fun if it was something that reflects an ingame feature. This is not the case.<br />
<br />
DLC has always drawn characters alts to look the same as the character themselves.<br />

Come on let's go down the rabbit hole!<br />
<br />
This DLC shows the following things:<br />
<br />
1. A toon called Krom, be it a main or an alt (it doesn't matter)<br />
2. Krom's friends list who are raiding (so he has friends, he's not a &quot;fresh&quot; alt)<br />
3. Krom's status set to &quot;offline&quot;<br />
4. Krom &quot;happy&quot; to be invisible and free to go fishing instead of raiding<br />
<br />
Which implie that:<br />
<br />
a. Krom thinks he's invisible to his raiding friends<br />
b. Krom's raiding friends can't see him and don't suspect he's online<br />
<br />
But we also know that...:<br />
<br />
I. &quot;Offline mode&quot; doesn't hide Krom from his friends/guildies<br />
II. Everyone knows Krom is online<br />
III. Krom is happy about something that makes no sense<br />
<br />
Call me dumb but I don't see the &quot;fun factor&quot; in this comic :). To each its own!</div></div><hr />

Krom is the battletag, not the actual character name in this case. Hence, it's in the battletag location on the menu. Makes sense to keep the battletag the same as the character's name in the comic, otherwise we'd have no way to telling and it would kill the joke.<br />
<br />
Clearly, he is invisible to his friends, since one even has it as their status &quot;where's Krom&quot;. Also, not sure where you're getting &quot;Krom's friends list who are raiding (so he has friends, he's not a &quot;fresh&quot; alt)&quot; from, since yet again, battletag. I could go make a level 1 horde toon while my alliance guild is raiding and I'll still see them raiding on my friends list.<br />
<br />
And whether or not it's an alt does matter, since if said alt wasn't in the guild, they wouldn't know he was on at all. Either way, even if it's a main, this sounds as nitpicky as going &quot;It's not funny when DLC has comics that have Velen and Illidan talking about simming dps&quot;</div></div><hr />

You say its getting to deep for a silly comic right? That's the thing with it, its a surface level comic, trying to cash in on the &quot;offline relax no more pesky guildies mode&quot; reaction when its not that simple for WoW. For the comic to make any sense, you'd have to understand the only way of doing this is to be on an alt that you've never been on before, otherwise people would know its you. You said it yourself, you have to think about the comic and make reasons for it to make sense, which is too silly to do for the comic. <br />
<br />
So you can agree the aim of the comic was to get people on board with the whole appear offline being useful etc, when in reality for WoW is it isn't at all. For it to be remotely useful, you'd need to never log in that toon while appearing online... not to mention the sites out there that find and lists alts based on armory data. Appear offline isn't useful to raid dodge and the comic doesn't make sense unless you go around making excuses for it. And then when people make excuses that go against it, makes it too deep for ya... yeah...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmmm ok so let's recap:<br />
<br />
1. the friends list shown in the comic is the player's battle.net list<br />
2. the player is offline on battle.net (nobody sees him)<br />
3. the player is ingame with an alt that has no ingame friends (nobody sees him)<br />
<br />
So the player &quot;Krom&quot; is offline outside WoW and is currently playing an alt with no friends so he can stay invisible/anonymous.<br />
<br />
Correct? It makes sense. But damn it took mre some time to get it.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Appear offline isn't useful to raid dodge<br />
<br />
In this specific case Krom (player's Battletag) logged into Battle.Net while offline. Nobody knows hes' actually online. He then plays a random alt with no friends and goes fishing. This specific scenario... works fine. But it seems way too specific/annoying to be useful: &quot;Let's go offline and play a randon anonymous alt with no friends so my guild and real friends don't know I'm here&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure MMO-C has never done one of these graphs based on the entirety of active accounts, notice at the top it says &quot;data sample&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes but you're giving too much value to the word 'sample'. This is a sample of the overall playerbase of the two regions, of which they took a 'sample' which involved the active max-level characters. 1.8M total for both regions is terrible. EU normally has more players than NA so that means NA is very likely under 1M active max-level accounts. As much as I'd like to hope failing subscribers would change Blizzard's design goals and we'd get a great MMO, it won't happen. The more likely outcome will be that they'll simply stop trying to make a good MMO and we'll just continue with the mediocre (or worse) status we've generally had for awhile. I'm in the process of quitting raiding (at least) myself although it's more for the amount of work I have to do. Personally, I'm still bummed they broke mods. The creativity and complexity in this game is pretty much gone as well and it feels like everything has become a mechanical process.</div></div><hr />
