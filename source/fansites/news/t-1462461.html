Character Viewer Updated: Female Dwarf!<br />
You can see the previously released models here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3782-Artcraft-Daughter-of-Draenor-New-Orc-Female-Model). The character viewer update also added icons for the Blood Elf and Draenei models.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/thumb/image-1-full.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/image-1-full.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/thumb/image-2-full.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/image-2-full.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/thumb/image-3-full.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/february/image-3-full.jpg) <br />
<br />
We’ve updated the model viewer on our website (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/#characters) with a look at one of the revised characters you’ll see in Azeroth and beyond with Warlords of Draenor (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/). Meet the new and improved female Dwarf (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/#characters).<br />
<br />
It was a challenge for our character artists to find a balance between the classic female dwarf model and the expressiveness of her fluid new animations, but we think the updated model says “descended from unyielding stone” as much as “griffon-riding, ale-swilling, loud-living hero.”<br />
<br />
We’ll continue to unearth more of Draenor and the shiny visuals coming to World of Warcraft around the release of Warlords (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/). Keep your magnifiers and spectacles ready!<br />
<br />
<br />
New Orc Model Skin Colors<br />
A few people were excited by the wording of the new Orc Female model post yesterday, so Bashiok made it clear that players won't have access to brown skins at this time.<br />
oh wait, green and brown-skinned, long-tusked heroine.<br />
This is in reference to the brown skinned Orcs of Draenor, who will be using the new updated models as well of course.<br />
<br />
We know there are a lot of requests for additional features and options, but as stated in this article &quot;we made the decision early on to stay focused on improving what already exists in-game, and making sure we really nail it.<br />
<br />
That said, we’ve also read your great ideas and feedback about features that you’d like to see as character customization options. Your collective voice matters to us, and we’d love to bring some of the coolest ideas to life someday if we can.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
New Orc Female Model Feedback<br />
Can we please get rid of the corn row buzz cut thing? I would think my orc would know how to keep parts of her head clean shaven she has been keeping it clean shaven for years.<br />
They're actually shaved lines, not braids. In some of the shots you can see they're not exact and not symmetrical, and that's intentional. Chris tweeted some backstory, and the intent is to give a bit more of a savage-warrior type vibe.<br />
<br />
https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/436222244587466752<br />
<br />
I painted in some shaved lines, like she shaves that area of her head with her axe as a sign of her kills. as an example of where we're making small adj. to give characters more depth without (hopefully) deviating too much (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/295325-female-orc-corn-row-weirdness/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11764546928?page=2#22))<br />
<br />
Looks good, only quibble is the tusks, seem too thin. In the kiss pose they look like little mustachios<br />
We're actually animating those for more range of motion with the face, so they're scaled down in that pose, not all the time. (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/436220110169067520))<br />

<br />
as blizzard has said before they are updating all the models at the same time. <br />
<br />
just because a model is played less or more doesnt effect how soon it gets done. art doesnt work like that. <br />
<br />
they arent going one by one they are doing all of them all the time all at once. <br />
<br />
male human is like the most played race. well maybe they are having problems figuring out how to nail the human. maybe something happened internally, perhaps the main human guy lacked a bit of inspiration one day and that slowed down his work a bit. <br />
<br />
you cant shove art on a conveyor belt and just smash it out. thats not how art works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no. the only models confirmed for launch are the finished ones. <br />
<br />
male dwarf<br />
female dwarf<br />
male gnome<br />
male orc<br />
<br />
all other models are unfinished. they are not promised to be at launch.</div></div><hr />

Love the fem Orc and male dwarf, hate the nose on the fem human, totally different than the in game model. <br />

<br />
She was absolutely stunning at that time. I fell out of my desk chair when I saw her. I love female Dwarves to no end, and I was thrilled... but this....what is this?<br />
<br />
Why would you pick that face, etc, for female dwarf's official representation, Blizzard? Even the 3D model on the website doesn't look much better.<br />
<br />
And they shrank her boobs again, and her butt. Why? If Pandaren women can be big and fluffy, why can't our female dwarves?<br />
<br />
So very disappointed.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have already stated all vanilla models would be available at launch, there's a blue on it, then they also added a new blue stating they were far enough along with model progress to get draenei/blood elves in time for launch too. Go search yourself if you don't believe it...but yeah, they will all be there updated aside from worgen/goblin which really doesn't desperately need the updates anyway.</div></div><hr />

Thank you for the lesson in how art works....? Im just saying, who is in charge there? &quot;Hey lets update the model viewer, we haven't done that since Blizzcon, what should we put up there?&quot;...&quot;Female dwarf?&quot;...&quot;BRILLIANT!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
they have never in the history of ever used the word &quot;at launch&quot; or confirmed. <br />
<br />
i keep up with all of the blue post and the &quot;blue post&quot; people keep mentioning about bc races being at launch is actually a tweet from chris's twitter where someone asked why draenei and blood elves werent on the site and he said that they will add them because the plan has changed and they are now just as much a priority. <br />
<br />
people like you are the reason why when patches come out and things werent finished people make threads saying &quot;blizz promised me so and so&quot; <br />
<br />
you take tweets and blue posts saying things like &quot;trying to&quot; and &quot;maybe&quot; and turn them into &quot;confirmed&quot; and &quot;promised&quot; <br />
<br />
are they trying their best to get as many as possible at launch? yes<br />
<br />
are they CONFIRMED at launch? no. blizzard never, ever said they were confirmed.<br />

Thank you for the lesson in how art works....? Im just saying, who is in charge there? &quot;Hey lets update the model viewer, we haven't done that since Blizzcon, what should we put up there?&quot;...&quot;Female dwarf?&quot;...&quot;BRILLIANT!!&quot;<br />
<br />
you dont understand. <br />
<br />
it wasnt &quot;hey who should we put up next&quot; <br />
<br />
it was &quot;hey we finished the female dwarf go ahead and put her up there&quot; <br />
<br />
they didnt choose to put the dwarf up there first. it just got finished faster than the others.</div></div><hr />

Once again the upgraded hair looks a little different than I thought it would. I didn't think that hairstyle was supposed to have bangs, and the back looks chopped off instead of all being gathered into the braid (hairstyle is even called &quot;Gathered&quot;). But the model looks good, I thought she was gonna be skinnier based on the front view, but from a side view I can see she still has a (slight) belly and I'm glad.<br />
<br />
But of course another female get's a breast reduction. What happened to &quot;silhouettes will remain the same&quot;? I hate it when game designers demonize femininity.<br />
<br />
I think it's stupid when people think the Dwarf female is &quot;so ugly&quot;. I think people just think of the idea of &quot;A Dwarf female&quot; instead of actually looking at her. Female dwarves are prettier than Undead, Worgen, Trolls, Gnomes, Pandaren, Tauren and arguably Orcs and Goblins. They're closer to being the prettiest race than the ugliest. <br />
Also, Dwarf males are uglier than Dwarf Females, but female characters' appearance always get criticized 10x harder.</div></div><hr />

They just said shorter tiers<br />
Not 6 month tiers<br />
<br />
And for end expansion tiers they just have to beat the 10-11 months of DS. So we still have 4 more months (at least) before we hit that.<br />

People still won't roll female dwarves. Seems like everyone on alliance plays human, with a few night elves mixed in since humans can't be druids. I would like to see more racial diversity, which is one of the advantages that horde has.<br />
<br />
The time has come for racial benefits to be done away with. Put all the races on an equal footing. Humans getting a free trinket slot is simply too powerful, and creates a situation where if you don't roll a human for alliance PvP, then you're a &quot;noob.&quot;<br />
<br />
The situation is equally problematic on horde side with undead getting Will of the Forsaken. What's funny is that dwarf priests used to have Fear Ward, but that was done away with because everybody was rolling dwarf for priest PvP. But undead basically have their own version of a free Fear Ward, and Blizzard has done nothing to correct that imbalance. So all the high level horde priests play undead for their free Fear Ward. Actually, Will of the Forsaken is far more imbalanced than Fear Ward ever was, since WotF can be cast while you're feared, unlike Fear Ward.<br />
<br />
What they should do is get rid of Will of the Forsaken (and all the other racial perks), and change Fear Ward so that it can be used to remove fear on you or another player who is already feared.<br />
<br />
Also, they should re-work water in the game to add waves. You go to a beach in WoW and the water is completely calm. It's tragically unrealistic. But that's a rant for another day.</div></div><hr />

Seeing as most people don't PVP at a level that the free trinket matters, i doubt that is what is the sway.<br />

I guess I thought you mean romantically attractive. But Dwarf women got the tough, beer-loving theme and norse mountain woman theme like a Valkyrie or something. Definitely not plain and forgettable. So they're cooler to me. <br />
<br />
Saying Dwarf women are plain and forgettable is pretty much saying Dwarf men are plain and forgettable since they have the same theme. That's why I assumed you meant romantically attractive because it doesn't make sense why you'd only play Dwarf males if you're talking about theme attractiveness.</div></div><hr />

I love Horde, but racial diversity is something we don't have. We're pretty much all Blood Elves. I think Alliance is more diverse actually. And it's obvious why everyone picks Humans and Nelves, Humans are always popular in MMOs and Night Elves are pretty elves like Blood Elves. I don't see many people picking their race because of combat racials.</div></div><hr />

Both really. I don't find dwarf (or undead) women romantically attractive, and I don't find dwarf women aesthetically/thematically attractive either. They don't repulse me (that steamy romance novel with the forsaken girl gave me the heeby jeebies for like an hour), but they don't attract be either on any level.<br />
<br />
In the end, it's all in the eye of the beholder. You see a &quot;tough, beer-loving theme and norse mountain woman theme&quot; but to me they are just kinda dumpy and uninteresting.<br />

Last I checked, the Horde was actually more evenly spread than the alliance. The BEs don't make up as big a % of horde characters as humans are a % of alliance characters, and we have a 3-way tie for second place while night elves blow away all other non-humans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just because a model is played less or more doesnt effect how soon it gets done. art doesnt work like that. <br />
<br />
they arent going one by one they are doing all of them all the time all at once. <br />
<br />
male human is like the most played race. well maybe they are having problems figuring out how to nail the human. maybe something happened internally, perhaps the main human guy lacked a bit of inspiration one day and that slowed down his work a bit. <br />
<br />
you cant shove art on a conveyor belt and just smash it out. thats not how art works.<br />

This is WOW, WHERE THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? It's supposed to look over the top and anything BUT subtle, with shoulders that wouldn't fit through a door and facial hair you could carve a statue with. Where the fuck do people like you come from after all these years? Have you not been paying attention to model animation's evolution in WOW since TBC? <br />
<br />
Here, learn something. This is supposed to look like a Don Bluth cartoon, essentially. <br />

<br />
She looks great, hearty full belly laughter. Sister of Ironforge, warrior of stone look going on.<br />
<br />
Also guys. do consider that there is a wide range of emotion that goes on during any Emote now. Remember those ridiculous looking photos of celebrity faces? those are just photographers taking shots of people mid-expressions during facial expression transition's. <br />
<br />
the same thing is going on here. The animations are so emotionally complex right now that a single shot cant capture the full range, instead we get odd transitional-looking expressions. We need some moving models to show the true face of the models (pun intended).</div></div><hr />

all other models are unfinished. they are not promised to be at launch.<br />
<br />
No. None of these we've been shown are finished for one thing, and all of them are planned to be finished for WOD barring Murphy's Law, it's assumed they won't have an issue doing it, but of course they won't commit to it. <br />
<br />
They only are shown when they feel in a state worth showing, but not finished at all. Just more finished than the others they are all working on at the same time off and on from here to there. <br />

<br />
I like Dwarf Females and I don't think they're ugly, but bearded dwarf women would be totally awesome. Lore-wise they exist, and they're known for being especially beautiful in their clans because of their beards. Read that on WoWpedia a long time ago. But I would keep my dwarf woman without a beard, just would be funny to see other players and NPCs with them.</div></div><hr />

Well anyway I do like on how people might like or dislike the Dwarves, but I am glad mine is a male Dwarf. Always liked them over the females, and no I am not sexist, just was a big fan of male Dwarves. <br />

<br />
Doesn't matter. People still won't roll female dwarves. Seems like everyone on alliance plays human, with a few night elves mixed in since humans can't be druids. I would like to see more racial diversity, which is one of the advantages that horde has.<br />
<br />
The time has come for racial benefits to be done away with. Put all the races on an equal footing. Humans getting a free trinket slot is simply too powerful, and creates a situation where if you don't roll a human for alliance PvP, then you're a &quot;noob.&quot;<br />
<br />
The situation is equally problematic on horde side with undead getting Will of the Forsaken. What's funny is that dwarf priests used to have Fear Ward, but that was done away with because everybody was rolling dwarf for priest PvP. But undead basically have their own version of a free Fear Ward, and Blizzard has done nothing to correct that imbalance. So all the high level horde priests play undead for their free Fear Ward. Actually, Will of the Forsaken is far more imbalanced than Fear Ward ever was, since WotF can be cast while you're feared, unlike Fear Ward.<br />
<br />
What they should do is get rid of Will of the Forsaken (and all the other racial perks), and change Fear Ward so that it can be used to remove fear on you or another player who is already feared.<br />
<br />
Also, they should re-work water in the game to add waves. You go to a beach in WoW and the water is completely calm. It's tragically unrealistic. But that's a rant for another day.I disagree, racials give each race their uniquess. And only a minority of the player base actually plays a race for racials. Also will of the forsaken is different from the human racial. Will of the forsaken shares a cd with your pvp trinket, the human racial does not. Take away the share cd on will of the forsaken I wouldn't mind. Would be nice to see people play more undead than seeing a bunch of prissy arrogant blood elves everywhere.</div></div><hr />
