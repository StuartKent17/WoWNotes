<br />
Welcome once again to Artcraft! I’m Chris Robinson, art director of World of Warcraft. This Artcraft is another quick one, but still packed with goodies. Today we’re showing you our work on the male Draenei. The original was one of the better character models in the game, so it didn’t require a ton of translation—but with higher-resolution textures and more polygons to work with, we were able to bump up his fidelity quite a bit, as well as improve how we convey emotion through a new animation rig.<br />
<br />
That’s all for now—thanks again for continuing to follow along as we develop these updated character models. See you next time!<br />
<br />
<br />
Heart of the Valorous Buff This Weekend<br />
Beginning Friday, July 11 at 9:00 a.m. PDT, through Monday, July 14 at 9:00 a.m. PDT, we’ll be applying the Heart of the Valorous buff which will increase the rate of Valor Point gains an additional 100%. Don’t wait to get in on the action!<br />
<br />

<br />
I like how the muscles are more contoured and visible. The hands...well, I don't like the hands on most of the models (too huge!). The tentacles...eh never liked them, but they seem kind of &quot;off&quot; to me.<br />
<br />
I wish they would have included some animations of the new emotes.</div></div><hr />

Until people pointed out that 99% of the Alliance questgivers and overall NPCs we'll interact with in WoD are Draenei, and it'd be rather unbalanced to have Horde with new model questgivers while Alliance get stuck with BC quality models.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This one just gets my goat.<br />
<br />
There's something wrong with the arms, but I'm not sure what it is. I don't know if they're too straight or if they hover outwards too much. The tendrils are off-color (maybe just a skin color bug) and still seem boxy, and he tendril and tail rings are super plain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Troll raid in the middle of Draenor, obviously.<br />
<br />
I mean, there was a troll raid in the middle (technically off the NW corner) of Pandaria, so why not an alternate universe alien planet?<br />
<br />
OT: Yeah, looks much better in all regards except for the nondescript facial appendages. They do not properly quiver with anticipation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/spacegoat02.jpg<br />

Also, another contributing factor tot he slightly off posture is the fact the new draenei's shoulders aren't as freakishly broad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hair really needs reworked, it looks super patchy. Then the rings on the face tentacles.. How are these not geometry? Good rings are 30-50 polys x 8 rings = 400 polys - That seems very in budget. Hell even shitty 15 poly rings would do better than the painted on look there currently is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well they basically just say the same thing with every art craft: &quot;we tried to stay true to form&quot; and not really much else to it. Looks good though, especially the facial animations. And about the tentacles, just because the model is featured in an artcraft doesn't mean it's complete. it's still very much a work in progress. These are just to show the progress so far. And not everyone who goes to the game website also comes to mmo-champion, and not everyone is in the beta, so this could be news to them even though its kinda old news to you guys.</div></div><hr />

The original was one of the better character models in the game<br />
<br />
lol, WHAT!?!?!? According to WHO? <br />

I do like the fact that they restructured the upper torso to look more realistic, but they made the face more, human? <br />

<br />
I will agree that the face tentacles are a bit off. They seem to be a bit less saturated and more light in color and it makes them stand out. As for the tentacle jewels, I think that they should thin the rings near the face (like the original) because it will make them look less 'attached' to the face. Making the rings themselves less saturated would also be smart.<br />
<br />
All in all, great job! :D</div></div><hr />

Better yet, why the fark can't Blizzard just up the Valor cap to 1500 or even 2k, instead of the paltry 1000? (Of course, I could say remove the cap, but we all know that's as likely to happen as another totally honest politician being elected President.)<br />

Has nothing to do with testosterone, it's what happens when you have low body fat. At my leanest I had visible veins in my arms (albeit not that extreme) and I'm a 5 foot woman.

There's plenty of things to go for &quot;next week&quot; without relying on the artificial gate. Not everyone has cleared SoO, downed Garrosh Normal/Heroic, gotten PVp titles, etc. Limiting player growth potential only serves to make people not want to bother, IMO.</div></div><hr />

An old model is graceful, while the new one is looks like a stump. New model is just don't looks attractive, without a neck and this specific for draenei race spine curve.<br />
Face and expressions are really cool, but not on this body. Draenei were very beautiful race, with the Orient grace. Now both male and female models are lost their elegance.<br />
Yes, I know that game is about war, so there isn't any place for such a things like beauty, elegance.<br />
I'm afraid what will I see instead of Blood elves, when they'll be released. War machines. Cubical form.</div></div><hr />
