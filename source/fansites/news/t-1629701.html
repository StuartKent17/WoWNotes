Warlords of Draenor Ad in Times Square<br />
This morning Blizzard shared a nice picture of a Warlords of Draenor ad in Times Square that features new Gorehowl model (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/august/axe_2h_gorehowl_d_01_hd.jpg).<br />

<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Gathering Professions<br />
Today we are taking a look at the changes to Mining, Herbalism, and Skinning in Warlords of Draenor, as well as the garrison buildings that accompany them.<br />
<br />
Mining<br />
<br />
Two new types of ore: Blackrock Ore (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109118-blackrock-ore) and True Iron Ore (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109119-true-iron-ore). <br />
Warlords of Draenor removes the smelting step and uses ores directly. <br />
No need to go to a trainer to increase your Mining cap, just go to Draenor and start playing, A Treatise on Mining in Draenor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/111349-a-treatise-on-mining-in-draenor) will drop from a mob or appear when gathering something.<br />
You can now mine any node at any level and you will receive Nuggets (http://www.wowdb.com/items/trade-goods/metal-stone?filter-search=Nugget) instead of the normal ore if your skill level is too low. Nuggets can be combined (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/157517-true-iron-nugget) to form ore.<br />
You will also receive Draenic Stone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115508-draenic-stone) when mining in Draenor, which is used for work orders at your garrison's mine (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1477-Warlords-of-Draenor-Garrisons-Lunarfall-Excavation-Frostwall-Mines).<br />
Ore is acquired in several ways:<br />
<br />
Drops from Goren Protector (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/85294-goren-protector) while mining. <br />
Mined from deposits (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/mining-veins?filter-id-val=222000&amp;filter-id-op=1&amp;filter-search=Deposit) found in the world.<br />
Everyone can collect some ore daily from their garrison's mine (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1477-Warlords-of-Draenor-Garrisons-Lunarfall-Excavation-Frostwall-Mines). <br />
Purchased (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109118-blackrock-ore?reagent-for-page=2#related:sold-by;_!) with Garrison Resources (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources) from the Trading Post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/893-Warlords-of-Draenor-Garrisons-Trading-Post) in your garrison.<br />
Contained in salvage containers (http://www.wowdb.com/items/consumables/consumable?filter-search=Salvage) from your garrison's Salvage Yard.<br />
<br />
The Goren Protector (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/85294-goren-protector) that will occasionally spawn and attack you has a low chance to drop the Red Goren Egg (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118919-red-goren-egg) (Ore Eater (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/85667-ore-eater)) pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Herbalism<br />
<br />
Seven new herbs: Talador Orchid (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109129-talador-orchid), Starflower (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109127-starflower), Nagrand Arrowbloom (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109128-nagrand-arrowbloom), Gorgrond Flytrap (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109126-gorgrond-flytrap), Frostweed (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109124-frostweed), Fireweed (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109125-fireweed), Chameleon Lotus (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109130-chameleon-lotus).<br />
No need to go to a trainer to increase your Herbalism cap, just go to Draenor and start playing, A Compendium of the Herbs of Draenor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/111350-a-compendium-of-the-herbs-of-draenor) will drop from a mob or appear when gathering something.<br />
You can now herb any node at any level and you will receive fragments (http://www.wowdb.com/items/trade-goods/herb?filter-expansion=6&amp;filter-ilvl-min=2&amp;filter-ilvl-max=90) instead of the normal herb if your skill level is too low. Fragments can be combined (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/157022-broken-frostweed-stem) to form herbs.<br />
You will also receive Draenic Seeds (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116053-draenic-seeds) when gathering herbs in Draenor, which is used for work orders and purchasing items at your garrison's herb garden (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1478-Warlords-of-Draenor-Garrisons-Herb-Garden).<br />
Herbs are acquired in several ways:<br />
<br />
Drops from Disturbed Podling (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs?filter-search=Disturbed+Podling) while gathering herbs. <br />
Gathered from nodes (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/herbs?filter-id-val=222000&amp;filter-id-op=1) found in the world.<br />
Everyone can collect some herbs daily from their garrison's herb garden (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1478-Warlords-of-Draenor-Garrisons-Herb-Garden). <br />
Purchased (www.wowdb.com/items/109129-talador-orchid#related:sold-by;_!) with Garrison Resources (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources) from the Trading Post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/893-Warlords-of-Draenor-Garrisons-Trading-Post) in your garrison.<br />
Contained in salvage containers (http://www.wowdb.com/items/consumables/consumable?filter-search=Salvage) from your garrison's Salvage Yard.<br />
<br />
The Disturbed Podlings (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs?filter-search=Disturbed+Podling) that will occasionally spawn and attack you have a low chance to drop the Nightshade Sproutling (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118595-nightshade-sproutling) (Nightshade Sproutling (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/83594-nightshade-sproutling)) pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Skinning<br />
<br />
One new skin: Raw Beast Hide (http://www.wowdb.com/items/110609-raw-beast-hide).<br />
No need to go to a trainer to increase your Skinning cap, just go to Draenor and start playing, A Guide to Skinning in Draenor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/111351-a-guide-to-skinning-in-draenor) will drop from a mob or appear when gathering something.<br />
You can now skin any skinnable animal at any level and you will receive fragments (http://www.wowdb.com/items/trade-goods/leather?filter-expansion=6&amp;filter-ilvl-max=90) instead of the normal skin if your skill level is too low. Fragments can be combined (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/159069-raw-beast-hide-scraps) to form useful skins.<br />
You can also obtain skins from your garrison's barn (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/885-Warlords-of-Draenor-Garrisons-Barn) <br />
Skins are also contained in salvage containers (http://www.wowdb.com/items/consumables/consumable?filter-search=Salvage) from your garrison's Salvage Yard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Herb Garden<br />
The Herb Garden (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/137-herb-garden) has its own plot that no other buildings can be placed upon. Everyone with a garrison has access to this building and is able to gather from the nodes, even without the Herbalism profession.<br />
<br />
Abilities<br />
This building is good for access to Herbalism nodes, even without the Herbalism profession.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 1 - Grows Draenic Seeds into herbs each day and herbalism nodes are available in the garden.<br />
Level 2 - Allows followers with the Herbalism trait to work here, granting a unique bonus. Also increases the amount of herbs that can be harvested at the garden and allows up to 14 work orders at one time.<br />
Level 3 - Grow a unique Draenor fruit tree in your garden that grants food buffs. Also allows up to 21 work orders at one time. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 3 Unlock<br />
The Level 3 version of this building is unlocked by completing the Draenic Seed Collector (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9454-draenic-seed-collector) achievement, which requires you to collect 500 Draenic Seeds (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116053-draenic-seeds) from herbalism nodes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Herbalism Output<br />
Each node has a chance to spawn a Disturbed Podling (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs?filter-search=Disturbed%20Podling), which will attack you and drop extra herbs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 1 - 6 herbalism nodes<br />
Level 2 - 11 herbalism nodes<br />
Level 3 - 16 herbalism nodes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Work Orders<br />
The Herb Garden allows you to collect Draenic Seeds (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116053-draenic-seeds) from herbalism nodes. You can then trade these seeds for additional herbs. <br />
<br />
For an added bonus and the ability to select what herbs grow every day, you can assign a follower (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/followers/180-shadow-hunter-rala-fiona) with Herbalism (http://beta.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/53-herbalism) to your garden. <br />
<br />
<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Garrisons: Mines<br />
The Lunarfall Excavation / Frostwall Mines (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/61-lunarfall-excavation) has its own plot that no other buildings can be placed upon. Everyone with a garrison has access to this building and is able to mine the nodes inside, even without the Mining profession.<br />
<br />
Abilities<br />
This building is good for access to mining nodes, even without the Mining profession.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 1 - Allows players to mine Draenic Stone from mineral nodes in Draenor. Draenic Stone can be converted to work orders for Draenor minerals.<br />
Level 2 - Allows followers with the Mining trait to work here, granting a unique bonus. Also opens a new mineshaft, granting access to additional mining nodes and allows up to 14 work orders at one time.<br />
Level 3 - A final mineshaft allows access to rich mining nodes. In addition, garrison guards will patrol your mine, keeping it clear of hostile goren. Also allows up to 21 work orders at one time. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 3 Unlock<br />
The Level 3 version of this building is unlocked by completing the Draenic Stone Collector (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9453-draenic-stone-collector) achievement, which requires you to collect 500 Draenic Stone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115508-draenic-stone) from mining nodes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mining Output<br />
Players can extract resources from nodes in the mine, even without the Mining profession. Nodes will show up on the map, just like they would if you had Mining.<br />
<br />
There are also Mine Carts (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/232541-mine-cart) in the Level 2 and Level 3 mine, which contain Warlords Archaeology Fragments, Ore, Preserved Mining Pick (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118903-preserved-mining-pick), and Miner's Coffee (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118897-miners-coffee). The Mining Pick and Coffee drop frequently enough that you will have at least one to use every day while mining. <br />
<br />
<br />
Daily Output<br />
Keep in mind that this is a rough idea of how much you can expect each day, not exact numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 1 - 20 x True Iron Ore (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109119-true-iron-ore), 10 x Blackrock Ore (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109118-blackrock-ore), and 15 x Draenic Stone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115508-draenic-stone).<br />
Level 2 - 35 x True Iron Ore (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109119-true-iron-ore), 15 x Blackrock Ore (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109118-blackrock-ore), and 30 x Draenic Stone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115508-draenic-stone).<br />
Level 3 - 55 x True Iron Ore (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109119-true-iron-ore), 25 x Blackrock Ore (http://www.wowdb.com/items/109118-blackrock-ore), and 40 x Draenic Stone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115508-draenic-stone).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Work Orders<br />
The Mine allows you to collect Draenic Stone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/115508-draenic-stone) from mining nodes. You can then trade 5 of these for some ore. <br />
<br />
For an added bonus, you can add a follower (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/followers/157-lantresor-of-the-blade-lantresor-of-the-blade) with the Mining (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/abilities/52-mining) ability.<br />

EU Feedback Thread Comment in Documentary<br />
We do get valuable feedback from the EU forums, both directly from the English forums and translated/summarized by members of our Community team from the other language forums. I winced a little bit at that quote in the documentary as well, just because I knew it might be taken the wrong way.<br />
<br />
For full context, for those who weren't participating or around during the early days of our Warlords beta testing, the first day of raid testing was a mess. We scheduled a Butcher test as our first raid test of the expansion and the massive number of people trying to zone in at once was chain-crashing our instance servers (due to a bug that we found and fixed within a few hours, thanks to the data obtained from monitoring testers). I had made specific feedback threads on both the NA and EU forums (as I always do) for the boss, and unsurprisingly the threads ended up being dominated by comments about server stability with little useful info about the bosses themselves. That's why I said &quot;there is actually some genuine feedback...&quot; - we'd written off the test as something that wasn't likely to yield anything constructive at all.<br />
<br />
In general, we get (and use) tons of useful feedback from our EU raid tests. As I said on Twitter, that brief clip was about this one specific thread, and was not a general statement.<br />
<br />
You have to admit scrolling past the Picard facepalm ASCII made for some fine comic timing alongside my comments, though - kudos to the editing team for that pairing.

Warlords Launch Q&amp;A, Live Wednesday Nov 12th!<br />
This Wednesday, I’ll be joining World of Warcraft Lead Game Designer Ion Hazzikostas and Lead Class Designer Kris Zierhut to answer your questions live on Twitch.TV! With Warlords of Draenor’s launch only a couple of days away, we’re sure there’s plenty of questions we weren’t able to answer at BlizzCon, and now is your chance to ask them!<br />
<br />
When: Wednesday, November 12th, 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM Pacific Standard Time (see this handy tool (http://bit.ly/1pFQW3C) to find when that is in your local time!)<br />
Where: The World of Warcraft channel on Twitch.TV/WoW (http://www.twitch.tv/wow)<br />
<br />
There are two ways to submit questions. If you’re using Twitter, simply tweet your question using the hashtag #WarlordsQA. You can also ask it as a reply to this forum thread; however, as we’d like to get to as many questions as possible, we will only consider questions using 40 words or less. Make them count! In order to be considered, your question must be submitted before 12:01 AM PST on Wednesday, November 12th.<br />
<br />
See you there!<br />

could you maybe make it so you don't have to glyph something random first before you can swap two incompatible glyphs?<br />
Yes we'd like to improve that. In the mean time, you can just right-click a glyph to remove it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/528753579642085376))<br />

Character / Items<br />
I just got Gromloc &amp; added him &amp; got no Achievement. I hope this is a bug.<br />
Fixed in 6.1, our apologies, you will retroactively achieve your FoS. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/528331491726860289))<br />
<br />
Blazing Wings have a minor graphical glitch on some models like the legendary cloak did, hangs out to the side w/Magical Ogre Idol<br />
Global art fix, tasked, not likely to make it in a hotfix, but we'll make these attachment points consistent for all items. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/529145706381344768))<br />
<br />
Blazing Wings buff disappearing on Druid shapeshift while other transformation buffs don't disappear. Bug or intended?<br />
Need to fix some attachment points, they'll make a return (as will other back-attached items). (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/529145836916465665))<br />

PvE<br />
If a raid ignores Highmaul optional bosses and kills Imperator, will the optional bosses still be there later?<br />
Yes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/528629780657500160))<br />

PvP<br />
When does season 16 will start? I can't find it on the internet. Thanks for answering<br />
December 2nd (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/529074157376794624))<br />
is it gonna be season 16 or WoD Season 1?<br />
WoD Season 1 (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/529320318025093121))<br />
so wait is anything going to change on the system how I get HP and CP or you guysjust trying names?<br />
just names (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/529336683280752640))<br />
<br />
when does honor gear get released?<br />
It releases with Warlords (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/529372117117067265))<br />
<br />
Color of arena flags annoy me. IMO They are hard to identify (too faint?) which is yellow and which is green. Consider change them?<br />
Yes considering it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/528598601069785088))<br />
<br />
Have you guys ever tested objective-based 5v5? I loved how GW2 did it in SPvP, so I'm wondering how well it'd work in WoW.<br />
think it might play pretty well but where does it fit in the broader PVP picture. We have a lot already. We'll see. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/528601372108017665))<br />
Also nothing stopping people from trying some 5v5 war games. I recommend 2 orb ToK. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/528601493570879488))<br />
<br />
I thought you weren't going to be allowed to switch specs in a BG? Just watched a DK switch from his dps spec to blood. Intended?<br />
it only prevents switching from healer to non-healer specs. System intent is balancing healers on each team. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/528686787267674112))<br />
<br />
with crafted pvp sets I felt like I had a fighting chance coming in late but now I'll have to suffer to get bags, how is that fun?<br />
Instead of contenders sets we just level up the gear in battlegrounds and arenas (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/529060604783644673))<br />
<br />
Will levelling through PvP ever be as equal-speed to PvE levelling? I want to PvP to 100 on my main and wondering how fast it'd be?<br />
Questing is intended to be the fastest way to level and gear up for an expansion. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/529078266158911489))<br />
<br />
if you guys could give the option to hide your zone or queue inside a rbg it will be huge so players don't spend hours dodging<br />
yeah the hidden presence one is certainly something to consider (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/529337110827106305))<br />
<br />
Reputation / Questing<br />
but its irrelevant content on chars that are boosted, no challange, and natural play can miss the bulk of 1-90 via speed<br />
Absolutely don't disagree. I think &quot;any zone at any level&quot; could be a lot of fun at some point in the future. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/528800562591322112))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
I mean daily quests that we're currently holding in our quest log. Rumors that they'll be reset so people don't get a jump on lvln<br />
Not 100% sure, but with no concept of realm first 100, I'd suggest exploring Draenor. Lots of rares, garrison stuff, etc. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/528799191091646464))<br />
I've experienced the zones plenty ! I'm more concerned with min/maxing my route and time to get ahead of the crowd,<br />
Worth thinking about: garrison resources are finite and very important for garrison progression. Suggest min-maxing that. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/528799892341526528))<br />

You can now herb any node at any level and you will receive fragments instead of the normal herb if your skill level is too low. Fragments can be combined to form ore.<br />

He is actually right, with 6.0 changes, nerfs and buffs to classes and systems, 5.4 content isn't current content anymore since it's out of sync and easier. Even with the change to 4 upgrades instead of 2, the 5.4 content started to get out of sync alread.<br />

<br />
Doesn't it kind of show that either raids have become easier on a whole, or that the gap between normal and heroic has become so great that someone who I assume is decked out in heroic warforged gear is able to actually solo the final raid boss of the expansion? Am I the only one who thinks it's totally audacious that's even possible? <br />
<br />
No disrespect to Mione though, it's very impressive.<br />
<br />
It's 6.0. So it's actually a huge gap since it's Garrosh Normal (old Flex). If you're fully decked in Mythic Warforged gear, you're outgearing normal raid (old flex) by a lot. Only with Heroic warforged (old normal), you won't exactly get this huge gap to allow soloing it.</div></div><hr />

Gratz on kill Mione, even if its normal. as for dk's being OP.. if they are so OP. i would like to see dk solo Mythic garry or heroic Garry (actually i think heroic garry would be easy to solo since its same as normal minus the health and dmg out put).<br />

Classes are broken after the patch. They will be balanced @ 100.<br />
And Blood DK is always kinda good soloing old stuff because they have more self healing because they take more damage than the other tanks. It's a class design.</div></div><hr />

My post wasnt agreeing that Dks are op.. it was stating that having this set of gear and this set of items and being over the limit thresh hold is why 1 is able to solo Garry Normal. <br />
Dks being able to solo old stuff, of course.. almost any plate class can depending on few things. so that argument is sorta invalid (I agree to a point &quot;Better Healing&quot;) but they are not even close to being an OP Class like that person said.</div></div><hr />

Yes that makes perfect sense but in WoD....every crafting prof uses ore and herbs not sure about the skins but I know from the beta that people were complaining that alch and chanting needed ore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Berserk timer is 25 minutes for normal, if I'm remembering correctly, he gets the kill something like 7 seconds before enrage. Lust is from LW drums. He doesn't get MC'd because he has threat, the wolf is still up so he can use Dark Simulacrum to steal chain lightning from it for extra damage.</div></div><hr />

Yes, blood Dk is currently strong due to whacky tuning at 90, but it still took an exceptionally skilled and geared player something like 164 attempts, with the kill finally happening with just 7s to go until the boss enraged (dbm timers are incorrect).<br />
<br />
This is a huge triumph of not just skill but perseverance. Amazing when you consider how many players give up after a single wipe in raid finder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So just because there is one skilled player the whole class needs a nerf?<br />
<br />
I bet the majority of those within the same ilvl doesnt have a chance of soloing this.</div></div><hr />

You know, Earth is a round planet, which rotates around it's rotational axis that goes from the northpole to the southpole. One rotation takes (approximately) 24 hours and thus, the planet has been divided into 24 hour long timezones. The direction of the rotation is from west towards east and therefore, thanks to timezones, the clocks are ahead in the east. Since Europe is to the east from the Americas, we hit the local midnight, and the release of the expansion, few hours earlier than the USA.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Meintastic</div><div class="date">2014-11-12, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes.... I wish they would have Newfoundland, Canada as its own launch timer. We get the xpac 5 am in the morning, which is almost as bad as Steam releases(which release at 10 thanks to Pacific Standard).<br />
<br />
I'm not saying we should get it way before everyone else, but make the xpac release based on time zone, it would solve a ton of issues for them, especially with mobs being camped preventing leveling, and player density causing the expansion to crash; so the xpac would release 12 for us, 12:30 for atlantic canada, 1:30 for eastern canada etc(I used my timezone for this situation, so really its 12 for every timezone)<br />

They already did that<br />
<br />
I dont see why EU need there release time early, the servers dont need to go down, theres just a time set that WoD content is avaliable, so this should be universal</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cos they want(need) to release it at midnight. Enough people will be awake at midnight to login test the stability/possibly unnoticed game breaking bugs and (crash the servers) and give BLZ the time to hopefully tweek and fix such issues BEFORE the majority logs in ie. after school/work.<br />
<br />
It make zero sense at all to have it released at any other time than midnight. World first pff, those charts can be adjusted to fulfill the need for e-peen fairness. All that matter is that BLZ get the maximum ammount of time to deal with the unforseen before the majority of players log in :)</div></div><hr />

He looks to be abusing some sort of mechanic to summon adds for healing, perhaps? I always thought any content should be soloable - I hated forming / maintaining raid groups. Just make raids exceptionally hard for 1 person to do.</div></div><hr />

Small correction. No Tank spec ever gets MC'ed. Doesn't matter if you're tanking Garrosh or not.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why US have to use shitloads of timezones. You are all un the freakin States, use one timezone. <br />
You know how many timezones China should have? i'll tell you : FIVE (5) . And still they use only one. Ask your government for something similar :))</div></div><hr />

Because the continent is big and spans across multiple timezones. Seriously due to earths rotation it can never be the same time of the day across all states.</div></div><hr />
