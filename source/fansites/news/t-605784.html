<meta name="description" content="2.4 PTRs down until further notice 
PTRs have been taken down to increase the amount of people testing the TTRs. That's a pretty good news actually because it looks like they need to rush a few tests ... maybe because the patch is going live soon ?  
In order to gather additional logging information for the Tournament Test realm we will be taking down the regular 2.4 PTRs until further notice. We encourage everyone to check out the TTR to help us test our new hardware configurations.

Comics<br />
First, a small update of comics with the release of Dark Legacy #134 (http://www.darklegacycomics.com/134.html), I also received a mail about ... Shakes &amp; Fidget (http://www.getbuffed.com/getbuffed/comics/list/1) ! If you've been reading WoW comics for a long time you'll probably remember this one and be very happy to know that it's translated into english once again. <br />

The last skill, you need to present us to pass your exam is &quot;Blink&quot;<br />
All you need to do is blink exactly 20 meters straight forward.<br />
Right on this spot.<br />
Oh no - Get lost you moron<br />
Give it you best shot, Fidget! Concentrate!<br />
I failed this exam 15 times. Everytime because of this silly blink .... This time it will work. Focus on the target .... concentrate<br />
I'm sorry, Fidget. I cant let you pass as long as you can't do this.<br />
Damn exams. I can't get this dumb spell working.... I will never become a real Mage<br />
Tell me about it....&quot;Get me 10 Wolf Hides&quot; here &quot;kill 12 Boars&quot; there.... I will never become a famous and strong warrior that way...<br />
You know... in the past with my partner i seeked a magic artifect, which grants you great magic might! It is guarded by a skeletton warrior which posses a mighty sword....<br />
I think you had enough<br />
We had the only existing map but my partner got lost with it....He is probably not alive anymore....<br />
SHAKES! Did you hear that?!<br />
Wha?<br />
If we find this artifact i will pass the exam and nobody will laught at me anymore<br />
Just think about what an adventure that would be! And when everybody finds out that we found the artifact and defeated the guardian we will be famous and they are gonna respect us!<br />
Hm...<br />
Hey, maybe you are right! Maybe they will write about us in history books.<br />
?to the adventure? (Charge? :D For Gnomeregan? ^^) We get better be started right away.<br />
Boah, i feel sick!<br />
_5 min later_<br />
Perfekt, i have no idea where to start...<br />
If the guy with the map is dead maybe it (map) is near his corpse... but how should we know where he died?!<br />
Hm....If somebody knows it when, how and where somebody died...<br />
than is it BOB the spirit guide in the afterlife.<br />
Oh no! You sure better not be suggesting what i think you will...<br />
On the count on three<br />
One, two....<br />
....THREEEEeeeeeeeee!<br />
Are you dead yet?<br />
No but nearly....at least I'm seriously wounded!<br />
Thats not gonna work. We need to think about something else.<br />
<br />
Whoever wants to correct my spelling and fill in the bubbles go ahead but please add a nice &quot;Translated by Vaizard&quot; at the bottom</div></div><hr />

<br />
My other comp is a Mac and cant use any addons <br />
http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5286962908&amp;sid=1<br />
<br />
He states they can't change it but will post 2.4....<br />
<br />
Say hello to 2.4 Next Week<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem described there seems to be coming from the fact that the poster is using symbolic links (a filesystem feature). Normally installed addons are most likely not affected at all, so don't worry.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Doubt it, but in my opinion it wouldn't be impossible to see it next week though. <br />
<br />
<br />
I also thought it was too soon Executus ;D , but next week is easter so probably not gonna happen then (Easter monday). Still it would be good if it is online over these days, which actually only leaves this week. In any case, I think there are enough signs that it is very soon.</div></div><hr />

Arena has already destroyed so much of the plain vanilla wow that many (insert: Raiders) so much enjoyed. Now they even openly admit that they want to FORCE people into doing arenas instead of PvE...<br />

Or maybe they already have all the data they need from the PvE testing. I mean ... you do realize this is the test realm, right? No one is going to force you to PvP on live realms.<br />
<br />
Generally, I think it makes sense to just test the things that, ya know, need testing.</div></div><hr />
