Paladin - Censure Hotfix Incoming 
After monitoring thousands of Firelands kills, we've concluded that Retribution’s damage was not where we wanted it to be, so we're going to increase Censure damage by roughly 40%. We'll also be keeping an eye on paladin damage as we move towards patch 4.3. We expect that this hotfix should be applied sometime later today.

Paladin - Censure Hotfix Incoming<br />
After monitoring thousands of Firelands kills, we've concluded that Retribution’s damage was not where we wanted it to be, so we're going to increase Censure damage by roughly 40%. We'll also be keeping an eye on paladin damage as we move towards patch 4.3. We expect that this hotfix should be applied sometime later today.<br />
<br />
We're also considering shifting some of the damage from Hammer of Wrath into other attacks. While that may not necessarily cure some of the current concerns about proc reliance, it should help smooth out damage a bit. <br />

<br />
Obviously you don't play Ret in raids. Continuously being at the bottom of charts against people in the same gear levels just because of how your class is tuned and because of a horribly designed mechanic(Holy Power), was dumb. This is a very welcome change. <br />

if im thinking correctly this wont happen, as censure and mastery are utterly unlinked, mastery only affects additional damage for our main moves (CS, DS, TV)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what Censure is.. I don't play Paladin though, and probably those that ask here don't either (or perhaps holy?). And yes, if you don't play paladin you CAN still be interested. 40% is in itself a big number, so what's up with that? How much % of total damage is Censure? Or if it's some sort of mechanic that I don't know about, will this change rotations? And will this change stat priorities? Changing something by 40% can be a big deal mid-Patch.</div></div><hr />

They have known since beta that the spec had an over reliance on procs &amp; CD's so what do they do ? well they nerf the CD's then add more passive damage ignoring the core problems.<br />

<br />
<br />
Censure is the passive dot applied by single target attacks from ret paladins with seal of truth active. <br />
It makes up like 5% of your total dps as ret so this is about a 1-2% dps upgrade, while that boost is nice it completely ignores the core issues with the class.</div></div><hr />

What this seems like to me is Blizzard putting a band-aid over the broken bone that is our dps spec to try and keep us going until the next expansion when they really have an opportunity to change things at the core, as opposed to just one patch.</div></div><hr />

I don't play Paladin though, and probably those that ask here don't either (or perhaps holy?). And yes, if you don't play paladin you CAN still be interested. 40% is in itself a big number, so what's up with that? How much % of total damage is Censure? Or if it's some sort of mechanic that I don't know about, will this change rotations? And will this change stat priorities? Changing something by 40% can be a big deal mid-Patch.<br />
<br />
Censure accounts for about 8~10% of ret paladin's overall dmg done on boss fights,<br />
<br />
Having it increased by 40% will improve the overall dps by 4~5% at best<br />
<br />
It's not really going to bring about any tangible changes to paladin dps in general, <br />
5% is completely within an acceptable margin of fluctuation of dps variations depending on procs in any given fights.</div></div><hr />

Gotta agree here. We got an ele and enh shaman, and they KNOW how to play and do reasonable dps. And it's always epic to see them save the day by tossing a few heals or dropping that certain totem in bad situations.<br />

Saying rshammies are ok is the same as saying ret paladins were top dps before this.<br />

Does that bring more fun to the spec? More usability? Good DPS? I somewhat doubt that hard. Ret needs a real overhaul (again) cuz the way this whole spec works, is wrong. Simply having Holy Wrath in a single target dps rota is enough input to call this spec &quot;fail&quot;. And yet the Holy Wrath thing is nothing but a small issue. We need less RNG, a dependable Holy Power generation (it is not possible to avoid getting dodges, parries or misses (nightelves) in pvp) and real fillers. And Zealotry should lower gcd to 1 sec. Hell, this community has so many good ideas and actually does Blizzard's job and yet it is only crap we get in the end. How can a whole team of devs be so incompetent? I'll take this buff, but only because I lack a choice..<br />
<br />
Ps.: They shouldn't exactly take dmg from HoW and put it into the rest, but from Wings.. It would make us less Wing dependent in PvP.. Or make Wings dispell immune and make it work like Pillars of Frost. Lower CD, lower usefulness, immune to dispell. This &quot;there's a ret, spam dispells, mates!&quot; is so getting on my nerves.</div></div><hr />

Go look at logs of good guilds and talk to me about Shaman competing anywhere. I'm pretty sure Paladins have it great and they just buffed them again in a spec that wasn't even meant to be viable in PvE. You already have Holy and Protection. This is just funny to me.</div></div><hr />

Obviously bottom of the charts is an exaggeration. You can look at logs and see the current state of Ret. We float around 7-9th spots on Damage Done.

It's only 1k if you're pushing near 30k dps, if you're at 20k, you'll see about a 600 dps increase, which is easily lost in RNG.<br />

I agree with that. Holy Paladins are pretty good in PvP, too, so I hear. It is all a matter of timing. I just hope they extend these changes in 4.3 and make all specializations viable somewhere (whether it be PvP or PvE). Some classes are sitting with a spec that is completely mediocre everywhere while others have all specs top-end damage/healing somewhere and that just isn't right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most the people commenting don't raid with or as a Ret paladin, in any competitive sense. Its no different to any class receiving a buff, then others whining &quot;why hasn't my class been buffed&quot;.<br />
<br />
Its nice to see them admit they are aware of it finally, though i'm sceptical how much a 40% increase of the censure dot will actually provide. It'll be interesting to see also if its just for Ret, or if Prot will benefit too.<br />
<br />
<br />
They should do something about the horribly boring &quot;rotation&quot; instead.<br />
<br />
I wish they would as well, but it doesn't seem like they view it as an issue. Maybe next expansion, like every expansion before now, we'll get the changes.</div></div><hr />

I stopped right there. Obvious troll is obvious.<br />
<br />
He's referring to Enhancers who use Eye of Purification, the SP axe. It's currently BIS set up for enhance and part of having a caster wep means that it becomes viable to cast Lava Bursts in lulls in rotation.<br />
<br />
As a raiding Shaman I agree, single target our damage is as good as we could ask for, middle to upper of the pack, ele and enh both got decent buffs in 4.2 to put them in good places, asking for DPS buffs is not conductive (not that I believe Blizz buff based on asking). Where we suffer at the moment is AOE, that's just solid fact, Shaman AOE is rubbish. HOWEVER, this pally buff is a hotfix, fixing our AOE is not something they can hotfix, it's broken, and it will need a complete overhaul which is something that can really be done in a major content patch.<br />
<br />
DPS shaman are perfectly viable for 99% of guilds in the world, without being a hindrance. Only the truly exceptional might exclude them, but that's more because those guilds focus on mechanics of classes that lend themself best to each boss and have the player base to just say &quot;hey, lets stack 16 druids for this fight&quot;.<br />
<br />
Finally I do not agree with the notion that because other paladin specs are good the last one should be ignored, the playstyle and role is so completely different it's just not a terribly good notion that one can just 'change spec'. If Enhance was doing poorly and other people told me that it's fine because I could just 'reroll ele' they would quickly find themselves on my ignore list. Blizz is a large enough company that fixing one spec should not mean they don't have enough time to fix another. We should be happy that our Ret friends will be doing more damage and helping us kill stuff quicker, I know I am.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They removed the faction-specific names with Cataclysm. Faction-specific seals in the sense of being unique were removed in Wrath of the Lich King; Seal of Blood was equivalent to Seal of the Martyr, Seal of Vengeance was equivalent to Seal of Corruption. During Wrath of the Lich King, Seal of Blood/Martyr was removed completely, and its impact damage was added to Seal of Vengeance/Corruption after the dot was fully stacked. With Cataclysm, both Seal of Vengeance and Seal of Corruption were renamed to Seal of Truth, while the dot was renamed from Holy Vengenace/Blood Corruption to Censure. <br />
<br />
(Note: Abandon is entirely correct, I'm simply expanding on what he said.)<br />
<br />
Edit: To be perfectly clear, the last time there were faction-specific seals not available to the other side was TBC, when Horde Paladins had Seal of Blood while Alliance Paladins had Seal of Vengeance.</div></div><hr />

Maybe increase Judgement damage by 100% base, and then change the talent in Prot that does that now to 'gives your Holy Wrath a 50/100% chance to spread your Censure to all targets' I'd like that alot :D it's never going to HAPPEN, but it'd be spiffy if it did<br />

I'm gunna take a wild guess here, and say this is just a small change now, and (hopefully...) when 4.3 drops there will be some ACTUAL buffs, this is just the only one they could easily 'hotfix' in, then hopefully they'll lower burst, and massivly boost sustained (and please do something about Holy Wrath.. it's just sad now...)</div></div><hr />

i wont complain tho, im glad they realized ret is a bit weak in the dps meters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Millywilly</div><div class="date">2011-09-10, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it's something, I'll wait to see what the mathematicians at EJ come up with for how much of buff this ends up being for ret. Doesn't seem like it will be enough and I wonder if that's part of what influenced that last part of that blue post. <br />
<br />
HoW isn't the way to go to off set increases to ret's sustained dps without making it's burst unreasonable. They're going to have at the real issues of ret having too much damage tied into CDs. Given that every spec has it's AW talent, they could just reduce the damage increase at the baseline and let the prot and holy AW talents tack that damage back on for them. The idea being to increase sustain dps with as little effect on burst as possible. GoAK is another option, but frankly the spec would be better off if AW was weakened with sustained buffs. If they do ever touch GoAK, I'd rather they removed the dps gain from it, with compensation to our damage elsewhere of course, and turned it into a utility CD for ret. Three dps CDs before adding in trinkets and potions is a bit much and despite how cool GoAK looks, AW and Zeal are for more interesting dps CDs. Finally, they need to get holy wrath out of the rotation and consecration completely out of the single target rotation. Bring back holy strike on a 10s CD, redesign HW into a pure utility ability, give consecration the 3.2 exo treatment (prot get's it instant cast by talent and ret get's it instant cast with AoW procs) and redesign sanctity of battle to reduce the CD on Holy Strike based on haste rating (the concept for the current SoB isn't bad but it's too cluncky as means to increase HP generation). <br />
<br />
I would love to see Blizz do all of that for 4.3 but I doubt they will even though the spec is in dire need of such mechanic changes now. Granted they have added new abilities and redesigned others mid-expansion in the past, so it isn't completely unrealistic. I just think they won't do it because they think such a change will upset too many people (I kind of doubt it, since most long time rets aren't happy with the current system).</div></div><hr />

That's probably one outdated mechanic they could get rid of to be honest. I don't really see any point of us having a damage increase against demons/undead when in the big scheme of things we'd have to be balanced around it, remove the guaranteed crit against demon/undead and balance us without it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shelly</div><div class="date">2011-09-10, 05:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ok so with the buff we are getting will out stats be same? Or mastery will be replaced by Haste for low CD on CS?<br />
<br />
Nothing changes. Us somehow stacking censure faster won't really matter all that much. <br />
<br />
The standard since just about the time they buffed our mastery to be mastery &gt; crit &gt; haste. <br />
<br />
Provided you're at your hit and expertise caps. <br />
<br />
The major caveat to that though is that once we reach enough haste to lower our CS CD to 3 seconds then haste will have overtaken crit by quite a bit. Currently they are about equal and I expect haste to overtake crit in 4.3. At which time I also expect our censure buff to possibly go away, we'll see. <br />
<br />
Really a lot of our problems would have been fixed if we were built around a stable 3-second CS rather than Blizz building us around a slow progression.</div></div><hr />

Main issue with dps paladins is that if we're bad and asked to change spec we can't dps anymore. Shamans have both elemental and enh, after the recent buff elemental shamans are doing quite well enh shaman aren't quite so good but they can change spec and not lose their spot but retribution paladins have been asked to reroll class or lose their dps spot in the guild... as i did, forced to tank or gtfo hurts, I'd gladly pay 600k gold to play holy dps if it was possible tanking is NOT fun.</div></div><hr />

Stop your trolling please. Specs under ret paladin are:<br />
1. Enchancement shaman. Those shammys who don't like their dps respec into elem.<br />
2. Assasination rogue. Those rogues who don't like their dps respec into combat.<br />
3. Arms warrior. Those warriors who don't like their dps respec into fury.<br />
4. Unholy DK. Those DKs who don't like their dps respec into frost.<br />
5. Survival hunter. Those hunters who don't like their dps respec into marksmanship.<br />
6. Destruction warlock. Those warlocks who don't like their dps respec into affliction or demonology.<br />
7. Subtlety rogue. Those rogues who don't like their dps respec into combat.<br />
8. Fire mage. Those mages who don't like their dps respec into arcane.<br />
9. Beast mastery hunter. Those hunters who don't like their dps respec into marksmanship.<br />
10. Frost mage. Those mages who don't like their dps respec into arcane.<br />
<br />

1st of all people still asking what the buff is at page 5 when it is answered in page 1 = What happent to searching for 5 seconds?<br />
<br />
2nd other classes (Shammies mostly) crying about this just as they do in any other buff any other class gets. Every class has its ups and downs they have to start somewhere. If it was a shammy buff im pretty sure most of paladins would go cry over there as well.. so bad.<br />
<br />
3rd paladins saying this is cool but why dont they change HOW WE PLAY. They hardly EVER change how a class works in mid-patch they probably will in 4.3 or maybe next expansion. They can't hotfix that kinda thing.<br />
<br />
Is it so hard for half of the community to avoid doing this kind of behavior?<br />
<br />
On topic: 3% dps overall or maybe 4% in single target. And a bit more in multi targeting (if you are actually switching targets and keep 5x dot up on each). We will move up to around 11th/10th viable dps spec i believe.</div></div><hr />

(In my opinion) At the moment, I am a ret pally raider. My gear is full 378, with the 4 set t12 bonus. The other day I did 26k on 10 heroic baleroc. Not great, but not bad for a 10 man run. The others in my group are slightly more geared than me, maybe around 382 ilvl, and our top dps (a boomkin) was 30k. We really are not THAT bad before this buff, but slightly. This will help a little bit. However I agree with most other ret posters here, they just need to fix the RNG 'rotation'. Also, I don't really like the idea of the hammer of wrath nerf, even if it does buff other abilities, I like being able to run back to the boss, jump, turn around mid-air and throw a HoW to finish off an add, E.G. a son of flame on ragnaros. So overall what I'm saying is: Ret is about middle of the road right now on damage, the problem with them failing is either just not knowing their class, or getting unlucky. ~Cormier, Whisperwind US~</div></div><hr />

Paragon killed Raggy HC? No shamans in raid this proves everything QQ. Paladin received a buff? Why you no buff Shaman?! <br />
<br />
Umm, I would like to see fixes to our aoes etc, too... but we DID get a buff after Rag HC kills, to Shamanism. Ele only, but about as much dps boost as this change.</div></div><hr />

Just about every team has a shaman in them. Its difficult for Blizz to buff a spec in PvE and not make it completely out of control in PvP. Its what essentially happened to Ret after patch 3.0. <br />
<br />
Ret is currently a complete joke. I PvP as ret and if I don't have all my CDs ready I can't kill anything solo, we simply do not have the damage output to keep up with other melee classes. What I find shitty is as a defensive class, they keep nerfing our defensive abilities (Sacred Shield is now holy mastery, can't LoH while bubbled, can't hand of protection and bubble back to back) while giving other classes more utility. Gee, I wish I could regain 20% of my health after I slow my target and sprint away, then vanish only to kidney shot back in and dismantle. But oh wait...I can't. <br />
<br />
Its a welcome buff, and I hope they do more to bring our baseline damage up that isn't so RNG oriented. I'm STILL wondering why we're the only class in the game without a slow (don't count that Avenger's Shield slow, that 4 second slow on that big of a cd doesn't count). How long do we have to bitch until we get that?</div></div><hr />

People only read the news post and ignore all the comments and react while being ignorant. Nothing new here.<br />
<br />
Everyone who doesnt get a buff bemoans the fact another class got one. Its happened for the past 6 years or more with this game.</div></div><hr />

Holly power should NOT affect Templars Verdict... should only affect inquisition.<br />
and when you get 3 loads of holly power, your next ability should cause more damage and be critical, that's all. =)<br />
<br />
I'm asking too much?!<br />
Yes, clearly the holly power needs to be reworked, damn plants messing with Ret rotation! :D</div></div><hr />

I guess this is why we have an elemental shaman top dps on heroic Rhyolith 25 man followed by an enhance shaman, and top heals are 2 resto shamans on the same fight.<br />

Yeah, shamans, really not good in PvE.</div></div><hr />

NO, you have that because your guild is bad. You let a melee class get into the top what on Rhyolith LOL. Enhance is nowhere near topping DPS charts, anecdotal evidence doesn't prove anything.<br />

They do realize this. It's called trolling. Why they don't get banned from so blatant trolling is beyond me though.</div></div><hr />

Who cares about absolute statistic ? Who cares about what is the medium dps of x spec on all players ?<br />
<br />
That's REALY not the question. The question is &quot;which spec is the best and which one is the worst&quot;. And for that question, it's pretty obvious that a sample of 200 of the best guilds in the world is enough. A R25 H-ragnaros-level isn't 25 random players playing together. It's 25 people &quot;of the same top end level&quot;, and that is what make the sample relevent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good enough for me, I imagine we'll see larger fixes in 4.3<br />
<br />
i was waitting for that &quot;Hotfix&quot; ....atleast i won't feel like being useless anymore &gt;:D <br />
Paladins got nerfed enough for a while :( time to get back on our feats</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">thundercles</div><div class="date">2011-09-12, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The actual buff is so miniscule that the vast majority of paladins will never even notice it.<br />
<br />
All this does is serve as an excuse to nerf the ret pally execute, gimping the class for pvp.<br />
<br />
What's absolutely goddamn hilarious is the fact that they KNOW the problem with pally dps is it's proc reliance but they seem to want to do anything BUT address that issue:<br />
<br />
&quot;We're also considering shifting some of the damage from Hammer of Wrath into other attacks. While that may not necessarily cure some of the current concerns about proc reliance, it should help smooth out damage a bit.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you need Enhance fixed you must be doing something wrong. I'm doing 16-17k dps in Troll Heroics wearing 4 Blues. Main Hand, Off Hand, Helm and Shoulders, in fact my shoulders are 333. Enhance is doing just fine tbh.</div></div><hr />
