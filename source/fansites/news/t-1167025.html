Pandaria<br />
Shrouded in mists since the world was sundered ten thousand years ago, the ancient realm of Pandaria has remained unspoiled by war. Its lush forests and cloud-ringed mountains are home to a complex ecosystem of indigenous races and exotic creatures. It is the homeland of the enigmatic pandaren, a race that celebrates life to the fullest even while under siege by an ancient menace.<br />

Colossus is not proccing of auto-attacks -- is this a bug?<br />
Yes, this should be fixed for the next build.<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight))<br />
Currently, the Gargoyle's Gargoyle Strike scales with a mechanism that does not seem to compare with any other pet ability mechanisms. We know you do not want to share specific values, but an explanation on what exactly affects the scaling of the spell would be helpful in modelling it.<br />
Wow, this was an obscure bug! Turns out that Gargoyle Strike was accidentally hooked up to a mechanic that made its damage scale in a very odd way. We just removed that and adjusted its damage to compensate. In the next build, Gary the Gargoyle will get 70% of your AP as SP, and Gargoyle Strike will do base damage based on level (623 at level 90) plus 82.6% of SP. Hope that helps!<br />

In it's current state Zen sphere went from OP to useless, leaving tier30 practically useless for the windwalker monk, any plans to change this in a future build?<br />
It’d be much more useful if there was some theorycrafting to back this up. Has this been tested? If so, please share your findings and numbers with us.<br />
<br />
Everyone’s feedback and hard work testing class abilities has been great. We really do appreciate it! I just want to echo what Ghostcrawler said earlier in this thread:<br />
<br />
Just a reminder that we really want to focus here on damage, healing and tanking numbers. We don't want this to be a catch all &quot;ask the blues.&quot; Ideally we'd like to see more &quot;How does this work?&quot; and less &quot;Why did you change this?&quot; (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/227466-beta-class-balance-analysis/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5889309137?page=139#2765))<br />

Monk Mistweaver Feedback<br />
<br />
Xuen is not scaling with AP converted from SP. We’re in the process of fixing this. His damage will increase significantly when completed.<br />
We agree that Rushing Jade Wind isn’t that much of a competitive choice for Mistweaver’s in that tier. We’re adding a new effect which will increase the healing done by the Monk’s Spinning Crane Kick (via Teachings of the Monastery) after cast.<br />
Revival is intended to be the Tranquility/Divine Hymn for Monks. We agree it may not be as competitive as the other healer's timers, so it’s likely we’ll do some tuning there.<br />
We’re going to be removing the cap of Renewing Mists (from 10 targets), mainly because the cooldown should be the limiter of # of active targets, not an arbitrary cap.<br />
Regarding Uplift not filling the slot of AOE healing, Spinning Crane Kick’s heal is intended to fill that gap. The healing done by SCK in the live beta build is bugged and not scaling from spellpower. We've got this fixed in a future beta patch.<br />
Regarding the melee healing monk, we'd appreciate more detail about what exactly is hampering the subspec from being viable.<br />
We agree that monks have mana issues right now, but in our tests, Mistweavers are still doing quite well. Expect healing number reductions if we do reduce mana costs and/or buff Mana Tea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, we welcome any videos + combat log parses of raid tests with Mistweavers (in both ranged healing and melee healing subspecs), if you guys have them.

Upcoming Monk Changes<br />
We agree the rotation feels slightly slower paced in entry level gear than intended.<br />
<br />
In an upcoming build we intend to increase the base Energy regeneration to 10/second, up from 8/second (and yes, this will also affect Brewmasters). We may have to follow this with some damage reductions, as monks are already performing at an optimal state in our damage tests. That said, in entry level expansion items, Energy regeneration rates are always going to feel slower than they should, because we have to tune things with future gear in mind.<br />
<br />
Regarding “cleaving” damage balance, monks in our tests are competitive on 3+ targets via Spinning Crane Kick rather than Jab in a slightly different rotation. <br />
<br />
As always, challenging us with specific numbers when outlining your case is very welcome. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/230766-ww-monk-feedback/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6079780508?page=10#182))<br />

Heroic Spine Changes After Mists of Pandaria Pre-Patch<br />
So I haven't seen this mentioned anywhere, but is anything being done to make heroic spine beatable after the nerf to dispels that are going out? Considering how rapidly you have to dispel on it, it seems impossible with the new dispell reductions.<br />
When the pre-Mists patch goes live, Blood Corruption on the Heroic Spine of Deathwing encounter will transform into the positive type after a single dispel. <br />
<br />
Somewhat related, successfully dispelling Wrack on Sinestra will reset the cooldown of the caster's dispel ability, keeping the gameplay there unchanged.

<br />
Content Difficulty and Consumption Speed<br />
Why do they have to see heroic versions of the same content, without investing at least a tenth of the work of others?<br />
Why are you assuming that it's those same players going on LFR the ones that are getting to the heroic versions now? There are players that started on normal back when the raid was released, that today are still progressing through Heroic Dragon Soul. <br />
<br />
Isn't heroic mode just for those who WANT to spend their time in heroic modes of current raids?<br />
You can't just go and put players in boxes where they'll fit nicely. There're no &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;heroic&quot; raiders. There are players. Some can (and only) want to do LFR, some others just Heroic, and some others just Normal. Sure. <br />
<br />
But there are many players that start at Normal and just keep progressing until the end, if they can make it that far. The end for them isn't at the end boss of the normal difficulty of a given tier, it is at Heroic. We already said back in the Wrath of the Lich King days that heroic (hardmode back then) bosses were considered part of your progression through each tier. And as I've mentioned on this thread several times already, the developers saw that after some time of hitting a brick wall, players will just stop trying. <br />
<br />
The dedication and consistency to actually keep bashing themselves against a very challenging encounter for extended periods of time is something that is really exclusive to the most hardcore raiders.<br />
<br />
It doesn't double the amount of content, thats merely an illusion. What it does is double the burnout and reduce the mystique of each raid instance. The brickwalls, as you call them, are probably nothing more than an average guild wiping a couple of times on a hc boss before reverting back to normal.<br />
<br />
I've seen this over and over again. 95% of the so called 'raiders' in this patch have no idea what a brick wall really is. In fact if these brick walls, were real brick walls, then the content would never have been cleared without the nerf at all would it? I assume the members of your guild are in full possession of thier faculties?<br />
You can't pretend you know better than others. You can't really tell them they have no idea what a brick wall is. Because what it might not be to you a brick wall, for others it is. For your raid dealing with Heroic Yorsahj's Yellow+Red+Black might be insanely easy. For others, even with Bloodlust, they might struggle to clear adds and keep everyone up. And probably you won't even picture how is that possible because it was never difficult for you in the first place, but the fact is... it is for others.<br />
<br />
Just give us one boss for every raidtier, an optional boss, but an insanely hard one (Sinestra was the right direction), only 0.05% of all Players shall be able to kill him (like PvP), only those 0.05% of all Players shall get an epic PvE title/mount and maybe some gear from this boss (like PvP) and with every new raidtier remove the title/mount rewards from the old one. Do this and you will win hundreds of thounds more subscribers.<br />
And by which logic having a boss that is accessible only to 0.05% of all players and removing the rewards from the previous one will make hundreds of thousands more to subscribe? Do you really think that saying to a crowd of 10,000 people, that they should subscribe because only 5 of them will ever get to see this one boss, will actually look appealing to them?<br />
<br />
Than why do you do it for PvP?<br />
I think you're mixing content with rewards. There's no content that is available only to 0.5% of the PVP players. There are rewards for them. And while it's not an exact comparison (to my knowledge) we have Realm First! achievements as well on the PVE side of things which are just as exclusive rewards as those titles. <br />
<br />
If they are motivated, then they will work to see it. If they aren't motivated, then they don't deserve to see it. It's the same as real life : if you're not motivated to have a job or a diploma, then why on earth you should have it ?<br />
Are you seriously comparing having a job, or a diploma (and the motivation to have those things), with defeating a virtual boss in a virtual world?<br />
<br />
If we follow your &quot;logic&quot;, then WHY does the Gladiator titles and mounts still exists then ? It is only reserved to 0.5% of the top best players, and they got a shiny mount and a badass title. Please tell me how this is different from the situation you're quoting.<br />
See the first part of this post. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/228883-we-consume-content-too-fast/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4879017939?page=151#3017))<br />
<br />
Too Many Levels?<br />
Guys, you're missing my point. It isn't about actual time played to get to cap, It's more about the perception of &quot;&quot;How Many??&quot;&quot;.<br />
<br />
As we know, it's been stated by Blizz that certain numbers in the game are getting a little out of hand: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3258652<br />
I think you have a good point, perceptions are a very tricky subject to deal with.<br />
<br />
Still, I think it’s important to understand where perceptions come from. I think this one in particular is very dependent on what players are accustomed to with the MMORPG genre. This is really important because WoW has been, in my opinion, constantly setting and raising the standards of what players should expect of a MMORPG game.<br />
Where I’m getting at is, this is all relative, if Vanilla had a level cap other than 60, let’s say 200, we could easily be discussing how increasing it to a number like 300 in MoP could be causing a weird perception of being “too high” of a value. <br />
<br />
I think we’re quite safe. For me, the most important thing is that we keep the proportional relation between “time spent levelling” and the increase in the level cap with each expansion somewhat consistent. <br />
With BC and WoTLK we increased the level cap by 10, so in WoTLK players already knew what to expect, but in Cataclysm it was only 5 levels, and that’s where perceptions can get a little weird because players could think “hey it’s going to take half the time”, which isn’t really true, as we can adjust many other variables like xp gained per mob/quest/dungeon and the amount of xp required per level. <br />
<br />
I think players have roughly a good idea of what to expect with the levelling pace in MoP and hopefully if anything surprises them on that regard it will only be for the best.<br />
<br />
Regarding the issue that you mentioned with the “Item Squish”, there are two things at stake there, one is perception, if values increase exponentially they will eventually look weird and hard to read.<br />
But most importantly it was and still is, a matter of hardware. A lot of players still use 32-bit computers, or at least have a 32-bit OS even if they might have a 64bit CPU. <br />
<br />
I won’t get into much detail here but from what I can remember of my microprogramming days it has to do with the amount of bits a CPU can process per cycle. Since all variables are eventually converted to a binary number at the lowest level, when you get a big enough decimal number, let’s say 2,147,483,647 we’ve just hit the limit of 32-bits for a signed number. So imagine you have a boss with a HP higher than that value, or you have a damage meter addon that is constantly adding up all the damage your raid is doing, once those values surpass that decimal number your 32-bit CPU will need 2 cycles instead of 1 to do the same calculation, thus reducing the overall performance of the game. <br />
So unless we get everyone to use 64-bit CPUs/OSes, there’s really no way around it, it will have to be dealt with somehow, whether it’s by doing an item squish or something else, only time and our dear developers will know.<br />
<br />
For MoP, you don’t have to worry about it, there won’t be any item squish (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK5b_RCH5ig). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/230693-100-levels-too-many/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4941028235?page=3#53))<br />
<br />
Should I Buy Mists of Pandaria?<br />
It will be my last year of school, I will have to get good grades like 19.2+/20. So it will be like playing 1 hour per day . Can I do a lot of things in 1 hour or leveling , gearing will be taking ages? Will I have to play the game 3 hours + to do well ?<br />
There is a lot of different content in Mists of Pandaria, and as always some things will take longer to do than other things. Having enough time available all depends on what you want to get out of the game.<br />
<br />
If you feel there is a real risk that playing the game might interfere with your studies, then I personally think that it would be best for you to wait getting the expansion until such a time when you feel that you have the time you need to play the game the way you want.<br />
<br />
The reason being I really worry that its going to be a children's expansion. This is not a criticism its just the impression I have from what I read.<br />
There is nothing wrong with being skeptical, so if you are concerned that the expansion might not be for you, then it would probably not be a bad idea to just wait and see what kind of impact Mists of Pandaria will have on World of Warcraft and the community playing it :-)<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria has a lot of grimness and gloom as well, and from what I have seen I think the expansion strikes a nice balance between the whimsical Warcraft and serious Warcraft. It still feels like World of Warcraft when playing it, so in my opinion it is not a fluffy and cuddly &quot;childrens expansion&quot;.

<br />
Does Mists of Pandaria Feel Rushed?<br />
I can't really judge whether MoP &quot;feels rushed&quot;, given how it hasn't been released yet, but I'll be sure to come back in 2/3 months time and tell you how I feel about the expansion<br />
And we look forward to hear what you, and everyone else of course, have to say by then.<br />
<br />
They still have 2 months? Doesn't seem like any magic involved there..<br />
Indeed. A release date has been announced, but that doesn't mean that Mists of Pandaria is now done and the developers are now comfortably sitting back, kicking their feet up, and taking a 2 months break. They are still hard at work making sure that Mists of Pandaria will be good and ready for launch.<br />
<br />
This of course doesn't mean that you shouldn't share your feedback if you feel that the content in the beta doesn't feel ready for launch, but please do not mistake the beta as the finished game.

Yes! People will subscribe and strive to be the very best. This is perfectly normal because it's called &quot;competition&quot;. You know... races, tournaments, contests where not everyone win.

Interesting apart from the few problems here and there the beta is very stable at the moment, more stable than it was a couple months back when it was DC city. Move an inch DC, click the UI DC, loot a mob DC, enter a dungeon DC, move the camera DC.. Currently it is lag problems in some areas..</div></div><hr />

You still don't get it do you? You just cannot get it into your head that the members of the WoW community have vastly different skill caps. A boss that .05% of all players could beat would be uninteresting for ~ 99% of the community. It's like that boss wasn't even there in the first place.<br />
.95% would still try and probably just hit their heads against a brick wall, eventually admitting their defeat and be done with it.<br />
<br />
You my dear have to learn that 99% of the community wouldn't even CARE about that boss because they know they don't stand a chance, no matter how hard they try. And that's why Blizzard only does one such boss per expansion, because designing it is essentially wasting resources that could benefit the entire player base.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
A diploma has real consequences and thus cannot be given out freely. A gimpy engineer designing a bridge or a machine would KILL people, when that bridge collapses or the machine malfunctions.<br />
<br />
Killing a raid boss IN A VIDEOGAME has no such consequences other the fact that when the true hardcores are done, other segments of the playerbase that aren't as skilled can have FUN beating a challenging encounter with a little help from Blizzard. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes whether you believe it or not, SpineHC -25% actually was challenging for my guild, we killed it in our ~150. Pull (Granted I think we started on it when the nerf was 15% or so). That is NOT 0 effort on our part. However we could NEVER have killed it in it's original form, b/c we don't have the luxury of stacking rogues and mages. We play on a low population server and recruit pretty much any available class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are either trolling, fresh after lobotomizing or just downright ignorant. <br />
<br />
I siad it's not about what is real or what is not. It is about a principle of striving and putting effort into something to get something out of it. Not about playing a game and getting rewarded in real life. You need to work on your reading comprehension at no point in my previous post I was mentioning something about cross life-virtual world relationship. I mean it as a comparison. In case if you dont know, which clearly you dont know when you compare something you compare the similarities. <br />
<br />
In my comparison I was comparing that just like in real life you put effort to gain something, just as much you should put in virtual world effort to get something in virtual world. Is it so hard to comprehand or do you need to nitpick that I offended you in this post in which case is more of fact because you showed yourself you dont know what comparison is to begin with.<br />

<br />
Experiencing the content doesnt neccesarly mean conquering the content. Would you consider a race you participate in a waste of time because you didnt won it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
.95% would still try and probably just hit their heads against a brick wall, eventually admitting their defeat and be done with it.<br />

<br />
What if entire playerbase get socially engineered to the point where directly challenging them in any way is a taboo? What if entire playerbase goes down to the point where Blizzard must dump down the game to the point of button mashing and no real playing as seen in LFR? Can you really say those people are active players when all they do is just leech on the ride?<br />
<br />
So because if they cant beat certain content it means that it is worthless? Despite they have full access to it? My cheap, you are a example of people who wish to turn gaming into a cheap puppet show that must leave you satisfied or else it's worthless.<br />

It's not about consequences it is about principles! Principles are rules and rules are what games are made of. You cant have games without rules because otherwise you end up with a mess where everyone does whatever he wants justifying it by saying &quot;but I have fun!&quot; Imagine a game of tag where no one adheres to &quot;you are it&quot; rule because &quot;it is fun for me this way&quot;.<br />

<br />
Are you for real man?<br />
<br />
It's a game, just because you and a few others, want it to be your special online olympics, doesnt mean that Blizzard will go that direction, or should for that matter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Comparing it to RL jobs and studies is just failure from the getgo.<br />
<br />
Heck I don't want to do 500lbs squats while watching Arnold schwarzenegger movies (Cus' you gotta be like arnold to watch him!)<br />
<br />
I doubt you'll understand this, but the majority of WoW players, want to play the game to relax.<br />
<br />
After a hard days work, where I pick up the kids, and cook dinner for the lot of us, play some soccer or whatever with them, and throw them to bed, I'm not going to wrap that up with logging into WoW, and get frustrated at the same boss for 5 hours straight, or throw up some &quot;lol nub casuals l2play you get no epics!&quot; attitude.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, something is wrong, if people are looking to WoW, to get their ego/challenge trip, I fully understand that some people have all day, and enjoy raiding harder bosses, and that's all fine, but in the end it has 0 purpose, you're not going to transit your Dragon slayer skills, into a new job, or girlfriend, or school, it serves no purpose other than keeping you entertained, heck you can't even make a living from doing it, all these things put it straight into 1 category, entertainment.<br />
<br />
Sure you wan't to compare it to beeing a pro footbal player, but thoose guys make a living doing what they do (and I'm sure it helps with the chicks too), I'm shocked when I see the comparison of Super athletes who spent 10+ years getting to where they are with, WoW players who's throwing down 3 liters of cola while sitting on a chair for 6 hours, doing nothing but pushing buttons and moving their mouse, it's not the same, you might aswell compare yourself to Formula 1 drivers, cus you think you're one hell of a driver in Forza 4.<br />
<br />
Just drop it, if anything Blizzard are loosing more and more respect for their dedicated raiders, due to the crazy compairons that some of them make now and then.</div></div><hr />

Would you consider a race you participate in a waste of time because you didnt won it?<br />
<br />
I would never enter a race I KNOW I have no chance of winning. Essentially it's a waste of my time. No one enjoys wiping to a boss they KNOW the can't beat.<br />
<br />
<br />
What if entire playerbase get socially engineered to the point where directly challenging them in any way is a taboo? What if entire playerbase goes down to the point where Blizzard must dump down the game to the point of button mashing and no real playing as seen in LFR?<br />
<br />
You are over exaggerating and you know it. It's not like HC - 25% = LFR. You still need to pay attention to e.g. Ultraxions Mechanics, you just don't need the crazy HPS/DPS anymore. Even in HCs - 30% I can't just smash my head on the keyboard and get loot. LFR is there to just see the content. LFR-Epics are just an incentive to let peeps run it more than once so groups will continue to form.<br />
<br />
<br />
So because if they cant beat certain content it means that it is worthless? Despite they have full access to it? My cheap, you are a example of people who wish to turn gaming into a cheap puppet show that must leave you satisfied or else it's worthless.<br />
<br />
Sunwell was worthles to me because I didn't enter it. (for various reasons). Yes. Content I can not play is worthless. I hate PvP, so every added BG or Arena is essentially worthless to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not about consequences it is about principles! Principles are rules and rules are what games are made of.<br />
<br />
The rule of the game is that you have round about 2 months to clear the content pre nerf. - If you can't do it, I just say: &quot;DEAL WITH IT.&quot;<br />
The Rule of the game in BC was that raiding Sunwell was only for the top x% of the population. - If I can't do it, that population says to me: &quot;DEAL WITH IT.&quot;<br />
<br />
Principles are funny eh? Depends on the side of the fence you're at.<br />
<br />
<br />
Create and gear up alts?<br />
<br />
No thanks. Why would I? I love my SP-Priest and I HATE mage gameplay wise. BTW: Ever heard of the term &quot;character attachment&quot;?<br />
<br />
Ultimately: WoW is no open source project. If someone doesn't like the way it's developed he can QQ. If Blizzard insists, he can just quit. Be it that he is a casual that quits b/c he can't raid or a wannabe hardcore that quits b/c he has a problem with the fact that others clear content M O N T H S after he does.... Blizzard ultimately doesn't care because the know that pleasing everyone is impossible.<br />
<br />
BTW: To make a real life comparison that actually fits the situation:<br />
You buy a computer with a certain speed today for 2000$.<br />
I buy that same computer half a year down the road for 1500$.<br />
<br />
Now you rage on about how I don't deserve that computer because I put no effort in whatsoever and that this computer should be taken away from me. <br />
You neglect the fact, that for a person who doesn't get your salaries, 1500$ is the relative same amount like 2000$ is for you.<br />

I siad it's not about what is real or what is not. It is about a principle of striving and putting effort into something to get something out of it. Not about playing a game and getting rewarded in real life. You need to work on your reading comprehension at no point in my previous post I was mentioning something about cross life-virtual world relationship. I mean it as a comparison. In case if you dont know, which clearly you dont know when you compare something you compare the similarities. <br />
<br />
In my comparison I was comparing that just like in real life you put effort to gain something, just as much you should put in virtual world effort to get something in virtual world. Is it so hard to comprehand or do you need to nitpick that I offended you in this post in which case is more of fact because you showed yourself you dont know what comparison is to begin with.<br />

<br />
Experiencing the content doesnt neccesarly mean conquering the content. Would you consider a race you participate in a waste of time because you didnt won it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and what is wrong with that?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What if entire playerbase get socially engineered to the point where directly challenging them in any way is a taboo? What if entire playerbase goes down to the point where Blizzard must dump down the game to the point of button mashing and no real playing as seen in LFR? Can you really say those people are active players when all they do is just leech on the ride?<br />
<br />
So because if they cant beat certain content it means that it is worthless? Despite they have full access to it? My cheap, you are a example of people who wish to turn gaming into a cheap puppet show that must leave you satisfied or else it's worthless.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not about consequences it is about principles! Principles are rules and rules are what games are made of. You cant have games without rules because otherwise you end up with a mess where everyone does whatever he wants justifying it by saying &quot;but I have fun!&quot; Imagine a game of tag where no one adheres to &quot;you are it&quot; rule because &quot;it is fun for me this way&quot;.<br />

<br />
So if you dont win at something it is a waste? Do you really believe winning is all that matters and everything except 1st place are losers?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You are over exaggerating and you know it. It's not like HC - 25% = LFR. You still need to pay attention to e.g. Ultraxions Mechanics, you just don't need the crazy HPS/DPS anymore. Even in HCs - 30% I can't just smash my head on the keyboard and get loot. LFR is there to just see the content. LFR-Epics are just an incentive to let peeps run it more than once so groups will continue to form.<br />
<br />
Am I? Am I really? Once upon a time it was common to do bigger DPS than tank. Once upon a time it was common to actually try first before whinning. Once upon a time, people bothered to spent those 3 hours to do those attunements rather than whinning 6 hours on forums hoping it will change. Once upon a time it was normal and not sub-optimal to go out of one's way to help someone rather than sit in SW all day. Once upon a time it was normal that if one was bad... that person stayed bad with other bads not wiping those who improve.<br />
<br />
Once upon it was actually satisfying to conquer a challenge in game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sunwell was worthles to me because I didn't enter it. (for various reasons). Yes. Content I can not play is worthless. I hate PvP, so every added BG or Arena is essentially worthless to me.<br />
<br />
Is it still worthless now? There's nothing that stands in your way to go there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The rule of the game is that you have round about 2 months to clear the content pre nerf. - If you can't do it, I just say: &quot;DEAL WITH IT.&quot;<br />
The Rule of the game in BC was that raiding Sunwell was only for the top x% of the population. - If I can't do it, that population says to me: &quot;DEAL WITH IT.&quot;<br />
<br />
and nothing was wrong with that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Principles are funny eh? Depends on the side of the fence you're at.<br />
<br />
They are not so hard to live up to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No thanks. Why would I? I love my SP-Priest and I HATE mage gameplay wise. BTW: Ever heard of the term &quot;character attachment&quot;?<br />
That's your self inflicted limitation. That's your problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ultimately: WoW is no open source project. If someone doesn't like the way it's developed he can QQ. If Blizzard insists, he can just quit. Be it that he is a casual that quits b/c he can't raid or a wannabe hardcore that quits b/c he has a problem with the fact that others clear content M O N T H S after he does.... Blizzard ultimately doesn't care because the know that pleasing everyone is impossible.<br />
<br />
Then they better admit it publicly because their statement of &quot;We want to make a game for everyone&quot; is still not officially recalled. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW: To make a real life comparison that actually fits the situation:<br />
You buy a computer with a certain speed today for 2000$.<br />
I buy that same computer half a year down the road for 1500$.<br />
<br />
Now you rage on about how I don't deserve that computer because I put no effort in whatsoever and that this computer should be taken away from me. <br />
You neglect the fact, that for a person who doesn't get your salaries, 1500$ is the relative same amount like 2000$ is for you.<br />
<br />
Your comparison would hold true if at the same time I could get even better PC than that 1500$ which was once worth 2000$. But the thing is there's none. Just like in WoW now, there's no real recognition for doing HC DS without buff, there's simply none. And if you want people to do something you cant just hope on their &quot;will for challenge&quot; alone, this is why such thing called &quot;incentive&quot; exists.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you see now how utterly ridiculous the claims of these wannabe-hardcores are?<br />
The only thing ridiculous here is your convieninet comparison which I corrected just now.<br />

Yes Im for real<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a game, just because you and a few others, want it to be your special online olympics, doesnt mean that Blizzard will go that direction, or should for that matter.<br />
Thing is that we dont want to change the entire game upside down as most of your kind believes. All some are asking is proper recognition for those who choose it the hard way. It wont devalue or hurt anyone. Is it so much to ask?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Comparing it to RL jobs and studies is just failure from the getgo.<br />
If you keep missing my point about &quot;principles&quot; that is. But ok here's a other example of a different &quot;game&quot; that should make sense to you. Game of tags, everyone should adhere to &quot;You're it&quot; rule but someone like you shows up, deny it and call &quot;I want to play the game to relax&quot;. See my point now?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt you'll understand this, but the majority of WoW players, want to play the game to relax.<br />
I do understand this, but the problem is some people's &quot;relax&quot; gets in the way of others.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After a hard days work, where I pick up the kids, and cook dinner for the lot of us, play some soccer or whatever with them, and throw them to bed, I'm not going to wrap that up with logging into WoW, and get frustrated at the same boss for 5 hours straight, or throw up some &quot;lol nub casuals l2play you get no epics!&quot; attitude.<br />
<br />
Fine by me if you stay close to your casual content which is suited for you. Heroics should be suited for you. There's a reason they are called heroics to begin with.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, something is wrong, if people are looking to WoW, to get their ego/challenge trip, I fully understand that some people have all day, and enjoy raiding harder bosses, and that's all fine, but in the end it has 0 purpose, you're not going to transit your Dragon slayer skills, into a new job, or girlfriend, or school, it serves no purpose other than keeping you entertained, heck you can't even make a living from doing it, all these things put it straight into 1 category, entertainment.<br />
<br />
And nothing is wrong with that so what's your point? That leisure time should have no standards and should do random things without cause because social stigma says so?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure you wan't to compare it to beeing a pro footbal player, but thoose guys make a living doing what they do (and I'm sure it helps with the chicks too), I'm shocked when I see the comparison of Super athletes who spent 10+ years getting to where they are with, WoW players who's throwing down 3 liters of cola while sitting on a chair for 6 hours, doing nothing but pushing buttons and moving their mouse, it's not the same, you might aswell compare yourself to Formula 1 drivers, cus you think you're one hell of a driver in Forza 4.<br />
<br />
Great generalization there mate. Once agian... it's not about what is real and what is not. Do you have problems with reading comprehension? It is about &quot;principles&quot; a principle where you get better at a game and get rewarded for better peformance is a good quality leisure time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just drop it, if anything Blizzard are loosing more and more respect for their dedicated raiders, due to the crazy compairons that some of them make now and then.<br />
<br />
And they could easily fix it by adding such simple things likes seperate hardcore servers where nerfs never apply or achievements for doing bosses without the debuff to provide incentive for doing the hard way. Thankfully they finally do this in form of challenge modes and specific achievements for bosses without buff (only final ones though which boggles my mind) which I could best describe as:<br />

Please don't try to act stupid now, I know you re not. We're talking about binary outcomes here.<br />
It's a raid boss. It either dies or it does not die. It dying is rewarded, it not dying is punished. Yes it IS a waste of time to wipe if you mathematically don't stand a chance.<br />

Yes because it's not about what real and what is not (this counter argument is getting old btw and it always misses the point).

I totally agree with him there. If not, they could just send us the newest Tier via mail upon patch release. Now that would be one hell of a boring game to play. You have to put effort in EVERY game. Even if you just play the Crysis 2 solo player campaign.<br />
<br />
The amount of effort you put into a game should be recognized at some level. In Crysis 2 you advance in the story in a multi player game you get points in MMOs you get stuff others don't have.<br />
The wish to have that stuff creates the drive to play a dungeon multiple times in the first place.<br />
<br />
The amount of &quot;work&quot; must be carefully balanced though, that peeps are not encouraged to lose their entire life in a game to get that one thing they want.<br />
<br />
<br />

Thing is that this is the constant anwser whenever the game lowers it's challenge agian and agian and agian rather than staying the same so it wouldnt be subjective anymore. That would be nice dont you think?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are rules. You don't like them, but the rules are there.<br />

Rules of common courtesy? Sorry... no place for that, my ilvl is more important.<br />

I totally agree with him there. If not, they could just send us the newest Tier via mail upon patch release. Now that would be one hell of a boring game to play. You have to put effort in EVERY game. Even if you just play the Crysis 2 solo player campaign.<br />
<br />
The amount of effort you put into a game should be recognized at some level. In Crysis 2 you advance in the story in a multi player game you get points in MMOs you get stuff others don't have.<br />
The wish to have that stuff creates the drive to play a dungeon multiple times in the first place.<br />
<br />
The amount of &quot;work&quot; must be carefully balanced though, that peeps are not encouraged to lose their entire life in a game to get that one thing they want.<br />
<br />
<br />
However I resent the notion that someone killing a boss easier than you half a year later devalues your efforts. It's just not so.<br />
<br />
I see we agree here so I guess it's best If I seal it with why I think it does devalue someone's effort. Also sorry in for any rage I induced in you.<br />
While it is true that It's not entirely accurate that your efforts are completly devalued as there's such a thing as time stamp, it's without a doubt a clear proof that someone did a content without buff or part of current one. However... It's hardly visible and noticable, nobody really points it out unless it is very visible like World First or Realm First to certain extent. Because of that post buff kills are hardly distinguishable from post buff kills without buff.<br />
<br />
Some people including me do not like it. As such I very often adhere to the idea of seperate no buffed achievement to distinguish those who did it in it's original form without any kind of help. It's also not in a &quot;I want to rub it in your face&quot; hostile manner but &quot;Hey! look at this! Try this if you're up to it&quot; friendly manner. I do not wish for competetion driven by jealosy and feeling of inferiority, however many people seem to recieve it only in the latter mentioned way, which saddens me really because we could do better than that.<br />
<br />
So suma sumarum:<br />
Yes... in theory buffed kills do not devalue non-buffed kills, however it is directly opposite in practice.<br />

Perhaps you misunderstand, it's not about putting effort into it -- it's putting as much effort into it as you do into real life. That's what I have a big problem with.<br />
<br />
How can you really distinguish who puts how much effort into both things. Personally I think people find real life effort bigger simply because it's real but not because it's bigger. If anything real life effort is more stressful because of its consequences of failing rather then it being fundamentally more hard. Here's an example:<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Excel_chart.PNG<br />
You dont know whether it is about rogue DPS build up curve or a very important graph showing valuable data you need in your finacial company.<br />
<br />
Without knowing whether this curve shows this or that can you judge how much effort you need to learn it or gather data from it?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Granyala</div><div class="date">2012-07-27, 03:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about gamers change over time by improving? That worked back in the day and nobody was whining.<br />
<br />
2 Problems:<br />
<br />
1) Blizzard would actually have to present the gamers with a learning CURVE, which they never got right, because it takes a lot of design effort. <br />
Right now you have:<br />
-Faceroll leveling<br />
-Faceroll 5mans<br />
-Faceroll Heroic 5mans (Twilight ones)<br />
-Faceroll normal mode (My Guild cleared DS nomral in 2-3 IDs. Remember thats the same guild that needs the 25% debuff for spineHC, we are most certainly NOT hardcore in any sense of the word)<br />
- HARD Heroic raids. (I think we can agree on the fact that w/o debuff DS25 HC is pretty hard)<br />
<br />
People learn incremental. Sometimes these increments are so small that the learning person doesn't even realize that it's improving. People (unless in extreme cases, faced with death or something) never learn in huge leaps. Yet huge leaps is what Blizzard expects in the transition from normal 25man to heroic 25man.<br />
<br />
2) Many players don't want to learn to be good. Blizzard wants to keep these players subscribed to make a profit. -&gt; Game has to be nerfed to get these peeps stuff to do so they continue to pay.<br />
<br />
It's nothing personal, it's just business.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because of that post buff kills are hardly distinguishable from post buff kills without buff.<br />
Some people including me do not like it. As such I very often adhere to the idea of seperate no buffed achievement to distinguish those who did it in it's original form without any kind of help<br />
<br />
Agreed. The &quot;doing it w/o buff&quot; not being recognized in any way (not even date after the buff went live) is a lame move from Blizzard, it already was a lame move back in the days of ICC. Peeps should be rewarded somehow for doing it &quot;uphill in snow barefoot both ways&quot;. If it's not with gear, it should be with achievements, hell that's the entire point of the stupid achievement system, to be able to reward players with other stuff than epics. (Not sure, but I think Achievements like these are in Beta?)<br />
<br />
<br />
It's also not in a &quot;I want to rub it in your face&quot; hostile manner but &quot;Hey! look at this! Try this if you're up to it&quot; friendly manner. I do not wish for competetion driven by jealosy and feeling of inferiority, however many people seem to recieve it only in the latter mentioned way, which saddens me really because we could do better than that.<br />
<br />
That's a nice sentiment. Honestly. I personally wouldn't be challenged by it, but I also wouldn't be jealous. It's just me, I'm not a person who seeks challenges. I don't study engineering to challenge myself I study b/c I'm curious about technology. Same with WoW.<br />
<br />
Sure, I want a boss to be reasonably hard. I hate LFR because the boss dies in the first pull. I still remember Yogg saron fondly. First times we were there he basically just said: &quot;Well nice try, here are your asses, now GET OFF MY LAWN!&quot; <br />
But I also want to be sure that my group CAN defeat a boss. If that's not the case, my motivation to progress on that boss is zero. zip. (e.g.: Setup, imagine you need 5 rogues minimum and you only have one in your guild, attempting that boss would be futile)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also sorry in for any rage I induced in you.<br />
<br />
Naah no rage at all. I just love heated discussions. If I offended you or came over as furious I apologize. English is, as you probably already noticed, not my native language. ^_^<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps you misunderstand, it's not about putting effort into it -- it's putting as much effort into it as you do into real life. That's what I have a big problem with.<br />
Just like content difficulty, the amount of effort perceived is entirely subjective. <br />
E.g.: Rolling alts for freak setups may be too much for peeps like me, but for others it's just a natural thing to do in order to overcome a challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bigger problem is, the community doesn't help new players/bad players. In a game such as this, players are supposed to help each other learn and grow. Hence the term community. Problem is, the game is full of assholes and pricks. Usually when players see someone who doesn't know what they're doing, they rail against that player and make him/her feel like shit. I was lucky in that I've met some wonderful fellow warriors who guided my hand and helped me get better. Honestly, nowadays, I see someone complain about players who do poorly or don't know things, I automatically assume that guy has never bothered to help and mentor others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because I do not warrant gaming as being comparable to real life does not mean I believe it &quot;child's play&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Focus less on the &quot;flaws&quot; of the analogy and more on anwsering the question which follows it.<br />
<br />
Analogies are always flawed and fall short. Personally, I can't stand them anymore because they can be twisted back and forth, every which way (you and I have both seen this happen many, many times). I believe that arguments should stick to the specific point without using such examples.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thing is that this is the constant anwser whenever the game lowers it's challenge agian and agian and agian rather than staying the same so it wouldnt be subjective anymore. That would be nice dont you think?<br />
<br />
The real challenge for hardcores lies in beating bosses before they're nerfed. To me, that's what the challenge is. It doesn't lessen their achievement. If they have a problem with others beating it at a later date with not as much effort, well...you know, I don't know why there's a focus on what other people are doing. To make sense, it should be about their own personal experience...want the challenge, then turn off the debuff. You can argue as much as you want about how that's unreasonable, but that's the fact. The impetus is on the player to make that challenge. To make things worse, I've heard as a rebuttal, &quot;Why would I make things more difficult for me if I don't have to??&quot;- which makes me want to pull my hair out. I mean, isn't that what you're saying? That you want it more difficult or challenging? The statement just undermines their whole argument.<br />
<br />
I will and have before, however, concede that there is lacking a real motivating factor to do so, and that's a problem. I find it strange that some achievement, even if it's just a Feat of Strength, hasn't been added to encourage attempting something without the debuff...so, I do hear where you're coming from at least in that regard.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a serious note. Do you know of any rules that keeps WoW community good and aspirant to greater challenge? Because I'm either blind or deaf and cant see them at all.<br />
<br />
I wish there was a way to regulate behavior, but that's difficult enough to do in real life. In a virtual world with anonymity, it's virtually impossible. lol. Ah, I crack myself up.<br />
<br />
No, I've played with some folks at times who literally just suck. I'm not going to call them out for it or anything. I mean, they're playing to have fun and far be it from me to make someone feel bad in a video game...though, on rare occasions, I've had to take some action if I'm leading a raid because they're a detriment to the others who are pulling their weight.<br />
<br />
Of course, there's a point where that &quot;greater challenge&quot; can only go so far until the next patch...and, to be honest, I believe that the debuffs do inspire more players, though lesser skilled, to aspire to a greater challenge. I don't believe they would even attempt them with nerfs, and it assists to help them learn mechanics they should've learned, you know, in the previous patch (new players/raiders just entering the experience are a rare exception). The ones who really suck still are not going to be able to beat them (unless we're talking Morchok, but I consider that an anomaly). I believe without the nerfs, many wouldn't even attempt it.<br />
<br />
Still, there should be a motivating factor implemented to do attempts with the nerfs.<br />
<br />
On another note, I believe these new challenge modes will be interesting to see how they turn out, and have high hopes something similar will be implemented with raiding. Don't argue those modes be nerfed. Arguments those will be nerfed do not hold muster unless that actually occurs. IF that does occur, then yes, we do have a serious problem Houston.<br />

Maybe this will make it more clear.<br />
<br />
If you don't put effort into real life -- you may starve, end up homeless, without a thing to your name or any number of bad things that will affect your actual quality of living.<br />
<br />
If you don't put effort into a video game, you might wipe on a boss or offend a friend or make someone you don't know angry.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying at all you should not put effort into playing the game. I'm saying not AS MUCH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a very incorrect argument when used within the MMO Genre. In a Single Player game that is more balanced around skill than gear, yes, gamers change over time by improving. A player that is unable to defeat a boss in Dark Souls would, in theory, be able to defeat the boss after a number of attempts as individually he is becoming better at the game with each attempt.<br />
<br />
In an MMO, especially one like WoW that is heavily gear heavy, this same principle rarely replies. Just because I can handle the mechanics or gear check of a boss does not mean everyone else in the raid can. That means that I won't be able to progress without leaving my raid for another, or waiting for the others to catch up, if ever.<br />
<br />
This is why the nerfs are implemented: So players can continue to raid with an established guild of friends without feeling like they have to leave them for a guild that's more capable of clearing the content.<br />
<br />
<br />
I rest my case then. God forbid if gaming evolves into anything more then stress sponge.<br />
<br />
But the question is why should it? Why should the entire gaming genre completely turn into a hard core, competitive, non-relaxing hobby. That would be like telling every person who plays sports recreationaly to relieve stress that they can't do that anymore, and must play them only competitively in order to prevent the sport from becoming stagnant.<br />
<br />
But here's the thing, and it works in WoW too: If you want to play the game for a challenge or competitively, you have that option. Turn off the Nerf in Dragon Soul, and prove to your server you can clear it without needing the nerf. This will become a lot more prevalent in Mists when you're rewarded a Feat of Strength for doing it (because for some ridiculous reason people need to have little stamps to show off that they did something).<br />
<br />
When a nerf can be toggled on or off by the player, there is zero reason to not put it in the game for those that don't care about the competitive aspect of PvE and simply want to finish the content through it's three tiers. And as the blue poster has stated several times, and people like you and others can't grasp: Why the hell do you care if someone finishes a heroic dungeon at a 30% nerf when you can do it without one?<br />
<br />
If you answer: &quot;Because it takes away my feeling of accomplishment&quot;, than you aren't playing for the competitive nature or challenge of the game, you're playing to gloat yourself over others.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh yeah I forgot... Gaming is not allowed to be more then child's play because that wouldn't feel like with someone and whoever dares to do so otherwise deserves medical treatment... silly me.<br />
<br />
*Sigh* No one is saying that. You're putting words in your mouth to try to prove your point. What people are saying, and rightfully so, is that not everyone wants to play a game that has an extreme amount of challenge in it, and some people enjoy the option of turning the difficulty down so they can play through the content.<br />
<br />
And no, your response of &quot;Oh lol they have LFR&quot; again doesn't work in WoW. In a single player game sure, if a game has three difficulties, and a person finishes it on Easy, that can be it. They can play Normal and Hard later if they want, but that's for a personal challenge and nothing more.<br />
<br />
The problem with WoW is that the higher difficulties award better gear (and aren't slight upgrades) to continue the progression of one's character. Some people (myself not being one of them, but I can understand the desire) like to continually progress their character. Hitting a solid wall in progression of that character becomes frustrating and un-enjoyable, and often times leads to people un-subbing, which is what the Blue Poster is trying to explain to people that don't want to accept that.<br />
<br />
But again: Why do you care if people are getting high-end gear for less &quot;work&quot; than you did? You still finished the content before anyone else did, you still have that knowledge, and that should be enough. I was the first person in the US to finish Mega Man 9 (atleast according to the end-game rankings, I was ranked #1 on completion time over the staff names in the ranking screen) when it released on the Wii back in 2009. I didn't take a picture of it at the time to prove I did so, but I know I finished it first, and that was enough for me.<br />
<br />
Why is it, than, that you can't accept other people are finishing content and getting the same rewards you are MUCH later on in the tier's life cycle. How does that even directly affect you? <br />
<br />
The answer is: It does not, and there is zero logical rebuttal to this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for this (not) prestigious award. I shall put it next to my English Filology certificate I have recently achieved. Yes indeed... god forbid game dare to challenge people and reward for taking the challenge because otherwise you are considered a zombie by the mainstream.<br />
<br />
The game does. You're rewarded with the fact that you've finished the content before anyone else, have the gear before anyone else, and come Mists of Pandaria, will have the FoS before anyone else for finishing the content without nerfs.<br />
<br />
What you're asking is that those rewards remain mutually exclusive to you and you only. And that is something Blizzard wont, nor ever should, do. <br />
<br />
Even using your ridiculous example of a diploma in comparison to WoW raiding, this still applies. You may get your diploma in college before someone else you know because you are smarter than they are in that subject . But that person can and will get their diploma as well through the use of tutors and extra help to allow them to pass their classes and requirements to obtain one(the equivalent to raid nerfs in this example).<br />
<br />
But according to you, because you got your diploma without a tutor, that person should be forced to do that as well, because if they use a tutor to help them get a diploma, it diminishes the fact that you got yours without one, right?</div></div><hr />

How can you really distinguish who puts how much effort into both things. Personally I think people find real life effort bigger simply because it's real but not because it's bigger. If anything real life effort is more stressful because of its consequences of failing rather then it being fundamentally more hard. Here's an example:<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Excel_chart.PNG<br />
You dont know whether it is about rogue DPS build up curve or a very important graph showing valuable data you need in your finacial company.<br />
<br />
Without knowing whether this curve shows this or that can you judge how much effort you need to learn it or gather data from it?<br />
<br />
Effort: A conscious exertion of power : hard work.<br />
<br />
I'm not personally judging how much effort they're putting into it, but if they are consciously exerting more power into determining whether their rogue DPS build up curve is adequate rather than exerting that energy toward interpreting the valuable data in their financial company ... then yes, that is a serious problem.<br />
<br />
Effort is not just an exertion of power, it's a conscious exertion of power. You know how much effort you're putting into something. If you're putting that effort more toward a video game than you are in your actual life -- and again, this is a conscious thing you're doing -- then perhaps some serious soul searching is needed.</div></div><hr />

Yeah right. Almost every time I tried to help a newbie in a friendly way I just get told:<br />

Eventually you just stop trying to give advice, and I am not the only one. Today, you just kick said person b/c discussion is futile. Most gimpy players of today think they're perfect demigods. They need the GAME tell them not to err, not other players.<br />

When a friend is dragging other behind it is in best interest of both of you to tell it out straight out as soon as you can.

When a nerf can be toggled on or off by the player, there is zero reason to not put it in the game for those that don't care about the competitive aspect of PvE and simply want to finish the content through it's three tiers. And as the blue poster has stated several times, and people like you and others can't grasp: Why the hell do you care if someone finishes a heroic dungeon at a 30% nerf when you can do it without one?<br />
<br />
Because there is no incentive to do so and some dont want to be associated with them. Thankfully this is fixed in MoP with FoS no buff achievements.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you answer: &quot;Because it takes away my feeling of accomplishment&quot;, than you aren't playing for the competitive nature or challenge of the game, you're playing to gloat yourself over others.<br />
<br />
and by that kind of gloat I dont want to send &quot;In your face scrubs!&quot; negative message but possitive &quot;Hey! look at me! How about you rise to the challenge&quot;. But that in the end falls down to whether someone wants to see it this way or the other. For whatever reason this generation reacts negatively towards other who are better then himself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*Sigh* No one is saying that. You're putting words in your mouth to try to prove your point. What people are saying, and rightfully so, is that not everyone wants to play a game that has an extreme amount of challenge in it, and some people enjoy the option of turning the difficulty down so they can play through the content.<br />
<br />
Your message could be hardly interprated otherwise. and yes I'm fine with that! As long as those who want to put it to higher gears are seperated and recognized for doing so.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And no, your response of &quot;Oh lol they have LFR&quot; again doesn't work in WoW. In a single player game sure, if a game has three difficulties, and a person finishes it on Easy, that can be it. They can play Normal and Hard later if they want, but that's for a personal challenge and nothing more.<br />
<br />
Why not? WoW has in fact 3 difficulties and it's up for personal challenge and incentive to do so. What makes WoW exception?<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem with WoW is that the higher difficulties award better gear (and aren't slight upgrades) to continue the progression of one's character. Some people (myself not being one of them, but I can understand the desire) like to continually progress their character. Hitting a solid wall in progression of that character becomes frustrating and un-enjoyable, and often times leads to people un-subbing, which is what the Blue Poster is trying to explain to people that don't want to accept that.<br />
Well if they want the goodies I think they should do what's neccesary to get them. It's a conflict between principle of aspiring up to the challenge and between &quot;I wanna&quot; attitude. Personally I dont like this and I'd preffer if those who want to get something better should support it with more then just &quot;gimme or I'll unsubscribe&quot;. Alas if Blizzard decides to catter to them then fine but as long as they give recognition and incentive to those who decide to do it the hardway then I wont have any problems with that. Thankfully... MoP fixes it.<br />
<br />
<br />
But again: Why do you care if people are getting high-end gear for less &quot;work&quot; than you did? You still finished the content before anyone else did, you still have that knowledge, and that should be enough. I was the first person in the US to finish Mega Man 9 (atleast according to the end-game rankings, I was ranked #1 on completion time over the staff names in the ranking screen) when it released on the Wii back in 2009. I didn't take a picture of it at the time to prove I did so, but I know I finished it first, and that was enough for me.<br />
Well some people are not so easily satisfied. This alone is not enough to make people aspire to get better in game. People need incentive for doing things the hardway otherwise no one will pick the hard way and that will affect negative as a whole. I dont think anyone can say with a straight face that better players are bad for the community (arrogant yes... but that's good player went wrong so to speak).<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is it, than, that you can't accept other people are finishing content and getting the same rewards you are MUCH later on in the tier's life cycle. How does that even directly affect you? <br />
In affects me in such a way that the recognition I get from doing it the hard way is non existant and even if I did it for self satisfaction it still rubbs me odd when I see other getting the same and hear them asking &quot;why did you wasted your time and didnt just waited for the nerfs&quot;. In the end this just puts me in the same bag as them and any kind of aspiration to do better than others simply falls down as waste of effort. Aspiration alone is not enough, you need an incentive.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The answer is: It does not, and there is zero logical rebuttal to this.<br />
Yes there is. Look above.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The game does. You're rewarded with the fact that you've finished the content before anyone else, have the gear before anyone else, and come Mists of Pandaria, will have the FoS before anyone else for finishing the content without nerfs.<br />
That's hardly a reward. Point of the reward is to be noticable to show others that you did achieve something. If there's no visable trophy that you did indeed managed something then we might as well all start lying to ourselves. Self satisfaction alone is not always enough. Recognition, and I mean possitive recognition as in &quot;Hey! this guy went over the top! Let's chase him!&quot; is a good thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you're asking is that those rewards remain mutually exclusive to you and you only. And that is something Blizzard wont, nor ever should, do. <br />
No... I never asked for exclusive rewards avaible only to me. I ask for exclusive rewards for all those who choose doing something the hard way. MoP finally fixes this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Even using your ridiculous example of a diploma in comparison to WoW raiding, this still applies. You may get your diploma in college before someone else you know because you are smarter than they are in that subject . But that person can and will get their diploma as well through the use of tutors and extra help to allow them to pass their classes and requirements to obtain one(the equivalent to raid nerfs in this example).<br />
<br />
If it's noticable that I did something alone and I am not put in same cattegory as those who did it with aid. I dont mind, but if I'm put in the same league as those who did the same with help and treated the same then I have a problem with that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But according to you, because you got your diploma without a tutor, that person should be forced to do that as well, because if they use a tutor to help them get a diploma, it diminishes the fact that you got yours without one, right?<br />
<br />
If I am treated the same as he... yes then that is a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;STFU Nerd, I play how I want to! You have no RL anyway, loser.&quot;<br />
<br />
Eventually you just stop trying to give advice, and I am not the only one. Today, you just kick said person b/c discussion is futile. Most gimpy players of today think they're perfect demigods. They need the GAME tell them not to err, not other players.<br />
<br />
<br />
And that's not right either. What about the person who desperately wants help, but then sees situations like what you describe, and clams up for fear of being mistreated? I know from personal experience that there are people willing to learn and grow, but they're not getting any help and are scared to ask questions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are very very well written tutorials for every class in the official wow forum. They are far better written than I could explain it on the fly. If people are unwilling to learn there nothing you can do about it.<br />
<br />
And of course, I also had peeps that were happy about help, but sadly these are the minority. The mentality of today is &quot;Well boss dead, loot there, nothing else matters&quot;. They don't see anymore that they were carried. They don't want to see. <br />
<br />
I don't know but it usually bugs the hell out of me if another player does better. I always ask him &quot;Hey how do you do that?&quot; And usually I get nice advice.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Harazi</div><div class="date">2012-07-27, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yea, and those tutorials only help so much. I'm not afraid to say, that after reading tutorials (on the WoW forums, on these forums, on EJ), I still had to go on my own realm and say out loud, Can any fellow warriors help me understand this? And even then, I'll prolly never touch the coattails of warriors in the top end guilds, even with all the time and study I put in. <br />
<br />
And while Blizz could put in quests to help people play better, how would they go about doing it? It'd be one thing to teach environment awareness and movement (beat so many mobs without ever getting hit/standing in this ability, something like that), but how would you teach people in game, proper rotation, cooldown usage, trinket usage, what abilities are best in certain situations, so on and so forth? It couldn't be automated (can't think of a better word) like a quest line, and even then, you'd be creating dozens of quest lines for dozens of specs. You kinda need people standing on the side saying, &quot;Ok, A and B are fine, C was lil off ... No no no, here, D needs to be used here, only here.&quot; So on and so forth.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dvaldin</div><div class="date">2012-07-27, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, the tutorials never did me much good either, but they did help me establish a basic rotation. Eventually, I figured out macros, but the ones online didn't fit my style, so i created my own. While it didn't put me at the top of the meters, it significantly -- and I mean, significantly -- improved my performance. Every so often, someone would even ask if I minded a tip, which I always took and implemented. Got to say that not once did any of those tips fail to further my performance.<br />
<br />
It's really all up to the individual player in the end, but without the help of others, the player will fall short. I'd never skip offering advice because I'm concerned about the response. Sure, I've been told STFU and what-have-you too, but more often it's a fairly pleasant encounter.<br />
<br />
The thing that really irks me more is taking time to offer advice to someone who I may be running regularly with, checking their stats the next week and finding them the same and them telling me they're getting around to it, and checking the third week and finding nothing has changed again. At that point, I think I've been more reasonable that a lot of people would've been, and decline to run with them anymore. Can still be social, but....ugh.</div></div><hr />

At the moment, they hit a brick wall and then immediately see it nerfed to the ground without any chance to improve their gameplay. The way they are nerfing at the moment just means that in the future more and more nerfs will be added because Blizzard is essentially not allowing the majority of the player base to learn how to play their own game.<br />
<br />
I agree with this message. The nerf policy is self defeating - if you keep lowering the bar people dont learn to get over it so when the next tier of raiding comes along the bar goes back up and they are back where they started. It makes the next tier seem harsher thus perpetuating the problem. <br />
<br />
There are 3 skill levels in this game so no one is excluded, Blizzard should just let people enjoy the content and solve the puzzle themselves.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">morfraen</div><div class="date">2012-07-28, 12:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">At least Blizzard has come out and officially declared their stance on the subject: People who won't for whatever reason put forth any effort are entitled to the same rewards as anyone else and if they can't jump the hurdles to get to the finish line, the the line will be moved and the hurdles lowered for them so they can collect their purples. Nobody is allowed to fail, because people who fail at the game then quit the game and that hurts the bottom line.<br />
<br />
That's what it's really about isn't it? Getting something for nothing. Not 'experiencing the content' but expecting to log in for 15 minutes a week and be handed the same rewards as everyone else regardless of aptitude.<br />
<br />
At least someone gets it. It sucks to see what was once a great game catering only to the lowest common denominator instead of encouraging players to aim higher.<br />
<br />
Reward without effort is meaningless. It's not fun, or enjoyable, or satisfying in any way. Without challenge WoW is nothing but a never ending grind against RNG to pointlessly fill in every slot on your paper doll.</div></div><hr />

...that's all that WoW ever was anyway. All those fancy epics you have? Useless come next expansion. Requiring the effort to once again, dive back in for another grab at shiny gear until the next tier, where you have to do it again, the tier after that, where you do it again, and then a few more tiers until all of it is made useless again as the next expansion comes out. This has been the nature of WoW, and, really, any game that progresses in tiers and expansions, the entire time.<br />
<br />
So all that's really changed is that they've shortened the time you get to kick back and say &quot;lol, I'm done.&quot; between expansions, sitting on your imagined pedestal as, previously, the unwashed masses pilfered around in their heroic blues, unaware of the world forever out of their reach, and content to sit in their squalor. Now, however, these &quot;unwashed masses&quot; have purple gear. It isn't nearly as good as yours, and doesn't let them do as many things, but... IT'S PURPLE! And, low and behold, people that previously had purples, and who you thought perhaps &quot;deserved&quot; purples (though they weren't quite as good as yours) now have the ability, with some external help, to perhaps obtain some of the purples you did, and, perhaps a few weeks or a month down the line, get an achievement for doing something tricky. Unthinkable! Unheard of! Sure, you earned it first, got achievements first, have time stamps to prove it, and KNOW that you earned these things first, but you're at a loss for how to make other people care. Suddenly, your pedestal isn't tall enough! Your world is falling apart! You're having to share it after being able to lord above others on it for five months! You can't go on...<br />

A key misunderstanding you and many other people seem to have is that it is only hardcores and wannabe who are arguing for less nerfs and tiered content. Hardcores have always cleared things pre-nerf and you're right, for them current raiding has just shortened to time they get to say &quot;lol, I'm done between expansions.&quot; Problem is, for casuals it has dramatically increased that time. I've never cared where the people above me are or where the people below me are, I only care about where I am and I've always been casual. I would appreciate the opportunity to clear through the content at my own pace and not have my pace artificially increased by nerfs and tier skipping. If I'm on firelands and other people are on DS I honestly don't care, that's just more content for me to do. The next boss to clear in firelands should mean as much to me as the next boss other people need to clear in DS means to them. All nerfing the content does and pushing me to the next tier does is make me get to that time between patches faster where there is nothing to do. You say harcores shouldn't care about people doing it on easier difficulty but I care about not having the opportunity to progress through content at the original difficulty at my own. You can say I can turn the buff off, but it's a multiplayer game, do you know how impossible it is to get a group to take the path of more resistance, especially when there is no reward for doing so and they are competing against other guilds who are using the buff? If it was a single player game I would turn off the buff but that's just not an option. All I want is for Blizzard to enough incentive such as mounts or titles that the path of least resistance and most resistance are both equally valid options so people can pick one instead of being forced into the path of least resistance. <br />
<br />
In The Burning Crusade when people had to go through one tier to get to the next, no one cared that their were people in a higher tier than them, they hadn't finished the one they were on yet, the content they were working on was just as valid to them as the content other people were working on. Okay, they never saw the last tiers until they were in the next expansion and overgeared and overleveled it, but now everyone skips the early content and doesn't get to see it until achievements run where they overgear and overlevel it, which is a bigger problem since in BC you always had the option to work your way to the higher tiers but now no one has the option to find a group that will go through an old raid in the appropriate gear. In the current system many of the least skilled casuals don't even get the opportunity to kill an end boss while it's current content. In BC it may have taken all expansion but people felt great when they cleared Kara and it was still considered current content even while other people were on black temple. Now these people would constantly be getting pushed to the next tier half way through the old one or have their progress made less meaningful by nerfs. Would it really be so hard to add herald of the titans style attunements to all older tiers so that there is enough incentive to get groups going for the older content and find groups to work through the tiers as intended. And you know what else, at the end of the expansion no one except the hardcores had run out of content, there was stuff people were working on right up until WotLK. Attunements were a shit system but tiered progression wasn't. The only problems with it were finding groups at your level of play with how fragmented the playerbase was or trying to catch up if you had friends in a higher tier. I think both paths should be available the current path of skipping tiers and nerfed content, and the old path of going through the tiers in the right order at the right gear level without nerfs, and to make this possible Blizzard needs to add incentives so that people can actually find groups willing to do the things the harder way. A timestamp on an acievement is not pushing anyone to do anything, and regardless the reward for doing harder content shouldn't have a time limit to achieve it, there should be a way for casuals to go through the same difficulty of content in more time and still get something for their effort, Turning off the buff doesn't even give any rewards. It's not the hardcores arguing for a change, it's casuals who are angry about the speed they are forced to clear content and how they are forced to skip content while Blizzard insists that its what is best for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just so you know. Imagine a game where someone introduces it to you by &quot;Here... you can be better then everyone else but there's no point to it because nobody will give a damn about it. Instead, why wont you just approach to it with half assed effort and be a shiny example of degenerating in human possibilities to the point where what once was a standard now is a luxury&quot;. Example: a goalkeeper who actually tries to defend the goal post, by today standard... that's his most basic role... in future with this attitude however... &quot;OMG! I didnt knew goalkeeper can be more then 3rd pole!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also &quot;it was a damn video game&quot; argument is getting really iritating. So what? Because it's just a game, it cant be more then a child's play otherwise something is wrong with it? Does gaming doesnt deserve to be anything more then a stress sponge? Thank god for Koreans and their SC attitude. Thankfully adleast 1 subculture in the entire world outgrew this mindset.</div></div><hr />
