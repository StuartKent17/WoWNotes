Shinies! Creating Shiny New Upgrades In This Week's Card Design Competition (https://www.hearthpwn.com/news/5906-ooh-shinies-creating-shiny-new-upgrades-in-this)<br />
<br />
What to do at Level 120<br />
Raids, Warfronts, a new PvP season, and world bosses are still a couple weeks out, but there is plenty to do to get ready while you wait!<br />
<br />
Gearing Up<br />
<br />
You can purchase an item level 320 cloak (https://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/cloaks?filter-ilvl-min=320&amp;filter-ilvl-max=320) from any reputation vendor that you have earned honored status with in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
Normal mode dungeons (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7884-Battle-for-Azeroth-Live-Today!#bfadungeons) at level 120 reward item level 310 gear.<br />
You need an item level of 305 to queue for heroic dungeons. You can bypass this by creating a 5 man group and zoning in manually. Heroic dungeons reward item level 325 gear.<br />
Mythic 0 dungeons are available. Make sure you complete all 10 dungeons weekly. They reward item level 340+ gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
World Quests<br />
<br />
To unlock world quests you must reach Level 120 and complete the quest Uniting Kul Tiras (https://beta.wowdb.com/quests/51918-uniting-kul-tiras) (A) or Uniting Zandalar (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/51916-uniting-zandalar) (H). This means that you must also have completed the War Campaign quests up this point, which involves doing all three war campaign foothold quests in the zones on the opposite continent.<br />
<br />
If you have not reached Friendly with the required factions (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7884-Battle-for-Azeroth-Live-Today!#reputations), continue questing for the reputation.<br />
Your emissaries can reward Azerite Armor and other useful gear up to item level 340.<br />
Increasing your item level also increases your world quest rewards item level. The general rule of thumb is every 10 item levels you have increases the rewards to your item level + 10 to a max of 340 at item level 330.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Reputations<br />
<br />
Champions of Azeroth (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7881-Champions-of-Azeroth-Rewards-Battle-for-Azeroth-Faction-Guide) is the most important reputation. Every rank up in reputation rewards your Heart of Azeroth with 15 item levels. Upon reaching Exalted you can also purchase a piece of item level 355 Azerite Armor. See our Champions of Azeroth Reputation Guide (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7881-Champions-of-Azeroth-Rewards-Battle-for-Azeroth-Faction-Guide) for more information.<br />
<br />
Purchase (or make if you are a Scribe) a Contract: Champions of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/153668-contract-champions-of-azeroth) as soon as possible. This rewards 10 reputation for the Champions of Azeroth when completing any world quest in Battle for Azeroth zones.<br />
<br />
Prioritize 7th Legion (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7873-7th-Legion-Rewards-Battle-for-Azeroth-Faction-Guide)/Honorbound (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7877-The-Honorbound-Rewards-Battle-for-Azeroth-Faction-Guide) reputation as well by completing world quests on the enemy continent. This reputation is needed for a variety of different unlocks.<br />
<br />
You need 7,500 reputation into Honored to unlock one of the final 2 Mythic only dungeons Siege of Boralus (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7865-Siege-of-Boralus-Battle-for-Azeroth-Dungeon-Guide-Boss-Strategies-and-Loot-List) or Kings' Rest (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7861-Kings-Rest-Battle-for-Azeroth-Dungeon-Guide-Boss-Strategies-and-Loot-List), depending on your faction.<br />
You need to reach Revered in order to finish the War Campaign.<br />
You need to reach Exalted to unlock the Dark Iron Dwarves or Mag'har Orc Allied races. (depending on faction)<br />
<br />
All other reputations are also important. They each have a piece of item level 335 gear at Revered (https://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-ilvl-min=335&amp;filter-ilvl-max=335) and a piece of item level 355 gear at Exalted (https://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-ilvl-min=355&amp;filter-ilvl-max=355).<br />
<br />
<br />
Azerite Power Farming<br />
<br />
Don't forget to farm Azerite Power for your Heart of Azeroth. Every rank up increases the item level of the neck piece by 2 and can unlock new Azerite powers in your Azerite Armor slots.<br />
<br />
Make sure to max out your weekly Island Expeditions bar by collecting 40,000 Azerite during Island Expeditions over the week. This rewards 2,500 Azerite power and 1500 7th Legion (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7873-7th-Legion-Rewards-Battle-for-Azeroth-Faction-Guide)/Honorbound (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7877-The-Honorbound-Rewards-Battle-for-Azeroth-Faction-Guide) reputation.<br />
Heroic dungeons are another source of Azerite power farming.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This is correct. The reputation needed is actually 7,500 rep. Gaining this reputation alone does NOT grat you access to the oposite factions respective dungeon. Insted it unlocks the final questline you must complete. With the honorbound or 7th legion, depending on your faction, you must complete all of the questlines associated with them up to and including the final part that unlocks at 7,500 reputation. Only then can you run mythic kings rest (alliance), or siege of Boralus (horde).</div></div><hr />

We can combine most of what you've put in separate categories:<br />
You gear up by doing WQs and dungeons.<br />
You farm AP by doing WQ, dungeons and Island Expeditions (which don't reward as much AP as stated in the tooltip btw).<br />
You gain reputation by doing WQs and quests (most of which you'll do while leveling up).<br />
You do Pathfinder mostly by leveling up, doing WQs and farming rep.<br />
<br />
As you see basically what you really CAN or SHOULD do at 120 at the moment is: <br />
- WQs (rep, gear, AP),<br />
- dungeons (gear, AP) Why are mythic dungeons still weekly locked? So we don't have too much to do I bet,<br />
- professions,<br />
- pvp,<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions are the worst way to farm AP after you get the weekly bonus. It's quicker to do WQ and farm rares btw. So much for &quot;the most efficient way to farm AP&quot;, Ion.<br />
Enough to say after doing all mythic dungeons this week all I'm left with is doing WQs and hc dungeons (even though my chances for upgrades from them are low). <br />
I SURE AM HAPPY ABOUT TIMEGATING CONTENT TO PUNISH ME FOR PLAYING THE GAME MORE THAN YOUR AVERAGE CASUAL GAMER.</div></div><hr />

Which expansion besides legion had more to do? If they had more to do - most players would be punished for playing &quot;only 20hrs&quot; a week. So is this your problem or blizzards that you don't have a job/want to put all of your free time into a game? I myself had days of so I could grind trough the most stuff in week one and then casually play couple hours a day until raids come out. And couple hours a day might not be enough. Shall I blame blizzard for putting too much so I am missing out? Or shall they invest in stuff which wast majority of players won't see at all? Casuals are paying for the game, not 5% of hardcore pvprs/pvers. Deal with that. Enjoy the summer.</div></div><hr />

I thought we're supposed to move forwards, not backwards. You know saying &quot;yeah, this expansion is worse than Legion in terms of starting content&quot; is a bad thing, right?<br />

I don't care if you have better ways of spending times than playing video games. I care that I'm being timegated from the content. 40 hours of content is 40 hours of content even if you spread it across a month. Blizzard isn't fooling anyone. Why do you care if I blow my load over a week?<br />
<br />
&quot;If they had more to do - most players would be punished for playing only &quot;20hrs&quot; a week.&quot;<br />
WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? Who was ever punished in this game for having too much to do? I mean... split raids perhaps, but that's another topic with a completely different problem at its roots. So you (a hypothetical person) didn't make it to 120 in a week and you missed out a week of warfronts or mythic+ runs.<br />
SO.WHAT?<br />
<br />
You know why timegates exist in WoW? Let me tell you.<br />
<br />
There are people who play an hour a day and they would &quot;feel&quot; bad or left behind. But because they're paying customers as well we can't have inequality of outcome in a video game, so let's put a bar that doesn't let anyone through until mr. casual player has enough time to catch up, so when the bar is removed everyone starts to nibble at the new content at the same time - both mr. Iplayalot and mr. Iplaylittle. <br />
You know why that sucks? Because it's not rewarding to anyone, and even better - it's punishing people who have to wait at the bar for weeks to get to play the content promised on the box of the game. Remember vanilla, TBC and wrath? You know, when timegating and LFR wasn't a thing, nobody cared how much/little you play and the game was at the height of popularity? These were the good days.</div></div><hr />

WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN? Who was ever punished in this game for having too much to do? I mean... split raids perhaps, but that's another topic with a completely different problem at its roots. So you (a hypothetical person) didn't make it to 120 in a week and you missed out a week of warfronts or mythic+ runs.<br />
SO.WHAT?<br />
<br />
You know why timegates exist in WoW? Let me tell you.<br />
<br />
There are people who play an hour a day and they would &quot;feel&quot; bad or left behind. But because they're paying customers as well we can't have inequality of outcome in a video game, so let's put a bar that doesn't let anyone through until mr. casual player has enough time to catch up, so when the bar is removed everyone starts to nibble at the new content at the same time - both mr. Iplayalot and mr. Iplaylittle. <br />
You know why that sucks? Because it's not rewarding to anyone, and even better - it's punishing people who have to wait at the bar for weeks to get to play the content promised on the box of the game. Remember vanilla, TBC and wrath? You know, when timegating and LFR wasn't a thing, nobody cared how much/little you play and the game was at the height of popularity? These were the good days.<br />
<br />
in your example mr. Iplaylittle would care a lot and they are likely the bulk of paying customers now, the mmo genre and scene has changed TBC. WoW has adapted to it, vanilla should provide some insight if the old formula would still work or not, personally i don't think it would long term.</div></div><hr />

You know, leveling would have been a lot more satisfying if I didn't have to focus so much on getting 7th Legion Exalted so I can play Dark Iron Dwarves.

<br />
The problem with this thought process is the attitudes of the &quot;elite&quot; in this game as it moves forward in each content release. Right now, the &quot;Need BIG DICK dps/heals/tank&quot; crowd is ruining this game and forcing the time gating. As the crowds in the game thin even further over time, it will only get worse. My point being is, if the time sink players all move to power level say 500, and the casuals are all sitting at 310 - 330 it promotes an exclusionary game play mentality. The bare minimum to be excepted raises, leaving out a vast majority of players. Throw PVP elements into that disparaging difference and it gets worse. The constantly moving bar of item level in this game basically makes IL nearly irrelevant in the end and makes a linear curve like guild wars 2 make much more sense. And they can then stop with the friggen IL squishes constantly. They just need to tune things properly. <br />
<br />
But back to my point, it comes down to the fact this is a sub based game model, not a single player game with DLC. It takes time to develop content, and releasing it as it becomes available with a 6 month &quot;buffer&quot; in case of problems is a wise business model. The only real winners are Blizzard and people that can be happy getting what they are given in the game that is OPTIONAL in life and deal with it without getting their panties in a bunch bitching about it. If a game makes you unhappy, go play something else. If the game makes you happy and you want more, patients is a virtue you will just need to have. Or if it bothers you that much in life to have things the way you want them, go out and make your own game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People's expectations did change a bit, because there's simply more to do for the players that didn't have time to play so much. But timegating has always been part of the game and pretty much every mmo, because it is simply not possible to craft enough content in the pace the players consume it, even the average player. There also a big difference between good and bad time gating, where the bad is the kind where you really notice it's only there for that, no ingame impact except a toggle. So I do think timegating such things as LFR parts are very silly and shows an insecurity with their content on blizzard's part; it's okay to delay LFR a bit but to cut it up is very silly, and if they feel the need to do that they should redesign LFR.</div></div><hr />

Not sure why you read a list of things to focus on as pretending there's more content than there is. Sounds like projecting.<br />
<br />
<br />
As you see basically what you really CAN or SHOULD do at 120 at the moment is: <br />
- WQs (rep, gear, AP),<br />
- dungeons (gear, AP) Why are mythic dungeons still weekly locked? So we don't have too much to do I bet,<br />
- professions,<br />
- pvp,<br />
<br />
Your colorful mythic commentary aside, this is no different than the list you'd have put together for Legion. Scratch that, you took Island Expeditions off because you think they're inefficient because they're not helpful after the 6/7 to get the weekly bonus. So the list is longer than Legion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions are the worst way to farm AP after you get the weekly bonus. It's quicker to do WQ and farm rares btw. So much for &quot;the most efficient way to farm AP&quot;, Ion.<br />
<br />
Interesting caveat you put on this so you could piss on it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Enough to say after doing all mythic dungeons this week all I'm left with is doing WQs and hc dungeons (even though my chances for upgrades from them are low). <br />
I SURE AM HAPPY ABOUT TIMEGATING CONTENT TO PUNISH ME FOR PLAYING THE GAME MORE THAN YOUR AVERAGE CASUAL GAMER.<br />
<br />
No different than Legion. <br />
<br />
Also, in another post I think you comment about playing 40 hours. How much gameplay do you get out of another game? Chances are, you've gotten your money's worth already. <br />
<br />
Also, also, if you know you don't fall into the average player category, wtf are you expecting? Blizzard, or any game developer, has to prioritize building their game to meet the playstyle of the bulk of its players, not the exceptions to the rule. They aren't going to cater to you at the expense of the majority of their playerbase. Expecting otherwise is naive and selfish at best. If you can't accept this concept, this is not the game for you.</div></div><hr />

I don't care if you have better ways of spending times than playing video games. I care that I'm being timegated from the content. 40 hours of content is 40 hours of content even if you spread it across a month. Blizzard isn't fooling anyone. Why do you care if I blow my load over a week?<br />

Those were good old days, yes. Kaelthas unkillable for months because hotfixes did not exist. They waited for actual patches to fix shit.<br />
You are hearing what you want to hear. Stuff should be done for an average player, making small catchups for players who cant play a lot and some challenging content for player who play more: myhtic raiding and high m+. There was never an expansion where you did not run out of new things to do. Not even legion. You would have done everything in week one if that was not gated and then complained how there is nothing to do. While people were talking that there is even too much. <br />
Blizz never support unhealthy gaming.</div></div><hr />

That isn't entirely true, but what they added isn't very compelling in its current form. Warfronts and the foundation of procedural adventures and dungeons in the Island Adventures. Both could potentially be game changers if integrated right, but they currently are very bare and grindy. World quests are kinda lame in the current form. They are just the same quests you do on your adventure through the story. <br />
They should make unique ones for them and add to them as time goes on. I enjoy WQ in games like FF14 and GW2, but WoW's seem grindy and even worse if you play alts... then you REALLY get sick of those quests fast.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">superten</div><div class="date">2018-08-20, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I enjoyed the mythic Dungeons, I think they are all really well made, emphasis on mechanics now more than just damage.<br />
<br />
Now you have to actually interrupt, CC, move around... instead of just grabbing groups of mobs and AOEing them down, maybe its because we are all low ilvl but hopefully it will be even better with M+.<br />
<br />
The WQs are ok, same as legion but this time without the addon to join in groups faster and the addition of more HP to the mobs it has become really boring and grindy, I'd like the option of the addon back, I mean right now what I do is wait for someone to attack a mob and tag it lol, or keep it off but reduce mobs HP, I suppose it will just get better as we get more gear...<br />
<br />
As for the Island Expeditions, I agree they feel boring, you basically run around killing mobs as fast as possible... I mean there is no strategy... just go and find the big guys and kill them fast and move on... with the Azerite being the only reward I don't see myself doing them after getting the weekly bonus, I mean I completed the weekly bonus on my druid and I'm dreading to do them on Shaman, I got fed up after one time... lol<br />
<br />
So far I think the highlights are the quests/story (leveling) and dungeons! Love Waycrest Manor atmosphere!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know I'm a bit cynical, but that's probably intended, the devs want mythic populated, so they drive people towards it with better rewards and playablity. You can usually tell what the devs are pushing people towards, because they know, and have known since vanilla, that players will only go where the purples are. They've decided that mythic grinding is the preferred way to provide long term content, much like the Diablo 3 devs offloaded new content onto paragon levels. <br />
<br />
If you enjoy mythic farming, you're good to go. <br />
<br />
The comments I've been reading lean towards the WQ being weak, because the reward vs effort is broken - most likely they're tuned for levels and gear later on in the expansion - making it harder now is a built in time gate until that new stuff unlocks - and forces you into mythic, since that's where the rewards are.<br />
<br />
Islands seems to be them looking at the code, and saying &quot;you know, we have all this scenario framework sitting here, we only use it for beginning quests in the expansion, what else can we do with it? Oh, yeah, member the stuff we did with it in MoP?&quot; That they don't have epics as rewards says that they're not putting that much emphasis on them. They're there, if you want to force grind AP, so the raiding guilds won't cry about how long it's taking to max out their characters, or something.<br />
<br />
It all sounds very neat and tidy, like a game would be designed, if the creative director was a trained lawyer. Everything in their correct pile, neatly stapled, bound, color coded and indexed. Organized to a T, but...fun? The act of leveling and end game outside of mythic and raiding sounds exactly like slogging through a dense, complicated, technical trial. Step A, then Step B, then Step C, and everything precisely organized on a flow chart. Yet, halfway through, the jury is sleeping in the jury box. They wake up for the end (mythic and raiding) when the summary gets exciting. <br />
<br />
How much better would the game be if they got someone adventurous, like, oh, I don't know...Chris Metzen, as creative director?</div></div><hr />
