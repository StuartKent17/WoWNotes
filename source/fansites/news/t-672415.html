We are trying to make haste a slightly more attractive stat for classes that utilize a lot of damage or healing over time spells, specifically Shadow priests, warlocks (though especially Affliction) and Resto druids. We realize other classes use hots and dots too, but I think we can all agree that it's a bigger problem for the ones I mentioned.<br />
<br />
I'm going to share with you an idea that the class and item designers came up with for 3.3. This is a work in progress so it's possible we'll end up going a different way after we see how it plays. However I also wanted to explain our logic here in case it wasn't obvious.<br />
<br />
We have new tech that will allow specific hots and dots to tick faster -- the time between ticks would decrease. This means more damage or healing per time but also having to refresh those spells more often. Since there is a trade-off, we're not sure the change is a no-brainer, especially in the healing case.<br />
<br />
Because of this, we are planning on introducing the concept through glyphs. Glyphs represent a great test bed for new ideas because they are easier to change (and easier on the players when we do change them) compared to core spell functions or even talents. If we like the way it feels and players like the way it feels and the glyphs prove popular or fun, then this may be the kind of thing that shifts from glyphs over time -- not unlike the way some favorite set bonuses eventually become talents.<br />
<br />
For 3.3 we are talking about introducing three new glyphs for Shadow Word: Pain, Corruption and Rejuvenation that would allow these spells to tick faster with the more haste you have. There are glyphs of Corruption and Rejuv already, and we're not sure how we're going to resolve those yet. For Shadow Word: Pain, we are likely to rename the current glyph to Glyph of Mind Flay, remove the old Glyph of Mind Flay, and increase Mind Flay by 10 yards in the base spell.<br />
<br />
Again, these are not promises (nor ponies). For a variety of reasons, you may see these changes on the PTR or you may not. If you do see any or all of the three glyphs implemented however, we wanted you to have some idea of what we were trying to do. Feedback is certainly appreciated, especially if you get to try them out. <br />

Emblems of Triumphs in 3.3<br />
General reminder: Things can still change.<br />
<br />
The current plan is to make Emblems of Triumph the &quot;base&quot; of emblems so everything that drops Emblems of Conquest would be changed to Triumph and then the new raid content would drop the new highest emblem along with things like the heroic daily and such. <br />
<br />
Icecrown Citadel - Hard Mode &quot;Switch&quot;<br />
Assuming everything goes as planned, you can switch it back and forth as much as you like. Encounter 1 on hard, 2 on normal, 3 on hard, 4 on normal, etc.<br />
<br />
In effect it works out similar to Ulduar but it's with a much more clear method in the UI as opposed to the fairly confusing process of figuring out some encounter mechanics just to activate it. <br />
<br />
Ulduar Change - Thorim disconnect<br />
We've made some changes to the Thorim encounter in Ulduar to reduce the amount of information sent when you initially start the fight. This should reduce the amount of lag and disconnects that some players experience when starting the encounter.<br />
<br />
If you have completed the Thorim encounter after today (10/6) and are still experiencing issues when engaging the mobs in the arena, please post in this thread.<br />
<br />
Please keep this thread on topic, and only post if you are still experiencing disconnects during the Thorim encounter. <br />

Headless Horseman in 2009<br />
I posted this a while back, but he is indeed level 80. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20143782248-headless-horseman-2009-lvl-70-or-80.html))<br />
<br />
Missing brewfest coins<br />
There has been a change to the way holiday tokens and items work. If an item's tooltip says it requires that holiday, that means it will remain as long as the holiday is up and will automatically disappear from your inventory when the holiday ends. That tokens are included in this is intended.<br />
<br />
Remember that your in-game calendar will tell you the precise time when the holidays begin and end in server time, so if you're uncertain if you're going to have enough time to complete things in the future, make sure to check your calendar. <br />
<br />
[...] We have no plans to restore the coins. The coins going away was something that happened last year as well, and it was not a bug then, either.<br />
<br />
If you're looking to get the meta achievement, it does not require you to spend every day doing the dailies, or even half the days of the event. Yes, it will require some dedication, but if you do not have the time to spend to get all the achievements in one year, that's perfectly understandable; the holiday will be there next year, and you can focus on different goals.

Argent Tournament and Faction Changes<br />
At this point there is no estimate on when or if we will be altering the paid faction change service to not reset the Argent Tournament questlines. It does set you back a bit but if you are aiming to farm for all the mounts then you can recover from it pretty quickly.<br />
<br />
If we have plans to remove content from the game we will try and give a heads up as early as possible, but right now there are no plans to remove the Argent Tournament. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/20133932014-argent-tournament--faction-changes.html))</div></div><hr />

You can't be fucking serious guys.. that would be what id generally call: Really Retarded shit!<br />

am i really the only one who dont want to see idiots run around in full tier 9 after a day of heroic farming, the so far highest tier? ;s i mean really now it still takes atleast some kind of effort to get even a single piece of gear.. but with that.. i don't really know... what's it worth to be in full high ilvl BiS gear if i could get the same gear on a whole new 80 dinged char in a week or so..? i mean what's the challenge and achievement in that..? ???<br />

<br />
I read it, and the general QQ is people popping into current gear that's the highest. Key word is: CURRENT.<br />
<br />
If you're going for the &quot;WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT OF RAIDING FOR GEAR I CAN GET NEXT PATCH EASIER&quot;, then stop playing.<br />
<br />
What's the point of raiding at all if next patch it's gonna be replaced? What's the point of raiding if next expansion pack it's gonna be obsolete?<br />
<br />
It's to get people to see the current content. They want more and more people to see the content they design for the players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that's how it always has been. You shouldn't be raiding for the gear anyways.. you're suppose to enjoy it and have fun clearing it when it was new and hard. Don't bother that people would get your outdated gear.. if you're in any type of raiding guild, you will be way ahead of them in terms of gear.</div></div><hr />

There is no point to WoW anymore.<br />
<br />
Any gear you get will be collected by scrubs 4 weeks later.<br />
Any boss you kill will be killed by scrubs 4 weeks later.<br />
<br />
All that matters is Blizzard get their $$$$$, all competitive features of WoW have been finally killed. <br />
<br />
World Firsts? Who cares? Stars/Ensidia etc etc all killed Anub hc 25 weeks ago, NO PROBLEM everyone else has seen/killed it now too.<br />
<br />
Why be hardcore when being a casual scrub lets yuo get everything and see the whole game aswell.<br />
<br />
Zero reason to want to play well in this game anymore, everything gets handed on a silver platter to everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're really hardcore (doing hard modes in ICC) you'll have access to ilevel 277 or higher gear.<br />
<br />
At 50 badges a piece, it would take a week of doing every single heroic every single day to put together a full 5 piece tier 9 set, longer to get the off pieces as well.<br />
<br />
Right now, for the same effort, you can get 4 pieces of tier 8 plus a lot of nice off pieces. <br />
<br />
So what is so special about T9 compared to T8? By the time it's easy to acquire, there will beT10 and heroic T10 that makes it look like a joke.<br />
If you're using ilevel 232 gear, you're not any where close to BiS.<br />

<br />
But I am strongly opposed to this emblem base conversion, simply based on the fact that getting ilvl 232 gear will be FAR too easy. By this I mean you can have 5/5 T9 within a week, and that is DEFINITELY an issue.<br />
<br />
As for the whole &quot;oh well the gear isn't the best anymore&quot;, the point of my post is the gear is still quite high-end when taking a look at WOTLK epics.<br />
<br />
I'm greatly concerned because this makes a large deal of content obsolete (Not Ulduar QQ).<br />
<br />
Now this wouldn't be too much of a problem if it weren't possible to buy ALL OF THE T9 with badges, you can basically gear out too the point of hardmode TOGC 10, through the triumph badge gear (If given the proper amount)<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
I've never said Blizzard is making the game too easy, well...because boss fights have only gotten more complex over the years. Just the triumph as the base badge is just......<br />

No.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, unless they find a way to make it possible to use these new glyphs with out screwing us out of the old glyphs that are needed then I'm not sure I support this as a glyph change. I do like the idea of hots/dots ticking faster though. This would probably make an affliction warlock be nothing but dot spam, life tap and drain life. Shadow priests already have pain refreshed through mind flay so it won't be as bad. Restoration druids should see an over all benefit and a total change in healing style.<br />
<br />
I'm all for the emblem change. I normally take a month off every other month and changes like this help me gear up. I have NO desire to raid because I actually like sleeping and having a life outside of the game. With ICC 5 man heroic and the emblem change it should be possible to be in complete 232/245 gear without ever stepping foot in a raid. The actual raiders will still have better gear but so be it.</div></div><hr />

Let's see... full tier 9 set, 5 items... 3x 75 + 2x 45 emblmems, totaling 315, translating into 80-100 heroic instances. Haha, fuck it, if someone has the patience to farm heroics that much, I say they deserve it. If they were casual it probably took them few weeks anyway.<br />
<br />
&quot;what's it worth to be in full high ilvl BiS gear if i could get the same gear on a whole new 80 dinged char in a week or so..?&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know man, luckily that's impossible. The shit you get from emblem vendors isn't &quot;high ilvl BiS gear&quot;. Get a grip.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Apparently the nubi set is cheaper, 215 emblems total, still a rather tedious task I'd say.</div></div><hr />

You must obviously be one of the people in ilvl 200 and 213 gear, who doesn't want any difficulty in the game.<br />
<br />
Regardless of whether 'said' individual gets the ilvl 232/245 gear, it will still be blatantly obvious they cannot perform intelligently in a raid setting.<br />

<br />
kind of disappointed by wow atm... :-\<br />
<br />
<br />
For starters, the highest tier right now is 25 MAN HEROIC T9. This is 10 man normal T9 that is being bought by emblems alone. The two are VERY VERY different. 232/245 items will be obtainable through heroics. ICC drops all the 232 pieces that aren't purchasable with emblems. <br />
<br />
Emblem of Triumph gear is SO completely not best in slot you can't even make that argument. Also, the problem is that most players don't even want you in a heroic group unless you are geared to raid anymore anyways because they assume the fact that you don't have all raid worthy gear means you suck.<br />
<br />
Feel free to quit WoW. Just don't feel free to bitch about it. This game is about the 95% of the players that don't want to devote their lives to raiding. Don't penalize me because I have a life. I have the right to go after the same gear everyone that plays 40+ hours a week does I just shouldn't get it as quickly.</div></div><hr />

but tell me. why should someone who pays exact the same amount of money shouldnt have the same access to specific parts of the game?<br />

<br />
But I am strongly opposed to this emblem base conversion, simply based on the fact that getting ilvl 232 gear will be FAR too easy. By this I mean you can have 5/5 T9 within a week, and that is DEFINITELY an issue.<br />
<br />
As for the whole &quot;oh well the gear isn't the best anymore&quot;, the point of my post is the gear is still quite high-end when taking a look at WOTLK epics.<br />
<br />
I'm greatly concerned because this makes a large deal of content obsolete (Not Ulduar QQ).<br />
<br />
Now this wouldn't be too much of a problem if it weren't possible to buy ALL OF THE T9 with badges, you can basically gear out too the point of hardmode TOGC 10, through the triumph badge gear (If given the proper amount)<br />
<br />
<br />
Lots of older WOTLK content is already obsolete. Naxx anyone?<br />
232 gear is only 1 teir above what you can already get from Heroics (226), by the time 3.3 hits the live servers, if your a raider and you aren't rocking 245 or better in every slot your just a bad, does it really effect you that people that aren't you can get gear that isn't as good as yours?</div></div><hr />

After reading posts like this I always wonder... what is the driving force for people such as yourself for playing WoW? Do you not have fun raiding and being with the group of people that you're raiding with? That seems like it would be the important thing. Why get bothered by someone you don't even know having something in an imaginary world? Let it go and focus on having fun killing bosses.</div></div><hr />

Any gear you get will be collected by scrubs 4 weeks later.<br />
Any boss you kill will be killed by scrubs 4 weeks later.<br />
<br />
<br />
You do realize the very fact that you use this argument makes you a SCRUB. Hardcore raiders DO NOT raid for gear. They raid for the thrill of things like server first kills. They want to do it because it can be done. If you raid for gear you are simply a scrub to begin with. Since when do they release major patches every 4 weeks? Its more like 16 weeks and you are replacing your gear anyways. If this really bothers you then you should make the statement that THERE IS NO POINT TO PLAYING WOW BECAUSE EVERY 16 WEEKS YOU UPGRADE YOUR GEAR AND EVERY TWO YEARS YOU GET COMPLETELY NEW GEAR ABSOLUTELY FREE. See, there has never been a point to playing this game if you ONLY play for gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All that matters is Blizzard get their $$$$$, all competitive features of WoW have been finally killed. <br />
<br />
<br />
I hear whining on the mmo-champion forums is a competitive feature...you should try that! Oh WAIT!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World Firsts? Who cares? Stars/Ensidia etc etc all killed Anub hc 25 weeks ago, NO PROBLEM everyone else has seen/killed it now too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just so you know, VERY VERY VERY few people ever gave a rats ass about &quot;world firsts&quot;. Fewer care now. NO ONE gives a shit about video game &quot;accomplishments&quot; except the people that did them. I really don't give a damn who the first person in the world to beat Halo 3 was either. Its the same concept. You want to have a successful world first that people actually care about then be the first to cure cancer. Anything you &quot;accomplish&quot; in a video game was simply A WASTE of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why be hardcore when being a casual scrub lets yuo get everything and see the whole game aswell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because you want to be. MMOs are about the way you want to play them. Stop saying scrub as if all players that have lives and take time off from your all important game are automatically bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zero reason to want to play well in this game anymore, everything gets handed on a silver platter to everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then by all means quit. Just don't bitch about wanting to quit and never do it. Blizzard is catering to the people that pay for you to raid. Deal with it!</div></div><hr />

People doing heroics on the order of 15 emblems/day won't have to spend months of failed raids to get competitive gear to even see ICC, but the important part is that the high-end raiding guilds will always see and outfit their raid members first to tackle the hardmodes months before alert casuals like Peter Has A Job can show his stuff on normal mode or low-skill players like Joe Rollface even replaces half of his gear to catch up to the point where he doesn't have to pay attention.<br />

BULL SHIT! Seriously, get over yourself. Just because people don't play like you do and actually have interferences called LIFE (its a great fucking game you should try it sometime) doesn't mean they &quot;can't perform in a raid setting&quot;. I have been out performing in every raid I have been in over the course of the years I have played this game. I just take time off often because I get bored of playing and I enjoy having a real life. Stop thinking just because people don't have the best gear they don't have the skill to get it. Many of them just don't give a damn enough to put in the effort to get it because they learned long ago that gear doesn't matter in this game and is CONSTANTLY replaced so if you are raiding for gear alone you are moronic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
i Raid since Vanilla. I remember in vanilla that our guild disbanded when we had to go back to MC because we lost too much geared ppl and we had to replace them with ungeared ppl... it was a real pain in the ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, you just bring them into heroics, some Trial of Champion, you pugs naxx one time or two, and they start to have decent gear. a lot simplier...<br />
<br />
<br />
Gear =\= Skill, ppl should remind that. <br />
<br />
I love to see a full geared toon telling to everyone that he is the best bla bla bla because &quot;His guild&quot; clear all the stuff. But when you play more with that guy, you realize that he suck. He only raid because he is a RL friends of one of the raid leader etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
Right now, Tops guild are geared in ilvl 258. Emblem of Thriuph are 232/245 lvl. So Even if everyone is in T9, most top raider will still have a lead over casual. but by the time casual player will have enough emblem to buy all the stuff, every top raider will be in Ilvl 277. <br />
<br />
How you can see if a guy is good? don't look at his gear, loot at his acheivement...<br />
<br />
<br />
As a officer in my guild. I'M very happy that gearing ppl for Icecrown glacier will be a lot easier. Recrutement is a continuous process...</div></div><hr />

Dunno why people are complaining about the badge change, as said already EoT-items will be as outdated in 3.3 as EoC items are right now. You will still get the best gear from raiding..<br />

And, YES YOU CAN GET FULL T9 WITH EMBLEMS!!!!! You can also get full 245 T9 with emblems and http://www.wowhead.com/?item=47242 which will be obtainable by the vast majority of pugs once ICC comes out. So, lets be honest, in all actuality this change will make it so that you can have full 245 gear if you don't suck so badly that you can't run 25 man normal TOC (especially after the nerfs it will probably get with 3.3).</div></div><hr />

Noob, you can get the full set of tier 9.0 from Triumph badges, it just take about 210 of Triumph badges.<br />
<br />
T9.0 (232): 210 Triumph badges<br />
T9.3 (245): 315 Triumph badges and 5 Trophies of the Crusade<br />

it's the whole idea of being able to pop into gear that's supposed to be for people who have cleared ulduar 25 and ToCr25 in raids, i don't get the point anymore.. :S<br />
<br />
<br />
I curently am wareing only 1 piece of gear that takes only triumph badges.. the ring.<br />
<br />
There not alot of gear on that vendor thats worthwhile. At least not gear that ONLY takes badges. people will be able to get a couple pieces of 245 and their 232 set with badges. Meanwhile we will all be in ilvl 262 gear</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be shocked (although many might be) if they decide to add Trophy of the Crusade to either the end bosses in all heroics, the end bosses in the ICC heroics or the end bosses of earlier raids. I honestly believe the intent of this change is to fit everyone into 245 very easily when 3.3 comes out.<br />
<br />
Actually, I would love to see them add ToC to certain raid bosses that keep players going back into those dungeons. Many people might be shocked to realize new people actually do buy this game and if you really want to make it impossible for newer players to get geared unless they wait for the next expansion then you don't really understand MMOs at all. MMOs die when newer players are disconnected with more experienced players because there is no influx of new blood and players often do quit.</div></div><hr />

A game is supposed to be fun and not a job. If you see gear grinding as the point of this game you are partly correct.. its a reward for an achievement that you completed a boss that required you to do some stuff.<br />
<br />
If you played in the MC days you remember the 40 people, where there were about 3 epics a boss and you were about 5 of each class. You had to raid every single raid to keep up the gear, and the gear wasnt the fun part back then.. the encounter was.<br />
Alot have changed, and you should allow stuff to change since its an updating game.. hence why you are paying for it. If you want to keep your epics for a longer time its your choice, but when an instance is implemented everything steps up and the average quality of everyone has increased.</div></div><hr />

Assuming everything goes as planned, you can switch it back and forth as much as you like. Encounter 1 on hard, 2 on normal, 3 on hard, 4 on normal, etc.<br />

In effect it works out similar to Ulduar but it's with a much more clear method in the UI as opposed to the fairly confusing process of figuring out some encounter mechanics just to activate it. <br />

<br />
<br />
Actually gear has always mattered in this game, my friend.<br />
In fact. It's the only thing that has ever mattered in regards to moving your character forward.<br />
<br />
Please, get over yourself actually. I'm glad you have a life, I do too. So do most of these same exact people that have the brains enough to have an issue with things such as this.<br />
<br />
Last I checked this game followed the rpg format of leveling/progressing your hero.<br />
Now.. I'm no expert but I THINK gear is how we progress our character at max level.<br />
It doesn't matter if gear is made worthless next expansion, everyone accepts that.. as there's really not a means of extending that gear's lifespan if the maximum level is increased.<br />
<br />
The present time, in the current expansion is what matters. And that period is expected by all to be a rich experience that actually feels like you're moving your hero forward over time.<br />
<br />
Blizzard screwed up before the game was even life with the changes they made to the game world.<br />
But things weren't even this much of a joke upon release.<br />
<br />
It's absolutely laughable at what they've done, and what you morons actually eat up and rabidly defend with your lives. It's great and all that everyone deserves a chance at content. That's fine and dandy.<br />
<br />
But this completely spits in the face of every single person that was lead to believe by BLIZZARD's game design that gear was how you progressed your character at endgame.<br />
If gear means so little, it should be removed entirely and only be a cosmetic change.<br />
But then we have a pathetically shallow MMO environment unless a new form of increasing your character's ability at max level is added.<br />
<br />
And no, don't bring in the gear progression is worthless because of the new expansions.<br />
That's a pathetic argument, as each expansion is an opportunity to progress all over again. And should be treated as separate games really.<br />
<br />
The current game world is so intangible now; it's absolutely appalling.<br />
<br />
They might as well have fresh 80s start out in full gear according to whatever the last tier was.<br />
I mean really.. The progression curve being flattened.<br />
<br />
We're supposed to just look the other way when a group of new level 80 heroes skip defeating Kel'Thuzad. Killing Sartharion and Malygos. Not even know what a Yogg Saronlol is. But just killed Anub'Arak in their first week of raiding, with their Argent Lances and are now standing on the LICH KING'S doorstep?<br />
<br />

In all seriousness, I love reading whine posts like this. It's like....they don't have intelligence to figure out that this gear will be like getting Naxx 10 gear from badges when the current content is TotC. I mean, it doesn't make sense at all. <br />
<br />
<br />
These &quot;scrubs&quot; you speak of are the majority of the playerbase. Blizzard is a company that wants to please its customers and therefore continue subscriptions. If they catered to the whining hardcore minority, what would happen? They'd lose business.<br />
<br />
Ultimately Blizzard is a business at all levels. If you don't like people getting outdated gear that will allow them to at least SEE the content without having to have a 3k+ gear score, then quit. Blizzard wants everyone to experience Icecrown Citadel and fight Arthas. <br />

Ulduar Change - Thorim disconnect<br />
We've made some changes to the Thorim encounter in Ulduar to reduce the amount of information sent when you initially start the fight. This should reduce the amount of lag and disconnects that some players experience when starting the encounter.<br />
<br />
If you have completed the Thorim encounter after today (10/6) and are still experiencing issues when engaging the mobs in the arena, please post in this thread.<br />
<br />
Please keep this thread on topic, and only post if you are still experiencing disconnects during the Thorim encounter. <br />
<br />
October 6th, 2009. Blizzard finally decides to make changes, I guess we should expect changes made to Northrend Beasts by mid July 2010.<br />
<br />
Ugh..... :-\</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Karot</div><div class="date">2009-10-07, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually gear has always mattered in this game, my friend.<br />
In fact. It's the only thing that has ever mattered in regards to moving your character forward.<br />
<br />
Please, get over yourself actually. I'm glad you have a life, I do too. So do most of these same exact people that have the brains enough to have an issue with things such as this.<br />
<br />
Last I checked this game followed the rpg format of leveling/progressing your hero.<br />
Now.. I'm no expert but I THINK gear is how we progress our character at max level.<br />
It doesn't matter if gear is made worthless next expansion, everyone accepts that.. as there's really not a means of extending that gear's lifespan if the maximum level is increased.<br />
<br />
The present time, in the current expansion is what matters. And that period is expected by all to be a rich experience that actually feels like you're moving your hero forward over time.<br />
<br />
Blizzard screwed up before the game was even life with the changes they made to the game world.<br />
But things weren't even this much of a joke upon release.<br />
<br />
It's absolutely laughable at what they've done, and what you morons actually eat up and rabidly defend with your lives. It's great and all that everyone deserves a chance at content. That's fine and dandy.<br />
<br />
But this completely spits in the face of every single person that was lead to believe by BLIZZARD's game design that gear was how you progressed your character at endgame.<br />
If gear means so little, it should be removed entirely and only be a cosmetic change.<br />
But then we have a pathetically shallow MMO environment unless a new form of increasing your character's ability at max level is added.<br />
<br />
And no, don't bring in the gear progression is worthless because of the new expansions.<br />
That's a pathetic argument, as each expansion is an opportunity to progress all over again. And should be treated as separate games really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, gear is a way to progress your character. Emphasis: YOUR character. If you care so much about your gear, then why are you looking at what everyone else has? Those that are behind will be in 232 tier, maybe 245 tier, and a few other pieces of 245. You'll be in flippin' 262 or w/e it is with Icecrown. This same tired argument was presented with the soft-gear reset with 3.2. &quot;OMG everyone's in 226 gear now which I worked so hard to get for my toon.&quot; BIG FREAKING DEAL. The top players and guilds are now in 245~258 gear, while most of the &quot;casuals&quot; are still in some 226, probably lower since they are JUST NOW able to get in Ulduar for 226 and 219 gear. Blizzard doesn't care how much the 5% of their player base values the &quot;rarity&quot; of their gear. Casuals and PUGs still won't be able to get the 258 tier if this change goes through, and they would still have to clear 25 ToC (which is no cake-walk) to get trophies for the 245 tier. The most you can get with JUST triumph emblems is 232 tier, 245 helm, shoulders, ring, and trinket...and then crusader orbs for a chest and bracers. Top level gear within an expansion is worthless when the level cap is raised in the next expansion, of course, but top ilvl gear is worthless when the next raid/content patch comes out as well. When higher ilvl gear is realeased, the previous ilvl gear becomes weaker. This is to be expected in a game that is constantly changing/updating/evolving/whatever. When Ulduar came out, was everyone QQing that their Naxx BiS gear became worthless? Not so much. Was it really that big of a deal that PUGs could start clearing Naxx and getting that same (what used to be) BiS gear? No. Because the top players were jumping into Ulduar, and clearing that and its hard modes when casual players were just trying to get to the point where they could enter Ulduar.<br />
<br />
Stop wishing that it was more like vanilla where it would take you a month or 2 to get one piece of gear. It didn't make you special then, it doesn't make you special now. Gear is a means to down bosses and see more content. I repeat: SEE MORE CONTENT. This is Blizzard's intent: for more of the player base to SEE MORE CONTENT. If your sole focus is to down bosses to get gear and feel special about your e-peen that you have gear that no one else has, then you're playing the wrong game. Don't forget also that there IS gear that only the hardest core of the hardcore can get, such as the hard mode loot in Ulduar, or the heroic gear from ToC 10 and 25. Or the legendary healing mace.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Stop worrying that other people will be getting the same gear that you &quot;worked so hard for&quot;. The top players will be in Icecrown epics anyway. Blizzard is not out to make your epeen feel big and strong by having gear be exclusive. They want as many players as possible that WANT to see the content to have the means to do that.</div></div><hr />

Because the last survey completed showed that 70% of players suffer from depression, bi-polar, low self-esteem, etc. Feeling powerful in a video game helps them escape and they feel so betrayed when others can achieve the same goals as them. <br />

<br />
If you think the only point of raiding is to show off your gear in Dalaran, you are playing it wrongly and deserve all the pain you're feeling now.<br />
<br />
Raiding is an immensely fun experience where you get to test your skills to the limit, hang out with some friends, and generally play a game together. Blizzard has compromised none of those things with these emblem changes. You still get to progress your character by collecting new gear, you still get the sense of challenge and excitement that comes with difficult new content.<br />
<br />
What it has changed is your petty attachment to comparing your gear with others. If you complain about it, then to my mind, that is all you are showing. Personally, I'm excited that I am able to gear up my alts and offspecs more easily, and that my guild no longer has to rerun Naxx and Ulduar just to gear up applicants.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DoTs on the other hand is a different story, you want them to do the most damage possible over a short period of time.<br />
HoTs are already situational, sometimes you want to hot 15 people and other times you only need to put them on 2-5 guys. So making them tick more often means less effective healing over a set amount of time.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

Well, i'm a member of a raiding alliance on my server. We've got, at the moment, 2 25-man ToC groups. 3 10-man ToC groups. Both groups are also doing Ulduar hard modes, to squeeze that last bit of DPS you sometimes need to get past ToGC beasts. (and proto-drakes) Currently, due to RL issues or burnout, nearly every raid needs at least 1 person. <br />
<br />
The pugs on my server apparently don't do Naxx anymore. I'll see maybe one or two 10 mans, and very rarely 25 man. I've yet to see pugs for Ulduar, except on Mondays, and even then it's just Flame Leviathan.<br />
<br />
Do you really want to have to gear up someone through Naxx, Ulduar, and ToC in order to replace someone for Icecrown? I don't. especially when your OT finally gives up fighting his connection and decides to lay off raiding.<br />
<br />
232 T9 isn't that big of a deal. There's already people out there sporting some of it that have never seen the inside of ToC. Good. That lets the raid leader grab someone who is skilled at their class who would ordinarily be passed over because he's still in heroic/Emblem of Heroism gear.</div></div><hr />

I've never said Blizzard is making the game too easy, well...because boss fights have only gotten more complex over the years. Just the triumph as the base badge is just......<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
<br />
You must be playing a different game than the rest of the raiding community than. The fights in Wrath are SIGNIFICANTLY easier to pull off than anything previously put out for us to tackle. The only fight that even got remotely close to anything previously tackled was Yogg +0 and even that was taken down a hell of a lot faster than say Vashj was in TBC. Can't say as i recall seeing to many Pug's clearing SSC, TK , BT or (lol) Sunwell. People PuG 10 and 25 man Ulduar and ToC all the time and clear it with ease. Heck you don't even have to bother with trash on ToC.<br />
<br />
I could care less if they give them triumph badges for doing heroics. There are heroic boss that are harder to down than some of these supposed raid bosses for pete sakes. <br />
<br />
What i find most interesting about this whole thread is that i see people in all this high end gear and they STILL cannot play their class correctly. So who really cares what gear they have access to?</div></div><hr />

Its pathetic.<br />
<br />
When they told us Naxx was going to be easy to be the introduction raid, I never thought they intended to make all fucking raids just as faceroll on normal mode. Its fucking bullshit, it deminishes the accomplishment of actually killing stuff, and it also diminishes the value of any gear you get along the way.<br />

I only do the daily heroic and even then i can be picky, fk those heroics. If u in a good guild that farms ToC 10-25 and comes a long way in the heroics , who needs those daily heroics for badges anyway? At the end of the day only thing u can show off is ur achievements tbh and a proto drake :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because, you know, this hasn't been going on in the game. Since Sunwell.<br />
<br />
Look at it on the bright side, people. UNLIKE the end of BC, where everyone who farmed Kara could get a WEAPON that was top 3 best in slot for most classes (the healer mace comes to mind), all they can get is armor and a trinket. The trinkets aren't even that incredible compared to raid drops.<br />
<br />
So, that being said, you are crying because a person may be in full T9 with an ilvl 200 or 219 weapon? Do you know exactly what that's going to do? Nothing. <br />
<br />
Guys, in the end, it's just a friggin' game. Chill out and enjoy it! If you hate it so much, there's an option called &quot;stop playing because you think it's bad&quot;. If I think a game is bad, I don't play it. How is that a difficult concept to grasp?</div></div><hr />

<br />
am i really the only one who dont want to see idiots run around in full tier 9 after a day of heroic farming, the so far highest tier? ;s i mean really now it still takes atleast some kind of effort to get even a single piece of gear.. but with that.. i don't really know... what's it worth to be in full high ilvl BiS gear if i could get the same gear on a whole new 80 dinged char in a week or so..? i mean what's the challenge and achievement in that..? ???<br />
<br />
Dots, hots idea seems nice tbh but rather stupid aswell, not quite sure if i really like it or not..<br />
<br />
kind of disappointed by wow atm... :-\<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am glad for the changes! This will allow many of us to see more content Blizzard has worked so hard on while still maintaining a quality RL.<br />
<br />
Best of all, we get to watch all the elitists fade into the sunset and for the game to become much for fun and greatly less drama filled. <br />
<br />
Bravo Blizzard!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ItachiZaku</div><div class="date">2009-10-08, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see... full tier 9 set, 5 items... 3x 75 + 2x 45 emblmems, totaling 315, translating into 80-100 heroic instances. Haha, fuck it, if someone has the patience to farm heroics that much, I say they deserve it. If they were casual it probably took them few weeks anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I came back for a month and thought it was an impossible amount to get for my feral bear and resto sets, but here I am with 70 some on emblems working towards my kitty dps set, having completely regeared with triumph and conquest for 2 of my 3 specs. With getting 2 pieces from VoA every week as well... easysauce.<br />
<br />
I'm loving the Dots, Hots, and haste thing since I already stack haste on my spriest and druid, I find it to be the #2 stat to stack after SP, which is why my spriest rolls just about every situation. This was my argument for haste months and months ago - I could get off a FULL rotation on the mage boss in Nexus after merge before the S&amp;M tosser thing. That's how much haste I had and how much burst I could. Factor in mind flay.... jesus christ. Pure awesome.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zhangliang</div><div class="date">2009-10-09, 05:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This article is about a short description of the two famous dungeons Orgrimmar and Ironforge in WOW. <br />
<br />
Orgrimmar The features of Orgrimmar in WOW are magnificent, mysterious, uninhibited and full of wild. The best time of sharing in it is the summer evening. The best artistic conception appears before setting out expeditions.<br />
<br />
In WOW Orgrimmar, the sky is pink, there are floating with metal debris in the air and the sound of knocking weapons. The sound fills with wild. Orgrimmar is noisy. The Goblins carry goods, shuttling back and forth and the Trolls sell a variety of drugs to the passers-by. There are all kinds of races shuttling on the bridges. When the torch is lit, it seemed only to indicate a meaning, departure and killings.<br />
<br />
Orgrimmar is not the destination, but it's bound to be a starting point for Warriors in WOW. Those people who walk in the dark alleys with silent countenance tell you that you must go to search for the battlefield which belongs to you and ignite your inner wild but not recall with nostalgia in this mysterious place.<br />
<br />
The features of Ironforge in WOW are passionate, heroic, indestructible, warm and comfortable. The best time of sharing in it is the cold winter night. The best artistic conception appears when Warriors are gathering.<br />
<br />
When you enter the warm Ironforge from a world of ice and snow in WOW, the fatigue of journey will be swept away. But you will be more profound to think the current situation and worry about the war.<br />
<br />
The Ironforge can also bring people the feeling of home in WOW. But it is different from the returning sense in WOW. It is just a temporary shelter for you in the long journey. Although it is not the real home in your heart, it will still bring you warm and comfortable. There are no gardens, no wife, and no twinkling lights. But there are like-minded comrades who sit together in the long winter night.<br />
<br />
Many players like to buy &lt;a href=http://www.storeingame.com/&gt;WOW Gold&lt;/a&gt; from the www.storeingame.com.</div></div><hr />

Why do they want scrubs to get full t9 in a day? Why do they want scrubs to see ICC when neither of those actually will kill Yogg'Saron? Let them work a little damnit. I hate this. Working hard, yet the scrubs get whatever they want if they wait a month. I will love to see people in blue weapons and green trinkets running with full t9. Whats the point? <br />
<br />
Like my brother, when I tell him to do daily heroics to get emblems, he just answers &quot;CBA&quot;. Now people who don't even deserve it can get full t9 without any effort even. <br />
<br />
Blizzard, STOP MAKING A GAME SUITED FOR KIDS. Anyone wanna roll Aion with me?<br />
<br />
<br />
sorry, but did anyone else not see that group down 10 yogg in ilvl 200 blue gear?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because im about to ding a new alt to 80 I should start the progression at naxx 10 again that no one runs or if they do have some ridiculous gear requirement for no thx.<br />
<br />
Triumph gear is already outdated there is already gear that is 26 ilvls higher and what exactly does this do to affect you. <br />
<br />
Does other people having gear a full i lvl set below hardcores mitigate their leetness. <br />
My suggestion stack and gem leetness pen then stupid baddy yet elitist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point isnt ilevel .. the point is the fact that a guy that played for 1 year almost in wotlk had to go trough naxx, uldu, toc etc.. to have good gear and do hardmodes...<br />
<br />
a guy that starts playing today.. in 2 week might even get better gear than you.. he had not even 10% of the effort you had. your reward by playing this long and try'd to have the best progress etc was 0... since the new guy ll have the gear to do the same u worked for so long in a pug with more retards like him...<br />
<br />
the new guy knowledge about wow, raid experience and class experience ll be shit.<br />
but he ll be there to raid with you and probably roll equally the new gear like you...<br />
but 1 thing is certain.. he ll be a shit, but ll be a shit with gear.<br />
<br />
Also Blizzard tryed to compensate this nonsense by giving drakes if u complete hardmodes before the new raid comes up (examples, Black and plague proto, and soon Rusted and Ironbound).. tough does a drake even beeing 310% speed compensates the hole thing? well imo i guess not... <br />
<br />
I would better like blizzard to reward players who actually cleared Ulduar and Naxx and so one... and got thier gear/tier in there than those who got it 1 month after with emblems from heroics.<br />
<br />
for those who say only &quot;CURRENT&quot; matters, its not... <br />
There are ppl who look for meaning for thier effort and time spent raiding hardcore and thats not a bad thing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Guesswho69</div><div class="date">2009-10-09, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hardcore raiders these days don't know anything about the &quot;old days&quot; of raiding. All you idiots see it as some golden time of raiding. Take off your rose colored glasses. Raiding wasn't fun; it was a self inflicted job. A boring job at that. Bosses weren't bugged to hell, making them a lot more difficult than they should have been. There was no Tankspot, bosskillers, wowwiki strategies so you had to make it up as you go. No videos existed back then. Of course the mods back then were as sophisticated. <br />
<br />
Raiders these days don't know what it was like to be at Chromagg in BWL, your tank or healer burn out, and then the next thing you have to do is drag 39 people back to MC to try to gear up another Tank/Healer. Oh and most people by then had nuked half their FR set so on the fire packs, it becomes a huge wipe fest. Of course those pieces don't drop so you end up there for WEEKS if not MONTHS. <br />
<br />
I remember when you had to spend MONTHS feeding gear to your tanks just so you could progress. An encounter needed 8 tanks, and you only had 6? Back to BWL to go farm out gear to equip those new tanks. By the time you had 8 geared up to go, 1 burns out and the cycle starts again. These are the days when you had no second spec gear, because only 3 epics dropped per boss. <br />
<br />
Screw those days. <br />
<br />
Unless you live at home with your parents, are in college or a stay at home parent, that kind of raiding requirement is stupid. All it does is deter your social life. <br />
<br />
Compared to those days, raiding these days are awesome. I can hop on for 1-2 nights a week, clear out Uldar, TOC. Etc, and be in bed by midnight. <br />
<br />
Personally, I believe that the business model is 100x more successful than the old one. <br />
<br />
Itâs more fun now. These days, even someone like me can have multiple toons, and they can all be decently geared. I love my main, but if I get bored, I can hop onto a decently geared tank/healer and play that role. It makes the overall game a lot more enjoyable, because there are more options of things to do. Hell I'm working on gearing up my third 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stopped reading after this. I couldn't help but think I would choke on ignorance if I read further.<br />
<br />
Ulduar: ilvls 226-232<br />
Tier 9.1: ilvls 232<br />
<br />
Oh noes... dhey have gear to do TotC now. They're going to out gear us in two weeks!<br />
<br />
.....<br />
.....<br />
.....<br />
<br />
Seriously?<br />
<br />
I really hope you're joking. By the time they have enough gear to even attempt ICC you should be pretty filled up on gear from the new raid anyways. Moreover if they need hand downs on gear the problem isn't that they can't get good gear, it's that they can't clear content and need an extra push. Odds are likely that they won't be able to get through ICC content, even with the right gear.<br />
<br />
So again as I said before:<br />
<br />
Get the hell over yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could care less if someone buys the same gear that I raided for, cause I had a blast getting that gear from that raid and will continue with the new content. And I hope they have as much fun raiding in their T9 that they bought. <br />
<br />
I pay Blizzard $15 a month for fun, my job has enough stress in it to fuss over this kind of nonsense.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2009-10-09, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are people going on about that &quot;you can't get BiS gear off vendors&quot;? Sorry to break it to you, but for quite a few specs you most certainly can. All those ranged-slot DPS items are best in slot. No, you can't get better from the 25heroic. The crafted, BoE bracers and chest pieces? Many are best in slot, the mats aren't very hard to get either. Ohh, and you most certainly CAN get a complete set with just tokens.<br />
<br />
Yes, a freshly dinged lvl80 can, in 2 weeks, get gear at ilvl 245 already, as long as you already have a main which can get them a few pieces of gear. You can even gear up a tank like this; have that BoE gear prepared, hit lvl80, equip the lot, gem and enchant. Grab a flask and food buffs and you're ready to tank all of that weeks heroics, and then VoA&gt;Ony&gt;ToC PuGs, first 10-man and then 25-man. <br />
<br />
That's how it is at the moment, I know it is because that's how I geared my DK. No, i'm not about to start grinding hardmodes on 2 characters. I mostly did it because whenever i'm bored enough to run a PuG I can never find a tank. <br />
With these changes, it's going to be even easier. I mean, really, it'll be a joke. <br />
<br />
Coincidentally, for those wondering about the [epic] achievement, that's easy to get if you have a main that can trade over enough wintergrasp honor marks, just buy a PvP item for each bit you're missing and trade it back for a refund, keeping whichever bit gives most stamina or replaces a blue/green item.</div></div><hr />

Any gear you get will be collected by scrubs 4 weeks later.<br />
Any boss you kill will be killed by scrubs 4 weeks later.<br />
<br />
All that matters is Blizzard get their $$$$$, all competitive features of WoW have been finally killed. <br />
<br />
World Firsts? Who cares? Stars/Ensidia etc etc all killed Anub hc 25 weeks ago, NO PROBLEM everyone else has seen/killed it now too.<br />

Why be hardcore when being a casual scrub lets yuo get everything and see the whole game aswell.<br />

it's the whole idea of being able to pop into gear that's supposed to be for people who have cleared ulduar 25 and ToCr25 in raids, i don't get the point anymore.. :S<br />
<br />
<br />
What? Badge vendor gear isn't for people who clear 25toc. There's possibly, but not really, one piece that people may wear of each armor type.</div></div><hr />

Well, I don't know about the lot of you but I'm quitting wow because my fancy wand is outdated by some chump badge vendor. What's the world coming to when people who spend hours running heroics/10mans can get the same gear I sold/deleted months ago?! And why should people actually GET to see the end game fights!? I mean really, if they have to wait til they're 85 to see this expansions content then that's their own fault for not being in a raiding guild!<br />
<br />
But really? You're complaining about craftable gear? Maybe they should just make it how it used to be where just for being a blacksmith you could get better than average weapons. And yeah the epic achievement's a joke, but what else would you expect from an achievement that's almost a year old? Now I can respect that you enjoy posting pages of flame about some completely irrelevant topic, to each his own, but don't expect every man woman or child with at least a 2nd grade education to point out how much of an idiot you are.<br />
<br />
But on the other side...this is the same bull headed conservative 'I can be both wrong AND right' attitude that's needed to steer this country back on the right track. I may use you as a write in candidate in the next election!</div></div><hr />
