Devs know the bug related to Chi Burst doing no damage to enemies when in heal spec? I hope you're hotfixing that soon!<br />
Yes. This issue appears to be applying to most moving area effects. Please know that fixing this is a top priority for us right now. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/847166402481963008))<br />
<br />
shadow fiend is not benefiting from the artifact weapon trait if glyph of the sha is applied. Can you look into this?<br />
We're testing a hotfix for this right now. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/847166800609525760))<br />
<br />
there was a bug yesterday (hotfixed now) where clients weren't getting a GCD on queued spells, effectively forcing *600ms*.<br />
So if anyone played yesterday and thought &quot;This 400ms window feels terrible&quot;, that's a misunderstanding. Give it another try.<br />
It was actually &quot;600ms, plus client not showing GCDs&quot; that felt terrible.<br />
My suggestion:<br />
400ms is a good default<br />
[ping+200]ms if you time/spam presses well.<br />
[ping+100]ms if you're always a perfect god.<br />
Anything less than 100ms is just wasting performance, IMO.<br />
Regardless, if you're not sure, 400ms (default) is fine (post-hotfix) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/847211120582467584)) <br />

Even if that were true, which I doubt, seeing as how many souls I already have now, nerfing it by 1/3rd and nerfing the damage proc is silly. They crippled the talent. It certainly wasn't 5 times better than it needed to be. That's just silly. There is no proportionality with blizzard. They make it 20% at first and can't see how that could possibly be too much, then they end up nerfing it all the way down to 4%, which means not only are souls limited but the damage proc is crap, and then they nerf the damage proc again. It might as well not even do damage.</div></div><hr />

I already have near 100% uptime on reap soul. Go look at the logs, that's why it's being nerfed. The point is how ham fisted they are in &quot;balance&quot;, and how nerfing the damage proc from Rend Souls was the least of the worries. it's just a joke of a talent at 8%.</div></div><hr />

Unerring Arrows bonus is now 4% per point (was 10% per point).<br />

<br />
Not just you, and not just DKs. Is making it hell to play DK, Pally, Monk, Hunter (I think?), etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
Devs know the bug related to Chi Burst doing no damage to enemies when in heal spec? I hope you're hotfixing that soon!<br />
<br />
Yes. This issue appears to be applying to most moving area effects. Please know that fixing this is a top priority for us right now. (WarcraftDevs)<br />
<br />
Top priority with many classes having no AOE damage at all but days go by without a hotfix. No doubt they have TOP MEN (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/indianajones/images/1/1a/Eaton.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20070924225032) working on it :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

HA HA HA HA HA! Also the damn Blizzard Gear site is crashed! I can't pay for my stuff! And Howling Blast isn't doing the splash damage half the time! The only way to fix this is to nerf us more and double Sindragosa's Fury cooldown! AH HA HA HA HA HA! *Starts to sob*</div></div><hr />

this is post nerf, there's literally nothing to complain about.<br />
<br />
Found your trolling on official forums. It isn't an 8% buff. It can't be. The reason is quite simple. SimC estimates i have around 52% uptime on Deadwind but in NH i'm way above that. It's overestimating the souls I get from the trait. It really won't be that good, certainly not so much that a 187k damage proc every 4% of my drain ticks is going to make or break anything. That damage might as well not exist for how terrible it is. I know your kind hate to admit it, but the sims are made by people who don't know everything, and in this case it is wrong.</div></div><hr />
