Path of Cenarius - PTR Test Code = 1111<br />
Path of Illidan isn’t for everybody. What if you roleplay as lawful good? You wouldn’t scorch the ground with demon fire! Your Druid certainly wouldn’t do that to the land! The good guys can notch a win with Path of Cenarius. The consumable and ultra-common loot of the set allows your character to spread warmth, cheer, and growth to the land- certainly something desperately needed in the barren wastelands of Northrend. Stand up to Arthas with flower power! <br />
<br />

<br />
Piñata PTR Test Code = 2222<br />
Here is ultimate party animal in World of Warcraft and the uncommon loot card in the set- the loot piñata. Long-running jokes of Grobbulus and other bosses aside, your character can set up this Ogre Piñata on it’s own little portable tree anywhere and let loose. Use magic or melee- just attack it until it blows up! It explodes and rains candy gumballs, and eating the gumballs will buff your character so that it chews gum and blows bubbles. It’s Halloween every day with Piñata!<br />

El Pollo Grande PTR Test Code = 3333<br />
“Death to Stormwind! Death by chicken!” shouts Niby the Almighty. Expecting a blazing Infernal but summoning El Pollo Grande, the Felwood warlock prepares for his revenge. Unlike Niby, you want to crack El Pollo Grande. You need it. Why? The short: your MMO character will ride a rooster- a giant, Magic Rooster.<br />

Battle-Bot Mountain Dew Mini Pet<br />
Once again we will talk about the Battle-Bot pet from the Mountain Dew promotional event. (US Servers only) <br />
<br />
Battle-Bot - Right Click to summon and dismiss your Battle-Bot<br />
Blue Battle Fuel - Fill up your Battle-Bot with blue fuel.<br />
Red Battle Fuel - Fill up your Battle-Bot with red fuel.<br />
<br />

<br />
As reported in an earlier post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=56281.0), the pet is available to people registering on the Mountain Dew Game Fuel (http://www.mountaindewgamefuel.com/#/home) website. A message was posted on the Mountain Dew Game Fuel Boards (http://www.mountaindewgamefuel.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=43&amp;sid=6dadddbbf41cdcd5cf7a313ae7692694&amp;start=20) to let players know how to get the pet.<br />
The Pet will be free to users who register with the promotion and have a Blizzard account. You won't have to use points for it.<br />
<br />
US Players who are interested in the pet can just register on Mountain Dew Game Fuel (http://www.mountaindewgamefuel.com/#/home) and should eventually get it. Thanks to Jarzak (US-Ysera) for the tip!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Do the redeemer NPCs already exist in the game? In case they exists on EU servers too, by accident, maybe you could just register as a fake US citizen to get a code.<br />
<br />
I don't get why they don't extend this to Europe and other regions as well. Though I never drank it, I know for a fact Mtn Dew is available in Germany, but unlike Pepsi Cola and 7up, not really popular here (not that long ago, I thought it was simply some trendy bottled water)<br />
To allow EU/German residents to participate would greatly increase its popularity here. You don't have to create localized/translated pages, you don't have to do additional promo, just let the users tell each others about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Gurky, well... every year on valentine is an draw contest where 10 people can win a gurky code.. t e n for whole europe! <br />
At least its blizzards fault, they can do it on u.s. server too, can't they?<br />
<br />
Lurky is a completely other thing. There wasn't any BC-CE Keys out there, so in the Collectors Edition was only a code for the normal version.<br />
People who wanted the netherwelp had to send the special tcg card from the CE-Box to Blizzard in France, so when the letter was lost.... it was lost... no netherwelp, no ce, no lurky at all..... This failing for such a big company like Blizzard is just a shame....<br />
<br />
I am sorry but i can't see any EU only pet which can really obtain any person from europe....<br />
<br />
So please stfu with gurky and lurky, you caaaaan't really compare it with this battle-bot</div></div><hr />

When you sign up you choose which &quot;faction&quot; you want to....I dunno just choose to be on? That means what color liquid you get when it fills up...and if it isn't, then they have something else planned. But I'm 99.9% sure it's connected with the pet.</div></div><hr />

They use to but they stopped doing it years ago, can't see why as a lot of people i know loves the stuff. I Have to sometime order some from the US because i love it so much. If they start doing Mountain Dew in the EU very soon then maybe we will see them</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Just try putting in random location info, thats what i did and i live in the us.<br />
<br />

I assumed this was correct, but I could very well be wrong. <br />
<br />
Could also be a popularity issue as well, I know in the States it's almost one of those drinks you always provide at a party *shrug*<br />
<br />
<br />
Or even a third option, assuming Mt. Dew is in control on it, they decided to be lazy and not want to sort through who's Rest of the World and the US (seeing how they don't generally ship prizes overseas) to, I assume, email the code. <br />
<br />
I'm in the US myself, but still find it pretty crappy that it's only available to us. Especially in regards to Canada, shoot, you guys are right next door. You'd think they would have at least opened it up the the NA continent.</div></div><hr />

You receive the code via email so you can still get the pet but you will not receive any of the other prizes as they will be mailed to the address. Just don't enter the drawings so some strange person doesn't receive the prize.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the sense of a &quot;promo&quot; was to increase popularity - and with WoW's international popularity, opening up at least the easy-to-distribute pets to international players, an offering which would increase international popularity of Mtn Dew without any additional costs, just through word of mouth.</div></div><hr />

One Murloc (http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow.pets/aquatic/murlocs/gurky.asp) that only a few contest winners have, plus another Murloc (http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow.pets/aquatic/murlocs/lurky.asp) as a bonus for problems with the BC CE problems.<br />
Then there is the US-only Murloc (http://www.warcraftpets.com/wow.pets/aquatic/murlocs/murky.asp) from BlizzCon '05 (at least more people have that one than Gurky)</div></div><hr />
