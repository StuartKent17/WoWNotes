01/07/10<br />
Rotface’s hit points have been reduced in the 10 person encounter.<br />
Stealthed rogues should no longer trigger traps in Ice Crown Citadel from long range.<br />
The base damage bonus from Hunger for Blood has been reduced from 10% to 5%.<br />
The bonus damage rogues gain from attack power for poisons has been decreased. This applies to Instant Poison, Deadly Poison, and Wound Poison.<br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming 3.3 balance adjustments<br />
As many of you have suspected, we think rogue damage is too high. We will be making hotfixes to lower the maximum damage output of Assassination and Combat rogues. The Combat nerf will be slight. Both specs should still do just fine on damage meters (assuming skill, gear etc.) but shouldn't be beating out other specs to such a large degree.<br />
<br />
Other things on our radar that you might see soon -- none of these are promises and we have no specific changes to announce yet:<br />
<br />
Warlock damage in PvE is a little low.<br />
Protection warriors have too much utility and damage for PvP. (We don't want to hurt their tanking in PvE of course.)<br />
We are considering adjusting (not replacing) the Elemental 4 piece Tier 10 set bonus.<br />
We'll continue to refine and look at the Icecrown weapon procs.<br />
Other stuff (yes, we've heard your concerns), but these are the big things we are focusing on at this time.<br />
<br />
Some of these changes, should we decide to pursue them, can be handled via hotfix and others will be made in an upcoming patch.<br />
<br />
We usually don't make such general announcements before we're ready to share the specifics, so we'll see how this works out. <br />
<br />
<br />
Rotface 10-man Health Reduced by 15%<br />
The changes made to Rotface were an effort to fix a bug that fell through the cracks in development and testing. The previous iteration of Rotface in 10 player difficulty used (and still uses) the same timer as the 25 player difficulty version when dispersing its Mutated Infection ability.<br />
<br />
What this means, plainly, is that a disproportionate number of people were being put out of the fight near the 30% mark in 10 player (by a large percentage) versus 25 player, making the entire fight much more difficult than intended.<br />
<br />
Obviously if you severely outgeared the fight, none of this mattered to you. The HP change will have no effect on your 10 player clears. You will, in fact, still kill Rotface.<br />
<br />
The 25 player version of Rotface remains unchanged. <br />

Need before Greed in low level dungeons<br />
There seems to be some confusion on how the looting system works so I’ll explain it a bit.<br />
<br />
The item you mentioned is item level 56. The new Need Before Greed looting system is the default option when using the Dungeon Finder to make a group on items that are above item level 70, which is basically Outland gear beginning in The Ramparts. Items that are below this number go by the standard Group Loot system.<br />
<br />
We felt this starting point of item level 70 was a better way to go since items can be a little more disorganized at the lower levels and several classes change their armor type along the way. We put in the satchel of helpful goods to balance this out a bit and support players leveling their way up through dungeons. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22418703455-lfr-need-before-greed-issue.html))<br />
<br />
Tank itemization between tiers<br />
Expertise and hit are both capable stats. As the item budget on gear grows it just means you’re going to be dealing with them in larger and larger chunks, which in turn might make it harder to shift around gear, gems or enchants correctly to hit your desired amounts.<br />
<br />
It is definitely a design goal though to make something like Tier 10 have different stats than Tier 9 or otherwise all you’d get out of new gear is a few more stat points and everything would feel really homogenized.

Bryntroll too powerful? (Bryntroll, the Bone Arbiter (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50709/bryntroll-the-bone-arbiter/))<br />
We have found a bug with Bryntroll where it procs too often for Retribution paladins or Unholy DKs. For example both portions of Scourge Strike could cause a proc, which is unintended.<br />
<br />
Bryntroll seems to account for about ~3-4% of dps for a typical Icecrown Fury warrior. That's more of where it should be for other melee. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22048473487-nerf-bryntroll-the-bone-arbiter.html))<br />

Zod's Repeating Longbow Durability Issues (Zod's Repeating Longbow (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50638/zods-repeating-longbow/))<br />
Zod’s works similarly to the talent Wild Quiver. Since Wild Quiver causes extra durability through additional weapon use, Zod’s does too. We will keep an eye on it but don't have any current plans to change anything unless there is a but resulting in additional durability damage.

Rogue damage too high in raid?<br />
I think some of the confusion from yesterday came from two slightly different topics being mushed together in some of these discussions.<br />
<br />
1) Are certain fights unfair to casters?<br />
<br />
Yes, there are definitely fights that benefit X over Y. By design. This is most of what I was trying to explain yesterday. Boss encounters are variable and that's intentional. There are very few Patchwerk-like encounters and that will continue to be the case. We're not going to promise that the first fight in every raid is the mage fight and then the next one is the rogue fight and so on. That gets predictable and boring quickly. If you have an important role on a fight (even if that role is staying alive) which causes you to do less dps, then you should still throw yourself fully into doing your job as good as you can.<br />
<br />
2) Is rogue damage too high?<br />
<br />
Quite possibly, and we might lower it accordingly. That's not the same thing as melee doing well on fights whose mechanics allow melee to do really well. That's not the same as &quot;Icecrown being unfair to casters&quot; because casters can't just stand in one place and nuke on every, or even very many, fights.<br />
<br />
Hopefully that explains things a little better.<br />
<br />
If you see something you feel is out of whack, then feel free to bring it up on the forums. If it's been brought up already, then chances are we already know about it and are considering whether to take any action. If we haven't announced any changes yet, then that might mean we don't think changes are necessary or it might mean we haven't decided what to do yet. Constantly bringing up the same issue over and over isn't really going to sway us more than bringing it up once. It might annoy other players though.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-shaman/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br />
Lack of raiding spots for Elemental shamans?<br />
<br />
I think a lot of players would roll their eyes at a shaman saying their buffs and utility are garbage. Regardless, you shouldn't get brought for your buffs and utility anyway. That whole system is really there for three reasons:<br />
<br />
1) You feel more powerful in a group because of all the synergy.<br />
2) You have motivation to try and have a variety of classes / specs in your group.<br />
3) The various classes and specs feel different, which adds depth and interest to the game.<br />
<br />
It's clear some players out there desperately want<br />
<br />
4) The unique buff that insures everyone desperately wants them in their raid.<br />
<br />
We just don't like that design at all. That was more or less the design in BC and it had a ton of problems. At a high level, there are 30 specs in the game, so you couldn't even fit all of their &quot;you must bring me&quot; buffs in a 25 player raid, let alone a 10 player raid.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of Elemental shaman raiding, even in some of the best guilds of the world (and that is not true of every spec in the game). Those guys must think more highly of Ele than your friends do.<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm pretty tolerant of players who are trying to post in their second or third language. I wish other posters were as well. For posters who speak English as a first language and just don't have good spelling and grammar skills, well, hopefully your point will still get through.

Passive talents in Cataclysm - Threat reduction<br />
Talents that lower threat are probably one of the things we will do away with in Cataclysm. In that environment, we can make sure that Battle stance and Berserker stance alone have suitable threat reduction and leave it at that.<br />
<br />
Of course, the other side is that threat is supposed to be something you worry about. It’s part of the game. If you were supposed to always go all out and not worry about it ever, then we could just remove threat as a whole.

<br />
New shout for warriors?<br />
We still feel that both Battle Shout and Commanding Shout continue to be very useful. If we decided that there was a group buff that needed to be added, we would consider giving it to warriors, but we do have some ideas stirring to make both Battle Shout and Commanding Shout better in Cataclysm.

Yes, yes, yes, combat was also OP. Our combat rogue is doing 10k+ dps, next highest melee is about 8k. Just spec the right way and mash your one of the easiest rotations. But guess some people fail even at that if they dont see how combat is OP as well.<br />

Of course combat is &quot;subpar&quot; compared to mutilate because mutilate is OP as hell. And by hybrids do you mean a ret palys or spriests? Because they're the only hybrids that I can think of that are beating pure dps classes and quite frankly it shouldnt be like that even most of the time. Locks need buffs rogues need nerfs.<br />

The only class that should be close to rogues ( note : BY DESIGN as in equal skill and gear which never happens) should be hunters.They don't bring that much to the raid but they are ranged as opposed to rogues which are mele.<br />
Don't expect the boomkins, lolret palas or other &quot; my class can heal and tank but I need to do same dps as pure dps classes&quot; heroes to understand .The only thing GC needs to understand is that if they remove our dps supremacy then rogues will get benched on hardmodes.</div></div><hr />

They are nerfing Combat Rogue DPS? Have they ever heard of World of Logs? There's virtually PAGES of Mutilate Rogues topping charts, but relatively few Combat by comparison. Furthermore, they are relavtively close to numerous Mages, DKs, and others. This is a pure DPS class, we can't tank, heal, or anything else. They are supposed to be higher, and Combat isn't any significant amount higher than the other classes you see on records. Mutilate nerfs? Fine. Combat already got screwed over with the change to Deathbringer's Will. Now if we want to ArP softcap, you have to use a 226 item. It isn't even possible to hardcap without putting your attack power and other stats in the tank (or using sub-optimal combinations of gear), and all the best gear including tier in ICC has virtually NO hit on it. So not only do Combat Rogues struggle to maintain hit, they can't softcap ArP or Hardcap either. This all being in addition to the ArP nerf a couple patches back. This is getting pretty old. Blizzard seems to have pretty poor understanding of gear itemization or any idea of reality when it comes to class balance.</div></div><hr />

If I could actually switch specs to tank or something else I really wouldn't complain so much. But even before they boosted mutilate , I don't know about anyone else, but it was hard for me to find groups to do raids. There was no reason not to bring other classes that could also bring buffs, or ranged that don't have to get up nice and close and personal. One need only lookat the LFG feature with DPS waiting 20 mins, while tanks and heals get insta invites. Almost every other class in the game has something they can bring to a raid, only thing a rogue can bring is single target DPS, so it's kinda of annoying to see it lowered. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, any classes that are stuck with only DPS specs should be slightly higher than those who don't have other options, not only rogues but it's not always the case. I've seen DKs and Pali's out DPS me in some cases depends on gear, what people use and their skill. Fights where I have to switch from one boss to another, my DPS is gong to drop before I can get my poisons and other skills back into rotation going again as well. Given when most guilds raid and my work schedule I'm stuck pugging most things, and the ONLY reason I've been invited back is cause I can do well on the bosses. I fear them lowering rogues to a point where PUGs or guilds simply will (AGAIN) just bring in other classes instead. Will have to wait and see I guess.</div></div><hr />

Also it's funny to watch 70% of combat rogues damage coming from autoattack only(white and poison proc which procs off autoattack). Afk class topping the meters ftw? Molten core flashback lolol<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You are a damn fool. You honestly have no clue what you're talking about when it comes to rogue mechanics. I'm surprised you were able to make as many posts as you have without getting booted off the stage. <br />
<br />
But regardless, what I don't get is all the epeen flexing that takes place. Honestly, in a guild, we are all after the same boss and end up downing the same boss. TOGETHER. I hope the majority of you morons (people that QQ about dps races in guild) out there understand that QQ'ing enough to the point of pushing Blizz to nerf a class only ends up hurting you. <br />
<br />
Say you have 3 rogues in a raid (like my guild does) and now those rogues are pushing out 10% less dps each(just a random number because no damage reduction value has been specified as of yet) because of the nerfs you cried for. In a hard mode, or even some of the current normal modes, that could be a significant loss and it might result in that boss not being downed. Then what are you going to do? You're gonna go back to QQ'ing about that boss being too hard and you will not have the potential to get the loot you may have in the first place...<br />
<br />
But you know what?!?!?!!!!! You'll be able to look down at the DPS chart while standing next to the repair guy after another wipe and say, &quot;Sweet! I'm beating the rogues on the DPS charts!!!!! Yay for me!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure , lets nerf the only class that brings NOTHING to the table but dps.We are the only pure that stays mele range , meaning all those aoes , novas etc are hurting US , not the ranged pures that are 41 yards away.<br />
The only class that should be close to rogues ( note : BY DESIGN as in equal skill and gear which never happens) should be hunters.They don't bring that much to the raid but they are ranged as opposed to rogues which are mele.<br />
Don't expect the boomkins, lolret palas or other &quot; my class can heal and tank but I need to do same dps as pure dps classes&quot; heroes to understand .The only thing GC needs to understand is that if they remove our dps supremacy then rogues will get benched on hardmodes.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with this 100%. Rogues really bring nothing of value to a raid beyond their DPS. They have little to no utility and the only real ability they have to buff another player is Tricks of the Trade. More often than not, that ability is used on another rogue. <br />
<br />
The only other thing I can think about is a rogues ability to disarm traps in Icecrown Citadel. But even now those traps are being handled just fine without a rogue in the raid.<br />
<br />
My guild right now carries three rogues. I can tell you without a shred of doubt that, come hardmodes and more challenging encounters, at least two of them will be sitting out if their DPS is no better than another classes.<br />
<br />
But hey, at least you guys will be closer to or beating the rogues on your meters, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only by like 5%, and that's when the stars align, both have the same fps, same skill, same gear, etc.<br />
Right now, the gap between mut rogues and the next highest dps is over 20%. The gap between mut rogues and most hybrids are well over 20%.</div></div><hr />

Reg: They've nerfed rogue DPS, the bastards. They've taken everything we had, not just from us, from our fathers and from our fathers' fathers. <br />
Stan: And from our fathers' fathers' fathers. <br />
Reg: Yes. <br />
Stan: And from our fathers' fathers' fathers' fathers. <br />
Reg: All right, Stan. Don't labour the point. And what can rogues ever give a raid in return? <br />
Xerxes: Expose armor.<br />
Reg: Oh yeah, they can give that. Yeah. That's true. <br />
Masked Activist: 4% melee damage increased debuff.<br />
Stan: Oh yes... melee damage increased debuff, Reg, you remember what melee dps used to be like. <br />
Reg: All right, I'll grant you that expose armor and the melee damage increased debuff are two things that the rogues can provide... <br />

Francis: Yes, they certainly know how to remove those traps... (general nodding)... let's face it, they're the only ones who could in a place like that. (more general murmurs of agreement) <br />
Reg: All right... all right... but apart from expose armor and the melee damage increase debuff and spell interrupts and crowd control and melee crit chance increase debuff and cast time slowing and enrage removal and whining and trap detection and removal... what can the Rogues do for us? <br />

<br />
Or, should I say, made another because your last one got banned for nerdraging?<br />
<br />
<br />
I've never had an account banned. And nothing about what I said was &quot;nerdraging&quot;. I was stating facts. People complain a great deal in this game and it's not going to stop. But sometimes that leads to unnecessary actions. I just don't understand the mindset people have about this game. If you are playing PvE, you're most likely playing to kill bosses, get loot, and make yourself better. From the sounds of it though, people are only playing the DPS Meters game and could care less about killing a boss as long as they are beating someone else on the charts. <br />
<br />
If a rogue, or any other class for that matter, is pulling more dps it's to your benefit. You down the boss. You get the loot.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm really afraid rogues aren't going to have a place in raids with the changes that went live. From what I've read/experienced, Hunger for Blood is now a 5% buff(down from 10%) and poisons are going to receive a reduction in how well they scale with attack power.<br />
<br />
Not only is that a significant nerf, but HfB now becomes even more of a bogus and underwhelming 51pt talent. Hell, there could be numbers out soon stating that Assassination rogues shouldn't even bother specing into HfB. That point may well be used better elsewhere now. Especially considering that HfB still requires energy and a bleed debuff to even be used...</div></div><hr />

This post is brilliant...except the fact is lacks any understanding of the bonuses Rogues give.<br />
<br />
Expose armor is something rogues can bring at a DPS loss, while a class like a Paladin can bring Blessings as a static buff that doesn't have to be kept up at a cost to DPS.<br />
<br />
Savage Combat is a justifyable buff.<br />
<br />
Spell interrupts, just like Shamans can do. I fail to see how this justifies preventing them from topping charts as a MELEE PURE DPS class. Spell interrupts hardly equates to a class that can also tank, heal, etc.<br />
<br />
Cast time slowing? Meaning Mind Numbing Poison? What Rogue ever uses that in a raid? Enrage removal? So we are going to stop mid-fight, apply anesthetic poison, then go remove the enrage?<br />
<br />
Give me a break.</div></div><hr />

Spell interrupts, just like Shamans can do. I fail to see how this justifies preventing them from topping charts as a MELEE PURE DPS class. Spell interrupts hardly equates to a class that can also tank, heal, etc.<br />
<br />
Cast time slowing? Meaning Mind Numbing Poison? What Rogue ever uses that in a raid? Enrage removal? So we are going to stop mid-fight, apply anesthetic poison, then go remove the enrage?<br />
<br />
Give me a break.<br />

<br />
Are you aware that your point is fundamentally translated as &quot;We would have utility, but we won't bring it because we need to bring the only thing we have, dps&quot;?<br />
<br />
At least stop pretending that you WANT more utility. Rogues never did. Blizzard showered utility over rogues for 2 years now and the reaction has always been &quot;we don't want utility, we want an excuse to be top dps&quot;. That's what rogues want to do (and it's legitimate, in a way), and they want it so bad that they ignore the fact that they're fundamentally one of the very few classes that have unique utility. There's nothing a DK or a Warrior brings to the table that another class can't replicate, while Rogues have abilities no other class has access to.</div></div><hr />

I lol'd. Brilliant post, if not quite understanding some things (rogues should only use Expose Armor if there isn't a warrior - and when does that happen? - you don't get the melee damage buff and the crit buff at the same time, and when was the last time you saw disarmable traps in a raid/dungeon in an out of combat situation?)<br />
<br />
The only problem with this is that rogues are the only class in the entire game that don't give a direct &quot;buff&quot; to anyone - and if you count tricks of the trade, then compare that to Trueshot Aura. Or, in Survival's case, Replenishment.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just the psychology of &quot;Oh, I don't do anything to help my allies, I just kill our enemies&quot; going on, but it's still there.<br />

<br />
<br />
Apparently you missed the entire point. Numerous classes have utility at no cost to their DPS. They can also perform entirely separate roles in the raid. Also, much of the so-called utility can be replicated by other classes (such as warriors), and much of the so called utility mentioned by the person attempting to be clever isn't a utility because certain poisons aren't even used in a raid situation. That being said, there's still no reason a pure DPS class shouldn't be above hybrid classes, and if you look at WOL reports for US and EU, Mutilate Rogues are the only justifyable nerf targets. Combat Rogues aren't even topping lists any more than Mages, DKs, etc. on Saurfang, which seems to be kind of a benchmark.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Expose armor is something rogues can bring at a DPS loss, while a class like a Paladin can bring Blessings as a static buff that doesn't have to be kept up at a cost to DPS.<br />

I sooo dont want to insult you but the nicest way to describe your ignorace is a plain /facepalm.<br />
<br />
Noone ever said that you bring all those little things to one fight, but you can bring it to any fight, any day if you would want to.<br />
Wich is exactly the problem...you dont want to bring utility, you just want to dominate the dmgmeters,wich made you to unlearn that you have a truckload of gadgets you could use if you would only choose to.This is not bad classdesign this is bad classhandling by individual players and judging by your post you are one of the latter ones. Furthermore i guess you havent had alot of time on Anub25HM as a rogue since Mindnumbling is VERY welcome if you do this fight with one BV tank, to lengthen the shadowstrike casts.<br />
Dont come back and argue that your rotation is so hard and thats why you need to do high dps.<br />
Combat and Mutilate rogues, use the same arguments BM-Hunters used in TBC to workaround the fact that they were spamming one button for a large portion of a fight. Now for rogues and wrath its 2 buttos for great ammount of time wich is really not very challenging to argue high numbers.<br />
So please be less ignorant to even your own class, think about what would justify YOUR spot in a raid and when you cant find anything, its time to work on your gameplay and attitude since even Boomkins have raidspots (and thats clearly not because of their amazing dmg or their redundant buffs).Granted for the owls, they dont get picked alot but they get picked for the various reasons. (and even if its only the RL wich is more than just a reason to be in a raid).<br />
<br />
About the guy posting the stupid comment about the dmg/skill distribution for rogues:<br />
Yes they have really boring rotations but just because Autoattack is high in the charts it doesnt mean they dont use anything else (check MM hunters they will also have their auto attack as highest dmg portion and SV a 2nd highest). Maybe (just a wild guess tho) they have abilities wich increases their white dmg, they need to watch and refresh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't handle... so much win and... so much fail at the same time.<br />
<br />
Anyway, let's just counter this with the usual whining... <br />
<br />
4% melee damage - Combat talent, you know, that perfectly balanced spec that it's gonna be nerfed by the massive crying because assasination rogues are OP atm.<br />
Expose armor - Almost every guild has a warrior to put sunder armor on the boss at a cheaper cost, but yeah, it's some utility we have here.<br />
Spell interrupts - See above, kick's energy cost it's horrible, and if you need interruptions just call the &quot;we-don't-have-raidspots&quot; shamans, they're better at it. Almost every melee spec has an interrupt-like ability (ret paladins and feral druid's combo point interrupt says hi, amirite?), but hey! It's easier to let the rogue interrupt every fucking spell, enhancement shamans must not lose mana!<br />
TotT - Useful for failtanks and to increase another rogue dps. Being serious, it's only useful for some fights to redirect adds or aggro wiped bosses.<br />
Crowd Control- &quot;You know, when I was younger, we were fighting the pulls before Gurtogg an...&quot;, you get the idea.<br />
Cast time slowing, enrage removal, bla bla bla - Useful -again- for very few bosses.<br />
<br />
To sum it up, we have that the only real buffs a rogue brings are:<br />
4% melee damage if they're combat or a 3% improved critical change if they're assassination.<br />
Interruption, like many others have.<br />
Expose armor.<br />
Tricks of the trade.<br />
<br />
The other things are like implying that mages are very useful for the raid because they do imba dps on jaraxxus, it's one fight in a million, let it be. So rogues have similar buffs like other pures, but at the cost of a good chunk of dps, be it poison swapping or combo points wasted.<br />
<br />
Well, now that I've done what everyone has done until know -nerdraging with or against rogues-, I'll give my opinion. Combat damage is fine atm, whereas assassination is overpowered as it is now. The problem is that if assassination rogues do similar damage to combat's, then everyone will go combat again, why? Because assassination doesn't have any useful cooldown (cold blood is a joke of a CD in PvE), so in hardmodes they're pretty much screwed.<br />
<br />
Rogue is a pure class, like locks, mages and hunters, they should do similar dps depending on the fight (rogues should be higher on patchwerk fights because of the melee tax) and nothing else. All of them bring some utility to the raid, subpar to hybrids but that's one of the reasons they're or should be higher on charts.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
A bit of calling the Kettle Black I guess.<br />
<br />
&quot;No one ever said you bring all those things to one fight, but you CAN bring it, any day.&quot;<br />
Yes. Let's give Paladins the option to bring Blessings if they want to, any day, but they must sacrifice in other areas to do so. Before we begin talking about ignorance, let's talk about reading comprehension at 1st grade level. My point was that other classes can bring these raid buffs, not as a sacrificial choice, but as routine with no sacrifice. Hunters can bring replenishment or Trueshot, not as any kind of sacrifice.<br />
<br />
Actually our guild clears Anub25M on hard every week, and our Pally does the interrupts just fine. Baseless assumptions are about as ignorant as you can get.<br />
<br />
So it seems the only one ignorant about Rogues is yourself.</div></div><hr />

You think dps warriors don't lose dps by Sundering? Suppose your tank setup is Feral/DK. Jimmy the Warrior is on sunders and losing dps, because you'll never see Johnny the Rogue volounteering for it.<br />
<br />
I hate to break this on you, but Warriors lose dps on Sundering, Shamans lose dps on interrupting and purging, DKs lose dps on interrupts and chains of ice, casters lose dps on dispelling, spellstealing and often cursing, hunters lose dps on kiting and trapping. EVERYONE loses dps on utility, paladins lose dps on cleansing and raid damage absorbtion, and so on.<br />
<br />
The core reason why rogues don't see themselves as an utility class is that to them the idea of losing dps for anything is unacceptable, while apparently everyone else sees it as a fair trade. I think the TotT rogue pairing strategy is the perfect example; now Blizzard making threat irrelevant in WotLK sure is a good excuse, but let's be serious, when warlocks were threatcapped you still said &quot;screw utility, me and my rogue buddy have to top dps&quot;.<br />
<br />
I hate to be so negative about this, but there's little more unique utility Blizzard can give you; and if they do, you won't use it, because &quot;Rogue Bloodlust costs energy and a gcd, we lose dps on it; let just shamans do it, and buff us more&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point is, a Warrior can also tank. A shammy can also heal. The point isn't that Rogues have NO utility. A class plike Paladins or Hunters can bring a raid buff at NO cost to DPS. I think you missed the primary point. Rogues still are a pure dps class, regardless of things like interrupts that are an obvious cost to anyone's DPS, whatever class they may be. And the point is, as such, there is nothing wrong with a Combat Rogue as they are judging by WOL reports. The only issue is Muti Rogues. So why nerf?</div></div><hr />

Have you ever looked at WOL reports? Or your entire knowledge is based on what you may have seen in your guild. Our DKs and our Ret pally are doing close to 10k also. Combat Rogue just over 10k, and Muti at 11. Muti DOES need a nerf. Combat is just fine.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">carlos5577</div><div class="date">2010-01-08, 08:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You think dps warriors don't lose dps by Sundering? Suppose your tank setup is Feral/DK. Jimmy the Warrior is on sunders and losing dps, because you'll never see Johnny the Rogue volounteering for it.<br />
<br />
I hate to break this on you, but Warriors lose dps on Sundering, Shamans lose dps on interrupting and purging, DKs lose dps on interrupts and chains of ice, casters lose dps on dispelling, spellstealing and often cursing, hunters lose dps on kiting and trapping. EVERYONE loses dps on utility, paladins lose dps on cleansing and raid damage absorbtion, and so on.<br />
<br />
The core reason why rogues don't see themselves as an utility class is that to them the idea of losing dps for anything is unacceptable, while apparently everyone else sees it as a fair trade. I think the TotT rogue pairing strategy is the perfect example; now Blizzard making threat irrelevant in WotLK sure is a good excuse, but let's be serious, when warlocks were threatcapped you still said &quot;screw utility, me and my rogue buddy have to top dps&quot;.<br />
<br />
I hate to be so negative about this, but there's little more unique utility Blizzard can give you; and if they do, you won't use it, because &quot;Rogue Bloodlust costs energy and a gcd, we lose dps on it; let just shamans do it, and buff us more&quot;. <br />
<br />
I have to agree with this guy. almost every utility costs something. Now if your complaining that you dont have buffs thats another story</div></div><hr />

Reg: (very angry, he's not having a good meeting at all) What!? Oh... (scornfully) DPS, yes... shut up! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really really really hope your not serious...<br />
#1. Arms warriors bring an EXACT copy of Savage combat which in some cases is easier to keep up on the boss..<br />
#2. Are you serious about expose armor? Sunder Armor over-rides it.<br />
#3. Dks, Prot warriors, MM hunters, Spriests, warlocks all bring interrupts in many forms AND they tend to be better because for example a warriors shield bash will daze, interrupt AND silence. If a rogue specs for silence with a kick they are SUBSTANTIALLY losing dps and should not be coming to a raid compared to other classes that can buff their interrupts and maintain their dps.<br />
#4. Rogues never bring any form of enrage/cast slowing usually because it lowers dps by such a huge amount and not to mention most mobs that have soft enrages cant have them removed, while a hunter can use tranq shot and remove an enrage like a trample from icehowl easily without loss of raid/personal dps<br />
#5. Rogue crowd control? Please enlighten me about the MANY uses of rogue CC that arent easily breakable in a raid setting with retards aoe'ing their butts off(ret pallys lolstorm) BESIDES faction champs. Sap-need to have target out of combat and be in stealth, KS-on a 20 second CD, Blind/gouge are easily breakable plus on very long cooldowns each...<br />
#6. If a raid is having a rogue disarm traps this early into ICC they are dumb because the exalted rings are basically BiS for everyone so every extra rep is valuable<br />
#7. Tricks is very limited in that we have to control our own threat while the benefiter of it must control theirs(not always easy to do) and they must be in melee range(no ToTT for casters/hunters) and using it on a tank more than once or twice a fight is retarded because of the massive loss of dps you can gain from using it on another rogue or melee..<br />
<br />
Do you want to try to explain to us what else we are bringing to the table besides dps which also is dependent on skill/gear/raid buffs(we scale with every single buff in game INCLUDING focus magic and arcane int[increase our poison crit chance])<br />
<br />
You sir have just been proved wrong... <br />
<br />
EDIT: I realized after posting that a few people also stated some of these facts but I want to reiterate that rogues lose SO much more dps than a warrior that sunders or a shaman that purges or interrupts simply because for example rogues need to monitor energy rates to pool energy to be able to SnD, evis, envenom, etc at the correct time or risk losing hundreds of dps because their envenom buff ran out and they werent able to put up another one soon enough, and &quot;Jimmy the warrior&quot; or w/e loses minimal dps by stacking sunders because he simply has to apply 5 and then apply 1 every 30 seconds</div></div><hr />

Once again, can't be too surprised if they nerf Prot because of Arenas, and i'm pretty sure it will directly effect PvE. Less damage, more threat modifiers, back to 2.0 with you guys. Thanks for playing tank so long warriors, but we're really tired of seeing you guys around for so long. We know you directly asked to not be made PvP viable if it was going to effect PvE, but that's okay, we know you guys like the abuse. Too bad you can't block behind you, cause this ones going right up your...</div></div><hr />

Having buff but choosing to not use it is totally different from BRING NOTHING TO THE TABLE so many rogues QQ about.<br />
<br />
True, some buff are more efficient than others, some buffs have an DPS opportunity loss. Curse of elements is a DPS loss to use compared to one that DK or moonkin brings but that doesn't means that because lock has a inferior version they don't bring anything to the table. At the very least you could use it if the other class is unavailable for that day. This is the choice and flexibility you have, whether or not you or your raid composition choose not to use it is another thing.<br />
<br />
So please stop using this as an excuse to push for more DPS. We have no problem that rogue is topping the table, someone HAVE to be at the top anyhow, but to top with 10% more DPS than the second placed DPS....</div></div><hr />

But the only spec that is doing this is Mutilate Rogues. So why are Combat Rogues getting hit too? That's the entire issue I've been bringing up; the points about Rogues in general were kind of side-notes due to some discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
#3. You clearly have no idea about spriests, and locks.<br />
#4. In our 10-man the rogues use weapon swaping macros to maintain their instant poisons while keeping the +healing debuff up on anub. I see no reason this couldn't translate to 25-man if need be.<br />
#5. in addition to sap you have stuns. And you pointed out a fight where this is useful. perhaps it will be useful again on say deathwhisper hard-mode.<br />
On #6. Its not vaild. Just because the rogue isn't providing the value now, doesn't mean it isn't provided a month from now when everybody is exalted. Could shave 10 minutes off trash clearing. Thats useful time for hard-mode bosses.</div></div><hr />

i always learned that you need to reward good behavoir, look at making a dog not piss in your living room, dont punish him, but reward him when he does it outside.. but it seems that blizz's way of thinking is that if your dog pisses in your living room up to your new leather chair which stands ontop of your new carpet worth 1500 dollar (our dollars!) you need to reward him.. guess i need to try that at home myself..<br />

seen this posted allot of times here aswell, i dont get why people in the same guild, doing a raid instance together as a team, are crying at some classes that they are higher, am i the only one who is in a guild who is not competing against eachother to beat the dps meters?? what a nice guild you have.. always the tence of being the highest..<br />
<br />
you get that if you just beat a boss by a few% now, you just screwed yourself because the rogue in YOUR guild will be doing less dps now, and all just because you were thinking of yourself trying to be(at) that rogue, who might just be better than you, so now he gets nerfed and your are on top of the list, good job, but you all end up being dead..<br />

my reaction to prot warrior nerfs.. ffs get PVP out of the game, or freaking get 2 seperate talent trees that becomes active when they are entering a pvp-ish surrounding.. jesus christ always the nerfs that affect PVE to much <br />

Sigh again...<br />
<br />
the reason that its bad that a class has way over the top dps is that it encourages to bring that class more than any other class to raid</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was surprised by how the rogues seemed to have suddenly consistently (took me 2-3 weeks to confirm that it was happening consistently) come to exactly the right spot on the meters. For a long time my fellow DK and I have been coming top of meters even on single target fights and rofflepwning anything with the slightest bit of AoE. I remember looking at the meter and chatting with the 2 rogues after the fight about it. <br />
<br />
I actually think it's great (from an officer perspective) that rogues are doing the dps they are atm, and I hope that if blizz does nerf them they don't go too far with it as it IS annoying to have your best dpsers nerfed (even if it means you are on top of the epeen meterz)<br />
<br />
BTW, I'm an unholy DK with Byntroll, so I expect to lose a little dps when they fix it. How come, btw, warriors are not getting double procs of it when they cleave or bladestorm or whatever other multi hitting abilities they have? Is Byntroll only OP for DK's and Palas on single target fights?</div></div><hr />

Pure dps classes should always be above &quot;hybrid&quot; classes. End of story.<br />
<br />
<br />
roflmao :) I would say ok, but only if a ret paladin could change his talent spec and gear from retri to holy during a combat :D And fast enough to give a heal :)<br />
<br />
who want to heal plays holy pala, tank prot pala and who want to dps play retri. Why you want to nerft them? Because they are palla? Or because you think they can heal in PVE with retri talents and gear? :)<br />
<br />
mate... :-)<br />
<br />
And if someone has good retri gear - and for helping guild he has healing gear too - so he need gatter many more emblems and gear and he respec for some fights - you want to nerf him because he is helping you others who play it easy style - only pure dmg and one gear? :-)</div></div><hr />

The fact of the matter that I'm not sure you understand my good sir, is that while a rogue can bring marginal utility as well in exchange for a large dps loss, other classes can bring the exact same utility for less of a dps cost (or none at all!) due to their flexibility. Thus the argument that pures such as rogues should be doing more dps than hybrids, etc.<br />
<br />
Say you want an armor debuff on your mob of choice. Rogue sacrifices a finisher and brings the utility. Warrior simply specs prot and sunders as part of his regular rotation with no sacrifice whatsoever. Same utility is brought; however due to the inflexibility of being a pure, the rogue sacrifices efficiency at the only thing that he can do while the flexible warrior simply specs prot and sacrifices nothing.<br />

you fail to realize that every class has to sacrifice something(usually dps) to use their utilities. when mages have to decurse, hunters have to lay down frost traps, or when pallies have to cleanse it cost them dps. the only point you bring is armor debuff but you dont mention of 4% melee increase dmg, stunlocks, ToT, aoe, and poisons for whenever they come in handy</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a lot of players would roll their eyes at a shaman saying their buffs and utility are garbage. Regardless, you shouldn't get brought for your buffs and utility anyway. That whole system is really there for three reasons:<br />
<br />
1) You feel more powerful in a group because of all the synergy.<br />
2) You have motivation to try and have a variety of classes / specs in your group.<br />
3) The various classes and specs feel different, which adds depth and interest to the game.<br />
<br />
It's clear some players out there desperately want<br />
<br />
4) The unique buff that insures everyone desperately wants them in their raid.<br />
<br />
We just don't like that design at all. That was more or less the design in BC and it had a ton of problems. At a high level, there are 30 specs in the game, so you couldn't even fit all of their &quot;you must bring me&quot; buffs in a 25 player raid, let alone a 10 player raid.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of Elemental shaman raiding, even in some of the best guilds of the world (and that is not true of every spec in the game). Those guys must think more highly of Ele than your friends do.<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm pretty tolerant of players who are trying to post in their second or third language. I wish other posters were as well. For posters who speak English as a first language and just don't have good spelling and grammar skills, well, hopefully your point will still get through. (Source)<br />
<br />
That particular part is utter crap, but the raid dps output from elemental shamans are way too low, if it were higher and competeable on a normal level no one would be whining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A really nice post indeed.But well allow me to point some things out.1st:enrage removal=anesthetic poison.No rogues run with this so the only way to use it is have a 3rd weap to swap.Though except TOGC beasts no other encounter requires enrage removal(would like to talk about current raids don't tell me about Gluth).Oh and in this encounter if i remember well a hunter could remove the enrage as well and maybe would take him less time and &quot;cost&quot; to do this.<br />
2nd:expose armor=sunder armor don't make me refer to prot wars<br />
3rd:interrupts:nth to say at least not on this post.Personally,except anub 25 hc adds i cant remember my self being THAT needed to int.(ps:imo,its the best we can offer,referring to all raids from ulduar till ICC.)<br />
4th:traps in icc?Such a major prob lol..perhaps for pugs,not for a guild even if it has to tank the bone guards along with the adds or the 9-10 mobs that spwn from traps in the Plagueworks.(Gluth's sons can be killed at the stairs...)<br />
5th:Tott:u know already that almost ALL rogues use them on each other?<br />
6th:master poisoner:Is a rogue the only 1 that brings the 3% crit debuff in a raid?ah y there are also ret palas and ele shammies for that who in turn bring MUCH more in a raid<br />
7th:savage combat:nth to say arms war are rare in raids and combat rogues are the ones who can bring this<br />
8th:whining?I like u;D<br />
<br />
In conclusion,i'm not trying to be a jackass but well.Rogue=PURE dps class.What is the problem with us topping the meters?I have to admit it has become a bit boring dpsing with those easy as hell rotations but rly nerfing us again?<br />
Nothing else to say except &quot;Rogue for Life&quot;</div></div><hr />

Others QQing that rogues are doing too much damage (even though they are KILLING the same boss) is stupid, since this is a PvE change<br />
<br />

Well its not just a PvE change. I use an envenom spec for pvp, and I completly rip plate wearers and feral druids apart.</div></div><hr />

And by hybrids do you mean a ret palys or spriests? Because they're the only hybrids that I can think of that are beating pure dps classes and quite frankly it shouldnt be like that even most of the time. Locks need buffs rogues need nerfs.<br />
<br />
Its you're* btw :p<br />
<br />
<br />
LoL, unless you're just joking around, you really need to raid more and with other classes (and better rogues too...)<br />
<br />
Ret pallies beating Rogues everywhere? Sure they'll beat baddies every day of the week, but normal ones (not to mention the good ones)? I can see you saying that for UNDEAD trash pulls in ICC when they use &quot;Seal of Cleave&quot;, but considering FoK nerf and the undead status of said mobs, they should be on par or better than others (just the undead status should be enough to get them near the others since the diference should be ~5% between hybrid and pure dps) wich isn't the case.<br />
<br />
On bosses, they're far from rogues (and didn't need the buffs to be that far), movement/target changing fights that you can't always keep SoV stack up but you stay enough time on boss for SoC to not be better than SoV... Decent Rogues &gt; Rets too. Even enh.shammies and frost dks can do better most of the time with good gear and skill.<br />
<br />
So, Rets and SPriests are the best hybrids now... no word on &quot;UnLOLy&quot; DPS DKs and Feral druid DPS? For real? Or they're now considered Pure DPS classes?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, yes, yes, combat was also OP. Our combat rogue is doing 10k+ dps, next highest melee is about 8k. Just spec the right way and mash your one of the easiest rotations. But guess some people fail even at that if they dont see how combat is OP as well.<br />

Also it's funny to watch 70% of combat rogues damage coming from autoattack only(white and poison proc which procs off autoattack). Afk class topping the meters ftw? Molten core flashback lolol<br />

Well not saying they need to at more time to the cd but more like just don't let them use that kinda skill in arena.

I have to fight with the locks in my guild. If rogues gets the nerf, we will be below even the stupid mages now?! Now the locks in my guild will taker over my spot :( Oh god...<br />
<br />
At least is only combat.. So its only in PvE we get the nerf<br />
<br />
Just read mutilate would be nerfed too... Fuck you blizzard now we wont be able to kill again. <br />
<br />
<br />
From my personal raiding experience, mages are currently destroying warlocks in PvE. So your comment seems a little backwards to me in that regard.<br />
<br />
The top 3 classes DPS-wise in our raids seem to be: rogues, unholy dks, and hunters.<br />
<br />
All I care about is downing the bosses, though. Damage meters be damned.</div></div><hr />

We have no pets, no raid buffs. We can’t heal, we can’t tank for more than 15 seconds when the great unpleasantness happens (the tank dies). Yep, rogues got beat down hard, pummeled, one-shot by the nerf stick today. To all those QQing classes that dreamed of this, enjoy your death when you’re top aggro, the tank dies, and the rogue isn’t there to save your asses for 15 seconds while a druid revives your tank.<br />
<br />
I’ve never QQ’d about any other class doing well. I cheered our mage the first time he doubled my DPS on Jaraxxus, and I see all the other classes do well and beat me from time to time and think, wow we’re gonna be able to clear this raid. In fact, warriors, DKs and pallies are gonna beat a rogue every time on a non-single-target event, but that’s awesome for the raid.<br />
<br />
If you look at my gear score on wow-heroes or some other ranking system, you’ll see I’m pretty pimped out, (5770 if you have the GearScore mod; Nightsend on US-Windrunner) yet I get beat by ret pallies, fury warriors, and some other classes from time to time. More to the point, on a pure beat down tank and spank like the Twins, I got beat by 5 other players last night. Some of this is RNG issues because RNG can make a difference when you kill them so fast, and the number of orbs that happen to hit you varies, but clearly these classes aren’t so lame.<br />
<br />
Rogues have one main role in a raid IMO… Bring the smack down to single target bosses. When all you QQers get to phase 3 on Professor Putricide, and you see what a DPS check that really is, I’m sure you’ll be QQing that your rogue(s) couldn’t do more. Take that, and stick it… Then again, the QQers of the world will likely never see that in a 25-man raid (until it's nerfed), because good raiders don’t whine so much – they look at the raid as a whole and utilize every advantage to win. For all you casual whiners… just shut up and wait for the boss nerf so you can be happy and feel like you killed it.</div></div><hr />

In a raid setting if your tank dies it is pretty much a wipe. Even if you revive a tank he'll have a hell of time getting back to the top of the aggro charts.<br />

The last time I've seen a rogue successfully evade tank to prevent a wipe was 5-man Shadow Labs back in TBC.</div></div><hr />

Last night on Prof-25 we had a tank die, our other rogue managed to stay alive with evasion, and a druid who was good enough to realize what happened had him up in less than 5 secs. Did all the pallies and priest know to buff him? Yes. When he taunted did he go just above the current top threat person on the chart? Yes. Did the rogues and hunters know to tricks and MD him? Yes, and we then continued to take him from 70% to 40% before he just wore us out on that attempt. It does happen, even if it shouldn't.</div></div><hr />

I've mostly avoided this thread as being just massive QQ from both sides (no this is not the end of the world for rogues, but no, rogues don't bring much the fight except DPS. Yes we have a few utility abilities, yes using them is usually a *huge* DPS loss). This statement is just plain silly Though. I've evade tanked lots of things when the tank went down. I held Jarraxus for a good 15-20 seconds once till one of the offtanks could get in to pick him up. Interrupting Fel Fireball went from a &quot;nice thing&quot; to &quot;F-ing critical&quot;, but otherwise it worked out fine. Druid ressed the MT and he took over as OT. I tanked the last 100K or so of Tyrannus when the tank went down. I even tanked a good chunk of P3 Black Knight, back when doing so was still reasonably challenging. I'll never claim that rogues are good tanks, far from it, but with evasion popped, and good timing on CoS we can often finish a short fight or hold a longer boss for a res or OT.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">loftus</div><div class="date">2010-01-08, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">its funny to see all the non-rogues complaining because they arent top off the charts, right next to the rogues complaining because they have to be top of the charts.<br />
<br />
The point all non-rogues are missing is that rogues have no choice in playing.<br />
<br />
they can either spec:<br />
<br />
melee single target dps or melee single target dps or hiding.<br />
<br />
rogues bring no buffs that can be done out of combat or without ruining rotations. <br />
<br />
rogues cannot spec to tank or heal. <br />
<br />
to sum up, rogues cant:<br />
<br />
tank<br />
heal<br />
buff<br />
aoe<br />
ranged dps<br />
<br />
when you are left with one single role for your entire class, you have to do it damn well. the reason alot of rogues are complaining is because if you see a rogue at number 5 or 6 on the dps charts, (as a raid leader) why would you bring them again? <br />
<br />
As a side note, if blizz felt they have to do something i would much rather the other 9 classes get buffed. i cant stand having stuff taken away from the classes. warlocks getting a buff is great, but i hate to hear about nerfs, as all it does is lower the raid's damage output.</div></div><hr />

The change to envenom caused AP to be the top EP stat, and haste suddenly became a big factor. This was due to the extra proc once deadly poison is 5-stacked from the main hand weapon, and how AP factors into that. It was a huge difference, so rogues spent small fortunes to re-gem for AP (attack power) and haste (to get more out of these procs). Now, poisons are being nerfed and I'm highly suspicious that I'll be going back to Agility and maybe Crit gems. With 24 sockets, this is getting ridiculously expensive. It takes a huge amount of time to afford these changes every couple weeks.<br />

These bits made me laugh just a little bit harder.<br />
<br />
People need to get out of the &quot;All I can do is DPS so I should obviously do it better than anyone else&quot; mentality. Any spec is so defined to a specific role that they're unable to do another with any significant success where current PvE is measured; Raiding content. Asking a healing class to heal without the proper spec/setup is like asking a Rogue to DPS while specced into deep Subtlety, it just doesn't happen with any sort of real measure.<br />
Also you knew that the only role Rogues could fulfil was damage when you rolled it. You &quot;paid the price&quot; for not having that freedom to change your role by being exceptionally good at the only role you can do. Hybrids &quot;paid the price&quot; of that exceptional performance for the freedom to change their role. If you don't like it, then change your class but I can tell you now, the grass isn't any greener over here.<br />
<br />
All classes bring specific mechanics or buffs needed for a fully functional raid, not just healing, damage or mitigation. Interrupts, snares, stuns, CCs, MS effects, MD effects, dispells (of all varieties) plus some shit I can't remember are all required for a raid to work. Saying rogues bring nothing to raids beyond damage stopped being true when you learned to press Kick, apply Crippling/Wounding/Mind numbing poisons, use TotT, Sap and use stuns on targets susceptible to them.<br />
<br />
There are times when I'm thankful to have that Blood DK, that Shadow priest or that Rogue in my group. Not specifically because they bring certain buffs but because the person behind the keyboard knows what the fuck they're doing and uses all the current tools availible to them to help the raid succeed. <br />
<br />
A little anecdotal, my guilds rogues are doing 12.7kDPS on Saurfang as Muti and 11.2kDPS as Combat. Given the suggested 10% damage nerf, that still leaves them at 11.4kDPS and 10kDPS (I'm aware Combat doesn't get hit as hard). In 25ToC gear. I'd say you're still in a comparatively healthy (Read; On top) position when it comes to the DPS ladder. If your position slips, then you're either playing with some awesome players, which is good, or you're not as good as you think you are, which is your own personal problem to fix not the classes as a whole.<br />
<br />
My rogues also concur with the nerfs. Not specifically, just that some sort of nerf was needed, and have been saying so since they saw the buffs they were getting in the PTR patch notes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's the problem with these types of comments: The COST of the useful rogue abilities is disproportionately higher for EVERY ONE of them that gets mentioned EXCEPT for TotT, Kick, and Savage Combat. TotT mainly gets traded between rogues, and while useful for some fights, will almost never be game changing, due to the current status of tank TPS. Kick is also not that big a utility right now (thank god, Vezax fights make me want to claw my eyes out), and while it might be bigger on Heroic modes, it still is part of a small minority of fights. Of these three, the only one that can't be provided just as easily by another class is Savage Combat.<br />
<br />
The other utility that rogues bring suffer from two problems: The first is that they have a much higher cost in terms of DPS than other classes utilities that do the same thing. The problem is not that some cost exists, as many people in this thread have argued, its the fact that the cost is so much higher than for other classes, meaning that rogues pay far more in terms of raw dps for their abilities than other classes, which makes them far less desirable to have in a raid when you use them for utility instead of dps. This leads to the second problem: The utility that rogues pay a disproportionately high cost for is probably already in your raid somewhere in a much more desirable form. The only slight exception to this is wound poison. Due to the current state of rogues, while we do lose a good chunk of dps going wound, its scaling and damage makes it at least slightly attractive. However... in a fight where you're racing a tight dps timer, it is almost 100% certain that you'll want another class to provide the MS, and the rogue doing max dps. Either way, rogue utility in almost every case is not something that you invite them to the raid for, its a last ditch ability that can be used if someone dies until they are resed, or if you have absolutely no other option.<br />
<br />
So does rogue utility exist? Yes, for sure. Is it something you want to build a raid around, or depend on for the utility that you need? Almost certainly not.</div></div><hr />

Aha, Touche! There are only two problem with your clever little comment. The first is that I never said that rogue don't bring something no one else does. My two sentence comment on the matter was carefully worded with &quot;usually&quot;s and &quot;mostly&quot;s. The second is that in order to perform this handy poor man's Off-Tank role we have to be top DPS. it only works when the tank dies and the next person he turns to is the rogue. We have no real aggro generation abilities (quite the contrary) hence no way to become a temporary OT without being at or near second on the threat meter.</div></div><hr />

If anything, the other weapon procs need to be closer to this level.<br />

Also note that Shadow's Edge isn't necessarily designed to be the ultimate weapon available, given that acquiring one might not require anything more than having a large bank account to swing around.

..so you buff classes who actually need it, to compensate?

When it comes to rogues - one can hardly find 'em whining as much about other classes as opposed to other classes complaining about rogues. Or maybe i am totally blind by the &quot;fact&quot; how OP rogues are? haha <br />
<br />
Class envy is bad, right? ;D<br />
<br />
As far as utility goes - rogue utility is in the form of DPS pretty much. Take basic example: Gluth fight in Naxx. Do you want a rogue cut his DPS by like 1/4 by using Anesthetic to remove Gluth's enrage? Or maybe even by 1/2 to add some Crippling poison , so the guy goes FOK some zombies (dropping whatever is left of his rotation), because a hunter refuses to do trap/tranq. shot? I saw it happen. <br />
<br />
The DPS a rogue provides is worth a lot more than utility a rogue can provide in any other form being it expose or crippling poisons, etc. Certain fights do require all utility you can squeeze out of the raid. The point is that on your avg fight - rogue's DPS &gt;&gt;&gt; rogue's utility provided us by devs. If someone cannot grasp this - they probably hardly ever played rogue to much extent.<br />
<br />
Said that, I do not personally care all that much about rogue nerf itself. Rogue DPS isn't going to be lower that your avg. Also as many noted - too high dps = too many rogues present in the raid, and other classes can be neglected, which is bad obviously. <br />
<br />
Another point is i find it hilarious how combat rogues whine about combat being nerfed along with mutilate. Combat pretty much dominated over mutilate before 3.3, especially when FOK interrupt was active and allowed Yogg Hardmode to be done much easier. Now that Mutilate got some &quot;love&quot; (granted too much of love, eh) it didn't quite last too long.</div></div><hr />

This leads to the second problem: The utility that rogues pay a disproportionately high cost for is probably already in your raid somewhere in a much more desirable form. The only slight exception to this is wound poison. Due to the current state of rogues, while we do lose a good chunk of dps going wound, its scaling and damage makes it at least slightly attractive. However... in a fight where you're racing a tight dps timer, it is almost 100% certain that you'll want another class to provide the MS, and the rogue doing max dps. Either way, rogue utility in almost every case is not something that you invite them to the raid for, its a last ditch ability that can be used if someone dies until they are resed, or if you have absolutely no other option.<br />
<br />
So does rogue utility exist? Yes, for sure. Is it something you want to build a raid around, or depend on for the utility that you need? Almost certainly not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Re: Disproportionate oppurtunities costs for utility use.<br />
<br />
All utility costs raw output, whether it be tank threat, DPS or healing (there are exceptions). To say that rogues suffer the most is erroneous. I'm not going to argue that DKs and warriors have a tougher time interrupting, or that CoT is always going to be better than Mind numbing because it's all circumstantial and anecdotal.<br />
<br />
All specs lose number output when they use utility. I could definitely list every single utility spell and describe exactly how the respective spec suffers from using it, I simply don't have the time.<br />
The fact is that rogues have the option of not losing anything and putting out full numbers where the other classes simply can't compete whether they're using utility or not. When they (non-rogues) are, there's an even bigger discrepency in comparative numbers, hence the &quot;let someone else do it, the rogues do more DPS&quot; mentality. Yes they lose &quot;more&quot;, because their &quot;more&quot; pool is bigger to begin with. A 10k DPS rogue losing 20% DPS is more than an 8k Balance druid losing 20%.<br />
<br />
Also you never build a raid around a single class. You get a foundation then go &quot;Ok we need X so we should get Class Y or Z&quot;, and if you can't depend on your rogues then get new rogues.<br />
<br />

The assasin build itself is all about max dmg as I see it, while combat is well balanced in dynamic fights. Maybe sub is the utility spec that will shine next expansion. Combat VS mutilate? I asume combat rogues scales alot better than mutilate when it comes to gear. So when both got BiS gear combat should be equal on single and dominant on multitarget fights.<br />
<br />
Havent bothered readin 10 pages of ppl complaining so maybe my suggestion have already been mentioned. Blizzard already nerfed HfB from 15 % to 10 %, and now they make it 5 %. This makes me very sad that blizzard can nerf/buff us so easly just by one ability, I want them to rather redesign some of the other we got. Examples: <br />
<br />
Why didnt Glyph of HfB simply got redesigned? Making it into less usefull or even utter useless like HfB dont recuire any bleeds or the duration lasts 1 min ekstra. Or each time you use it you heal yourself for % amount ( asume low like 2-3% of total HP. It is Hunger for blood after all ) For those who dont know, this glyph currently gives us 3 % + HfB<br />
<br />
While I am at it, Cold blood feels very boring in PvE. Increase the CD to 5-8min or something. and add a feature that will restore your energy back to 100 %. This will be easier for us to compete against combat rogues when it comes to nukefights. How this effect on PVP? I dont care. Rogues will always be OP no matter what. Only one nerf can kill us in PvP. Take away our stealth ability</div></div><hr />

Most ppl who roll rogues do so for World PvP/Arena, and not for PvE reasons.<br />
Blizz intended for combat to be the PvE spec, and as such, it doesn't really need a nerf. <br />
Mutilate is supposed to be a PvP spec, and as such, is doing too much dmg in PvE compared to Combat.<br />
<br />
TL,DR: Ok, nerf Mut, but leave Combat alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, yes, yes, combat was also OP. Our combat rogue is doing 10k+ dps, next highest melee is about 8k. Just spec the right way and mash your one of the easiest rotations. But guess some people fail even at that if they dont see how combat is OP as well.<br />
<br />
Also it's funny to watch 70% of combat rogues damage coming from autoattack only(white and poison proc which procs off autoattack). Afk class topping the meters ftw? Molten core flashback lolol<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
YOU sir are the prime f@%# QQ example. What you need to realize is the rogues dont bring anything else to the table except DMG. Not even one damn buff. I usually never voice my opinion when we get nerfed but its getting back to the post ICC days. And Blizz always gives in.<br />
Strictly damage. We should be on top. ALWAYS . <br />
And it doesnt matter what the fight is.<br />
So saying rogue A does 10k and toon B only 8k is ONE lame reason. Good Job Blizzard</div></div><hr />

Yes. Let's give Paladins the option to bring Blessings if they want to, any day, but they must sacrifice in other areas to do so. Before we begin talking about ignorance, let's talk about reading comprehension at 1st grade level. My point was that other classes can bring these raid buffs, not as a sacrificial choice, but as routine with no sacrifice. Hunters can bring replenishment or Trueshot, not as any kind of sacrifice.<br />
<br />
Actually, in both of those cases they may be sacrificing personal dps for the raid. If an enhance shaman, blood DK, or even another hunter in the raid already offers the buff then there is little reason for an MM hunter to take TSA. They can instead put it into something that would likely be more of a personal benefit (Imp. Steady Shot, Focused Aim, etc..). SV hunters get a very mild agility buff from taking Replenishment but again depending on gear there are other far better choices (i.e. Improved Serpent Sting with 2 piece T9).<br />
<br />
Both of your examples potentially sacrifice personal dps for utility...but don't let reality interfere with your ignorance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For this very post: 5 classes bring replen buff to the table. However, usually only spriests and ret pallies truly provide that buff for the raid, since it conveniently tied to a major dps talent. Any surv hunter and des lock will happily drop reple talent out of his spec, yet they are forced to not do so, esp. in 10-man guild because replenishment is one of the few mandatory buffs . And frost mages have been excluded from raids since 3.0. <br />
<br />
In this case, they are very similar to rogue in that they must sacrify a portion of their DPS to provide utility to the raid. Its just so well hidden that many people aint aware of it.</div></div><hr />

You &quot;paid the price&quot; for not having that freedom to change your role by being exceptionally good at the only role you can do. Hybrids &quot;paid the price&quot; of that exceptional performance for the freedom to change their role. If you don't like it, then change your class but I can tell you now, the grass isn't any greener over here.<br />
<br />
All classes bring specific mechanics or buffs needed for a fully functional raid, not just healing, damage or mitigation. Interrupts, snares, stuns, CCs, MS effects, MD effects, dispells (of all varieties) plus some shit I can't remember are all required for a raid to work. Saying rogues bring nothing to raids beyond damage stopped being true when you learned to press Kick, apply Crippling/Wounding/Mind numbing poisons, use TotT, Sap and use stuns on targets susceptible to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In fairness i had no idea what a rogue would do when i rolled it. rogue was what i started with and the only class i ever got to raiding standard. My class choice was out of warrior and rogue, and i picked rogue because a friend who was already playing said that warriors couldnt do much damage (this was a while a go, when a much higher percentage of warriors were tanks/forced to tank lol) so i picked rogue. i didnt know what dps was, i didnt understand what buffs were, i just ended up with the class and continued playing it.<br />
<br />
I do see your point thought, although the majority of utility mentioned can be done by others too. Im trying to say that rogues offer very little that is unique in a raid. Their dps is by far the biggest asset. <br />
<br />
I understand why things are nerfed, i just wish they werent originally overbuffed. i would rather very slight buffs until it feels right than the usual massive buff, 2 weeks, then massive nerf. <br />
<br />
It would be cool to have 10 level 80s though. That way i could just keep playing whatever has been buffed most recently, so i would switch to warlock when the changes happen for example, to see how much effect it has on my play :)</div></div><hr />

However, the other 'pure dps' classes are ranged, and not up there in your face with the boss trying to stay next to them, dealing with cleaves, aoes or other fun mechanics, while ranged classes don't need to always worry about moving. (Of course this depends on the fight, but again, so does 'high rogue dps', always depends on the fight doesn't it?).<br />
<br />
Also, it's typically the ret palis, unholy dks and ok, well. hunters and mages that have been beating me lately in raids. I'm not all geared out and with a raiding guild at the moment though, so it's hard for me to compare, but in no way am I 3k above everyone else with supposed similar gear. I still think it was a lil too soon to jump to the nerf bat before everyone kind of got their tier 10 gear and ICC wings opened and all that fun stuff. Time will tell I guess. <br />

Change HfB to &quot;Allows your bleed and DoT poisons to crit based on your mele critical strike chance.&quot; <br />

That way rupture can (possibly) come back into the rotation. Also change cold blooded from 100% crit chance on next attack to &quot;Increases crit chance by 15% but decreases movement speed by 25% over 10 seconds.&quot; cause right now it's a worthless CD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm going to call y'all rogues out.<br />
<br />
1. You DO bring buffs. ToT, 3% crit (mut), 4% phys damage (combat). These are just a few. The rest apparently do shit to your DPS (as if other classes don't.). No, I don't care if other classes make them obsolete. It's still utility, but you claim you don't have any. An enh shaman makes most of blood and frost DK utilities obsolete, but they still have it available.<br />
<br />
2. You pure classes are only supposed to have a 5% advantage to the rest of us &quot;hybrids&quot;. Last time I checked, in order to have a ~1k DPS advantage from second place, you would have to be doing 20k to 19k DPS, respectively. Needless to say, we're not at that level yet. Rogues also constantly beat other pure classes in DPS charts. &quot;Yeah, but other pure classes have buffs!&quot; So do you, read point 1.<br />
<br />
3. There are also rogues claiming that you shouldn't focus on beating other DPS, but rather down the boss. Easy for you to say, you're up at the very top in charts, with minimum/zero difficulty. If you don't care about charts, then you shouldn't be afraid of losing some personal DPS for buffs. Also, if you are saying that, why are you QQing about your DPS loss? They're apparently going to buff locks, and possibly others so raid DPS is going to stay relatively unmolested. No matter what you think about yourself or your raid, there WILL still be bosses being downed. Your nerf will not cripple raids forever and ever. <br />
<br />
4. &quot;We're up in the boss' ass dealing with cleaves and such. Therefore we should do more DPS than other (ranged) pure classes, and definitely hybrids&quot;. Bullshit. PvE fights are scripted. We know what we are dealing with. You're not going to just stand in front of the boss getting cleaved. You can predict what's going to happen, and adjust accordingly (especially with DBM). Also, ranged DPS have their troubles as well. It really depends on boss mechanics. Saurfang comes off the top of my head as a fight that caters melee DPS, yet hassles ranged.<br />
<br />
All in all, I believe the nerf was justifiable. Rogues are fucking OP. QQ<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drbutcher</div><div class="date">2010-01-09, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Facts:<br />
<br />
1)Mutilate dps was way too high.<br />
<br />
2)Mutilate is the easiest/most boring dps spec after the SB SB SB locks back in BT/sunwell days.I remember at the start of Wotlk rogues saying i will go muti because its more interesting and not boring as combat.And it was true back then.But after that they changed hunger and rupture went out of rotation.<br />
<br />
3)The excuse i am a melee so i should do more dps is.. an excuse....I am enha shaman.With the way item levels work i have less health than everyone.I am at 20k life with every item being over ilevel 258 except my totem.I also don't have CoS or evasion or vanish or sprint to escape.Guess what.I don't die.(Ok on trashes i die :Pp).Also the casters in mosts fights have other jobs to do as well.And in ICC in the first 6 battles (Haven't seen professor yet.We kept our tries for sunday) almost all benefit melee<br />
<br />
4)The nurf in poisons was unnecessary maybe cause it might drop combat dps way too low.We will see.<br />
<br />
5)Mages atm are more OP than rogues.You don't have any QQ about mages till now cause of 1)It's the first week people will have 2 set bonus unless they went for gloves and shoulders.But most of the people went for shoulders and either head or chest.So it's not the class that needs nurf but the 2set bonus for arcane.2)Most fights till now (in ICC) requires movement from range so they can't show their potential<br />
<br />
6)In general the &quot;hybrids should do less dps&quot; is stupid cause:<br />
a)Noone will get you in a guild as a hybrid because they want you to raid with 3 specs.Applications are like:LF a shadow priest.Looking for a boomkin etc etc.If my guild is looking for a SP and i find someone with the gear/skills i want i will take him .I don't care if he can heal or not.I have recruited healers for this job<br />
b)They bring buffs to the raid.Really? Lets see.In most bosses in ICC you will have 2 tanks 5-6 healers and 17-18 dpsers.Count how many classes you need to cover that buffs.Make the maths and see how many spots are for the hybrids to cover the buffs spots.And after you have covered all the buffs spots what?You want the highest dps inside right?Remind me how many times you have seen guilds recruiting only rogues and locks?Why?Because their dps output was way too high and they were in raid with 4-5 rogues 4-5 locks.Yeap fair....<br />
c)Some of the &quot;pure&quot; classes bring more unique buffs than the hybrids.How many battles require sheep ?How many battles had banish or warlock tanking + the UNIQUE HS and SS?Or kite maybe? Hello hunters.Ah sorry i forgot rogues don't have anything.They don't?Ok go without rogues GL HF killing bosses with interrupts.Do you thing we put rogues to interrupt for fun or MAYBE because the magic school lock is higher?Yes that 1 sec can make the difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
7)For the guy that said combat rogues you are not rogues go play fury well ... they way muti is atm you should go play pacman.It's harder.</div></div><hr />

Reg: All right... all right... but apart from expose armor and the melee damage increase debuff and spell interrupts and crowd control and melee crit chance increase debuff and cast time slowing and enrage removal and whining and trap detection and removal... what can the Rogues do for us? <br />
Xerxes: Bring DPS! <br />
Reg: (very angry, he's not having a good meeting at all) What!? Oh... (scornfully) DPS, yes... shut up! <br />

<br />
Reading a lot of this in the thread.<br />
Funny how this is WOW... &quot;little to no effort&quot; is the mantra of this game.<br />
<br />
If it is so little effort to do what rogues do - reroll.<br />
<br />
What's that? Dont want to?<br />
Yep, that's what I thought you would say. Rogues dont want to swallow nerfs either. Guess who is in the position of disadvantage now?<br />
<br />
&quot;It's justified.&quot;<br />
<br />
... as long as it isnt me, you mean.<br />

&quot;We are weaker as a whole&quot; ~Highlord Tirion Fordring<br />
<br />
<br />
Read through my entire post before commenting on it. You seem to be picking out the odd sentence and attempting to comment on it, without looking at my message on the whole. I'll respond anyway, because I love attention. =D<br />
<br />
I admit, PvE really does not require much skill, for the most part. However, spamming 2 buttons and an occasion third and topping meters...does that not sound silly?<br />
<br />
I don't want to reroll a rogue, because I enjoy my class.<br />
<br />
What disadvantage? You're sitting 1-2k above second place, and like 3k above everyone else. Even post-nerf, you'll be still topping charts, just by a slimmer margin. Of course no one wants to swallow nerfs, but you rogues seem to think it came out of nowhere. <br />
<br />
Again, read through my entire post. Granted, I do not want a nerf on my class. However, enh shamans hardly need a nerf, unlike rogues. <br />
<br />
On the last part, I don't know if it's your signature or a quote for my benefit, but if it's a quote...READ MY GODDAMN POST AGAIN. I went through that part.<br />
<br />
P.S We don't really need a buff either although it would be enjoyed, if you're thinking I believe enh shamans are weak.</div></div><hr />

Would like to see other classes take the same amount of nerf.. Only seen one other class get such a massive hit to the face (BM hunters in TBC and its still shit).<br />
<br />
And yes rogues can CC etc. but how often do you need to use it? The only boss in ICC so far you need a rogue to do interrupts is Lady Death (Frostbolts) and FT in ToGC, and thats not a DPS race..<br />
<br />
10% nerf is just stupid - Why dont they just remove it, and give rogues something else instead.</div></div><hr />

Yea but if you try and click on those players so you get the total DPS from all the raidmembers you can see a feral druid doing 10.5K, and a lock/mage doing 12K, where the rogues 1-2K more.. Is that so bad?<br />
<br />

l2p, instead of QQing... Cause apparently other classes can burst above 10K on Festergut aswell, and they even have to move alot.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but your a moron -.- <br />
I havent played since 3.2 but i can easily see that rogues are way to good compared to the other pures... And why the hell should they do 1-2k+ more dps then the other pures? Warlocks, hunters and mages wont bring more buffs than rogues except conjured water/food and Demo spellpower buff, a poor int buff and stones. (and demo aint the best dps specc)<br />
Lets make rogues the new 3.2SPs/tbcrets and see if you start &quot;QQing&quot; and then well tell you to L2p -.- <br />
<br />
God damn all those rogues who cant understand the feeling of sucking. Just because rogues have always been atleast good. &gt;:( since blizz loves you... QQ<br />
<br />
And no i dont really give a damn about rogues owning, but most likely theres a few ppl who do. :-\ And i dont like morons :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Príckenöveri</div><div class="date">2010-01-09, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, also i fail to see why rogues use the &quot; we are ONLY MEELES PURES FFS&quot; argument. I mean maybe you will take more dmg from aoes etc but does that matter to you ? I mean ure healer heals you anyway right? xD <br />
And atleast getting damaged wont delay ure dps. :-X</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Waladin</div><div class="date">2010-01-09, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the problem was, rogues doing 10k+ DPS on bosses, but as you can see, other classes can aswell.. So instead of QQing people maybee should have a look on their DPS rotation/Gemming/Spec etc. instead. <br />
<br />
And btw, I havent said that rogues are the &quot;ONLY PURE DPS CLASS&quot;, and what i have calculated me to then it is a 15-20% nerf (If you count poisons reduction aswell)</div></div><hr />

<br />
well I tried that with the top few fights and all I saw was places 1-3 all yellow for rogues. There is a lock on the first page doing 12k but that's only for 1 minute of recorded fight (if you look closer, they only recorded the last minute of the fight when Affl. locks have a high-damage 'execute' ability).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mcdougles</div><div class="date">2010-01-10, 04:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I lol'd. Brilliant post, if not quite understanding some things (rogues should only use Expose Armor if there isn't a warrior - and when does that happen? - you don't get the melee damage buff and the crit buff at the same time, and when was the last time you saw disarmable traps in a raid/dungeon in an out of combat situation?)<br />
<br />
The only problem with this is that rogues are the only class in the entire game that don't give a direct &quot;buff&quot; to anyone - and if you count tricks of the trade, then compare that to Trueshot Aura. Or, in Survival's case, Replenishment.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just the psychology of &quot;Oh, I don't do anything to help my allies, I just kill our enemies&quot; going on, but it's still there.<br />
<br />
WTB Rogue version of Heroism/Bloodlust in Cata, PST.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really hope you do get hero/lust down the road, and then take another big nerf to your overall dps since you bring more utility, I'd love to see the reaction to that, be it good or bad.<br />
<br />
Rogues were OP. Face it. My rogue alt started out in combat maces at 80 with two tankards o' terror and then full quest greens/blues and was pulling between 3.5k to 4.5k dps depending on the encounter. That's at least 1k to 2k higher than any of my other 80s when they first dinged including other pure dps classes (2k higher than warlock and 1k higher than hunter). Then when I got him a little more geared up I flipped mutilate and the fireworks flew high to say the least.<br />
<br />
On a side note, anyone saying that hybrids should be pulling less dps than pure dps classes, I really hope down the road one of your alternate trees turns into a tanking/healing tree and you get shoved into that tree based on your own logic. ;D</div></div><hr />

I've seen far too many rogues claiming that they lose sooo much damage using their class utility like it doesnt hinder other pures either. Mages do massive damage while dispelling amirite?<br />
<br />
Take a Marksman hunter for instance. They can spec into imp Hunters Mark, at a personal loss of dps. They can spec into True Shot Aura at a personal loss and it is overwritten by Blood dk's proc buff and Shamans as well. Marksman hunters also regularly use scorpid sting to bring a to hit debuff to bosses if there isnt a druid casting theirs. Thats a dps loss too.<br />
<br />
Too many other pure dps classes to bring up go through the same thing not to mention hybrids. <br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with the some of the posters who accuse rogues of ignoring their utility to do personal dps and nothing else. Quit whining that dps is all you bring and man up. Topping the meters is just one way to get invited to a group. Not the only way.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes I volunteer to take the dps loss talents so my raid can enjoy those buffs. It's not just about your coveted imaginary dps throne you claw for.</div></div><hr />
