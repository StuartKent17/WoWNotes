The Yellow Gems, Blue Gems, and Red Gems pages have (finally) been updated with the 2.1.0 gems. The Meta Gems aren't updated yet because of a small bug, but everything should be fixed in an hour or two.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 12:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know why and don't mean to be picky, but I really don't like the gem pages for some reason, I guess its my fear and hatred of tables.. lol</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I don't like them that much either, this is why it took time to update (and also because the code is totally horrible).<br />
<br />
Thinking of a new version but I'm still trying to figure out how to do it ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea I'm trying to come up with one as well, flash possibly? I'm sure someone on this site knows how to do flash =p<br />
<br />
or possibly just do 2 dropdown boxes, where you choose a prefix (Bright, Bold, etc. and then what stat that specifically adds) and it lists out the gem types that can have that type, their names, wowhead mouseovers, stats, and an icon next to it (have to have icons, its just visually sexy)<br />
<br />
I can possibly do a Visual Basic roughdraft if needed &gt;&lt; gah I'm a VB nerd =p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 06:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">More like something in PHP/SQL where you could check boxes to hide gems with stats you don't need.<br />
<br />
Like show only gems with strength and stamina, show only gems with attack power, etc ...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 07:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that would work, just something a bit more interactive would be nice, seeing a flat table is an eyesore in this day and age..<br />
<br />
I blame Myspace, and all its internet drama and HTML Fundamental destroying-ness</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arjan</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">don't be stupid i saw those sites and hate since you can naver see what thas jewel do till you clicked in drop down menu and that is a pain n the ass.<br />
<br />
with your design ( ok not 1 of the hardes i think ^^ ) you can easily see everything so i like it bou <br />
<br />
good job</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's the main reason actually, you can't get any list without having to mouseover everything, or go through filters, just need to get something a bit more dynamic with nearly the same layout ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wraythe</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 01:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a heads up..go check the list because last I checked Vileblade of the Betrayer wasnt a red gem ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arjan</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">something like this bou ? http://wowgems.jponrails.com/cut_gems/list</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-07-08, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">@Arjan : Actually, yes, didn't know the site but that's a bit like what I had in mind, but with less filters.<br />
<br />
@Wraythe : Fixed :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zakenfein</div><div class="date">2007-07-09, 05:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was thinking it would be cool to have the icon for the gem next to it to make it more aesthetically (sp?) pleasing. pretty picute + words = win ;D</div></div><hr />
