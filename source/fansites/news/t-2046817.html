Addon - HandyNotes Legion Rares and Treasures<br />
Now is a good time to install the Legion plugin (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes_legionrarestreasures) for HandyNotes (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/handynotes)! It includes not only the rares and treasures in the Broken Isles, but the ones in the Demon Hunter starting area as well. <br />

<br />
Addon - Camera Zoom Fix<br />
This addon (https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/stop-reseting-my-camera-please) sets the camera zoom distance to max every time you log in, saving you from having to manually enter the console command and fix your zoom level until a patch stops the resetting. <br />

Legion Release and Events<br />
this isn't fair for us in europe..we have to wait more and avoid spoilers..SHAME!<br />
Unlocking everything requires a maintenance, alas. But the roles will be reversed in 21 days... (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/763052180442001409))<br />
so you mean there will be no time difference?<br />
Legion unlocks in Europe ~9 hours before it does in NA, since it's the 30th there before it is here. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/763056591293648896))<br />
<br />
is Dalaran event going to be available after aug 30 or only those who log in on launch day will be part of it?<br />
Everything is available after 8/30 except demon invasions. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763042296119955456))<br />
including all broken shore questline? I thought they weren't going to be available after 8/3! thanks!<br />
They are shortcut so you can get into BI faster, but you can go back and do everything by talking to Archivist Elysiana in Dalaran (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763042773742161920))<br />
<br />
Wasn't the quest with Jaina leaving Dalaran supposed to be today, or am I wrong?<br />
Next week (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763108300078538752))<br />
<br />
Ravika (5.3 vendor) only spawns for lvl 100+ Horde on Broken Shore quest - Alliance can't get cosmetic shoes. Intended?<br />
Horde also get Fo'rum the Postmaker, Alliance get a Lucky Shirt vendor and Alaina's Bonnet (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763146384472104960))<br />
Note to Horde players: Fo'rum's posts are not bound, sell an angry post to an Alliance player today! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763166827904061440))<br />
<br />
The limited time items: anything for Nethershards, Invasion weapons (looking in to the drop rate), Pocket Fel Spreader. That's it. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763237523392831488))<br />
Pocket Fel Spreader will be unattainable for those of us who preordered physical CE rather than digital right? Can't afford both <br />
Nope! Anyone can fight an ousted Dreadlord. You just need to be able to locate demons (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763240122443706370))<br />
<br />
DO demon invasions get harder as Legion gets closer? or just more common?<br />
Intensity increases by 300% each week (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763242903309168640))<br />
<br />
Are you required to do the Broken Shores scenario before starting Legion? Or can you skip it on your alts and go into the action?<br />
.After 8/30, once you've seen Dalaran teleport, you can skip everything on your alts and go right to dalaran and start artifacting (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763426018279370752))<br />
any way to get nethershard vendor now on alts without doing broken shore 11 more times?<br />
Illidari vendors should be present in all zones where invasions occur all the time with the goods. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/763445911364116480))<br />
<br />
Camera<br />
Any updates regarding the zoom speed bug? I'm currently playing like this to avoid the worst of it:<br />
It isn't a bug but a deliberate change. It'll take a future patch to introduce a CVar to allow fine-tuning of adjustment speed. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/763413605844865025))<br />

Legion - Mechanized Lumber Extractor<br />
The Mechanized Lumber Extractor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140500-mechanized-lumber-extractor) mount is a reward of the Remember to Share (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11176-remember-to-share) achievement for collecting 300 toys. If you don't want to collect all of those toys, the Sky Golem (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95416-sky-golem) is a very similar option. <br />

<br />
He's using the name that the author who made the WoD one was to gain popularity. It's like me making an addon called &quot;Deadly Boss Mods - Warlords of Draenor Mods&quot; before DBM can, forcing them to use a different name, even though they have it for every other expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a very generic name, there is no &quot;unique&quot; name in that addon name, other then HandyNotes. Anyone could come up with that. Hey I'm making a HandyNotes plugin to track Treasures in Legion. HandyNotes_LegionTreasures sound ok? Its the most simplistic name for such an addon anyone could come up with.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that he has previously used the achievement names in his addon names, like HandyNotes_LostAndFound for MoP and HandyNotes_TreasureHunter for WoD. As it happens, Legion has no &quot;special&quot; achievement name for all treasures, they are all just named &quot;Treasures of Azsuna&quot; etc, so it would even still keep up with that history.</div></div><hr />

No, having an addon that ruins any need to find things yourself kills the feeling of adventure, questing is better now than it was in say vanilla</div></div><hr />

Ah yes, vanilla leveling that was great, super ''difficult'' quests that told you to go to the other side of the world and then come back and the quest line ends without giving you a quest to go somewhere else. Great fun jk</div></div><hr />

I dispel UA off myself all the time because it really doesn't do that much damage. Stop listening to the bad players cry about how strong Warlocks are. They are extremely trainable.

LOLWUT, I Dispelled an UA off a buddy and got hit back for 220k. You're full of it.</div></div><hr />

Discipline pries with 2 stacks of focused will, 16% versatility, and toss up a shield, plus rolling atonement heals. Dispelling UA isnt a big deal on live.</div></div><hr />

So with 30% damage reduction, plus 8% damage reduction, plus a 100k shield, and heals ON TOP of that, make it okay?!<br />
You shouldn't have to prep with nearly 40% damage reduction and a 100k shield to dispel 1 spell that can be instantly re-applied.</div></div><hr />
