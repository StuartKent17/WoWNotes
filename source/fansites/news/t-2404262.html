With every expansion, our musical mages reach deep down into their souls and summon a tableau of sound to accompany your next adventure. Building upon a variety of musical themes from World of Warcraft over the years, composer Glenn Stafford has infused his magic into the new main title for Battle for Azeroth, “Before the Storm.” Sit back, relax, and let the music carry you into the heart of Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

Cata&gt;BC&gt;Vanilla&gt;Wrath&gt;WoD&gt;BFA&gt;Legion&gt;MoP. <br />

Cata is far ahead for me, BC, Vaninlla, Wrath and WoD are pretty close.</div></div><hr />

I know that one plays during the BfA cinematic when Sylvanas is on-screen, but the one right at the end plays specifically during Forsaken/Sylvanas moments in the Before the Storm audiobook. Definitely has this huge, eerie &quot;Sylvanas&quot; vibe to it as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Illusions</div><div class="date">2018-06-15, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, the worst Login screen score thus far, though I don't remember most that well anyway. MOP remains my favourite to date. The small changes to thematic Warcraft melodies seemed arrogant to me, thus the melodies for first half were more than irritating, with a big deal being same-y. One plus side is that there's no X thing to race for, but this can yet be changed with the login screen reveal.<br />
<br />
The second half started changing things up finally, but nothing really was too notable or memorable, with very abrupt transitions around the eight minute mark and a random outro. It's clear Russell Brower did not work on this, and it is a sad fact - his absence is really telling.<br />
<br />
And it's not really about being asshole-y, it's just my opinion. No need for positive echo chambers.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I agree with this. It's not bad but it does have a lot going on at once, especially in the beginning. And then it just ends. Oh Russel Brower, you will be missed.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, Russell will be missed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but I just don’t get all the negativity that runs rampant in this site. Have never really mentioned it before in my posts that I can recall, over the years. Just gets to me sometimes. Guess everyone’s entitled to their own opinion though. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Review: Great themes in it! I love how it starts out as &quot;there's a storm coming and you hear Anduin's theme which represents the Alliance's vengeance and cry for retribution then we get Sylvanas' theme which represents the Undercity being sieged right before you hear the Horde's theme when they charge off.&quot; Other than that the transitions are very random and should flow better. It sounds more like a composition of themes rather than the past ones. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dunkl</div><div class="date">2018-06-15, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This song ties together all the dear inhabitants, curious races, diverse cultures and deep, changing histories spread across countless quiet and bustling but always exciting homelands of Azeroth, and how they are ALL interwoven in a tale of consequence so deep and in a story of peace and beauty so deserving. <br />
<br />
This song captures the impact of how we're all affected by and connected to one another. Each character. Every traveler, child, creature or king will play a part in the war to come, and the inevitable harmony that is to come after. <br />
<br />
This song welcomes us with heart, to uncover mysteries both dark yet hopeful This song invites us to adventure across the sea sprayed winds on grand wooden ships, with unmatched exhilaration, for discovery and if need be, battle. This song welcomes us into deep, misty jungles, surrounded by unfamiliar noises, echoing chirps and distant rumbles. <br />
<br />
This song urges us through mindful exploration, intense determination and strong, selfless love, to embark on the next, but more importantly, a different kind of perilous and exciting journey. Each and every one of us will be called on to defend, to sacrifice, to pray or to mend. Our world, our home, Azeroth, has been the battleground for much conflict. In the days ahead, that mere conflict erupts and becomes a war. This story unfolding on and in Azeroth sees us and our fellow inhabitants interacting in ways we often only see glimpses of. Without a unifying external threat, we are focused on ourselves and the harm done to our planet. Azeroth is injured, we must deal with that. A powerful substance emerges, we must deal with that as well. We will soon be at full on war and will have to deal with that.  Never before have we had such an interesting intimate story involving us and only us. <br />
<br />
We are all connected, from the plump and jolly Tuskarr to the shadowy and keen-eyed Arakkoa, from the mighty and misunderstood Mok'nathal to the clever and quick Vulpera. From joyfilled Dryads prancing merrily through lush glades to hard-at-work clockwork Gnomes. From fallen leaders; Cairne, Vol'jin and Varian, to happy children running playfully through the cozy cobblestone streets of a magic city, from singing sunflowers and powerful dragons to harmonious bear-folk, antlered ancestors, dome-hidden Elves, from brutish Ogres to fierce Naga. From islands hidden by walls of mist, and longstanding castles and kingdoms, to exotic cities of gold, and portals to other planets. From spears to bows to butterfly nets. Every stone, every pond ripple, every breath and beating heart, every elemental plain, every loa, every chi, even undeath, we are all connected. This story cannot be told or won by one alone, it will take everything to tell this story - our story. Let's work together to allow the story to unfold, and heal our dying world. <br />
<br />
This song beckons that the world is here before us, in and around us, and reminds us that we are not separate from it. Every individual has a part in it's story. We are one of our world's many breathtaking landscapes, as ever changing as the oceans, as capable as the winds. If Azeroth is home to all of us, then let us all be home to love. Azeroth slumbers so that we may awaken. It may take the final hour of the crumbling and quaking of our home to shake us into doing what we absolutely must. Let us try, together, with all of our heart's combined strengths so that we may one day wake up, fix our breaking, warring world, let go, and move on. <br />
<br />
It also makes me think of exhilaratingly swinging from crow's nests and cautiously chopping my way through deep, lush jungles! <br />

I think 4:43 is the swirling, dark cold of Azshara.﻿</div></div><hr />

Why would they include music from the expansion just gone in it thoigh :,,,,,,,) they only include classic music bc most find it nostalgic.<br />
<br />
They included the Varian theme which is from Legion. It's common to include previous expansion themes into the opening song. I actually would've loved it more if they added the Horde/Sylvannas cinematic theme.</div></div><hr />

On top of that, it's just a wall of sound for the first couple of minutes. It's just layer after layer of noise.<br />
<br />
Listening to it a couple more times, I think that's the main issue - they'd sometimes put the melody in there but some composer on their roster went : &quot;WE NEED TO BURY IT IN CHANTS. NO, MEN'S CHORUS - NO, SECOND PART FLUTE HARMONY&quot; and whatever melody that was supposed to represent that segment ends up getting thrown under. <br />
<br />
The segment from 7:00-8:00 or so is an exception and more typical of their standard pieces.<br />
<br />
The whole vanilla soundtrack was just phenomenal. They started out with really noticeable melodic lines you could follow and were just powerful. I'm not sure what's going on here. The ambience pieces from vanilla made better themes than what we have now.</div></div><hr />

Love that cinematic, and the music is the reason that makes it so good. <br />
<br />
Music is the thing in the game that I think is always awesome. Even in WoD. Legion got it as well. Highmountain, Suramar and Azsuna are my favorites. Before the Storm is okay. But BfA got some awesome music in it, some of the best ever. The one in my signature is pure gold. Part of it was in this one. And the Freehold/Kul Tiras music is also awesome.

I think it's the typical &quot;power creep&quot; over time. They want it to be epic, more epic than the last, even more epic than the last even more epi...<br />

<br />
I don't mind a mixture of new and old. MoP and Legion did this very well. MoP had a lot of Cata stuff in it, and Legion took a lot of good stuff from WoD. I like when they use some past expac stuff mixed with something from the newer zones for the current expansion. <br />
<br />
To me, BFA theme starts off okay, I like the tone it set, but it's just super boring, has nothing interesting to keep it going. Like go back to Legion one, when that Anduin theme hit, you were ready to play, also I forgot the name of the song but towards the end just takes your breath away.</div></div><hr />

And I think my initial reaction was flavored by a terrible first two minutes. It gets a little better after that, and then 6:20-8:00, the Kul Tiras theme, is really tickling my fancy. I also went back to the other main themes and found this to be true for them as well- with the exception of vanilla's iconic intro, the others had some of the most forgettable or noisy segments out front, burying their thematic highlights further into the track.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they have always mixed previous expansion themes together, but this... It just jumps around without any connection to previous segment and blares in your ears.<br />
