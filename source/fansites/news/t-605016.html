<br />
it's just that everyone who's spending 5d/6h in raids will look like a complete dumbass and/or psychopath having equip with slightly superior stats while those who do kara/za/heroics will look like a rnd bt guy. so you can still tell the difference(casuals having like 8 spd less on their pvp-amu cuz they got the pvp-version while the raiders have the one from two demon-goat-hos). it's all about the looks now i guess. problem is that right now, blizz does also give a shit about the looks<br />

<br />
as for me, im a rogue, some new swords would be much more interesting then shitty daggers.<br />
<br />
But maybe, when i take a look at the names of the rings, the badges loot table isnt finished yet and there are some swords going to be added.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The caster weapon gives considerably worse DPS than the Zul'jin sword for my build, the robes are decent, but I by the time this patch is out we'll either be killing illidan or very close to.<br />
<br />
<br />
For those not in BT, this stuff will be a nice stepping-stone, but once you hit BT loot it's all just... meh.<br />

WAKE THE FUCK UP;<br />
Lovely, TBC been out for 12 months, and now everybody get epics instead of greens, 7 months before WotLK release.<br />
<br />
So that's about 58% of TBC that is going mental kindergarden mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dude, its a game not a life. again approx. 10% of the WoW gaming population is at or around BT Raiding level, If the game is going more casual in your opinion and others of the like who cares, Blizzard is aiming to move the game along and make the MAJORITY happy, not the very few. If your so angry over the changes or the lack thereof, the only one you have to be angry of is yourself. For whatever Hype you built up in your own pathetic mind or not bothering to find a better challenge elsewhere. Honestly Id love to see the elitists ases such as yourself leave, WoW and the gaming community would be so much better off. <br />
<br />
In closure all things change, this will all be Dead material with the release of Xpac2. Whats the point in keeping the original challenge upon its creation when virtually everyone will not be raiding said instances with WotLK's release? BTW TBC has been out over 13 months now, and this is still very early in the TEST phase. By the time this goes live, BT/Hyj would likely been out a year. Get over yourself.</div></div><hr />

So there is no point to get any gear whatsoever in WoTLK, because there will be another expansion afterwards.<br />
<br />
Nice logic you got there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Man you just open the door... Do you bother to think before you type? Clearly not your above statement only shows how narrow minded you truly are and your comment has no relevance to my statement. So let me break it down for you so you can comprehend what it meant. WoW = Game, Game = Fun/Entertainment. The time line of BT/Hyj being live has nothing to do with the progression of SWP. The point regarding WotLK was to only show how pointless your QQ over the Gear additions, Raid Attunement lifts is pointless. Get the gear and have fun, but hey if you want to party in your T6 lvl 70 gear at lvl 80 be my guest. The rest of us will be on to bigger and better things and TBC will be a memory at best.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LegendsnDreamz</div><div class="date">2008-02-19, 03:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And to make it a bit more clear:<br />
<br />
I play for the content, the bosses and their background lore.<br />
I play for the challenge, the challenge that provides fun for me and my guild.<br />
<br />
I do NOT fucking play for farming badges over and over again.<br />
I couldn't care less about doing a instance more than once, but the game is not designed to be so pathetic easy that you can do that.<br />
<br />
After you killed a boss atleast once, the only reason you repeat him/her is because you need the LOOT from the said boss, to progress. And often because you can't fucking skip it to progress to the next boss.<br />
<br />
I'm quite sure alot of raiders would be happy with the ability to skip directly to Mother Shahraz in BT, and Azgalor in Hyjal.<br />
Did 2.4 allow that? NO, it did fucking not.<br />
<br />
Special when 2.4 is focused on farming the END BOSSES of SSC,TK,MH,BT to open up for Sunwell bosses.<br />
Go read up on Essence of the Immortals, you clearly don't have a clue about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your just contradicting all your other previous whining posts, if the above is truly what your look to take from this game. you wouldn't be crying over a patch and focusing on the most smallest details. You would instead play the game, go through and appreciate the content/lore and move on when you have bested the content that is currently out. Instead you are here bitching about Joe Schmo doing the content in a different manner then you. people that has no impact on your gaming experience especially if your attached to a guild that you regularly raid with. <br />
<br />
And Please stop trying to challenge my knowledge of the game and the content being TESTED, I for one havent even brought it up or tried to show how big my EPEEN is, and if your going to post have relevance to the comments made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
if you notice, most melee classes use/need 2 weapons and the choices for those slots are very limited and unattractive for non-swords or non-rogues. Healers, on the other hand have limited MH choices and good offhand choices<br />
<br />
Then again anyone with illidan on farm and possessing the class of rogue would be dumb to use anything other than swords cause blizzard hasn't figured out after months and months of repeated evidence that daggers and fists need a pve buff, while swords need to remain how they are(not nerfing sspec). 1.50 speed weapons are not the best for rogues, especially not dagger rogues. The 1.50 sword from Kalecgos for instance is a downgrade from the 1.40 sword from Mother<br />

<br />
So will the 90% other raiders, and sunwell won't be accessable for another year on my server. Finally a GM will open it, and it'll be removed on future realms. And I got alot of pvp epeen in the mean time.<br />
<br />
It's starting to remind me of AQ40. I understand why some guilds wouldn't let the rest of the realm partisipate in the opening event, because they didden't care to help open the gates.<br />
<br />
You should be able to see this DO have a freaking impact on everybodys experience.<br />
If you think that you can do anything without it having a impact on anybody else on your realm, you're wrong.<br />

Again you comment on my posts w/o having any relevance or evidence you read or comprehended what I typed. If you dont like doing heroics, DON'T DO THEM, plain and simple man. If there is something in this game you personally do not like doing just don't do it. Just cause there options out there does not mean you have to do it all and like it. This is the World of Warcraft, not the World of Windcape. Where O please where does it say that I am a casual that wants everything handed to me and does not participate with world events? No where! Im a hardcore raider and I have a couple 70 raiding toons on the Test server TESTING the content that will go live at some point. Im just so compelled to comment on your Nazisms, to show not all of us Hardcore Raiders have the elitist attitude you think we all do. I Know its a game and have fun with it and hope everyone that pays to play does too. If joe schmo doesnt want to help unlock something, who cares he/she is getting what they pay for. If it takes a little longer O well, You always have the option to move to a server that better suits your needs. Or find a game that does so. Please do.

Prices are high, yes. But still, they are for casuals. Ambitious casuals doing heroics and Karazhan/ Zul Aman. Don't think that it is for free.

<br />
QUOTED FOR TRUTH!<br />
<br />
And,...@ General Flamers:<br />
<br />
I've cleared Naxxramas and I've been in BT and Hyjal so I don't categorize myself as casual,... I don't play casually. But what Blizzard is doing right now is exactly the right thing to do. <br />
<br />
Why do I think so? Epic's are not a privilege. Rank 14 was. Why do I compare? Let's say it the following way. In WoW classic I spend by far more time doing PvP than most of those who turned R14. I just didn't spend this amount of time in just 2-3 months straight. So basically I invested the same amount of time but I've never been R14. <br />
<br />
A casual that has enough time to spare over let's say a month, that equals the time nihilum needed to clear something shoudn't be rewarded the same but in a comparable way that the raiders were rewarded in(I mean farming ZA and Karazhan every ID) -&gt; Not the same, because the difficulty of obtaining those items is higher, but comparable like I said. <br />
<br />
Those items are exactly what they should be. Casuals just need little bit longer to obtain those (little bit worse) but comparable items. <br />
<br />
In addition to that, you cannot prevent retards(whoever this might be in your opinion, he has another) from getting that gear but you also cannot prevent a retard from being a millionaire and u not in rl can u?<br />
<br />
We had exactly the same situation in wow classic where R14 gear was given away for a few Honor Points before the expansion came. Did it hurt anybody in the end? No, it just felt wierd to know you worked for the rank 14 gear rly hard and now everybody has it,..but wait,... it took almost 1.5 years for a casual to be able to finally get that gear,...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Keep the majority of the player base happy. They're able to further their toons without investing massive amounts of hours into raiding.<br />
2. To fill those missing slots for raiders. You'll be getting badges off the bosses anyway, this way you won't be hanging out for an upgrade forever and missing it when it when it drops and you're subbed. You'll beable to progress your raid performance without getting lucky drops.</div></div><hr />

WTB 25man badge. I just don't get the handing over T6 loot to folks that don't even intend to go into a 25man zone, so they can clear the nerfed heroics even faster? Whatever, hopefully it makes some folks happy. The x-bow does kill me though, I'm tired of the everyone has the same melee and ranged weapon thing.

I really do like that quote ;)<br />
Speaks so much of a truth...<br />
I do agree at some point, that these stuff is pretty hard! i mean, look at the ring - it's better than anything in the game (speaking as a SV Hunter here) except the Hyjal-Exalted Version ^^<br />
However this is good because this way more players get access to better gear. Twinks can equip themselfes even faster, etc...<br />
<br />
I just need to find some people to do heroics and kara now :P<br />
Even with my halfT6 hunter i gonna do kara because i freaking want this ring :P</div></div><hr />

Not really. T3 wasn't replaced until Kara gear (I've seen a lock with 1k spell damage in all 60 T3 gear). They've also said that there won't be as much of a gear curve in WotLK. So GG for *YOU,* I doubt these will be replaced until at least lvl80 heroic loot.</div></div><hr />

ie allowing casuals to get gear not as good as the raiding content gear but of comparable level, which will help top guilds to recruit and casuals to do whatever they like to do (and give offspecs some gear without crowding loot tables).<br />
And the top raiders will have enjoyed content/gear level for 6 months/1 year before the casual did get access to them.<br />
<br />
That's obviously the pattern Blizzard is going with since they introduced badge gear, so please get over it.</div></div><hr />

Or just nolife yourself in exile for 3-4 weeks straight, 5-8hrs/day where you base your gaming only on doing heroics (having established a group with mates whenever you're online).<br />
<br />
Say, 5 heroics (daily heroic included) a day.<br />

Why? Because the casual gamer is a large portion of their market and when that game *cough*warhammer*cough* is released they are anticipating it to steal, atleast for a short while, (until WotLK?) a majority of the minority (hardcore gamers). <br />
<br />
Imo WotLK will return to the pre &quot;casual market&quot; ways and once again be appealing to the hardcore/serious gamer. But for now... try not to drown in badges :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chibi</div><div class="date">2008-02-19, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely understand why they are doing this. It would really suck for new guilds having to farm Karazhan then Gruul, Mag, SSC/TK to get to BT. Progressing through really old content sucks and it's usually hard for guilds to survive through that for too long.<br />
<br />
Yes, everyone else farmed Karazhan for ages to have gear for Gruul and Magtheridon at the start, but then that content was new and not as unexciting as it is now. Then there was time to spend time on that, back when people didn't even know where Nether Vortexes dropped...<br />
<br />
This way people don't have to farm for ages to get to MH/BT, which isn't so bad...they still have to make an effort to get there. Now the veterans can move on to the new instance, SWP, while the casuals can start finish off SSC/TK and start MH/BT.<br />
<br />
After seeing how Naxxramas went, I'm not against this. Seeing an instance go to waste like that because only about 5% ever got to do the last bosses in there.<br />
<br />
I feel they're taking it a bit too far this time though...those badge items are a bit too good, they should be more on par with tier5 items, less on par with tier6 quality items, IMO.</div></div><hr />

As its been quoted many times now, i've had my T6 and twin welfare legendaries for 6 months. I've killed so many people with them now i forget. I really dont mind that the general public that PAY for the servers i play on have a chance to get comparable gear. It's still going to take them 2 months after SWP is released. I estimate they have at least another 3-4 months to play with their gear until WotLC comes out, by which time i'll have far superior gear than them for another 6 months at level 80 until the cycle repeats itself.<br />

you think that is casual? my mom has a druid and recently hit lvl20, now that I think is casual. for my sister though and the rest of the family, they think she has gone nuts and is a hard core wow gamer. so now guess what they think of every day raiding and a 100days + played time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hold on there, what else did they do?<br />
Added more badge rewards, added more dungeon drops (MT), and added a new 25man end raid.<br />
So who has it bad..?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrostemplar</div><div class="date">2008-02-19, 11:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I completely understand why they are doing this. It would really suck for new guilds having to farm Karazhan then Gruul, Mag, SSC/TK to get to BT. Progressing through really old content sucks and it's usually hard for guilds to survive through that for too long.<br />
<br />
Yes, everyone else farmed Karazhan for ages to have gear for Gruul and Magtheridon at the start, but then that content was new and not as unexciting as it is now. Then there was time to spend time on that, back when people didn't even know where Nether Vortexes dropped...<br />
<br />
This way people don't have to farm for ages to get to MH/BT, which isn't so bad...they still have to make an effort to get there. Now the veterans can move on to the new instance, SWP, while the casuals can start finish off SSC/TK and start MH/BT.<br />
<br />
After seeing how Naxxramas went, I'm not against this. Seeing an instance go to waste like that because only about 5% ever got to do the last bosses in there.<br />
<br />
I feel they're taking it a bit too far this time though...those badge items are a bit too good, they should be more on par with tier5 items, less on par with tier6 quality items, IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually it would be nice this was the reason (or not, because is just a somewhat valid reason - the raiding ladder is there for people to experience it, not to bypass it).<br />
<br />
But no - the reason that the Badge rewards are what they are is the S2 honor and S4 Arena gear. That basically destroy instance drops up to BT or so. So Blizzard either: <br />
a) forego of PVE itemization (and lose a lot of money)<br />
b) reitemize PVE drops of Gruul/Mag/SSC/TK<br />
c) introduce badge rewards<br />
<br />
Guess which on is easier to do? Guess which on they chose?<br />
<br />
The root of all issues lies at PVP gear. Static vs dynamic, remember?<br />
<br />
Personally, I want a main weapon. 150 badges (for the Scryer blade of focus) or the reduced Arena Points? Or downgrade a bit and just go for the honor based S2 that I can get in a weekend?<br />
<br />
The problem is not the badge rewards per se.<br />
<br />
On a side note, are the caster sets made for locks? No spirit whatsoever? With the new spirit it could be interesting...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does anyone realize that the current badge loot is already tier 5.5 quality for many classes and items? <br />
<br />
For example for druid tanks, http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33583, http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33580 and http://www.wowhead.com/?item=33582 is on par and in some cases even better than BT/Hyjul loot. This is the case for many of the current badge loot for all classes and this loot was released a long time ago.<br />
<br />
Why are people just now getting their panties in a bunch? I actually think that the new badge gear, (version 3), have you, is less of an upgrade than version 2 was to 1. I'm shocked I am the first person to be qq'ing on it's lack of quality instead of saying how op it is.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fugazi</div><div class="date">2008-02-19, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">More QQ please! :'(<br />
<br />
1) Casual<br />
Ah yes sure, 150 badges for weapon = month of daily heroics or 2 months of karazhan. Instead you can just get S3 weapon if you have enough gold, S1+ gear, some skill and people willing to boost on your server. It will take you 3 games first 3 weeks and then ~40 games last week for personal rating. Not even counting that few weeks after 2.4 S4 will come out so you will be able to get superior weapons that way or get S3 weapons for 10 games in 5v5 for 2-3 months.<br />
<br />
2) BoJ loot<br />
Not optimized (speeds for example), missing loads of items (for example prot warrior missing new &quot;BT&quot;: weapon, shield, helm etc.).<br />
<br />
This is loot for T5 guilds than casuals. T4/T5 guilds will have now a lot badges to spend (2 per boss per week?) and those items are sweet upgrades somehow or if you were unlucky with fucking gay RNG (Talon of Azshara not dropping for months for me when I was raiding = NOT FUN).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, at least as a warrior, I will destroy any warrior in T6/whatever PvE gear when I complete my S3/S4 gear. This may not matter on PvE servers, but you will probably feel that on PvP servers while leveling in wotlk. THAT is main problem with PvE gear = for many classes it is useless in PvP. Even that I stopped raiding I do not like it, raiders putted more time and should get gear that is at least equal in PvP. With resilience in game it will not gonna happen (unless resilience will have PvE effect - and I am not talking about tanks).</div></div><hr />

its true, kara/za or even heroics and you can easily catch up to be geared for current content without bothering your guild into running the old t4/t5 content. 630 is a lot, dunno if you will need all those pieces tho :D</div></div><hr />

All this time I thought Windcape was in one of those guilds that downed Illidan a few weeks after BT was released, and he's just gotten sick of farming gear from him.<br />
<br />
Haha.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hahaha.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So this guys has really got no legs to stand on with his elitist attitude? I mean, he'll also be one of the people benefitting from the BoJ gear, so his guild can finally kill Illidan.<br />
<br />
That's pretty pathetic, Windcape. That's like people telling others to l2p when they have 1700 ratings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well i have an elitist attitude too... <br />
windcape, i guess if one starts a bit later like the rest, it's alright to have thateven though bt ain't clear. i think being in bt is legs enough to stand, just not as good legs as many thought, no?<br />
<br />
and yeah, pyrostemplar is right- blizzard gave us the raiding ladder <br />
<br />
and atleast i thought it was the way we had to go. now they kinda tell everyone it's okay to just go around some of the towns on the map. <br />
i thought it was reasonable to do it. and also: if you're playing for the content, this IS the way to go. it's just that blizz wants everyone to see the later content and not the older one which i can understand. and you CAN experience older content later( we never downed sapph back then in vanilla and when illy was down we just kinda rushed through the 4 wings and whoop- sapph and kel down). but it didn't feel right even so.<br />
<br />
i have no problems with other people getting to see the content, getting items. just don't like it to see people running around with stuff i kinda worked harder for...<br />
<br />
ah, and: i meant 5d/6h- i don't think you always raided for 6hours @ answer on my last post. we now also only do 2 days, i just meant when new content is out</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CreativeInstitute</div><div class="date">2008-02-19, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well think of it this way, they're trying to get more people to play the raids they made. Take a guess at how many people will be doing SSC/TK/MH/BT when WotLK is released? They know once the expansion is out, people will simply stop doing those raids (just like how people don't do MC/BWL/AQ40/Naxx now unless it's a random thing for fun).<br />
<br />
They'd rather push people through and let players see the raids, because now is the time that people will bother doing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
They've only got a few months to try to get players into BT and Sunwell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember what happened to Naxxramas? Such a small amount of people played it that they're having to reintroduce it in WotLK. It looks like Blizzard don't want that to happen again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW isn't and never was fair.<br />
It's all about memememegievgievgievgiev.<br />
&quot;Casuals&quot; or whatever you call them think that it's not fair that they don't get shiny epics.<br />
&quot;Hardcore Raiders&quot; or whatever you call them think it's not fair that those &quot;n00bs&quot;, whatever, get equal gear with less effort.<br />
<br />
I personally don't know what to think about this. On the one hand I'm glad that I can get better gear so I don't have to wait for the karatresh chest to drop and have the chance to see Illidan. On the other hand SSC/Eye was very disappointing because it's so damn easy and takes no dedication (e.g. farming resistance gear, sucks on the one hand, but it's also cool that you can say &quot;I did something for the group&quot;).<br />
<br />
I took a pause because of exams and started raiding again at the beginning of the year. We downed Vashj last sunday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The cloth is almost all loaded with +hit. That might be good for an item here or there but wearing it all would put you above the hit cap.<br />
There are gloves that are +crit/+dam, but they aren't much better (any better?) than the studious wraps that have been available for months via badges.<br />
The one-handed caster sword is expensive, not as good as the Hyjal sword, and comparable to the sword off ZJ (post 2.4).<br />
<br />
<br />
Just like making the blue set available for honor, this is just a way to get new people up and running faster. There isn't time for them to slowly work the path from Kara--&gt;SSC--&gt;TK--&gt;MH--&gt;BT--&gt;SW that the early people did. What was the biggest complaint about Naxx? That even most raiding guilds never got to finish it because it came out too soon before the expansion.<br />
<br />
Would people prefer that Blizzard release the Sunwell and then hold the expansion for 1 year to allow a reasonable percentage of people to finish it? If your answer is only 1% of the population should ever see it, you aren't thinking like a game designer or a company that wants to make money.<br />
<br />
Relax. The badge loot isn't that good. It may make SSC/TK loot less attractive but guess what? With current badge/Kara/ZA gear, I don't really care about anything in SSC/TK at all, anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
gogogogogogo! rather than make a meaningless post i'll pick on my good friend windcape :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We figured that with the gear they released in the Zul'Aman patch. I never belived they would extend it to this level of insanity.<br />
<br />
Iknow people who allready last summer had over 100 badges they couldn't use in the bank. The extend they could have collected untill now would be massive.<br />
<br />
And I'm not changing opinion, it's not fair , and will never be fair, that you can get BT level items from doing easy heroics, or karazhan. <br />
<br />
<br />
what you always seem to miss is not the gear itself, but the timeframe in which you get it...<br />
<br />
BT level gear from kara badges would suck if no one had illidan down, at best people will be getting some BT gear when sunwell is out, however sunwell gear will still be better than it, as BT gear was better than the ZA badge gear. while it is easier to get it still requires some time (2 hr runs but its something) and its not on par with sunwell gear, or at least shouldn't be.<br />
<br />
think TBC launch, gear resets. blizzard isn't necessarily doing gear resets but allowing anyone to catch up with pvp and pve for each major content patch. for instance my alt mage should be 70 soon, ill grind out tailoring and either enchanting or JC and buy a bunch of crafted gear and get attuned to kara for some badge gear, and hopefully be caught up enough to do PvE (the reason i rolled her).<br />
<br />
if it weren't for badge loots i have zero chance of getting into t5/t6 content with kara gear (t5 doesn't exist on my server, and t6 i would never get being that undergeared) and ever catching up to get into sunwell with my guild. this doesn't apply to alts only, but people returning to the game or pvp'ers and pve'ers who wish to switch it up and explore other aspects of the game.<br />
<br />
lastly, i had 150 badges last summer, doing heroics CONSTANTLY. i loved to tank them, they were a challenge for a warrior in a mix of t4/badge/heroic epics and some blues. how do you think i feel about these free badges given to kara and 25 mans next patch and heroic dailies and nerfed dailies. the longer something exists in this game the easier it will become to farm, that is a simple truth. it always requires more time to do it first, but doing it first is the reason a lot of people do it.</div></div><hr />

i work on content all day that 99.99% of the world will never see, as long as i get paid for doing my job i could care less :D<br />
<br />
also i suppose designing encounters in a game is more rewarding than what i do.<br />
<br />
@windcape:<br />
as for 1% exclusive content, maybe something where pve bosses drop specific loots for the first few weeks after being released, or an increased drop rates on things like warglaives, where there is some reward in doing it first or doing it early. after that open it up to the rest of the wow population. i enjoy seeing mh/bt as a casual raider/pvp'er and hope to see sunwell as well before WotLK, and i don't mind waiting to see it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">benegesserit</div><div class="date">2008-02-19, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard is concerned about the amount of content players are not able to see due to the annoying aspect of farming isntances and attunement processes that slow people down. They see how they screwed up in vanilla, which is why they are re-releasing Naxx. But in TBC, they are probably trying to fix it before the xpack.<br />
<br />
You will never be able to deny, no matter how much you love raiding, the fact that there are FAR more people who are not in BT/Hyjal than those who are. Blizzard will spend the majority of their efforts on the majority of their gamers. It that doesn't make blatantly obvious sense, delete your toon and go play EQ.<br />
<br />
Some people hate the constant stupid politics of raid invites, rules, etc. as well as the politics behind loot distribution. 25-man badges and loot to match them will allow people who want to raid to see content and not focus on the loot.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, though, majority of their efforts. As you can see, 2.4 will also be introducing a new 25-man, which will still keep the raiders one step ahead of the casuals. Blizzard's idea is that likely the raiders will get to see it first, and then after a bajillion nerfs and new badge loot, everyone else will be *more likely* too. Seeing how this impacts the raiding progression % overall up to WotLK release will likely tell Blizzard how to handling raiding progression in WotLK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, because the majority of casual players earn 150 badges in around 2 days ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc0db03a06a4</div><div class="date">2008-02-19, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You do realise that more people done Karazhan , than there ever was people doing Blackwing Lair. Most likely Lurker / Voidreaver been killed by more people, that there ever was BWL raiders.<br />
<br />
Yet BWL still require a annoying attunement, a attunement which require a special key, that even fewer people got today.<br />
So we can assume, that just because it does not drop nice phat lewt epics, it's not worth considering in &quot;nice to see&quot;?<br />
<br />
People are loot whores, even the casual people. Otherwise they would done BWL, before crying about Hyjal/BT attunements.First you should compare to MC (or even UBRS) if you wanted to not compare apple and oranges. Second, of course there are more people raiding... The number of people playing WoW has also greatly increased since that time. Though that increase was probably more in favor of casual players than hardcore raiders.<br />
<br />
BWL attunement being annoying ? Appart from the key (which is now easy to get since the fragments drop 100%), it is (and was) a piece of cake pugged by tons of groups every day. I really don't see how it could be difficult. The attunement is definitely not the problem (in this i agree with you), it's a problem of motivation, nobody want's to go there.<br />
[off topic : how is it different from the SSC/TK/Hyjal/BT requirements ? Those require you to mobilize 5 to 25 capable people for several hours. A bit more than the 30 minute you'd need to clear UBRS with whatever incomplete pug group]<br />
<br />
But then you go to &quot;not doing BWL = being loot whores&quot;...<br />
Of course you try to play the content where most people are. Of course you aim to get better, and to be rewarded. This comes both from discovery and gear, both are motivations. I won't even deny that a good number of people are unhealthily attracted by epix.<br />
But please, stop being an extremist like that... Did you do each and every instance while levelling ? No ? You skipped one ? OMG LOOT WHOER ! Nevermind there could be good reasons, like it's far away, nobody goes there, it's not interresting in terms of background or whatever...<br />
<br />
As an aside note, i did go through Wailing Caverns and ShadowFangKeep at 70 just for the discovery, being alliance, went to MC/BWL some months ago despite having finished them previous to BC (we did a rapid BWL attunement run 30 minutes before going there), but didn't went to AQ40 yet. Man, am I a loot whore or what.<br />
<br />
Edit :<br />
<br />
You will never be able to deny, no matter how much you love raiding, the fact that there are FAR more people who are not in BT/Hyjal than those who are.make that SSC/TK.</div></div><hr />

Most people just don't seem to get the whole &quot;You got it first before everyone else, THATS's the benefit&quot; concept. If i buy a new car for £100,000 and then 6 months later see someone else driving the same car but they only paid £50,000, i don't run over to them and say they don't deserve it. Items depreciate, get used to it. It's the way of the world.<br />
<br />
I can't better my gear. I haven't been able to for over 3 months. Am i bitter that these badge rewards will make some people have comparable gear? No.... the reason why? because when you inspect me or even look at me you can tell where my gear comes from. You can tell what i've accomplished in game. People really need to get over this selfish attitude. To get the 600 odd badges someone will need to get anywhere near me will take the &quot;casual&quot; players Months. In fact it will take them so long that most of them will give up before they even reach halfway.<br />
<br />
The game is changing and Blizzard has clearly adopted a new way of gearing people up. Give the new shiney gear to the hardcore nutters for 6 months to play with and then let everyone else catch up with badge rewards and expansions.

pretty sure i used that exact explanation (altho with usd) several months ago when windcape had like 30 posts on mmo-champ to his name :D<br />
<br />
the same argument is used in pvp, where anyone can save up 5k points and get 3 pieces first day, however 4 weeks later when im 5/5 and have the weapon and some people are still 3/5 the same as the first day it makes a difference. most people however can't appreciate that. <br />

i don't see warriors QQ'ing that people are still getting thunderfury every week just as a keepsake, its the same situation, but having it for 2 years gives you recognition you won't find as if you got it last week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But why that doesn't happen?<br />
<br />
Fact is it is not easy. It is not easy to coordinate people (try to create a new raiding guild from scratch if you doubt it). It is not easy to have the right people online at the same time. Particularly when a large part of the playerbase are a bunch of ignorant misguided characters. <br />
<br />
That is what blocks progress and access. Connecting people (this sounds like a Nokia comercial...).<br />
<br />
In what sense does this connect to the topic?<br />
<br />
PVP requires nothing like this. Instances not much also. So the rading rewards should be - imo - above any other type of reward. But, on the other hand, a certain level of base gear should be available through other means. That might able a player to bypass some content, true, but not a guild by itself.</div></div><hr />

How many people do you think Raid and kill Illidan in S3 gear? If you think getting S3 stuff and actually pvp'ing at a higher bracket 2100+ in a 5v5 requires no communication, co-ordination and skill then you are sadly deluded.<br />

<br />
Other mmorpg's have it that way. EVE with their ships, Everquest with zones, Guildwars with their zones/battles.<br />
Only Blizzard is starting to think 100% with the wallet, and pleasing the majority in terms of basic things as gear balance.<br />
<br />
As people have said, you are entitled to your opinion but here's mine: No, it is not OK. You list other MMO's that have exclusive content, but WoW has a population base bigger than all of them combined.<br />
<br />
More people = more money = more content.<br />
<br />
It's fine to have a few rare and special things that only 1% of the population will see. Nerfing the grind for wintersaber cat rep is dumb in my opinion. The people who did the grind got...a mount with a different skin. Making that rare doesn't stop people from progressing, seeing content, excelling in arenas, etc.<br />
<br />
But raiding is one of the fundamental choices of activities for people in WoW. Locking away most of that content to 1% of the population is a bad decision--both from a game play design and a business perspective.<br />
<br />
And though many have said it, I'll say it again. Blizzard is clearly only letting the loots flow because they are running out of time. The expansion is coming, making all this loot worthless. They don't want the Sunwell to be the next Naxx. (Which is why they are re-releasing Naxx in the expansion.)<br />
<br />
Again, the badge gear isn't even that good anyway. I posted the link to this post in my guild forums and the first response by a lock was &quot;Meh. I guess the caster ring is pretty nice.&quot; We just killed Kael and are working on Vashj. This gear isn't even good enough to excite people in a SSC/TK guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Starting by the end, sure it does. But the support effort required to have a 5v5 is far smaller than a 25 man raid.<br />
<br />
And the question is that the new badge loot &gt; rewards from middle instance raiding. And no, I'm not saying this is necessarily bad, but that Blizz didn't have much other path to go.<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw, I think the PVP gear should not ever set foot on the gameworld. Arena gear/Resilience is destroying any shred of balance. The branching between PVP and PVE is not good for the game. Better to create a special PVP environment for PVP sandboxes (arenas) than to affect the game as it is being affected.<br />
<br />
And tbqh, good pvp game = Guild Wars.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm. How many 5-man dungeons in BC compared to vanilla? How many raid instances? Arenas? Usable professions? Gear sets? Quest types? Quest content? Not to mention more servers with bigger capability. My server use to have horrible queues.<br />

Yeah, reskinning is annoying but hardly an indicator that Blizzard is doing nothing with their increased resources.<br />

More revenue doesn't necessarily translate into more resources put in the game or that the game will improve. TBH Blizzard has been quite lazy at delivering content in the past year, at least compared to LOTRO (that I also play). So many features left not implemented (e.g. guild and player housing). Not by the lack of resources.<br />
<br />
Actually just do a timeline comparison. <br />
<br />
Have nothing against Blizzard making money - this is a business and I don't complain (much ;)) - certainly get my money wirth (otherwise I wouldn't play). But that is a far cryfrom believing that Blizzard is putting their heart and soul (i.e money ^^) into the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
indeed, but i think part of it goes further than just having some team of devs make guild housing possible for 100 man-hrs. this game was released in bits from the very start, many zones were locked or had invis walls (remembering back to closed beta) NPCs were non-existent in a bunch of places. <br />
<br />
blizz has said many times over they never expected the game would have the success it does. and imo they never kept up with the growth in terms of their code, nor did they fix mistakes (all the people from the diablo project that left, shaeffer bros and whoever, solid coders). chances are they kept looking ahead trying to keep up instead of going back to fix mistakes. look at how many bugs exist, and how many new things break each patch. without giving tons of examples, spell reflect is a new ability, but it only reflects damage, it heals the warlock on a deathcoil, it used to freeze the warrior still but reflect damage to the mage. if you use a /sit /spell reflect macro you could guarantee that the reflected spell always crits. all of these mechanics now have to be modified and tested, and all those modifications have to be tested to see if they affect anything else.<br />
<br />
the basic point being, if they could take a year and rewrite the entire game im sure they would in hindsight, and it would be much greater. unfortunately those ignored bugs and errors tend to simply snowball, and i may be off but to me blizz doesn't have a good appreciation of everything in the game in terms of mechanics. too many band-aids and patches of hot-fixes of patches, etc etc...<br />
<br />
that's not to say they don't have the money to hire people and fix it all, but they don't seem to be interested in doing that as long as they can keep it going the way it is right now.</div></div><hr />

*shrug* Going to have to agree to disagree. With the BC release (and up until patch 2.4), I've seen Blizzard actually acknowledge that every decision they made back in vanilla was not perfect and (the horror!) make changes to correct things.<br />
<br />
The Rank 14 honor grind before was moronically painful. Running MC over and over and over again with tons and tons of trash mobs was painful. So many things took so much time for the simple fact that there was nothing else to do. Now there are big raids, small raids, heroic dungeons, arenas, BGs, daily quests, rep grinds, useful professions for which to farm, etc.<br />
<br />
Personally I think people are just nostalgic because WoW was amazingly fun when it came out and it's hard to top that first impression. But BC has brought tons and tons of content and new things to do. If people are burnt out because they've played the same game 60 hours a week for 3+ years that isn't necessarily the fault of the designers or representative of a lack of effort on Blizzard's part. You mentioned reskinned armor and player/guild housing. Those are two features I couldn't honestly care less about. I realize that they are top on your priority list and therefore you feel Blizzard is being lazy by not giving you what you want. But there are some popular things (like instant flight paths) that people cry for and Blizzard (correctly) has not implemented.<br />
<br />
I've tried many games and the only ones I've become addicted to are Starcraft, Diablo II and World of Warcraft. People love to trash Blizzard (and trust me, there are reasons) but in the end they design the games that people flock to and play for hours and hours.<br />
<br />

Funny?? <br />
Not all bosses are tank and spank though. some pose a lot of complcations. but yeah I won't get upset about your post. it is sort of true, raiding something with good gear doesn't require far more skills as a tank than doing a PuG heroic with a messed up team who break traps, dot saps, overaggro wrong mobs, forget to resheep etc. Same goes for DPS with macros-mods-threatmeters etc etc after having tried a boss a few times and read the guides, its really not that hard...<br />
<br />
What is essential really in wow, are two things. Time and organisation. Time to cast all Real life chores aside for 2-3 dedicated raid nights, and organisation enough to keep the progress wheels going in 25man, which can stall or even give a setback to raidprogress.<br />
Its not got much to do with brains except those guilds that are battling closely for world 1st kills, and those people who organise wellfunctioning guilds. You can be lucky to find a shining star healer who has lived his quiet wow life in an ill-organised casual guild and recruit him quickly, and you can be stuck with a moron dps in a BT clearing guild, you can never tell :)</div></div><hr />

Hey, fuckhead… did you read the part where BoJ will drop from all 25 man raid bosses now? No? Then shut the hell up with telling other people to go read. You really need to take a chill pill. The loot from the badge vendor is inferior to everything in BT/MH, with exception of the crossbow for Hunters. The only reason it's so good is because Blizzard's itemization team apparently still believes Marksmanship is the raid spec, so they thought a &quot;fast&quot; 2.80 speed would be &quot;bad.&quot;<br />
<br />
With that exception, the rest of the loot is badly itemized compared to MH/BT items. Not only that, it costs 150 Badges for a weapon. 150. That's 8 weeks of full Karazhan clears for one item. That is not &quot;EZ Mode&quot; or &quot;Casual friendly,&quot; sorry.<br />
<br />
On the official forum, Drysc explicitly stated the new items are not intended for &quot;casuals&quot; or &quot;small-group content.&quot; They cost so many badges specifically because they are for raiders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyhow BoJ rewards are made mostly to aid raiders (there is even fresh blue post about it somewhere), that is why they cost so much badges and that is why 25 mans start dropping those.<br />
<br />
Of course you can get them by doing Heroics but it will be VERY slow. The more you raid, the more/faster BoJ rewards you will get. Plus as said BoJ rewards are made &quot;worse&quot; on purpose. They are still very good but not perfect and worse than &quot;perfect&quot; loot from &quot;real&quot; raids.<br />
<br />
I seriously do not understand people bitching about BoJ rewards. I would understand if they would help in PvP but they are mostly not helping or it is same way as raid gear - glass cannon mode. If people get that gear and have it easier in heroics or faster progress in raids it is only good for everyone.<br />
<br />
People should look at their raid and ask themselfs: will this help my raid/guild/alt? Answer is YES. So be happy god damn it!</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has been a great games designer. Don't misunderstand me about it. I would not rate their TBC effort to be anything up to Blizzard past history - just remember the complete mess that the initial TBC release was in terms of cardinal game issues such as itemization (T4 lol) and class balance (super Droooods). <br />
<br />
Also, the issues I mentioned were just popular examples (I really couldn't care less about the armour design, although it is very sloppy). But that is not the issue - question is that more resources doesn't necessarily translate into a better game.<br />
<br />
Another thing is simply that Blizzard as a MMO developer has one of the worst relation with their costumers I've seen. Maybe because the popularity of the game, perhaps due to the player base mentality. Truthfully is not easy for a dev to manage the biased and short minded mentality of a playerbase made of classes. But many things that Blizz devs say are simply second rate excuses - or simple lies. <br />
<br />
That said, I don't say that some changes - many changes actually - in TBC were not for the best. Even including the new badge gear - something I actually support as a gear path (once posted about it). Question is that the game, as a whole, is not comparatively better - and it could be - because it can't encompass the dynamic nature of PVP and the static nature of PVE (gearwise) at the same time.</div></div><hr />

So everything after this post is pretty meaningless, isn't it Windcape?<br />
<br />
Seriously... you talk about an MMO being able to support that 1% of the player base that will see high end raiding content, right? You realize that without the other 99% of the gaming 'retards' out there that WoW wouldn't have the funds to put together that 1% of the content, right?<br />
<br />
I like the many paths to be able to see more of the content for casual gamers like myself. I mean, I pay the same amount of money that even that 1% does... so shouldn't I have access to almost as much of the content? If that means I have to farm Kara for badges to give me that leg up because I'm not as good a gamer as some, so that I get to see some of the fine content that Blizzard has put together for the majority of the player base... I say kudos to them!<br />
<br />
WoW has never been a difficult game btw. That is why it is attractive to as many folks as it is. Its a chat room with an item database attached to it. Those that are constantly epeening about how they are elite and all... heh... too funny. Blizzard designs its systems to insure one thing only... that they retain their entire player base for as long as possible. So it's no suprise that they add in a badge grind as an option to progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
your elitism is astounding. like 6-8 weeks ago weren't you complaining about chain wiping on the nerfed versions of vashj/kael?<br />

now you break through that roadblock, maybe with archimonde or illidan down since that time, maybe (confirm your progression imo)...and you talk down to every other person who wishes to see content :-\<br />

It's rather pointless to demand easier access to something you will never be able to do anyway, unless you change something fundamental,<br />

I don't enjoy boss nerfs, very few encounters are challenging enough allready. Removing more and more of the challenge in the game, because<br />

again iirc you haven't had a chance to enjoy them because 2.4 will bring the first set of boss nerfs you may actually experience. wiping in karazhan is terrible, but he never said that is what he is stuck on. and tbh 4/5 and 5/9 is not hard for the average raiding guild with half a brain. you act like pve is a race with only 1 winner, and the other runners should never even get a chance to cross the finish line. some guilds are slower than others for many, many reasons and that is no reason to deny them the chance at it. again refer to naxx pre-tbc. blizzard wants the maximum amount of people to see the content, within reason, not spending countless man-hours developing encounters for the 1-2 guilds per server that spend the 40 hours a week to conquer them.<br />
<br />
also, going back to the race scenario which seems to quite nicely fit your pov - if that were the case you would be in his position QQ'ing about content while nihilum or DnT or vis maior clear everything first within minutes of each other. don't let tanking in some already farmed and fading content go to your head. if it does feel free to keep it off the forums, imo they are not intended for that purpose &gt;:(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramble</div><div class="date">2008-02-20, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Again... as you have cancelled your account... does it really matter to you?<br />
<br />
And the challenges will still be out there for you, so why does it matter if others are able to reach that content through gear acquired in a manner different than the way that you progressed?<br />
<br />
Example: There are those that excell at PvP, and especially the DPS classes/spec can walk into a lot of the higher end PvE content and fit in quite well. Same can happen for those that want to mess about in PvP and have high-end raiding gear to play with. So why is it so abhorrent for those that can grind out badge-gear as they're path of progression to be able to fit in and have fun in higher end PvP or PvE content? Because they haven't earned it by doing it the way you have?<br />
<br />
As to the difficulty? It's more difficult find 24 other people that have the same schedule you do and the same gear progression you do than it is to defeat that actual content... especially when the strategies are being spoon fed to you by the guilds at the frontlines of progression doing all of the hard work.<br />
<br />
Bottom line... since you obviously won't need to grind Kara for badges (since you will be doing all the crazy-difficult content further up the food-chain) then what does it matter to you if others will be taking this path?</div></div><hr />

NO. dps have to full on socket +hit and even then they are left short having more stam/resil and not enough crit and spell dmg / attack power. <br />
<br />
you say its no effort and i agree to lose 10 games at 1500. and again you get hung up on that. people getting 313 points a week get 3 pieces over a period of 4 months. buying points is of course an exception, and reason for personal rating on more gear. that is something that needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
telling people to l2p or get a new guild is talking down to them...and yes you did gruul before shatter nerf, didn't know you took a break tho, point being if you have people messing up on your raids as you say that problem was alleviated somewhat by the t5 content nerfs.<br />
<br />
i could care less if you buy s3 gear with badges or tokens. but you don't have to. just put those 10 res gems in your t5/t6 gear and you will be fine for arenas, or at the very least viable. clearly we differ greatly on this topic, but its not like those s3 people are littering your raids so who cares if blizz gives them a chance? they are nerfing content you dont even do anymore...that is definitely elitism :-\</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pig</div><div class="date">2008-02-20, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Getting some of the best gear in the game, without putting any special effort into it.... fair to some, not to me.<br />
<br />
What complete and utter sensationalist crap.<br />
<br />
I have full S3.. how did i get it? By having full T6. I really couldn't care less if someone loses 10 games at 1500 a week, for 4 months, to get 3 items of kit.<br />
<br />
Why don't i care? Because i've had the benefit of having the Gear before them. This point is crucial and its one that's just whitewashed over time after time. In fact its been said so many times and in so many examples i give up trying to explain it. Why can't people understand that as time go on and content gets older, Blizzard will make it easier for people that haven't experienced it, to be able to experience it. In 18-24 months time we'll be having this exact same conversation, as Blizzard start to make the Northend content easier for those that haven't yet experienced it. Will i be complaining? No.... Why?... because i'll have finished that content 6 months before the other 98% of the 9 MILLION people that play this game. Will my achievements be any less worthy than those that can't put as much time into the game as me?..... No.<br />
<br />
People really need to understand this point.... As time goes on and as content gets older, Blizzard will make it easier for the masses to experience it. Thats the policy that they have adopted. Accept it or go and do a Windscape, cancel your account.</div></div><hr />

Fourth graders don't need rewards for tying their shoes unless they're retarded.<br />
<br />
I think that this is the thing that galls many endgamers. We've got a better raid than most of the people on our server. We've got great players, we've got great leadership and we made a commitment to being very good at what we do. We spent a lot of time practicing it. We spent golds upon golds and hours of our lives getting better at it, and every time we surmount a challenge Blizzard comes along lowers the bar for the next folks. Yes its elitist, and part of the great thing about being an elitist is that it doesn't bother me in the slightest that I am one.<br />
<br />
People are going to say that I'm just QQing and that it WILL be a challenge to get all the badges, and it won't happen overnight, and after all, we've worked hard in KZ and we deserve some credit too. To them I say this: Karazhan and the heroics are to engame content what getting off your butt and going to the kitchen for a coke is to the Boston Marathon. No comparison. The gear rewards from the &quot;heading to the fridge&quot; raids should reflect the comparative level of difficulty, nuff said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't even progressed nicely myself. I've screwed up, staying to long with a guild that just didn't have the skill, then changing server only to find out that I missed my old server. I'm now in a guild that has the skill but is having a recruitment crisis. Therefore I haven't even killed Vashj yet, but I understand why - it's my own fault. Not only did I do the above mistakes, I also changed main from priest to tank, and currently changing back again.<br />
<br />
My guild has cleared ZA, but the people still prefer to go Karazhan on non-25-man evenings. Why? Because Karazhan is easy mode and gives more badges! Judging from the badge loot upgrades they will be doing this for months to come - meaning that we've spent more than a year farming Karazhan!? What's the point in that? Where's the challenge? <br />
<br />
I shall probably buy a few of these excellent items, but I'll do it as a bitter man. Cause I didn't earn them. How can a nice gear-upgrade mean anything if everyone gets it anyway?<br />
<br />
Oh, and my personal oppinion is that Blizzard is aiming more to please the tekkenwankers (arena-dudes with no respect for the original concept of WoW) then to please the real WoW-player. This is another result of that, if you ask me. Sad-sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ZA sucks. The first three boss have 0 interest, 4th is fun, 5 is ok, final boss is just boring. <br />
<br />
And Karazhan looks really good, ZA is terrible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This argument is so bloody rotten. Hear it over and over: &quot;If you disagree with the changes, just play another game&quot;. But the thing is, it's people like the ones saying this very sentence that is ruining the beatifull game that WoW once was. Those people are the ones that should go play other games, not the ones that started playing wow for what it originally was.<br />
<br />
If you cant accept that dedication is rewarded, play another game. If you can't accept that you shouldn't get the very best gear if you only want to play Arena, go play Tekken. WoW was originally about rewarding the ones that put in the effort and it's sad that it had to be changed so that tekkenplayers and others not suited for the original setup would keep paying money to play it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get rewarded by raiding.... how has that changed? Your post stinks of someone thats crying because they get owned by people in PVP gear. Get over it, Raiders can't PVP in their PVE gear anymore.</div></div><hr />

All of your so-called achievements are within a GAME, which changes drastically with every patch. What do you expect for your accomplishments? A monument to commemorate the great boss kill no. 2345 on server no. 456? If you want something more concrete to show for your &quot;effort&quot; and &quot;time&quot; do something more worthwhile with your life than simply be great at a game. You'd have better luck at bitching about the achievement system on xbox live, a token proving accomplishment is no different than a piece of gear fitting into a slot. You should at least be able see how the two are the same. <br />
<br />
By your logic, every expansion in an MMO is a complete waste of your previous play time? Then why bother playing the game if that's how you feel? If your goal is to be the best at raiding, then accept that as being only a temporary thing, as with every patch and expansion, guess what, your accomplishments are eroded. You had over three years to get this point.<br />
<br />
As far as the premier guilds clearing this stuff while it's still on PTR, do you think their achievements are any more permanent. If they are lucky maybe someone there will get a dev job at some next mmo like it happened with EQ and WoW. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry that you feel that your efforts are now wasted, but maybe you should reevaluate what you are spending your time at succeeding if this bothers you so much.</div></div><hr />

No one but Blizzard (if that) can tell. But my guess is it won't be in March. Think April.</div></div><hr />
