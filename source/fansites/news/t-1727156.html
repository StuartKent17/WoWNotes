PvP<br />
How large will the 6.1 Ashran teams be? (40v40?etc) If too big, everyone going for one event will DESTROY fps due to server lag.<br />
yup something we'll keep an eye on (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568246654081454081))<br />
<br />
Wargame Battlegrounds currently can only be entered with EXP-ON. Can we address this bug?<br />
we'll investigate it. We have to ensure that nothing in wargames grants you XP. Need to be thorough. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568548974149238784))<br />
And to clarify, wargame arenas with XP-off is fine. It's just the wargame bgs that bug.<br />
thanks for the information (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/568551718041964544))<br />

<br />
I dunno Blizzard is trying the no-fun approach with the game. I just got no idea what the hell are they doing to try and keep subs in wow, why can't they wait till the next patch update everything they have fiddled with between patches has either made it worse or no one can't be bothered playing at all. Do they want people to play there game but it seems to me they are either catering to the forum crowd or to the elites who are up there in raiding so they have no chance in catching up to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Horde players could ask saurfang to come on patrol with them (like any other follower) and he would cleave the shit out of whatever force was invading your garrison. He did more damage than any other follower you could recruit.</div></div><hr />

Visiting Garrison profession traders are now on a rotation and is no longer random.<br />

That they didn't do this from the get go just shows how lacking blizzard is in their ability to design something so that it works without being fixed 50 times first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know if other guilds done it before,but even if they did,that doesnt make it honorable.Final boss will not ask them anything about it,because blizzard has method's back ( dont deny it,if it was anybody else that account-shared,they would be banned for 2 days for exploiting,but when method did it blizzard looker the other way)<br />
<br />
Of course its obvious why they account shared.They realised they had the wrong roster,and that Paragon would win for a second time in a row,which would be a death blow.So they grew desparate.However,winning by cheating hurts a repution much more than losing a fair race.<br />
