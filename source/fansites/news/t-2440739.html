BlizzCon Floor Map<br />
That's a big building. How many people can it accommodate?<br />
A lot. The Anaheim Convention Center is one of the biggest in the world I think. <br />
<br />
25,000-27,000 based on past blizzcon and other events in the anaheim convention center<br />
It can definitely hold more than that. Last year we said we had what 35k? <br />
<br />
Also we're only like 18 days away. I feel like if BlizzCon was a class it would definitely be a rogue, cause it sure does feel like it sneaks up on you. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769727461?page=1#4))<br />

Still waiting on that amazing Giraffe mount that was pitched many years ago.<br />
And that otter mount? I'd kill a thousand gnomes and I would kill them with a smile on my face if it meant having that mount as a reward at the end!<br />

You'll just need to get Exalted with a new faction, the Otter-man Empire.</div></div><hr />

Its an actual joke at this point.<br />
Changes on the PTR for Death Knights in regards to PVP is not yet complete. More changes for Unholy and Frost are on the way and we hope to share those with you guys soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
One of those incoming changes for example is that we're reducing the runic power cost for Death Strike in 8.1 and increasing its healing for Unholy and Frost.<br />
<br />
lol Unholy DK needs more than a deadly strike buff. How are you supposed to use it if the enemy's too far? and BTW that doesn't fix the squishy pet, the multibutton issue and the awful diseases system. <br />
<br />
Epidemic must replace death coil, Festering Wound has to be a DOT and plague strike doesn't have to be dependant of it. And would be great if death coil &amp; death strike be combined into one attack (eg: pest coil) <br />
<br />
PS: Still waiting for Bli$$ard to ban premades on random BGs and limit &amp; match the ammount of healers per faction</div></div><hr />

Too bad it was impossible for Blizzard to come up with anything for Alliance other than horses. Such a shame that it was completely and utterly unavoidable.</div></div><hr />
