Just seems like times that a lot of people would be online and playing.. and then when the servers come back up.. a lot of people slamming the servers to get back on. Never stops to amaze me how common sense is so disregarded.. and for what.. so the server guys could sleep in and get in some IHOP before getting to the office at a casual 10am? GG</div></div><hr />

The rolling restarts were to fix an issue with players hacking the game, I doubt they were thinking about what issue might happen with log in servers. I'd rather have to wait an hour to log in than spend all day being insta killed in Orgrimmar.</div></div><hr />

So you'd rather be able to play a game that a couple of hackers are having the time of their lives in, then wait for a stable one that has the hacks fixed?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2012-10-07, 06:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks like some people found a way to get a hold of &quot;test&quot; items again -- as opposed to an outright server hack. And by 'test' items, I mean the various items that devs use to hard-test encounters and whatnot that can kill a target on use, or kill things in an area.<br />
<br />
There were reports of a player getting their account banned back in WotLK when someone got a hold of one of these items to one-shot Flame Leviathan.<br />
<br />
The video in the Joystiq article also demonstrates the use of an XYZ hack program do distort the vertical location of your character to simulate &quot;flying&quot;. Such hack programs were prolific in the days of level 58 DK bots floating underground to mine in Wintergrasp.<br />
<br />
point I'm getting at is: the servers did not get 'hacked'. The hacking is done on the client-end. Simply code vulnerabilities in the game itself instead of the hardware.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkguyver2020</div><div class="date">2012-10-07, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You people are far too dependent on this game in order to function.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, his post can be read both ways, and having it saying &quot;un install&quot; does not make sense in his statement. I'm sorry I read it the other way, but I guess it's because nowadays there are usually trolls bashing WoW whenever there is something to complain about.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2012-10-07, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But uh, on topic of people not being able to in? <br />
<br />
On one hand, find me a game or website that's never had an instance of unexpected game inaccessibility and I will be stunned. Even Google had problems 12 years ago.<br />
<br />
The other hand, auth server downtime had perfect timing. I was going to go take a nap anyways.<br />
<br />
And also let this be a lesson to you: if the servers are just restarting, log out of your character and then just go to Realm selection. You won't have to log back in, and you'll see the moment your server comes back up AND the added bonus of not being one of hundreds of thousands to hammer the login servers to cause these little spontaneous screwups to happen in the first place!<br />
<br />
That's what I did anyways, but I had shut down my client to put in a new addon, then saw the newspost. <br />
<br />
Anyways, naptime. I suggest most of you go take one as well.</div></div><hr />

One, login issues has happen last week, so it has nothing to do with the hackers or slowing down said hackers. Seems like every moment they do restarts on the servers, it tend to cause login issues. Two, you can still login the game if persistent enough. If you have patience, just wait around 10-15 min while it's saying connecting and you should be able to jump back into the game (however, it's the only known way of getting in; it won't work for everyone). Three, the hackers are real. There have been a couple of reports on US and EU forums stating so. I'm not sure how they'll fix it, but it shouldn't be too hard if hackers can do that. However, if they are on your realm, your best bet is to stay out of major cities (both Alliance &amp; Horde) for a while.</div></div><hr />

It has already been discussed in the thread. Someone was instakilling entire cities and they needed to squash it.</div></div><hr />

Maybe a little rage, but the term messing up a wet dream comes to mind, when doing a SIMPLE restart!</div></div><hr />

Well, that's been discussed in threads but it's never been confirmed that it's why the server restarts happened. The login issues will be fixed... life on earth will continue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I forgot to mention that. It works for some people, but it won't work for all. Another idea is temporarily turn off the firewall you're using and then do that.</div></div><hr />

i think he meant re installing because he was not able to log on, not because he was coming back to wow</div></div><hr />

You do realise you didn't get those if the servers were down for couple of hours..? Those haven't been handed out since TBC because the server downtime hasn't been the same as in Vanilla or TBC. For example weekly maintance doesn't end up 18 hour maintenance almost every week. At least I can't remember overly long maintenances since TBC (excluding patch-days) in Europe.</div></div><hr />
