Achievement - The Rat Pack<br />
The Rat Pack (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11431-the-rat-pack) has proven challenging to figure out, but Tzhaa (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/935642-Tzhaa) and other group members have done it!<br />
<br />
<br />
There are several rats that spawn between between Curator and Shade of Medivh<br />
These rats are lootable and will give you a Rodent of Usual Size (http://www.wowdb.com/items/143664-rodent-of-usual-size)<br />
Once you have mounted the rat, you can defeat the Mana Devourer and will earn the achievement!<br />

They specifically said they MADE people switch on toons with good legendaries. Are you not comprehending the actual message transmitted? It was just a polite way of saying it (like politicians do) but it was: &quot;good legendaries or get the fuck out of my raid&quot;.</div></div><hr />

So Method benched characters with bad legendaries in favor of characters with good legendaries. When the initially bad legendary characters got good ones, they were taken back into the team. You were saying?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually method did not bench ANYONE from having bad legendaries. They continued to have that person raid, if the person (who had bad legendaries) suddenly got a good legendary on their alt rather then main, then they would have them come in on their alt instead of their main. If they did not have an alt with a good legendary they were still not sat.<br />

They DID bench MAINS only if ALTS have better legendaries. Their MAINS were getting legendaries from the other sources, not raids, because they were playing on their ALTS(with better legendaries) while raiding.<br />
<br />
So it's still kinda stupid.</div></div><hr />

You are not being benched if you are playing an alt. You are being benched if another person is playing in your spot. They clearly stated that they did not bench players over legendaries, only asked a player who had multiple characters to use the one with better legendaries, if they had one with good legendaries.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it actually enhances how important it is to have a legendary.<br />
the main got better gear, more artifact traits, the player prolly know how to play his main better than his alt, and he invested more time into his main.<br />
but the alt pulled a OP item out of its ass, so it is used for the raid.</div></div><hr />

Got any actual examples yet, where the actual deciding factor was &lt;a&gt; had good legendarys, &lt;b&gt; didn't?<br />
<br />
Not like it matters though, since this hypothetical tripe of a discussion has been in the game for as long as there was good gear or powerful perks available outside of raids. Leatherworking mandatory for raiding Sunwell!</div></div><hr />

I honestly don't care who's what because love = love. Hence, even as a heterosexual, I'm super cool with them potraying Tracer as a lesbian/bi. Why not? It might inspire other gamers to be who they are and potentially come out. :) <br />

Also, people in WoW are only getting benched for subpar legendaries in baddie hardcore guilds, not actual hardcore guilds where the maximum throughput is based more so on overall player skill rather than overloading what it takes to get the boss down.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doesn't seem to be coming out with any form of clarification, which I think is the right way to go about it.<br />
<br />
Tracer has a girlfriend, that's it. People can draw their own inferences from there; frankly, media could use a bit more representation for bisexuals (For all the progress made of late with LGBTQ representation, there's not a lot of the Q in there).<br />

What in the ever loving hell is a &quot;credible lesbian?&quot; Serious question, have you ever actually MET someone who's LGBTQ?<br />
<br />
The only defining characteristic of a &quot;credible lesbian&quot; should be that she is sexually attracted to women (And that's not even the be-all-end-all as said woman could also be bisexual).</div></div><hr />

Yes, I have a bunch of lesbian friends, one which discovered herself way after I befriended her, and I have 2 relatives that are lesbians, and there is social constraints on their behavior, that aren't present on Tracer.<br />
It's not because you never took the time to notice that the sexual behavior, being from the gender that attract the attention, up to the amount of the sexual drive affect everyday behavior, that this thing doesn't exist. <br />
It's not the special snowflake of mommy ability to notice that defines how people work or not.<br />

So you're basing your conclusion here on an entirely anecdotal &quot;evidence&quot; supplied by a sample size of three people?<br />
<br />
New flash, kid, LGBTQ folk, just like literally everyone else in the world, are not defined in their personalities by their sexual orientation. You know what makes Tracer a credible lesbian? The fact that she's apparently attracted to women. That is literally the one and only necessary characteristic and for you to argue otherwise is objectively and laughably wrong.<br />
<br />
I am genuinely curious, though, what exact &quot;social constraints&quot; does a gay woman, as a rule, have that you or I do not?</div></div><hr />

I mean, relatives and friends or even self aside, you can't really speak entirely for a group of people like that.<br />
<br />
I'm an American who hangs out pretty exclusively in my own little liberal echo chamber and based on that, I might claim that most Americans fall under a set field of mannerisms, but to do so would be naive and ill-informed.<br />
<br />
The idea that Tracer isn't a &quot;credible&quot; lesbian is ludicrous in the sense that there's no categorical criteria for determining a lesbian beyond the point blank qualifier of &quot;is it a woman who is sexually attracted to other women and is not sexually attracted to men?&quot;<br />

I would absolutely accept the argument that she's not definitively a lesbian because, as far as I know, the second aspect of that question is unanswered. At the least, though, Tracer has checked off the one and only box required for being classified as either lesbian or bisexual.</div></div><hr />

You are being benched if another person is playing in your spot. They clearly stated that they did not bench players over legendaries, only asked a player who had multiple characters to use the one with better legendaries, if they had one with good legendaries.<br />
<br />
Just accept that it's still benching. Trading a better geared character for a worse one that just got an OP legendary clearly shows the problem here. Stop trying to deny that.<br />
<br />
Guilds like that have a smaller rooster, just because these guys went the effort to put up alts geared enough to be brought into their world 1st race progression shows how much the legendary system failed. Remember that this xpac is a bad one for alts and the normal guilds won't have that luxury of every player in the raid having a decent geared alt fishing for OP legendaries together with the main character.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a character in your account with decent legendaries, you'll get benched ASAP for someone who has it. The message was clear when he adds the &quot;but we have had...&quot;. If those guys didn't have an OP legendary in one of their raid capable alts, they would be benched eventually. The guild didn't have to do it because of that.</div></div><hr />

This is a bad example of your point because top guilds do split runs and have multiple geared alts. They have always focused on bringing in the top players in to their raids, not necesarrily the class that they play, and in the past have even asked their players to reroll to a different class if a particular class was needed for a particular strat or stacking. Is that so different than benching the main for the alt?</div></div><hr />

The guild always (for a few exps now) had alts they could bring to progression (alts are for split runs not legendaries) - because of split runs and expansion start the difference between a main and an alt is at most 1 week of gameplay (small enough that 1 leg will make the alt better). AP is just grind grind grind.<br />
<br />
Even in a guild like mine (oscillated 20-10 world), back when I still played I had 1 alt that was clearing HC raids shortly after the main (when HC was highest difficulty). Plus a plethora of other alts that could PuG normal/early heroic. Up to a point it's natural as you have plenty of time when you play 40 hours a week.<br />
<br />
It wasn't said anywhere that someone that was unlucky on all chars (5-6 characters at about the same gear level, was it) was benched, it's something you are saying, because you want it to be true. Not something that will happen just because you think it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fiestatastic</div><div class="date">2016-12-24, 01:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That question asked to Method is invalid, since all of those players put in the time and effort to make their own individual judgement based on the rng bestowed upon them. Many of them wrote comments previously about switching mains of their own accord due to rng they received on alts. That's personal benching, they decided on their own to bench their main based solely on legendary rng. Less hardcore guilds, where players aren't putting in time on several different characters, without any doubt are going to sit players with the bottom line numbers being rng gear based.</div></div><hr />

That being said, they now have to make McCree gay. (The Japanese guys would fit the role more, but LGBTQI would dub it fanservice for young female body-positive yaoi fans, which it definitely would be)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buu</div><div class="date">2016-12-31, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you're basing your conclusion here on an entirely anecdotal &quot;evidence&quot; supplied by a sample size of three people?<br />
<br />
New flash, kid, LGBTQ folk, just like literally everyone else in the world, are not defined in their personalities by their sexual orientation. You know what makes Tracer a credible lesbian? The fact that she's apparently attracted to women. That is literally the one and only necessary characteristic and for you to argue otherwise is objectively and laughably wrong.<br />
<br />
I am genuinely curious, though, what exact &quot;social constraints&quot; does a gay woman, as a rule, have that you or I do not?<br />
<br />
Yes, I am. Why? Are them not good enough for you because their lives and behavior don't fit your thoughts? SHOW ME the proof that those are the only three exceptions on the world to your views. You assume that my sample is faulty and your is the perfect representation of reality.<br />
Yeah... You're pretty lame in arguing.<br />
<br />
And yt's not &quot;OF GAYS&quot;. It's social constraints of EVERYONE. You will never see a heterossexual man that likes hunting talking about beauty products. They will talk about guns and cars.<br />
EVERYONE have social constraints.</div></div><hr />
