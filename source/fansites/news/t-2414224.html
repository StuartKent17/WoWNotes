Daughter of the Sea song<br />
So Blizz, where can we download the song in the Warbringers: Jaina short? That music was really f-cking good and I want it on my phone so I can listen to it on repeat. Any plans to put it available on iTunes? Spotify? Amazon? etc?<br />
<br />
Currently at this time it's not downloadable. I'll pass on that you guys were asking for it though and ask. I know it wasn't mentioned on this thread but I've seen it asked in a lot of places and wanted to point out that is actually Laura Bailey singing as Jaina Proudmoore and Donal Kearney sings the male lead. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1096437-daughter-of-the-sea-song/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20766016910?page=1#8))<br />

MDI All-Stars Team Selection Update<br />
The MDI All-Stars event at BlizzCon promises to be one of the most exciting moments in our extended rollout of Battle for Azeroth. To ensure the competitive integrity of the event, the WoW Esports team is disqualifying Gulch Trotters from the MDI All-Stars event.<br />
<br />
Two members of Gulch Trotters, the fourth-place finishers in the MDI competition, are no longer eligible to participate in WoW Esports events due to suspension for Terms of Use violations. Going into MDI All-Stars, teams are allowed a single substitution to keep the spirit of fair play. Because the team won’t have the required number of eligible players, Gulch Trotters will be replaced by Free Marsy at the MDI All-Stars exhibition.<br />
<br />
More information on the Mythic Dungeon Invitational All-Stars event, including schedule and format, will be released soon.<br />

<br />
Have they said anything about guild master controls yet with the 8.0 changes, specifically with regards to giving out permissions? Right now it's horrible with the new &quot;Is Officer&quot; rank that grants eight permissions with a single checkmark box. Prior to patch 8.0 each of those eight permissions had their own checkmark box and it was MUCH better regarding the customization of controls and ranks. Right now it's a hot mess as a result of the patch, and it's upset a lot of guild masters.</div></div><hr />

not to mention that quest being gated behind weekly schedule, so tell me again why should we add game time 1 month before launch instead of 7 day before launch<br />
since when that a patch day was no longer new content release day but 1 month before content release day</div></div><hr />

<br />
Continuity: You, the player, are the reason why he is captured during the Wanted quest. This leads to Hogger being a prisoner in the Stockades and one of the bosses of the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

Ah, I thought we took his head in the quest though? Or am I remembering that wrong?<br />

<br />
Edit: it was a “Huge Gnoll Claw” although we were told to show proof of his demise back before the revamp<br />
<br />
When it comes to MMO questing, unless a revamp to push the story forward is made, everything is stopped in time: Hogger is still at large, Vanessa VanCleef still leads the reborn Defias, etc. (I know, they made a revamp in Cata, yet Hogger is still around... I guess they're selective)<br />
<br />
In other words, there's no point in worrying about continuity because Blizzard's not going to change anything just for that.</div></div><hr />

It's far too much. In fact, mobs in places like Stratholme and Blackrock Depths have far more health than those in Burning Crusade or Wrath dungeons - and we're talking two to three times as much, not just a little bit.</div></div><hr />

People have been saying that since Wrath dropped. And they are still waiting. And 10 years from now...if it really bothers you that much...you'll still be waiting yourself. Move on with your life, bro...seriously. If it bothers you that much....move on.</div></div><hr />

We lost a week of mythic raiding due to the problems in there. Oh well, I guess it's to be expected with any major Blizzard patch.<br />
<br />
Have they said anything about guild master controls yet with the 8.0 changes, specifically with regards to giving out permissions? Right now it's horrible with the new &quot;Is Officer&quot; rank that grants eight permissions with a single checkmark box. Prior to patch 8.0 each of those eight permissions had their own checkmark box and it was MUCH better regarding the customization of controls and ranks. Right now it's a hot mess as a result of the patch, and it's upset a lot of guild masters.<br />
<br />
ISnt that possible by using the: /guildroster command ingame?</div></div><hr />

Animus is easy as cake. The only one that is a real problem is Ra-den.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I agree. Used to do him no problems but now if you don't use a lust he can be a tight dps check because of him casting the bolt that insta Gibs you.</div></div><hr />

This, along with making the Pterrordax way too small after taming really puts a crimp in the enjoyment hunters have with new tames.</div></div><hr />
