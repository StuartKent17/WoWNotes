Dragon Soul Difficulty Changes<br />
Don't forget that the previously mentioned Dragon Soul changes are supposed to be going live next week, so this will likely be your last chance to complete the encounter before everyone has access to the 5% buff.<br />
<br />
During the scheduled server maintenance on the week of January 31, the Dragon Soul raid will become enveloped by the “Power of the Aspects” spell, reducing the health and damage dealt of all enemies in the raid by 5%. This spell will grow progressively stronger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/109257/power-of-the-aspects/) over time to reduce the difficulty and make the encounters more accessible. The spell will affect both normal and Heroic difficulties, but it will not affect the Looking for Raid difficulty.<br />
<br />
The spell can also be disabled by talking to Lord Afrasastrasz at the beginning of Dragon Soul, if a raid wishes to attempt the encounters without the aid of the Dragon Aspects.<br />
<br />
For those of you who raided in Firelands and/or Icecrown you’re no doubt aware that as time goes on we want to keep people progressing by adjusting the difficulty. For any number of reasons a group may be having difficulty on a specific encounter each week, and our intent in adjusting the content is to ensure the ability to keep progressing, enjoying the content, and gearing up. With Icecrown we progressively buffed the players, and while this slow progression (and ability to opt-out of the buff) were both beneficial, it led to an expectation of your characters power, and once you left the raid you could certainly feel less effective. For Firelands we attempted to fix that by nerfing the content instead of buffing players, but we nerfed the content difficulty all at one time, which was counterproductive for players who really didn’t need as severe a change as we made. With Dragon Soul we’re attempting to do the best of both by having a progressive nerf to the content, keeping player power constant while providing small increases in assistance over a long period of time, as well as allowing players to opt-out of the assistance by speaking to Lord Afrasastrasz.<br />
<br />
We hope you continue to enjoy Dragon Soul, and that these changes encourage you to attempt a higher difficulty, or just keep pushing to down that next boss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria PvP<br />
One of our upcoming goals in Mists of Pandaria is to make the gap between the overall DPS/healing of both PvE and PvP items smaller. In fact, we have design plans for new PvP combat mechanics that will make PvP gear and weapons markedly better in PvP than equivalent level PvE gear and weapons.<br />
<br />
The overall goal is to reduce the barrier for crossing between PvE and PvP (and vice versa), as well as to also ensure that PvP gear is the best in PvP, and PvE gear is the best in PvE. More details on these upcoming changes will be posted as they become available.<br />
<br />
Regardless of anyone’s rankings past or present, the process of learning and striving to improve never stops: it helps even the most battle-hardened gladiator remain able to go toe-to-toe with their fiercest opponents.<br />
<br />
In team-based combat such as Arenas, pressuring an enemy in order to go for a kill or striving to protect your comrade from being the brunt of a focused assault are part of the experience, no matter what classes are driving to get the job done. Most matches are an incredibly complicated dance between combatants: a push and pull of offensive and defensive tactics, of coordinating switches, interrupts, dispels, crowd control, and of learning when to use your particular cooldowns or abilities, and when to change your tactics on the fly. Depending on who you ask, what class they are, what brackets they are in, and what team compositions they run, you are likely to get a totally different answer as to what particular class gives them the most trouble at any given time.<br />
<br />
As far as the current balance of various classes: it’s something we are, as always, keeping a close watch on. We welcome you to post constructively about your observations in the appropriate threads, and the more focused and on-topic you can keep it, the better.<br />
<br />
While it's not possible to address every individual thread or concern of the community, rest assured we are listening, regardless if you see us post within a particular thread or not.<br />

They're already giving baseline resilience. I know personally I love blowing up noobs who have no gear. Its part of the learning curve. If you don't ha e that what the hell are the new guys striving for? To be only SLIGHTLY better? Cmon now. Blizzard is removing everything that takes a bit of work and rewards you with a feeling of accomplishment. They already gave every class a mortal strike and a self heal. What the hell are they doing. They're going to end up with o e big lame bg with everyone hitting like they're weilding nerf bats.If you hit everyone for 20k, that's alright. But when you hit that one guy for 50k, that's awesome. This is BS. Stop trying to reinvent the bicycle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ideas are ideas, what does it matter where they come from as long as they're good and/or they work?<br />
<br />
The only possible way such an idea (blatant rip?) could go south for Blizzard is if they name it the exact same thing -- Expertise. But I really doubt that will happen, as I think it would leave more than a few players scratching their heads for a bit (for obvious reasons, I hope), and that's, generally, not Blizzard's MO.<br />
<br />
As for Bioware's implementation, Expertise is no different than Resilience, except in that it buffs damage done to other players in addition to the reduction in damage received from other players. Its effects seem kind of contradictory when you read them out loud (&quot;so, it increases the damage I do to another player, but if they have an equal amount of Expertise, my damage is reduced by the same amount that it was just increased? o.O And I just went through that whole gear grind for a stat that, at the end, results in a zero sum for everyone involved? /boggle&quot;), but, hey, it is what it is. I guess the same could be said about Resilience too, now that I think about it... heh<br />
<br />
Don't misunderstand though; I may think systems like Expertise and Resilience are taking the easy road on design, but they are -- in a game that's so gear-centric (unlike Guild Wars) -- the easiest ways to possibly control balance in PvP without affecting PvE. <br />
Especially if you throw the two stats into one game: if &quot;Expertise&quot; only affects output, and Resilience is a base+ stat that only affects input... you can tweak the values of &quot;Expertise&quot; on a class's gear if they're doing too much/too little damage in PvP (or Resilience if there are survivability concerns), and since that gear is practically required for PvP and worthless in PvE (meaning everyone will be wearing it)... Bam. There's that easy nob that you can turn to tweak PvP balance.<br />
<br />
It's actually kind of smart... (finally? lol)</div></div><hr />

Somewhere in a dark corner of Ancient Poland sits the skeleton of what once was a great inventor, eternally-complaining, wondering what anyone ever saw in that simple-minded circular wheel. Pfft... kids toys...<br />
<br />
Especially when he knew his Cubed Wheel (Cubic Wheel? Wheel Squared? Marketing was not his forte.) would have revolutionized the world!!<br />
( &lt;--- see Avatar for extra emotion, lol)<br />

My, it would have been so revolutionary, the trade industry alone would have come to a screeching halt overnight!!<br />

But yeah, it's just the way the art world works (and games are a form of art). One artist sees what another has done, likes it, and incorporates bits (or even the whole thing, sometimes) into his next piece, and then the process continues with another artist (or maybe it doesn't).</div></div><hr />

Is it just me or is that statement completely contradictory, how can they make the gap smaller but make both sets of gear optimal for their own area. Imo they need to make remove the ilevel from pvp gear and just call it the name of the season. That way we get less scrubs in pvp gear with no gems or enchants using the high ilevel to get into heroics and raid finder. The other way round maybe doing rated bgs or arena should require a resilance level or amount of pvp gear.</div></div><hr />

Now if any class would get out of control the developers could just fiddle a bit with their &quot;expertise&quot;.

Omg that is genius. Blizzard could just make a stat like mastery, but it only works or enemy players. Buff /nerf the specs stat t balance.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deftones</div><div class="date">2012-01-28, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Or... they could flag items as 'PVE only' the same way as tokens that drop from Raid Finder/Heroics. Anything specifically flagged as 'PVE' are not useable in BG/Arena. Hell, you wouldn't even be able to queue for them with them equipped, &quot;you must remove xxxxx/non-PVP items before doing that&quot;....and once inside a bg/arena, not be able to re-equip them: &quot;You can't use that here&quot;. It's pretty much weapons &amp; trinkets that are ruining it, so that would be the only things flagged really. Come on in with your 403 zero resil armor. You'll still have weak 378 dungeon weaps.</div></div><hr />

That does not make much sense to me. You will still end up with pve end gear people raping in pvp then.<br />
<br />
Tbh they should really separate pvp and pve. Your PVP ilevel does not get you in raidfinder untill you get some amount of PVE craftables; your PVE ilevel does not make you que to certain bg's. Untill you get some PVP craftables.<br />

It's hideous to see PVP geared people do 13k dps in whatever PVE environment, or see PVE geared players get smacked in PVP.<br />

<br />
Although you forget that at lvl 60 the PvP gear did a pretty good job of raping in PvE too, it worked both ways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This stat would obviously only be used on PvP items to keep PvE items out of the PvP scene, imo.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murlfireface</div><div class="date">2012-01-28, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard always over complicate things. PVE gear should have no place AT ALL in PVP. If they want to make concessions, then they need to make it 2-way and let PVP gear be viable for raiding. I dont care how many times someone dies while gearing up, its part of the process and it gives you experience learning how to use your character.<br />
<br />
Because dying instantly helps you play your class? I'm assuming that statement was aimed at PvPers, which I have some problem with that argument. Dying instantly doesn't let you play your class better. You may be able to (at best) see what happened to you that made you die so quickly, but in the long haul that doesn't help a whole lot with your skill as a PvPer...most things you need to learn (like CC, interrupting, target priority, knowing how to avoid/get out of bad situations) can't really be done without some buddies and the nearly mandatory resilience you need to survive hits. The game is still team oriented, despite any 1v1 overpowered situations. I do agree that PvE gear should not have a place in PvP at all, but you can't 100% exclude someone because they don't happen to have resilience. You start pvping with pve gear regardless, so I can see the reason to have a base amount of resilience so you don't get smashed nearly as hard and actually have time to react and try to get more real practice using your abilities and learning from the situations you are thrown into in PvP. <br />
<br />
If that statement was aimed at PvE, sorry for the rant, but there's still a point where that gear will barrier you from progressing in raid content sadly. There's only so much you can learn from experiencing/learning mechanics in PvE that it does just becomes a question of your personal skill playing your class and the gear that improves your ability to do so.<br />
<br />
Regarding the question of making PvP gear viable for raiding...they're not making any concessions for PvE (the base amount of resilience is hardly going to break the game) and those in full PvP gear can still do ok and earn PvE gear more easily with the model blizzard is trying to set forth (heck they can do decent right now, but again is not a preferred model for someone who aims to be a PvE player). In the end, we won't know how well this new system and mechanics they have yet to announce will work until we get our hands on it in beta and can give feedback on exactly how good a fit this may be for this age-old issue of crossing PvE and PvP...So, until that time I will reserve any furthur judgement on the system other than that I have high hopes it'll all work out. People need to stop jumping to conclusions and wait to see how it all goes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At lvl 60, pvp gear was exactly a pve gear with &quot;easier access&quot;. No resilience. At lvl 70, same thing.<br />
<br />
Except that getting pve gear was ways and ways harder than just grab a few easy points in arena for powerfull epic pve gear labeled &quot;arena gear&quot; (remember weapons considered &quot;must have&quot; for melees and other things like that?). When they started including resilience, things started to even out. Easy, but crap gear for pve (no LFD, Raid finder, etc helped). Then they decided to start including &quot;pve stats&quot; on pvp gear (was mostly crit rating + resilience before) like tons of hit, expertise, haste... then pvp gear started to become good pve gear again in wotlk.<br />
<br />
With the many stats/mechanic changes from tbc to wotlk and to cataclysm (like removing def, increasing intelect benefits, etc.) and with the way they were designing pvp gear now, they got some serious problems (like out of control healing in pvp) and again ppl using pvp gear to do the same job as a pve geared player (bad players have bad performance, no matter their kind of gear, you can have ppl doing insane healing, dps or even tanking in pvp gear, actually most tanks in LFD for instance are season 10 geared).<br />
<br />
When I see ppl advocating the end of pve gear in pvp, altough I understand it, I don't get how exactly they think it would work out. I mean, we don't get pvp gear while leveling for example. So basically, you would get to 85 and had to queue to BGs/Tol barad naked... decreasing even more the team's performance on it and bothering everyone else way more. Saying that you get to 85 and just &quot;buy the gear from AH&quot; is kinda of unfair since a pve player can get to 85 with decent gear to start his dungeons and never spend a gold on gear if he wants while still reaching the gear for decent raiding. And on top of all that, these same ppl think that the other way shouldn't happen (removing pvp gear from pve), wich should happen even now (making it worth 0 or 1 ilvl for LFD/LFR to reduce even more the chances of failing like Blizzard now wants).<br />
<br />
Will never get why ppl think it's unfair pve gear in pvp, while pvp gear in pve isn't. Since we're discussing &quot;pvp-only&quot; players against &quot;pve-only&quot; (since Blizzard always stated that players who do both pve and pvp should always get a edge over pve-only or pvp-only players by having the best gear from both worlds), it's unfair that someone can just afk-honor grinding (even without AFKing is easy), choose with piece they will buy and then get inside a dungeon or raid and, if not perfoming ok, will still get carried by others most of the time and roll on the drop at the end. While a full pve player will, most of the time, get rapped in a BG or RBG or arena (unless he happens to be a OP class/spec with a OP piece of pve gear, like the current trinket+rogue combo that get a entire team to protect him) and leave it without nothing except the honor points, but probably will get tired of being destroyed before he gets enough resilience to trade his entire pve gear.<br />
<br />
If a pvp geared player had to pass the entire process in pve like a pve players needs in pvp (changing most of it's gear to &quot;see the entire content&quot;), then it would be called even. But until it happens...<br />
<br />
This is kinda what Blizzard wants to address with their announcement of resilience baked into our toons. Not that it is a good decision, but it's a atempt to fix that problem. Wich also means they don't plan on removing pve gear from pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, that wouldn't change the fact that PvE items can be used in the PvP scene with great benefits. Something that people tend to dislike. <br />
<br />
Using PvE gear in pvp in the case i described would pretty much be useless, since without the &quot;expertise&quot; stat you have nothing to negate the increased effects of resilience and PvE gear would in this case make you do less dmg in PvP compared to if you were decked out in PvP gear.<br />
<br />
What i propose:<br />
<br />
Buff resilience (&quot;capping&quot; resilience puts you in the 60-70% dmg reduction area)<br />
<br />
Add a stat that increases damage done by you against other players. Using full PvP gear would counter the increased power of resilience, making it just as powerful as it is today with a total damage reducation of around 40%<br />
<br />
If a class is OP in PvP but not PvE, use this stat to balance the class, preferably by tweaking the stats on that class' set pieces to not affect other classes.<br />
<br />
If a class is OP in PvE but not PvP, do the changes needed, then tweak the stat on PvP items in order for the class to stay as they were.</div></div><hr />

What are you, 12 years old?<br />
<br />
WoW has been riding on the shoulders of other MMO giants -- Everquest, Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies to name a few -- and have borrowed many fundamental ideas, from simple concepts to complex systems, from these games.<br />

Blues have even gone on record, on the forums, saying that Blizzard does not innovate, they mainly put polish on others' ideas.</div></div><hr />

You're hanging a bit too literally on his words. Blizzard has stated that a HUGE number of the mechanics / aspects of the game were copied/borrowed/evolved from earlier MMO titles, several of which the founding members of wow's dev team loved and enjoyed (sidenote: those people aren't working wow anymore). His main point is that anyone claiming that SWTOR is &quot;stealing&quot; from wow is ignoring that wow &quot;stole&quot; from every other past mmo. Had wow not existed, swtor could have easily existed. There is not a SINGLE specific aspect of the game that you could directly tie to being influenced by wow. You could easily substitute EQ, DAoC, Ultima Online in on any number of elements swtor uses. And I'm ignoring the more niche or less remembered titles which each had some pretty interesting elements themselves such as Asheron's Call and Shadowbane.</div></div><hr />

We all start to argue about who stole game ideas from who. I shall tell you something what te f does it matter if the product is great i dont mind if they took something out of other games. The wheel has already been invented so dont try to reinvent it try to improve it. Point is all games take something from other games its not stealing its just you are not going to reinvent something that already works great.</div></div><hr />

They're already giving baseline resilience. I know personally I love blowing up noobs who have no gear. Its part of the learning curve. If you don't ha e that what the hell are the new guys striving for? To be only SLIGHTLY better? Cmon now. Blizzard is removing everything that takes a bit of work and rewards you with a feeling of accomplishment. They already gave every class a mortal strike and a self heal. What the hell are they doing. They're going to end up with o e big lame bg with everyone hitting like they're weilding nerf bats.If you hit everyone for 20k, that's alright. But when you hit that one guy for 50k, that's awesome. This is BS. Stop trying to reinvent the bicycle.<br />

PvP should NEVER be about gear just skill. So your argument is dumb.</div></div><hr />
