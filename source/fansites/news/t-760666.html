When King Greymane severed ties with the Alliance after the Second War, the kingdom of Gilneas became independent from all other nations and opposing forces. Although the massive Greymane Wall protected Gilneas from outside threats, a virulent worgen curse and civil war crippled the kingdom from within. As the Cataclysm strikes and the Greymane Wall's gates are destroyed, the people of Gilneas must come to terms with their dark curse and learn to persevere through catastrophic earthquakes and an unrelenting Forsaken invasion. The Horde recognizes this land as a strategic location with key resources to fuel the faction's war effort against the Alliance, and Horde forces will not stop their siege until the city and its surrounding territories are under their control. To protect its lands from the Horde, the once-isolated nation of Gilneas must now work with the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Controlling Resources<br />
The Battle for Gilneas is a new 10 vs. 10 Battleground for level-85 players. Much like they do in Arathi Basin, teams must control strategic capture points on the map to accumulate resources. The first team to gather 2000 resources wins.<br />
<br />
The Battle<br />
Teams will start at opposite ends of the map with default graveyards nearby. Once the match begins, teams will race toward each other to vie for control of three strategic points; each point will allow your team to gain resources and additional graveyards. Adding to the intensity of the battle are many obstacles that block line of sight, as well as chokepoints for fending off enemy advances.<br />
<br />
The Overlook<br />
In the center of the map is an area known as the Overlook. Hills on either side of the map create chokepoints, while narrow paths through the hills provide teams with alternate routes. A river dividing the map will also lead opponents toward a single bridge. In some cases, dominating the Overlook might be the key to controlling the capture points.<br />
<br />
Capture Points<br />
In The Battle for Gilneas, three distinct resource points are available for the taking by either the Horde or the Alliance: the Mines, the Lighthouse, and the Waterworks. Once any of these points is held by a team, access to nearby graveyards will be granted. In addition, workers from the controlling faction will show up to collect the resources necessary to win the battle.<br />
<br />
Chaos will be unleashed upon Azeroth when Deathwing returns, but many steadfast leaders will see the Cataclysm as an opportunity to further the cause of their people... or simply attain more power. The situation in Gilneas is no different. Will the embattled Gilneans be able to defend their land after realigning with the Alliance? Or will the Forsaken, reinforced by Garrosh's Horde, seize this near-forgotten territory as a new stronghold in the Eastern Kingdoms?<br />

Have to agree with some of the other posters, first look at the map seems heavily Alliance biased as far as key points go.</div></div><hr />

It looks like kind of a recycling of Isle of Conquest textures, doesn't it? Except with more emphasis on Arathi Basin mechanics rather than take the keep. <br />

It's ok. Dissapointed that it's not an actual city battle however.</div></div><hr />

Well the distance from each spawn point to the waterworks looks about the same if the horde take the path by the mine. And for some reason it just looks like its more difficult to defend the points as alliance</div></div><hr />

<br />
^ this<br />
<br />
It really irritates me that a totally cursory look at the map reveals an enormous Alliance bias. 2 of the contested graveyards are extremely close to the Alliance spawn point, as well as 2 of the resource nodes. That means in an even battle, Alliance will always win because their numbers are replenishing faster. Imagine a 5v5 at Waterworks. 2 players on each faction die and res at the same time. The 2 horde players have to travel more than twice the distance to return to the battle, which means for 15, 20, maybe even 30 seconds, it's 5v3. The alliance will win these battles every time, and therefore, they will win every time.<br />
<br />
Cursory. The fact that they'd even put that map out there in its current state is embarassing.</div></div><hr />

Why don't they fix the BG queue times for existing BGs instead of adding even more bgs? Honestly, there's not much point in releasing something for which the queue is going to take 30min or more.<br />
<br />
How do you propose that they &quot;fix&quot; population imbalance or general apathy towards PvP?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swizzle</div><div class="date">2010-09-16, 07:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see here...the map actually favors horde in terms of strategy. For one, taking mine is a LOT harder than taking either of the two other since there is only one way up to it, perfect for tunneling people. Second, trying to defend 2 bases with only 10 people will get taxing, especially if the other side knows how to play (aka, sending a wave to one base luring defense away form another base). Third, Horde have the height advantage which in any battle is important. Fourth, Alliance just suck at PvP and will probably try to capture the lighthouse because it looks pretty, just sayin'.</div></div><hr />

It's hilarious though that you have people complaining about some sort of map bias on a map they haven't even played yet. Makes it pretty hard to take complaints about other maps seriously.</div></div><hr />

Well if you want to be pedantic about it, not a great deal. It is PvP after all, and it doesn't vary a lot from that. If you mean style of pvp like capture the flag, tertiary wars, then not a lot but ... its pvp. How would you make a battleground any different?</div></div><hr />

it features heavily in the Silverpine questing storyline, no doubt worth it for anyone interested in the worgen and/or forsaken to smash through some low-level content to experience the full Silverpine questline, it's very epic, especially towards the end and when battling your way into the Gilneas frontlines.

<br />
It really irritates me that a totally cursory look at the map reveals an enormous Alliance bias. 2 of the contested graveyards are extremely close to the Alliance spawn point, as well as 2 of the resource nodes. That means in an even battle, Alliance will always win because their numbers are replenishing faster. Imagine a 5v5 at Waterworks. 2 players on each faction die and res at the same time. The 2 horde players have to travel more than twice the distance to return to the battle, which means for 15, 20, maybe even 30 seconds, it's 5v3. The alliance will win these battles every time, and therefore, they will win every time.<br />
<br />
Cursory. The fact that they'd even put that map out there in its current state is embarassing.<br />
<br />
You have no idea where the actual capture point is, so your outrage is basically a product of your own ignorant assumptions. If the capture point is further east toward the river, then it's equidistant, and no advantage to the alliance.<br />
<br />
The only thing that's embarrassing is you flaming over some thing you really don't understand yet.</div></div><hr />

AB isnt sym. its slight favor the horde. The 3 Base Point (lumbermile+mid+ the one at horde spawn) is easier to defend (shorter way to every flag when you wait at the point where the roads meet) then Mine/Mid/Ally spawn. When consider this knowledge, mine is also harder to defend cause u can jump down to mine, but not up to lumbermile. And the horde is faster at mid flag when game starts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is it really that hard to come up with something orignal why not just have two hills and let us have a 40v40 battle royale with a last man standing wins it for the group</div></div><hr />

Holding flags to collect resources while seeing faction helpers gathering is such a great idea! Cool thing is that you get to spawn closer to the flag if you control it making for some heated battles. Blizzard is really amazing, and this is exactly what the game needed, something new and fresh. This along with the other new cool game of capture the flag in TP is something that's needed as well. I want to know what Blizzard feeds those guys at their developer building so I can come up with awesome totally new ideas too. :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nythiz</div><div class="date">2010-09-17, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gotta love how people bash this as AB v2 and then trash it. AB is a great BG (imo the best); no need to reinvent the wheel when you can make it a variation like this.<br />
<br />
Also I hope they get around to making new types of BGs with different objectives (King of the Hill / Deathmatch style play / Objective like SotA only without actually sucking). The problem is that i think there's a lot of things that you can not balance in those games.<br />
Take a king of the hill type game, it would heavily favor classes with knockbacks. Take a deathmatch style play, the team with less healers almost insta-lose. The urban warfare was a nice idea, but it heavily favors some classes (LOL LOS).<br />
<br />
I think people would be surprised how much effort goes into designing stuff like battlegrounds. Making mirror maps is really boring, balancing non mirror maps is really hard. Also I'm pretty sure blizzard didn't randomly put down the graveyards and capture points in this new BG; so I doubt horde has a huge disadvantage, there is probably some factors on the map you can't see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can only say: awesome, I love playing AB.<br />
<br />
And no, no sarcasm. Seriously do you people complain like that too when an fps comes out with several maps on which you can do deathmatch ?</div></div><hr />

Although 'Urban Warfare' is getting a bit overused in this thread I would like to try out a battleground with a bit more cover and objects to go LoS with.</div></div><hr />

You know in EotS, you have to go to the right in the start to not lose health. It might be something similiar for alliance in this BG, and then Horde might be able to catch up for Waterworks. <br />
I think Blizzard knows it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wsg = twin peaks<br />
ab = battle of glineas<br />
Av = IoC<br />
Eots = ab /wsg<br />
<br />
Sota... well, kinda original i must admit<br />
<br />
One of the purposes of PvP is to kill the other faction, no BG can change that. What you want different? are there any objectives, lets say f.e. in CounteStrike, besides rescue hostages or disable bombs?<br />
<br />
And my view about vehicles on PvP: i love them cuz i hate rogues, and vehicles cant be stunlocked. See where the most whiners about vehicles come... honorless rogues</div></div><hr />

Some BGs will be slightly uneven, for me that adds flavor and a challenge, my only wish is that who getting which side would be random -kinda- like SotA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem is they just don't care. They're not pressured to try and come up with novel new concepts because the hive eats up anything they put out. They could come out and say, &quot;we're charging you $30/mo now, oh, and Cata, has half the content promised as the other half is all DLC&quot;, and people would still say &quot;OMG BLizzard is AMAZING, I love you!&quot;.<br />
<br />
But yes, either they are tapped out on ideas, or they just don't really care to work on new things due to the lap dogs.</div></div><hr />

It's because of all their tears.</div></div><hr />

WG is the only BG that doesn't have graveyards you can capture. When I get tired of capturing graveyards in battlegrounds I always turn to Warsong Gulch. There should be another alternative for me to turn to.</div></div><hr />
