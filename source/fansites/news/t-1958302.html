http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/thumb/newBuildBanner.jpg?v2 (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/newBuildBanner.jpg) <br />
<br />
In the upcoming Patch 6.2.4, we're moving to a new Battle.net infrastructure. There are changes to many of the Battle.net-related Lua APIs, including Battle.net friends and Battle.net chat. If you maintain an AddOn that makes use of those features, you may want to log in to the PTR and test that your AddOn still functions correctly. To help AddOn authors troubleshoot potential compatibility issues, we’ve highlighted a few of the big changes to help direct you to areas that may need your attention.<br />
<br />
Conversations<br />
Support for conversations has been removed. This includes all C-functions (BNCreateConversation, BNGetConversationInfo, etc.) as well as all Lua/XML references to conversations.<br />
<br />
Toons<br />
The new Battle.net architecture doesn’t have the concept of “Toons”. Instead, we refer to “GameAccounts”. As a result, many functions with “Toon” in the name now refer to “GameAccount”<br />
Examples:<br />
BNGetToonInfo -&gt; BNGetGameAccountInfo<br />
BNGetFriendToonInfo -&gt; BNGetFriendGameAccountInfo<br />
BNGetNumFriendToons -&gt; BNGetNumFriendGameAccounts<br />
<br />
Presence IDs<br />
Previously, “Presence IDs” could refer to either Battle.net accounts or individual toons. Most functions were able to accept either type of presence ID and, when passed the wrong type, tried to guess at what you were trying to do.<br />
<br />
Presence IDs have been replaced with bnetIDAccount and bnetIDGameAccount. With this change, we’ve made all functions strict about whether they accept Account IDs or Game Account IDs. In order to make this easier, all Lua variables have been updated to specify which type of ID they are.<br />
<br />
You can translate from a bnetIDGameAccount to a bnetIDAccount as follows:<br />
bnetIDAccount = select(17, BNGetGameAccountInfo(bnetIDGameAccount));<br />
You can find a player’s active bnetIDGameAccount from a bnetIDAccount as follows:<br />
bnetIDGameAccount = select(6, BNGetFriendInfoByID(bnetIDAccount));<br />
<br />
Current Realm Name<br />
The “realmName” CVar no longer exists. You can get the name of the current realm using GetRealmName().<br />
<br />
Do you mean GetRealmName(), the already-existing function? Or is this a new function that can (or must?) replace GetRealmName()?<br />
The &quot;realmName&quot; CVar is no longer there, but the function to get the name of the current realm is still GetRealmName. Correction made to the post, thanks for asking.</div></div><hr />

all these are just tests to see what numbers come out. They will do it again and again in all sorts of directions with all sorts of adjustments, most of the time jsut to see what the performance output to contrast and compare. stop behaving like its the final product<br />

Which makes sense, they're based on and base themselves on &quot;ideals&quot; of shallow beauty and base desire. To that same effect the succubus wear a painfully tight corset to pull off what you're talking about, to create that sort of allure and attend to their masochism at the same time.</div></div><hr />

I think that's a thing from the Chinese version of the game-- I can't cite it, but I remember reading about something like that somewhere.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, the early prerelase builds of WoW had a &quot;tired&quot; status where you earned 50% less XP; you only earned full XP if you were &quot;rested.&quot; People hated it, so Blizzard halved XP gains and changed &quot;rested&quot; to give double XP instead. This was taken better.</div></div><hr />

Most likely just the English localization for a new string for the Chinese region. Chinese law mandates that online games discourage underage players from playing for an excessive amount of time.</div></div><hr />

The legs are horrible. The legs below the knee are larger than the thigh. The ankle bracelet is too big and there is no muscle definition in the legs.</div></div><hr />

But that is his old model, isn't it? Perhaps they're tweaking with it or something? I don't really see any changes, but... Maybe it's the wrong picture or maybe they've done some small edits. Not quite sure why, though.</div></div><hr />
