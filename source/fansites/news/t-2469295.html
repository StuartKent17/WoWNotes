<br />
With all the drama Blizzcon caused this year all the other panels got so forgotten and unappreciated at the show like the art and animation panels which I found very insightful and inspiring as a former wannabe animator graduate. :)<br />
<br />
When it comes to their level design and art styles in their game, Blizzard always do a good job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This statement is exactly the problem with entitled the players of WoW. <br />
<br />
As someone who has worked as a game designer/developer as well as a programmer I can assure you that the art team can not simple shift to the team that balances classes as easily as you can switch from flipping burgers to making fries at your job.<br />
<br />
Now leave the art team the F%&amp;K alone!<br />

Don't get your hopes up ;) It is an art stream afterall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When are they going to fix the new nelf models to finally make them look decent and as enhancements of the original model, not that abomination it is now<br />
See <br />

<br />
Why do nelves have worgen casting animations, like the rezz animation? It makes me die inside everytime I see it. If I wanted to play a dog I would have chosen worgen as a race, but I didn't. Why do they copy paste animations between races? It kinda destroys the feel of the racial identity for me.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this. Still I hate patting yourself on the back when the game is sinking.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but i can't agree with you... their art is behind... looms like 10 years old... compare with other games that brings almost photorealistic graphics and art... blizzard art isnt good nowadays.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW never aspired to be photorealistic, it is hugely stylised. And even on engine so obsolete they can whip out things like The Necropolis. You may not personally like the art style of WoW, but it is not bad in any way.</div></div><hr />

This is not Q&amp;A. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

I mean if they don't make ads for the games they don't make profit. You know Blizzard had to get another CEO/CFO soon so somehow they have to get those $15m checks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Photorealistic graphics tend to age pretty terribly. The stylized art style can last quite a bit and still look decent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's the obsession with photorealism? It's not supposed to look real, it's supposed to look like Warcraft. Even their more realistic art (the cinematics) are very stylized.</div></div><hr />
