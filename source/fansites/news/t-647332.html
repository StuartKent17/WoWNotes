Tricks of the Trade: To prevent exploits, this ability can no longer be cast on non-player targets. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Val'anyr Proc<br />
If it helps to explain it, the blessing is triggered by healing being done. If you cast a heal on a fully-healed target, you are doing no healing. The bubble itself is triggered by a heal spell being cast. The proc then looks for how much your spell would heal and makes a bubble of 15% of that number. The amount actually healed by the spell isn't a factor for purposes of the bubble. That is why we tried to explain that hots that tick but don't heal cannot cause the blessing on you (the healer) but can contribute to the bubble on the target.<br />
<br />
If the bubble goes down (because it took enough damage or 8 sec have elapsed), then you next heal will cause another bubble for as long as the blessing lasts (which is 15 sec). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137530621-explain-valanyr-please.html))<br />
<br />
Blizzcon Stream<br />
The entire Direct TV broadcast will be available for purchase and the internet stream will be available to those who are not Direct TV customers as well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/25/16904262574-direct-tv-internet-stream-question.html))<br />
<br />
Blizzcon Goodies Bag<br />
I'm not saying we might not preview the goody bag at some point, but for now, we're not talking about what's in it. We'll save that for a later point in time. I don't have any information on specific time for the sales to begin. But we did want to make sure to allow for as many people as possible to be able to get to the site and try to purchase any available tickets.

This is the biggest reason I didn't pay much attention to last years event, apart from the Diablo 3 announcement.(I'm not even into Diablo series) If you are from EU or any other continent but US, you have no way of watching the event but pictures/bad quality youtube vids, here and on other pages.</div></div><hr />

Looks like this can be easily exploited... the MT can strip naked before the boss pull and put on all his gear, this will create a huge HP gap which the healer can heal to create a huge bubble right before the pull ...</div></div><hr />

That sounds more like a creative use of game mechanics to me, giving the MT an extra boost in survivability as the raid and healers get into positions for the fight right after the pull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes.. cuz there is so many bosses that kill you in first 5 s.. <br />
<br />
get real , even if you build up 6k bubble ( healing for 40k hp, and getting bubble on each heal ) , its close to zero in todays healing patterns .. and i wonder how many times will you get that 6k bubble that will absorb first hit, till whole raid will send you to hell for being major annoyance <br />
<br />
you could go wanking all day yelling how op it is, we all known this bubble wont be raid decider, or some op bs <br />
<br />
as to another guy claiming that he wont be able to watch stream in europe, cuz someone said they couldnt watch stream last year , wow what a genius, did you even read both post, first by blue saying it will be able as internet stream for everyone ,<br />
instead of quoting someone you didnt even bother reading in first place.. gj, smart</div></div><hr />

<br />

I think you need to read the clarification on how the mace works again. It doesn't matter how much HP you heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it needs to heal SOMETHING for the proc to begin the effect of creating shields. After the proc goes off, THEN heals, regardless of overhealing, create shields.<br />
<br />
He's right. A tank could take a piece of stam gear off, then put it back on, and have the healer continually heal him back to full with every re-equip, until the shield procs, and then smack down the most huge-ass shield possible before the pull.</div></div><hr />

I was trying to say strip naked and than put everything gear back on again to create a HP gap, but you guys get what I am trying to say. Tank can repeat this until they get the maxed out 20k shield before a pull, intended? Clever use of game mechanics? Exploit? You tell me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theres no exploit in lowering your hp / removing a buff then reapplying it, lol. Thats just like saying that warriors exploit if they use a skill to gain rage and do battle shout before you actually start attacking the boss...</div></div><hr />

Blessing of Wisdom and Greater Blessing of Wisdom: Now grant 92 mana per 5 seconds to prevent being overwritten by Mana Spring Totem. <br />
This explains the &quot;huge&quot; buff, so ok ill take back my huge nerf thread on wow-forums then!.. But ye, I actually thought it was for something like this since after the change of shamans water spring totem the pala buff didn't always seem to stack.<br />

PS3 costs around 220$ now...<br />
<br />
<br />
125$ consist of:<br />
<br />
- A free entry into the Meth &amp; You seminar held by the Blizzard Dev. Team<br />
- Many free things that you somehow loose 10 minutes later<br />
- An in-game pet that will make every retard of the realm you play on whisper you &quot;OMG WER U GOD DIS????&quot;<br />
- complimentary Blood Elf/Night Elf hooker (depending on your faction!)<br />
<br />

Sacrifice (Voidwalker) redesigned: Sacrifices a portion of the Voidwalker's health, giving its master a shield that will absorb X damage for 30 seconds. While the shield holds, spell casting will not be interrupted by damage. 1-minute cooldown. <br />

The shield will be too weak to be of any real use and interrupts from damage isn't a factor in the game anyway.The current void shield isn't helping locks much so why would the new one do it? You can still only use it once every 30 secs and unless it's going to absorb a lot more damage than the current one it's usefulness will be limited. Besides, you will also give up the utility of the other pets by using it instead.<br />

Blizz keeps throwing gimmick abilities to the blue marshmallow in hopes of people using it in pvp but that's not going to happen until they give it some real usefulness like the other demons have.</div></div><hr />

Are you retarded? That's how all shields in WoW have worked since vanilla, including hte current sacrifice incarnation.<br />

It just means no pushback on &quot;absorb&quot; hits.<br />

Tank can repeat this until they get the maxed out 20k shield before a pull, intended? Clever use of game mechanics? Exploit? You tell me.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how much HP gap there is. The tank could be 1 HP off maximum and you could still stack a 20k shield on him. You could proc the blessing healing up people after Prayer of Fortitude buffs and then stack a 20k shield on the tank.<br />
<br />
Read the clarification again. The shield is not based on how much HP you heal.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, it seems so. :( In my opinion, a pet is a raid member and a speciality of the class. since you can spec your pet for tanking, why not using it as a tank. is tanking pet for farming only? seriously, feighn death and you never need a &quot;special&quot; tank pet while farming. <br />
IF you are able to summon a tank pet, you have to be able to use it as a tank pet. this includes TotT.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard dosent like the idea of pet tanking, since they want us to bring the player not the class thing. I think it is fine and players always find a solution for those &quot;impossible&quot; fights blizzard give us, at least till they nerf it and a new strat need to be implemented.</div></div><hr />
