PvP<br />
<br />
Flag carriers in rated Battlegrounds now take 25% more damage from all magical and physical attacks. The 25% additional damage from carrying the flag stacks with the Focus and Brutal Assault debuffs. Flag carriers in normal Battlegrounds are not affected by this change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quest &amp; Creatures<br />
Tol Barad Peninsula<br />
<br />
The quest &quot;Walk A Mile In Their Shoes&quot; has not always been correctly awarding players with quest credit after completing the escort event. This quest is being temporarily disabled and removed from the achievement criteria for Just Another Day in Tol Barad. This fix will require a realm restart to take effect.<br />

Changes to Ambassador Title in 4.1<br />
If you have the achievement you'll keep the title. The Exalted worked differently because we wanted to move the title to a different achievement altogether (50 exalted).<br />
<br />
In this case, if you have the achievement you'll keep the title. If you're close to getting the achievement, you might want to hurry and get it before 4.1 because after 4.1 you'd need to also gain the additional rep to meet the requirements, earn the achievement, and get the title.<br />
<br />
Same as it was for Loremaster or Explorer, if you had the achievement you still have the achievement, even though the requirements changed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161377/changes-to-ambassador-title))<br />

Zul'aman and Zul'gurub<br />
There's a lot of new content in Cataclysm. There's also a plethora of updated content to advance the story.<br />
<br />
Likewise, there's plenty of new content still to come in this expansion. But, we're also going to keep moving existing themes forward when the story calls for it. There were specific reasons for originally entering Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman, but those reasons by no means wrap up the story of the ancient troll empire. These city ruins still serve a major purpose in troll lore, beyond just providing new locations to gain loot.<br />
<br />
We're moving the story of the troll nations forward, and hope you recognize and enjoy that. Hakkar and Zul'jin are gone now. Even so, that doesn't make Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman irrelevant as key locations of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
[...] Zul'Aman is in Ghostlands, which is in Azeroth, not Outland. It's true Ghostlands didn't receive any terrain changes after the Cataclysm, but that doesn't mean the remaining Amani are unaffected by what's happened.<br />
<br />
We'll have more information to share on the return of Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub soon. But for now I'll say this: there is a center of troll civilization yet to be seen in World of Warcraft. There was once an ancient empire of troll tribes united. Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub becoming key points of interest in Cataclysm plays into this. Perhaps something has happened to once again call for the unity of the disaffected tribes. Perhaps a certain tribe with allegiances elsewhere sees this as a very bad thing. ;) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/161314/stop-complaining-about-za-and-zg))<br />

Archaeology items cooldowns<br />
Sometimes it can be difficult to find a good &quot;sweet spot&quot; when choosing cooldowns for groups of similar items such as those obtained through Archaeology. We don't want all the cooldowns to be exactly the same, but we also don't want it to feel like the numbers were chosen totally at random. We may not always get the values right initially, so knowing what feels good to you and what doesn't -- and why-- is really helpful. <br />
<br />
[...] As noted, we didn't want every single Archaeology item to have the same cooldown. Some of the items are pretty unique and provide interesting on-use abilities, so it made sense to us to vary things up a little. This is perhaps a bit different than our approach to other cosmetic or novelty item cooldowns, but Archaeology itself is new and has its own reward structure.

Triple spec instead of dual spec?<br />
An oldie but a goodie! :D<br />
<br />
The question used to be, why don't we have a way to keep a spec for PvE and PvP? And to a lesser extent, wouldn't it be great if I could swap roles with my hybrid if needed without having to hearth and make everyone wait on me?<br />
<br />
Those are the specific reasons for why we agreed with the sentiment of those questions, and dual spec now exists in the game. It's great (kind of) that some people have found uses for it outside of that, having two slightly variant builds of the same spec for different situations, however, it's not our intent with multiple specs to encourage that type of gameplay, and thus it's not our intent to offer tri or quad or quint, etc. specs.<br />
<br />
Obviously having an array of possible specs to choose from would be convenient for any number of reasons, but it would also encourage situations where people are using it to shift their builds around for each individual encounter or task. Those are the kinds of options that quickly stop being options, and instead become a requirement. And as they become a requirement our necessity to design and balance around it changes it from a nice convenience option to a core piece of the game design puzzle.<br />
<br />
A lot of people like to throw the phrase 'slippery slope' at us when we make certain changes, and dual spec is actually truthfully one of those systems. Once we have two specs, why not three? If three, why not four? But, we have our hiking boots on, and don't intend to lose footing on this just yet. BUT sliding down muddy hills is a lot of fun, so you never know.

Recent restoration changes<br />
We're a bit worried about Resto being too powerful in PvP. We wanted to try out the Lifebloom changes to see if it fixed the problem. We don’t think it's quite the right change though, so we're going to revert the Lifebloom mana nerf, but keep the reduced bloom effect. We'll have to keep watching this.<br />
<br />
The change to Efflorescence becoming a smart heal was actually originally just a bug. Since so many of you responded so favorably to it though, we're actually going to redesign Efflorescence to work similarly. We expect the redesign to help the talent be more useful in 5 and 10 player content as well. We'll have more details at a later time.

Word of Glory cooldown in 4.1<br />
The assessment that Word of Glory is meant for more occasional use is rather close to the mark. That's also part of the reason that we're comfortable with employing a cooldown solution in this case. We think that it’s more interesting for Word of Glory to be a reasonably powerful heal that's used infrequently, than if it were a weaker heal used more often. We also like the way Word of Glory interacts with Vengeance because then the heal scales with the content. If you’re taking a lot of damage, the heal is more potent than it would be otherwise.<br />
<br />
We also didn’t really think that healing was necessarily a problem for Protection paladins. We just weren't happy with the style of gameplay it was causing players to adopt. We had tanks telling us “I just miss using actual attacks, like Shield of the Righteous. Every time I use SotR it feels like I'm playing wrong.” While technically a tank had a choice between threat and survival, we felt it was an illusion of choice because tanks often (and rightfully) worry about survival first and foremost. You still have the choice between generating threat and healing, but since the healing will be lower overall, the trade off should matter less.<br />
<br />
The self-healing ability of other tanks has been brought up in this context. When comparing tanks, we look at the whole package, not individual abilities or talents. Deathknights, for example, are designed with less innate damage mitigation than Protection paladins, but they have a lot of self-healing to compensate. It’s okay, of course, for paladins to have some self-healing (they are a class with healing spells after all), but that has to be balanced against their better built-in damage mitigation. We try to tune tanking classes close enough so that they can all tank effectively, but without making them all function identically.<br />
<br />
We're not too concerned with keeping Protection viable in PvP. We know some players enjoy it, but the majority of Prot paladins are more concerned with their ability to tank, and that’s where we spend most of our Protection design effort. It’s a great goal to make all of a class's specs viable in PvP, but it's not always possible to do so and paladins have other options.<br />
<br />
I realize that Word of Glory is also on Retribution's platter at the moment, and we have something to share about its role in that spec as well, despite this being the tanking forum.<br />
<br />
We think the 4.06 changes overall gave Retribution too great a buff for PvP. We realize that there are those that disagree, but we're pretty firm on that point and we needed to make some adjustments. Given that Ret is primarily a dps spec, we thought it made more sense to reduce their off-healing capacity, which had become quite strong, rather than their damage.<br />
<br />
That's not to say that we mind a hybrid dps spec occasionally helping out with healing – that feels cool, and it's appropriate. On the other hand, we want damage focused specs to be primarily focused on dps. It's true that there were other ways we could have reduced Retribution healing. We could have changed Selfless Healer or even Word of Glory itself. As I mentioned earlier, after looking things over, we arrived at the conclusion that having a powerful heal you can use infrequently is more compelling than having a weak heal that you can use more often.

Discipline in 4.1<br />
<br />
We want Power Word: Shield, Power Word: Barrier, and Divine Aegis to continue to be an important part of a Discipline priest's rotation. We want you to use those spells frequently. The changes we've made through hotfixes and those that we currently have planned for 4.1. aren't intended to remove that element of gameplay at all, but simply refine it and bring it more in line with our design goals for the spec as a whole.<br />
<br />
As we've stated in the past (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2089271114?page=25#485), we don't want Discipline priests to use their shields to exclusion of everything else -- including, potentially, a more efficient heal. While damage mitigation is what Discipline priests are known for and something that you do very well, we also want you to cast important spells like Penance, Greater Heal, Prayer of Healing, and Flash Heal. Casting those heals doesn't make you a Holy priest, especially if you're using them to leverage other key talents in the Discipline arsenal (like Renewed Hope, Strength of Soul, and Train of Thought).<br />
<br />
Even so, we know that a lot of players want a class specialization that does nothing but shield, and that's fair -- but that's not the direction we want to take with Discipline priests right now. We want you to use the spell that's most appropriate for the situation, be that a heal, a shield, or an offensive ability like Smite. Your shields will still have their time and place, of course, and we'll make sure that you have good reason to cast them, but they just won't be the only thing you use to keep an ally alive.

Holy 4-piece set bonus<br />
This is feedback we've seen quite a bit, and it's good. With the changes to Chakra in 4.0.6, we realize a lot of players feel that the Holy 4-piece set bonus is currently much stronger than its Discipline counterpart. We don't disagree and it's something we've been actively discussing changing in 4.1 (for example, we're considering potentially removing the Weakened Soul requirement on Penance targets in order for the Spirit bonus to apply).

Triple spec is a good idea but I'd also like a gem swap thing, for example, back in WOTLK I gemmed all my feral gear for tanking meaning I couldn't dps and when I wanted to dps, I had to swap my stam gems to agi gems etc, meaning I couldn't tank so it would be good to be able to swap gems and enchants on gear, it also works for casters who maybe in heroics want less hit and more haste whereas in raids want more hit and less haste, or for healers to have int over spirit for short fights but spirit over int for longer fights.<br />
<br />
Also gives us more variation in PVP where you can gem your PVP gear for dps and swap to res/stam in arena if you want more durability.</div></div><hr />

Its more want to make a spell better based on feedback. unless somehow it now goes from a HoT to a CD and you dont trigger it with SM i dont think this is the CD they wanted to give us.

<br />
The 1st boundary would be whether the spec is fo PVP or PVE purposes. <br />
<br />
If you choose it to be your PVP spec, you will not be able to activate it during a 5 man dungeon or a raid instance.<br />
If you choose it to be your PVE spec, you will not be able to activate it during Battlegrounds, Arenas, or World PVP zones (TB and WG) - PVP Servers will act the same (No boundary for 'normal' world PVP)<br />
<br />
The 2nd boundary would be that you can not have multiple specs of the same specialization per play type, example:<br />
<br />
A warlock with 3 PVE specs would need to be Affliction, Demonology and Destruction.<br />
A warlock with 2 PVE specs and 1 PVP spec could have Affliction, Destruction (PVE) and Destruction (PVP)<br />
<br />
<br />
As for how Blizzard stated that people would use this system to create perfect builds for each fight, then yes I guess it would - but why should that matter? For hardcore guilds the best option is to optimize every player to perform at their highest abilities in each fight, some will probably go back to their trainer and respec simply to do that anyway. Having this tripple spec design just makes it more convenient and means less time waiting. <br />
<br />
Raids that are not as focused on progression and simply want to have fun are not obliged to respec to a more viable build for specific fights simply because its better for that fight, but they have the option to if they enjoy all 3 specs. <br />
<br />
anyway... just my opinion :)</div></div><hr />

No, your situation isn't silly. I play almost every day on my mage and I don't PvP at the moment simply because I have 2 PvE specs.<br />
<br />
A third spec for PVP ONLY would be brilliant and their argument of &quot;requirements and options&quot; wouldn't even come into it.<br />
<br />
It may be a challenge for blizzard but I am sure they could make it so that, unless you were in a PvP environment (i.e. In an arena or BG starting area), you couldn't switch to that PvP only 3rd spec.<br />
<br />
Their patronizing spin on things at the end of blue posts like this really grates on me. IF YOU ENJOY MUDDY SLOPES, GET THE HELL ON WITH IT &amp; JOIN THE PARTY!!<br />

For Resto Shamans, all our PvP talents have potential PvE-application as well, so you could find specialized PvE-builds employing them.<br />
<br />
If you're asking about my suggestion, there is no in game definition of a pvp spec. As I said, it is the player who chooses which spec would be PVE and which would be PVP, I guess this is the 1st problem that would arise with this system: a player has a PVE spec which is identical to their PVP spec, in which case they would need two identical specs but one marked as PVP and one marked as PVE to avoid being unable to use it in a certain zone. Although tbh is there a build in the game at the minute that is identical point for point for both PVP and PVE purposes?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felyna</div><div class="date">2011-03-02, 09:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tbh I don't see a problem with having tripple spec if there were boundaries to it -<br />
<br />
The 1st boundary would be whether the spec is fo PVP or PVE purposes. <br />
<br />
If you choose it to be your PVP spec, you will not be able to activate it during a 5 man dungeon or a raid instance.<br />
If you choose it to be your PVE spec, you will not be able to activate it during Battlegrounds, Arenas, or World PVP zones (TB and WG) - PVP Servers will act the same (No boundary for 'normal' world PVP)<br />
<br />
The 2nd boundary would be that you can not have multiple specs of the same specialization per play type, example:<br />
<br />
A warlock with 3 PVE specs would need to be Affliction, Demonology and Destruction.<br />
A warlock with 2 PVE specs and 1 PVP spec could have Affliction, Destruction (PVE) and Destruction (PVP)<br />
<br />
<br />
As for how Blizzard stated that people would use this system to create perfect builds for each fight, then yes I guess it would - but why should that matter? For hardcore guilds the best option is to optimize every player to perform at their highest abilities in each fight, some will probably go back to their trainer and respec simply to do that anyway. Having this tripple spec design just makes it more convenient and means less time waiting. <br />
<br />
Raids that are not as focused on progression and simply want to have fun are not obliged to respec to a more viable build for specific fights simply because its better for that fight, but they have the option to if they enjoy all 3 specs. <br />
<br />
anyway... just my opinion :)<br />
<br />
I like the idea of specifying a build pve or pvp. A third spec that can be defined as either pvp or pve would be nice. if pvp all your skills should be greyed out unless you are in a BG or Arena or TB/WG, and vise versa for pve.<br />
<br />
But to limit the specs so you can only have one of any specialization would be going too far. For example, I have two Affliction builds. One is my group/raid build which contains talents and glyphs that are more helpful to a group situation. Curse of Exhaustion isnt in this setup, but i have more DPS heavy items instead, as well as Glyph of Fear. In my pvp spec, i have CoEx as well as many more points into Demonology for health regen and instant HoT. Same specialization for both, but enough differences that being in the wrong spec for the wrong event is heavily noticable</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gnull</div><div class="date">2011-03-02, 09:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what's the point in the flag carrier change?<br />
<br />
The Twin Peaks and WSGs I've been in lately have turned into frustrating stalemates, where a couple of competent healers can keep the FC alive pretty much indefinitely. Getting one quick cap is enough to win the game by running down the clock if you have a couple of halfway decent pug healers.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I would like to see the change migrate to non-rated BGs too. PUG healing is just much easier to coordinate than getting a PUG to take down 3 healers hanging out with the FC. A healer can immediately see with Vuhdo or Grid where healing needs to go in the whole raid, whereas DPS needs to coordinate CC and target switches in order to take down multiple healers.<br />
<br />
Case in point, tonight I was in a (non-rated) Twin Peaks that just turned into a 20 minute long slugfest in each flag room. There were decent DPS on both sides, and people were doing the right things (hitting healers instead of dps, trying to interrupt and cc healers), but you just couldn't get enough coordination to take down the three healers in each room. We actually OOM'd all three healers at one point, but at that point someone (again, lack of coordination in a non-rated PUG) killed a healer, at which point they respawned in the GY and ran back in at full mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There are plenty of people in the exact same boat. I would like blood spec, frost kiting and pure dps spec, or some way to make it so I don't have to give up a dps talent to get chillblains. Tri-spec would be perfect.</div></div><hr />

I dislike this idea because as a druid if I had tri-spec I would have Main (balance), os (feral tank), oos (heals) and then by your logic I wouldnt be allowed to pvp, unless I was willing to not heal pve anymore</div></div><hr />

Triple spec is a good idea but I'd also like a gem swap thing, for example, back in WOTLK I gemmed all my feral gear for tanking meaning I couldn't dps and when I wanted to dps, I had to swap my stam gems to agi gems etc, meaning I couldn't tank so it would be good to be able to swap gems and enchants on gear, it also works for casters who maybe in heroics want less hit and more haste whereas in raids want more hit and less haste, or for healers to have int over spirit for short fights but spirit over int for longer fights.<br />
<br />
Also gives us more variation in PVP where you can gem your PVP gear for dps and swap to res/stam in arena if you want more durability.<br />
<br />
Nerfing pve stuff because of pve is not good. Perhaps they should just change it in the pvp settings only, we know this is possible.</div></div><hr />

Obviously having an array of possible specs to choose from would be convenient for any number of reasons, but it would also encourage situations where people are using it to shift their builds around for each individual encounter or task. Those are the kinds of options that quickly stop being options, and instead become a requirement.<br />
except we can already do that because we already have dual spec, is dual spec a requirement for every raid? no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the present time Im MS Tank with my 2nd spec alternating between Fury PVE and Arms PVP.<br />
<br />
You are of course, sometimes required to switch to dps when the raid enounter requires and its harming my efforts/dps if im stuck in my pvp spec doing less than considerable dps when I know If I went and spent X amount of gold and Y amount of time respeccing I could be stronger.<br />
<br />
Since I raid quite a lot its actually putting me off PVP as I cant be bothered with the hassle or respeccing, and re glyphing EVERY, DAMN, TIME.<br />
Its just getting a pain in the arse having to change my 2nd spec every time I wanna do a damn BG or arena.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
I would suggest a respeccing system that showed a list of 'recently used specs' would be a compromise.<br />
<br />
You would perhaps select the option from the respec trainer and you would choose from a list of recently used specs and glyphs. This could be a drop down showing the talent tree name and talent allocation of say your last 5 combinations. You would select one, pay the man some gold, /cheer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They JUST told you why it matters. It would become something they had to design talents/trees around and have to balance around. Balance is already hard as it is. They also just don't want spec switching 8 times per raid to be mandatory to be competitive. Just like they didn't like Rogues having to switch out weapons and other unintuitive mechanics. It makes plenty of sense...<br />
<br />
BUT...your idea of having a 3rd spec flagged for PVP and somehow only usable outside of 5/10/25m instances is a REALLY good idea. It's really the perfect way to do tri spec while keeping within the vision Blizzard has for spec changing and giving people a little more room for raiding and PVP. It would require a little more tech on their side that they would have to create but it's a great idea.<br />
<br />
EDIT - 2 posts above me also has a really good idea that would work well. You would need the Dusts of your character and the right amount of gold, but the class trainer should have an option of recently used specs/glyphs and in 1 click you can have your PVP spec/glyphs in.<br />
<br />
Take that one step further and have Reforging presets savable and that would make all kinds of things so much easier. Reforging all of my gear for each spec sucks. Blizzard DID say they didn't want Reforging to be a min/max feature (just a way to make gear you wouldn't normally want more valuable and to make stats that you have too much of still valuable) but it has become that, so this would be great.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they are talking about a measly troll raid. Clearly they are alluding to Zandalar, and - maybe I am jumping to conclusions but - I see the Blizz comment as something as close as you will see for now, of a hint at a Southseas expansion being closer around the corner than most people think. Several of the changes in 4.1 has convinced me that the leaked product slate is indeed non-fake, and we may well see an expansion spring 2012. That expansion will almost certainly be a Southseas expansion continuing storylines from Cata, as well as include the &quot;curiously missing&quot; parts of the Cataclysm. Do expect Kul Tiras, Zandalar and one or two additional undersea zones related to Queen Azhara.</div></div><hr />

Would it not be better to make a PvP debuff, where all the desired nerfs can be put in, to leave the non PvP (PvE) players like myself in vallue instead of making jobs like keeping a group alife and keeping mana a harder time just because they are &quot;overpowered&quot; in PvP. <br />
<br />
I honestly do not give about PvP, I like questing, doing 5 man instances and at times raiding, not killing other human players. If I did I would have chosen to play on a PvP server.<br />

I did not forget it. It just doesn't work. The original quote is set up like this<br />
<br />
I must (not-A.) I must defeat A. Defeat = negation<br />

I must (not-A.) I must lead A. Lead = not negation.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, biggest sin of MMO development, developing for themselves. <br />
<br />
&quot;Every so often I like to stop in and read up on how bad WoW is going. It's like a car wreck that you just can't turn away from. You see the two cars heading for each other, you know there is nothing you can do, so you watch. Then BAM broken characters, pissed off subscribers, and laughing devs everywhere. <br />
<br />
I know it sucks for people still playing, but for those of us that have moved to other games it's freaking hilarious.&quot;<br />
<br />
Heh heh couldn't agree more.</div></div><hr />

I whole-heartedly agree. Triple-spec is not needed because it would remove entirely having to make a decision on what talent tree you desire. Do you want to do PvP or PvE? Healer, tank, or dps?<br />
<br />
I'll admit that I have a slight bias in not seeing a triple spec, since I don't want to feel pressured in picking up Elemental. I already carry 3 sets of gear on me (resto, enh, &amp; pvp enh), I don't want to maintain a fourth.</div></div><hr />

For those lads and lasses who never read the book, if you have the time do it ;-)<br />
<br />
I must not fear. <br />
Fear is the mind-killer. <br />
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. <br />
I will face my fear. <br />
I will permit it to pass over me and through me. <br />
And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. <br />
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. <br />
Only I will remain.<br />

Have a dictionary handy if you decide to read the Dune Series. Good lord. Anything past God Emperor is a waste, imo.</div></div><hr />

I am trying to decipher what you are saying here. Are you saying Prot Paladin PVP won't be viable anymore? Is that a bad thing considering the disgrace that was tank specced paladins and warriors in WOTLK?<br />
<br />
BTW will you people stop complaining about 2v2 already?</div></div><hr />

It was a response to posts further up that were complaining about resto druids being overpowered in 2v2 and not that specific post that I had quoted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having 3 specs would make you have to maintain a 4th set of gear.....right. You can't use the same enh spec to pve and pvp as effective as if you had two different specs.<br />
<br />
No good reason to not introduce trispec. Anyone who says it would ruin the choice of choosing a spec is in some idealist dreamland.<br />
<br />
Some specs do better on certain fights. It would be nice for me to be able to PvE on my rogue as combat and assassination and switch fight to fight. But I am not taking the time to constantly respec and redo bars for my pvp spec. The choice shouldn't be to constantly respec or level another toon for pvp. A warrior in my last guild constantly had to do that. He tanked or dpsed and sometimes didn't get warning he would be tanking that night so we would have to wait for him to respec his pvp spec. Trispec would be a convenience change, that is all. It would not ruin the game in any way and it would not create these supposed balance issues that blizzard thinks would happen.</div></div><hr />

How in the frak is a meek 21k heal &quot;POWERFUL&quot;? Did Blizz forgot that we all have over 100k health at 85 and abilities that can cut down that health in the matter of seconds? <br />
<br />
No dps spec other then druid should be able to self heal itself better then Ret Pally's.</div></div><hr />
