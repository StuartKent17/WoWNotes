<br />
First, let's do a small summary of the 2.2 things.<br />
Mage Arena Season 2 set stats got changed. (Stats here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/mageseason2.jpg))<br />
[item=22861] and [item=22866] were changed (name and stats). (Stats (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/newflask.jpg), Blinding Light (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/blindinglight.jpg) and Pure Death (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/puredeath.jpg) mats lists.)<br />
New Arena shields. (Healing Shield (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/shield1.jpg), Spell Damage Shield (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/shield2.jpg))<br />
Old AQ enchants available from reputation vendor. (Few examples here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/newenchant.jpg))<br />
New epic gems (list here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/newgems.jpg))<br />
New Violet Eye rewards. (List here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/newvioleteye.jpg))<br />
Zul'aman monsters available in the game files, but not in game. (Preview here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/july/zulaman_monsters_small.jpg))<br />
2.2 Patch notes are hidden somewhere here<br />
DoTs damages are now lowered by resilience. <br />
You get reputation and trash loots from trash mobs in Hyjal Summit. (Reputation from boss lowered a bit)<br />
Duration of crowd control spells, most of them have been reduced to 10 sec (Seduce, Freezing Trap, etc ...)<br />
You can now transmute Nexus Shards into Small Prismatic Shards. (You can also split 1 Large Prismatic into 3 Small Prismatic)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People are getting banned from the official forums because of a Harry Potter Spoiler (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=301060195&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#12) (Don't click if you plan to read, obviously). Hopefully, this won't be our case, and we can finally give you the first spoiler : Harry Potter is a dwarf. <br />

<br />
<br />
Also, the change on the Blind skill was in the patch notes, but won't go live (and isn't even on the PTR it seems)<br />
<br />
This change is not implemented on the PTR and the note was removed. In short, the change was reverted at this point in time.<br />

<br />
thanks to embeded youtube's player item links are pretty useless. The player seems to have higher &quot;strata&quot;, than item tooltips. Maybe it could be better to move player at the end of news...<br />

All the shield has the same graphics. You can just check out Merciless Gladiator's Shield Walls and you'll know how it looks. ;)</div></div><hr />
