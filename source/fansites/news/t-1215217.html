Unique Challenge Mode Gear Effects<br />
You can find in game videos of all of the sets (except for Monk) on our Challenge Mode Armor Sets page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/932-Challenge-Mode-Armor-Sets).<br />
Challenge Modes are a new feature in Mists of Pandaria that allows coordinated 5-player groups to jump into Heroic dungeons and attempt to set time-trial records. These blindingly fast times are displayed for all to see, but if being famous on the interwebz wasn't enough, the groups who can achieve gold medals are also awarded with unique gear looks for use in Transmogrification-with a twist. These gear sets behave like nothing you've seen in the game before, activating and reacting to their wearer's combat actions.<br />
<br />
Check out the unique armor effects below-we think you'll want to grab some friends and give Challenge Modes a shot.<br />

Conquest Point Cap Clarification<br />
There has been some confusion lately regarding how Conquest Points are intended to be capped by the way that they’re earned. Conquest Point caps are divided into three categories.<br />
<br />
Rated Battlegrounds – The default Conquest Point cap for Rated Battlegrounds is set at 1650, and this can be raised with an increased Rated Battlegrounds rating. This cap is higher by default to reflect the greater challenges presented by organizing and participating in Rated Battlegrounds. Arenas – The default Conquest Point cap for Arenas is 1350, and this can be increased by earning a higher Arena Team rating. Random Battlegrounds – The default Conquest Point cap for points earned from doing Random Battlegrounds is actually dependent on the other two. It will rise to match whichever of the other two Conquest Point caps is lower. For example: if a player does no Rated Battlegrounds, but has raised their weekly Conquest Point cap to 2000 via a high Arena Team Rating, then the Random Battlegrounds cap will be 1650 to match the cap provided by Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
It’s important to note that this is not a recent change. This capping system has been in place since World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch 4.2. A recent hotfix resolved an issue that allowed players to gain Conquest Points via random Battlegrounds up to the higher of the two point caps, which was not intended.</div></div><hr />

It could be the only one of its kind, I still think the mount looks completely terrible. Especially for it to be a Blizzard store mount. At least some others such as yourself like it and can appreciate it.</div></div><hr />

The Quilin/Quilen in game are inspired by Shishi, the chinese guardian lions, which you might see, more often than qilin statues, in Chinese restaurants as mentioned above.<br />
<br />
<br />

While I liked the Celestial Steed and didn't care one way or the other about the Guardian mount... I find myself agreeing with your sentiment.</div></div><hr />

I'm an idiot, haha. I expected that to just be an armor video because of the &quot;except for monk&quot; text.</div></div><hr />

I didn't like those Quilen mounts from the CE of WoW either (hence why I just bought normal). Going to pass on this one, it's just really... ugly. In all honesty I can't see them making a great deal of sales on this.</div></div><hr />

To me it's just embarrassing to ride one because of how much they cost. At least with the Celestial Steed (my only store mount) it was one of the few bind-on-account mounts out there, but now with shared mounts...it seems like an utter waste of money. To each their own of course, but those are my feelings.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind too much, just what annoys me is that they hotfixed it halfway during the week, so people who got points earlier were able to fully cap, while others were not. And yet they wait til the end of the week for PvE adjustments to be fair. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

This capping system has been in place since World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch 4.2. A recent hotfix resolved an issue that allowed players to gain Conquest Points via random Battlegrounds up to the higher of the two point caps, which was not intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why does it say that you earn 50 conquest points if you win then? Doesn't that mean it's intended and they actually made it like that?<br />

They never admit they were wrong about anything, a bug they say..tsk tsk</div></div><hr />
