<br />
Tun, I'm not sure but I think the whole &quot;you guys get paid&quot; thing started back when the Nihilum and SK Gaming teams were separate. Maybe the whole mousesports sponsorship thing started the rumor.<br />
<br />
Beyond that maybe it results from jealousy, envy or people just like to start stuff.<br />
<br />
I heard this and thought, &quot;awesome!&quot; Gratz guys, I really like following your progress and ensidia.com is an awesome resource with tons of interesting information.</div></div><hr />

Go look @ the 10 man algalon world first by ensidia post, there is like a 12 page war about it, logically the whole theory behind it makes sense due to the UAE being filled with so many people which are that rich and most likely the prince would want this to be a secret is because wow is like the most socially unacceptable game in most peoples opinion. So don't be to quick to rage at someone without getting what he's actually on about :)</div></div><hr />

None of you get payed anything to beat the game? No sponsorcontracts, no nothing?<br />
Would almost seem like a good excuse to 'waste' all those hours on tryign to beat the game asap. (don't take 'waste' to negative.. we all have to think somewhere this game is a huge waste right?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
While I do not question their merits as a good guild, they are just able to dedicate absolutely insane hours to progression to be able to get these world firsts. That is all. <br />
<br />
I also believe that some of them do get paid, maybe just the officers but, there is no apparent reason why the members of Ensidia would pick up the name and carry it. They are sponsored by some group out in the United Arab Emirates. They will never publicly post that they have been paid ever.</div></div><hr />

But anyway good job. And FYI some of them do actually have jobs and go to school, they just focus a hell of a lot on raiding and do it 24/7 when not at work or school (and they are just all insane at WoW).</div></div><hr />

All for their epeen...which i mean idk if they get paid to play, and i really don't care, but the fact of the matter is that they will do everything and anything possible to satisfy their hunger for they little bit of fame they can muster...lol and i mean it makes them happy to hear everyone argue about how good they are and stuff, so all the people complaining about them...it aint helping anything<br />
<br />
one thing that matters is really who cares about world first anyways....if you can beat the thing anyways what difference does it make who did it first. Being better at this game will get you nowhere fast.</div></div><hr />

First off, you're a retard putting shit out of your ass. SK Gaming didnt want to focus on PvE anymore and stick completly to PvP, thats why they kicked their PvE guild and Mousesport's Johnny_R sold Nihilum behind their backs to mousesport - they left mousesports and fusioned with the old SK crew.<br />
<br />
They kicked most of the less skilled people and had 35 people in their guild, without any sponsors - and no, they dont get paid to play.<br />
<br />
Btw, lol @ Method killing Mimiron hardmore AFTER Ensidia released the video.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TwentyFifthNovember is now known as Ensidia<br />
TwentyFifthNovember, the guild created by members from both Nihilum and SK-Gaming is now officialy known as Ensidia. We'll probably hear about them again in a few weeks/months after the release of Patch 3.1 introducing the new Ulduar raid instance. <br />
<br />
Ensidia is a joint effort by members of two of the top guilds in World of Warcraft, with the support and endorsement of a private entity based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Our guilds have made being at the forefront of PVE progression our modus operandi since the first installment of this game and, as Ensidia, we will continue to do so.<br />
<br />
In addition, within the week, we will launch a guild web portal that will:<br />
<br />
<br />
•Be the hub for our guild members and likeminded folk.<br />
•Provide for the sizable hardcore/moderate population in our community.<br />
•Evolve to fit the complex tastes and needs of the WoW community in general.<br />
<br />
Check back here over the next few days.</div></div><hr />

Here (http://www.ensidia.com/home/news/interview-mackzter-mek.html) is a interview with Mek and Mackzter, the previous guild leaders of SK Gaming and now 2 of 3 GMs of Ensidia.<br />
<br />
Here's a couple of snippets:<br />
<br />
What is the new arrangement like, compared to your previous experiences with Mouseports and SK? <br />
<br />
We feel that the major difference here is that we are not just simply becoming a team in a big e-sports company. We don't really think any e-sports company has truly prioritized WoW and had the drive to really make it a central part of what they do, probably since CS and WC3 are still very big. We are really happy to be in a position where we have investment and top end management coming in from above but we are still a WoW guild and a WoW site and we have control over that as both guild masters and the development team. Overall we have a lot more freedom and control over things and that is immensely rewarding in comparison to our past endeavors. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there any truth to the rumor that you think all the players that didn't make the cut are bad, unskilled etc.? <br />
<br />
That really depends on how you define bad. We had two full guilds of players and we had to make that into one. There were a few players who we felt were not going to be good enough to make it in the new guild, so we had no choice but to cut them. Those players would not be considered bad, but we could only take the absolute best. We also had to consider personal issues and making sure that everyone would be able to work together, so skill wasn’t the only factor in the decision making. We then ended up with a roster of about 44-45 potentials and that has naturally been cut down to a manageable 35 through a process of natural selection. The guild is not a charity, we want the best players and real internal competition for spots. That is working really well right now, some people have left but what we have been left with is a really fantastic roster.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cchsballa06</div><div class="date">2009-05-20, 08:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are proud to announce the forming of a new force in World of Warcraft. Many of you will remember the guilds Nihilum and SK Gaming(Curse) from the past years, we have now decided to combine our strengths to create the number one team for Wrath of the Lich King and beyond. We have spent a considerable amount of time forging the greatest roster ever assembled in this game and we are now ready to take on anything that is released. To support this roster we have finally found an appropriately motivated team to back us and help us reach our full potential. Together we aim to deliver a much more professional and WoW tailored experience to the community than anything else that has been done in the past.<br />
<br />
At this point we are just offering a taste of what's to come. As the name suggests we are going to be doing our full launch on the 25th of November under a new brand but we wanted to let the community know that we are combining our efforts prior to this launch. So what is coming on the 25th? We are going to launch a new portal that's built around the guild with the goal of being one of the best World of Warcraft community sites. So watch this space until the 25th. You will find us leveling up on Magtheridon and striving for world firsts in the new wave of content.<br />

SK Gaming didnt want to focus on PvE anymore and stick completly to PvP, thats why they kicked their PvE guild and Mousesport's Johnny_R sold Nihilum behind their backs to mousesport - they left mousesports and fusioned with the old SK crew.<br />
<br />
They kicked most of the less skilled people and had 35 people in their guild, without any sponsors - and no, they dont get paid to play.<br />
<br />
Btw, lol @ Method killing Mimiron hardmore AFTER Ensidia released the video.<br />
<br />
<br />
Method killed Mimiron last night i.e. before Ensidia released their video. Actually Method killing him was the reason they released the video in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TwentyFifthNovember is now known as Ensidia<br />
TwentyFifthNovember, the guild created by members from both Nihilum and SK-Gaming is now officialy known as Ensidia. We'll probably hear about them again in a few weeks/months after the release of Patch 3.1 introducing the new Ulduar raid instance. <br />
<br />
Ensidia is a joint effort by members of two of the top guilds in World of Warcraft, with the support and endorsement of a private entity based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Our guilds have made being at the forefront of PVE progression our modus operandi since the first installment of this game and, as Ensidia, we will continue to do so.<br />
<br />
In addition, within the week, we will launch a guild web portal that will:<br />
<br />
<br />
•Be the hub for our guild members and likeminded folk.<br />
•Provide for the sizable hardcore/moderate population in our community.<br />
•Evolve to fit the complex tastes and needs of the WoW community in general.<br />
<br />
Check back here over the next few days.<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;The reason for it being released this &quot;late&quot; is because we were waiting for another European or American guild to kill it, we are releasing it now because a lot of people have been waiting for it and we want to be the first to do so.&quot;<br />
<br />
No, they didnt. And well, if I'd be Method, I wouldnt post a kill after a TW guilde aswell.</div></div><hr />

sponsorships don't equal &quot;paid to play&quot;. I can sponsor you to run in a relay and pay for your entry fee, pay for your website to help raise money for your foundation, pay for your new shoes, but good luck living off of that. You will still have to find a job to pay for your food/home/etc.<br />
<br />
Ensidia doesn't do &quot;endorsement&quot; commercials or use special gear when they play to boost sales...so your comparison to Michael Jordan is entirely different. I would not be surprised if Ensidia members, or at least some of them, occasionally got free swag on top of their web site and possibly game time being paid for by a 3rd party. But that hardly is the same thing as being paid to play. That is *gasp* being sponsored.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that is not true...if you're gonna use that comparison then why don't you look at it this way? ok a relay runner...idk olympians, nascar drivers, motorcross, and most extreme sports and anything like that they get paid to play or compete and be the best through their sponsors and endorsments...there is no way they could come up with the means to compete at that high of a level without being sponsored...it's different yes when you got professional sports like nfl, hockey, nba and mlb that are owned by either 1 person or a party, then those people actually are the ones paying you<br />
<br />
and yes free swag and having your game time paid for you is getting paid to play in my opinion</div></div><hr />

<br />
You cant be payed to raid, thats sure, but they can pay Ensidia so they can skip the work and stay home playing, having advantage over people who actually gotta work and cant spend all their time playing. I am not saying they all are getting paid, but Kungen probably does, so he can spend more time to keep guild running.</div></div><hr />

Right, because Michael Schumacher brought his own F1 to the champions cup.<br />
<br />
Sponsorship IRL != Sponsorship IG. Blizzard delivers the content, not the sponsor - MAYBE they get their website sponsored or some extra thingies like maybe BlizzCon tickets etc., but there is no one in the world who'd pay 35 people thousends of dollars to play the game. Mousesports nor SK did it, and the Dubai guy doesnt it aswell.</div></div><hr />

Method's was posted on 5-19 in the evening, Ensidia's video was posted on 5-20 midday...that 1 hour sure made a big difference didn't it? Ensidia ran into troubles getting the video fully uploaded, if you read the comments, but I can assure you that Ensidia posting their video was not the key to Methods victory. I'm sure watching a movie totally helped them more than 40+ hours of attempts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The difference is not 1 hour. Method killed Mimiron about 12 hours prior to Ensidia posting the video so, unless someone from Ensidia send it to them before hand, they could have not been able to watch it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pewpewarrows</div><div class="date">2009-05-20, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't see the big deal concerning whether the kill was before or after the video was released. There is no &quot;magical secret super-duper strategy&quot; for Mimiron Hard-mode. It's just pure execution of dealing with the spreading fires. It comes down a lot more to individual play than some secret raid positioning that would get revealed through the video.<br />
<br />
Kungen called Mimiron Hard-mode on the same level as Muru pre-nerf. Any guild defeating it at this point is definitely at the top of their game.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard delivers the content, not the sponsor - MAYBE they get their website sponsored or some extra thingies like maybe BlizzCon tickets etc., but there is no one in the world who'd pay 35 people thousends of dollars to play the game. Mousesports nor SK did it, and the Dubai guy doesnt it aswell.<br />
<br />
<br />
How about you open your mind a bit, use that brain of yours ? When you're an Arab oil tycoon with billions of dollars to your name, I'm sure that even tens of thousands of dollars don't mean shit. Hell... people with that kind of money rent yachts costing hundreds of thousands of dollars PER DAY. If the Dubai guy was that passionate about WoW, do you think he'd care about paying a couple dozen pimple-faced people a stipend for playing their favorite game with them? Get real.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I'll say this much. The only people in the world who know whether or not this whole Dubai-sponsorship is actually true are the members of Ensidia themselves. Just because you're Ensidia's #1 little fanboi and scream &quot;THE DUBAI GUY DOESNT IT ASWELL&quot; (yes, that is what you said) doesn't make it true. I don't know, YOU don't know, no one knows except for them. The only information we have is that this website (mmo-champion.com) reported the following, FROM ENSIDIA.COM:<br />
<br />
&quot;Ensidia is a joint effort by members of two of the top guilds in World of Warcraft, with the support and endorsement of a private entity based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.&quot;<br />
<br />
We also have Ensidia members flip-flopping and saying that they're not affiliated with any sponsors, period.<br />
<br />
You're free to use your own judgment here, but the truth probably lies somewhere in the middle...</div></div><hr />

<br />
And while druid dps is *quite* good, it's also absolutely the hardest rotation to play in the game, of all DPS class/spec combo's.<br />
<br />
<br />
And then in p4 end top 5 was 1 Feral druid and 1 DK and then 3 SP's?( 5 non-pure dps'rs :o )Since none of their warlocks play Affliction, Shadowpriest DoT dps is awesome for a fight like Mimiron with a insane amount of multiple targets.<br />

<br />
....Who the hell cares? Getting money for it doesn't reduce the fact that they did it. At the end of the day, Ensidia still did it first. Assuming the retarded rumor is true, then they were paid to be the best, and they proved they were the best. They didn't pay Blizzard to hand them the achievement, they still kicked its ass first.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, until somebody posts some actual, honest proof, not speculation, not conjecture, rumors, or 'I heard from my friend who had a friend in Ensidia/SKGaming once way back in the day' or anything, then it's all hogwash and stupidity to my ears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Jealous that I don't sit in front of a computer all day? Not the slightest. Would I like to see all the content in the game? Sure, but spending hours on end on raiding just ulduar and claiming world firsts (while you are being sponsored no less) is not impressive. Bottom line, is they have much more time to do it so of course they are going to get world firsts. Big surprise. IMO, it really doesn't show that they are incredibly skilled but rather they have too much time on their hands. I am sure they have plenty of skilled players, but whos to say that another guild couldn't get the job if we all had that kind of time?<br />

<br />
Ok, world first. What with it? <br />
It made you rich? No. It made you happy? I think of about a couple of hours before new &quot;callenge&quot;. It brought you enlightment? I don't think so. It made you famous? Yes, but, seriously, just think about it - being famous in ONE online GAME, does it cost all nerves and posts on mmo-champ?<br />
<br />
As I already said in previous &quot;World First&quot; - If you see a movie of world first - think about it, how to improve it or just move the same way to get same skill. Begin with yourself first of all. And when your guild will get this achievment - this will be YOUR &quot;world first&quot;. Isn't that better than posting here, blaming Ensidia?<br />

I seriosly cant understand why so much people envy Ensidia.<br />
IF they get paid, SO WHAT ? Do you all think SK-Gaming PVP team doesnt get payed ?<br />
Sure they do, damn even their CS team gets payed to play (monthly salaray , fee's to LAN and hotels etc etc).<br />
<br />
You are all a bunch of jealous dimwits. They get the game cleared. They get WoW firsts, who cares if they get payed. Its just means in any either way they are just better than all of you.<br />
<br />
Reminds me when i was getting my LAN fee's and hotels payed by our MAIN sponsor back in the days of COD4 and everyone said: you are all a bunch of noobs. (nobody knew us back then) And we steamrolled the LAN :). No more remarks after that. (months later we got sponsored by RedBull &amp; MSI) Huge flame but all jealous :) <br />
As long as theire's money involved you'll always have jealous dimwits who cant take it. Even if your sponsor is &quot;Joe's baker&quot; living 7 blocks from you and pays for your voicecoms and servers , etc.<br />
Take it like a man and just play your own game :D</div></div><hr />

These guys, are the best in the world at this thing.. maybe only at it, but they are nonetheless, the best.<br />

So if they got to play so well, and become so known, that they got sponsorship, that's frekken awsome, gratz to them for setting the bar right up there for the rest of us mere mortals.<br />

<br />
I agree with what you say about them being paid to play. If it's their only job, naturally they are going to do it. I'm sure they get paid a lot to make sure that they do get it first. It's just not the same as a group of &quot;normal&quot; people, for lack of a better term, working together and doing it. I can't really think of anything to compare it to, but there's just something not astonishing or respectable about a &quot;professional&quot; team of people getting world firsts... and getting paid for it. I'm not even sure why the Arabs care, really.<br />
<br />
This all applies if it is indeed true. I have no investigated it myself, but sources seem to be pretty staunch about the fact that they are paid professionals.</div></div><hr />

Seems people don't actually know how sponsorships work. It's a form of advertising. Why would some Saudi Arabian prince pay these guys out the wazoo (the rumored sponsorship) and do it in SECRET? What the hell benefit does that give him?<br />
<br />
Sponsorships are something done by a company so they can say 'look how awesome our team is. Buy our shit.'<br />
It's not something that's done anonymously, because that defeats the whole point of a sponsorship.<br />
<br />
Plus, congrats to what is obviously the best bunch of players on WoW. Everybody else is just a whiner.<br />

<br />
If aff locks would do more dmg would't they all have respeced?(but I guess the single target dmg they can do in p4 is more improtant)<br />
<br />
But my point is that p1 and most of p2 is straight up nuke, hell p1 require melee to run in and out and ranged can stand still and keep nukeing and still Tun topped that phase when I mean noone was even on par or close really, just suprised that's all :)</div></div><hr />

actually prince son plays WoW or something like that....<br />

The person behind Ensidia, Kungen, Mackzter and Meka is no less than the Crown Prince of Dubai, son of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. As I mentioned earlier, he’s been in the &quot;scene&quot; for years, he was a member of a number of top guilds with his brother and eventually ended up in SK-Gaming.<br />
<br />
Long story about real Ensidia<br />
http://serbandsteel.dingblog.com/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Justpassingby</div><div class="date">2009-05-21, 11:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far in both this and Algalon thread the rage keeps on coming. I want to clear a few things fast. Waste a few minutes of your precious time here with me :)<br />
<br />
A couple of times people already posted links to Serbansteel blog. It was quite a bomb the day it was written, but even if you put aside personal feelings of his and the whole drama, both parts of that blog contains a very intresting inside information. I will post them again, for new folks or someone who doesn't know the story:<br />
Part 1 - http://serbandsteel.dingblog.com/?loadblog=524&amp;cm=<br />
Part 2 - http://serbandsteel.dingblog.com/?loadblog=825&amp;cm=<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, this isn't another attempt to prove that Ensidia's members get paid for playing. Most of them don't. BUT there is a few, elite core you might say which does get their paychecks of some kind, in form of various finance help from certain person. And the main point - yes, leading core of the guild does have something other guilds don't. I'm not saying Ensidia doesn't have skilled players, you damn sure can't roll based on money only, and through the years both Nihilum and SK-Gaming gathered an outstanding group of raiders. And still, the question remains - if other guilds (let's say Method, just for example, put any other hardcore name in) could get financing for their leaders and officers as did Ensidia, would it be different? Will a degree of dedication go up a little? I think so. <br />
Last thing, the drama already passed a few months ago and was covered by various sources, with Ensidia public speakers changing their opinion and refusing then accepting some facts. Let's drop it for now and think for a minute - if you decide to believe Serbansteel and his version of story (and i assure you that guy didn't do it for shit and giggles) ask yourself if Ensidia really have advantage over some guilds. If personal connections managed to make a difference in this race of world fame at all. And finally, if it's even worth bitching about on forums :) <br />
P.S. I happen to know Serbasteel personally, and though you can dislike his usage of information he may gathered from the inside, he actually is a nice guy and a skilled player. Consider this as my small part +_+<br />

I'm not saying we shall alltogether hate Ensidia and refuse to aknowledge their achieved kills next second. But when a great number of people get kicked or leave guild before/after merge you can pretty much expect some of them expressing their feelings not only in MSN talks. And just happens you can't hide everything and cover up fcukups that big. All i'm saying - Ensidia does have advantage. Is it big or is it nothing worth mentioning every person can decide for themselfs, based on scraps of truth which we can get from guys like Serbansteel. Even though he had personal reasons to do what he did.<br />

You say u dont wanna discuss it or dwell on serbandsteel, yet you try u're very best to make this person as solid and trustwortyh as you can cause you happen to know him. <br />
<br />
And you try to also underline ensidia haveing an advantage over the rest, when there is no proof what so ever any1 in the guild has or is getting paid with money.Just some bitter ppl, serbandsteel included that has been kicked cause they were't good enoguh or did't fit in.<br />
<br />
You can try and paint it in all the colors of the rainbow but Ensidia is nr.1 cause they merged the 2 best guilds in the world and took only the very very best, so take your &quot;hidden&quot; attempt of trying to make it look like serbandsteel is't bitter and might more then likely streach the truth of things to make himself look good and ensidia as the big bad wolf just cause he did't make the cut and go find some actual proof of them getting paid or just stop being jelous to a degree that you cant just accept they are the best, no paycheck for killing bosses, not to the members,officers or GM's.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Justpassingby</div><div class="date">2009-05-21, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, it was my mistake and judgement to explain everything i wanted to say in the wrong way. Yes, i do know Serbansteel, not like we're best budds or anything, i just know him. And i took his blog only because it's the single one who had guts to post it. He lets his emotions overcome the main purpose about blog and i understand that. Once again - it's not about Ensidia NOT killing bosses or recieving paychecks per each of them. As i said, plain members do it for the fun or whatever drives them forward it. But the leadership does get help. I don't know what proof you want, to force &quot;leftovers&quot; of both guilds who decided to share information from inside so they post logs and screens? I've seen them, many did as well. It's not about Serbansteel, it's not about me or allmighty Kungen and others themselfs. It's about the simple fact that Ensidia - yes, is the best guild out there right now based on progress. Yes, they do have outstanding and skilled players. And yes, the leadership gets payed in ways which differs from simple &quot;paycheck per boss&quot;. <br />
<br />
I'm not talking out of envy here, i've stopped raiding myself some time ago and i'm just watching the community. But when half of the pages filled either with &quot;all of Ensidia members gets payed&quot; or &quot;None of them ever did&quot;, it makes me register and leave a few posts.

For the last time, you can say whatever you want about people who's been &quot;cut out&quot; so one guild can be made from two, but some of them were in for years, literaly years of gaming inside the guild and information that's been leaked several times isn't an act of some sick revenge - it's talking about an issue that's present. No doubt Ensidia will be the best out there for a long/short time, but the way things turns out for people who actually works their butt off for progress but can't make it through arrogance of single higher rank won't ever justify the result like /gkick.<br />

If you want to praise someone, praise actuall people who dedicated their time and hardwork to deliver all those kills, and not names themselfs, not &quot;Ensidia&quot;, &quot;Nihilum&quot;, &quot;Kungen&quot;, &quot;Mek&quot; or whatever. *added* Respect would be better though</div></div><hr />

What certain circles are you pointing at?<br />
<br />
And I cant see your point on arrogance, you talk like you'd want endisdia to be a big big guild and not have had any1 cut cause of their loyalty and long standing memberships?<br />
<br />
They are the best, to be the best you cant get all righteous and say we cant cut xxxxxxxxx cause they been in here so long, if that person would've been better at their task they would't be cut in the 1st place( tho a paranox is whoever has been cut is probably better then any1 in most guilds besdies ensidia at their task). They did't kick ppl just for the heck of it.<br />
<br />
You say praise the ppl behind the kills not just names like Ensidia, but you also type in the exampels Kungen and Mek, you dont think they played a part in the kills?<br />
<br />
And you underline it that your not one that has been cut from the merge but to me atleast you are talking like one.</div></div><hr />

And i'm not talking trash just for the sake of forum trolling, bad day i guess i even went on this :| But this is entretaining for me and i hope for everyone else, healthy talk never hurts.<br />
<br />
For pre-previous post - you miss the thing that drives me to write all of it. The biggest problem there is - management. You won't find that many current and ex Ensidia members who can say without hidden thought that they never had any problems how guild runs. But i'm not talking about it, we started from people who claim that Ensidia's members gets paid for playing, which is true only in case of.... that's right, the leaders. And the very same leaders gets everything usual ragging troll will put on simple member. That's the underline, that's the point, that's the case. 25 man dedicates their time, and in the end money makes the difference only for a close few. It wasn't &quot;best only&quot; who got in Ensidia. It wasn't &quot;best only&quot; who got raid spots. One person have powers enough to cast aside almost anyone for his personal &quot;dislike&quot; of him. And when you have someone like Neessaj working on guild's aspects for days and you have leaders who shows up after days on non-attendance for reasons like &quot;party&quot; and the very same person kicks someone for not attending a single raid - i call it plain bullsh*t right there. And that's attitude which gives that person arab sponsors, go figure.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's thread about different things, amaright? :) I'll have to stop my posts regarding Ensidia, i've said enough already. If you don't believe my arguments, fine, but next time you call someone rumormaker and looser, think for a minute if that person deserves it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yea your right think it was Mek who said in a quote that the cutting was't soley based on skills also personal issues. But dont it make sense to you that they'd want to cut any1 who has a personal issue with any of the managment to make sure the guild is as healty as it can be both on the inside and outside?<br />
Afterall they are supose to be a killing machine of new content without alot of internal bickering?</div></div><hr />

I can't help but see these guys as great dinosaurs though... and I mean that in a respectful way. I think uber guilds, in WoW at least, will soon become extinct.<br />
<br />
We all know the argument... uber guilds find the content unchallenging, Blizzard are struggling to keep up and develop new content to satiate the player base's voracious appetites... they realise that their player base is largely composed of casual players and steer towards content designed to make people log on and keep subscribing.<br />
<br />
It's obvious that Blizzard are steering the game away from having to develop raid content at the pace set by the hardcore guilds, so I think that either guilds at the level of Ensidia will bail from WoW eventually, or just reduce their raid schedule to an evening. Maybe it will take another punishing Korean MMO like Lineage 2, with bottom-lip trembling penalties for dying to offer these guys a suitable challenge?<br />
<br />
I've said it before on these forums, but I can see a developer making an MMO comprised solely of hardcore instances. No levelling game, no levels. Just an armor tier grind with nigh-on impossible but very well tweaked raid content. That's all these uber guilds want anway, so why not cut straight to the point?<br />
<br />
<br />
Your statements strike me as odd, when I read the stuff on Ensidia's website. They have talked about how an encounter like hard mode Mimiron is the hardest in the game and one of the most well-tuned fights in WoW, and constantly go on about their love for the game. Hodir hilarity not withstanding, I've read nothing but positive stuff about Ulduar from Ensidia, so where does your 'uber guilds don't like the content' argument come from?<br />
<br />
There will always be super guilds, 'nuff said. They'll change, the names will change, and the players will change, but there will always be super hardcore guilds. If there can be 'super hardcore Super Smash Brothers' players, there'll certainly always be super hardcore WoW guilds.</div></div><hr />

Bullshit! Absolute bullshit! WoW is THE best MMO out there, they play this game because they love it. They could play ANY MMO out now and destroy the raid content fast as long as it's not made impossible because they are 100% organised, dedicated, skilled and hungry for the spotlight. That's the sort of guild that will find any raid a breeze in the sun.<br />
<br />
They play WoW simply because it's the best MMO out there, it's one that they enjoy the most. Not because of the challenge, they wn't swithc to find a bigger challenge because there won't be one, they are too good for any doable raid in an MMO.</div></div><hr />

I like people that read topics they &quot;don't care&quot; about and posting in those topics to show how little they actually care.<br />
<br />
Last time i checked this is a WoW related site with WoW related forums so my guess is most topics will be WoW related. If you want to discuss politics, economy, global warming etc. there are tons of sites, blogs and forums you can find and post. Of course here you might seem &quot;smarter&quot; when discussing those topics, because chances are people are not that interested and thus acquainted with the subject.<br />
<br />
@Justpassingby: As far as I have read the only ex-Ensidia player posting negative stuff about the guild is Serbandsteel. For example i have not heard a bad word out of Marilyn and he was in Nihilum way longer not to mention being an officer. Of course i don't sit on IRC all day nor do i have any contacts inside the guild, but for the outside observer the drama in and around the guild seems to be next to 0.<br />
<br />
Furthermore if the management is so shitty how come those players stick to playing for that management? If only the leaders get paid and the rest of the guild knows that, it is bound to cause problems and yet their main roster seems quite stable. You can say they stick with Ensidia because of world firsts, but if most of the players, currently in Ensidia, join another guild, that guild will very likely be a competitor for world firsts.<br />
<br />
But that is nothing new there will always be people hating on the best guilds in the world. Hell this barely resembles the drama that was during the DnT vs Nihilum era - they used flasks, they got the fix on cleared instance, we had our boss despawn for 3 days, they used 25 SS and so on.</div></div><hr />

They are the best, it really is that simple.<br />

And let´s asume they get payed to play (no matter if this is true or not) the fact still stands.<br />
They aren´t good because they get payed, they get payed because they are good!</div></div><hr />

Ulduar as a whole has been fantastic, and ensidia is right about mimiron. It was an extremely difficult hardmode, but it was also extremely satisfying to finally kill. Even more satisfying than any other boss I've ever killed.</div></div><hr />
