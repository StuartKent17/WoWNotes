<meta name="description" content="Changes to Alterac Valley mines in 2.3 
More changes will be made to Alterac Valley in 2.3, and Salthem explains why mines are going to be more useful. 
 Just as a quick update to this, I have updated the opening post with some further changes planned for the 2.3.0 PTR: 
If a side controls a mine, then every 45 seconds they will gain 1 supply. If they control both mines, then they'll get 2. 
No side can ever have more than the max number of supplies (currently the max is 600)

No side can ever have more than the max number of supplies (currently the max is 600)<br />
The Herald yell text for taking a mine includes a line about getting reinforcements for owning it.<br />
The 45-second ticker is on an independent timer (i.e. the first &quot;+&quot; a side gets for controlling a mine won't be 45 seconds after they take it. It'll be somewhere between 1 and 45 seconds -- whenever the ticker ticks). <br />

OMG Void Reaver down in 53 seconds !<br />
You probably heard about a Void Reaver kill (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/vr53.jpg) performed in 53 seconds with the help of a particular monster (Let's call him Mr. Smith). Even if it looks fun, I could be a good idea to not do it if you don't want to make some GMs very sad, thanks for them.<br />
This topic is the result of a known issue in the game mechanics.<br />
Use of this issue in this fashion is considered an exploit and I strongly discourage you from using it in order to avoid any repercussions on your account.<br />
<br />
Rest assured that issues such as this will be resolved in order to remove the temptation. :) <br />

Wintersabers faction changed in 2.3<br />
First, keep in mind that this is a PTR change and maybe it won't affect live servers when the patch is released, but it seems that the reputation with Wintersabers Trainers will be much easier to grind in 2.3, the reputation awarded by repeatable quests has been changed from 75 to 250. <br />

Sigh.. So all my hours grindin that freakin place was all worth nothing? How can Blizzard do that to their customers? Make someone be there for weeks doing something over and over again as a special challange to see if you can make it and if you do they give you an awesome mount thats very unique - and then just let everyone else get it practically for free?

It's called progress. That's what the game does. It's really not 'practically for free' and at the very worst, you've had your uber unique mount for a while longer than anyone else. And at least you can say you earned it the 'old way' :p</div></div><hr />

They must have thought &quot;Hey, nobody in his right mind would to that kind of mind-blowing boring grind! Let's change it for normal people!&quot;.<br />

<br />
It's something reserved for people who really want it atm, considering its just a mount and does not affect others gameplay. Atm they are rare on a server, bit like the strat and zg mounts and i think it should stay that way.<br />
<br />
Its nice to see some rare mounts or pets or whatever once in a while, makes WOW more insteresting.<br />
<br />
If you really want it you can get it in a few months or even weeks if you play the entire day. I think its fine as it is atm.<br />

Nah, the first C'thun kill was definitely an exploit, though some call it a hack more than an exploit. For those who don't know, they wrote a mod to remove a wall in AQ40, so they killed skerham, then went straight to C'thun. Anyways, guild firsts are noted by blizz. A big flag will go off if a guild kills lootreaver before a second boss in SSC. Make sure you have a legit kill first, though with the number of guilds killing him, I doubt blizz is really going to get hardcore on this. Just don't use it consistantly.</div></div><hr />

In case you missed the actual meaning of the term exploit I'll give you a freebie:<br />
<br />
Exploit: To gain some advantage by doing things that clearly isnt part of the normal, intended game mechanics. Yes..things which Blizzard missed or just didnt intend.<br />
<br />
<br />
But hey.. an ability, which grants insane dps without either cooldown or global cooldown, is naturally intended to be used. I'm sure that ignorance is bliss ;)<br />
<br />
In most cases people who use exploits are aware it's wrong. It's their choice so they cant exactly cry when they are banned :)</div></div><hr />

Wasn't the first C'thun kill (Not even the 100th)<br />
<br />
They had C'thun on farm for months.<br />
<br />
They didn't wrote any mod.<br />

They altered a MPQ file.<br />

Seriusly Chorizia, Blizzard do log EVERY kill that is made, trashmob, boss, player etc.<br />
<br />
Just take a look at http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/gamestats/gamestats.html?en,killedby<br />
(yes this is a list of how many kills did a monster get, but if they log this they also log every player made kill.)<br />
<br />
Of course Blizzard knows when a guild has their first kill, and if they are smart got some internal checker that flags it when ever something out of the ordinary is done.</div></div><hr />

Guilds dont kill raid bosses, raid groups with a RaidID do, thats why you see almost every week someone complaining on the forums cause they got their ID stolen and some randoms get their Karazhan ID.. and when thats happening, a guild is killing bosses without having killed the previous one, and NOTHING happens..<br />
<br />
And what about random unguilded PuGs?<br />
<br />
Sorry, just no.<br />

<br />
I'm sure that by 'stolen' you mean improved and ofc you mean that Blizz has EVERYthing a player can need in terms of feedback.<br />
Yes they take every possible 3rd party's idea and why? Cause it's not copywrited. Blizz has no copyright over their unique monsters. LOTRO can publish a critter named Illidan and Blizz has nothing to do about it...<br />

<br />
Nah having a v. rare mount accessible via a grind that was already very doable for someone with a busy life isn't progress (I'm usually all for progress but this is over the line). It's even easier to get it now than before as they changed it from 50 to 75. Now people have 10% increase in mount speed (20% if the player is a paladin or has access to one) and the biggest change of all is that winterfall village is not farmed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
like they did for the ssc/tk access<br />
<br />
Can't compare those attunements to wintersaber grind. You know that awful grind enchanters whined about called Timbermaw? If you _only_ focused on wintersaber grinding you would get exalted with timbermaw a very long time before getting anywhere close to exalted with WS.<br />

So? I got 14 rank, after 2 months I felt cheated when every noob could get 14 rank items.<br />
<br />
I love your mentality: &quot;I got cheated so you should feel cheated too!&quot; As a rank14 with WS mount people being able to get r14 gear was fine especially when we got our ranks back. Remember our rank kept degrading and our r14 would be long time gone. Even the updated pvp gear was beginning to be outdated unless you were a what you call a &quot;noob&quot;. So there you were stuck with no r12-14 gear and no title. In fact I'm pretty glad this whole thing happened unlike with the WS mount.<br />
<br />
You don't need to do it all in one go, the rep doesn't degrade, and as I stated above it's already so much easier. Rep increase is _huge_ and imo a slap in the face for those who have a busy life but had the moral to go through such a grind.<br />

Anyways that's my 2cents.</div></div><hr />

So all my hours grindin that freakin place was all worth nothing? How can Blizzard do that to their customers? Make someone be there for weeks doing something over and over again as a special challange to see if you can make it and if you do they give you an awesome mount thats very unique - and then just let everyone else get it practically for free? I feel pretty cheated...<br />

It was obvious to everyone in the world that grinding Wintersaber rep was a pretty pointless thing to do, the only thing it ever gained you was e-peen. And you still have that, now you can lord it over people and say &quot;lol I got my Wintersaber before they nerfed it lol&quot;. That'll get the chicks.</div></div><hr />
