Pandaria Faction Capital Changes<br />
The last patch added some of the things that people have been requesting since we originally previewed (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2796-Flight-in-Pandaria-Ne..) the new Faction Capitals. You can now find a Void Storage and Transmogrification NPC near the Reforging NPC. Training Dummies have also been added outside of the city and the Horde city now has the 60% speed buff to help you get around quickly. Finally, all of the NPCs have dialogues and sell the items that they are supposed to!<br />

Lorewalker Story: Between a Saurok and a Hard Place<br />
In Mists of Pandaria there are several extra lore related achievements (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/character/exploration/pandaria) to go with the regular zone exploration achievements. <br />
<br />
Once you have found all of the objects for an achievement, Lorewalker Cho will send you mail that asks you to meet him at the Seat of Knowledge. Once there he will narrate a small story that gives you some more information about Pandaria lore. <br />
<br />
In the video below, the Between a Saurok and a Hard Place (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/6716-between-a-saurok-and-a-hard-place) story is told to you.<br />

World Boss Preview<br />
Blizzard published a preview of the Salyis's Warband encounter today, but if you want to see a video and the full list of skills, check out our new boss pages! Loot tables are not available yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/august/salyis.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/710-Salyis-s-Warband-Pandaria) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/august/shaAnger.jpg (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1265-Sha-of-Anger-Pandaria) <br />
<br />
Check out the Mists of Pandaria preview website and get a first glimpse at one of the two new roaming world bosses: Salyis’s Warband (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/world-boss/salyis-warband)! These extremely powerful monsters will do everything in their power to make your life more... “interesting” as you explore the mysterious continent of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
World bosses spawn in the open world and can be attacked by any player (un)fortunate enough to cross their paths. Salyis's Warband will be quite rare, while the expansion's other boss will appear with fairly regular frequency. But before you charge headfirst into battle, keep in mind that it will take the combined efforts of a full raid to bring one of these guys to their knees.<br />
<br />
Taking down a world boss is no small feat, but the rewards make it all worthwhile: achievements, fabulous items, and massive bragging rights will all be yours if you and your comrades in arms succeed in felling one of these roving terrors. Check back soon for more info on the game's other world boss, the Sha of Anger!

Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter))<br />
I've been trying to get accurate pet focus regen numbers but it's difficult to test accurately in game given the limits of the display and the fact that none of it ends up in the log. Currently it looks like the base pet focus regen is around 5 fps, but is it possible a blue poster could confirm if that's the correct number? It would also be extremely helpful if pet focus regen (and crit chance for that matter) were added to the pet display.<br />
<br />
Also if I'm testing correctly, it looks like spiked collar does not increase pet focus regen (even though it is called haste and not attack speed). Which haste and attack speed bonuses increase regen for pets has never been incredibly clear or consistent. The terminology doesn't seem to be a reliable clue and measuring pet focus regen precisely is difficult. Is there a chance of this getting clarified at some point?<br />
Base pet Focus regen is 5 per second (which is different from base hunter Focus regen, which is 4). Spiked Collar is indeed just attack speed, not actual haste; we’ve fixed the tooltip for the next build. Thanks for pointing that out. Same with Berserking; we’ve updated that to say Haste instead of Attack Speed.<br />
<br />

Question about the Guardian 4pc bonus. Does the 10% to Savage Defense mean: <br />
<br />
0.45 * 1.1 = 0.495<br />
or<br />
0.45 + .1 = 0.55 <br />
It was multiplicative, but since that can be read ambiguously, we’ve adjusted it to say that it adds an additional 5% dodge chance (yes, that’s a very slight buff).<br />
<br />
I dont know if its intended but the last spell cast in ether Eclipse is not buffed when fully cast. For example, when casting wrath with 15 or less solar energy the spell says its buffed however when the cast completes it uses the unbuffed damage. The same for starsurge and starfire in lunar. Its very misleading.<br />
Unintended; we’ll get that fixed.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk))<br />
Any there any plans to change the way Shuffle refresh is managed for Brewmasters?<br />
<br />
What I mean in regard to this is how Shuffle is unable to refresh to the full 12 sec duration unless it is 6.0 seconds or below. At the beginning of a Shuffle application you can get it to 12 seconds. However at any point above 6.1 seconds Shuffle will never refresh to 12 seconds. This makes it very frustrating because you have to watch the time on Shuffle to be below the 6.0 mark to reapply it. I understand a Brewmaster wouldn't want to waste Chi by reapplying Shuffle too early or often but even at 6.1 seconds it will just waste 2 Chi without increasing duration to 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't even mind if you say had Shuffle at 7 seconds and did a BoK that it went only to 12 seconds (the cap right now of time) than simply eating our 2 Chi and that's that. However, I think it'd be best if any reapplication of Shuffle above 6 seconds should automatically refresh it to 12 seconds.<br />
In the build after next, you’ll find that Shield Block, Savage Defense, Shuffle, and Shield of the Righteous will always add their duration to the existing buff if there is one, instead of just adding an imaginary tick. If you hit Blackout Kick with 7 seconds left on Shuffle, it’ll go up to 13 seconds remaining.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman))<br />
There are several changes coming for shaman in the next build, some of which won’t be easily datamined, so we’d like to let you know about them. We shifted around where damage comes from for both Elemental and Enhancement. The overall damage should be down a bit, but both specializations should still feel strong. Remember, if you’re giving feedback and making comparisons to other classes and specs, please list who you’re comparing to, as it’s quite possible that you’re feeling underpowered compared to someone who is overpowered.<br />
<br />
The Fire Elementals were stronger than we wanted, so we reduced the amount of spell power that the standard version gets to 40%, down from 55% (Primal: 60%, down from 82.5%). The Primal Elementalist talent was also too strong, so we reduced the damage of the Primal Fire Elemental’s Immolate DoT by 65%. Also on the topic of talents, Elemental Blast was too weak, so we increased its damage and stat effects by roughly 17%, but reduced its proc chance with Echo of the Elements to 6% for Enhancement (previously it had a 30% chance to trigger an Echo for Enhancement, which made that talent pair too strong).<br />
<br />
Further, on the topic of shocks, we recently reduced the shared cooldown of shocks to 5 seconds for Elemental shaman. More recently, we lowered Earth Shock’s damage a bit and significantly increased Flame Shock’s damage.<br />
<br />
Specific to Enhancement, we wanted to bring DPS down a bit and also make them feel like more of their damage was coming from their active buttons, rather than passively. The one significant change that you probably won’t be able to datamine is an increase to Feral Spirits’ damage. They now get 50% of your attack power each, up from 30%. And their Spirit Bite ability’s damage has more than doubled. The net result should be that Feral Spirits are significantly stronger than before, probably somewhere between 70% and 100% stronger, depending on gear.<br />

Renew seems to be benefiting from 15% bonus when in Chakra: Serenity-- akin to it being considered a Single Target Heal. Additionally, it also seems to be auto-refreshing (and thus, gaining an additional tick). Is this intended performance? If so, it dramatically affects the value of Renew and its corresponding Chakra: States as well as the Glyph of Renew when running Sims and Spreadsheeting haste values. <br />
The 15% benefit to Renew from Serenity is intended. We decided it made more sense to associate Renew with Serenity and not Sanctuary. Renew refreshing itself to get that extra tick is not intended and we will fix. <br />

Beta Raiding Class Balance<br />
When I'm being outhealed by a factor of two by any Joe Schmoe paladin or monk who happens to wander into a raid...I'm sorry, but skill is simply not going to overcome that. I don't even want to think about what a good paladin could do. At least not until I have one. <br />
<br />
But be realistic. Do you think Blizzard will let such a disparity last into Live and if so, for any real determinate amount of time? Even during &quot;Your class brings utility, shut it&quot; era of TBC the numbers never went for that big of a spread.<br />
It's probably not possible to overcome that much of a difference. Fortunately, you don't have to, because paladins and monks both had some egregious bugs that inflated their healing. We actually hotfixed those bugs but then a new build broke them again. Until you get a new build or we hotfix the issues again, you are probably better off comparing druid, priest and shaman healing. I apologize for any inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Overall, I would recommend not deciding who you're going to bench based on beta testing until we are very close to ship. It's not a great strategy to try to get your character buffed either.<br />
<br />
there being no Spirit whatsoever on the Legendary Sha weapons<br />
Well, the weapons themselves aren't legendary, but the Intellect mace (http://www.wowdb.com/items/86990-kritak-imperial-scepter-of-the-swarm) is supposed to have Spirit on it. That's a bug.<br />
<br />
Also one thing to consider is that benching and stacking of classes in the top guilds has less to do with SimCraft numbers and more of certain mechanics being very powerful on certain fights. Case in point: Paragon's 11 Druids on their first Heroic Nefarian kill.<br />
Agreed. Remember guilds in those world first situations are doing content very undergeared compared to what we expect because they are skipping the weeks of farming. In those situations players have to resort to some unusual strategies to make up the difference. In general (though not always depending on what they feel like they have to do) those type of machinations are fun for the guilds in questions and very few players are affected overall.<br />
<br />
When we see widespread stacking, that crosses the line. In retrospect, the dependence on quick burst for a fight like Spine might cross the line. Overall, we didn't see a ton of stacking or sitting for the Cataclysm raids and we'll try to do even better for the new content.<br />
<br />
For the record, I believe there is evidence the PW: Solace thread that druids are outpacing priests and shaman as well, but not nearly as much, the major issue seems to be the longevity.<br />
That is possible. As I have said repeatedly, if every priest is taking Solace, we'll continue to nerf it until the perception is that it is on par with the other talents. We don't want Solace to be a required talent. <br />
<br />
I believe we have the paladin and monk fixed and we have some more raid testing ongoing so we'll be able to get some better data.<br />
<br />
We're in a situation again where we have made several changes to a variety of class mechanics but haven't been able to get a build up with fresh data.

Feeback on Priest Changes<br />
This is a combination of responses to some points in this thread and a couple of others, such as the &quot;bench&quot; thread.<br />
<br />
When we stop seeing posts that rank Solace priests ahead of Mindbender priests, then we'll feel like the talents are in a better spot. Not every priest wants to have to cast nukes as part of their healing rotation, and we are just not going to make Solace mandatory. If you enjoy the style, awesome. That talent is for you. You shouldn't have to take it though. (When I heal, I tend to play the mana game a lot, because healing just enough without overheating is fun for me. Rather than overheal, I'll gladly sit idle a lot rather than waste a heal. Solace would work well for me. Other healers, even some I play with, want to stay more active and keep spells queued up and cancel them or just keep everyone topped off. That's cool too. The game supports lots of different healing styles, except for the one where you just spam your highest HPS spell and nothing else, which hasn't been supported since Icecrown.)<br />
<br />
We're not noticing a big longevity problem between priests and druids. Shaman seemed a little low so we are examining the impact of the Water Shield and Resurgence chances. We may also lower the cost of Healing Rain. It is definitely a challenging thing to sim out how much mana the various healers use because it has a lot to do with spell choice. You should be able to use your more expensive heals somewhat, but you should also be casting a lot of Heals as well. <br />
<br />
We don't feel like mana regen in 5-player dungeons is at all a problem. Mana felt tighter (too tight in retrospect) in Cataclysm launch. If you are running out while healing a dungeon boss, I would suspect it's because you are using Flash and it's equivalents too often or you're just used to the rapid mana regen of full Dragon Soul gear. It's possible mana is tighter in raids, especially 25 player, but we're running a lot of raid tests right now and it's just not a common theme we're hearing from those players, which again leads me to want to understand what is going on for players who feel they are struggling. Again, being as specific as possible would help. Which bosses? How far into the fight are you struggling for mana? How quickly are you having to Shadow Fiend? Are you wearing Mists quest greens, Mists PvP gear, or scaled up Dragon Soul raid gear?<br />
<br />
Returning Holy Concentration to a higher value is extremely unlikely. We felt that created more class balance problems than it solved. We are more likely to lower priest and or shaman heal costs if we think it is needed. We just don't want to be in a situation where we improve priest and shaman healing now and are then forced to nerf them after launch. Nobody will be happy with that outcome. <br />
<br />
I'll dig into the &quot;Realistic 60 sec Holy priest average&quot; posted. You shouldn't feel, with any mana talent choice, that are you are sitting around a lot too scared to heal. (The example I used for my healing style above is just one play style, not the only valid way to play. I could overheal a lot more and still be fine.) The risk should be that any time you replace a Heal with a Flash Heal that it's going to hurt a little, but sometimes that is still the right call. A priest casting nothing but Heal should last indefinitely. That isn't true of say a paladin who uses a lot of free spells. PW:Shield for Disc is a little more risky. It has a lot of benefits, but overall you should be rewarded for shielding folks who are taking damage and not just throwing it around indiscriminately on the raid. The former should benefit you through Rapture. The latter should slowly run you OOM.

<br />
Content Difficulty and Consumption Speed<br />
If blizzard actually believe LFR keeps people interested beyond 2 weeks, I am SERIOUSLY worried for the game. They must see how shallow and short spanned it is.<br />
There's a broad spectrum of players on this game. And the LFR is interesting to some of those players, just as Heroic, soul-crushing bosses are interesting to a different set of players, and then you get everything in between. The community is way more different that what some of you think it is. Even the motivation behind each of us is entirely different in some cases. Some might raid for the loot, some might raid for the lore, others for the achievements, others for the challenge, others for the social experience of tackling content with their friends... and so on.

The developers haven't decided yet how they'll handle it, but it's likely they'll make some adjustments. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/231567-madness-heroic-and-ragnaros-heroic-mounts/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5071488033?page=1#4))<br />

Are you people incapable of remembering what was said only a few weeks ago? Do you choose to only take the information you see right now, and ignore all previous information?<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler said that several classes would be getting a DPS Nerf to bring them in-line with all other classes. Remember that they're several builds ahead of us, with class tweaks and changes that are not published or shown.<br />

And yet Shattrath and Dalaran still managed to be fairly populated cities without auctioneers, now didn't they? The only reason people converged on Stormwind and Orgrimmar was because the portals to the cata zones located there exclusively. While these weren't nearly as essential after the initial burst of questing was done, people just stayed there out of habit. <br />
<br />
The new cities in Pandaria present a geographical convenience, just like Shattrath and Dalaran did back in their respective expansions.<br />

I do, however, hope that they come around to at least allowing ground mounts in the cities. <br />

When i read &quot;Faction Capital Changes&quot;, i was so excited! New buildings in SW? Park district rebuilt?<br />
<br />
Great disappointment =,( <br />

I know... it'd be awesome if they could merge a pandaren district with a worgen district and put it where the park used to be... a fusion of the Gothic English Gilnean architecture with a few interspersed dark &quot;colonial china&quot; type Pandaren buildings would look great.</div></div><hr />

Still incorrect. In vanilla you had a flawed Enhancement system relying totally on RNG from WF, you had Elemental which was just.... And then you had resto which wasn't exactly fantastic either, but it was a healing spec.<br />
<br />
It got a little better in TBC, especially for Enhancement.<br />
<br />
Little better in Wotlk, when all three specs recieved new spells and abilities - though a lot of people moaned about Enh using agi instead of str.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm - meh.<br />
<br />
MoP - lots and lots of wierd changes and nerfs for no reason.</div></div><hr />

Over the years it seems like Shamans have always gotten nerfed , many that made you scratch your head. Mainly because at many times over the years, certain specs were not very good, yet they'd get a nerf anyways. There'd always been a running joke that whenever there was a new patch, shamans would get nerfed. And it was usually the case. That's all I was saying. I know that at this particular moment they're buffing/nerfing things to try and even it out for Mists and IMO this is the best classes have been balanced, ever. I don't care what happens, I'll always play the class because I love it. I was just pointing out that over the years they've always gotten the nerf bat.</div></div><hr />

They said they ll be changing how dispelling on spine will work(cant link source atm,its on mmo champion as well),also you ll still have 35% nerf(assuming they add new nerf around 5.0) so I think it wont be that bad as you predict.</div></div><hr />

There was also class imbalance, bugs galore to make difficulty, disconjorted questing with horrendous quest drop rates, and unbalanced difficulty in vanilla, as well. Maybe they should break everything in MoP to recreate the nostalgia.<br />

I do agree that there should be incentive to go out and &quot;see the world&quot;, but creating artificial time sinks that do nothing but waste your time is not what I consider fun.

No one said anything about all of Vanilla. I mentioned that you didn't have the awesome chance to port everywhere as you do now. Even in Cataclysm, you still had portals to majority of places, so when he claimed it was a &quot;pain&quot; I just laughed out loud. Besides, everything you mentioned are exaggerated and made to seem as though Vanilla was unplayable. Completely not true.<br />
<br />
Traveling is a way of getting around. Portaling is just being lazy. No matter how much you say &quot;it's not fun!&quot; that's not the point. MMO's are MMO's, and they're meant to be time sinks, not convenient games that you can play during your break.<br />
<br />
At least... they used to be. It's getting rid of more immersion in a game I feel lost it long ago for the exchange of &quot;fun&quot;. I guess we have two different definition of those words.</div></div><hr />

Then we lowered the average damage of Elemental Blast by reducing its chance to echo, and increased the damage of Feral Spirits (Which deals its damage progressively over the course of 30 seconds)&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzard in charge of doing what they set out to do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2012-08-07, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are several changes coming for shaman in the next build, some of which won’t be easily datamined, so we’d like to let you know about them. We shifted around where damage comes from for both Elemental and Enhancement. The overall damage should be down a bit, but both specializations should still feel strong. Remember, if you’re giving feedback and making comparisons to other classes and specs, please list who you’re comparing to, as it’s quite possible that you’re feeling underpowered compared to someone who is overpowered.<br />
<br />
The Fire Elementals were stronger than we wanted, so we reduced the amount of spell power that the standard version gets to 40%, down from 55% (Primal: 60%, down from 82.5%). The Primal Elementalist talent was also too strong, so we reduced the damage of the Primal Fire Elemental’s Immolate DoT by 65%. Also on the topic of talents, Elemental Blast was too weak, so we increased its damage and stat effects by roughly 17%, but reduced its proc chance with Echo of the Elements to 6% for Enhancement (previously it had a 30% chance to trigger an Echo for Enhancement, which made that talent pair too strong).<br />
<br />
Further, on the topic of shocks, we recently reduced the shared cooldown of shocks to 5 seconds for Elemental shaman. More recently, we lowered Earth Shock’s damage a bit and significantly increased Flame Shock’s damage.<br />
<br />
Specific to Enhancement, we wanted to bring DPS down a bit and also make them feel like more of their damage was coming from their active buttons, rather than passively. The one significant change that you probably won’t be able to datamine is an increase to Feral Spirits’ damage. They now get 50% of your attack power each, up from 30%. And their Spirit Bite ability’s damage has more than doubled. The net result should be that Feral Spirits are significantly stronger than before, probably somewhere between 70% and 100% stronger, depending on gear.<br />
Enhancement shaman will still take Echo of the Elements though because, comparing it to the other talents on T4 (http://mop.wowhead.com/mists-of-pandaria-talent-calculator#s), it's pretty much mandatory. I can believe that EB combined with EotE would have been too powerful, but disagree with how sharply they nerfed it.<br />
<br />
Speaking of DPS... I wasn't aware we were &quot;overpowered&quot;. Also, just how can Blizzard's solution to our passive damage be to just decrease our physical damage and increase the damage of a 2min CD that should have been buffed at the start of Cataclysm in the first place? If there is such a problem, it's because of our CD-based rotation (if you can call it that). I'm not against such a system, but what are you supposed to do if you're doing everything right and still (depending on circumstances) sometimes ending up doing plain ol' white damage for 3-4 seconds? Hard-cast LB which hits like a wet noodle? Sounds like one of our CD rotation spells (excluding shock spells) could use a reduction on its CD timer -- like 1 or 2 seconds, depending on which spell. (Of course I don't want our spec to be locked down via CDs, either. That'd be just as bad, if not worse.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, at least there's the good news of the 5sec shared CD for shocks becoming baseline for elemental.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alayea</div><div class="date">2012-08-07, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A slightly lengthy post by Ghostcrawler was put up several minutes ago regarding changes to Vengeance. Here you go.<br />
<br />
We changed how Vengeance works.<br />
<br />
Vengeance is intended to let tanks generate additional damage and threat as content levels rise, despite not gearing for it (or at least not primarily). We're changing the design to let Vengeance play better with active mitigation, but the new design has some other advantages many of you will like.<br />
<br />
As most all of you know by now, the idea of active mitigation is that the buttons a tank presses directly contribute to mitigation and survival. In some cases, this is timing-centric, such as Death Strike. In others, it’s both timing-centric and also involves balancing how you spend your resources among multiple abilities, such as Savage Defense vs. Frenzied Regeneration or Shield Block vs. Shield Barrier. In the latter case, it’s important that both abilities are compelling and compete well with each other. We are changing Vengeance to let those abilities be balanced.<br />
<br />
I'm going to use Savage Defense (a short duration large dodge buff) and Frenzied Regen (a large instant heal) as examples. Getting the balance between SD and FR right is challenging. We want SD to win on average, but you’re limited on how often you can use it, and it’s not necessarily reliable -- sometimes you really need a heal NOW, and so FR is the right button. SD should win, but FR shouldn’t be too far behind, and they should scale similarly. <br />
<br />
SD scales with the incoming damage: if BossA hits you for 60k, and BossB hits you for 120k, then SD is twice as valuable (in absolute terms) on BossB than on BossA. FR scales with your attack power: even a few 5man trash mobs will cap out your Vengeance, so your AP will be the same on BossA as on BossB. FR isn’t any stronger on BossB than BossA.<br />
<br />
On top of that, AP and boss damage scales differently as ilevel rises. We tried a solution to that problem where FR scaled exponentially with AP in the last build. That has worked fairly well, but still failed at keeping SD and FR balanced when boss damage was significantly different from the baseline we used as a tuning point. For example, 25-player raid bosses hit twice as hard as 10-player raid bosses, which makes SD twice as valuable.<br />
<br />
But wasn’t this post supposed to be about Vengeance? Currently, Vengeance increases your AP by 5% of the damage taken, stacking up to the cap, which happens quickly. We are changing Vengeance to increase AP equal to 5% of the damage you take for 20 sec. This buff will &quot;roll&quot; so that as it gets refreshed the unused part is added to the new buff, similar to how Ignite or Stagger work. The net result will be that Vengeance stacks by the amount of DPS being thrown at you over 20 sec. There is no cap.<br />
<br />
Additional nuances:<br />
<br />
-- Avoidance will not count against you. Avoiding an attack will extend the current Vengeance stack back to 20 sec (as if you were hit again for the same DPS).<br />
-- Blocks, absorbs, Stagger and Shield of the Righteous will also not count against you. The damage before these effects is used for the Vengeance calculation.<br />
-- To reduce ramp up time, we bump you up to halfway to whatever your average Vengeance level would be based on each individual hit. Essentially, we skip the first 10 sec of ramping.<br />
-- Tank damage in 5-player groups will decrease. We think this is a good chance because it is weird and demoralizing when tanks consistently top damage meters in dungeons.<br />
-- Tank damage in 25-player groups will increase. We think this is a good change because it makes tank DPS as relevant in 25-player raids as it is in 10-player raids.<br />
-- With this change, Brewmaster damage will be extremely overpowered. We will fix it, but you may get a build where they are ludicrously good.<br />
<br />
The rest of this post is nitty gritty details for theorycrafters. You do NOT need to read or understand this in order to effectively play a tank.<br />
<br />
-- Whenever you get hit, Vengeance is added based on the damage of the hit before block, crit block, absorbs, stagger, and Shield of the Righteous.<br />
-- Whenever you avoid an attack from a mob where MobLevel&gt;=TankLevel-3, your existing Vengeance is extended to 20sec remaining.<br />
-- Based on how hard you’re hit, we estimate how high Vengeance’s equilibrium point will be: DamageTaken / 1.5.<br />
-- If you’re not at least half that high on Vengeance, we bump you up to that amount<br />
-- The new Vengeance value is calculated as: 0.05 * DamageTaken + OldVengeance * OldVengeanceSecondsRemaining / 20<br />
-- Frenzied Regeneration and Shield Barrier’s formulae have changed to:<br />
Frenzied Regeneration at 60 rage: max(2*(AP-Agi*2), Sta*2.5)<br />
Shield Barrier at 60 rage: max(2*(AP-Str*2), Sta*2.5)<br />
-- Yes, these do mean that it uses your AP without base AP from Str/Agi (but does still slightly include AP from Agi/Str when you’ve got the 10% AP raid buff or other +%AP buffs).<br />

Yes when comparing your gimp enhancement shaman make sure its none of the classes that can kick your ass(arcane blast x6 mage) in 3 shots. Compare it to that weed you just picked. You totally kicked its ass.</div></div><hr />

Personally i dont mind no auctioneers, i prefer to do my auctioning away from the very crowded areas anyway. Probably keep my auctioning characters in the ah in valley of strength? (one near the arena, not played for a few months). Then the rest of my characters in the new cities near to where the action and vendors are. Plus they look ace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They lowered Invincible and Mimirons head from 100% to 5%, but left both OS drakes 100% so they're kind of weird with their droprates. They make some that were really hard to get easier while leaving others to be RNG nightmares. I'm just wondering if the HRag mount will be lower than the HDW mount since it is going to be in the BMAH too. The dropchance will have to be low or it won't sell for much.</div></div><hr />

It makes perfect sense. Lets say there is a bug (or otherwise unintended thing) happening with survival hunters and they are doing a crapload of dps compared to everyone else. The devs have acknowledged this issue and plan on fixing it... or just it is widely known that in every raid, that survival hunter is always tops of the dps by a wide margin.<br />
<br />
If you are a fire mage.. do not go on the forums and say ´omg, we are so weak.. I am only doing 75% of the damage of a survival hunter´.. It is a meaningless comment because the ´ balance problem´ is with the survival hunter. <br />
<br />
But yeah, it is funny when dumb people call other people dumb because they can´t understand something that makes perfect sense to non-dumb people.</div></div><hr />

You can spin it anyway you want buddy. They are basically saying, if you feel gimp its because your comparing yourself to an op class... Well no fing way genius! What an epiphany!

<br />
In many cases a class is OP due to bugs that have made certain abilities or weapons OP. You don't know what you're talking about. Data helps Blizz to determine the source of the problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not what they're basically saying. Not at all.<br />
<br />
How do you not understand that feedback like comparing your gimped class to a broken class that's doing twice as much damage as all the others is completely useless information to them... And it won't get your class fixed.<br />
<br />
But if you claim that your class is doing significantly less damage than the other average classes that all seem to be balanced within a close percentage to each other,<br />
then that is good feedback that supports your legit claim, and may actually get your class buffed.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: and you're applying a comment he made about 'beta feedback' to 'live realm feedback' because that's obviously not what he meant.</div></div><hr />
