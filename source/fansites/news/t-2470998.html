Patch 8.1.5 PTR - Cycle of Life Tortollan Quest<br />
The PTR has added an interesting new world quest to the Tortollan lineup called the Cycle of Life. <br />
<br />
<br />
It takes place with Scrollsage Nola (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/134344-scrollsage-nola) and can spawn anywhere that the baby turtle quest Beachhead resides.<br />
This quest is very different from helping baby turtles to the water. Upon reaching it, Nola will tell you &quot;These tiny crabs need help! I hate to see any living things suffer. Would you be willing to lend a hand?&quot;<br />
You then take control of a crab and must move left or right in order to block baby turtles from reaching the water whilst avoiding the orb attacks from Scroll of Blasting (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/292149-scroll-of-blasting).<br />
After blocking a baby turtle, its shell will appear on your head and you can use Throw Turtle Shell (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/292287-throw-turtle-shell) to take out any baby turtles in a line up the beach.<br />
The quest ends when you block 20 baby turtles from the water. Nola exclaims &quot;All creatures in nature must live together in balance. But I can't help cheering for the little turtles!&quot;<br />

<br />
But the removal of portals is supposed to encourage player interaction in the world.<br />
<br />
For example, if you want to go farm something in caverns of time, you should stop and have a grog with xxlegolasxx at the inn in ratchet on your way there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Pathetic&quot; As in removing QoL things for farming old world content? What's the idea here, to make more people quit the game? Do you want an empty &quot;huge world&quot; ? I don't know about you, but it's fine to complain when bad changes happens to the game you like.</div></div><hr />

The CoT one I can see for sure as it’s a portal next to many dungeons and a raid. Vale is valid also, yet we still get a portal to Pandaria in a different zone that’s less centered.<br />
But Dalaran Crater? That’s not useful.<br />
Hellfire Penninsula? We have a portal straight to Shat.<br />
Wyrmrest Temple? Jesus I didn’t even know this one existed. Would have been nice I guess but as I’ve never known about it I can’t say I’m going to miss it. Especially after the past 4 years of never going that way anyways.<br />
Karazan? There’s a quest you can complete in 2 run thrus that gives you a ring that ports you to the doors, and a portal to Blasted Lands that is one zone over and roughly 3-5 mins of flight.<br />
This is truly the end of the world...of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What info did you expect? Did you expect him to just read the latest blue post about 8.1.5? This is a video targeted at players that don't read the WoW news it will popup in the launcher and give them the brief info about what to expect. If you want details you already have them in other forms.<br />

<br />
The portals mentioned above are only useful while leveling, when you have to go and get your artifacts for if you want to go to Outland at level 60. CoT is the only usuful one.<br />
<br />
But I would replace Norhtrend Dalaran portal with Wyrmrest Temple and Azsuna with Broken Isles Dalaran. But again it's not a big deal because you get the Dalaran Hearthstone.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps, but remember - this is just one guy making it and all he has in terms of sound is what he can dig up out of W3/WoW. I mean, sure, maybe he could enchance it somewhat, but it is still overall very impressive for what it is :)</div></div><hr />

I play both actually. Never really noticed a huge issue getting around as either side. There’s even people posting guides about how to get around after the change that don’t hinder people as much as it seems.

The GOG-enhanced version offers several quality of life additions, including minor audio fixes, up-scaling support for resolution and refresh rate control, and compatibility fixes. Please note that this version cannot connect to Battle.net and only supports multiplayer via LAN and P2P connection.<br />

<br />
Cheaters were so prevalent because everything was saved on Client-side. :p<br />
<br />
Battle.net exists for it. However it's an ancient version that predates even the WC3/SC1 Battle.net.<br />
<br />
In Diablo 1 it's just basic join/create game features.<br />
<br />
In Warcraft 3/SC1 it's create/join, ladders, custom games and more.<br />
<br />
The current version of Battle.net is just mostly used for authentication and game management along with Real ID. Along with other fluff features.</div></div><hr />
