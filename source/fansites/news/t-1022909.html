Blue Posts - Healing<br />
I might have read this wrong, but I thought they meant that int would no longer increase your mana pool as it does now, but having more spirit would mean more regen, and unless I'm very wrong I don't think it would change anything apart from making spirit more meaningful and making our mana increase come from regen instead of a more static mana pool. For now I'll content myself with believing that this could actually lead to more mana over a fight, and hope I'm not living in a fantasy dreamworld when the reality is that no matter how you gear your performance will never, ever change<br />
Hey all, here's some more information from Ghostcrawler about this topic-<br />
<br />
This is our intent. We aren’t trying to nerf healers across the board, and if we were, there are cleaner ways to do that. What we want to do is make the role of the stats less ambiguous. Currently, when Intellect drives mana pool and Spirit drives mana regen, then they are both longevity stats and interact in complex ways. With the change we are proposing, Intellect provides bigger heals and Spirit improves longevity. For healers, there should not always be a clear cut answer. Intellect may still be the superior stat, but not by as much as it is today. (Again, for healers -- DPS specs aren’t designed to run out of mana if they use their regen mechanics every now and then.) Mana pools can still be large (we are thinking 100,000 mana at level 85) so that it doesn’t feel too bizarre to existing casters and doesn’t feel too much like rage or energy.<br />
<br />
In addition, we think fixed mana pools will help healers scale better with content. Some players seem to be interpreting the 5.0 design as healing 5-player dungeons should be easy but healing raids should be very hard. That is certainly a better situation than dungeons being very hard and raids being easy, but neither is really the goal. We want the increase in difficulty to be linear. If you can handle dungeons, you should be able to graduate to raids with the normal incremental gear improvements that most players get. This is particularly true of normal and Raid Finder difficulty settings. Heroic raiding will remain more challenging, but even in that case, keep in mind that the challenge of a raid encounter is often its complexity, which requires the group to learn and execute a lot of mechanics.<br />
<br />
Gearing up will still be rewarding and meaningful. You’ll still feel as powerful as you do today. Intellect and Sprit will just do different things. If you find yourself routinely running out of mana on raid fights, you are probably either overhealing a lot or the group is taking a lot of damage that is intended to be avoidable. A fight like Phase 2 Beth’tilac on heroic is about as mana-intensive as things get, and that phase doesn’t last very long, so your mana-regen mechanics and cooldowns should be sufficient to keep you going. That won’t change in 5.0.<br />
<br />
This is my wish for healing: Stop changing stuff. Just leave it alone. Back away from the design board. Go work on a new non-combat pet questing system or something. Or come up with someway for people to get raid gear from farming herbs. I absolutely loved my Mage prior to Cata. The constant yo-yo's of which spec is better in Cata drove me crazy and I got tired of it, so I swapped to a paladin so I wouldn't be asked to respec every week depending on which Dev got his way in the nerfs/buffs department that week.<br />
We hear you. Believe me. As we have said a few times lately, we understand that change (even change for the better) isn’t always desired by every player. We also don’t think it’s fair to make players live with problems and these forums are a testament to the number of things players would still like for us to change (which run the gamut from buffs or nerfs to mechanical changes or quality of life problems). The strategy that we are trying lately is to make both sides happy as much as we can and limit mechanical changes during an expansion (unless we think they really, really can’t wait) but use new expansions to fix problems.<br />
<br />
The complexity isn't in the size of the mana pool though, the complexity is in the amount of different regen talents and abilities that work off of either intellect or spirit. If you remove any linking of regen to intellect, then only thing left by way of &quot;regen&quot; would be how much mana you start with at the beginning of the fight which is a drop in the pan when it comes to regen. <br />
There shouldn't be any mana regen mechanics that work based strictly on Intellect. There are several that work based on max mana pool, but that is one of the reasons we want max mana to be fixed. If there are any Intellect-based mechanics I’m not remembering at the moment, we will convert those as well. <br />
<br />
No one liked it, its a flawed system, and the longer they keep propping it up, the more healers that will quit or reroll Dps and Tanks. I enjoyed this expansion's approach to healing a great deal. I guess that makes me no-one. <br />
Yes, designs like this are subjective. There are players who preferred healing in Lich King and players, like some of the game developers, who prefer it in Cataclysm. Our goal is to try to make the game as fun as possible, and we use player feedback to influence those decisions, but as you can see, feedback is often contradictory. We ask you to keep in mind that it’s difficult for anyone on the forums to be able to speak on behalf of the community. It’s fine to state your opinion, but don’t muddy the issue by asserting that “everyone” agrees with you.<br />
<br />
A change like this would be huge and would require a massive reworking of a lot of classes. Things like innervate and divine plea would be significantly devalued since they wouldn't scale not to mention the mastery of Arcane Mages (to use a non-healer example).<br />
It’s actually not that massive a reworking. Innervate and Divine Plea for example already use a % of max mana, so they would stay exactly the same. Innervate is 5 or 15% of max mana and Divine Plea is 12% of max mana. Arcane would actually benefit from the change, because currently the spec is harder to play when mana pools are low and has too easy a time cranking out huge numbers when mana pools are high, which makes it hard for other mage specs to keep up in later tiers without constant tweaking.<br />
<br />
Honestly, we don’t think a lot of players will even notice the change unless they are really in tune with how much mana their character has. A lot of players learn that say Greater Heal takes up a chunk of their bar of X length and they have an idea on how many more heals they can cast before they run OOM. In other words, they already think in terms of bar length and percentage, not absolute number. The biggest differences will be that your mana bar won’t grow from 100,000 in 4.0 to 120,000 in 4.2 and mana-pool-based regen mechanics won’t grow more and more dominant over Spirit-based regen mechanics as your gear improves (and we can certainly boost Spirit-based regeneration if needed so that healers don’t feel nerfed).<br />
<br />
I would point out the shaman's talent Telluric Currents. This talent scales mana regen with damage done. Since Int increases damage done, this talent allows more regen for better stats. With low end gear the mana regen can be negative since the cost of the spell outweighs the mana regenerated. With high end gear the opp set can be true.<br />
Yes, good catch. That is an example of an Intellect-scaling regen mechanic. It would be easy to convert it to something like the paladin mechanic of Judgement granting X% of your total mana.<br />
<br />
Complex for you to balance or complex for players to understand? I don't I can believe any player has a hard time getting what intellect or what spirit does now.<br />
Well, both ultimately, but we meant the latter. Players probably understand generally that Intellect increases spell power, mana pool and crit. What is harder to understand is that Spirit is a good regen stat up to a point and depending on your class, but that Intellect “double dips” because it makes your heals larger and increases the benefit of non-Spirit based regen, such as Divine Plea, and at a certain point, Intellect as a regen stat is more powerful than Spirit as a regen stat. It’s not exactly rocket surgery, but we’re not sure we get a lot of interesting design space out of it. Several players have pointed out that we could make all regeneration mechanics work off of Spirit, and that would be another way to go, but we thought that required even more change. Consider for example that non-healers often have no Spirit but still need to benefit from Divine Plea.<br />
<br />
My main concern is that while addressing their goals... they completely let the idea of what is fun for a healer fly right over their heads.<br />
Not at all. “What is fun” is our primary concern. As I pointed out above however, players rarely agree on what is fun and are often on completely opposite sides. If everyone agreed, our jobs would be easy. (And don’t mistake a few dozen or even hundred passionate posts as consensus on anything.)<br />
<br />
We don’t think ignoring a resource is fun. For healers, it would just mean using your most powerful spell in every situation, because there is no reason not to do so. Once you aren’t making decisions on the fly, you’re just going through encounter robotically, which doesn’t sound too engaging. On the flip side, content being brutally difficult might not be fun either (though we know it is for at least a small percentage of our players) so we want to make sure you aren’t overly punished for mistakes and make sure mana isn’t so precious that you are spending lots of time idle. As I also said above, we think this change will be smaller than some of you appear to be thinking, which is why I am spending so much effort to try and assuage your concerns.<br />

<br />
It doesn't. 32 bit just has hard caps (esp. on RAM usage), 64 bit has caps that are unreachable for anything we can think off now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daegalus</div><div class="date">2011-11-16, 05:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why does running WoW on 32 bit with my 64 bit version of windows 7 make the performance worse? Just curious. Thanks for the help.<br />
<br />
Because it is being emulated. THe performance degrade is minor, but its there because the system has to do extra work to handle 32bit while running 64bit. Second, in cases of games, there tends to be miscommunciation between the 32bit parts and the 64bit parts. A 64bit app on 64bit os has better control of its memory and is allowed to go over the 2 gig of memory cap that 32bit processes have. THe primary issue most people on higher end systems have is memory.<br />
<br />
An example from personal experience. I have 12 gigs of ram. I am running a 64-bit win7. When WoW asks the system for more ram, the OS sees that I have 12 gigs of ram, and the process is only using say 1.9 gigs, so the os says we have more and gives it more. WoW tries to start using it. And goes over the 2 gig cap. The 32-bit limit is hit, and denies WoW that extra memory and the game crashes.<br />
<br />
A temporary fix was enabling a special flag in the WoW.exe (modifying the exe every patch and risking getting banned by warden for modifying it, but I dont know anyone that got banned) which allows 32bit processes to read more than 2 gigs of ram. It immediately solved the issue.<br />
<br />
Anyways, its more of a compatibility problem. 32bit on 64bit os is not ideal and when using large amounts of memory and heavy resource usage can allow the very tiny insignificant compatibility problems to be exasperated.<br />
<br />

<br />
just to clarify, wow may be 32 bit, but 4.0 and higher can address 3.5 gigs of memory not 2.0 gigs. They enabled the special flag because 3.3.5 (the last 3.x version) crashed a TON from out of memory errors. it's not magic that 4.0 suddenly stopped crashing from that.<br />
that said 3.5 is not going to be enough for ultra in 5.0 when they vastly increase farclip (view distance) and add in the new shadows and physics rendering/blending they discussed at blizzcon. Plus all intel chips since late 2006 early 2007 are 64 bit anyways so with the release of 5.0 it's pretty safe to say 32 bit is on it's way out the door.<br />
<br />
It is important to note that the SAME instruction on 64 bit vs 32 bit will require more memory. JUST opening wow in 64 bit mode will increase it's memory footprint. So take note of that. If you're on a 64 bit system but only have 2-4 gigs of ram, launching in 64 bit mode could actually DEGRADE your performance vs launching in 32 bit mode for apps that support dual mode, depending on free memory situation and VM pageouts. So these new client features are a bettering for some but misused will make things worse if you don't understand them.</div></div><hr />

Well yes, but I was trying to keep it quick. Plus I did my initial stuff back about 1.5 years ago, haven't been paying attention since. I had taken a long break from WoW at that time, so I wasn't paying attention when I came back for Cata.<br />
<br />
I also know about this too, but at the time, it was just so frustrating, ANYTHING would have been better. Yes it could have made it worse for some, but in hte grand scheme it would fix a lot. But thanks for filling in the blanks for others, I kinda wanted to get the gist of hte response in there.</div></div><hr />

There shouldn't be any mana regen mechanics that work based strictly on Intellect. There are several that work based on max mana pool did he forget that Intellect at the moment makes your max mana pool larger?<br />
<br />
So mana regen based around max mana pool is in fact working directly from Intellect and if they remove that then trinket, item choice, and enchants for healers goes out the window. As it stands now anything with +int proc, use, or even flat int provides us with an option to use it for regen or for throughput this gives us the ability to have more say in how our class performs and more variety in how we choose to play.<br />
<br />
So imo this change is a flat dumming down of healing mechanics, it's too early to say if it will be fun or not but for me less choice equals less fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So mana regen based around max mana pool is in fact working directly from Intellect and if they remove that then trinket, item choice, and enchants for healers goes out the window. As it stands now anything with +int proc, use, or even flat int provides us with an option to use it for regen or for throughput this gives us the ability to have more say in how our class performs and more variety in how we choose to play.<br />
<br />
So imo this change is a flat dumming down of healing mechanics, it's too early to say if it will be fun or not but for me less choice equals less fun.<br />

Huh?! What's your problem here? That you can't run out of a void in 2secs? Seriously in every FL- raidencounter I have seen (6/7HC) you always have more than enough time to gett your virtual butt out off bad stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
An example from personal experience. I have 12 gigs of ram. I am running a 64-bit win7. When WoW asks the system for more ram, the OS sees that I have 12 gigs of ram, and the process is only using say 1.9 gigs, so the os says we have more and gives it more. WoW tries to start using it. And goes over the 2 gig cap. The 32-bit limit is hit, and denies WoW that extra memory and the game crashes.<br />
<br />
Serious question: How do you get your WoW to use more that 1 Gig of RAM? Mine stays as ~900MB used RAM no matter what I do. (Settings Ultra-shadows; System E6600/Win7 x64pro/4Gig RAM)</div></div><hr />

Do yourself a favor and turn off hyperthreading. It can even degrade the performance when it comes to gaming...<br />

Even in the best case scenario like compiling stuff, you will only get max 10% out of those 2 &quot;extra cores&quot;.<br />

Also, if you want to overclock, hyperthreading adds almost 10 degrees sometimes at the same voltage and overclock on an i7. I turned it off to get a 4.2 on air. I think with gaming and some multitasking that the boost in processor speed is much much better than the extra cores.</div></div><hr />

Depends on the CPU and the Game you are running.<br />
<br />
On a 2 core cpu the extra cores will help but so will OCing although the extra cores would be way more beneficial.<br />
On a 4 core cpu the extra cores wont matter as much as the frequency.</div></div><hr />

The game client is already large address aware and is able to utilize up to 4 GB of address space. Without the LAA flag a 32-bit application is limited to 2 GB, but double that and you shouldn't have any problems. Extra stability simply will not come from the inclusion of an x64 executable, although there's always room for a possible performance boost. It's hard to say what kind of boosts such an upgrade would bring, but chances are that they would be measurable at the very least. It's difficult to say whether or not there would be a notable increase, though.<br />

Oh, and for those of you that didn't know large address aware was added to WoW: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1658706617?page=8#145 It was stealthily done back in 4.1 and not everyone caught on. The 2 GB cap only exists on 32-bit operating systems now, and while there are a few ways around it there, the one advisable workaround is to simply bump up to a 64-bit OS.</div></div><hr />

Not trying to be insulting here but do you still play wow ? Have you seen the current Launcher lately ? Do you use the Launcher at all ?<br />

Because :http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2978624/4.2.2.14545.jpg<br />
<br />
It's an option in the current live Launcher as well. Been there since the 9th November 2609 tools patch actually. This option isn't there in the 2552 version of the tools and not in the ones I've kept archives of.<br />
<br />
I've also done a strings search on the PTR binary as well as extracted the Interface code from the PTR as well. Nothing else other then what was found last time.<br />

This is going to sound elitist, but I don't know how else to phrase it.<br />
<br />
Lightwell is the strongest heal in the game. It's absolutely amazing and GOOD raiders use it. If you think it's a bad ability, then you do not know how to play this game. It's amazingly strong, it's unique to other heals, and it's interactive.<br />
On a healing intensive phase like Beth's burn phase at the end, when MASSIVE raid damage is going out. You toss a lightwell down, everyone clicks on it just once, and watch as your raid receives MASSIVE amounts of healing almost singlehandedly saving the raid.<br />
What could possibly make that a bad ability other than your raiders not using it?</div></div><hr />

How about to make healing so taxing that we would feel forced to stick to our assignments, making assigments interesting once again, and the less overhealing we are doing, the more effective we can be, and actually have a hard decision if you have enough mana to help another healer with his assignment, instead of simply sniping his heal? Come back TBC and Vanilla. I consider that not even half of the things that make healing fun matter in a world where mana doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadanon</div><div class="date">2011-11-16, 03:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Few words about the healing changes to a locked down max mana. It has to do with character progression. Mana is essential part of any healing class and having more of it is better. Thats why Int is very important as of now. <br />
<br />
Blizzard themselfs changed Int and removed spellpower in Cataclysm. Thats how they lost a way to balance power versus mana pool. And they nerfed regen features so that at times it was very hard to run any raids without shamans spaming regen for the entire raid. <br />
<br />
But here is what it all comes down to. The ENTIRE content of the game is controlled by healing. That is the single feature that determines the difficulty of a fight. So.. the more control BLizzard has of controlling healing - the more drawn out they can make the content since it is no longer based as much on gear as before. This is what BLizzard has been doing for the past few years. Control more and more and remove more and more in terms of stats from the players. We all know whos behind it cause GC wants to have 150% control on everything regarding class balance. <br />
<br />
But the real issue that ALWAYS has been the big issue has to do with PVP versus PVE. Thats the feature that NEEDS to be changed so one is not effecting the other so much. The current talent system is not giving ppl any real choises of anything. As soon as you pick a spec you are bound to do things one way. 6 stat system will be even worse because in truth every spec can only pick one of these features as usefull at all - And in many cases (SPECIALLY FOR HEALERS) there are whole tiers of talents that have zero use for a healing class). <br />
<br />
You can say its easier to balance things when you take every aspect of choise from a player. Thats what has been happening over the past few years and mose players that have tried other games lately (RIFT for example) can see that those games are going exactly the oposite direction. More freedom - even spells based on the weapon you are holding like in GW2. These games are the future. WOW on the other hand is locked down by GhostCrawler to be deemed as the &quot;balanced&quot; game doomed to have zero real choises for players. These mana changes are just one more feature in that crusade. And its killing the game as a RPG game with meaningfull choises.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go play LOTRO. The answer to your problem is not healer management, but group management. If there are people who can contribute in a group to the damage being done to group members, if there are people who can support your healing, if there are people, who in turn can be supported by YOU, and if there is a true resources management - not only personal one, but also in the group as such - then you will get encounters, which are satisfying. In WoW, there are group buffs. Period. From there, everyone fights for himself. Yes, there is some interaction, but it's way too low. <br />
<br />
My conclusion is: in WoW, I do not want to be dependant on others to fulfil my role. And where mana is too much an issue - then I am dependant on others. When healers have little to no self-sustaining mana-regen options they can use more than once in an encounter, the game is not fun anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healing is based on gear. Thats the issue here and has always been the case. WOTLK was easy because the gear was too good compared to the content. And this just became more aparent when the raiding ppl got better and better gear. <br />
<br />
At the same time the more casual players were still forced to fight in worse gear making the &quot;less&quot; challenging content like 5 mans still be worth the effort. But then the more hardcore ppl whined and whined for months and BLizzard created Cataclysm with so steep rise between Normals and heroic 5 man dungeons that alot of the more casual players left and Blizzard lost valuable money to make content for the more hardcore.<br />
<br />
You can not have it both ways. The entire issue comes not because of stats. It comes because the content is not flexible enough based on the gear ppl are wearing - or the classes that enter each dungeon. Thats the issue that needs to be looked at and other games have been doing. GWs will have a system based on how many are taking part for example. <br />
<br />
We have heard about the challenge dungeons during last BLizzcon. But when you listen to what BLizzard actually said about them... you realise that they have in fact not desided upon anything how it is gonna scale. PPL in high enough gear will still be able to do this content while ppl in lower gear does not have a chance since their stats do not scale at all. Well... thats the only thing you could read out of it from a confused BLizzard devs not even understanding what they were saying themselfs.</div></div><hr />

Lightwell is the strongest heal in the game. It's absolutely amazing and GOOD raiders use it. If you think it's a bad ability, then you do not know how to play this game. It's amazingly strong, it's unique to other heals, and it's interactive.<br />
On a healing intensive phase like Beth's burn phase at the end, when MASSIVE raid damage is going out. You toss a lightwell down, everyone clicks on it just once, and watch as your raid receives MASSIVE amounts of healing almost singlehandedly saving the raid.<br />
What could possibly make that a bad ability other than your raiders not using it?<br />
<br />
Priests have a special assignment for Beth:<br />
<br />
- Be DISC<br />
- Go kill poopers that spawn at sides<br />
- profit</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">F-Minus</div><div class="date">2011-11-16, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healing is based on gear. Thats the issue here and has always been the case. WOTLK was easy because the gear was too good compared to the content. And this just became more aparent when the raiding ppl got better and better gear. <br />
<br />
At the same time the more casual players were still forced to fight in worse gear making the &quot;less&quot; challenging content like 5 mans still be worth the effort. But then the more hardcore ppl whined and whined for months and BLizzard created Cataclysm with so steep rise between Normals and heroic 5 man dungeons that alot of the more casual players left and Blizzard lost valuable money to make content for the more hardcore.<br />
<br />
You can not have it both ways. The entire issue comes not because of stats. It comes because the content is not flexible enough based on the gear ppl are wearing - or the classes that enter each dungeon. Thats the issue that needs to be looked at and other games have been doing. GWs will have a system based on how many are taking part for example. <br />
<br />
We have heard about the challenge dungeons during last BLizzcon. But when you listen to what BLizzard actually said about them... you realise that they have in fact not desided upon anything how it is gonna scale. PPL in high enough gear will still be able to do this content while ppl in lower gear does not have a chance since their stats do not scale at all. Well... thats the only thing you could read out of it from a confused BLizzard devs not even understanding what they were saying themselfs.<br />
<br />
It's a problem all classes are facing, yet they somehow manage to pull 180 changes on healers every single expansion. I hate it. I've been a healer since vanilla and I'm pretty tired re-learning healing every expansion and it's consequential patches. That said, healers out of all scale the worst with gear, yet we seem to have a bullseye painted on our heads, since we get changed/nerfed every expansion, while the DPS/Tanks get a pass. <br />
<br />
I don't know playing my mage vs. my priest the game is completely different. As a mage, I stand there spam 2-3 buttons and occasionally move from some dangers or stack. That's all I have to worry about, yet my DPS increases significantly with better gear. Where's if I play my healer, I have to worry about 10-25 bars next to all the shit on the ground and predict damage output of the boss on the tank, keep track of magic/disease debuffs and all that kind of shit, yet my healing doesn't scale half as much as the damage of the DPS. <br />
<br />
It's just stressful and to a degree I like it, that's why I rolled a healer, to master situations, but sometimes it's just too much. And if you manage to get a bit better after one expansion, the developer thinks you're too good and are right there with a nerf bat. <br />
<br />
Start Cataclysm, I felt like shit as a Holy Priest trying to run heroics. I oom-d at bosses when their health was around 60%. I don't wanna go through that scrap again, it's not fun, it's way to stressful. Sometimes I also want to stand in place and cast heals without having to worry about resources, like most DPS do. <br />

<br />
So far this expansion we got redesigned tanking, skill trees and healing. And as we are ending the expansion they are talking about redesigning all 3 again.<br />
<br />
I personally am getting a little tired of the constant changes that I don't feel need to be made. There are bigger issues with this game than the state of healing currently.<br />
<br />
In a loot related game I think its bad design when they cant design the game around the stat increases they gave us on gear. Like cant they make a generic piece of gear with certain item levels/stats on it to see oh damn, by the time these guys are in 403 gear these % of total mana regen talents/buffs are going to be so high that you cant really burn your mana fast enough on a fight based on how expensive we made spells.<br />
<br />
But its typical of the devs of this game. Chill of the Throne, Sunwell Radiance, Stat Squish all a bandaid to the fact that they dont project out the gear to see where it goes and then when the outcome isnt what they want they throw the baby out with the bath water and start again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Multi-GPU support is added in through drivers and profiles these days. It relies more on Nvidia and AMD to get it working than it does on the game developer. WoW does in fact scale quite nicely with extra graphics chips, assuming you're not CPU-bound. I've done some benchmarking myself, and if you're interested in seeing the performance differences feel free to check it out here:<br />

I'm sure it's intentional. This phrase is not terribly uncommon and yes, it's a play on &quot;brain surgery&quot; and &quot;rocket science.&quot;<br />
<br />

There never was, not a single application that went from 32bit to 64bit didn't have noticeable performance gain, at least for me. Adobe products, IE, you name it, still runs the same. Actually iTunes went from shit to shittier, but that's expected from Apple :D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with holy has the same problem with restro druids, they lack of a raid damage reduction cooldown; while Disc has barrier, paladin has aura mastery and shaman has spirit link.<br />
<br />
Heoric Beth and rhyoth can 1 shot everyone when they are near dead before nerf, which is tranq and divine hymn cannot avoid, the only solution is setting up a damage reduction cooldown rotation to counter it.<br />
<br />
TL/DR,<br />
This is not pain suppression vs guardian spirit, barrier simply have superiority againest 1 shots.<br />
Remember this: http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/talents_priest.jpg ?<br />
They should really make barrier (or maybe lightwell as well) into a talent.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cerbul</div><div class="date">2011-11-17, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets be honest. I can do understand class changes, more of them every expansion, and just a few between tiers. I would have tried a different healer class if it didn't change at all.When it comes to healing philosophy in general, then it all goes down to a few choices, where mana matters or not is one of them. Mana was given through intellect that goes up with every upgrade you get? That is all fine in blizzard plan, as they add more damage with every tier. Seems like they have problems balancing it though. Since an encounter should be around 7-10 minutes when you are progressing on it, keeping it the same for all 3 tiers, the incoming damage has to scale with gear. So to burn the mana you get through intellect, you will need to heal more, to have the same mana feeling on a fight that is 7 minutes long, on all 3-4 tiers of an expansion.Here comes the good part. Blizz removes it again, and is all cool, cause honestly I want big incoming damage in first tier of an expansion too, as I don't want to be bored. So this proved to be a bad idea for Cataclysm from Blizzard. Not to mention that they want casuals to experience the content, and they had to nerf really bad the normal modes, to allow those healers to actually be able to see Ragnaros. Now the truth is that this change is a very good change, to be able to balance the game, and obviously, the undergeared players will heal for less, but will use the same amount of mana, making it viable to keep the fight length the same for both undergeared and overgeared players. This seems to be the best change ever, since it allows for more exact balance. Now blizzard isn't afraid to add more incoming damage, since also the undergeared players will have the mana for it, just like an overgeared player. But the real question is, is this the only reason? Are blizzard actually gonna make mana matter again?I am really not even trying anymore to understand how some players actually do enjoy fighting for who heals more/who steals more heals, instead of being in a situation where you save ppl from dying in the cheapest way possible/mostr efficient, so that you have mana for later. I think it defeats the entire reason for being a healer. Anyway, the most benefit that comes from this change, is that we will see fun to heal bosses in the first tiers of an expansion, and not something that hits once every 30 seconds and you heal it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100% agree. Blizzard control difficulty on their content 90% based on healing. So its in their best intrest to make healing as hard as possible to increase the longtivety of the game. And thats what BLizzard is trying to draw out even more now with less content per expansion. Still tanking is the least intresting role - mainly because BLizzard has not created a fully supported game for tanks. There is no Arena for tanks - there is a low tank ratio per raid and so on. Thats the problem they have not adressed and game is suffering for it.<br />
<br />
Healing was not intresting in WOTLK but its not any more intresting in Cata. Blizzard has thrown out toon of dmg and its simply more and more stressfull to play healer and then we are back to healers burning out much faster than any other class.<br />
<br />
What Im truely against is to see such HUGE changes on specs in middle of expansion. BLizzard is nerfing holy palas to hell in 4.3 and changing the core aoe ability for the spec. Holy palas are reliving SUnwell in next patch. Reason beeing that BLizzard wants Shamans to become even more populare class and best way to do so is to nerf Palas to the ground. Cause they are not gonna touch Druids... They are fine with them dominating raids - beeing able to have full druid healing group with zero problems at all.</div></div><hr />

Hooray for 64-bit client! No reason to think it would require a re-install. WoW has very few 32-bit executable files... it's primarily lots of large data files... which won't change. No real reason the Launcher, Background Downloader, Repair Tool, etc would need to be 64-bit... which really only leaves wow.exe and a couple dlls at most, which is well within the ability of the Launcher to push out the 15 megs or so for that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There not really redesigning Healers though there just making one stat more useful, it works almost the exact way it does now. I think people are thinking way to much into this one. <br />
The only thing that will happen is you'll stack more spirit, which is the way it should be you shouldn't have limitless resources in any class/spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
I personally am getting a little tired of the constant changes that I don't feel need to be made. There are bigger issues with this game than the state of healing currently.<br />
<br />
Roll a Resto druid, if you think healing is not broken, go have a look. All you do is stack Int someone put a example of innervate, go look at Revitalize/replen that's the op talent, scales with your max mana pool.<br />
The more int you have the more mana you have the less likely you are to actually go oom and if for some reason you happen to go oom just pop innervate and oh look im 75% full again.<br />
<br />
You know somethings broken when you have normal firelands gear and spirit is pretty much useless, like you reforge as much as you can off cause its wasted stats when you never oom anyway, when your own regen talents (Innervate) almost never get used.<br />
You could see this was broken in the very first tier of cata.<br />
<br />
Bottom line its sort of the same way it is now except you have to balance another stat (Spirit) instead of just reforging it off.<br />
It actually works better than it currently does for fresh 85's, in you wont struggle to heal heroics cause you oom after 3 casts. If you do you just need more spirit until you get better gear, instead of needing that better gear to do the heroics for gear.</div></div><hr />
