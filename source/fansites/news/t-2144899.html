Raid Preview - The Nighthold<br />
The journey through Suramar has been fraught with intrigue and danger as the heroes of Azeroth have fought to help reclaim this shining city. It’s time to take the next step and face the challenges within the Nighthold.<br />
<br />
Minimum Level: 110<br />
Location: Suramar<br />
Bosses: 10<br />
<br />
The largest structure in the Broken Isles and among the grandest in all of Azeroth, the Nighthold stands as a testament to the achievements of the nightborne civilization. Centered around the Nightwell, the fount of arcane power that has sustained Suramar for centuries, these grounds were built as a haven from the worries of the world. But as a felstorm churns above the former temple of Elune across the bay, and Gul’dan himself now resides within the palace’s walls, those worries now begin—not end—here.<br />
<br />
Developer Insights: Even though Gul’dan awaits atop the main spire of the Nighthold, and even though mighty Legion adversaries like Tichondrius and Krosus lurk within the walls of the compound, the Nighthold is not a traditional demonic raid. It stands as a testament to perhaps the greatest civilization Azeroth has ever seen: the pinnacle of elven magic and sophistication.<br />
<br />
Just as our artists and designers approached the creation of the city of Suramar with the aim of evoking the feel and bustle of a living city under occupation, the dungeon team wanted to make sure the Nighthold really felt like the grand palace of Suramar. From botanical gardens to guest quarters, from an observatory to chambers enclosing the power source of nightborne civilization, we tried to build a grand royal court and then consider how the Legion’s presence would affect and transform that foundation. Many of our raid zones are dark and oppressive places, by necessity—the domain of Xavius cannot be bright and cheery—but the Nighthold offers a raid environment that is both beautiful and deadly.<br />
<br />

The Nightwell<br />

<br />
Skorpyron: Deep within the foundations of the Nighthold, beneath the sea, lie long-forgotten vaults that give access to the Nightwell itself. This monstrous armored scorpid has made its home in one of these vaults. Infused with the power of the Nightwell and surrounded by a teeming brood, Skorpyron presents a serious complication to an otherwise promising back entry to the Nighthold.<br />

<br />
Chronomatic Anomaly: As the power to fuel an entire civilization courses from the earth, the cavern at the base of the Nightwell has become a maelstrom of raw energy. Born from this chaotic flux, the Chronomatic Anomaly is an embodiment of the power of the Eye of Aman’thul. As it lashes out with energy attacks, the bursts of energy warp the very flow of time.<br />

<br />
Trilliax: Trilliax, once proud servant to the nightborne aristocracy, has been discarded and left to slowly deteriorate. While an unwavering will to carry out its tasks remains, the passage of time has splintered this construct’s personality matrix. It now unpredictably switches from one mode to the next, ranging from doting caretaker to homicidal sterilizer, craving recognition and validation from a master that no longer exists.<br />

<br />
Spellblade Aluriel: Aluriel always had an affinity for magic. She rose through the ranks of the Nightguard effortlessly, having a natural talent with the sword. But no matter how strong she became, she wanted more. She studied with the mages at the University of Suramar, spending her days in combat training and her evenings in the artificery. She forged her weapons and armor in the Nightwell, weaving magic spells into the precious metals. She is the first Spellblade, adept in the schools of Fire, Frost, and Arcane.<br />

<br />
Krosus: This colossal doom lord, one of the largest and mightiest creatures in the armies of the Legion, was defeated at the Broken Shore through the combined might of the greatest heroes of the Horde and the Alliance. Having recovered from his wounds, Krosus emerges from the bay between the Nighthold and the Tomb of Sargeras to crush anyone who would oppose the Legion.<br />

<br />
High Botanist Tel’arn: From his youth, the nightborne Tel’arn was fascinated by plant life: the resilience and adaptability of weeds, the ability of simple grass to harness the power of the sun, the way a tree may be divided into two, or two branches grafted into one. Aided by the energies of the Nightwell, he has transformed himself to the point that he is scarcely recognizable as a nightborne elf. He now considers himself something far, far greater.<br />

Tichondrius: The dreadlord Tichondrius, once leader of the nathrezim, was slain by the newly awakened power of none other than Illidan Stormrage. Reconstituted in the Twisting Nether, Tichondrius returns to watch over Gul’dan on behalf of the Legion, ensuring that the orc warlock does not once again fail his masters.<br />

Star Augur Etraeus: The nightborne astromancer Etraeus has devoted long years of research to scouring the skies of Azeroth, seeking answers to the great mysteries of the universe. His scrying has shown him worlds beyond our ken, and the power of the Nightwell allows him to draw upon the essence of those worlds to amplify his own powers.<br />

Grand Magistrix Elisande: Elisande once distinguished herself by resisting the Legion. She and her highborne followers broke away from Queen Azshara and the dark path she was taking, harnessing the power of the Eye of Aman’Thul to create the Nightwell, protecting Suramar from the Sundering. But over ten thousand years later, the Legion’s arrival offered her no such recourse. She has cast her lot with the demons, hoping to once again use the power of the Nightwell—this time in a very different sense—to save her people.<br />

Gul’dan: The chain of events set in motion when Garrosh escaped to Draenor has continued, unbroken for all its twists and turns, leading to this very moment. Thwarted in Draenor, Gul’dan now stands on the precipice of achieving ultimate victory on behalf of his Legion masters. Standing atop the Nighthold, as the vortex of fel energy swirls in the skies overhead, the outcast orc warlock awaits his destiny.</div></div><hr />

How can i get more loot from this?<br />
Do i have to enter a second time or do i have to wait 24h or something?<br />
<br />
Could be a daily cooldown on loot. <br />

The difference is there's an achievement for starting the event in Diablo at level 1 and you can up the difficulty to make it a challenge</div></div><hr />

There's an item in the list that allows you to combine 10 scrolls of Town POrtal into a Tome of Town Portal. (EDIT: Item is called Blank Diabolic Tome)<br />
<br />
<br />
I killed the goblin and enetered the Secret Cow level and killed the Cow King and the loot from both those was (among other things) 4 scrolls of Town Portal and the item to combine them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I *think* you also get the Twelve String Guitar toy as a guaranteed first time kill drop from the Cow King, cause it was learning that item that gave me the 20th Anniversary FoS. I doubt Blizz would put that FoS behind something that not everyone could get.</div></div><hr />

Loot the Goblins and the Cow King. <br />
Get 10x Scroll of Town Portal and 1x Blank Diabolic Tome to combine and make the Hearthstone toy.<br />
You can only loot the Cow King once a day, just like world events, but you can kill the Goblins over and over to farm for the scrolls.<br />
(currently farming in the sewers with 1 spawn every 5 minutes).</div></div><hr />

You are wrong I did this with my priest 101 ilvl. Mobs inside were 100lvl, when I have enter inside.<br />

Still there is one problem :P I got instantly killed by ret paladin 110 ilvl :D<br />

As for the model show in the post, that was the goblin back in the Beta test we could find in Dalaran sometimes (never had chance to kill it QQ), but on live they are using the model of the Diablo Treasure Goblin pet (awarded to players who also purchased the Collector's Edition of Reaper of Souls)</div></div><hr />

And how will you lure new players then? Did you even try trial? There's just bunch of quests, 1 or 2 dungeons and... (30 sec dramatic pause)... nothing else! Do you think new players would like this game if they can't experience even miniscule portion of real fun things?</div></div><hr />

Tomb of Sargeras (7.2?) and Argus (7.3) should both have increasing Legion presence.<br />
<br />
They are too afraid to alienate people who get bored of the same theme / enemy type.<br />
<br />
I distinctly remember on 6.2 (Hellfire Citadel / Tanaan Patch), they specifically changed plans and made it about Gul'dan and Legion presence because some people were &quot;tired of orcs&quot;, and even then people were already complaining when they announced Legion (or even before?) because they were tired of demons and green.</div></div><hr />

And this is the right way. Do you want fight only with demons every tier? Nighthold have 3 demon bosses (Tichondrius, Krosus, Guldan), Tomb around 4 (or 5? I don't think we know what 9th boss will be) + demon only mini-zone + demon dungeon. So Legion have already big presence before Argus. At least demons are more diverse than orcs.<br />

Well when i first tried Final Fantasy XIV with a trial account it was right in the middle of the first year annivesary celebration. Each and every content of the event was doable on a trial account. And I loved them all. And it convinced me to play the game. By the way thanks to the extreme ability pruning 1-20 is pretty horrible now. 2 button rotations, empty levels where you don't get skills for leveling up or useful gear for doing quests.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but the first 20 levels are really not a good representation of the game. Considering they are scaling holiday events I see no issue with letting starter editions partake in them.<br />

How's my post related to class trials? JFYI class trials only available for Legion accounts. But if account is flagged for legion there's no problem to buy token and play.

show me any other MMO which have this kind of Trial ? oh ya there is none ... why should a new player care for events when he literally doesn't even know how to play or what the actual fuck Broken Shore is .. i believe a new player has other things to figure out than participate in *mostly* boring events which are done in 15 minutes</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are not talking about that though. We are talking about the appeal of a trial to get a player interested in the game. Also as stated above the FF14 trial allows you to unlock your job and freely participate in events. <br />
<br />
Also how will a new player figure anything out other than how to mash 2 buttons and do some of the piss easiest dungeons with 20 levels? I see no issues with Blizzard loosening up the starter restrictions.</div></div><hr />

Didn't say it was or wasn't, just stated it for what it is.<br />

Personally with Legion I do agree it's overall the right way to go, and it does make sense. Although personally there's a big momentum/pacing clash with Legion from the pre-xpac event to the actual expansion.<br />

It goes from a full-blown nearly world-wide invasion with demons and demon ships falling from the sky and endagering some of our main hubs in Azeroth, and an epic encounter on the Broken Shore where we have to retreat to then discovering that no, they're not &quot;really&quot; here yet, only very few, and we're actually still in time to stop them from arriving them, we just have to fight pretty much un-related enemies that became their allies/servants.<br />
<br />
I get it, lore-wise it makes sense (the &quot;invasions&quot; were a distraction so they could get a foothold in the Broken Isles), but actually playing through it the invasions had a bigger sense of danger and activity than we current have in most of the Broken Isles, personally. In-game it feels a bit disconnected and weird pacing (although that's mostly a flaw on execution, not on the philosophy of varied enemies).<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, I understand they want to make this, and for many players it does feel better, looking back they pretty much always did. I just don't think it justifies breaking the story like 6.2. WoD was already messy, but the worst part was we barely even got the good parts it was supposed to give (story and interaction with the so-called Warlords), and 6.2 only made it worse and pretty much ridiculous from a story and immersion point of view.<br />
<br />
<br />
This trend of theme switches near the end of the expansion to introduce the next one (Garrosh becoming the big bad in MoP leading to WoD, Gul'dan and the Legion becoming the big bad in WoD leading to Legion) does somewhat work in making new expansions feel less &quot;random&quot;, but it also has great potential (mostly in WoD, to be seen with Legion) to remove character from the expansion as a whole and make the final raid a bit underwhelming thematically and lore-wise.</div></div><hr />

as a side note as an old d2 player, the charms are one hell of a flashback to the days of inventory management i'm guessing they are only useful while the event is active..</div></div><hr />

I don't think it will be case this time. For me MoP-WoD-Legion feels like trilogy about last Legion invasion on Azeroth, that's why they are all connected. Of course Blizz screw big time with Warlords story, it should really be more about Wrathion (he tried to bring united force that could defeat Legion to Azeroth, instead only Guldan came through the portal and started the invasion) and Kairoz (I was really hoping for Infinite Dragonflight origin). So anyway, Legion feels like last part in this story, I think that last big patch will be only about Argus and Legion, but we may get bridge patch between 7.3.5 and 8.0 - &quot;medium&quot; size 7.4 with dungeon and/or 1 boss raid that would be Old God/Naga/Pirate/whatever theme.<br />
<br />
I really hope that next expansions will also be trilogy, imagine that:<br />
<br />
1) Old God expansion, start like Pandaria, but on the South Seas, many years after defeating Legion in lore, so our hero will be old lorewise and someone will ask him to go back from retirement ;P, playable Naga or Vrykul/Ogre, tiers: <br />
a)Zandalar+small pirate raid like Trial of Valor<br />
b)Kul'tiras with crazy Jaina (and Kul'tiras like Suramar) - I think raid with humans that worship Old Gods could be amazing<br />
c)Nazjatar - Azshara (duh)<br />
d)Nylotha with N'zoth<br />
<br />
2) Scourge expansion, where we end Sylvanas arc, leveling in the area north of Stratholme, later we will go to Old Kingdom and reveal some stuff about Void Lords<br />
a) Necromancer class<br />
b) Stratholme as neutral capital<br />
<br />
3) Awakening of Azeroth/Void Lord expansion<br />
<br />
a) leveling content in space<br />
b) Tinker class (it would fit Titan theme)<br />
c) final battle with Void Lords<br />
<br />
Depend of the state of the game they can always invent new threat beyond 10.0, but I don't think they will drag Void Lords threat longer than 10 years.</div></div><hr />

Well when i first tried Final Fantasy XIV with a trial account it was right in the middle of the first year annivesary celebration. Each and every content of the event was doable on a trial account. And I loved them all. And it convinced me to play the game. By the way thanks to the extreme ability pruning 1-20 is pretty horrible now. 2 button rotations, empty levels where you don't get skills for leveling up or useful gear for doing quests.<br />
<br />
... So it's like Max level Classic gameplay. At level 20 it shouldn't be expected to have everything... Although my last character to 20 seemed to have more abilities than 2 at 20... <br />
<br />
Edit: as a Mage I count that I'll have 7 abilities to use by 20. Fire blast, Flurry, Blizzard, Ice Lance, Frost bolt being among those that are damage-dealing.<br />
<br />
Edit 2: As a Warrior I count also 5 damage-dealing abilities by 20. Slam, Mortal Strike, Colossus smash, Victory rush, Execute. Not counting the alterations made once choosing spec of course.</div></div><hr />

The main problem is actually that 50% of the people instantly drop the group once they have their loot an the other half ist often half afk drooling over what just dropped. :D</div></div><hr />

Sorry it was a bit misleading. I'm not saying you'll literally have two abilities at 20. But for most of the 1-20 leveling range you will have a 2 button rotation. You can have dozens of very situational skills(you don't) but it doesn't mean jack if your hunter literally just uses one of two abilities and sees arrows flying out of its chest.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is I was actually excited for Legion and contemplated comming back, but when I checked the class changes on a trial account...Let's just say I had less fun than I had with WoD with the same classes on the same level range. It's pretty nice that the trial account has no time limitation on it, but there isn't much to do. Especially with pet battles also locked out. The ARR trial is only 14 days, but you can go all the way up to level 35. For reference the current level cap is 60.<br />
At the very least it would be nice to be more lenient with those who had a subscription. *cough* SWTOR *cough*</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this. 1-20 is shite.<br />

Find a spawn point in the World at Broken Isles and you can solo it without much issues or the one in the Dalaran Sewers since there is always someone there.</div></div><hr />

I was done with this in 15 minutes as far as I'm concerned... Ran to the sewer....portal was open...ran in killed the Cow King got the lute. Don't see any reason to get the bag or the town portal thing. Why get just another hearthstone.. bag is a waste. <br />
