Guardian Cub Tradable Pet Now Available!<br />
The new Guardian Cub pet is now available, and you can trade it and sell it at the auction house! <br />
Now available in the Pet Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/browse.xml?f=c:5,c:33): the new and titanically cute Guardian Cub (http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100001590) companion. Orphaned by its titan creators, the fledgling Guardian Cub has taken wing to look for a happy home. Adopt one today and it will stay by your side through thick and thin, following your character just about anywhere your adventures take you—even into the skies of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
The Guardian Cub is the Pet Store's first tradable pet, meaning it can be swapped between characters in-game or given as a gift to guildmates, friends, family, or that special someone (after a cooldown period -- see below). Due to his finicky nature, each Guardian Cub will only give its allegiance to one owner, meaning it’s a one-time-use pet that permanently binds to a single character. Be sure to choose a master wisely.<br />
<br />
The Guardian Cub is available now in the Pet Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/browse.xml?f=c:5,c:33). Check out the mini-FAQ below for more information on how this flying friend differs from other Pet Store companions.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Q: How does the Guardian Cub pet work? How is it different from other Pet Store pets?<br />
Unlike the other Pet Store companions, the Guardian Cub is a tradable, one-time-use pet that permanently binds to a single character upon use. When you purchase the Guardian Cub from the online store, the character you designate will receive a bind-on-use item in his or her in-game mailbox, which can then be added to the character’s inventory. You can either use the item yourself to permanently add the pet to your character's collection (consuming the item in the process), or -- after an initial 24-hour cooldown period -- you can trade the item to another player so he or she can add it to one of their character's collections. Note that once the pet has been added to a character's Companions list, it can no longer be traded, so make sure you're giving the cub a happy home.<br />
<br />
Q: Will I be able to carry more than one Guardian Cub at a time?<br />
While a character can only have one Guardian Cub in his or her Companions list, you can have as many in your inventory as you like. Please note that Guardian Cub items do not stack, so each one will take up a bag or bank slot.<br />
<br />
Q: How much will the Guardian Cub cost in the Pet Store?<br />
The Guardian Cub will be priced the same as the other Pet Store pets ($10 USD). All sales of the Guardian Cub are final -- no refunds will be given once a purchase is made.<br />
<br />
Q: Why did you decide to make the Guardian Cub tradable?<br />
Since the introduction of the Pet Store, many players have been asking for ways to get the companions we offer there without having to spend real-world cash. By making the Guardian Cub tradable (much like the BoE mounts from the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game), players interested in the new pet will have fun, alternative in-game ways to get one. In addition to trading the pet, players can give the Guardian Cub as a gift to another character for a special occasion; guild leaders can use them to reward members for a job well done; and so on. We also hope this change will help reduce the number of incidents of scamming via trading for invalid pet codes.<br />
<br />
Q: Could I put the Guardian Cub up on the auction house to try to make some gold if I wanted to?<br />
While our goal is to offer players alternative ways to add a Pet Store pet to their collection, we’re ok with it if some players choose to use the Guardian Cub as a safe and secure way to try to acquire a little extra in-game gold without turning to third-party gold-selling services. However, please keep in mind that there's never any guarantee that someone will purchase what you put up for sale in the auction house, or how much they'll pay for it. Also, it’s important to note that we take a firm stance against buying gold from outside sources because in most cases, the gold these companies offer has been stolen from compromised accounts. (You can read more about our stance here.) While some players might be able to acquire some extra gold by putting the Guardian Cub in the auction house, that’s preferable to players contributing to the gold-selling “black market” and account theft.<br />
<br />
Q: Are you changing the other available Pet Store pets (e.g. Lil' Ragnaros, the Pandaren Monk) to work this way?<br />
No, the other available Pet Store pets will continue to work as they always have.<br />
<br />
Q: What about future Pet Store pets?<br />
It's too early to say how we'll handle future Pet Store pets. We made this change in response to feedback from players looking for alternate ways to get the Pet Store pets, and we're always looking into other opportunities for improvement. We're interested in hearing what players think of the Guardian Cub, and we hope you'll have fun with this new flying friend.</div></div><hr />

This is true for now, though once MoP goes live pets are account wide.</div></div><hr />

20k o_O<br />
<br />
Even on my server the most rare pets don't go for over 15k, and I'm sure this pet is not gonna be a rarity.<br />
<br />
I'd be happy to pay 3-4k for it but i don't really see how it can be worth much more. (If it turns out it is gonna be a common item)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea was simply being able to gift them to people in game (heavily requested idea on the official forums) with out having to share the item redemption code. I don't think this thing was made for the sole intention of selling on the AH.</div></div><hr />

Probably so Blizzard could check if the payment made for the pet was invalid, for an example being paid with a stolen credit card. Whether they actually do so, I don't know.</div></div><hr />

LOL. If you go by gold seller prices, they should be 10k, but if you go by supply and demand, I would be surprised if they fetch over 5k. Of course, the first day they might be more expensive, and then everyone realises that the 24 hour cooldown was so they wouldn't notice 5000 people bought it on their realm and it's worthless :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This, and I think even that is pretty high, to be honest. People predicting higher prices don't seem to really remember that it only sells for $10, so ridiculous thousands and thousands of dollar price tags are highly unlikely after the initial introduction of people flooding them onto the auction house. (And the market is likely to come down really low in the first few weeks after it's introduced)</div></div><hr />

If the price is too much, if it not being BOA is a reason to not get it in your eyes then don't buy it.

I suspect that no one would put it on the AH for a low price just to undercut people, after having spent $10. I could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

And the new xpac is probably more than 12 months away. They usually announce the xpac at the Bizzcon the year before it's released. (Someone'll correct me if I'm wrong, I suppose.)</div></div><hr />

That is true but the stuff they showed at Blizzcon this year was much further ahead in the development.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They specifically said at Blizzcon that not all pets would be made account wide, this will probably be done to tradable in-game pets so that they retain their rare value. Like the dragon welps, hycin macaw, etc. Considering they specifically state that this one goes on a single character, and that players are likely already spending money to add the pet on multiple characters, it is HIGHLY unlikely that this pet will be distributed account-wide when 5.0 drops.</div></div><hr />

Reputable ones, no, but how few of them must there be compared to the normal hack-and-rape gold spammers?</div></div><hr />

If they'll buy your gold from you just as soon as they'd sell you gold they have, they're probably not in the hacking business. They're just middlemen.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd rather there be no gold selling in the game at all and any gold found to be part of gold selling to be removed from the game completely and both users receiving a minimum of 3 days ban.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, with them them actively encouraging it while categorically denying it, I'd rather them just get out of the way and allow players to directly trade gold between each other for whatever price they negotiate, real or digital, and simply cut the middleman out of the equation completely.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to get on one side of the issue and stay there, rather than sitting on the fence and lying to their players.<br />
<br />
Either way, I see too much gold in the economy and a smaller and smaller percentage of the player base actually farming for their personal use because the gold simply piles up, accounts get hacked, and the duplicated gold lands back on the free market because people are willing to throw money at hackers to produce counterfeit gold so they can purchase items with no investment of time.</div></div><hr />

Except you never know how much gold you will get for pets and if there is any demand at all, making pets worthless as alternative currency. No one is going to accept pets as payment as they will have to sell them on the AH themselves, trying to get their gold.</div></div><hr />

I agree 100% with what you just said. What a sellout. This is blizz realizing they cannot control gold farming, and thus deciding to officially get into the business themselves.</div></div><hr />

I thought they said all pets would be account wide from now on, why are they saying this pet will be character only if it's just going to be account wide later on?<br />
They said MOST pets would become BoA, but not all. This is most likely one of the latter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is this even close to Blizzard selling gold? They are not directly exchanging gold for real money, nor are they adding any gold to the economy with this.<br />
<br />
If you read previous Blizz posts regarding this, you would understand this is Blizzard exploring new ideas for stamping out gold sellers in hopes of keeping accounts more secure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope the 1 day duration means it will stop being soulbound after 24 hours and instead become BOE (aka sellable in the AH).</div></div><hr />

And then what would that person do with 2 Cubs? Try to sell them? It would cost the seller a lot of time and effort to sell the Cubs and no guaranteed value. Obviously that would never work.</div></div><hr />

Come to think of it, having SoJ's as a currency is pretty rediculous.....but it was there.<br />
I don't think it would head that way for the tradeable pets tho (i might buy one of the ah for own use as i'm not realy into buying pets with real money)</div></div><hr />

This way some people also can sell them for real money via Paypall cheaper than Bliz. So people m8 get in game stuf with Dolars an Euros. If that happens it would be begining of dark days of WoW ingame economy. But eventually people will get bored from this pet and look for new one.</div></div><hr />

I notice ALL pet, mount, gametime, etc in the blizzstore have a button &quot;Add To Cart&quot; but for some reason the new pet Guardian Cub doesnt have one instead it has &quot;Redeem in BatleNet&quot; Gaurdian Cub pet is the only one which has that button. No matter how much I click it nothing happens, also tried right click and see the options there isnt anything like example open in new tab or open link, etc As if its just a regular picture. I want to buy this pet but as what I stated it wont work. I tried doble clicking nothing happens, I tried single click none happens, I tried spam clicking still nothing. Then I notice a guildy already have it and he doesnt seem to have the same problem. What could have cause this prob to me??Also in the status bar of my internet explorer says Javascript:void(0)Im using internet explorer 9 (9.0.3)</div></div><hr />
