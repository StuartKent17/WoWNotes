<br />
Where is the instance btw? I've been around quite a bit of Icecrown, and I can't stay on long enough to find out. Seems to me the most important thing, and I've been looking around cursory at Blizzard or here, doesn't seem to list it.<br />
<br />
Second the changes that have been sneaking in, makes me wonder if your slipping a bit, I was totally taken aback by the fact you can skip the Pagentry in the hToc. I play on the ptr and read the site like every 5 mins. I know I must be missing stuff, anyways normally everyone is on par, and I check here before i check blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theres at least one imporant line spoken by Sargaeras himself: &quot;You have failed me, Varimathras(sp?)&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
That audio clip is from the Wrathgate questline for the Horde. At the end of the chain when retaking Undercity an &quot;unknown&quot; voice yells that out to Varimathras and the only way the player-base learned the voice belonged to Sargeras was by datamining the filename. I Don't know the exact file but it isn't a new part of Icecrown, but rather the questline I just mentioned.</div></div><hr />

You basically need a Dwarf there named Muradin Bronzebeard. Who would notice a inscription on the dias next to the sword that reads 'Whomsoever takes up this blade shall wield power eternally just as the blade rends flesh so must power scar the spirit(?). &quot;The blade is cursed, let's get the hell out of here. I remember it as 'this place has a bad omen this a foolish quest and a bad place, leave this be and walk away.'<br />
<br />
Honestly from a player point of view, would you even touch the sword, or even think about it, if you had half the chance?</div></div><hr />

Halls of Reflection could imply a reflected reality, I reckon we end up having to fight Terenas in some strange fight where Arthas tries to make us follow in his footsteps by &quot;killing&quot; Terenas. Would explain why his model was added, even using Frostmourne from the pedestal.... although that last bit is too far fetched</div></div><hr />

Well... could be... We have a room which resembles the one Terenas was killed in (+the new Terenas model), we have Arthas, Frostmourne, Falric and Marwyn...</div></div><hr />

It looks like the ice breaks away and falls. So like TOC25 when the Lich King stabs the ground with Frostmourne, and the ground breaks away and everyone falls. Except it will only be one area at a time, and it will reform shortly after allowing people to regroup on to it.<br />
<br />
That will require people to move QUICKLY or fall and die. Sounds like the dance of all dances IMO!</div></div><hr />

I will say again that WOTLK is by far the best expansion for WoW and this will be like adding cherry to the cream filled cake. <br />

So, why is there a &quot;Plage Quarter&quot; in the citadel?</div></div><hr />

At the end of the chain when retaking Undercity an &quot;unknown&quot; voice yells that out to Varimathras and the only way the player-base learned the voice belonged to Sargeras was by datamining the filename. I Don't know the exact file but it isn't a new part of Icecrown, but rather the questline I just mentioned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn, never knew that<br />
Also on a sidenote, Dear god, where'd you get your pic from? I'm laughing my ass off over here</div></div><hr />

Raid: &quot;Prepare yourself Arthas! We are here to kill you!&quot;<br />
Arthas: &quot;O'snap, now where did I put that damn sword...&quot;<br />

Arthas knows kung fu, he doesn't need his sword.</div></div><hr />
