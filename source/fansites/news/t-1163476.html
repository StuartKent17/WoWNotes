Welcome to the World of Warcraft Patch 5.0.4 Public Test Realm. We thank you for testing Patch 5.0.4 with us, and ask that you participate in our PTR Feedback forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1181024/) and our PTR Bug Report forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/2359401/).<br />
<br />
Your feedback is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Please note that PTR testing is restricted to World of Warcraft game accounts that do not have access to the Mists of Pandaria beta test. You can find more information on this here (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6008461841).<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Account-wide Achievements, pets, and mounts<br />
<br />
In Patch 5.0.4 and beyond, the majority of your character's Achievements, pets, and mounts will be shared with your other characters. Please read: Bringing Achievements to the Account Level (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/5367158), by Greg &quot;Ghostcrawler&quot; Street<br />
<br />
<br />
World Event: Attack on Theramore Isle<br />
<br />
Warchief Garrosh, obsessed with assuring the Horde’s supremacy over Kalimdor, launches an all-out attack against Jaina's island home of Theramore. Though valiant Alliance defenders rush to repel the sudden onslaught, they’ll soon find themselves unprepared for the terrible scope of Garrosh's true plans…<br />
In the Public Test Realm, we will be testing this event at specified intervals. Keep an eye on our PTR Feedback forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1181024/) for more details as they become available.<br />
<br />
<br />
AOE Looting<br />
<br />
Area of effect looting comes to World of Warcraft with this patch. After killing a group of enemies in close proximity, when you loot one of their corpses, the loot window will include items from all of the nearby corpses for which you have loot rights.<br />
<br />
<br />
BattleTag (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battletagfaq) support in World of Warcraft<br />
<br />
Players who have enabled their BattleTag (http://www.battle.net/account/management/battletag-create.html) will now be able to:<br />
<br />
See BattleTag friends in your friends list.<br />
Add and remove BattleTag friends.<br />
Send BattleTag invites to other players via right-click.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
All classes have been updated with a new talent system (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/feature/talent-specification#f%21), improved abilities, and spells (accessible throughout levels 1-85). Your character's talents have been reset.<br />
<br />
Many old talents have been converted to specialization abilities.<br />
Druids now have access to a fourth class specialization: Guardian.<br />
New spells are now learned automatically. Class trainers are only needed to change talents, glyphs, class specialization, or to utilize the dual specialization feature.<br />
All characters now take 30% less damage from other players.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Currency Conversion<br />
<br />
Coming soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Spell Penetration has been replaced by PvP Power on existing items.<br />
Head enchants removed<br />
<br />
Enchants that modify the gear in your head slot have been removed (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/6195247) from the game. This includes older head enchants of every type.<br />
<br />
<br />
Relics, ranged, and thrown items<br />
<br />
The slot in which ranged, relics, and thrown items were previously equipped has been removed. All weapons should now be equipped in the weapon slot.<br />
Ranged weapons, including wands, have been adjusted to be more powerful.<br />
Ranged weapons no longer have a minimum range.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
The glyph system has been updated. Many class glyphs have been added, altered, or moved to different glyph types.<br />
Prime glyphs have been removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
There is a new user interface for your mounts and pets.<br />
Character creation screens have been updated.<br />
Buffs have been consolidated in the UI.<br />
New roll results frame added. This new feature can be accessed by clicking the word &quot;[Loot]&quot; in chat, or by typing &quot;/loot&quot;.<br />
The PvE queue frames have been unified. You can now queue for dungeons, raids, and other queue-able content in one handy place.<br />
Vendors now offer item filtering.<br />
Spellbooks have been updated to reflect changes to core abilities, and now include a brief overview of specializations.<br />
The Dungeon Journal has been expanded with information on all pre-Cataclysm encounters.<br />
A new help system has been added to many frames. You can toggle this on and off by clicking the &quot;i&quot; button in the upper left corner of the frame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not necessarily. 4.0.1 was live for 2 months, so more like October.<br />
<br />
That sucks though, means we can only get 4 more H-Madness mounts before they shut it off. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually they stated that the pre-event would be 2 weeks before release, so that makes the release date of half september pretty plausible.<br />
<br />
Just logged in, and I can try stuff for 1-3 minutes before dc-ing so not much testing done. Already transferred my char before the patch was live, so no problems there.<br />
That said I'm missing out of a lot of achievements I have. On the world events I miss an awful lot of them.</div></div><hr />

This is going to be great !<br />
<br />
Says the guy playing the faction that, once again, doesn't get trampled all over. Seriously, unless this thing gives a nice cosmetic reward or something, I may actually skip this event.<br />
<br />
On to my actual point, I noticed the line on the post itself saying that &quot;pet battles are not live YET&quot;. <br />
<br />
Was this to mean that pet battles could go out with 5.0, or is this to meant hat pet battles are not on the PTR because they will be shipped alongside MoP?<br />
<br />
If they go live with 5.0, I know what I'm doing for two weeks before the expansion!<br />
<br />
P.S. : 30% reduced damage from other players makes me less worried about going past my city borders. Less. I'll still probably hide there, anyway.</div></div><hr />

Coming soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is this?<br />
<br />
How much money you will get from excess justice points after valor is converted to jp.<br />
<br />
When the MoP prepatch hits all your valor will be converted to JP. All items that currently require valor will instead require justice. If you are over 4000 jp you will be unable to gain additional jp, and if you are still over 4000 after 1 week you will go back down to 4000 and any excess will be converted into gold, thus the conversion. The same thing goes for conquest and honor.</div></div><hr />

I remember seeing these random Elemental-things all around Org and shit. You had the &quot;option&quot; to partake in the &quot;event&quot; which made it feel hella lackluster.

Not exactly sure how to report &quot;Login being incredibly buggy/nonresponsive&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm getting random &quot;You have been disconnected from the server&quot; during login, then the 2nd attempt it does it again, and finally on the 3rd attempt it lets me in...only to find that I'm sitting in a queue to login.<br />
<br />
And I'm probably just going to get d/c'd after 2 minutes just like the last time I finally got in.</div></div><hr />

Seriously Blizzard? You'd think that after seven years they'd be past bugginess like this.<br />

A. It's PTR<br />
B. Everyone and his grandmother are currently trying to log in at the same time, which probably cause the majority of the DC's anyway<br />

B is often also the reason why first days of major patches and expansion launches are often unplayable</div></div><hr />

actually, pet battles are a feature of MoP and therefore not apart of patch 5.0, 5.0 includes systems and other changes coming to the game as a whole, not MoP features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you had cared to read my post (which I'm assuming you didn't based on your rage), you'd see that I'm talking about login and general client stability. Not the content.<br />
<br />
It's kinda hard to do any testing when it takes 30 minutes to log in, and then I get d/c'd after 2 minutes and get all sorts of d/c errors when trying to log in, as well as unresponsive servers and such.<br />
<br />

Yes we lose our melee weapons but since they removed the minimum range limit of guns and bows you can be up close and personal and not have to move to be able to use them..<br />

Yes takes some getting used too, but it does offer a limited form of Hybridization, (example my mage is arcane but she has the talent thus the spell Ice Barrier that was only ever available to Frost Mages.) So far in beta have leveled 3 toons to 90 so once sorted it is very nice system. And because of it there seems to be a lot more in ones spellbook than there was before.<br />

<br />
As with most things folks want to play something new and shiney, but after awhile it goes the same way as anything else. And yeah I can't work it out either in that yes you can play both for that reason of GW2 not having subs but it might go the micro transactions route.<br />
<br />
But another thing just occurred to me with what I have seen on this and other forums of the hatred towards WoW that could be another reason too.</div></div><hr />

lol. But yes AOE looting is so cool, no more having the rummage through 50 dead mobs now so long as they are relatively close to each other. And for hunters they have the awesome fetch glyph which allows you to send your pet to loot mobs that either A: Be far away B: In a dangerous area or C: Because you are too lazy to run over there to loot it. :)<br />

You must think most people have tons of time to play games. Come back to the real world and you'll realize that most people will play ONE of the games. If someone considers both games to be fun but only time for one they're obviously going to pick the one that has NO subs.</div></div><hr />

But yes AOE looting is so cool, no more having the rummage through 50 dead mobs now so long as they are relatively close to each other. And for hunters they have the awesome fetch glyph which allows you to send your pet to loot mobs that either A: Be far away B: In a dangerous area or C: Because you are too lazy to run over there to loot it. :)<br />

<br />
Yeah AOE looting is very cool and as far as I know achievements are account wide same with some titles as my other toons have Guardian of Cenarius and they never did the rep grind to get it as it was my hunter who did all the work. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am going to ruffle some feathers here.. but they really need to limit the PTR to people who have an active account. Too many people use PTR as a way to play for free beyond level 20. Because there are so many people out there without subscriptions, it just creates too large of a pool of players and the PTR servers are now dysfunctional.<br />
<br />
There are more than enough people with active accounts willing to test the PTR. Allowing non-subs to bombard the servers means nothing is being tested now. Nobody can stay online for more than 3 mins, and most are just locked out.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Got d/c'd after 3 minutes, but managed to log back in quickly.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Keeps on d/c'ing me after 3-4 minutes. However, it still gives d/c errors when trying to log in, and takes 4+ attempts to log in. If I log in quickly enough, I don't have to wait in queue.<br />
<br />
So yeah. I can get into PTR after a long queue, but it just repeatedly d/c's me every 2-4 minutes. So much fun.</div></div><hr />

Seeing how during the MoP press tour it was announced to be one of the &quot;scenarios&quot; and later it was a scenario on the Beta before it was taken down.<br />
They better make this the Operation Gnomeregan/Zalazane's Fall of the pre-event and follow up with something very huge because from what I remember the Theramore &quot;scenario&quot; is short. (Cata had aforementioned short event + elemental invasion).</div></div><hr />
