Raid Testing Schedule - April 15-18<br />
On Friday, April 15, and Monday, April 18, we will continue our Legion Alpha raid testing.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires 20 and does not scale.<br />
<br />
There are a couple of bugs active in the current build - the obvious phasing issue, and an issue that causes many player abilities (and some boss abilities) to not properly consume resources. We have a hotfix in flight for the second issue as I write this; the phasing issue is under investigation, but shouldn't impact raid tests. Of course, should anything change on that front, we'll update our testing plans accordingly.<br />
<br />
Friday, April 15<br />
<br />
Ursoc - Mythic Emerald Nightmare<br />
13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
Chronomatic Anomaly - Heroic Nighthold<br />
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 00:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Monday, April 18<br />
<br />
Nythendra - Mythic Emerald Nightmare<br />
13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
High Botanist Tel'arn - Heroic Nighthold<br />
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 00:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of an alpha environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

Discipline Priest Feedback -- Build 21466 -- 13-Apr<br />
You guys have pretty much figured it out, but, right--the passive damage increase on the artifact should not increase Atonement healing. The traits on the artifact itself should ultimately increase Disc's total healing ability (including both Atonement and non-Atonement) by the same amount as the other healers' artifacts. We do want to figure out how to make this clearer.<br />
<br />
Disc should be able get use out of DPS trinkets, but we have to make sure they're not overpowered. For example, they have to add less healing than healing trinkets. Corrupted Starlight as the twin problems of being AoE (which will always risk being overpowered for Atonement purposes) and being an RPPM proc (which results in it adding the same amount of DPS to Disc's low damage as it does to a caster's high damage). We will likely reduce RPPM proc rates for Disc on trinkets like this.

Destruction Warlock Feedback -- Build 21466 -- 13-Apr<br />
Is Chaos Barrage intended to be a portal that is SIGNIFICANTLY better than the other two portals?<br />
These are still subject to tuning; however, they will likely have some variance in how much damage they do (among other reasons, due to the different durations).

Paywall? Seriously?<br />
If you don't know the entire story in your sleep by now, just go home.<br />
<br />
It's called marketing. Newsflash, a lot of major pictures have an accompanying book. At least this is a graphic novel. Usually they're just regular novels that are an adapted screenplay with a movie scene on the cover.</div></div><hr />

Because movie tie-ins are big money.<br />

And so much for my plan of keeping my alts in their garrisons, running missions to get crates, so that I can build up a decent stock of transmog appearances.<br />
<br />
I suppose it's because of the gold-making potential of the salvage yard that they're doing this? I mean, they couldn't just auto-bind anything that came out of the crates (so no effect on gold-making, sorta), they had to just eliminate anything decent coming from them?<br />

I am pretty sure Blizz have already stated that gear from Salvage crates won't go into the legion wardrobe. You have to have earned the gear from questing, raiding etc (all options unlocked)</div></div><hr />

Or looting. Like looting green stuff. On trash mobs. Which is exactly the same gear as the salvage gear. Except you currently don't have to go to old zones to farm those old trash mobs.<br />
<br />
In fact, when they announced the salvage boxes, they explicitly said the gear in there was selected from popular transmog choices. The salvage gear WAS intended for transmog (what? you really thought it was intended to gear up your alts? really?).<br />
<br />
Now, the real reason isn't about transmog, of course, it's about selling back the green trash for gold, which is a steady source of gold, and they are make extremely sure that there will be absolutely no reason whatsoever to stay in your garrison (I'm also expecting the gold bags at the trading post to disappear fairly soon).<br />
<br />
Too bad they're also throwing the main source of low-level transmog along with it. Sometimes, the Blizzard's obsession about making low level content totally irrelevant is... irritating.</div></div><hr />

Gold. Green stuff from those large crates yield 6-7g average (more on weapons, less on useless jewelry), which makes the crates &quot;useful&quot; to farm gold with your alts sitting on their pre-legion mission tables.<br />
<br />
Since their explicit goal is to make any pre-expansion content absolutely irrelevant, they were suddenly facing with a bad choice: keep the old-content transmog and let gold flow, or destroy gold flows and throw the transmog baby along with the bathwater.<br />
<br />
Now what's really important is what that description change implies: does it mean that level 3 salvage yards give standard Crates of Salvage with higher chance than normal, or does it means that it yields Large Crate of Salvages that have no green/blue/epics in them except the level 100 specific gear (whose transmog isn't available anywhere else).<br />
<br />
If it's the former, you can stockpile Large crates by 20 in your bank to open for a change of transmogs at 7.0 patch. If it's the latter, then you have no choice but to open as many crates you can, stuff your bank and void storage to the gills with useless green stuff waiting for 7.0, then cash in when the Wardrobe patch finally lets you empty your bank.<br />
<br />
(in other words, the latter would be stupid. But then, sometimes Blizzard takes weird ass decisions)</div></div><hr />

You don't have to explain to me how garrisons work. It seems you're misunderstanding what's going on. The line removed, the one referring to player items, has only ever referred to the blue 610 transmog gear, the &quot;new character&quot; class gear.</div></div><hr />

No, i'm not. In fact, on twitter, the Warcraft devs clarified this change: the &quot;new&quot; tier 3 salvage yard will give a NEW crate. You can stockpile on old crates and open them after 7.0 to fill your wardrobe (wew):<br />
<br />
https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/721031512083202048<br />
<br />
While it's not too explicit (140 char limit), that tweet does in fact address specifically the transmog problem. Further clarification says that some transmogs WILL in fact become unobtainable, but &quot;Many player items from salvage still drop elsewhere, however&quot; (i.e. all the green/blue/epic BOE stuff).</div></div><hr />

At least with the Farm in MoP, you could use it with alts leveling through to get materials to do professions and such. Feels like when you get an Alt to WOD - you'll hit a brick wall in terms of getting anything done. <br />
<br />
The way they're going, they should just turn off all the old content, unless it's needed for the current, and start everyone with boosted characters.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Getting anything done&quot; with WoD never had anything to do with the salvage yard. Unless you were 'getting done' the 610 class gear transmog sets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't have minded if they changed the crates to soul-bind gear that comes out of it. Even if it meant that the gear you get out couldn't always be put into your transmog set (because, from what I understand, you can only add stuff you could possibly equip--which means a cloth-wearer getting a plate helm under my idea would be S.O.L.), at least it would let people have a decent set of transmog with alts.<br />
<br />
Heck, if they'd done that, I would have bought the transmog yak...</div></div><hr />

That's different. Once you've got the heirloom, you don't have to keep going back to farm for it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Big difference between &quot;get 5k gold per day from treasure missions&quot; and &quot;get 100 gold per day from selling off excess garrison resources.&quot;<br />

So stock up on crates now then. <br />

All this does is remove a reason to go back to your garrison every day during Legion. And whining about being 'forced' to do so in order to get transmog. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I ran two alts at level 90 through Argent Tournament to get heirlooms, and ran eleven alts through Darkmoon Faire every month, to buy all the heirlooms. By your reasoning, they should have eliminated getting heirlooms from Argent Tournament, since Darkmoon Faire had it. (Heck, they should have eliminated prize tickets for all but the new racing and flying games...) <br />

Exactly. And there are rewards other than 'gold' behind those things. Rep, items, etc.<br />

And? You say below, it's to keep people from going back to the garrisons. Well, do you remember when they had to change the Kraken daily in Argent Tournament, because people had to run it dozens of times to get the eight hits? People were still going back, to content that was two expansions prior, and Blizzard changed it so that people could do that.<br />

That's nice. Does it make you feel smug to purposefully misrepresent what someone is saying? I mean, I can go out and ask to borrow a scarecrow, if you need a strawman argument.<br />
<br />
People do old content. So why is some old content good, and some old content bad?<br />
<br />
<br />
I never said it was solely about farming gold, buddy boy. :D Just about keeping people from going back to the garrison every day during Legion.<br />
<br />
So what is it about? One set of old content that is bad, and must be destroyed, completely unlike other sets of old content that is good, and must be kept because it keeps people subscribed?<br />
<br />
I asked that the salvage yard be left so that people can get transmog (but in such a way that people can't profit off of it by auctioning off the gear). That's no different than people running the Timeless Isle pet tournament (cosmetic rewards). That's a lot less than people running the Cata raids on a dozen alts (getting lots of gold).<br />

With Argent Tournament, I would have to deal with dange... No, wait, it wasn't dangerous, because I was doing it two expansions later (towards the end of MoP).<br />
<br />
Okay, I had to deal with taking 30 minutes to do the Arge... No, wait, I did it so many times, it rarely took more than 10-15 minutes.<br />
<br />
I was getting cosmetic rewa... No, wait, I'm asking for transmog appearances. Not even asking to put the items on the auction house, just to get the &quot;look and feel&quot; of costumes.<br />
<br />

But you still have to do the quest, and all you get is currency to buy stuff. It's not the transmog loot pinata that Salvage Yard is. <br />
<br />
I don't want to get into this whole snarky pissing contest thing. So I'll just leave it at this: I think they're changing the Salvage Yard because the reward would be too good. It's not enough of a time sink to justify. Old content remains in place for those doing the content as much as for higher level players. And keeping the Salvage Yard transmog stuff and making it soulbound would just make the problem worse. <br />
<br />
Although you did give me a good chuckle out of describing the Salvage Yard as 'doing content', after all the people complaining garrisons are a Facebook game...</div></div><hr />

Gating content behind the mission table as i thought they would, Blizzard really know how to fuck up their own game. Time to go play on a Private server i think. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has it so damn backwards, why not send us on these quests instead of putting it into a UI where all you do is click and wait 24hours. Blizzard are morons...<br />

Have fun leveling a character only to have Blizzard shut down the server! lol</div></div><hr />

It's a book, pretty much ANY IP WITH ANY SORT OF LORE these days has books with stories in it.<br />

Jesus Christ you people are inane.<br />
<br />
Its not free if the sucker is paying a subscription. Id say giving it to the mugs still paying for this garbage is the least they could do considering they haven't released any content for how long now? <br />

Jesus Christ you people just love being ripped off dont you?..well as long as its Blizzard?<br />

Shills will be shills. Just look at Crepe on the official forums. No matter how bad something is, there will always be someone to defend it. Unless its Big Rigs or something like that.</div></div><hr />

How anti fun are you guys... PvP is looking more and more like shit...<br />
<br />
PvP is moving away from being gear dominated which sucks if you werent there at the start when the gear was a non-issue.<br />
Gives the impression you enjoy stomping on players that cant compete because they are undergeared, and therefore unlike those in at the start have a now unfair and harder task when it comes to getting anything better.<br />
Why should gear dominate in a format when you cant choose your opponents.<br />
<br />
In PvE if you are undergeared for content, you can select opponents you are better geared for.<br />
That is not the case in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With Argent Tournament, I would have to deal with dange... No, wait, it wasn't dangerous, because I was doing it two expansions later (towards the end of MoP).<br />
<br />
Okay, I had to deal with taking 30 minutes to do the Arge... No, wait, I did it so many times, it rarely took more than 10-15 minutes.<br />
<br />
I was getting cosmetic rewa... No, wait, I'm asking for transmog appearances. Not even asking to put the items on the auction house, just to get the &quot;look and feel&quot; of costumes.<br />
<br />
Sorry, it's hard for a &quot;simple country Hyper-Chicken,&quot; so please enumerate how easy-to-obtain cosmetic rewards from one source is perfectly okay, but easy-to-obtain cosmetic rewards from another source is unacceptable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's not get ignorant here.<br />
<br />
You know damn well it's much different and easier, with no effort.<br />
<br />
Masterplan: click, click and they're all sent out. Do that to all of your alts and continuing playing the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, they need 7.0 to come out with the wardrobe, already.</div></div><hr />

Ohhhhhh... So it's about the amount of effort per unit of gold?<br />
<br />
About 1hr45m per week (per alt), 6000 gold. http://blizzardwatch.com/2015/05/24/shifting-perspectives-soloing-cataclysm-raids-6000g-week/<br />
<br />
Another guide says 1hr45m per week, 8000 gold. http://www.thegoldqueen.com/farming-guides/raiding-gold-cataclysm-25-man-heroic-farming/ (Just pure gold and vendored items, doesn't include auction house.)<br />
<br />
So Blizzard says that 3400 gold per hour is acceptable (rounding).<br />
<br />
Okay, so five minutes running followers through missions and opening crates should get you about 285 gold. Agreed? I mean, unless Blizzard is saying that Cata gold farming is acceptable, but a similar rate of gold farming in WoD is unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
Effort means everything, even though crates aren't a big deal or a big way to get gold, it takes no effort whatsoever. And since it would have no effort at all, they don't want to make you feel obligated to go back and do garrison missions. Not like the Argent Tournament and old raids for gold.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus, they nerfed the gold once before, they probably will sometime again.</div></div><hr />

I always did fine against geared people when my alts didnt have the gear, skill still had a lot more to do with it than gear. Maybe not so much in WoD thats cause Blizzard has already begun ruining PvP</div></div><hr />

Gear did have a huge impact, as much as some like to ignore that.<br />
Obviously you have in your mind a rather narrow view of what pvp is, and anything eise is &quot;ruining it&quot;.<br />
This is very much a step in the right direction.<br />
Taking gear largely out of it puts the emphasis, and the results back towards skill.<br />
Personally I think that gear item level should have no impact whatsoever, small or not.<br />
Though I do miss the potential option of at least favouring certain stats.<br />
<br />
Players there at the start had a much fairer game, as the gear would have been a lot similar.<br />
Should someone starting late be placed at an unfair gear advantage.<br />
PvE has opponent progression, in that if you aren't geared for one you can go lower.<br />
PvP does not have that.</div></div><hr />

Naw I do not have a narrow mind at all, PvP has gone through lots of changes through out the years. I never had a real issue with those changes, but I do now. Taking away CHOICE is a horrible thing. Legion numbers will show this.</div></div><hr />

And what choice exactly is it removing, except for the stat priority which likely had a superior choice anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The choice of building your character.. The point of games like this is to build your character the way the you want.. Not get a copy/paste.. Sure people went on websites to find what was best. But that was their CHOICE, some chose to experiment. Or play with a stat they felt they were better with. Again all choices, now its copy/paste/forced way of playing... Not fun at all</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DeadmanWalking</div><div class="date">2016-04-23, 01:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Typical for Blizzard to put their stories behind a &quot;112 page graphic novel&quot;-paywall. Who would've thought....<br />
<br />
I know right, they should just enslave a good writer to write the book for free, produce the book for free, distribute the book for free and then give us the shit for free because we are the kind of greedy where we don't like to pay for stuff, but if we wrote the book, God damn they better pay me for my time!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with building your character in PvP was the consequence of gear progression.<br />
If perhaps you could gear up for it in terms of equipping gear to give you the stats you wanted, but still removing or minimising the item level issue would that be acceptable.</div></div><hr />

Doubt Blizz will ever get rid of the item level issue.. In any case I just dont want a copy/paste character in PvP or at all for that matter</div></div><hr />
