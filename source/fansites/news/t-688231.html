<br />
Elitist Group (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info15573-ElitistGroup.html)'s goal is to shift focus away from single scores that don't tell you anything about the users choice of gear. Instead of a single score you'll see a variety of information from experience in different tiers of dungeons and raids, to if their choice of equipment, enchants or gems matches their spec.<br />
<br />
Slash command: /elitistgroup (/eg) use /elitistgroup help for a list of slash commands.<br />
<br />
Equipment/gem/enchant<br />
Items are categorized based on their stats. Spell power is a caster item, hit is DPS, Strength is for melee dps and so on. You can see what type of item the person is wearing, as well as if it's valid for their spec. If your Holy Paladin is wearing block gear, it will flag that they are wearing gear intended for tanks. However, if they were a Protection Paladin it will allow it.<br />
<br />
While items will be categorized into their spec type, EG will also tell you if somebody is missing a gem or they are using green gems in epic gear.<br />
<br />
Dungeon experience<br />
Quickly see how experienced someone is through their achievements and stats. Everything is broken down by tier, 5 man, 10 man, 25 man and normal vs heroic. For raids, experienced is roughly 3 clears and for 5 mans it's around 6 (combined runs, not 6 of each 5 man). The scoring is setup to reward full clears. Somebody who has done the first 4 bosses in 25-man Trial of the Crusader but never clears it will have to do more runs to be considered experience than someone who clears the entire instance.<br />
<br />
Some achievements are also factored into the score to make it easier to be considered experienced. A Tribute to Insanity or The Immortal can count for an entire full clear. Even doing 25-man Ulduar hard modes will increase your 25-man Ulduar normal mode experience.<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
For both 5-mans and raids, a summary window is provided through /eg summary. Allowing you to quickly see party members talents and a quick pass/no pass for all of their gear, enchants and gems.<br />
<br />
Item level<br />
Item levels are used to give you an idea of where gear is from, as well as the players general gear quality. It is not the sole (or even the primary) stat shown. Items have quality modifiers to stop 200 blues being worth the same as 200 epics: 100% epic, 95% blue, 90% green, 60% white, 50% grey. Heirlooms are considered 187 item level blues at 80 (~2.22 item level/player level)<br />
<br />
Suggested dungeons are lowest item level dropped with a 89% modifier for 5-mans, 90% modifier for normal 10 and 25 mans, 91% modifier for heroic/hard mode 10 and 25 mans.<br />
<br />
Player notes<br />
Finished a dungeon, was your tank amazing? Player notes will let you rate him 1 - 5 as well as make a note for future reference, or for other people who group with him. You can leave one note per person, with your most recent note overwriting any old ones.<br />
<br />
Addon communication<br />
All notes, player data can be synced. You will only send your notes, and people can only request your gear data. This makes sure that there is less potential for people to mess up your database of players and corrupt it.<br />
<br />
Communications can be completely disabled, or you can choose to not listen to communications from certain channels to restrict who is allowed to request data. No communications are sent while in combat, they will be queued and processed gradually to prevent any noticeable effect on gameplay.<br />

Beastcleave during MLG Orlando<br />
I don't think this is a clothie issue at all. In fact, appropriate use of Ice Block and Demonic Circle defensively made a big difference.<br />
<br />
I also don't want to discount the skill of those players at all. Make no mistake - these are very good players. While some of the matches were over very quickly, I think you're dramatically underestimating things if you think anyone would have performed the same with same setup.<br />
<br />
That said, coordinated damage (from the BM + the shaman's wolves for example) is just really high, and in some sense it has to be or everyone will just be healed again. We need to see more matches where everyone in the game is playing in a wounded state. You need to be able to wear someone down (without just wearing the mana of the healers down). Health just needs to be higher for everyone across the board, even in PvE, and healing power has to be lower. The buckets need time to fill and drain instead of being full or empty 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
I also think it's cool to see warlocks, hunters, shaman, paladins, druids and whatever classes I forgot that saw a lot of use at MLG Orlando, besides just RMP. Ideally those other comps would use a bit more CC (even if it's not quite at the RMP level) and there would be some matches that would last longer. The announcers did a good job of the play by play, but sometimes there just weren't enough plays to really have a sense of the kind of back and forth that make competitive sports interesting. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418865496-beastcleave-takes-mlg-orlando.html))<br />
<br />
[...] This thread quickly deteriorated from talking about the MLG matches to the same old tired arguments:<br />
<br />
1) RMP is skill. Anything that isn't RMP is faceroll.<br />
<br />
vs.<br />
<br />
2) CC is boring. Let's kill something.<br />
<br />
It doesn't have to be one extreme or the other. There is room in competitive Arena for a lot of different comps. I for one am glad to see really talented players gravitating to something besides RMP vs. RMP for every match. It was nice to see other classes in there. I do wish the hunter + shaman combos fell back on other strategies more often than instantly blowing wolves + Bloodlust. In an ideal world it would be very effective (you are gambling a lot of cooldowns on that opening move after all), just less so than it is now.<br />
<br />
I don't fault the players at all -- they do it because it's effective. They focus because they have to focus -- because getting someone to 50% and switching targets would be ineffective. But if other teams could survive that initial burst a little more often, then it would be more risky, and in turn it wouldn't be so popular as the the first thing to do when the gates went up. I really don't think we're that far away from that, by which I mean we don't have to redesign every class to have Frost Nova + Ice Block to make Arena matches last a little longer.<br />
<br />
But as I said above (and most smart players realize) just buffing health / lowering damage alone won't do anything but put even *more* emphasis on burst, because getting someone to 2% will be as irrelevant as getting them to 99% (because the healers will just reset the match). Lower damage *and* lower healing and the matches will almost certainly last longer, hopefully without richocheting to the other extreme of layered CC or mana drains being the only way to play.

The problem with Warbringer<br />
The problem with the PvP side of Warbringer is that when you consider prot warrior versus mage (just as an example), there was nothing a mage could do to a well versed warrior. The warrior carries a lot of stuns, silences, and then any attempt to root him is broken by multiple abilities. So then the warrior's teammate (like a hunter) is just doing tons of damage while the target has no defenses.<br />
<br />
For the other side of this change, we certainly don't design 5-player or raid content with the assumption that the tank has Warbringer (or a way out of snares and roots in general). We understand that it can be a big help in specific situations but we don't feel it's the only option in any PvE circumstances. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/22418633982-what-shall-the-prot-nerf-be.html))<br />
<br />
Patch 3.3.x nerfs for prot warriors<br />
Let's look first at the Warbringer change.<br />
<br />
Will it nerf them for PvP? Yes. Aside from stuns and Dismantle, rooting or snaring the Prot warrior is the major way to keep him off of you. Considering all of the stuns and silences that Prot has, when they can also jump out of every Frost Nova with Warbringer, then there's not much in the way of skill a mage can employ to stay alive. They just get countered in every way.<br />
<br />
Will it nerf them for PvE? Yes, but really slightly. I'm not sure I can ever remember a case in my WoW-playing history where my warrior or some other tank caused a wipe because of a root, so even if it did happen, it can't happen that much or be that memorable. Warriors certainly won't get sat because of some new Achilles' heel and we don't design encounters around the assumption that tanks can't be rooted. The important part of Warbringer from a PvE perspective, removing the stance restrictions, is still intact.<br />
<br />
Now the damage change. As Bornakk posted recently, what we essentially did was look at some of the successful Prot PvP characters and compare them to some of the Prot tanks out there. We nerfed the block conversion to Shield Slam damage so that it would hit the PvP guy without really hitting the PvE guy. (The PvP warriors aren't stacking a ton of Shield Block Value, but they do have a lot of Strength which also converts to block for purposes of making Shield Slam hit harder -- many of these guys are wearing PvE dps plate.)<br />
<br />
Will it nerf them for PvP? Yes. We want Prot to be able to hit reasonably hard, but they also need to pay some price for their massive survivability. We thought the Warbringer change alone would nerf the warriors vs. e.g. mages but wouldn't control their damage. Those big Shield Slam crits should go down a lot.<br />
<br />
Will it nerf them for PvE? Probably not, or at least not much. If you tank with a lot of Strength or SBV, you might see your Shield Slams go down, but that's why we buffed the threat of Shield Slam to compensate.<br />
<br />
Again, keep the changes in perspective. We want Prot to be PvP viable. We don't want Prot warriors to dominate PvP or have everyone feel like they need one for their team. Likewise, we want Prot to do higher damage than the almost trivial damage that they did in BC. But that doesn't mean they need to be competitive with the dps while they're tanking.

... but a big YAY for DLC &lt;3<br />
<br />
About the addon: I detest addons who judge players by using values of gear or something. That's wrong.<br />
I was a casual player up to patch 3.3 and don't have very good &quot;gear score&quot; or what you may call it, but I do my job very well in ICC25 and I'm glad about this. No addon can &quot;tell&quot; you that. And it never will. People tend to rate players by rate their gear ... I don't like that.</div></div><hr />

With the millions of frost nova's they had a good mage would not let a warrior get close.<br />
<br />
Now prot warriors get warbringer to be abit more ffective. we now dont get stuck in frost nova's not alot atleast. the table's are turner after alot of years and mages are QQíng their eyes out. druids cry caus they cant root effective anymore. and blizzard is nerfing us back but is it really needed? Without warbranger we will be the guy sitting in roots and frost nova's for an eternity again. yes we got spll rflect but we do need rage for that.<br />
<br />
and the thing i have seen is mage's adapting to this problem by staying in range of charge. That way i cant hit him but i cant charge asswell Frost nova is effective again..<br />
<br />
imo its just alot of QQ from whiny little 12 year olds wich cant kill a class wich they previously could, and still can if they play well enough.</div></div><hr />

This is not Gearscore. As long as you are a competent enough player to gem/enchant/gear properly, you won't be flagged by this. If you're a Holy Paladin gemming Spirit you're going to get flagged... and you should. If you're a newly leveled 80 who is gemming Intellect or Spell Power, it's going to say you're fine. It really does not care about the quality of your gear, it cares that it's correct.</div></div><hr />

when i make PuGs i don´t care if someone has BiS gear,i just want to make sure they now what they are doing,so i look at they enchants and Gems, and only check the itemlevel to make sure no one with all 200s wants to get pulled through ICC.<br />
Gearscore reduced everyone to a number,this one can tell me ok,he doesn´t have best gear but look,he enchanted everything correctly,so he probably nows whats going on.</div></div><hr />

If you personally coded this AddOn, please, take the objection personally. If not, my apologies if I somehow implied it was directed at you personally. ;)<br />
<br />
And no, I never mean my apologies seriously. Just call me Gregory (as in House M.D.).</div></div><hr />

<br />
In contrary to GS it measures experience against gear<br />
In contrary to GS it compares gear, gems and enchants to spec and class<br />
In contrary to GS it gives you a decent view of the player you are inviting.<br />
<br />
And last but not least, this addon will destroy GS, which is a very, very good thing. <br />
<br />
And no, I have nothing to complain, my main is 50% 251+/264+ geared.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheBearkin</div><div class="date">2010-01-11, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This addon is different though as you can get a glimpse of how well the person will probably do before entering the raid. Yes, simply reducing everything down to a single score is bad as you can easily game the system (I keep an iLvl set at hand to mercilessly mock all those that herald the greatness of gearscore). This addon allows you to see something about the player; it condenses information that any competent pug raidleader looks for in an armory. What sort of gear is equipped/how is it enchanted/how is it gemmed/what sort of past experience does he have? You can tell a lot about how much care a person puts into his gear and glean a little if he understands his class. I've seen too many 5k+ GS dps that only pull 2k dps; one look at their gear tells me why.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, when you pug, you're taking risks regardless. Your group can be well geared but unless you're doing content that's 1-2 tiers below everyone's gear, success is really up in the air. I've raidlead an ICC10 pug where our top dps was a rogue who had 2 PvP pieces as well as a blue trinket. Mind you everyone was pulling 4.5-5k and for the most part behaved competently (all was cleared) but it was refreshing to see someone that actually had an idea of how to play his class correctly vs hunters that had over 1k GS on him being below him consistently on dps on every fight. Next week, I join someone's GS ICC10 raid where everyone had 5k+ and we were lucky that we even got to the gunship, it was that embarrassing. No that not usually normal but the point remains that when you pug, you're gambling with success. <br />
<br />
People don't want to take risks when pugging and who can blame them; no one wants their time wasted. GS, however, is not the answer to reducing risk. I have stubbornly refused to install GS out of principle; always relying on the trusted armory. I will be trying out this addon.</div></div><hr />

We don´t want prot Warriors to hit with 5K crit (lol...lol...lol). So we changed all dps related attacks to do NO damage but to generate threat. <br />
<br />
That day might come Blizzard. In def stance no damage only threat. <br />
<br />
I wait for that day when finally the 3rd specc is in game. The PvP specc. Without this specc you are not allowed to enter PvP. That simpel Blizzard. Think about it...</div></div><hr />

I meant the range of my gear. So to explain, 50% of my gear is ilvl 251 to 268. At least, I believe the revered ring from ICC is 268.<br />

Funny enough Blizzard did all the changes to &quot;let everyone&quot; see the content and no the limits are even harder than in vanilla, just set be the players.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem with the PvP side of Warbringer is that when you consider prot warrior versus mage (just as an example), there was nothing a mage could do to a well versed warrior<br />
<br />
I really, really, really loled at that. (Ofc mages were an example, its not like they are whining all the time.) I am not a pvp guy, (WoW would be the wrong game for me then) so i dont give a damn about PvP Balance. Blizzard had already ruined so much PvE by chaning things in favor for pvp. Come on everybody knows that the warrior is the weakest tank in wotlk by far and gets nerfed even more?<br />
<br />
Also i'm wondering: Blue post says &quot;They got no chance, so we need to fix it&quot; When i recall correctly PvP in WoW was always ment as paper, scissor, stone. Just ask warlocks what they do against rogues. Nothing, they just die and thats what blizzard said about it. Or when Ret where so completly OP Blizzard stated: Its not about 1vs1, we dont care. And now mages cry and blizzard nerfs the weakest tank ingame? WTF?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's easy to tell that you actually never gathered a pug-raid. If you had, you would know that it is completely impossible to judge someone's skill before you're actually trying a boss with them. And if the group fail instantly, it will most likely disband, wasting hours of work for you.<br />
<br />
The best you can do is check if they are properly prepared for the boss (gear, enchants, gems etc) and atleast have some clue about it (achivement).<br />
<br />
It doesn't tell you if they're retards who were carried, bought the account, etc etc etc, but then again, there's nothing better to go on, so you use what you can to try and make sure you get a pug together that might have a decent chance at killing bosses.</div></div><hr />

A mage was never one of those classes. At best, Warbringer allowed us to be more annoying in certain scenarios and close the gap every 10 sec or so. But any time i face a mage that is PvPsmart and of equal gear, although its much closer than it used to be, the mage typically comes away victorious. Now I'm not the most active pvp'er out there. In fact most of my pvp is done in the world, not arenas. But if I remember right, the story behind Warbringer was that it embodied the Prot Warrior as someone who wouldnt be stopped. Personally i dont feel like damage is too high, not when you stack us up against any other class/spec that can do decent damage. When Star's align sure, we can crit pretty hard with a Shield Block buff'd Shield Slam, but thats every 40 seconds and only if it crits. This all just sounds like a nerf without really good reasons. If you think Prot is OP because we're hard to kill...how about you dont attack the prot warrior til everything else is dead. See if that works out for you. With no back up, we're only slightly less helpless than other classes.</div></div><hr />

Let's just say that I've had fierce discussions with people about GS, with me being the antagonist and them being the protagonist. Their nr.1 argument usually was that I'd probably have sucky gear and that's why I'd be complaining. Hence, as an auto-defense system, I added a few stats. I'm not the epeen type that goes around bragging about his gear.<br />

Odd argument, the addon works through inspection. The only difference is instead of having to mouseover and check 16-17 slots, it does it for you and gives you summarized output. If you would rather spend time doing that 64 times for a 5 man then by all means, go for it. Personally, I'd rather get quick information.</div></div><hr />

I think you missed the part where we both count as antagonist. Check?<br />
No reason to be offensive, I understand that some guys use that as an argument against some players. But on the other side I ask myself: Why do you even respond to it? Seems like that doesn't fit with your comment above ...<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not epeen type that goes around bragging about his gear<br />
<br />
So WHY THE HELL do you respond? Really? If they use GS ingame as one of their addons you are safe in either way. So why?<br />
You couldn't care less, since your gear isn't bad. But you still think you have to prove it.<br />
<br />
Best thing is to ignore them. It's out of the question that GS is unnecessary.<br />
It wasn't in the past and it will not be in the future. Atleast for me.<br />

- Overcapping of stats with a hardcap, like hit, exp, arp? A 400+ hit hunter could get all green in this addon.<br />
- It only checks which tree your specced, not which talents. PVP talens should give big red warnings aswell, missing vital pve ones aswell. You can get away with having scattershot or not having GFTT as hunter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the problem right here. People don't even LOOK at what information is given to them. This person is most likely dual specced for tank and resto, obviously they were in their resto spec but still had their tank gear on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2010-01-11, 11:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really hate players that use addons like GS (and achievements) to *see* the skill of a player. Not going over all the crap that it is (hello &quot;I was dead the entire ToC25 run, but got the achievement!&quot; &quot;Hey, I have your 5k+ GS! In caster gear on my DK...&quot;), except that most of the time, the raid leader (the guy forming the raid) asking for those GS+Achievements doesn't even meet his own criteria, it's just an undergeared clown trying to get carried.<br />
<br />
But this one has the merit of just owning GS really hard (since I hate GS that much, watch it going down the toilet is awesome) and is way closer to what a raid leader should be looking at when trying to assemble a pug. Bad raid leaders that want to be carried will always find a way to be stupid (as long as they can find a way to &quot;give numbers&quot;), but the players who use GS because they saw others using and think it's the way will do better now.<br />
<br />
Still don't measure player skill with his class/spec... only that he won't try to use the wrong gear to achieve a stupid score or don't know how to copy/paste someone else's enchant/gemming.<br />
<br />
And how this addon is compared to GS regarding data SPAM? We banned GS from our guild (if a member wants to use it, ok, but if he shows up to raid with that thing on, he'll be invited to leave the raid after starting a raid with that more than a few times) because of the excess of data it throws up in the raid, leading to some DCs on people with not that good conections (that could handle the blizzard own spam on some fights, but also handling GS spam was a little bit too much and GS isn't necessary to raid).<br />
<br />
@warrior changes... lame... just lame... now they just have an excelent excuse to nerf anything by just saying &quot;it's not necessary for a raid&quot;. I don't think that they should balance 25man fights around having at least one shaman with hero/BL... so by their logic, they could change the spell anytime if someone complain about it for PVP.<br />
<br />
They said that they want to do things to make classes diferent from each other for a role (like 4 tanks, each one with their own way to do their job) and decided that prot warriors should be the &quot;very high mobile tank&quot;... now, they're not... lol<br />
<br />
The only problem with prot warriors was the fact that no class/spec should be allowed to not use PVP gear when PVPing. &quot;But there is no pvp tank gear!&quot; - and who said that there should be one? You're suposed to use resilience to do the &quot;defense&quot; job, the strengh is there for your slams and dps, huge crit, etc. Yes, they should change a few things to give some of your avoidance (dodge/parry/block) back while wearing a pvp gear, but in pvp you're there to be more offensive since there is no way to tank another player like you can tank a mob. Your abilities to save a partner are there (intervene, improved spell reflect, etc.) and they don't go away while using pvp gear.<br />
<br />
Mages complaining about getting owned at melee range? Go figure... I see melee players complaining about prot warriors block/parry their attacks way too much... and they're always attacking with the warrior facing them... lol you know that pve rule about attacking from behind whenever is possible? Yes... it does apply when fighting prot warriors... lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone answering 'Yes' needs to have their head examined.<br />
this is just what i was thinking as well. I have just started lvling my prot pally again, after lvling and gearing 4 other lvl 80's. After tanking every encounter todate with my feral druid, i thought it was time to put some better gear on my pally.<br />
<br />
My pally has about 31K health, with a mix of naxx 10/25 drops, and badge gear. <br />
<br />
Last night i did HC nexus and got booted because my gear wasnt good enough. What did they expect, ive not played him in six moths.<br />
<br />
Is this addon just an easyer way for people to laugh at my gear?<br />
<br />
So much for my lvl 78 Prot Warrior i wanted to gear up as well.<br />
<br />
IMHO this is a BAD addon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maerad</div><div class="date">2010-01-11, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, first of all - READ THE DAMN DESCRIPTION OF THE ADDON ... so many failanswers already...<br />
<br />
As example, the addon DEACTIVATES all kind of MSG during a fight or raid. No lag here...<br />
<br />
And please guys, try ONCE to get a good PUG together. I do that almost every week, for ToGC etc. pp. - I need 25 ppl there, how the fuck am I supposed to rate someone without knowing them? I don't know how much skill someone has, the only thing to prevent some bad players ruining the raid and fun for the other 20 ppl is to judge them by some kind of system. Until before I was using Gearscore, to get a hint how well their gear is, next would be the MANUAL check of enchantments, gems, talents etc.<br />
<br />
This is the ONLY hint I have to jugde if the player is ready for the instance/raid or not. Point.<br />
<br />
And _NO_ skill dosn't erase the need for a specific gearlevel for some instances. For ICC 25 (as example) you need around 140000 raiddps for festergut to beat the enragetimer (would be around 7500 dps/member with the tanks spamming around 3k DPS). There are some enemies you can't defeat with a min. of DPS or heal or tanking gear. I made around 6k DPS at kora 25 last time with a crap ~220 EQ and almost none enchants / blue gems. It was nice, but at any boss with some movement my DPS would be way too low.<br />
<br />
So you have to meet the specific EQ requirements of a raid/ini AND bring some skill. Well, I can't check your skill (ok, maybe ToGC HC 10/25 clear ... but those ppl won't pug) but I can check your gear, enchants, sockets, talents, stats etc.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with bringing some guys to a raid they don't know. But then they have to meet the min. EQ lvl for the raid, got everything enchantet, own bufffood, own flasks etc.<br />
<br />
They have to be willing to do the best they can.</div></div><hr />

So then the warrior's teammate (like a hunter) is just doing tons of damage while the target has no defenses.&quot;<br />

that we can stun after warbringer? welll the mage can still blink i cant stop him from doing that. i cant stop him from iceblocking either.<br />

It's different if you know the guy and if you do chances are he's on the same level of content as you are our you probably wouldn't take him anyway, so there's no need for such addons there. But if you do random pugs you get a lot of players, you didn't even know existed in the first place - so tell me how should I judge his skill and abilities? I can't thus there's the thing where all those gear scoring addons come handy. <br />
<br />
And frankly if we go by gear only, if a player has the latest and greatest gear, it means he's a good player, not always but pretty much most of the time - simply put, he probably wouldn't have that gear if he sucked that much. Sure there can be leechers who were dead on a boss and got the achivement but thats really pushing it now. Now everyone with good gear is a leecher and doesn't know how to play - and that the excuse most of the time from players who don't get into pug raids. <br />
<br />
Personally, when making a pug for the lesser instances (like VoA, Ulduar), I don't even check for gear or achievements, cause I have my core group of people who can do it even if the rest of the raid fails, so really, I don't bother even if they die all the time, I still let them in and distribute gear to them if they so desire. But for harder instances like ToC10HC, ToC25/HC, I damn right check for gear, cause I don't want to carry someone in Heroic or Naxx gear through all that, simple as that - I want the pug to be successful. And as said above, maybe it has happened twice that I had to replace someone from those raids, cause they were AFKing, but rest of the time, if the gear is good, the player also performs good.<br />
<br />
And I'm not saying it's not possible to do the raids with undergeared people, it certainly is, but I don't have the patience nor the will to do that, I want my runs to be smooth as butter.<br />
<br />
And then there's the way of faking achivements and gearscore that some people retort to, when they try to get into a pug. And while they think they have a right to do so, if this happens in my pugs, they wont ever get into a pug on the same server again, since the news spreads quite fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As example, the addon DEACTIVATES all kind of MSG during a fight or raid. No lag here...<br />
<br />
And please guys, try ONCE to get a good PUG together. I do that almost every week, for ToGC etc. pp. - I need 25 ppl there, how the fuck am I supposed to rate someone without knowing them? I don't know how much skill someone has, the only thing <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So you have to meet the specific EQ requirements of a raid/ini AND bring some skill. Well, I can't check your skill (ok, maybe ToGC HC 10/25 clear ... but those ppl won't pug) but I can check your gear, enchants, sockets, talents, stats etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Contradiction? We lived years without such add-ons. We still could do without them, especially when people are using them in the wrong way, like achievements.<br />
<br />
Can't wait for an addon which, as soon as invited to a raid, slams an IQ test in your face. If you fail the test you are instakicked out of the raid. Now that would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You lived years without such addons, cause there was virtually no pug going on. TBC introduced raid pugging and it was mostly Karazhan, Gruul and maybe some Mag. All basic entry level instances like Naxx 10 is now or even lower. People tried to pugg TK/SSC/BT and later SW but failed massively all the time. <br />
<br />
Now it's different. Everyone pugs all the raid content there is and as much as I hate to say it, there needs to be some player rating going on.</div></div><hr />

I would LOVE if Blizzard implements some kind of checkbox so other people can inspect your alts/mains achievements (or even gear). But as long as that is not arround, I'll gladly use EG. It functions EXACTLY like me looking up someone on the armory, but quicker and more streamlined.</div></div><hr />

It's just a tricky thing to implement because it's very easy to cheat.<br />
<br />
It's 4 AM and I don't feel like posting a detailed list, suffice to say you will not be penalized for being a newly leveled 80 or somebody who took a 6 month break from the game. As long as you gem, enchant and make correct gear choices the addon will not red flag you. I'm the first one to admit that the detection is not perfect and it will sometimes flag items incorrectly (Although rarely), if it turns out it flags something wrong then send a ticket in at http://www.wowace.com/addons/elitistgroup/tickets/ and it'll be fixed quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This addons seems to be going in the direction an addon like gearscore SHOULD be to be usefull. But I still see points that are not taken into consideration yet. <br />
- Overcapping of stats with a hardcap, like hit, exp, arp? A 400+ hit hunter could get all green in this addon.<br />
- It only checks which tree your specced, not which talents. PVP talens should give big red warnings aswell, missing vital pve ones aswell. You can get away with having scattershot or not having GFTT as hunter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hard caps are not likely going to happen, there is no good and efficient way to get specific stats without large libraries and a lot of ugly code.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the problem right here. People don't even LOOK at what information is given to them. This person is most likely dual specced for tank and resto, obviously they were in their resto spec but still had their tank gear on.<br />
<br />
<br />
............................<br />
<br />
That's an example that is very specifically setup to be wrong, it's my character.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Still don't measure player skill with his class/spec... only that he won't try to use the wrong gear to achieve a stupid score or don't know how to copy/paste someone else's enchant/gemming.<br />
<br />
And how this addon is compared to GS regarding data SPAM? We banned GS from our guild (if a member wants to use it, ok, but if he shows up to raid with that thing on, he'll be invited to leave the raid after starting a raid with that more than a few times) because of the excess of data it throws up in the raid, leading to some DCs on people with not that good conections (that could handle the blizzard own spam on some fights, but also handling GS spam was a little bit too much and GS isn't necessary to raid).<br />
<br />
Which is what it's supposed to do, it very specifically does not reduce people to a single number or correlate everything to skill. Because the addon can do nothing more than give you the odds of someone being good or bad.<br />
<br />
Addon communication is very light, the only times it sends comms automatically is when someone first zones into a 5-man and asks in guild to see if anyone has notes on the people you are grouped with. It will also send comm if somebody requests your gear (or you send your gear to someone), but those are both user initiated actions.<br />
<br />
For people who don't want any communications at all they can disable the entire comm system. It's specifically designed with not spamming the addon channels in mind.</div></div><hr />

How did you manage this? For myself my main has done it in a good (arguably the best on realm) guild. So when I recently found that due to limited tries, I was left with tons of free time, I leveled up my shaman (which I'd played in SWP) to get my healing fix. <br />
<br />
It was very simple for me to get boosted by my guild and never got kicked from a heroic run, and over the last week went from T6 (2500GS) to blues (3100 GS) to epics (4300 GS) with very little difficulty. And for me, the GS addon was great so I could look at the tank and see how much healing s/he was going to need over the course of the run. I knew that for the first 20 or so heroics I was the one being boosted, but I never got kicked, and thankfully my old skill from TBC stayed with me and we never ran into trouble (except the first HoR Heroic I went on with guild alts) and now am comfortably healing in 10-man ICC.<br />

oh so we nerf scenario specific now. because small scale pvp isn't exactly about keeping the enemy at bay with stun or other things. I can't see how the spec is a problem when people prefer pve gear over pvp gear - that basically screams that something is wrong with the whole idea of having 2 different things. <br />

small scale pvp balancing will _always_ affect pve unless you come up with specific skill restrictions or a whole different set of skills.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to say, but you're wrong. First of all there were checks - from guilds. And you had something at hand, called prequest. And you could only raid with a guild - I remember some kara pugs, but almost nothing beyond this point. Everything else was 90% guild stuff, because you need good ppl with good gear, and you couldn't get the gear without a good guild.<br />
<br />
Now, you get a WAY more ppl playing the endgame content and you HAVE to judge them ... Mannoroth EU has around 10k hordies on it ... how am I supposed to say &quot;hey, this ones good and this one not&quot; if not with their gear, enchants etc.?<br />

No addon, Smart RL: &quot;So can I inspect you? Mmh you don't look extrememly well stuffed. WOW, all epic gems and perfect enchants and talents? You're an alt amirite?&quot;<br />
No addon, Stupid RL: &quot;LOLZ, u has no ahi and you're full 213 or lower, you're not comin, lawl.&quot;<br />
Addon, Smart RL: (Same as above, but faster and plus:) &quot;Hey! I got a note about you in my Addon. 4/5: certainly an alt, plays well above iLvL.&quot;<br />
Addon, Stupid RL: &quot;LOLZ, ur avrg is 205, go away!&quot;<br />

I downloaded Elitistgroup this weekend, and am certainly not going to remove it anywhere soon: it's an excellent tool to help you make go/no go decisions.<br />
<br />
What it certainly ISN'T is a spare brain for idiots. My best suggestion is: let the stupid struggle. A good RL knows alts exists and will adapt appropriately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They do have defensive CD's, but yeh I agree with what you're saying.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The problem with the PvP side of Warbringer is that when you consider prot warrior versus mage (just as an example), there was nothing a mage could do to a well versed warrior. The warrior carries a lot of stuns, silences, and then any attempt to root him is broken by multiple abilities. So then the warrior's teammate (like a hunter) is just doing tons of damage while the target has no defenses.&quot;<br />
<br />
So now this is an issue? But not when say a rogue and a mage can stunlock a target AND keeping his partners out of the game for like 10s while the mage freecasts? <br />
<br />
Locking someone out for 10s is different than locking them forever which is what a decent prot warr can do to a caster. + what Psilo said<br />
<br />
<br />
And then you guys complaining about mages is just ridiculous, mage was the best possible example GC could have used, if a frostmage can't kite a prot warr, who cans? Or you think you should be unkitable? Currently you're like a hunter without the LoS/deadzone issues and with way more CC power than hunters.<br />
If you can't figure out prot warr is the most OP spec atm, you're hopeless.</div></div><hr />

With the millions of frost nova's they had a good mage would not let a warrior get close.<br />
<br />
Now prot warriors get warbringer to be abit more ffective. we now dont get stuck in frost nova's not alot atleast. the table's are turner after alot of years and mages are QQíng their eyes out. druids cry caus they cant root effective anymore. and blizzard is nerfing us back but is it really needed? Without warbranger we will be the guy sitting in roots and frost nova's for an eternity again. yes we got spll rflect but we do need rage for that.<br />
<br />
and the thing i have seen is mage's adapting to this problem by staying in range of charge. That way i cant hit him but i cant charge asswell Frost nova is effective again..<br />
imo its just alot of QQ from whiny little 12 year olds wich cant kill a class wich they previously could, and still can if they play well enough.<br />

Also even if Blizzard somehow made this information available on request, i don't think that flagging someone bad based on a hardcap is that fair, you can easily be over the cap without being nessecarily bad, i've had upgrades that put me way over hit and expertise caps, while still being better than my previous items, i admit that 400 hit rating is pretty high over the cap, but i also doubt you'll actually find many with over 400 hit rating.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard made this information available, and with the armory i don't see why not, through inspection then it should only trigger for gems/enchants, and within a certain treshold as it simply doesn't pay off to use, for example, a hit or stat/hit gem over the existing stat gem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every class has its counter, warriors' counter is mage. When a warrior can counter a mage then he shits all over every other class, how is that fine? Imagine if warlocks could counter warriors? And it's not like this nerf will make prots stand no chance against mage teams, they are just removing the root/snare break part of the talent.<br />
<br />
Also it's impossible to balance around 1v1, the game is being balanced around 3v3 as it should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless, I'll try to answer: I don't have a lot of experience playing a Warrior and almost none in PvP, so I can only say what it feels like as the caster.<br />
<br />
Going against every other melee build there is generally a way to open up some space and then figure out a way to counter them. The thing about Prot Warrior is that not only can they close the gap in an instant, once they get there they stun the Mage and aren't slowed from Frost Armor (other builds are). You brought up Ice Block - which is an emergency button and not an escape mechanism - and you're 1 GCD away from shattering it anyhow. You also mentioned Blink - which is useful against every class except Warriors and the occasional Druid. This would be recoverable if there weren't such a flurry of abilities that further make the caster defenseless.<br />
<br />
Unlike a sap, poly, fear, etc... incoming damage is not going to interrupt or lessen the Warrior's control on the casater. That is part of the difference - the Mage is simultaneously controlled, silenced, and defenseless - so even if the warrior isn't putting out tons of damage, they are creating a situation where the caster is a sitting duck... and we're not talking about a team working together to coordinate their lengthy CD's.<br />
<br />
In other words, the Prot Warrior's COMBINED abilities turn the Frost Mage (for example) into a target dummy. It's okay if a class can crowd control, stun and silence enemies, free themselves, AND do damage... but being able to do all at practically the same time is what one might call... OVERPOWERED. I don't like using that word, but that's what this is about. You might not feel OP on your own, but in conjunction with another player that doesn't even have to coordinate with you, there isn't much the caster can do once they have used up their 1 emergency CD.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the Warrior class has 1 tank spec and 2 DPS specs and they are all melee melee melee. When somebody refers to the tank spec in PvP as &quot;biting the dust, like we always do&quot;... I think they lose a bit of credibility considering the other options available to them that are so closely related.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you take the problem to 1on1 (or even 2v2) then you'll just have to accept it and move on. The game isn't balanced around 1on1 (or 2v2). And every class/spec have (or should have) at least one counter in that scenario. A mage (better yet, a frost one) should be happy to own almost everyone else except the prot warrior. Prot Warriors are fine in BGs (guess what? It's what a game like wow is better suited for pvp action) or even 5v5/3v3.<br />
<br />
As you alread pointed out &quot;you can't have it all&quot; mages...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jamdawg</div><div class="date">2010-01-11, 12:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things I'd like to add for the discussion.<br />
<br />
I have a macro that inspects people and gives me their average item level. When I use the random LFG tool to get my 2 frost badges per day, as soon as I enter the instance I pop the macro on each member of the party. Most of the time people are average item level 199-220. At first, I was a little upset that I was &quot;carrying&quot; the other people, however I've come to terms with it, and simply don't care what the other people's gear is. I just go through the instance and collect my badges.<br />
<br />
I've had similar success with groups with 220+ average item level and &lt;220 average item level. So gear really doesn't matter, (to a point)<br />
<br />
I understand when people don't want people extremely (item level 200) undergeared wanting to do ICC or something, but requesting rediculous requirements like a 5k+ gearscore to do ToC 25 normal is just silly. ToC 25 normal can easily be done with item level 213 gear. A good player who is gearing up will outperform someone who's been carried through places and doesn't play well.<br />
<br />
I don't mind someone using gear score (or this other mod) to get a &quot;feel&quot; for the person's gear. Like I said, as long as the person isn't severly undergeared, then let them go, and decide after you play with them if they can keep up. It's as simple as that.<br />
<br />
I downloaded this mod and loaded it on my main to see what it does, and I was pretty impressed actually. I like the option to see what raids they've completed before.<br />
<br />
In my experience, the only people who use GS as a determining factor in getting in a raid are random people I've never heard of, and are in guilds I've never heard of. I have yet to see anyone that is in a steady raiding guild ever use GS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because spellcasters have problems bypassing armor right?<br />
<br />
As a melee with mostly physical damage attacks, so, heavly impaired by their huge armor, I have no problems to bring their HP down...<br />
<br />
Key words there: Melee/Physical/Armor<br />
<br />
Again... forget about 1on1 and move on... go pwn all the other classes (and other warrior specs) like usual.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is also what I'm thinking. For many players that have all the uber gear and achievements on a main, they probably aren't doing a lot of PUG raids on that character which is the one that SHOULD be referred to in order to show their competency.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, there is no way to link any connections between a main and an alt even on the same account on the same server.<br />
<br />
What if players could link from an alt to prove they cleared 25-man Ulduar before patch 3.2 (for example)? THAT would be a nice addon.<br />
<br />
<br />
The main problem with showing the players characters is that it could be a privacy problem. Some people don't want to show who they're are when they're playing an alt, others like to show (or e-peen) all the way.<br />
<br />
The only thing that could be done is blizzard improving their own achievement system by showing something like &quot;this achievement was completed by this account&quot; when you're in a character that doesn't have it.</div></div><hr />

People don't even LOOK at what information is given to them. This person is most likely dual specced for tank and resto, obviously they were in their resto spec but still had their tank gear on.<br />
<br />
<br />
If someone is so stupid that he thinks that then why wouldn't he think the same if he just inspected him without the addon? It's exactly the same. The only thing that addon does is make a summary of the information. If your raidleader cannot see that then be happy he kicked you out of his fail raid.</div></div><hr />

Yes you might have done all the tactics and bossfights for all the bosses on your main tank.. but are you then a good alt healer? or dpser? Do you gem spirit as a holy paladin? Do you gem stamina gems so you can survive longer as a mage? I dunno..<br />
<br />
I like EG for that.. kinda shows you if you are on the right path or don't have a clue.<br />
<br />
If blizzard doesnt attach a flag for a main or alt character and then shares the experience along with it there is not really much about it you can do. Except tell the RL to check this and this name because he/she is my main character.<br />

But, i don't give a flying shit of pugging on my main. I don't ever pug except my random frost badges on my main.<br />
<br />
But my alts, specialy on my priest ATM that i finaly got to 80 this week end. How i'll enter raids. Nobody does naxx or even Ulduar anymore, so i won't get those achieve to ''prove'' how good i am based on that add on. Based on that Add on, achievement wise, i'm a freakin scrub on my priest, even if in fact i killed everything and anything that pugs might do.<br />

People have been asking for achievements when making a pug for a long time now. You couldn't link those achievements on your alt back then and you still can't now. You also can not show your achievements of your main with this addon, but that's the same problem you had before without the addon. So... i don't understand why you are QQing about this addon.<br />

On my druid I've done random heroics where I ended up doing 52% of the overall damage. As the tank...<br />

Hm but in order to get T9 gear you probably ran a lot of hero instances. And i bet you didn´t have a very high gear score at that time.<br />
So other people took you along. <br />
<br />
Now some general comments about players and hero instances:<br />
<br />
Anyway the real problem is that players who do run ICC (my priest is doing icc) want to do hero instances for their daily frost emblems.<br />
And the don´t want to be slowed down by lower geared people.<br />
<br />
(Personally i have a priest with T9 gear, icc weapons, icc ring respectfull ..... and a level 80 warlock who is at the moment collecting T9 gear)<br />
If i run a hero instance with my priest, i have to accept that sometimes i do have lower geared people in the group.<br />
<br />
If people have a problem with having some lower geared people in the group in Utgarde Keep hero, maybe they THEY DON´T HAVE ENOUGH SKILL FOR ICC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one of the best posts i have ever read.<br />
<br />
gearscore, achievements etc. etc. are all great things. the problem comes in when you get people refusing to take your alt to OS10 because you dont have the ach, or when they set a bar for a certain gearscore, you are 1 point below it, they refuse to budge yet you know you blatently wouldnt be the worst in the raid group.<br />
<br />
This addon sounds brilliant. especially the note and rating feature. This should stop whiners/leavers/ninjas etc. from causing to much damage.<br />
<br />
I play as a rogue, but from time to time i get pissed off with all the link ach crap that i just form a raid myself. This add-on will make it so so much easier. like others have said, it may not be the perfect judge of player skill, but its the closest we've ever been to it.</div></div><hr />

I wound up having to lead the damn thing because the people in their super shiny gear had no bloody idea what they were doing (and that includes the raid leader). Got lots of compliments at the end on how smoothly it went, and how the people without the best gear easily did their jobs because they actually know what the hell they're doing.<br />

It's just the usual problem with these things, they try and use some meaningless metrics to quantify skill, and it can't be done. What we'll see instead is lots of bad decisions being made on the basis of a number that a mod came up with.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this. I always love it when people tell me that I should upgrade my Holy Priest's Spark of Hope (219) to the trumph emblem trinket (245) because the score is higher.<br />

If you actually know anything about the class, you also know that trinket is garbage compared to the Spark for a Holy Priest. Unfortunately, nobody has yet created a mod that can assign a &quot;knows what the hell they're doing&quot; score.</div></div><hr />

Would you still be complaining if it was called &quot;QuickInspect&quot;? Because that's basically what it does, it shows you gear and pulls the raiding relevant achievements and statistics. Instead of looking through every single thing during inspect or on armory, it just flags pvp enchants, spirit gems on hunters etc. as &quot;bad&quot;. You can still mouse over the thing and find out what exactly is bad.<br />
<br />
You can also add personal rankings of players and notes. That's it, there's no automatic &quot;this person is this good/bad&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will hate this addon more than GS is because it seems to be a more legit way of quickly inspecting someone. Everyone know of GS's shortcomings, but people might not understand the limits to this addon.<br />
<br />
Cal me naive, but I expect most people joining for ToGC/ICC to know their class and the fights. Anyone can learn how to gem correctly, and can have achievements, and still suck.<br />
<br />
You use GS for Pugs where you can afford to carry people. The point is to quickly assess if people are far undergeared so you dont use more time for inspecting people than the time the raid actually takes. The numbers that GS addon suggests are fine. They provide a pretty nice minimum, and if people used that, there wouldn't be any problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinno</div><div class="date">2010-01-11, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While it may be the truth that you shouldn't judge players by their gear, how is pugs going to judge players by how they perform when they can't see it.<br />
<br />
Some raids also do require that you have some kind of gear to be able to do them, the more skill the less gear is needed.<br />
<br />
Then comes the problem, how do you measure skill? If you say that you just shouldn't then all pugs should just invite the first people that came, but when is that in anyway ever gonna be a succesful raid?<br />
<br />
Checking gear is necessary for checking if people know how to gear, know how to gem and enchant, if you don't think this is allowed then if you try to make a pug you will most surely fail in most cases.<br />
<br />
I'm against the use of GS as that only takes one thing into account which is the Item lvl of items, it doesn't show you how the people gear, however this addon is very different from that as it checks what gems and enchants they're using, if they have enchanted/gemmed all their gear, it checks out the spec, you can put in notes about the people so people may see if this is a good player or not.<br />
<br />
This is one of the best addons I've ever seen with so many options to you being able to see what a character has accomplished, although if it was possible I'd like to make it account wise, not with the gear but the experience base.<br />
<br />
So if you have done some bosses on one character and not the other it will still show on both of them, this would make the achievement linking system dissappear for most part, and people with alts would have less problems getting into raids, although the gear would still be accounted for the one character.</div></div><hr />

Bad Raid Leaders Will Still Be Bad, whatever the addon.<br />

If you PUG and you can't get in because the Raid Leader is Bad... everyone else needs the raid quest too.. you'll find another group.<br />

No, it's simply common sense. It's exactly why GearScore is a bad addon. It only calculates a number based on your average itemlvl and that's that. It doesn't look at achievements. It doesn't look at the gear itself. If I'd be wearing a leather thong of ilvl278 without any stats, it would still put me up there. It's complete and utter garbage, exactly because you get people with only badge gear. Badge trinkets that suck beyond believe.<br />

I personally, am not an achievement hunter. I friggin hate achievements. Is it ok that I never cleared Ulduar? Maybe you think it's not. I don't give a rats ass personally. We (10 people) cleared ToGC10 x50 and got a nifty achievement, but we just did it because it was actually a challenge.<br />

You might not think that GS is an issue, but face it. You will be getting exactly those people that you would like to avoid. People that artifically boost their GS just to get an invite. They'll swap back to their regular blues when they're in.<br />
<br />
EG however, that's a different deal. This addon seems to look at everything. Basically a be.imba.hu, but more advanced and online!<br />

My own personal GS has never been a problem, it's just ridiculous GS reqs to make up for that people dont play up to their potential. On our Festergut kill, I was between 95%-100% of my potential DPS that was simulated by Kahorie's DKsim. Yet, some people were doing half of mine or the rogues' damage.

I still cry a little inside when I see people with better gear than me failing so hard it's not even funny.<br />
<br />
I will use this addon myself just like I used GS. But I always used the GS reqs that the GS addon suggests (4500 for ToC25, 4200 for ToC10).<br />
The only diff is that now ilvl will be all, even though stasts might be subpar (haste for DKs for example) just for the ilvl.</div></div><hr />

You use GS for Pugs where you can afford to carry people. The point is to quickly assess if people are far undergeared so you dont use more time for inspecting people than the time the raid actually takes. The numbers that GS addon suggests are fine. They provide a pretty nice minimum, and if people used that, there wouldn't be any problem.<br />

I'm honestly surprised at how many replies like this I've seen. You either haven't checked what the addon does, or are too stupid to understand. <br />
<br />
If there is ANY way I can get &quot;better&quot; information about a player to help me from a PUG than what this addon provides, please let me know. If you've found some sort of addon that accurately marks every player with &quot;Good Player&quot; and &quot;Bad Player&quot; based on no prior knowledge of the person, then please, go ahead and tell me, and I'll use it. <br />
<br />
Or is the problem that you want people to armory, inspect and waste more time checking people instead of being able to achieve the same thing with one command? Other than that, the only reason I can think of for people complaining is that they want people to allow anyone that asks for an invite into their raids and expect it to magically work out perfectly.<br />
<br />
Stop being so stupid and looking for any opportunity to complain because you're not good enough to get into PUGs and expect people to just let you in with no reason to.</div></div><hr />

To all the people who go on about looking for skill and not gear when forming pugs, I've always wondered how you carry out your pre-raid skill checks and unless someone can tell me I see no problem doing a quick (educated) gear/achievement check if your not in the mood to wipe a lot (which I don't see a problem with, as there are so many people out there that complain about fresh 80s not getting into raids there must be a proportional also large amount of pug leaders who hold this view and thus don't achievement check. <br />
<br />
A intelligent person glances at a players gear to check they at least have the right stats and then uses GS to see that is probably going to match the level of the instance (this being the PuG forming method that doesn't take several hours of stat weight calculation and QI + Personality testing. If anyone can see anything wrong with what I've said please PM me and inform me of where I'm going wrong :P<br />
<br />
As as for this addon, it seems like a tool which in the right hands will save time and not block people who are READY for the raid in question, although there will of course still be those magical people out there with the powers to check a persons skill with there class before the raid, who, will likely find it the devils own creation ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reynard</div><div class="date">2010-01-11, 04:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to the Elitest Group addon, at the very least it's a million times better than rock-stupid GearScore. While it does provide an aggregate item level measurement, that's not the focus of the addon. It allows you to weed out people who don't have the skill, intelligence or drive to equip/gem/enchant themselves appropriately, and if they're not capable of that then it's very likely they're going to stand in the fire too. Knowing how to optimize yourself is a kind of skill too.<br />
<br />
That said, the &quot;Killed &lt;boss&gt; 1 time&quot; and &quot;Achievement = knowledge!&quot; aspects of the addon are kind of dumb - a slightly more advanced evolution of &quot;LINK ACHEEV PLZ&quot; that's just as bad. No, I haven't done ToC/ICC yet... on this character. I still know the fights.<br />

Basically I'm just going to use this to see if people know what's appropriate, not to discriminate against those not having BiS gear or awesome achievements.</div></div><hr />

Funny ... really funny ... I like the addon, because I can check the ppl for a 25 man pug in a way shorter time. Before I was checking them all manually, needing a fuckload of time with many ppl leaving the raid ...<br />
<br />
For some raids you need approciate gear AND skill, the first one I can check, the second I can't.<br />
<br />
So, now you tell me how I should use my brain to check the persons skill ...<br />
<br />
Let them DPS at a puppet? Go for an BG with 10 ppl? Do a hc run?<br />
<br />
My server alone has around 10k ppl playing on horde side ... how the fuck am I supposed to know everyone and their mother on it?<br />
<br />
If you don't like this addon, try to make an own ToC 25 or ICC 10/25 run, you will fail so hard without any kind of check. Last time we wiped at Kora for like 4 times. A quick GS check later I saw around 18 ppl out of the 25 NOT being prepared for the raid. THERE WAS A FUCKING ROGUE WITH 70 PVP GEAR....<br />

<br />
<br />
Well then, it's a bad example, as it is unlikely to happen. The majority of alts (all the ones in my guild at least) of end game raiders are in the same guild as their main. They usually are able to get boosted when they arrive on the scene as a freshly dinged 80. I played the one character since release of WotLK (my DK) and when 3.3 arrived I was able to go from freshly dinged to 4200 easily with my guild's help. <br />
<br />
So to say that anyone who has done every fight would have trouble gearing up their alt, is very far fetched and likely only to be very special cases. <br />
<br />
And if you are worried about this addon stopping you from getting into a raid on your alt because you can't prove you know the fights etc, it is a simple thing for you to log your main, have the Raid Leader inspect you and then log back. I'm sure that any RL would be happy to take my DK with 7k achievement points (very few in pvp) as guarantee that I know the bosses enough to go on my healer alt, with &lt;5k GS. If they are such asses that they won't, then I'd rather not be in a raid with them<br />
<br />
On the other hand though, very little of this would ever apply to me personally, as I can get into alt raids with my guild on a frequent basis, so would not find myself in this position.<br />
<br />
This addon would be great for those casual gamers that know their class, have actually tried instances before and even if they didn't clear it all, they do get some points for the stuff they did clear. Nothing will protect a player from the asshole Raid Leader who won't accept any excuse from you when one look at your gear or armoury will disqualify you anyway.<br />
<br />
What this WILL be good for is people who regularly pug with different (good) raid leaders, who have good comments will get places more often as it's possible to share out the comments if you chose.</div></div><hr />

This addon not bad, but still... with an Elemental shaman its hard to avoid a full gear without mp/5. Specially when you just gearing up. I guess the addon will be rank they as &quot;bad&quot; geared. And yes, you can use cloth pieces with hit but when you way over the cap, i would rather &quot;stack&quot; mp/5 than hit.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for warriros... no... chain charge and stun forever wasnt OP at all... really.<br />
<br />
<br />
MP5 isn't penalized for Shamans, the only time any caster class will get flagged for using MP5 is if they gem +MP5 (As in, Lustrous Majestic Zircon, not hybrids).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes... and, really, Yogg-Saron +0 is a requirement for Heroic HoL, amirite?<br />
<br />
You see, THAT is the problem with trying to automate things such as determining someone's skill and/or experience. What will you base it on? GearScore alone isn't enough and it never will be. But, factor in Achievements and you're looking at an inflation of what will be required for random Heroic X.<br />
<br />
We have seen that before in the past and there is very little reason to assume this AddOn will have any other result. On paper, it has its merits... but, it's old news. An old, boring and broken record. Which is why people should drop the notion they CAN automate someone's value.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, achievements themselves are not the primary way experience is determined, it's based off of kills mainly. The reason you see a percentage instead of specific experience numbers or achievements/kills without mousing over is to make something like that less common. It's all very specifically tiered out, yes someone can still say you need X experience in ICC 25 for T7 heroics, but this doesn't change anything, well except you can't fake achievements now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hm yes and no. I think the discussion is more about how the addon will be used and the gearscore situation.<br />
One of the problems with gearscore is that a level 200 item could sometimes be better (for your char) than a level 213 item.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You're absolutely right, which is why it doesn't try and use item level for anything more than determining the average quality (in relation to where it drops) of gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, this. I always love it when people tell me that I should upgrade my Holy Priest's Spark of Hope (219) to the trumph emblem trinket (245) because the score is higher.<br />
<br />
If you actually know anything about the class, you also know that trinket is garbage compared to the Spark for a Holy Priest. Unfortunately, nobody has yet created a mod that can assign a &quot;knows what the hell they're doing&quot; score.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what EG is already doing. Spark of Hope is flagged as being fine since it's appropriate for your class, it doesn't care that it's item level 219 and there are higher.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't condone this addon at all. While it gives more information that Gearscore does, it still doesn't tell me if a person can play or not. Also, outputting as &quot;Bad&quot; is just wrong.<br />
<br />
I will hate this addon more than GS is because it seems to be a more legit way of quickly inspecting someone. Everyone know of GS's shortcomings, but people might not understand the limits to this addon.<br />

You use GS for Pugs where you can afford to carry people. The point is to quickly assess if people are far undergeared so you dont use more time for inspecting people than the time the raid actually takes. The numbers that GS addon suggests are fine. They provide a pretty nice minimum, and if people used that, there wouldn't be any problem.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Everyone with half a brain knows GS only shows ilvl. People will accept this as a more accurate tool, and will therefore rely solely on the addon.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is really only one limitation, which are players who have to wear item X that is suboptimal because they got carried through an instance. For example, a healer who gets carried through a dungeon and replaces his blue quest cloak with a spell caster hit cloak. Which is an interesting issue that I've been thinking of.<br />
<br />
It's ironic that you say Gearscore is fine because it let's you quickly assess people when that's all this does and it already does what Gearscore does which is show average item level, it's just not the only thing it does. The point isn't to say a player is good or bad, the point is to tell you the probability that they are good or bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tried EG yesterday. I think it'll be good for Raids, but think it needs a 'Random Heroic' Mode. Since Heroics are about AoE DPS, AoE Threat, and Fast heals the specs/glyphs/gems are different than Raids. (Ex. Pallys don't spam Holy Light in Heroics, Rogues FoK all the damned time)<br />
<br />
I'm more looking for something to say 'This person isn't geming and enchanting spirit as a Paladin' <br />
<br />
The other thing I noticed this weekend is Recount has added a DPS/GS metric. THIS I like. Say what you will about GS, but this gives you a good idea of how people are actually performing rather than just their DPS, or their gear score. I'd much rather run with people who are consistently over 50% on DPS/GS than people who have insane GS and are running at 30% or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
It already tells you that a Paladin is gemming/enchanting Spirit. The only case I can think of are tanks who wear DPS gear so they can generate threat, or healers. I'll think about adding some sort of automated way of switching what is and isn't allowed.<br />
<br />
The gearscore/dps &quot;metric&quot; is just a percentage, it's DPS * 100 / Gearscore. It's horribly horribly flawed because DPS does not increase linearly and since Gearscore itself is based on arbitrary numbers on top of item level, the numbers tell you nothing useful.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eflow</div><div class="date">2010-01-11, 06:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think its kinda funny to see the drama around making instances ... <br />
<br />
people didnt get worse .... just a bigger slice of the casual/inexperienced players are stepping into raids/heroics. Its not because they CAN get into a raid, that they are PREPARED to do that. <br />
<br />
WoW has a great learning curse (quest complexities, zone difficulties, instances difficulties) that most &quot;new players&quot; are skipping. What we get is a bunch of 80s who are clueless on what to do. DKs is the most evident example. Its an easy class to tank (frost presence + gear .. dont even need to switch specs) and most people fail miserably at tanking with dks, not because of the class, but because they lack tank experience. They just jumped at ~60-80 instances without the basics (LoS, aoe threat, minimize incomming dmg, mobs positioning, etc etc), drop Death and Decay and think they are doing a great job. <br />
<br />
Problem is that people go dps for 79 lvls, at 80 they pick a &quot;role&quot; and expect other people to be gentle and kind to them while they are &quot;learning&quot; ... no, im sorry but fuck you. You had 79 lvls and dozens of &quot;playground&quot; instances to learn your class. If you dont know by now how your class works, go waste someone else's time. Gear Score doesnt mean shit simply because theres no skill in getting 232lvl gear now. Just a bit of farming. You need like 300 triumph badges to get nearly everything on ilvl232 (which is more than enough to kill the 1st 5-6 bosses from icc10, given the group has some skill), getting around 5 badges per instance, its ~60 heroics or ~30h played. My warrior alt was in full 219-232 gear within 26h played @80. <br />
<br />
But if theres an addon that tells me that a certain individual is less likely to waste my time and my e-gold (which consumes real time to be earned), yes, thank you very much. I do find fun to do stupid shit in raids with 9 other friends with alts for fun. But i dont find funny to run back to get my corpse for the 3rd time because ~2-3 out of 24 strangers are not smart enough to perform a simple task and wipe the raid. <br />
<br />
If not wanting to waste my time with strangers because they cant perform simple tasks, is being elitist .... then yes, i am elitist =D.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, achievements themselves are not the primary way experience is determined, it's based off of kills mainly. The reason you see a percentage instead of specific experience numbers or achievements/kills without mousing over is to make something like that less common. It's all very specifically tiered out, yes someone can still say you need X experience in ICC 25 for T7 heroics, but this doesn't change anything, well except you can't fake achievements now.For you (and Maerad) I will try and explain my objections to AddOns such as these - they promote prejudice.

Absolutely, it's definitely an issue. However, as someone mentioned earlier, the addon doesn't change this it just makes it easier. There are some plans to make it more obvious that someone should be looking at the experience in 5 mans not in raids for dungeons thought, see http://www.wowace.com/addons/elitistgroup/tickets/23-current-dungeon-feedback/<br />

Actually, this would be a good thing. People who recently hit 80 are far far more likely to be labeled as fine in a 5 man than you would with gearscore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What game have you been playing?<br />
<br />
When in the lifetime of WoW have you ever been judged on skill alone? Have you ever applied to a progression guild before?<br />
<br />
Your gear, how you gem enchant, etc is a HUGE part, along with your knowledge of the game, etc. But for people to sit there and get on their soap box and yell 'skill &gt; gear' are just usually the people with terrible gear and cheap gems.<br />

<br />
If you look at gearscore, there are inflection points (4k, 4.5k, 5k, depending on realm and what you're raiding) that people set as the bar. Above is good, below is bad.<br />
<br />
Since this addon basically takes that responability on (to an extent, there's still a score there), I think its success as a useful tool depends a lot on how accurate its &quot;pass&quot; or &quot;bad (#)&quot; is.<br />

How about putting a hard limit on +hit items? In the parameters, create a couple sliding scales: Number of Hit items allowed for healers / Number of DPS pieces allowed for tanks.<br />

Or maybe create an extra line in the box with talents and such stating the amount of &quot;maybe&quot; items<br />

So players are lead to believe that me running around in 2T8 was the poorer player when I had done the research for the class.<br />

I was a casual player up to patch 3.3 and don't have very good &quot;gear score&quot; or what you may call it, but I do my job very well in ICC25 and I'm glad about this. No addon can &quot;tell&quot; you that. And it never will. People tend to rate players by rate their gear ... I don't like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
An addon will tell me, that assuming both players are great players (ie: they know what they're doing), the player with a 5500 gear score, will beat out the player with a 4000 gear score. When you're a leader for a pug, the only thing you have to go off, is gear. You don't know if that person is a good player or not, with or without the mod. So what's your point? That being judged based on your gearscore is somehow wrong? Would you feel better about yourself if the person says &quot;Your armory sucks&quot;, instead of &quot;Your gearscore sucks&quot;? You would, if you were ignorant, because it's the exact same determination with the exact same outcome. <br />
<br />
Instead of looking at it from a raid member perspective, look at it from a leaders perspective.<br />
<br />
What do you do to determine if that person is up to par with the raid you are trying to form? You inspect them, or look at their armory. With, or without a mod, there has to be some factor that will tell you &quot;this person can come&quot;. This isn't a brand new thing since gearscore came out. This mod just sums all that information up into an easy to use interface.<br />
<br />
I just find it hilarious that being judged off your gearscore is somehow &quot;wrong&quot;, where being judged by your armory (like has been going on for years now), is somehow better. It's the same damn thing.<br />
<br />
There's obviously people who abuse it. If you're being denied by these people, you're probably better off not raiding with them anyway.<br />

Nope, there is a specific flag set for that enchant so it's allowed for all tanks. The parry/threat enchant is currently flagged as for tanks, but from checking in IRC it sounds like it's useless for everyone so I'll reflag it as a never enchant.<br />

I was thinking of doing some sort of relatively scale. A healer who is wearing primarily 200 items but has say a 230 level DPS cloak would be flagged as &quot;Yes this is bad, but it's likely an upgrade still&quot; whereas a healer who is using 230 items and wears a 230 DPS cloak would still be flagged as bad.

Honestly, you have to play the game again before you comment. My experience with the dungeon finder playing my main and an alt is that the decent players greatly outnumber the asshats. You're more likely to get the bad experience you're expecting with people looking for a premade group in the trade channel than people you see using the dungeon finder.<br />
<br />
There are good players who don't have high ilvl gear. The chances of finding a good player with their gems and enchants all wrong is virtually nil.

I will be the first to admit that there may be some prejudice in how I perceive the overall WoW community, I will give you that. But, you know as well as I do that cross realm PvE-ing (through the Dungeon Finder) lowers the threshold a great deal to behave like asshats.</div></div><hr />

Just to clarify - I am not trying to diss your work. I have not actually used the AddOn, I currently am not actively playing WoW. I am just questioning the attitude of people requesting AddOns such as these - if there was no one interested in an AddOn such as this, you wouldn't have coded it. So, there is a market for them. Which is what annoys me really. From a fellow coder's perspective - keep up the good work. Yes, I can make that distinction.<br />

<br />
Certainly, there's no magic here it's just a time saving addon, people have used addons that save you less time than this does :p. Personally I'd rather be able to quickly see what my groups have rather than manually checking 16-17 slots per person.<br />
<br />
If I expected everyone to love this, I'd be delusional!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My main concern with this addon is spam. I hate GearScore primarily for the pings it sends to me from anyone I group with who uses it, people in my guild that are using it, etc. I primarily do 25 man runs. The last thing I want is getting useless spam from everyone using these types of addons while I'm raiding. I've had to put several people on ignore simply because of their addon traffic. The problem with these types addon (and the possibility of alt tracking being added) is that it's affecting others who don't want anything to do with it. In fact, it's the very design of these addons to check other characters. <br />
<br />
<br />
There is very little communication, the only time it will send addon comms are when requesting notes when you first zone into a 5-man, which can be disabled. All comms are in whisper channel (except note requests), so if I request notes on you, everyone in my guild will whisper the data meaning most people won't see anything being communicated.<br />
<br />
All other communications are user initiated, and also over whisper channel too.</div></div><hr />

I think the point of this addon is to make that process easier by automating some parts of it. If you are putting together a 25 person raid, getting everyone to come to you for a gear check and manually inspecting their gear is going to be a bit tedious. Not to mention looking at their spec and possibly their achievements.<br />
<br />
As for people wanting to penalize people for being over the hit cap -<br />
<br />
The hit cap can be kind of tricky for some specs to juggle in certain gear situations. Sometimes a piece of gear is a clear upgrade, even though it puts them well over the hit cap. If you say &quot;Well, only penalize them if they are over the hit cap and have gemmed for it.&quot; that has problems, too. What if my next piece of gear is going to drop me back down to a reasonable amount of +hit? Should I re-gem twice just to satisfy this? I don't think that is reasonable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People have to realize add-ons like this one are tools, just like a hammer is a tool. The hammer won't be of any help if you don't work with it properly. Same with add-ons. If you expect the add-on to do all the work for you (i.e. if all you need to know is that 500 is higher than 300) then you're doing it wrong.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you use a tool like this one to view achievements, gems and enchants in a single, convenient window, then maybe you can quickly gather enough information to determine if a player has the knowledge that you deem required for whatever you want to raid.<br />
<br />
You will still need to play with someone to determine whether they are good or not. For example, I recently leveled a shaman (over the holidays). As soon as I hit 80, I specced elemental and grabbed whatever questing blues I had saved up for elemental gear. I had very, very bad gear but I still got around just fine in heroics. After 4 days at 80, I now have 2pc T8 and 2pc T9 as well as a few of the epic drops from heroics all the way up from Pit of Saron. Yes, it is mostly badge gear, but it is gemmed properly and enchanted with the right stats (even though sometimes not best enchant because the item is iLvl-200 and will be replaced fairly shortly) and I am usually doing very competitive damage in heroics. The only thing that an add-on can not (and probably will never be able to) determine is whether I am smart enough to not stand in a giant swirling blue vortex or not.<br />
<br />
In short, I think the add-on is a great step forward if used the way it's intended to be used.</div></div><hr />

You may understand the tactics from multiple perspectives, you may not, but the achievements on you Mage will show how good you can play your Mage. If I was leading a raid and could view the player's other characters' achievements I'd take them into account but if I think you're going to make the raid harder for everyone else on the character you want to join with (not good enough gear, lack of experience on that char, etc) then I won't invite you regardless of what you've done on other characters.</div></div><hr />

This. I hate GS, but EG would flag someone like this poster's new 80 elemental shaman as (mostly) good because he has the right gems and chants. An intelligent person can see then the person may be undergeared, but knows what he or she is doing. Hence any person saying &quot;QQ my alt can't get into raids cause of addons like this&quot; doesn't actually know what this addon does. In fact, this addon would more likely let your new 80 into a raid than GS, assuming you actually take the trouble to gem/chant correctly. And if you don't bother to gem/chant... what are you doing raiding? <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, nothing will replace intelligent thinking when forming pugs. Honestly, this addon simply condenses useful information into a easy to read format, nothing more or less. I don't buy any argument that says this addon is bad because it &quot;perpetuates stereotypes&quot; or some such. If the person using this addon misuses it, that is that person's problem, not this addon's (or the author's) problem. <br />
<br />
There will always be idiots who misuse tools, so what are we supposed to do? Not make more useful, convenient tools? According to that logic we should never produce knives, heaven forbid an idiot misuses it to slice people instead of spread butter. As the quoted person succinctly summaries: &quot;In short, I think the add-on is a great step forward if used the way it's intended to be used.&quot;</div></div><hr />

No addon can &quot;tell&quot; you that. And it never will. People tend to rate players by rate their gear ... I don't like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's impossible for you do as much DPS as someone with gear good enough to do the instance, all other things being equal. You cannot deny that.<br />
<br />
And why the hell would I test out every player that whispers me in a wipe, checking to see if they know what they're doing? That's a huge waste of time and the rest of the raid would never stay.<br />
<br />
So... basically I have no knowledge of how every pug performs, so I regard them all as equal, except for the information that I DO have (gear, achievements). Equally bad I mean, because the average player WILL fail.<br />

I think you're wrong about this addon. It's not a gearscore-alike, and in fact it solves many of gearscore's issues.<br />

Fresh 80s who want to raid should do so with a guild first. It's a more accepting and nurturing environment. Doing your first raids with a pug are just going to get you disliked.<br />

for instance, someone with 200item epics/blues rarely will do 4 or even 5k dps. in ICC25 festergut the raid needs around 7.5k dps. so if your pugging icc25 u want ppl to do that kind of damage.<br />
<br />
What Gearscore addon doesnt show is that some items like Greatness deck(which is itemlevel 200) is best in slot for alot of people untill toc25. aswell as some other items have low itemlevel but is so good and effective that there's no need to replace it. im currently at 5.3k GS with libram and 1 trinket (paladin) itemlevel 200. because those are by far the most effective i can get my hands on at the moment.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if somewhere in the 13 pages this was suggested, but I was thinking the best and most productive use of this addon would be in forming repeat pugs. I run 3-6 pugs on my various toons each week, and would LOVE a way to track the bads and the goods. What I would love to see in this addon is first TABS, seperate each palyer based on the eg snapshot as melee, ranged, healer, tank. then within the tabs have them ranked based on first MY rating...I am anal enough to set a score for each person in the raid, and comments, then on average score(same as the red/yellow/green for instances) in the list with the top profiles in green and then scaling down to red for bad gear and even lower as bad personal rating.<br />
<br />
This would save so much time its beyond estimation. People know I run successful pugs, so they come in droves, an easier time sorting would be SO clutch. Don't know if any of those things are even reasonably doable, but man this is a great addon that begs to be really amazing tool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see where you are coming from, but I think you are missing the point - This addon gives a much more nuanced view of someone's gear, such that if someone won't invite you for your gear being &quot;bad&quot; it doesn't really matter if they manually inspect you (time consuming) or use this addon.<br />
<br />
If you are putting together a 25 man PUG for something, how are you going to determine who to invite and who to decline?<br />
<br />
- Gearscore? That is 10x worse than this addon.<br />
- Achievements? Problematic for a lot of reasons.<br />
- Manual gear check and a 10 minute interview? Too time-consuming<br />
<br />
Putting together a raid is an imperfect process - you are going to invite some bad players and probably not invite some good ones regardless of what you do. An addon like this basically just makes the process less time-consuming and maybe a little more accurate. Are people going to misuse it? Probably. But if not for EG, they'd be misusing gearscore or manual gear checks or whatever other method they use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Shouldn't you base it on the same thing you would if you manually inspected someone? Sounds like a fairly simple question to me.<br />
<br />
IMO, you should break down how good a player is into about 4 catagories.<br />
<br />
1) Gear level, this is essentially what GS does right now. Although I like the EG way of displaying the average total ilvl instead of arbitrary numbers that need a key to be deciphered. But it does the same thing, averaging 213 clears you for Ulduar 25, averaging 226 clears you for ToC 25, averaging 245 clears you for ICC. It's not unreasonable to require gear from the previous tier of content to be ready for the next one (GS actually does this in the suggested level of gear for content part but people always ignore it). Before you QQ about greatness or an idol that's a lower ilvl but technically better, remember that it's only 1-2 pieces out of your entire gear set, it's not going to make much of a difference in your score anyway.<br />
<br />
2) Gems and enchants. This is a trickier thing to do. Not because an add-on can't measure it but because detailed info on 30 classes and specs needs to be included in the add-on with up to date relevant theorycraft. It's easy to see some things like gemming hit while over hit cap but many other things are class dependent. Namely, some melee classes find it necessary to have the expertise cap while others don't, some set bonuses change how you gem while others don't (2pcT9 ret making str/crit in yellow sockets better then just pure str, but any other situation makes 20 str better). All melee classes should be using 21 agi/3% crit damage as a meta (except enhancement shaman). There's a ton of rules that would need to be involved and you can't expect one person to know exactly how all 30 classes work.<br />
<br />
3) Talents. Can easily be evaluated based on the number of deviations from the standards specs. Obviously, where &quot;filler&quot; points go wouldn't effect this score. Bigger amounts would need to be subtracted for missing essential talents then just missing good talents.<br />
<br />
4) Experience. Just look at how long it took someone to complete any given content after it was released. If they didn't clear ToC until ICC was out, bad for them. If they managed to do most Ulduar hardmodes before 3.2 was out, good for them. If they have zero raid experience but have full 232-245's, you've got a badge scrub on your hands.<br />
<br />
And don't bring up the mains vs alts thing. I don't care if you've dps'd this before on your main. That doesn't mean shit if you're signing up to tank it. I don't know if you know how your different classes interact with a boss. Maybe you need to dispel on certain fights but your main isn't a dispeller, maybe the melee need to do a dance on one fight where the range are stationary. No one cares what your main has done if you show up on an alt, if you want to bring your toon with the experience, then that will boost your score.</div></div><hr />

nope =) it's easier to whine and whine and whine till class X gets nerfed. Anyways gg for the nerfcriers now my warrior tank falls behind even further!<br />
<br />
seriously blizz needs to compensate warriors in any means... for the lack of balancing in Wrath. First it was DK / Pala / Druid now it's Pala / Druid. DK's are as squishy as warrs atm -.- haven't seen 1 dk tank in raid for quite a while<br />
<br />
What surprises me the most is the poor post from blizz;<br />
<br />
So then the warrior's teammate (like a hunter) is just doing tons of damage while the target has no defenses. <br />
If you know the dmg is sickening high on other classes why don't u nerf them? The warrior itself isn't lethal or w/e it's just freaking annoying preventing you from casting. Just like a rogue does except worse =)<br />

Yes, but how do you gather all of that when putting together a PUG raid? For up to 24 people, at that? Most of these people are total strangers to you - you haven't played with them before, don't know them, and have no experience with them. You have no way of knowing someone's overall &quot;feel&quot; until you have actually done something with them. Do you just invite anyone and hope for the best?</div></div><hr />

I'm a fairly quick judge of character. It's those limits I mentioned. I need basically just 1 or 2 responses from someone to have a fairly clear picture on someone's personality. Besides, I never PuG raids. Just 5 mans. For, amongst others, this very reason. Even though I am a fairly quick judge of character, it still takes time to find 24 people. Even more time if I go with high GS people that turn out having a piss poor attitude. Because, solid as their DPS or such may be, they're going the way of the dodo as far as my raid is concerned.<br />
<br />
Again, I play this game to have fun. For some, that fun is to be had with actual progress raiding or such. For me, it's a bit more global. Sure, I like to progress through a raid instance with some degree of success and expedience. But, if that means having to settle for people with a chip on their shoulder and bloated ego's, I prefer passing on the raid completely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no rush to it for me really. I never deluded myself with the illusion I have it in me to be a progress raider. I'm simply not patient enough with people to go that road. I cannot help myself but end up being very nasty to people that annoy me. So, I settled for a casual, laid back approach in which I surround myself with people that do NOT annoy me. Even if that means having to settle for a slower progression.<br />

If you are judging how well someone will perform and how easy you can get along with them based on one or two /w responses, you are being even more unfair and inaccurate than any of the addons. Quick judge of character != good judge of character.<br />
<br />
Either way, this mod is more or less irrelevant for 5 mans. If you are in it for the quick badges, just use the random LFG tool and don't worry about the occasional sub-1k DPSer. If you want a slower-paced run with nice people, go with guildies or build a friends list full of like-minded people. If you want achievements, do the same.</div></div><hr />

You could get away with judging someone off a sentence or two if you met them in real life - body language and other nonverbal cues tell us a lot, especially if we are trained to look for them. You don't get the benefit of those in-game, however. I'm not saying you specifically cannot pass judgment based on a few responses to basic questions in the game, I'm saying *nobody* can. There are a handful of cases where you can tell right off the bat someone is likely to nerd rage the entire time, but outside of that, I'm pretty skeptical that you can make any reasonably accurate judgment of character, much less playing ability.</div></div><hr />

If you haven't tried to put together a PUG 25 man raid, you don't know the effort required. To me, the people who have issues with this or GearScore are the people who don't actually use it as a raid leader should.<br />
<br />
For example, I try to form PUG raids for ToC/Ulduar/VOA 25 quite regularly. For sure, I would prefer a person who can play well and has a good attitude - but there is no way to tell this from a 'DPS DK LFG ToC25' post, no matter how well you claim that you can judge someone's skill and personality from 25 characters of pink text. So the next best thing is to inspect each player individually, check every slot for the right enchants and gems; this also require being intimately familiar with 30 different specs and the way they need to gear. For a 25 man raid, this means I need to armory at LEAST 24 different characters, coming closer to 50 for a typical raid. All the while the pugs I invite are complaining 'hurry up i gotta leave soon' 'why dont u get more heals' 'gogogo' and leaving. 50 minutes of inspect time, PLUS the time it takes to get the right balance of classes/tanks/healers.<br />
<br />
This addon will be a godsend as it will do the armorying for me instantly, it won't require me to know the best stats for a Shadow Priest, and it will tell me that a person knows how to gear (even if they're not geared yet.) Your alts will BENEFIT from this addon far more than they were excluded by gearscore.<br />

Warbringer was introduced in 3.0, and has always had the root breaking ability. The first dual i had in 3.0 was against a frost mage from my guild. Guess who won then, and why did it take so long for Blizz to decide this wasn't fair?<br />
<br />
I also loved it on BT trash on the way to Gorefiend, and also in SW trash with the stupid mage mobs who blinked everywhere. This really has more uses in PvE than many of you realize. It takes a PvE warrior to know where it will be missed, and you'll be hearing the tank call for Cleanse a lot more over vent. (If they aren't already a paladin or druid or death gripping DK)<br />

The thing blizzard is doing is a double nerf. They nerf shieldslam damage (most likeley on a large scale) and they nerf warbringer not being able to use during roots.<br />
<br />
So what will happen is when a warrior reaches you he doesnt have enough power anymore to do some hurting. but he cant reach you anyway because of warbringer root nerf. <br />
<br />
GG blizzard.<br />
<br />
The more decent solution would be to make intercept on the same cooldown as charge (making intercept useless but hey we can still charge out of every snare evry 15 secs (druids will still laugh in your face then tho) or remove intercept from being able to use in all stances. (wich will be less effective but it will make us stancedance) making other protskills unusable until GCB's cleared.<br />
<br />
actually scratch that last part. i think the decent solution would be removing intercept from warbringer. we still can do both charges then but only 1 breaks roots and snares. I think that alone would make warriors less OP as the QQ'ing mages make us believe.</div></div><hr />

There's a big But to my opinion though..<br />
<br />
Our realm started to realize this slowly and nowadays, the only way pugs happen really is the &quot;come to eventide for inspect&quot;-way, which is perfectly fine by me and the method I use whenever I want to start a pug. (The great thing about doing this manually as opposed to having an addon do it for me is that I actually get to talk to people so I know whether their level of communication is beyond 'sum plz!1'). Point being that people aren't all dumb. They tested gearscore, found it, apparently, fail, and moved on to more time-consuming but also more fair methods. There'll always be the lazy scrub who demands achievements and skyrocketing gearscores - the good part about that is that you know right away this person is clueless and going with his/her pug is likely to be a waste of time. This addon is less retarded than gearscore, and sure it'll be misused (as everything, it can and will be misused), but if people are going to judge people based on achievements and retarded scores anyway, rather have them do it in the smartest way possible, which is open their eyes to the more important facets that come to judging a person's worth.<br />
<br />
No method to judge a player's worth will ever be foolproof short from just taking someone and experiencing first hand how good he is, and we cannot turn back this trend that has been developing during LK, so I for one applaud this attempt at smarter player-judging. (Moreover, even Blizzard is supporting the trend with their recent LFG system, so we're really screwed (the system is still refusing to accept my boyfriend's newly dinged spriest to HOR because his gear would be too low; however, he was second on the dps meter in ICC10 today with 4.5k. This is how much gear says about a person)).<br />
<br />
<br />
@ Kharay1977, who's so worried about going back to WoW in this climate of gear checks. On our battlegroup (Raserei/Frenzy if I'm not mistaken), we have a severe lack of tanks. I never ever experienced a group kicking a tank, aside from one time in POS, a tank who was hopelessly clueless. I'd personally heal a retridin willing to equip a shield (in fact, that would be more fun than healing 40k protadins from my perspective). My hunch is that you won't have as many issues as you expect. Another reason for this is that the Kick feature isn't as free as you seem to think. You cannot be kicked within the first 15 minutes of the instance. By the time 15 minutes have passed, you're already halfway through the heroic and there'd be no point in kicking you.<br />
<br />
(That said, I have no respect for healers who expect to AFK through an instance just because they will only accept supergeared tanks. For example, today I did VH on my resto druid, the tank was a 40k HP I can't even remember what class, and I landed about 10 heals in total, most of which was overheal. I actually resto-dps'd. Healers who refuse to heal tanks with 30k are the ones who expect to be carried. Get rid of them instead of the tank. (Edit: In restospect I think this was a paladin, and I realize avoidance matters, not just HP, but I don't usually check people's armories when I go to randoms. Just to be ahead of the tanks bashing me.)</div></div><hr />

and, beside, it really helps to help friends/guildmembers to get their gear improved, much faster then checking the Arsenal/looking at each piece on its own, thinking a while about it, then commenting)<br />
<br />
The BIG issue i see with it, is, the dumbasses, which seem to make up 90% of the community, will kick/flamme people for stuff like pvp head enchants &quot;Because teh addonz say itz NOOBGEAR!!111lolol&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are better enchants for PvE gear then PvP enchants...so if someone is exalted with the Sons of Hodir for example, and they have a crappy pvp enchant on their shoulders...or if they are exalted with the Kirin Tor or Wyrmrest Accord, and have a crappy head enchant...then yeah they arent too smart and its good that the mod picks up on it. <br />
<br />
As far as the addon is concerned, i have always and will always steer clear of Gearscore...and im relieved that this addon doesnt focus on that crap. I like that it shows everything thats actually important quickly. <br />
<br />
I am going to try this addon, and see how it works out. '<br />
<br />
And just in case people missed it, which ive seen tons of posts indicating to me that some cant or dont want to read....<br />
<br />
THIS ADDON ISNT GEARSCORE. It actually takes a bit of motorskills and brain function to look and see what the other player is doing with his/her gear, spec and gems rather then just having a crap mod shoot a number at you. READ the mod description.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh, it's definitely not going to cause your latency to jump, it's essentially impossible for an addon to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, I'm having this exact problem as well. I downloaded the add-on today and tried it out, and I immediately noticed the huge spike in latency when I started inspecting people. Even when I joined a cross-server group on a dungeon run, I inspected two of the party members and my latency spiked to 2,000-3,000 moments later. It went on for a good minute or so, too. Before I knew it, the group vanished from my screen and I realized they were three pulls into the dungeon. They probably thought I went AFK.<br />
<br />
The problem didn't exist before I installed the add-on and it went away as soon as I removed the Elitist Group add-on. I re-enabled the add-on again and the problem returned. I removed it one last time and the problem went away. Do you think perhaps it and another add-on (I only use a few.. recount, omen, gearscore, some CTmods, SCT, DBM, Rating Buster, Chatlink, and Rankwatch) aren't playing nice together? Something is definitely up because when I'm not using Elitist Group the problem doesn't happen. But when I do use it, it does.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vespian</div><div class="date">2010-01-12, 08:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've been using EG yesterday afternoon and I personally didn't experience any latency issues. However, this could indeed be due to addons not working well together. But than again, I have an 80mbit connection with 20 mbit upload so I don't ever really notice anything strange with my connection. I can happily have 4 torrents running and not even notice a slight bit of it.<br />
<br />
The addon itself is pretty close to perfect imho. It doesn't just show itemlvl, it shows everything relevant. Everything you want to know. For example, Yesterday I inspected some raidmembers and found out that one of them had 0 enchants, simply by using /eg on them. You immediately see the red &quot;enhancement ....&quot; below the item, which in this case was true for roughly 10 items. In that situation you know it's best to kick. In this case it was a PUG ICC25 of which I became a leader after being invited last and the member was a guildie, so I didn't kick, but when I'd do the invitationals, that's one person that does not enter my raid.<br />
<br />
Needless to say we wiped 4 times at around 14% on Lady Deathwhisper, because people constantly died to ghosts &lt;3<br />
<br />
Anyhow, the addon has it's own database with notes, it shows gear, enchants and gems. It shows achievements and completion percentages for dungeons and on top of that it rates the experience the player has with the dungeon. I'm sceptic about this last part, because ICC is cut up in pieces and officially I've done only 11% of the content, which makes me inexperienced, but I do damn well know the proper tactics for each (currently available) fight.</div></div><hr />

So you will turn down the BiS geared player because you know that all BiS geared players are overly-critical, wreck morale and quit after one wipe? This addon will be great for you then. You can find all the people with BiS gear and kick them from your raid, since you don't want that type of person in the group.</div></div><hr />

Any gearscore addon is extremely &quot;chatty&quot; in the way it gets &amp; processes information. I can see why you may want the addon for pugs, but i certainly hope you never hurt your guild runs by having crap like this installed - the back channel chatter is enough to flood people out and dc them if they don't have a fantastic connection. Our guild is multi-national so its more important people don't run these mods that add more latency than anyone needs.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents<br />
<br />
you can install performance fu or something similar and see your network traffic spike as well as MiB of mod usage go crazy when you use these &quot;inspection&quot; or &quot;ranking&quot; mods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can duplicate it easily, disable Gearscore and see if it resolves itself. If it doesn't, update to the alpha at: http://www.wowace.com/addons/elitistgroup/ my guess is it's because Gearscore or another addon is sending a lot of inspection requests.<br />

<br />
If only your two cents were accurate? Gearscore might be chatty, but the only issue in EG is that it doesn't hard disable inspection while in combat. Beyond that it does very little that isn't user initiated.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
no addon will be able to tell you someone performance or skill. but there is a such thing as being appropriately geared for the content youre doing. people who &quot;lfg 6000 GS naxx 10&quot; need help, yes. thats out of line. but appropriate gear for these raids is a nice thing, and this helps. it also helps to see if someone is dpsing in half pvp or tank gear. gearscore failed about making this easier, boiling things down into an unintuitive and meaningless number. this actually lets you see what they have, to help build the group intelligently and quickly. im sorry, people in blues and greens will not be going into my 10 toc or even voa as easy as it is. do the work, get to the appropriate level so you carry your own weight and then ill take you. gear is stupidly easy nowadays so there isnt a single excuse to start gearing up to appropriate levels.<br />
<br />
maybe im the nutjob, but i prefer dps to do more damage done than the tank. i also live by this general mantra, if every dps was doing the same amount of damage i did in that boss fight, would we clear the encounter? if yes, im doing my part. if not, then someone who is doing more dps than the encounter requires is picking up my slack (again, a general mantra. not all fights are good judges of this). whether its my gear, spec, rotation or whatever, if im not doing the minimum amount to clear the content, i need to pick it up until i am. until then, im being carried, and i hate little more than being carried.<br />
<br />
now if we can get people to have stop doing &quot;6000 gs for naxx&quot; or &quot;lfm 10ICC, pst ach&quot;, ooooooh that runs all over me. people forget that many folks went into 10toc with a smattering of 219's. people also forget heroics have a purpose, and they dont tend to like it when people are still gearing up in heroics. that blows my mind. ive seen people vote kicked out of a heroic even though he was appropriately geared to be there (a mix of regular blues and a few heroic epics and 1 emblem gear). everybody wants quick quick quick lets burn through this at 9000mph and expect people to do 4000 dps in heroics. no addon, no matter how much information it gives you, can fix attitudes like this. i prefer quick runs myself but if someone is there to actually benefit from the place then i suck it up. im on their turf, not the other way around. shame on raid geared toons vote kicking heroic level people out of the heroics they need to gear up.</div></div><hr />

had a full 232 enh shaman yesterday for a 10 man rotface and putricide, guy gear and gems was ok, we really need it a 10 man since was all guildies in their mains so last spot was just a filler we didnt care much what he could do just hero pretty much.<br />
<br />
fight start 10 sec later guy is dead, ok we said he prolly got a lag spike or something, we keep trying and trying and trying, this guy was failing and failing and failing over and over, we got the boss (rotface) i was tanking the big slime and just didnt focus on threat the slime anymore i switched all my dps to the boss instead so we can kill it, i end up with 5k dps while tanking the slime (hunter is my main) the guy end up with 2k.<br />
<br />
for how easy is to get gear now these days i wont say i will even look at gear score add on (since most of my gear is 245 because i had no other choice, bis is bis for MM hunters) but this will give me another information i find out more usefull, like experience and comments.<br />
<br />
will be nice if they add an option to rate players even when you know some ppl will just bad rate someone when they are good. now this add on have that option, i take it. now problem will be how many ppl will use the add on, if only 10 persons in your server side have it then there is no use for it. the more ppl comment will be the best.<br />

There's a big But to my opinion though..<br />
<br />
[...] There'll always be the lazy scrub who demands achievements and skyrocketing gearscores - the good part about that is that you know right away this person is clueless and going with his/her pug is likely to be a waste of time. This addon is less retarded than gearscore, and sure it'll be misused (as everything, it can and will be misused), but if people are going to judge people based on achievements and retarded scores anyway, rather have them do it in the smartest way possible, which is open their eyes to the more important facets that come to judging a person's worth.<br />
<br />
No method to judge a player's worth will ever be foolproof short from just taking someone and experiencing first hand how good he is.<br />
While the addon is similar to Gearscore in terms of gauging someones worth with a numerical value, it goes above and beyond and essentially puts their armory into the WoW client. Sure, the person in full 187-200 blues might not be geared for ICC10 (statistically speaking), but that doesn't mean the guy in near-full 245 gear is experienced enough.<br />
<br />
The game now-a-days allows anyone to complete the base content with nearly any combination of gear, knowledge, and awareness. Someone who has no situational awareness can still clear all current content aside from Putricide. Someone without all the phat lewtz can outperform people decked in 245/258 gear.<br />
<br />
And, unless you're a DPS, performance is difficult to gauge. Topping the healing meters is as important to a healer as stacking hit is. Healing meters vary wildly from fight to fight and person to person. A &quot;traditional&quot; resto druid might do amazingly well on Twin Valkyrs hard mode because of the massive raid-wide damage, but that doesn't mean the resto druid near the bottom is performing worse than the others. You could have too many healers, or he could be focusing on keeping the tanks up because you lack discipline priests or holy paladins (traditionally tank healers). <br />
<br />
Then, you head off to Anub'arak and that druid is topping the meters because the vast majority of the healing is tank healing, with a small amount of short-term, concentrated raid damage. Does this mean that the other druids are underperforming? No!<br />
<br />
Similarly, tanks are difficult to gauge based off of threat alone. While one tank might have amazing threat, he might also be habitually turning his back to bosses/groups of mobs, forcing a wipe (or a lot of pain for your healers). Or, he might be slow to pick up adds, forcing your rogues and hunters to abuse their misdirect and tricks of the trade keys, which then reduces their dps.<br />
<br />
Even DPS meters aren't the best for gauging whether or not one dps is better than another. Take a fight like Vezax. Rogue 1 is interrupting every time it's his turn/his kick is up. Rogue 2 isn't. Rogue 2 stomps all over Rogue 1 on the Damage meters. Who's the better rogue? The one who saved his energy for kick, of course, but that isn't obvious by using only one tool.<br />
<br />
A combination of raid awareness (which comes from experience) and various tools - many of which are addons - help to determine who are your better players and who are not. This addon attempts to consolidate a few of the tools (namely: Heroes, Gearscore, and Armory) into one single in-game tool. Even this addon on its own wont tell you if a player is competent, but it will give you an idea based off of past experience (rating of boss kills), off of your/others past experience with them (via the notes tool, similar to Heroes), and whether or not they understand the gearing requirements of their class/spec (which means raid leaders aren't forced to keep note cards with class gearing/talent requirements handy).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree with you. I have a bunch of alts that I constantly play. I don't even consider any one toon my 'main' because I play so many constantly. I do both PvE and PvP. Sometimes I get caught up in PvP and don't have time to raid and visa versa. My new level 80's (when I get them) have little to no achievements. Most of them were created AFTER release of wrath so have no BC or Vanilla achievements either. Since my schedual is so random, I don't always make guild raid runs and therefore have to pug. I have been denied raid spots on my newest 80 (lock) because my gearscore is only 4400 right now. I still pulled 4800 in ToGC 10man when I went with guild, so I don't see how it's that bad, considering.<br />
<br />
I do understand people wanting those 5500gc people to join over a 4400gc because I would too. The problem is, for something like 25ToC, I don't see much of a difference because I know how 'skillful' I am. Whereas, Joe Random, does not. Which is understandable. With this new addon, it'll just give them one more thing to 'prove' that you're a nub. Oh, your gear is good but you haven't done this raid before, sorry. Or, yeah, I can see that you've done this raid but your gear is bad so you probably got 'carried' through.<br />
<br />
Whether these conclusions are right or wrong, I still think addons that people use to 'choose' their pug members from are stupid. This one is JUST as inaccurate as GS, just you get to see more aspects to make a judgement of the player (be it accurate judgement or not).<br />
<br />
What they need to do is develop an addon that keeps track of a players output in there dungeons and raids. Can be similar to this one but instead of notes or 'bad weapon' and 'experienced in raid', give actual numbers.<br />
<br />
-For dps it's easy, show their average DPS in said raids/dungeons, differentiate between trash and bosses and can have an easy counter for 'deaths caused to avoidable damage' (ie; Fires)<br />
-For heals, you can show their overall healing done, overhealing done, damage absorbed/reduction; differentiate between trash and bosses and use the 'deaths caused to avoidable damage' counter as well<br />
-For tanks, you can show damage mitigated, average mobs per fight (for trash), average threat generation; differentiate between trash and bosses and use the counter here too<br />
<br />
This type of a mod would be 100 times better than any gearbased addon. Those that say &quot;oh, it tests if your gemmed/enchanted correctly too, where GC doesn't&quot;. Well, honestly, what's to stop someone from having their guild TELL them what to enchant/gem or do it for them. I know people in my guild who are terrible players but have 'good' gear and are enchanted/spec properly because other have TOLD them what to do. Yet, you go to raid with them and in their 5300gc, they can't pull over 5k in ICC... how does that ever happen, unless the person is just terrible.<br />
<br />
I would much rather take someone who has 4400gc who does 4500dps than someone in 5400gc and does 4500dps. Just becaus I would HATE that 5400gc person so much for sucking where as the 4400gc person, you know has some good skill.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Player notes<br />
Finished a dungeon, was your tank amazing? Player notes will let you rate him 1 - 5 as well as make a note for future reference, or for other people who group with him. You can leave one note per person, with your most recent note overwriting any old ones.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now if I'm not mistaken that doesn't reduce someone to a number. If someone runs through an instance and the pug is a complete d-bag, you can rate them down and make that their note so others using the add-on can see this. If someone is genuinely stupid and stands in fire doesn't listen to directions WRITE IT IN THE NOTE!!!! This is where you can see past the numbers, past the gear, past the achievements. If this is someones alt, write that down too. Seriously guys read the whole thing. I was never an advocate of GearScore but this is something I could get behind because if I get into a PUG for heroic HoR and the tank wore higher ilvl dps gear just so they could queue for it then I want to know and I want others to know. I want to know if someone is gemming and enchanting incorrectly then look to see what it is that they are doing. In a game where we now know nothing about the others we group with, yes something that makes it easier to deduce (read that as guess, not a 100% for sure answer) the quality of player they are is welcome.<br />
<br />
The thing about this add-on is that it doesn't assign some arbitrary number to someone, it averages their gears ilvl, checks their gems and enchants to their spec, and allows you to rate the PERSON and leave any comments similar to what anyone would do for a business online leaving a customer review and comments. Seriously guys get over yourselves and read the whole article before you troll please. This still won't stop people who are jerks and idiots from auto kicking people with less than their accepted gear score, but do you want to play with someone like that? Do you? If you have this add-on, you can add to THEIR note and call em out on it so that others that end up grouping with them will know. As Boub said, add-ons aren't necessarily bad, people are and add-ons can't cure stupid.</div></div><hr />

Oh, so you believe everything you read online to be 100% true and accurate? What's to stop me from writting someone is a noob just because I dislike them. Or how about when people toss around the word 'ninja' so cavalierly. You call someone out for being a tard in a group, then they get offended and put at note calling you a 'ninja' just to 'get you back'. Yeah, your right. This addon will fix everything. I'm sure no one will abuse the note system ever. Fuck, if this note system is so amazing, why even have anything else in that addon.<br />
<br />
People can alter gearscore by equiping higher lvl items that aren't used for their spec/role, right? So gearscore is flawed. Achievements don't mean anything since you can be 'carried' through almost any achievement now adays. So achievements are flawed. Gems/enchants can be TOLD to you whether you know WHY your gemming/enchanting that way. So gems/enchants are flawed. Experience in a raid/dungeo only gives for this current character, not for the PERSON playing the character, not giving an acurate display of the PERSON'S experience in the raid/dungeon. So experience is flawed. The only TRUTH in here are the player notes, right?</div></div><hr />

If you're still reading this forum, can you do something about it flagging &quot;DPS&quot; weapons as &quot;bad&quot; for DK Tanks? <br />
<br />
Right now I'm using the Citadel Enforcer's claymore, which is solidly a DK tank weapon seeing how they keep us hit rating starved. It shows up as a &quot;Bad&quot; weapon, but the enchant and gem pass. <br />
<br />
<br />
Yea it was fixed already, try the alpha.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now if I'm not mistaken that doesn't reduce someone to a number. <br />
<br />
Yup, you're right. The only time it reduces people to a number is essentially the raid summary where it'll show people have X bad items, and that's just because listening bad items in the row itself wouldn't work very well.<br />

Nothing stops you from writing false information, but it's all public and very obvious it'll specifically list that you wrote the comment. Nobody can corrupt it and make it look like the note was left by somebody else.<br />
<br />
Your entire comment is rather hilarious. If you think the addon is the word of God that should be obeyed to a fault, you are delusional. It's simply a tool to give you more information. The amount of people who actually gem/enchant correctly is pretty low.<br />
<br />
Even when I'm running around Dalaran testing the identification system pretty much everybody is doing something obviously wrong, most of the time the people who do everything right are doing it because they at least know sort of what they re doing. Hell, someone who is going to actually ask around and find out how they should be gemming/enchanting is going to be doing a better job than someone who doesn't bother.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you have to realize that some people gem/enchant current pieces the way they do because the need that extra hit or exp or something along those lines until they get other upgrades. Some people get items that they know they are going to replace soon and just socket blue quality 'cheap' gems because it's better than NOTHING and they might not have the gold to 'waste' by socketing something with an item they will replace in a couple days.<br />
<br />
Does this make said person a bad player? Will this mean that you will wipe with them in your group? Does someone with proper gemming better than someone without proper gemming.<br />
<br />
All this mod will do is give people MORE reasons to 'exclude' people from their raids. &quot;oh, you have 3 bad items&quot;. How many people do you think KNOW that much about other classes that they know WHY it's a bad item or bad enchant? So yes, people who don't know how to use the mod correctly are going to be just as bad with it as the gearscore addon. <br />
<br />
This addon will be most used and 'effective' in pug situations. People who are 'hardcore' at the game and are very knowledgeable about their class and have BiS (or very close to) gear will have guilds they do things with, not pugs. Like you pointed out, &quot;The amount of people who actually gem/enchant correctly is pretty low&quot;, just leads to what I said before. People will have ANOTHER reason (other than gc) to say &quot;no, you don't have the right enchants, im sorry&quot;.<br />
<br />
This mod has potential and would be good if the population of WoW would use it correctly, but it'll be abused and misused JUST like gearscore is.</div></div><hr />

Give you more information than just the score of their gear, but still not a good 'tell' on whether or not someone's a good or bad player. For example, doesn't tell you if that toon's their main or if it's an alt, whether they're actually competent or whether they've paid to have their toon run through raids to get loot.<br />
<br />
In the end, it still comes down to having to pug with a person to see if they're a baddie or a decent player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. So whether the addon is considered 'good' or 'bad' is irrelevant since it only provides a broader view of the player, not a more accurate view.</div></div><hr />

You really should actually use the addon before you write comments like this, because you obviously haven't and you are basing it off what you think it does, not what it actually does.<br />
<br />
Somebody who gems extra hit or expertise? Not going to get flagged.<br />
Somebody who gems blue quality gems into epic gear? Yup, not going to get flagged.<br />
Rest Druid wearing feral gear? Yup, it even tells you that they are wearing &quot;Physical DPS&quot; gear and that's why it's bad.<br />
<br />
Next time, post with facts not your feelings of how it works.</div></div><hr />

So your comment about how when you went around Dalaran and inspected people almost everyone was doing something wrong? This would be not gemming extra hit or using blue quality, this would be seeing a restro druid in feral gear?<br />

To clarify, I am not saying the ADDON alone, on it's own, is bad. I'm saying it'll be USED badly just as gearcore is USED badly. Neither addon alone are bad.</div></div><hr />

No, it was a mix of people not enchanting/gemming, green quality gems in epic gear (Which will be flagged), odd gem choices like pure MP5 gems, spell penetration gems. Plenty of people using bad gear, one was a Retribution Paladin wearing a Spirit ring and gemming INT or something equally absurd.</div></div><hr />

Take one guess why Blizzard is so harsh on banishing naming and shaming from the official WoW forums? Because people always feel compelled to name and shame people. Even if there is very little reason to do so.<br />

Okay, I edited my comment before, but not sure if you'll read it since it was after you posted yours.<br />
<br />
To clarify, I am not saying the ADDON alone, on it's own, is bad. I'm saying it'll be USED badly just as gearcore is USED badly. Neither addon alone are bad.<br />
<br />
That being said. I won't use the addon because I would find little use in it. I just have a problem trying to base judgement and pre-information on an addon that is subject to built in 'bad/good' gearchecks. Achievements/experience that do not help at ALL for alt characters and personalized notes that are from the player base.<br />
<br />
I understand that if you have all good reviews:<br />
&quot;awesome tank, wow&quot;<br />
&quot;run was soo much easier with this tank, good job&quot;<br />
&quot;great tanking dude&quot;<br />
&quot;he's a nub, don't ever ever ever ever group with him&quot;<br />
<br />
Yeah, the one comment there is probably a bias 'retaliation' comment which can easily be discarded as not an accurate dipiction of experience with this player. The problem is, allowing anyone to comment basically in anway way they want will result in either a very long list to have to read through and/or bias opinions.<br />
<br />
Again, it's not a 'bad' addon, it's just something that I FEEL is unnessecary for the game. Without it, people are still forming successful pugs, why do people need ANOTHER tool that will be used to 'dismiss' people rather than 'accept' them. Good example, your addon shows a list of 'bad' gear not a list of 'good' gear. Pointing out the flaws tends to lead to people dismissing due to x amount of negatives over accepting due to x amount of positives.<br />
<br />
EX:<br />
Student A got seven things correct on their test. So they got 7/10.<br />
Student B got three things wrong on their test. So they got 7/10.<br />
<br />
Both are the same result but Student A is an example of demonstrating how GOOD someone did. Where as Student B demonstrates how BAD someone did. (This is just an example, not an exact medifore)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quoting without context when the original post wasn't related to notes, nice.<br />
<br />
Note syncing is pretty much always going to be restricted to friends and right now it's guild members. If a guild member leaves a bad note on someone, nothing stops you from asking them why. If you can't trust your guild members to answer with the truth then you're going to have issues regardless of if you use EG or not.<br />

<br />
<br />
You can't show a list of good gear, because you are showing too much information then. It's not very useful if people have to look through 15-17 rows of items, 14 rows of enchants and ~25 rows of gems to find out which are good or bad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dyce09</div><div class="date">2010-01-12, 10:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't show a list of good gear, because you are showing too much information then.

<br />
<br />
Again, this mentallity comes from you wanting to SHOW a characters flaws in their gear. Wanting to KNOW of the bads. Which is fine, to each their own. This is just something I disagree with. Yes, hopefully the list is shorter of the 'bad' verses the 'good' but what's to stop you from making an addon that says &quot;15 good items&quot;. You don't have to SHOW all the items that are good. It's just the mindset of someone using an addon that points out negatives, they are most likely going to be looking for the flaws/bad things in that character. To which would most likely be used to say &quot;sorry, your not good enough&quot;.<br />
<br />
Rather than using an addon that focuses on the good so that people would most likely be able to say &quot;yeah, you're good enough&quot;.<br />
<br />
See the difference there? It's about using negatives to seperate people rather than positives.<br />
<br />
&quot;I didn't recruit Player A because he had x bad items/enchants/gems and poor comments&quot;<br />
OR<br />
&quot;I did recruit Player A because his gear is good enough for this instance&quot;<br />
<br />
Not saying that people cannot achieve a positive review of a fellow player, it just promotes a more negative use. Like gearscore was used to disqualify people not qualify them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wolfenlied</div><div class="date">2010-01-12, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think most of you people having bad experience with pug leaders demanding achievements and being overgeared for the instance/raid remember only those &quot;bad guys&quot;.<br />
I've had as a tank similiar problems - people dropping from my group because of my &quot;only&quot; 25k hp in heroics. I've worked my ass off to get starting tank items, enchant them and gem then to be properly defense capped (at least 540, since I was so naive to think it was easy getting to Naxx pug) and have a good amount of mitigation and avoidance, only to be yelled at by those who already had their 4pt9 and considered themselves game experts because of their gear.<br />
However, once I got a few HC gear pieces, more and more dungeons come after them. And there came a breaking point, when the beginning was:<br />
&quot;OMFG, such low HP, you will be a pain to heal you ass&quot;<br />
and after the successful finish with quick pulls, no wipes and proper aggro holding, it comes:<br />
&quot;I'm sorry I was wrong&quot;<br />
These words were the god-damned best words I heard as a tank in an instance. Don't give them a single chance to doubt you. Show these assholes in purples that you can do what you're supposed to do.<br />
Most of the time, you won't hear nice words. I don't, because it really takes the balls to say something nice about someone on the Internet, and it takes even more to admit that you were wrong. So just try to remember those moment you were not told a single word because you just didn't let these idiots die (tank)/kept every intellectually challenged guy in your group alive (healer)/beat the hell out of the instance mobs (dps) in your ilvl 175 gear.<br />
<br />
EG, though I didn't try it and probably never will, seems like a good addon, because it doesn't assign a number to a player - and unless it has got some ridiculous pattern of marking people as &quot;bad&quot; because they don't get the achievement for the instance, I see it as a step forward from GS-like addons.<br />
However, once you boot someone because he got spell power gear on his death knight - for the love of everything, TELL HIM what's wrong. Most people will disagree, but some players are really NEW to the game. I started playing once WotLK came out, but thanks to the sites like MMOChamp or EJ I knew HOW to play after about month or two!<br />
I've had a friend in a guild that didn't have a clue about what he was doing. So I offered him my help. Now he is specced properly, uses right gems and tries to enchant his gear whenever possible to dish out proper damage.<br />
That's wrong with the WoW community - exactly what is wrong with the majority of Internet society - it's filled with frustration, anger and prejudice. A little kindness goes a long way - help a player, and it can spare you time looking for another tank/healer/dps in updating your guild in the future. Believe in karma! Doing something right now will NEVER bite you in the ass in the future, while doing something wrong has a high chance to do so.<br />
<br />
And since I'm just about to roll a DK dps, I can only hope that pug leaders become more reasonable and forgiving. Honestly, when you run 4 raids with people you don't know, 3 are failed but one of them makes at least one player worth it get better gear, I wouldn't think this time was wasted. It's my opinion though, and majority of people will differ.<br />
Want to raid effortless, without caring about elitist idiots that tend to boot you because of what they think is wrong with you?<br />
Find a guild. It will take a long, long, long time to actually find one that WILL raid and WILL help you gear in this &quot;obsolete&quot; Naxx, but once you're the part of the team that suits your schedule, you'll feel the game is actually worth what you pay it for. Coming out from a casual player - you don't need the game to be your second (or even first) life to raid. Just find people you would really like to play with, and ignore everyone else.<br />
Oh, WTB longer ignore list BTW :) (&quot;WTF YOU HAVE 4 ILVL 200 PIECES YOU CAN'T JOIN NAXX10&quot; - my personal favourite)</div></div><hr />

There is a difference between coordinated crowd-control and a 1-man wrecking ball.<br />
<br />
Additionally, in that example, neither the Rogue nor Mage are in plate armor and with defensive CD's. I'm no developer, but my hunch is that part of the Warbringer nerf is a way of telling the PvP Prot Warrior, &quot;You can't have it all.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
what the anti-warrior crowd isn't seeing is that both charge, and intercept's cooldown is 20 times longer than the stun they put on the charged target. every class has multiple escape mechanisms that they can use to get away from a warrior at the right time. i bolded that for you, because a lot of people seem to think they are fighting npc's instead of other players in pvp. if say your a mage that nova's a prot warrior you should expect that warrior to charge straight away to get out of the root and be back on you. at that time you should blink away, which you should expect him/her to burn their intercept on you. imediately re-nova and burn the warrior down that now cannot escape for the next 10 or so seconds... unless your fighting a human warrior. then your f***ed.<br />
<br />
the problem here is a majority of these warrior haters have never played on a warrior past lvl 15. so they have no experience of what it's like to pvp as a warrior at lvl 80. i can assure all of you never been a warrior haters that it's not all ribbons and rainbows all of the time as a warrior. most of you QQ'ers only experience with the warrior class is being on the other side of a perfect situation for a warrior. that being a target who's major abilities/spells are on cooldown, at half health, and sitting down afk-guarding the a flag. and trust me i've seen my fair share of mages/locks/hunters that just sit there and take it from me because their player ran to get another soda. a majority of this prot warrior ownage that people talk about are cases of very good warriors going up against very poorly played other classes. any time i go up against another class that knows atleast half of what they are doing it's about 50/50 that i come out of it alive. poor players i kill every time. so should I be punished because i don't suck, and kill players that do suck?<br />
<br />
i mean are we still in Kindergarten here where i get sent to the corner because I have a toy that some other spoiled brat wanted so bad that he started banging his head on the table?</div></div><hr />
