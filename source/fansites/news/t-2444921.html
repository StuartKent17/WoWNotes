Hey guys! Just wanted to take some time to set some expectations ahead of time when it comes to all of the announcements and discussions when it comes to what we’ll be talking about at BlizzCon this weekend, as well as remind everybody of some changes when it comes to security this year for attendees.<br />
<br />
As you all are probably aware, we’ve been hard at work on the upcoming Tides of Vengeance content update. We are very excited for this update and it is very much our immediate focus and will continue to be until after we’ve delivered it to you all. At BlizzCon you’ll be hearing us talk mainly about what comes after Tides of Vengeance. We do plan on discussing some of it, but as many of you know, BlizzCon is where we typically talk about longer term goals and plans. The feedback you all have given us about Battle for Azeroth is something we are very grateful for and we can’t wait for you to experience everything coming with Tides of Vengeance.<br />
<br />
For those at home on the Virtual Ticket, please let us know what you think about all the things we share that are upcoming for World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
As for the security updates I mentioned earlier, we recently posted a blog on the BlizzCon site that I want to mirror to increase awareness. We’ve enhanced our security this year so I want to make sure to mention that you guys should look at arriving earlier than previous years especially if you’re wanting to catch the opening ceremony live on Friday.<br />
<br />
As for the measures we’ve added Metal Detectors as well as Bag Checks at every point of entrance this year. For any additional information about locations of entrances, ADA accessibility, cosplay check-ins, and restrictions, please check out the post on the BlizzCon site about the updates to the usual processes this year:<br />
https://blizzcon.com/en-us/news/22564764/blizzcon-2018-entry-points-update-be-sure-to-arrive-early<br />
<br />
For those who are coming out to Anaheim for the show, we look forward to meeting you and spending the weekend geeking out with you.<br />
<br />
Enjoy the show everyone!</div></div><hr />

We know what we can expect, and what it will bring. That is why Im happy with this news. I want to know what future patches will bring, and even if they bring anything significant to the game. Because another warfront that has only other skin, won't do the justice...<br />
And fixing ongoing problem with azerite gear isn't content either, it's just bringing us something that should be here from beginning.<br />
Looking forward for this year blizzcon =)!</div></div><hr />

A bunch of people have kept saying that Blizzard is just going to talk about 8.1. Not smart people, obviously, but still a bunch of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tides of Vengeance is 8.1, there is nothing secret about it, you can find most everything on it on the news stories posted here at MMO-C.<br />
<br />
It would make for a boring show, because we already know a lot about it.<br />
<br />
Instead, Blizz is going to focus on what comes after 8.1, with 8.2 and beyond at Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

I guess some people are thinking back to Gamescom in 2017 where blizz pretty much just talked about 7.3 even though it was on ptr for some time at that point and revealed a trailer for the patch. Though this is blizzcon so it was a given that blizz would talk about what comes after 8.1. I think we could get a trailer for 8.1 but other than that it's gonna be about 8.2 and classic, and perhaps a small hint of 8.3.</div></div><hr />

They did the same with diablo this year, where they said there isn't anything big coming with diablo. I think they just want to make sure that nobody expects something that isn't coming. :)</div></div><hr />

He's fed up with the gun-obsessed culture of America that can't bring itself to condemn mass shootings with any seriousness and implement common-sense gun control that doesn't &quot;take our guns.&quot;<br />
<br />
I admit he's a little F'd up for hoping for violence there, though. I hope everyone stays says with all the increased security measures and I imagine they'll have police or armed security manning he security checkpoints.</div></div><hr />

Well, there is one thing I hope to see about 8.1 - in-game cinematic trailer (not &quot;here's the raid and stuff&quot; but something connected to story like trailers for 7.2 and 7.3).</div></div><hr />

They definitely need to focus on creating an evergreen Progression System going forward and shape the Content and everything around it. I'm sick of this &quot;Go and Throw&quot; Systems of the last expansions.</div></div><hr />

Shit rewards for virtual ticket holders at an increased price - seriously a 2 hour demo for $50? Dull panels as we know there's no next-gen Diablo, only a mobile game, maybe possibly a new IP but who knows what state that will be in. Those going to enjoy the atmosphere live get to have that dampened by enhanced security to prevent shooters... Not saying it doesn't make sense; but it sure as fuck doesn't seem warm, fun or inviting either. And once they're through the metal detectors they get to enjoy the &quot;literally who&quot; tier bands. Well worth the money!</div></div><hr />

It's just kind of...odd. Again, probably nothing, or the fan base is so desperate for something new/different on all forums, expectations are wildly off the chart.

Well, there are people craving to beta test a 2004 game for 2 hours. That's why. <br />
How fast they sell is based on the convention popularity (and its bonuses), we can't really tell if it will suck until it sucks. Which, this time around, is likely going to happen.</div></div><hr />

Yes because going to an event with theatrics and meeting people with friends. Seeing things live and getting to play things on the floor is surely the same as a $50 advertisement stream.<br />

The more I hear about this Blizzcon the less I like it. Shit rewards for virtual ticket holders at an increased price - seriously a 2 hour demo for $50? Dull panels as we know there's no next-gen Diablo, only a mobile game, maybe possibly a new IP but who knows what state that will be in. Those going to enjoy the atmosphere live get to have that dampened by enhanced security to prevent shooters... Not saying it doesn't make sense; but it sure as fuck doesn't seem warm, fun or inviting either. And once they're through the metal detectors they get to enjoy the &quot;literally who&quot; tier bands. Well worth the money!<br />
<br />
Where did you get the idea its 2 hours?<br />
also you are not paying 50$ for simply the 2 hour demo.<br />
lolol i love how you make extra secruity to stop shooters a NEGATIVE THING, WTF!?<br />

It's probably nothing, but it's odd that twice now, Blizzard has purposefully told people to keep their expectations down for Blizzcon. It's just kind of...odd. Again, probably nothing, or the fan base is so desperate for something new/different on all forums, expectations are wildly off the chart. I can't recall them ever doing that, but I don't have an encyclopedic memory of all build ups to past Blizzcons. <br />

it is better to suspect nothing and be suprised<br />
then suspect everything and be let down.<br />

(Activision) Blizzard is slowly checkmating itself.<br />
<br />
In chess it's an illegal move to checkmate yourself to stop retards less bright people from losing to their own idiocy. In real life there is no such rule.</div></div><hr />

And the facts are out there, both the physical and virtual tickets sell like hot cakes regardless. Hell, even the people professing loud and clear how they won't be paying to watch &quot;the shitty show&quot; are looking for other ways to watch it anyway.</div></div><hr />

You know, that some point of the raid is on the open sea? That Jaina, is the end encounter? You know that crucible of storms if during tides of vengeance and will probably end in Nazjatar rising?</div></div><hr />

They don't want professional quality video shot from the back of the hall of the presentations, to be uploaded online, because they're selling that feature through the virtual ticket, just guessing.<br />

<br />
So because rubes buy them, that somehow devalues legitimate criticism?<br />
<br />
And stop comparing event tickets to virtual tickets, they are completely different things. One gets you access to a live even with various benefits and the ability to socialize. The other is a live stream advertisement.</div></div><hr />

Nah, I believe it's less that and more of the process they are going through to bring it back. Probably also saying clarifying some of the changes (Or rather, lack there of) for some folks too, but most of it will be on the technical side of things.</div></div><hr />

Besides looking into MMO-champion for pictures and announcement, there's some other way I could follow a live stream of the panels?

Having always used the Virtual Ticket I'm not sure if any of this exists in order to follow the show (also, not only WoW which will be covered here, but Diablo etc.). Any pointers?
