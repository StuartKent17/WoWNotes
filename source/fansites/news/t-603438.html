The Feast of Winter Veil will start soon (in 2 weeks and 6 days actually) and it didn't look like we could expect something new. Wrong ! If you read carefully the 2.3.2 patch notes you will notice this line :<br />
Clockwork Rocket Bots will no longer attack each other in Shattrath City.<br />
Good news, the item is now linkable on PTRs and the ItemID is right after a new [Winter Veil Gift] item (Basically, it means that they probably were added at the same time during the development process). The following is pure speculation but we can assume they're both additions to the Winter Veil Feast rewards, and we can go further by supposing that these bots will use the new Holidayrobot model introduced in the 2.3 patch. Keep in mind that nothing is confirmed yet.<br />
<br />
Update : It seems that this item on the US PvE server, the only one I never join, obviously. New screenshot added, at least it means that I'm still good at speculating. (even when it's useless)<br />

New feature on IRC channel : WowBot<br />
A new bot called WowBot has been added to <br />
#mmo-champion on irc.quakenet.org (irc://irc.quakenet.org/mmo-champion), thanks to Olison. This bot will let you convert arena points/ratings, get information from the armory, and give you the date of a particular event. It's still in development so please report any bug on the dedicated site. <br />
!ap - Rating -&gt; Arena points<br />
!apr - Arena Points -&gt; Rating<br />
!ar - Armory: Character Profiles<br />
!guild - Armory: Guilds information<br />
!ti - Armory: Details about an arena team.<br />
!ladder - Armory: Arena Ladders (Top 3 of a battlegroup)<br />
!event - search the calendar for a specific upcoming event or display active events<br />
<br />
<br />
You can check the full bot FAQ (http://fireglow.de/wowbot.html) for more details about each command.<br />
<br />

<br />
Thottbot / WoWHead new scripts<br />
While we're talking about useful things, both Thottbot (http://thottbot.com/x/power) and Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/?forums&amp;topic=3464&amp;p=35822) released new scripts that let you link any item without installing anything on your site. <br />
<br />
Thottbot<br />
&lt;script src=&quot;http://i.thottbot.com/power.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http&amp;#58;//thottbot.com/i30987&quot;&gt;Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
Wowhead<br />
&lt;script src=&quot;http://www.wowhead.com/widgets/power.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
&lt;a class=&quot;q5&quot; href=&quot;http&amp;#58;//www.wowhead.com/?item=19019&quot;&gt;Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker&lt;/a&gt;<br />
<br />
In both case, you will get the tooltip of the item you want, the script from wowhead comes with an additional &quot;class&quot; features that let you color item links (0 = Gray, 1 = White, 2 = Green, 3 = Rare, 4 = Epic, 5 = Legendary). You can also add it easily to thottbot links just by setting a font color on your link.<br />
<br />
Both sites are currently developping this feature and we'll probably see more cool things from it soon. Thottbot already let you set up your own tooltip and add a search box to your page. Feel free to read the dedicated page on Thottbot (http://thottbot.com/x/power) and Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/?forums&amp;topic=3464&amp;p=35822) to see what's best for you.</div></div><hr />
