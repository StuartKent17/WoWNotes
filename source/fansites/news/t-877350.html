‘Dev Watercooler’ is a blog series that provides an inside look into the thoughts and discussions happening within the World of Warcraft development team. In our first entry, Lead Systems Designer Greg &quot;Ghostctrawler&quot; Street laid down a few ground rules:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1. No promises are being made in these Dev Watercooler blogs.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Don’t read too much between the lines.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. No complaints about the topic not being what you want to see covered.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are spellcast interrupt abilities, such as Kick, too good? It’s easy to make that argument. We think their ease of use and low cooldown has led to a whole cascade of events in PvP. Because interrupts are so good, casters without a lot of instant spells or mobility are weak. For that reason, we tend to give casters a lot of instant spells or movement abilities, and casters who excel at those (say, Frost mages) are very powerful, while those without (say, Elemental shaman) have more difficulty.<br />
<br />
Because interrupts are good, classes without them feel uncompetitive, which has led to us giving interrupts to paladins and druids, which in turn has led to them being even more prevalent. Because casters tend to fire off lots of instant spells while jumping around, melee can be really easy to kite. Because melee can be easy to kite, melee classes without strong mobility can suffer, and we have to consider giving high mobility to all melee, which increases the amount of uptime melee have on casters, which means we have to give casters even more powerful escape mechanisms to survive... and the arms race continues.<br />
<br />
See where I’m going with this? Because instant spells tend to be so powerful, we have to make cast time spells insanely powerful to compete or they’ll never see use in PvP. But we have to make those spells so powerful that when they do get off, we can have PvP burst issues. (Look at how much better Frostbolt has to be than Ice Lance for mages to even consider the “long” cast.)<br />
<br />
Nerfing all of the interrupts across the board isn’t the kind of thing we can realistically do mid-expansion. Anyone working on the raid content can tell you how important interrupts are to today's encounter design. We’d have to redesign nearly all of the raid encounters and many of the dungeon encounters as well. Of course once you increase the cooldown on interrupts, then availability of stuns gains relative power, so you have that balance consideration as well.<br />
<br />
Instant spells do have their place in the game. If you’re worried about being interrupted because someone is chasing you, or you are chasing them, that’s a great time to use an instant spell. But actual 2.5 sec cast time spells need to have their place too and, if anything, they should be the norm.<br />
<br />
Here's one other way in which interrupts have wide-reaching effects on the game via the chain of consequences discussed above. One of the advantages melee used to have in PvE was on movement fights. If the boss has to be kited or stays in motion, the rogues and warriors can follow along and still deal damage. It will be less damage for sure, but they’ll still get a lot of auto attacks in. It used to be the case that asking the Balance druid or Fire mage to move was a huge dps loss for them, because they were always interrupting their spells. In today’s PvE environment, that role has almost flipped. Many casters can shoot on the run and take only a very minimal DPS hit to do so. For this reason (and a few others) melee classes can feel like a liability on certain encounters. We’d prefer for raids to want a fairly even distribution of ranged to melee classes and ideally groups would have a lot of flexibility in who they bring. It’s okay to have fights that are really good for casters, but there need to be at least a couple that feel great for melee as well.<br />
<br />
Is there a design lesson to learn here? I guess it’s some variant of the butterfly effect -- apparently innocuous designs (in this case the short cooldown on interrupt abilities) can have wide-ranging effects on all aspects of the game. I’m not sure what the game would look like if Pummel and Kick and Wind Shear had 30 second cooldowns. Clearly we’d have to redesign a lot of other abilities, mechanics, and numbers to make it work. Again, this isn’t a change you’ll see anytime soon. But it might feel better in the long run if we could get to that point.<br />

Why not put like a 45 second - 1 minute immunity on interrupts too? That way, getting interrupted sucks but you aren't getting chain interrupted for days on end.<br />
Interrupts do have DR afaik.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shambulanced</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Greg. No kidding.<br />
<br />
See, there was something the Devs said pre-Cata about development. They said they wanted to end the whole &quot;tank takes massive damage spike&quot; design style and normalize PvE damage.<br />
<br />
Then we got to Cata, and what happened? On one of the first bossfights of the xpac in the dungeons (naga priestess in Throne) she has a one-hit killer that *has* to be interrupted. (I am aware, before you smart-arses reply saying &quot;Oh I can soak that hit now it's no big&quot; that gear has since trivialized it, for a large part. BUT, at the time, when the content was relevant, it was a death sentence.)<br />
<br />
Long story short--Interrupt mechanics on bossfights really aren't that fun, especially when they require a rotation (Nefarian 25, looking back at General Vex in Ulduar, sometimes Halfus Wyrmbreaker 10&amp;25) or when the survival of the entire raid hinges on them. When interrupt mechanics ARE fun in PvE is when they're a sort of &quot;bonus&quot; thing--like interrupting caster adds in Stonecore that stops them from xforming, or stopping a boss from casting a shadowbolt (which wouldn't kill anybody, but it's fun to do!). <br />
<br />
TL;DR: Interrupting in PvE is fun when it's something skilled players can do as a bonus, NOT when all dpsers MUST do as a requirement. I don't give a rip about PvP &quot;balance,&quot; I've long since given up on that.</div></div><hr />

No, the lesson is that you need a strong theoretical foundation for your game. Otherwise you end up a huge mess of fix upon fix and a game that never has real balance (like WoW PvE).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interrupts are just another mechanic of raiding. Your argument is the same as me saying &quot;Having to avoid standing in fire isn't fun. I should be able to stand in it if I want to. If I feel like avoiding it I could but it shouldn't kill me if I stand in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, a boss that has a mechanic that is designed to be interrupted that kills you when you fail at that mechanic has nothing to do with Blizzard's design goals of tanks not getting two shot. On this boss, if your tank dies, it's because you fail at executing the fight properly.</div></div><hr />

Here's to hoping that a nerf to interrupts gives us back the rootbreaking of shapeshifting.</div></div><hr />

hmm you mean like hunters having 1 interupt on a 30 second cd, That they have to spec deep into the MM tree just to be able to use?<br />
gosh, it is a wonder why hunters have been the least represented class in arenas since season 1.</div></div><hr />

Demo locks could have a disarm on their felguard, fire mages could heat the handle of a hilt and force it to be disarmed, ele shammies could shock the weapons free, and Spriests have one. If all melee can take the main weapon of casters (spells) away, then casters should be able to do the same and disarm the melee's weapons for a short period of time.

Now that we're all on the same page about whats wrong, the big question is how do we fix it? I sense the next xpac will be back to the drawing board...<br />
<br />
<br />
For gods sake, just separate PvE and PvP talent trees and spells already, STOP CHANGING PVE FOR PVP! My guess is that is a path the dev's dont want to go down, but may end up being the only solution.<br />

idk i just think that would add more unneeded bloat to the game</div></div><hr />

<br />
But then you get hit with a lag spike, and miss the interrupt. At least now, you have a chance.<br />
<br />
This is just another sign that Blizzard doesn't know what they're doing. &quot;Oh, noes!!!!! PVPers are getting interrupted too often, and are complaining about it!!!!! We must totally destroy PVE abilites, just to make those PVPers happy!!!!!&quot; For God's sake, if they want WoW to be like Unreal Tournament, they should just make it so and be done with it. This shoehorning of two different styles of gameplay isn't working, and hasn't for a long time. We can see that, so why Blizzard can't is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And giving every melee an interupt or silence didn't? It's about balancing it out, and giving one tree for each caster able to disarm the melee on the same c/d as the interupt's/silences would balance it out for the casters but not tip the scale unfavorably. They gave every melee a way to take the caster's weapons (spells) away over the last two expansions but casters (short of frost mages) have been left out to dry and need a shift in the paradigm to balance things back out without tipping the scales too much in their favor.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PlatedPriest</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">suggestion #2 increase the DR on lockout/silences. that way when ppl are looking for a cluch silence they will interrupt when they need to. instead of on CD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, it's a 20 second cooldown (Silencing Shot (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=34490/silencing-shot)). And this combined with with a moth's Serenity Dust (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=50318) or nether ray's Nether Shock (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=50479) gives hunters a few more options than you're giving them credit for, I think. To be honest, I don't think the lack of an interrupt by itself is what keeps hunter representation down in arena.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 04:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Shambulanced. Especially in 10man encounters, interrupts are too heavy on the raid. Halfus hc and Maloriak hc - fail an interrupt and it's, essentially, a wipe. Let's not even get me started about Nef phase 2 - our tanks weren't hitcapped when we started progress and the amount of regemming and reforging it took them, because one missed interrupt and it was a wipe. Not being hitcapped as a tank in 10mans for this very reason isn't very viable, unless you fancy regemming, forging, or having some secret trinket somewhere around for every other boss. Unfortunately, being forced in the Destro role for replenish, I feel 100% useless on such fights, as do the ~7 others of my raid - we just watch our raid wipe time and again on interrupt progress, missed interrupts, warrior not in range of halfus, mages accidentally interrupting adds instead of aoe, the list goes on and on. And for them it's frustrating too, because it's super stressful (talk to our warrior about the Malo interrupts and his sleepless nights over it, or to our shaman alt who had to log his shaman for proper Halfus hc interrupts pre nerf) and you get the feeling you're making everyone wait for this single aspect of the encounter. On certain fights I actually felt the need to bring the felpup out for some additional interrupting help (mage died!! 2 minute cooldown on CR - kind of situations).<br />
<br />
Long story short, when our warrior called this expansion &quot;World of Interrupts&quot; he wasn't mistaken at all. Whenever we start progress on a new boss, the first thing we joke about is &quot;so, what do we interrupt&quot;. People wouldn't believe me at first when I said, yes, even Atra hc needs interrupts. <br />
<br />
It's fun for a bit, sure. But the point remains that interrupts are too important an aspect in this game right now and it takes a heavy toll on 10man raids (I'm unsure how it is in 25, as our guild is 10man exclusive). Nerf? Maybe not, but a lesson from it? Would be great for upcoming raids.<br />
<br />
That said, I can't say I get the feelings most encounters were designed with 10mans in mind, at all (To4W hc 10man progress first boss alone, it just sucks to feel like every few players are playing in a different instance on a different platform. We had jokes like &quot;SO, how is Team Wind doing?&quot; &quot;Team Wind is Doing ----- BAD WIND BLAST, BAD, WATCH IT ---- FINE --, and how is Team Frost? Falling asleep yet?&quot; frost: &quot;~~ murmle&quot;).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leggomyeggo</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 04:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ranged don't need the ability to disarm melee classes. This is why they have the ability to kite. When you are kiting, the melee classes are about as effective as a caster is when silenced or interrupted. <br />
<br />
Now, if Blizzard wanted to give disarms to classes that can't kite very well now as a means to mix things up, that could be interesting. The issue is, most interrupters can still interrupt/silence when disarmed. I guess it's better than nothing, but still, giving the ranged classes that can't kite well better tools to kite would likely be better than giving them disarms.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brett Skullcrack</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">See, there was something the Devs said pre-Cata about development. They said they wanted to end the whole &quot;tank takes massive damage spike&quot; design style and normalize PvE damage.<br />
<br />
Then we got to Cata, and what happened? On one of the first bossfights of the xpac in the dungeons (naga priestess in Throne) she has a one-hit killer that *has* to be interrupted.<br />
<br />
These are two completely unrelated things. The spiky damage on tanks was due to extremely high avoidance rates which meant that Blizzard had to rely on very high damage attacks or the healers would've been twiddling their thumbs the whole fight. On the other hand, one-shot spells that have to be interrupted have always existed in WoW as a game mechanic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Long story short--Interrupt mechanics on bossfights really aren't that fun, especially when they require a rotation (Nefarian 25, looking back at General Vex in Ulduar, sometimes Halfus Wyrmbreaker 10&amp;25) or when the survival of the entire raid hinges on them. <br />
<br />
I've been doing these interrupt fights for years, it's very stressful when one mistake will wipe the raid, but it's also very rewarding when you succeed at it. It's a perfectly valid mechanic and there's no reason to remove it.<br />
<br />
<br />
When interrupt mechanics ARE fun in PvE is when they're a sort of &quot;bonus&quot; thing--like interrupting caster adds in Stonecore that stops them from xforming, or stopping a boss from casting a shadowbolt (which wouldn't kill anybody, but it's fun to do!). <br />
<br />
Yeah, so you want a game where you cannot fail. Personally I find such &quot;bonus&quot; mechanics completely meaningless.</div></div><hr />

Most of the spells that are casted are like 2 sec so interupting in the middle will lead to 3 sec lost instead 5 like it is now. Considering that u dont loose global CD etc it will be still woth interupt but it will not have such huge effect.</div></div><hr />

This has a facing issue. One of the reasons I like instants and dots is because I don't need to be facing my target to hit them, especially when they jump all over my body. Casting a 2.5s spell only to have the melee be 3 pixels behind you at the end of the cast feels BRUTAL. You basically were interrupted in this case, without a lock out. 2.5s spent doing nothing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leggomyeggo</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 04:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree with Shambulanced. Especially in 10man encounters, interrupts are too heavy on the raid. Halfus hc and Maloriak hc - fail an interrupt and it's, essentially, a wipe. Let's not even get me started about Nef phase 2 - our tanks weren't hitcapped when we started progress and the amount of regemming and reforging it took them, because one missed interrupt and it was a wipe. Not being hitcapped as a tank in 10mans for this very reason isn't very viable, unless you fancy regemming, forging, or having some secret trinket somewhere around for every other boss. Unfortunately, being forced in the Destro role for replenish, I feel 100% useless on such fights, as do the ~7 others of my raid - we just watch our raid wipe time and again on interrupt progress, missed interrupts, warrior not in range of halfus, mages accidentally interrupting adds instead of aoe, the list goes on and on. And for them it's frustrating too, because it's super stressful (talk to our warrior about the Malo interrupts and his sleepless nights over it, or to our shaman alt who had to log his shaman for proper Halfus hc interrupts pre nerf) and you get the feeling you're making everyone wait for this single aspect of the encounter. On certain fights I actually felt the need to bring the felpup out for some additional interrupting help (mage died!! 2 minute cooldown on CR - kind of situations).<br />
<br />
Long story short, when our warrior called this expansion &quot;World of Interrupts&quot; he wasn't mistaken at all. Whenever we start progress on a new boss, the first thing we joke about is &quot;so, what do we interrupt&quot;. People wouldn't believe me at first when I said, yes, even Atra hc needs interrupts. <br />
<br />
It's fun for a bit, sure. But the point remains that interrupts are too important an aspect in this game right now and it takes a heavy toll on 10man raids (I'm unsure how it is in 25, as our guild is 10man exclusive). Nerf? Maybe not, but a lesson from it? Would be great for upcoming raids.<br />
<br />
That said, I can't say I get the feelings most encounters were designed with 10mans in mind, at all (To4W hc 10man progress first boss alone, it just sucks to feel like every few players are playing in a different instance on a different platform. We had jokes like &quot;SO, how is Team Wind doing?&quot; &quot;Team Wind is Doing ----- BAD WIND BLAST, BAD, WATCH IT ---- FINE --, and how is Team Frost? Falling asleep yet?&quot; frost: &quot;~~ murmle&quot;).<br />
Again, interrupts are just one of the mechanics that Blizzard has to make encounters challenging. Don't complain about wiping on heroic encounters because your raiders aren't able to do what the encounter is asking them to do. That is the fail on the part of your raiders, not Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is my biggest beef with the system. I've never understood why it has been so fundamentally broken since the beginning. I'm fine with having to face my target at the start of the spell since it makes sense to face who I'm shooting this ball of fire at, but it makes no sense to check again at the completion of the spell. Just remove the final check and be done with it. No more caster dancing.</div></div><hr />

- No idea of what the game they are supposedly developping is, or how it works<br />
- Have no clue<br />
- Have absolutly no bearing on what is done or how things are<br />
- Only &quot;realise&quot; things months after it has been put live when pretty much every one with a brain told them what would happen when it was on PTR (or before).<br />
<br />
For the druids, i would LOVE for them to point out the &quot;prevalence of druids&quot; (ie : ferals, they are the only ones with an interupt) in pvp.<br />
The only time they were numerous was early in Cata when people weren't used to fight them and when the lack of resilience made their bleeds quite op. Now, they are nowhere to be seen due to the huge series of nerfs.<br />
<br />
For the fights with prevalence to melee, we are still waiting for one or two, when anyone can count over 15 heavily favoring ranged, JUST taking into account raid content from Wrath and Cata.... The only fight favoring &quot;melee&quot; (sorry it didn't favor melee but physical dps, which made those with roughly half their damage as holy/magical not that good, and hunters nearly as good as melee) was XT.<br />
<br />
Saurfang you had the exact same result putting ranged on him and having no melee (put them focusing the boss and it has the same result, except they won't take damage or make Saurfang generate more rp if they aggro the beast with &quot;cleaves&quot;/aoe, since those will be dead before reaching them).<br />
<br />
The only other one close to favor &quot;melee&quot; was Festergut and really it didn't favor melee, it just required a number of people in range to suffer from the stun/silence. You could put as many ranged you wanted in melee range without problem.<br />
<br />
Pretty much all the fights in Wrath and Cata can be made without much problem without a melee. There is maybe one or two that can be made without any ranged.<br />
And Cata is even worse than Wrath which was already ranged-centric as hell. <br />
Once again, they have no clue, talk a lot but never do anything (or do the exact opposite of what they pretend their goal is).<br />
The only way right now to put back melee as &quot;wanted&quot; in raids is strip the interupts from all ranged (including healers), and put mechanisms that punish ranged and have them forced to move, and not only melee.<br />
<br />
It's funny how when everyone has to move away, melee have it far harder (they don't dps while moving away, they don't dps while away, they don't dps while moving back.... while ranged can do all of this and usually aren't out of range while away), specially since roughly anything forcing to move out of a zone hits all melee in range, while ranged can easily spread.<br />
<br />
The design is retarded to a point where you can roughly remove all melee without too much problem if you bring their buff to ranged. The game would be impossible the other way around.<br />
<br />
(The most funny example of that are the whole tier of Cata instances, where 70+% of the &quot;unavoidable damage&quot; and 90+% of the &quot;interupt or die&quot; damage ONLY affect melee, and having only ranged means you stay out of range and ignore it. There is dozens of example in the instances througout Cata, it was brought up BEFORE Cata hit the PTR and yet they didn't change a thing, and the first peak on the 2 new troll instances show they didn't change a thing and it's still World of Rangedcrat : Casterclysm all over again... :().<br />
<br />
It's pretty obvious nowadays that most devs that do PVE content are playing only ranged (a few are playing Protadins tank too, a couple a DK but they probably stopped recently seing the nerfs), rest don't play melee or there is a problem with their mental abilities... :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheDesertDragon</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is actually a surprisingly insightful post. Very good job to Blizzard and GC there! This is from a PvP PoV.<br />
<br />
Interrupts are causing a slew of problems for this game. In general, people talk about &quot;too much stuff&quot; flying about your ears, and interrupts are definitely the biggest offender. Like in order to cast against an RLS you need to avoid fear, kick, spell lock, wind shear, grounding, and the rogue using stuns or silences. It's completely unrealistic and it just makes sure you JUST DON'T CAST, period.<br />
<br />
When you can't cast, your instant needs to be improved, turning everybody into instantspammers. This immediately gives ranged an advantage over melee because being instant is the &quot;melee game&quot; - it's what you trade for being melee and not ranged. It can put you, as a melee, into positions where you are infinitely kited. The game starts to feel overwhelmingly simple. &quot;lol he's just spamming instants I can't do shit&quot; Massive bursts happen when people actually do cast, and it feels like the tide just _CAN'T_ turn.<br />
Simiarly, either melee needs a bajillion gap closers and when they finally catch up, they need to do tons of damage. The end result is that instant casts, training one target and massively overpowered instant casts heals become the metagame. People call this the &quot;WotLK syndrome&quot;. Cataclysm set out to fix it. It hasn't, but it's closer than WotLK was. Sadly it also added more interrupts. Without those, we might've been there.<br />
<br />
<br />
2,5 seks cast should be the norm. I dont remember a time where they actually were pvp wise. <br />
tBC. That's what made it great. I played Frost Mage and every time I got a shatter, it made me PvPgasm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Interrupts do have DR afaik. <br />
They do not. Silences do. Interrupts also cannot be trinketed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rather than nerfing the actual cooldown time of interrupts, why not just decrease the lockout time? <br />
They would become meaningless.<br />
I do think removing some of the interrupts would be the best solution. And adding significant cooldowns to the others. In most cases doubling the CD. 45-1 minute, however, is overkill. Utterly overkill.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral druids, the ones using the interrupt, are very prevalent indeed JK! What a spit in the face from Blizzard. <br />
They certainly have become more popular. Whether they are actually popular is debateable, but you'd be a fool to deny that Skull Bash did nothing for Feral Druids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting stuff. What about a cast time on interrupts, say 0.5s? That way you're not punishing raiders for missing interrupts (so long as the boss casts they're interrupting are at least couple of seconds long), and melee in PvP has to sacrifice some mobility for a moment? <br />
It's an interesting idea. It would be pretty cool on warriors, paladins and boomkins I'd wager. Possibly feral as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's to hoping that a nerf to interrupts gives us back the rootbreaking of shapeshifting. <br />
Cannot be emphasized enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
For gods sake, just separate PvE and PvP talent trees and spells already, STOP CHANGING PVE FOR PVP! <br />
There is seperation enough to begin with. Seperating the two games completely would kill the game.<br />
It's high time that PvE takes its rightful place: Where it is in every other game. You design the game to be fun competitively, and then you design encounters using the mechanics of the different classes to create fun and exciting content. I promise you, you wouldn't complain. Heck, you might not even realize it happened.<br />
Every time I see seperation of SP and MP I tend to vomit. It can be fun in some instances, but in others its just shameful. Example where it was fun: SC2. Example where it's terrible: Crysis 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, Greg. No kidding.<br />
<br />
See, there was something the Devs said pre-Cata about development. They said they wanted to end the whole &quot;tank takes massive damage spike&quot; design style and normalize PvE damage.<br />
<br />
Then we got to Cata, and what happened? On one of the first bossfights of the xpac in the dungeons (naga priestess in Throne) she has a one-hit killer that *has* to be interrupted. (I am aware, before you smart-arses reply saying &quot;Oh I can soak that hit now it's no big&quot; that gear has since trivialized it, for a large part. BUT, at the time, when the content was relevant, it was a death sentence.)<br />
<br />
Long story short--Interrupt mechanics on bossfights really aren't that fun, especially when they require a rotation (Nefarian 25, looking back at General Vex in Ulduar, sometimes Halfus Wyrmbreaker 10&amp;25) or when the survival of the entire raid hinges on them. When interrupt mechanics ARE fun in PvE is when they're a sort of &quot;bonus&quot; thing--like interrupting caster adds in Stonecore that stops them from xforming, or stopping a boss from casting a shadowbolt (which wouldn't kill anybody, but it's fun to do!).<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Interrupting in PvE is fun when it's something skilled players can do as a bonus, NOT when all dpsers MUST do as a requirement. I don't give a rip about PvP &quot;balance,&quot; I've long since given up on that. <br />
<br />
Good post. Fires don't kill you instantly. They set you back. Not interrupting a spell kills you instantly. I fail to see how it's a fun mechanic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't make it that high, but sounds like a good partial solution. On raid fights/heroics, interrupts work the same as they do now. But in PvP, an interrupt puts a momentary buff of 15 or 20 seconds on the person interrupted which prevents a second close interrupt and lets that person at least get some kind of spell off.<br />
<br />
There actually are PvE issues with interrupts. I remember, long long ago, I had a mage and was in...I think it was in the Barrens, east of Crossroads, and south of Ratchet. There was a human stronghold (Northwatch?), and the mobs there could chain interrupt, with no cooldown. I was killed in moments, unable to ever cast a single spell. That was annoying!</div></div><hr />

It's not going to work for people with high latency (300 or more). Right now I'm playing on euro server only 'coz my friends and every time its my turn to interrupt on nefarion or other encounters, my back gets cold shivers :). And its much harder in pvp, where screen show you players in front of you, but server think otherwise.<br />
And remember, when casters going to get a lot of haste with next tiers, its going to be much harder for melee to spell lock them.</div></div><hr />

PvP was a complete afterthought during the development and some time after, the PvP that did exsist was world PvP where balance wasn't as much of an issue. Then of course BGs came and then later with TBC came arenas, and to balance BGs and arenas, PvE keeps getting changed or even nerfed.<br />
<br />
And why would a second version of every talent tree that is only active during BGs and Arenas kill the game? They are only tweaked for fair PvP, same talents only tuned. There are a few games that have separated PvE and PvP trees.</div></div><hr />

The side effect is that those same interrupts are used to interrupt a casters' damage spells. From there, they buff instant casts, add mobility, and so on, back and forth ad nauseum.<br />
<br />
So, what if players' damaging spell casts became non-interrupt-able? You'd still be able to use any of the myriad of other CCs that effectively stop casters from casting, just not regular off-the-gcd interrupts. Then you could nerf the instants, and hard cast spells would be more reliable. <br />

Your argument is the same as me saying &quot;Having to avoid standing in fire isn't fun. I should be able to stand in it if I want to. If I feel like avoiding it I could but it shouldn't kill me if I stand in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, a boss that has a mechanic that is designed to be interrupted that kills you when you fail at that mechanic has nothing to do with Blizzard's design goals of tanks not getting two shot. On this boss, if your tank dies, it's because you fail at executing the fight properly.<br />
<br />
Thats not always the case the tank plus myself are the only interrupters in our 10mans on a 10 second cd. Fights like halufus be4 that required heavy interrupting (be4 the change) on top of tank swaping were hectic. We shouldn't be punished for not bringing a rogue/shammy/war. Its poor design to be forced to bring X class to counter X encounter. <br />
Now of course they did dumb down 10mans where 1 10sec cd interrupter can handle 90% of the gimmicks besides malorick an tank handles adds interrupt i do storms. <br />
I like some of the changes because it makes it easier on our group makeups but watering down abilities even more than they have and in this case increasing the cds for our interrupts just goes to show they still fail at class balancing. <br />

<br />
What did he want to accomplish with this? &quot;We know our design is shitty, but we're not going to do anything about it. Just wanted to let you know that we feel ya!&quot;<br />
<br />
The interrupt thing is completely true. As a rogue, I need every kick to kill a decent healer. I need blind. I need gouge. I need kidney shot. So healers can't cast normal spells and rely on instants, so they make instants more powerful etc etc.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it sucks to be interrupted and CC'd a lot (I know it is. I have to get within melee range of a frost mage, so I feel ya). You can have complex and deep combat without all that.</div></div><hr />

The whole point of game development is to take both the long-term outlook and the short-term assessment and reconcile a path between them.<br />
<br />
Sure, having 24-sec cooldown on interrupts, like those of a mage's, would make Nefarian phase 2 extremely hard (if not impossible?). However, the encounter designers would then redesign those spells. The adds would likely have a much longer cast time and cast spells that are NOT Blast Nova. Perhaps a low-damage Fireball that's a bonus to interrupt (since it would prevent the damage) but isn't catastrophic (wouldn't AoE the entire raid)... with a 30-sec cooldown on their Blast Nova that DOES AoE the entire raid.<br />
<br />
As for the healing / interrupting mechanics, many healers are already extremely hard to interrupt. For example, Disc Priests and Resto Druids use almost exclusively instant-cast heals. Their actual cast-time spells have very high rewards: either a Clearcasted Regrowth (which refreshes Lifebloom, heals for a fair amount, puts a Swiftmendable HoT, and triggers Nature's Grace) or a Cyclone (which will CC an enemy for 2-6 sec) or a Mana Burn (which is catastrophic versus another healer). With a 30-second cooldown or 1-min cooldown on interrupts, interrupting the high-risk high-reward spells becomes relatively more rewarding, as does timing it just before or after a burst/stun/silence chain of attacks. However, this would make interrupting the healers with mundane heals (Resto Shamans, and to a lesser extent, Holy Paladins) much harder. To counter this, melee classes could all get mechanics similar to Mortal Strike / Curse of Tongues / Necrotic Plague. These all allow actual healing, but they penalize healing somewhat (not to the extent that makes healing unviable most of the time, as is the case with dispelling+Unstable Affliction).<br />
<br />
For example, Warriors could get that old Improved Overpower Talent: Hitting a casting healer with Overpower would reduce the strength of that healing (or even damaging!) spell by ~50%, or something. Shamans who used to Wind Shear every other spell could now get an anti-healing on Earth Shock: Earth Shock would add 2 seconds to the cast/channel timer on a spell, or something. Rogues could be special: Consuming combo points with a finisher would give a 20% chance per combo point to instantly interrupt any spellcasting... this way they retain their niche as the extremely annoying anti-healer, anti-clothy but they wouldn't automatically disrupt every single cast-time spell you'd cast (like they do now, unless you're 10 yards away and they're stuck in a Frost Nova).<br />
<br />
The opposite side of the interruption argument is lowering the power of instants. It is NOT fair that Warlocks and Priests and Mages have instant-cast AoE hard CC's. While a Warrior or DK or Shaman may AoE slow many people, and a Rogue might apply AoE Curse of Tongues, the cloth classes can AoE stun, fear, and root people in place. These powers come at around 20-40 sec cooldown, which is necessary since melee classes get about 4-6 interrupts/stuns/silences in the same amount of time, and these hard AoE CC's are needed in order to get space to cast/survive. Similarly, while a hard-casted Frostbolt merely deals a respectable amount of damage and snare, a hard-casted Cyclone or Fear or Polymorph lasts long enough to be so powerful that a free-casting caster getting a chain of these CC's off is sure to kill a target without survival cooldowns. Increasing cooldowns on interrupts will increase the frequency of these extremely dangerous long-duration CC's by about 2-3x.<br />
<br />
The solution to that, I suppose, is to further lower the duration of these CC's to Cyclone's level. While Cyclone is arguably the most powerful CC in the game next to Fear, it has approximately half the duration of Fear or Polymorph. It is uncleansable and unbreakable, and to compensate for that, it only lasts 5-6 seconds (less with diminishing returns). It is harder than the other CC's to reapply. If Fear and Polymorph and such casted hard CC's all lasted about 5-6 seconds, similar to Cyclone, then not being able to timely interrupt them (saving the long CD on interrupt for a heal, for example) would balance them out.<br />
<br />
Finally, on the PvE side of things, even on heroic mode Halfus or normal mode Nefarians, letting one interrupt get off will NOT always wipe the raid. It just has a high probability of doing so. I do think that the &quot;supernuke interrupt now&quot; Blast-Nova-esque interruption requirements have gotten out of hand. This annoying interruption theme should be on 1 boss per raid tier at a maximum. A more fun interruption mechanic is on normal Omnotron Defense System / Arcanotron and, to a lesser extent, Feludius in the Ascendant Council. At least only 1 person would be incapacitated if a spell gets off... and if that person is smart and the healers are quick, that person won't die to the raid-wide AoE afterward. If Blast Nova were a 1-mob thing, it wouldn't be so annoying (similar to Halfus). Having THREE platforms with three adds Blast-Novaing is overkill. Having them cast a single-target Fear that makes people run off the platform would be way more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's always been confusing to me why there are so many Interrupt/Silence effects, and Disarms are a relatively undeveloped area. There are all of three classes with disarms, each lasting 10 seconds; all have at least a minute cooldown. There seems to be a big discrepancy here; granted no Silences last 10 seconds, but when their cooldowns are measured in seconds, with the worst being half of the lowest Disarm effect's cooldown.<br />
<br />
Let's say for the sake of comparison that the silence and disarm last the same amount of time, something like 4-5 seconds; which is worse? Not being able to cast from a particular spell school? Or losing your main hand? Getting your weapon taken as a Warrior or Rogue sucks, but not as much as having Holy kicked as a Priest, or Nature kicked as a Shaman. Your damage potential might drop when your weapon gets taken, but you aren't incapable of escape or defense (in most cases). Holy gets kicked as a Holy/Disc Priest, you're dead. Nature kicked as a Shaman, you're done.<br />
<br />
The duration for disarms doesn't have to be 10 seconds like the current examples, even 4 or 5 (more comparable to most Silences), would be sufficient to provide the opportunity for escape. It would add strategy. Do you lead with your Silence/Disarm when focused? Or do you hold it in reserve to allow time to recover afterward?<br />
<br />
&quot;Ignite Handle&quot; is a great idea for Fire Mages. I'm sure there's plenty of inspiration for other classes. &quot;Entangle Weapon&quot; (vines snare your target's weapon, rendering it useless for 4 seconds) would be great for Ele Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is that is a path the dev's dont want to go down, but may end up being the only solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting Idea, but that is just perpetuating the arms race.<br />
<br />
<br />
They've already opened that pandora's box when they made Colossus Smash a separate ability for PVE and PVP. They have it within them to distinguish it. The only reason why they WOULDN'T is because it would mean a complete spell overhaul which would &quot;require too much work mid expansion&quot; and would more likely translate into their next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Casters are at a disadvantage because their main weapon (spells) can be interupted/silenced by every melee class and leaves them basically defenseless. The solution would be to give at least one spec of each spell casters a disarm. Demo locks could have a disarm on their felguard, fire mages could heat the handle of a hilt and force it to be disarmed, ele shammies could shock the weapons free, and Spriests have one. If all melee can take the main weapon of casters (spells) away, then casters should be able to do the same and disarm the melee's weapons for a short period of time. Yin to the Yang, and balance to the force it would bring. Right now it's a one sides battle with melee having the advantage and most casters being unable to return the favor<br />
<br />
Or, you know, give casters a cast time spell that is better than instants but cant be interrupted. Many boss abilities work this way after all....</div></div><hr />

On raid fights/heroics, interrupts work the same as they do now. But in PvP, an interrupt puts a momentary buff of 15 or 20 seconds on the person interrupted which prevents a second close interrupt and lets that person at least get some kind of spell off.<br />
<br />
There actually are PvE issues with interrupts. I remember, long long ago, I had a mage and was in...I think it was in the Barrens, east of Crossroads, and south of Ratchet. There was a human stronghold (Northwatch?), and the mobs there could chain interrupt, with no cooldown. I was killed in moments, unable to ever cast a single spell. That was annoying!<br />
<br />
Okay, maybe I was a bit over-zealous in my initial approach, but the idea is the same. If basically every other player-affecting ability in the game has a cooldown or DR, then why not interrupts? But then again, I would love to see stuns break (and cause the affected player to be DR capped on stuns) after a certain amount of damage. Every other type of CC breaks on damage (besides cyclone, which takes no damage), so why are stuns different?<br />
<br />
As for PVE, I have no idea why mobs with CC's can get away with 0 DR's, especially when those types of CC are long ones with guaranteed durations. I have fond memories of running a friend through ZF and being chain-hexxed for 3 minutes straight. I ended up having to bubble to prevent being hexed longer. Also on the list of worst offenders, are the shoveltusks in Howling Fjord. If you pull more than a couple at a time, you're bound to be &quot;confused&quot; (aka, stunned + walking in circles) for an unknown length of time.</div></div><hr />

Then of course BGs came and then later with TBC came arenas, and to balance BGs and arenas, PvE keeps getting changed or even nerfed.<br />
<br />
And why would a second version of every talent tree that is only active during BGs and Arenas kill the game? They are only tweaked for fair PvP, same talents only tuned. There are a few games that have separated PvE and PvP trees. <br />
<br />
PvP was the original focus of the game. Warcraft 3 had the Horde and the Alliance actually allying, but Blizzard decided to split them again so they could make World of Warcraft what it is. A game with TWO WARRING FACTIONS.<br />
<br />
The problem is that the entire original development team left and was replaced by a bunch of raiding buffoons that completely altered the focus of the game.<br />
Also, the game shipped with Molten Bore and Onyxia. Oh, the amount of effort they must've put into that! Hahaha. PvP basically took a backseat in favor of a design that Blizzard had originally said they didn't want anywhere near the game: Tanking and threat. Funny, huh?<br />
Original WoW was about levelling up and growing your character in the world. PvP was optional, but definitely encouraged even if just for the sport. Battlegrounds made their way into the game after just 2 months, and were in EU at release. So yeah.<br />
The original team designed Guild Wars. A game with more builds than you can comprehend and 10 very unique classes. Its competitive PvP scene stayed alive for 4 years despite no improvements to the game for the latter 3. It is poised to take the world by storm all over again with Guild Wars 2, just you wait.<br />
<br />
The reason why a second version of every talent would ruin the game is because it would leave you confused if you couldn't preview it. It adds another layer of complication - and not depth - to the game. There's enough of that shit going around already because you guys feel that CC'ing shouldn't be something you had to focus on so you can have 1 minute polymorphs. No, God forbid, you need to top that Recount meter, right? It forces Blizzard to homogenize every class because God forbid that you chose your class for its unique style. No, you must all be able to top the meters, and thus all be able to CC equally well, all have similarly infinite resources etc. etc.<br />
Either you'd have to add massive talent tree panes for PvP, which would be completely silly and kill World PvP in Tol Barad as well, or you'd have to just make every ability work completely different depending on who you use it on - ruining the game's persistancy, feel and potentually balance.<br />
<br />
Raiding is completely and utterly braindead in its current incarnation. It's a miracle that Blizzard has managed to make it as fun as it is and really shows off how good they are at simply polishing till it shines.<br />
Underneath it all - and never forget this - you have:<br />
- monsters that attack the guy in plate armor because he's yelling profanity at them, <br />
- monsters that are large enough to simply stomp over and kill you instantly but for some obscure reason chooses not to, <br />
- monsters that don't use any kind of AI to determine what is more dangerous in your group,<br />
- monsters that result in stationary, grinding, repetitive fights you must complete every week (if not for a little gem allowing you to skip them by Blizzard)<br />
<br />
I will never fathom why people found that crap fun in any other MMO, and the only reason I can think of in this one is that Blizzard simply polished it to perfection.</div></div><hr />

Why would we want it go this way instead of heading toward less cc/interrupts/disarms? (btw, interrupts themselves aren't equivalent to disarm. Silence is equivalent to disarm). If they continue this merry-go-round, we're going to get to the point where nobody does anything. Melee sit there disarmed. Casters sit there interrupted or silenced. How is that fun? We don't need more abilities. If anything we need less with a more coherent design behind them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RokFenris</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Basic problem with requiring some ability for 5-mans: it becomes almost mandatory for, at least, every last spec of at least one role. Which is what happened with interrupts: a few 5-man fights required constant interrupts , some times with as little as 5s between them (mend rotting flesh just after one of the other two abilities which needed to be interrupted, before that fight was nerfed).<br />
<br />
One idea to solve the PvP problem with interrupts would be to some times make them the wrong choice. It could be done by adding to every caster some kind of &quot;interrupt bait&quot; channeling skill; something that had smaller DPS than just casting instant spells, but would cause either quite a bit of damage, or else some CC, to any player that tried to interrupt it.</div></div><hr />

Its not that easy. <br />
<br />
Some meleers would be sort of balanced with longer CD on kicks. However some meleers are underrepresented already and nerfing their interrupt NOW without giving them anything in return would crush them PvP wise. Just look at poor ferals, who had to give up root breaking for interrupt. And there are classes, that are sharing interrupts between different specs also, how do you balance that?<br />
<br />
Its funny, even GC admitted Eleshaman is rather weak, but then, he mentions interrupts (and dispells few weeks ago) as a pvp problem, while Eleshaman has basically only 2 exceptional abilities in pvp - Wind Shear and Purge and nerfing them without massively reworking how pvp Ele works would make that spec a bigger joke than it is now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Prevalent, adj.- widespread; of wide extent or occurrence; in general use or acceptance.<br />
<br />
So, yes, with more classes having interrupts, interrupts have become more prevalent. The problem is, teams used to only have 1 reliable interrupt and one long CD one (RMP for example had Kick and CS). Now with all Paladins having an interrupt and Druids having it thrown in, along with Wind Shear and Grounding Totem you can run into a team with 3+ interrupts rolling on short CDs. What has that done? Made instant cast spells and CC the only viable means of CC (or in the case of a Mage, the only possible way to get CC off) and made classes that lack said instants weak by comparison. <br />
<br />
The solution isn't simply give everyone instants, the best solution was listed in this thread: give interrupts a 10 second CD when used against PvE targets and 20-24 second CDs when used in PvP, in line with the Colossus Smash change.</div></div><hr />

It's really not all the difficult to comprehend why stuns have their place. Melee have the disadvantage of needing to be on their target to do damage, giving them a stun to assist with it makes them more viable. Interrupts as well shouldn't necessarily have a DR because they require the player to as well be on the target and expend their power to use it. A better overall change would be to make all CC that causes a loss of control for the character to be on DR with itself, just as all stuns share a DR. <br />

That WAS the initial design of WoW, to be a PvE game. However, the second they started coming out with Battlegrounds, Arenas and now Rated Battlegrounds they absolutely have to keep on top of both now. They can't just come out with all this content and then just let it die off/neglect it.

Strictly speaking in terms of PvP Healing, any healer now can easily make up for that 8 second loss now that there's no 50% MS De-Buff in a few casts once the 8 seconds are over. PvP Healing in it's current form is very VERY powerful.</div></div><hr />

So, what you would be saying is that melee need to be on their target which is why they have stuns, but they need to be on their target to use their stuns in the first place? Besides, ranged having stuns and mobility enhancers (sprint/charge/death grip/etc) negate that argument. I can see where you are coming from, but the end result is just wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When all melee have some form of stun and the only ranged class stuns are available via talents it doesn't negate that fact. Melee need stuns to provide themselves with burst opportunities because they typically lack other forms of CC as well as having a melee range requirement. Yes they have ways of getting into melee range, but that's why ranged have ways of kiting melee. Stuns provide melee time to attack their target without interruption, just as many CC's and kiting abilities provide the same for ranged classes and is an important part of the game. <br />
<br />
Stuns are also taken out of proportion of how powerful they really are due to CC not sharing DRs. Being able to fear then sheep then cyclone someone to take them out for 30 seconds of a fight is what needs to be resolved here, not the ability to stun someone for 6 seconds every 45 seconds. The ability to stun an opponent on top of CC'ing their healer practically unconditionally for 20 seconds makes stuns look overpowered because the player who is stunned can't do anything about it.</div></div><hr />

Make up your mind Blizzard. You didn't see this coming when you gave every ranged class a 50-70% slow to kite all melee to extinction, thereby essentially giving melee the outright NEED for the 10sec interrupts.</div></div><hr />

However, the second they started coming out with Battlegrounds, Arenas and now Rated Battlegrounds they absolutely have to keep on top of both now. They can't just come out with all this content and then just let it die off/neglect it. I'd be seriously pissed and quit the game, as would millions of players who actively enjoy PvP in WoW if they started giving up on the PvP Balance entirely and focused all of their attention on PvE instead.<br />
<br />
Blizzards entire line of thought consist of 'if all the dps classes do nearly the same damage in PvE, they will do nearly the same damage in PvP'. That's why they consistently refuse to make spells function entirely different in PvP. &quot;This is a PvE game, we don't want to have two separate games inside of one&quot;. The problem with this is that any dps nerf in PvE has massive repercussions in PvP, and vice versa to a lesser extent. The solution should be obvious. They already took that plunge when they made all forms of CC have DR in PvP. Just like a Fear can only last 8 seconds in PvP, a dps ability should only do x amount of damage in PvP. <br />
<br />
Example: My Earth Shock may do 6k damage to Sinestra, but should only do 4k to a player.<br />
<br />
Now obviously certain abilities shouldn't have that drastic of a reduction, and there is Resilience which reduces player damage to an extent. But there are some abilities that simply need to do less damage in PvP. Period. The sooner they finally realize that, the better off this game will be.<br />

Instant spells are not the problem. Instant spells that do the same damage as non-instant spells are the problem (Frost Mages, I'm looking at you). The crazy thing is that some classes (Shamans) have ridiculous cooldowns on their only instant cast spells, while other classes (Mages, Priests, etc) have no cooldowns on their instant cast spells, or very limited ones. <br />
<br />
No one likes to hard cast a damage dealing spell in PvP because of the lockout. I fully understand that. So why don't we have spells that can not be interrupted, have a cast time AND have a cooldown associated with them? Has that thought never occurred to the developers?</div></div><hr />

Or, shock horror, what about either nerfing instant casts specifically to BGs and arena to 25% of what they are now, or put diminishing returns on them. Seems everyone wants immunity to interrupts (or a long CD), well why should you (and me) not have DR on our key weapons in our spell arsenals.<br />
If casters want to disarm melee, then build it into a fear. Mages have Blink and other 'freeze' type spells. Maybe Shammys could have it built into ghost wolf - instant transform to Wolf, howls with fear and gets a 5 sec sprint or something. However, there may have to be a &quot;use this fear/disarm/save my arse spell, and X ability is unusable for 5 seconds&quot; for balance.<br />

See, there was something the Devs said pre-Cata about development. They said they wanted to end the whole &quot;tank takes massive damage spike&quot; design style and normalize PvE damage.<br />
<br />
Then we got to Cata, and what happened? On one of the first bossfights of the xpac in the dungeons (naga priestess in Throne) she has a one-hit killer that *has* to be interrupted. (I am aware, before you smart-arses reply saying &quot;Oh I can soak that hit now it's no big&quot; that gear has since trivialized it, for a large part. BUT, at the time, when the content was relevant, it was a death sentence.)<br />
<br />
They've said similar things before previous expansions but then contradicted themselves right after. It happened in TBC with fears and WOTLK when it came to 10/25 raids and I guess now with Cataclysm and the tank damage paradigm.</div></div><hr />

At the very least make his cast longer and weaker on hardmode while a dragon is still up and fighting you so that shadow novas going off are a medium deal until after drakes are down and then they can become a major hindrance if they go off. Or Maloriak, dpsing adds and interrupting lightning storm at the same time, very annoying. Interrupt mechanics are overused on this tier, there should be more like Arcanotron's blast, Hydro Lance, or Terrastara's Harden Skin. If you eat/let a bunch of them through, you're screwed, but if you mess up here and there it's not an instant wipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
------------<br />
<br />
I'm glad Goatcaller (heh) is finally admitting to some of the blunders undertaken by the dev team, but I'm equally saddened by the admission that nothing is going to be done about it any time soon, most likely. That's just plain disconcerting, at best... :(<br />
I do agree that interrupts cause a butterfly effect/arms race in regards to pvp mechanics, and that it bleeds into pve as well; I disagree, however, with the statement that it's a huge and/or cumbersome undertaking to fix it. As others have suggested here, just modestly increase the cooldown on all/some/most interrupts (as opposed to, say, LotRO's 5min cd on interrupts). Throw that into a new patch along with the adjustment or creation of extended cooldowns on boss abilities (to match those of players'), and then later on down the line, in subsequent patches, you can start fiddling with other player abilities -- snares, gap closers, damage of instant-cast spells vs spells with a cast time. Y'know, turn those knobs that the dev team is always talking about...<br />
<br />
And before someone says something about it, the gap between the increased cooldown patch and the adjusted player abilities patch (hotfixes?) is totally acceptable... it might break pvp a bit, but no more than it already is anyway...<br />
<br />
Saying they don't want to change anything like this &quot;mid-expansion&quot; is just simply a cop-out; an excuse to not do the work. There's no difference between whether something changes now or during a &quot;transition&quot; between expansions... the same effort needs to be done, except if it's put off there'll be more content to go back and rework. That is, unless they plan on doing another Cataclysm-like overhaul, where they said &quot;Hunters no longer use intellect!&quot; ...yet there's still intellect on Hunter gear in some parts of the game. Half-assery ftw, amirite?</div></div><hr />

<br />
the game is relatively fine right now outside of a dearth of content. if top PVPers are leaving it's certainly not for rift which is currently &quot;this class/combo 1-shots everyone&quot; imbalanced. the pom/pyro days of WoW are long behind us.</div></div><hr />

Not when half the encounters in the game are designed around having 10 second interrupts, as he clearly states in his post. It's much easier to have an expansion team work on major changing aspects of the game than it is to have the 'live' team work on them when it's something as major as interrupt changes that effect PvE drastically.</div></div><hr />

I think mages should be wizards that are not even interested in sparring some earthly opponents. What Gandalf did? He fought Balrog. What Aragorn did? He fought an army of orcs. These are different things.<br />

I would see proper that give both sides eg. one warrior, one hunter, and one mage. And balance that. For example warrior needs to protect mage while hunter kills the mage of the other side and mage bombards from distance or something.</div></div><hr />

The interrupt thing is completely true. As a rogue, I need every kick to kill a decent healer. I need blind. I need gouge. I need kidney shot. So healers can't cast normal spells and rely on instants, so they make instants more powerful etc etc.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it sucks to be interrupted and CC'd a lot (I know it is. I have to get within melee range of a frost mage, so I feel ya). You can have complex and deep combat without all that.<br />

We do already know what happens when u make an interrupt an instant (mage CS going on the GCD). This happened for a single patch in BC and was immediately taken back off GCD in the next patch. Why? Because it broke the mage class. It wasnt functional because a mage is either casting and doing damage OR (with CS on GCD) waiting for a spell to inerrupt. If they are waiting (while HOTs and mana are ticking ever higher) they are LOSING. Someone did the math and figured out that there was a .1 second window for a mage to wait for GCD to finish and then cast CS on a flash heal that was cast at the same time as an instant damage spell.... this is next to impossible for a human to hit.<br />
<br />
Simply put, instants are part of the game and interrwoven into the balance. Removing them would be somewhat cataclysmic destroying many parts of the game mechanics and pvp interaction and possibly making some classes almost completely irrelevant. PVE is somewhat elementary and somewhat boring IMHO as balancing a dynamic constraint with a static constraint simple. It's when you try to balance many different dynamic contraints as in PVP that things get tough. It then places contraints on the PVE balance.<br />
<br />
The only true balance is have everyone the exact same class. No one would play in that case. However, the issue is much like life, nothing is fair or balanced, it is what makes it interesting and challenging. The debate will rage on and one can only ever pursue balance, but never truly achieve it. You have to appreciate the issue in the right way, not nerdrage and start breaking random objects within reach of your computer.</div></div><hr />

Bosses in PvE don't give a shit about not being able to cast from the same school; it's irrelevant. Interrupts in boss fights are for single-shot spells, every time. Now, against trash mobs, it's different; it's nice being able to lock-out that healer as you're going in for the kill. But that shouldn't mean all of a sudden everyone's wiping on trash.<br />
<br />
By contrast, that would change PvP pretty quickly. If the goal is to lessen the impact of interrupts, then decrease or remove the lock-out time. Or do that for most, with the rare interrupt - a la Counterspell - keeping it. There are ways to tweak it that wouldn't break PvE - they'd barely affect PvE at all, in fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See, there was something the Devs said pre-Cata about development. They said they wanted to end the whole &quot;tank takes massive damage spike&quot; design style and normalize PvE damage.<br />
<br />
Then we got to Cata, and what happened? On one of the first bossfights of the xpac in the dungeons (naga priestess in Throne) she has a one-hit killer that *has* to be interrupted. (I am aware, before you smart-arses reply saying &quot;Oh I can soak that hit now it's no big&quot; that gear has since trivialized it, for a large part. BUT, at the time, when the content was relevant, it was a death sentence.)<br />
<br />
Long story short--Interrupt mechanics on bossfights really aren't that fun, especially when they require a rotation (Nefarian 25, looking back at General Vex in Ulduar, sometimes Halfus Wyrmbreaker 10&amp;25) or when the survival of the entire raid hinges on them. When interrupt mechanics ARE fun in PvE is when they're a sort of &quot;bonus&quot; thing--like interrupting caster adds in Stonecore that stops them from xforming, or stopping a boss from casting a shadowbolt (which wouldn't kill anybody, but it's fun to do!). <br />
<br />
TL;DR: Interrupting in PvE is fun when it's something skilled players can do as a bonus, NOT when all dpsers MUST do as a requirement. I don't give a rip about PvP &quot;balance,&quot; I've long since given up on that.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but that is just nonsense. Interrupting IS fun when done for something crucial, not the other way around. Don't be naive, if interrupting would be optional like your example(s), then no one would be bothered interrupting. That's simply the nature of us players. <br />
<br />
Having abilities split into PVE and PVP variants is a tempting idea but they (the devs) wants the game to feel &quot;unified&quot;:<br />
<br />
Q: Considering how often changes meant to balance PVE performance for certain classes then creates imbalance in their performance in PVP, and vice verse, have the developers ever considered completely separating the two? – Azunya (North America/ANZ)<br />
<br />
A: That’s a common solution proposed by our active forum participants for whom balance may be the single most important concern when they play. You have to put yourself in the mind of a new player just trying to pick up the game though. Already there are a bewildering array of class abilities and talents, many with their own idiosyncrasies or special rules. Now you have to virtually double that if you want all of the player spells to have a PvE and a PvP tooltip. We prefer solutions like resilience and diminishing returns on crowd control that are more global rules rather than virtually every ability having a PvE vs. a PvP coefficient. We want it to feel like one game with a unified set of rules.<br />
<br />
As much as I'm for helping new players to understand the current mechanics, there has to be a reward for the veteran players too, which is starting to grow towards a majority voicing their concerns now.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you should apply. Nevermind the inevitable side effect that healers would be even harder to kill or prevent from healing their teammates. When one considers implementing a change, one must consider every possible effect that change will have, or at least the extremely obvious ones.

If the shaman is causing that many problems, kill them with physical dps or cc them! Speaking as a shaman, it's bad enough that I have to burn a glyph to get my cc down to 35 seconds, if you make wind shear a 30 second cooldown then I've basically got nothing, no role. Hell, without wind shear elemental is even further marginalized. Our buffs are already redundant/autoattack fodder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. I kind of think its a good solution. Granted a lot of work but im pretty sure Activ-Blizz has the money to hire a few more people to see something like this done.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cacodaemon</div><div class="date">2011-03-29, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To toss in a thought with some different direction; why not have lockouts be &quot;spell-specific&quot; instead of &quot;school-specific&quot;? This would allow for (essentially) no changes in PvE, and possibly add complexity (but not overly much) in PvP. The lockout for a specific spell could actually be increased, or otherwise modified, without completely destroying the ability to DPS or Heal. <br />
<br />
A second option would be to provide players with a variant of a PvE Boss ability; hearken back to Ye Olde Days in Naxxramas. Corrupted Mind gave a CD to healing spells that restricted healing severely. Giving players the ability to use something like this (though, a much more limited version) would be less powerful than a pure &quot;school-lockout&quot; from an interrupt, but still powerful in that it shuts down a specific spell for some duration. (A better example might be the adds on Lady Deathwhisper - the curse that adds 15 sec of CD to abilities - though a player version should probably only apply to a single cast.)<br />
<br />
Another thought, specifically in regards to the predominance of instant spells; perhaps a channeled counter? Essentially, it shuts down a single player (the one channeling the instant-counter) to prevent the use of instant spells for some duration of time. Treat similarly to a Potion of Concentration - for 10 sec, a player is helpless and can do nothing, but prevents instant spells from being cast in X area.<br />
<br />
Finally, for the purposes of tweaking, the above 3 ideas can be mixed and matched. Perhaps the &quot;Counter-Channel&quot; puts a long CD on instant spells. Perhaps the CD of the interrupt used matches the lockout time for the spell that was interrupted - which could be used to keep a single spell shut down for a fight. Some overlap would be sensible between PvP and PvE - having interrupt CDs match single spell lockout times, and provide bosses with 2 or 3 interruptable abilities. Having bosses be immune to the CD increasing effects would also be reasonable (just as many bosses are immune to player-based fears and stuns). <br />
<br />
Just a few thoughts to try and keep responses constructive and dialogue-worthy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
playing a caster in pvp, feels dull right now, you cant cast, just not allowed to, there is not just melee interupts, all the casters can silence you, and there are other abilities, that interupt you, like warrior's charge, paladins hammer ... <br />

Your argument is the same as me saying &quot;Having to avoid standing in fire isn't fun. I should be able to stand in it if I want to. If I feel like avoiding it I could but it shouldn't kill me if I stand in it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, a boss that has a mechanic that is designed to be interrupted that kills you when you fail at that mechanic has nothing to do with Blizzard's design goals of tanks not getting two shot. On this boss, if your tank dies, it's because you fail at executing the fight properly.The difference between standing in fire and dying and missing an interrupt is that dying to fire only kills you and not the entire raid. I agree with the other guy that boss instant kills are stupid and not fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feel free to agree with the other guy, but I'm with Leggo.<br />
<br />
First, standing in the fire CAN kill the entire raid. You've never missed an enrage timer with one or more DPS corpse spectating? Or wiped because a healer wasn't paying attention to the ground...again? Don't pretend that a single player's incompetence cannot affect other players.<br />
<br />
Second, I agree that instant kills aren't all that fun, but again, interrupted abilities are a boss mechanic, and NOT part of the insta-gib that Blizz was trying to avoid. That specifically concerned damage output, and is a big reason why tanks no longer need to stam stack. Interrupts as part of a boss fight are integral mechanics, a critical part of proper execution on par with, yes, not standing in fire, kiting adds, CC, OT-usage, et al.<br />
<br />
Third, I do agree that interrupts are more &quot;fun&quot; when they aren't a necessary mechanic. I don't mind watching my DPS suffer a little bit when I know I'm helping the group more by interrupting a caster. With the lock-out period, most trash casters don't have options once you've pummeled them; it's fun as hell to beat on them while they kind of stare at you helplessly. :) HOWEVER, refer back to point two: it's not about fun. If it's a necessary interrupt, then it's part of the intended mechanic. Period. There are plenty of boss fights where interrupts are useful, but not necessary for victory; consider these your &quot;fun&quot; interrupts if you must. But if you would rather not toss in an interrupt when it's necessary...then you really just don't want to raid, do you?</div></div><hr />

Raided in BC, back in the misty days of yore when we were two button wonders stacking strength. (Now we've got a rotation that's so spastic it'd make an arms warrior wince and reads more like programming code than any &quot;rotation&quot;.) I've always been on interrupt duty. Sure, I put out competitive DPS, but the rogues and mages did way more (until the Wrath patch MOOHOOOHAHA) as a result of being a rogue or a mage.<br />
<br />
As such, my interrupt button finger gets twitchy. I see a cast, I mash 4, which, unsurprisingly enough, used to be Earth Shock. I was parked for a long time in Zul'Drak rotating in to help get folks Less-Rabi. I didn't mind. It was utility. It was me puffing out my chest and going &quot;SEE?! THIS IS HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME! IT'S NOT ALL JUST RAW KEYSMASHING DPS AND AOE SPAMMING!&quot;.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh ... wait? I can interrupt that? Ohhhhhh, far out.&quot;<br />
<br />
Interrupts should be part of a PvE mechanic. It's more than knowing when to not stand in bad shit or to pop BL at 40% and burn him. It's &quot;should this spell be interrupted, or is it going to be the next one that'll really hurt?&quot; or something of the sort. PvP? I really have no positive or un-cynical opinions about PvP, considering I'm in the withering camp of pensioners who long for the days of pre-cross server, pre-resilience BGs, where having DHKs and being a persistent douchebag about acquiring DHKs for the rest of the raid got you banned from wPvP. Blizzard has overcorrected, overtuned, and overthought PvP nowadays, and it's evident to me that they're scrambling to fix what they broke in an effort to fix what was broken. Was old PvP broken? Well, yeah, considering the only enemy a warlock had back then was another warlock with a twitchier Banish button finger. But all of these cyclical nerfs and balancing issues and hand-waving are only proof that they're now just slopping more whitewash on a moldering turd.</div></div><hr />

Don't complain about wiping on heroic encounters because your raiders aren't able to do what the encounter is asking them to do. That is the fail on the part of your raiders, not Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Your argument is self-perpetuating. Essentially, you're only parroting ad infinitum &quot;This is hard because it is hard.&quot; You're also basically suggesting that Blizzard can do no wrong in their raid design and are necessarily above reproach, and any and all failure to meet whatever standards they've set is the failure of the players. Nevermind Blizzard hotfixing encounters AS they are being world-first'd...<br />
<br />
The point that I think is trying to be made is that the penalty for missed interrupts is TOO severe in many cases. I'm strongly of the opinion that a single missed ability by one player should not guarantee (please note the emphasis) a raid wipe. It should create stress on the other members of the raid that they may or may not be able to overcome. It should not essentially seal the deal for the entire encounter. An example of a good interrupt mechanic is Maloriak's storm ability. The faster the interrupters are on the draw, the easier it is to make the fight succeed. That said, if they oops it for a second, it does not guarantee a wipe. (Although if they completely snore off in a corner and just ignore the fight, yeah, that'll wipe it.) It could cause a wipe. The healers could also do a kickass save on their end and get the raid back up where they need to be, but that could also cause mana issues before the end of the encounter. It's about everyone's efforts working together, not placing most of the win/lose as a binary on a single ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Halfus 10 heroic can be interrupted by the tank (especially after the nerf and next patch when interrupts can't miss). More to the point, Halfus hc style interrupting is fun. It's stressful, but when you get it done right it feels great - you actually had to pull off something other than just your brainless dps rotation. If you cannot manage things like focus macros and focus cast bars for interrupts then maybe heroic raiding isn't the right thing for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You must not play a lot of high level arenas or RBGs against higher rated teams. Healers are extremely powerful when they are left alone to heal and not CC'd or interrupted. It is never just an 8 second loss to healing. If you get interrupted, that usually means some form of CC + Silence + Smoke bomb is following which ends in a teammate death.<br />

Cataclysm PVP is all about control. CC chains are out of control, and interrupts on a ten second cooldown just add to that annoyance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like, for example, the explicit consequences of having bevies of interrupts that were *just laid out* in the article above?<br />
<br />
Yeah, healers would be harder to kill. I think Blizzard *knows that*, but they still don't like the current low CD of interrupts in PvP because of how it forces people to use instants.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's MAIN ISSUE with increasing the CD is that it would force them to redesign a lot of PvE stuff around a very PvP-centric change. I think they just need to bite the bullet and admit that they have to make spells function differently in PvP. I mean Hell, they're already doing it with Colossus Smash, and it's how ALL long-duration CCs work (mobs get a minute, players get 10 seconds). <br />
<br />
Maybe it doesn't need to be as extreme as a 6 second CD going to 30, maybe increase it to 15 or 20, but it still seems to be the &quot;best&quot; solution to the problem as they've outlined it.<br />
<br />
If they want to make interrupts less spammy *AND* keep healers at the same level of squishiness, that's going to take a much more significant redesign of healing throughput / incoming damage across the board, or they're going to have to up the effectiveness of Mortal Strike-like debuffs to compensate for healers being just that much more difficult to deal with.</div></div><hr />

From launch, you've had your choice of servers, so the Horde vs. Alliance World PvP Awesome Gankfest-o-Rama! only affected players who chose those realms. Many, many players chose to never really be involved in PvP. For a game that was, from day one, &quot;focused&quot; on PvP, that seems an odd option to have for a huge portion of your player base.<br />
<br />
Then, there's balance. Since Vanilla, balance has been geared toward PvE. PvP imbalances are frequent and, often, lasting. Look at how long Warlocks were OPd. Now, they can't get off the mat. DKs completely screwed PvP balance when they came in; in PvE, they were more or less fine (if not a little UPd, in fact). When Blizz finally decided to make Ret pallies a viable PvE spec, it destroyed the PvP balance for quite some time; how long did it take for them to finally nerf Rets down to a reasonable level?<br />
<br />
I know a lot of these examples (minus the DKs, of course) are old, but that's the point. PvP has never been balanced, and never will. The majority of &quot;balancing&quot; that Blizz has been involved with has traditionally been toward the PvE aspect.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention; 2v2 arena is completely messed up, can't play like this, Blizzard should go back to PvP like it was back in TbC, or atleast WotLK.<br />

We're not asking you to extend the cooldown, because that would ruined PvE. We're asking you to reduced the length of the player 'interrupt' so casters aren't gimped. Bosses aren't ever silenced for 8 seconds; they are interrupted for 1 spell only. So make player interrupts shorter. It's not rocket science!</div></div><hr />

Honest to God - what makes YOU think PvE was the original focus of the game and not just something that was shoehorned in because the project was hijacked by hardcore raiders during its development?<br />
<br />
There was little PvP focus in the early vanilla days. Consider these facts:<br />
* Battlegrounds was added half a year later after launch, in part due to the Terran Mill/Southshore PvP which unstablized the servers (as does heavy population in any one area, like the AQ opening event)<br />
<br />
* Arenas were added one expansion later<br />
<br />
* The fact that there are 2 factions is to create tension in a game with a backstory of rivarly between the 2 factions - it creates an atmosphere of danger while you are questing. PvP then was intended to add atmosphere to the game. If you think PvP is meant to be balanced around 2 factions, you'll be wrong because 2 factions will never be balanced, some servers will always have one faction outnumbering the other one in World PvP. Paladin vs Shaman was another imbalance, although this one mainly affected PvE, not PvP. Why did so many video clips of &quot;Frost Shock!&quot; jokes keep appearing on the net in vanilla?<br />
<br />
* There was no need to balance PvP because there wasn't arenas, Battlegrounds focused more on group interaction and tactical movements with BG objectives, not a 2v2 or 3v3 straight up situation.<br />
<br />
* PvP was never balanced to begin with, the damage you deal is directly correlated to your gear. If you were decked in Tier3 Naxx40 gear, you can be the worst player in the world and still kill a person that only raided Molten Core and only had Tier1. Gear had too much of a factor in PvP in terms of player health and player damage late in vanilla, that's why PvP was born an expansion later when they introduced Resilience and Arenas, so that footing could be evened out. The fact that the PvP gear then has seasons, is intended for it to catch up to PvE gear as PvE gear grew in strength over each tier of content. PvP has always revolved around getting gear - If you have less resilience and health, you will get killed far easier.<br />
<br />
* PvP Balance only comes in when both parties fighting have similar levels of gear, this is made possible by arena points, but if you couldn't reach 2200 rating, you couldn't have similar levels of gear to begin with. A good number of PvP players felt that trying to &quot;catch up mid season&quot; is too difficult for this reason.<br />
<br />
<br />
All these facts are clear indications that PvP was never a focus of the game, PvE is. Prior MMOs to WoW never needed PvP balance either, because they didn't have arenas. Balancing Faction vs Faction PvP is quite a different thing from balancing game classes.<br />
<br />
To some of the people who left WoW for Rift, you will be in for a real shock - Rift has 32 subclasses and since you can pick and choose 3 any subclasses together to form your spec, certain combinations are overpowered - Rift's PvP is way more unbalanced than WoW was in vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with interrupts is that if a player screws up once using their main arsenal of hard cast spells, they are locked out of alot if not all of their survivability abilities (nature being their heals, barkskin, instant ghost wolf, root, cyclone.) The huge problem with interrupts is they simply lock out way too many spells, defensive or offensive. a disarmed warrior can still pop a shield or fear or leap away, a interrupted elemental shaman can...frost shock the melee to be as slow as they are? I think the best solution would be to unlink the &quot;schools&quot; of damaging spells from defensive ones.<br />

I think Blizzard should make double dps for 2s more possible.. Very few combos working with double dps, usually there's one op dps and a healer. Matches lasting for 30 minutes and not really fun.. Double dps for 2s should be possible to play with without getting pwnd by some, warrior/rogue/mage/dk/druid, or whatever with a healer running back and forth from the pillar spaming shields, hots and heals that takes less then a second to cast :rolleyes:<br />

Do not mind the numbers below too much. They could be tweaked.<br />
<br />
Silences would function like Spell Lock:<br />
- Silence for X sec, and if it affects a casting target it also locks that school for twice the silence's duration.<br />
Interrupts would no longer lock schools, instead would do 2 things:<br />
- Cause a 1 (ws), 2 (kick) or 3 (cs) sec pushback on the affected spell.<br />
- Apply an undispellable debuff slowing the cast speed of spells from that school by 20% for 4 times the pushback.<br />
<br />
Note: The ongoing spell would just be delayed a bit, but not be slowed.<br />
Note#2: Those who decide to cancel the delayed spell to cast a new one would probably feel it is only worth it to cast instant spells, albeit with longer GCD.<br />
<br />
Hardcasting in front of a rogue would no longer be a dreaded concept, but still carry a decent risk.</div></div><hr />

For most of wows existence, wipes were always the fault of the tank or healers. I like that the difficulty of encounters has progressed to this point.. raids are much more fun now.<br />

Honestly, Blizzard needs to just get rid of Arena. In large scale battles, interrupts are not as magnified. This game is just too complex to ever hope to balance 5 man pvp.

<br />
Eeeh.. Stick to 10 v 10? By that I assume you mean rated battleground. Anyway.. 5 v 5 arena won't ever get balanced, it's basically about which team that got the highest dmg, and may be able to throw off a quick cc or 2. When I talk about arena I think of 2v2 and 3v3. 2v2 isn't balanced atm, 3v3 Could also get improvements, but the idea of removing arena is something out of thin air.. If Blizzard had even considered removing arena from the game, they would have a huge loss of players. You get surprised by the actual amount of people playing arena. When I first started playing I played only PvE, but as soon as I got the taste of PvP and got sick of the countless wipe after wipe each and every evening at the same damn encounter, I got addicted and doesn't really play PvE anymore. I think this is what happens with most of the players going for PvP, we get tired of wasting our time dying at the same encounter, with a huge bill and a pissed off guild master punishing us for the rest of the week :p PvP and arena is popular cause of the fair reason that it's a new challenge every time you enter a match, and you actually don't really know what will happen during the fight (As you do in PvE) :cool:</div></div><hr />

Casters are at a disadvantage because their main weapon (spells) can be interupted/silenced by every melee class and leaves them basically defenseless. The solution would be to give at least one spec of each spell casters a disarm. Demo locks could have a disarm on their felguard, fire mages could heat the handle of a hilt and force it to be disarmed, ele shammies could shock the weapons free, and Spriests have one. If all melee can take the main weapon of casters (spells) away, then casters should be able to do the same and disarm the melee's weapons for a short period of time. Yin to the Yang, and balance to the force it would bring. Right now it's a one sides battle with melee having the advantage and most casters being unable to return the favor<br />
<br />
Um, we can't interrupt you if we can't reach you, isn't that the Yang to your Yin?</div></div><hr />

I will write an example for balance druids (because I am one of them)<br />
<br />
Starfire has 2.5 seconds of cast time.<br />
Druids tend to never cast it in pvp because they are trained 24/7<br />
<br />
The solution relies in the name: starFIRE, change the spell to a channeled one like Mind Flay and use the actual starfire animation played over 2.5 sec instead of the actual brief moment when the spell cast end.<br />
<br />
Btw this could not be applied to every 2.5sec spell...<br />
How to fix it then? It's easy, one word: DEBUFF<br />
<br />
When a rogue, warrior, dk, hunter, etc successfully interrupt a spell cast, apply a debuff on the interrupted person with something that prevent him from being interrupted or silenced.<br />
This spell should be applied only on Players and not NPC (this is something you can do without too much efforts) this way the interrupt ability is still on a 10sec cooldown, but the player cannot be interrupted for 20 seconds or so, acting like a cooldown increase only in PvP, leaving PvE encounters untouched.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's nice to know that they see the problem and are willing to own up to it, but it would be nicer to know that they had some way of doing something about it. You're probably right, though, in that fixing this wouldn't be possible without triggering an even worse &quot;butterfly effect&quot;, and they seem to have learned (somewhat belatedly) that all the hotfixing was doing more harm than good. For better or worse I think that the fundamental paradigm of the game is stuck as-is for the foreseeable future.</div></div><hr />

The issue isn't that interrupts have too short a cooldown, it's that they're too easy to get off successfully. With 30 second or so cooldowns they'd be absolute trash.<br />
They're so easy to get off because the spells with cast times have such godawful looong cast times. 2.5 seconds is terrible, and they use it as the norm.<br />
They don't have to lengthen the cooldown on interrupts, they just have to speed up the cast time on cast spells. Roughly 1 second should be the &quot;norm.&quot; You can't move while casting no matter how short the cast is, as long as there is one. Even a half-second cast would prevent you from being able to kite with it.<br />
<br />
Guild Wars was built on PvP and had much of it mastered, and this is the basic way they handled interrupts; they had a 10-15 second cooldown, and spells had an average of a 1 second cast time. Some went as low as 0.25, but on the other end even 2 second casts were extremely rare, because they were too easy to interrupt!<br />

True true, too long cast time at some spells, even though I play affliction mostly with my warlock, and after all.. Affliction is a &quot;drain&quot; spec, I would love to fire off a shadow bolt or two now and then when we're about to kill, but then.. When I got about 1300 haste and the cast time of shadowbolt is about 3 seconds, that just pisses me off. Specs like affliction have no chance to actually go for a finishing blow on the enemy, and need to just keep dotting for ages, hoping that the teammate (usually healer) get's tired and mess up after a long long fight. Ofcourse we got drain life and drain soul, but it takes a pretty long time before the first drain soul to tick after you actually cast it, and drain life doesn't really do any dmg.. Then again we can discuss that affliction is a crappy crappy spec atm, too low dmg, and no way to punish people just dispelling everything of themselves. (We got unstable affliction, but in Cata it hits for shit, and silence for 4 secs, making them perfectly available to dispell til they get, let's say; oom, bored, or stopped)<br />
<br />
Wasn't really here to complain about affliction, but what I'm saying.. Too much cast time on some spells :(<br />
I wonder how it would be if Blizzard made spells cast for like 0.25 secs, I can smell a lot of damage to my keyboard while constantly hitting the buttons :p</div></div><hr />

The problem with interrupts is that if a player screws up once using their main arsenal of hard cast spells, they are locked out of alot if not all of their survivability abilities (nature being their heals, barkskin, instant ghost wolf, root, cyclone.) The huge problem with interrupts is they simply lock out way too many spells, defensive or offensive. a disarmed warrior can still pop a shield or fear or leap away, a interrupted elemental shaman can...frost shock the melee to be as slow as they are? I think the best solution would be to unlink the &quot;schools&quot; of damaging spells from defensive ones.<br />
<br />

<br />
Disarm is a joke. A 10 sec loss of MH weapon, with a 1 minute cooldown? Worthless. Who are you kidding, you don't play a warrior...esp if you are against interrupts.</div></div><hr />

Interrupting IS fun when done for something crucial, not the other way around. Don't be naive, if interrupting would be optional like your example(s), then no one would be bothered interrupting. That's simply the nature of us players. <br />
<br />
No, that's the nature of BAD players. For me, it's a thrill when I'm on my rogue and I can maintain high dps, my own recup stacks (self-healing, assisting healers), and still interrupt non-lethal spells like shadow bolts/etc (assisting healers AND tanks). I enjoy playing him to his fullest potential with cc/etc without seeing the all-important recount #'s dip down significantly.<br />
<br />
Quite a few people responded to my post (I guess that's the benefit of being on the first page, before Forum Exhaustion sets in).<br />
<br />
1) A few pages back someone responded with, &quot;Standing in fire doesn't wipe a raid. Missing an interrupt does.&quot; Excellent point.<br />
2) &quot;Interrupts are a necessary mechanic, if you fail at them then you fail at the fight.&quot; --But that right there is my point. It's not fun to fail at a fight over something like that. It's frustrating. Extremely so. Example: 10 Omnotron hc. Arcanotron is up and in a power swirly. Tank's interrupt misses (due to not being hit capped, at least they're changing that in 4.1), and then on my DK I go to interrupt it--but there's lag between Mind Freeze casting and actually hitting (which is horrendous design imo) causing the interrupt to be too late. The nuke goes off and one-shots a healer who is already taking damage from Magmatron. You can call that example a perfect failstorm--but it's happened, more than once. It's just not a good mechanic. I can allllmost understand situations like that being in heroic modes because, let's face it, they're supposed to be extremely challenging, but I don't see their place in the regular modes, if anywhere. I stand by my original opinion--it's poor, and lazy, design. You can slap a nuke onto any boss to increase the difficulty, but it doesn't make it fun. <br />
3) Someone responded saying that they felt accomplishment on General Vex (Ulduar) by getting the interrupts perfected--to me, I never got that sense of accomplishment. It was an annoyance from the first pull to the eventual downing, and the only real reason they included that was because they felt that non-mana users (most melee) had little to do in the fight. It was an afterthought, and one that didn't really even fit with the boss' design/theme. It happened way too frequently (see also: Halfus) to make it feel clandestine. It felt routine, but not quite fail-proof-routine enough to make it second nature.<br />
<br />
(As a sidenote, what's with Maloriak interrupting his own addcasts/etc due to fight timing? Very poor design, once again, imo.)<br />
<br />
You know what a good example of a fun fight is? And I'll probably get picked apart for this, but whatever. The final fight in the Crucible of Carnage (against the flame ascendant). That fight has it all: a soft enrage, lots of fire to not stand in, and a non-nuke cast (fireball) that is interrupt-able. I did it for the third time last night on my ret pally that I've been leveling and I thought to myself, THIS, this is what fights should be like. It wasn't enough for me to just DPS him--I made it a goal to interrupt every cast I could. It wasn't required. Hell, it was probably a waste of a button-click. But it was fun.<br />
<br />
I am not asking for content to be impossible to fail at. I'm asking for it to be more creative. I can see, from the typical forum-posters' hubris on MMO-Champ, where the confusion might easily arise, however.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your argument is self-perpetuating. Essentially, you're only parroting ad infinitum &quot;This is hard because it is hard.&quot; You're also basically suggesting that Blizzard can do no wrong in their raid design and are necessarily above reproach, and any and all failure to meet whatever standards they've set is the failure of the players. Nevermind Blizzard hotfixing encounters AS they are being world-first'd...<br />
<br />
The point that I think is trying to be made is that the penalty for missed interrupts is TOO severe in many cases. I'm strongly of the opinion that a single missed ability by one player should not guarantee (please note the emphasis) a raid wipe. It should create stress on the other members of the raid that they may or may not be able to overcome. It should not essentially seal the deal for the entire encounter. An example of a good interrupt mechanic is Maloriak's storm ability. The faster the interrupters are on the draw, the easier it is to make the fight succeed. That said, if they oops it for a second, it does not guarantee a wipe. (Although if they completely snore off in a corner and just ignore the fight, yeah, that'll wipe it.) It could cause a wipe. The healers could also do a kickass save on their end and get the raid back up where they need to be, but that could also cause mana issues before the end of the encounter. It's about everyone's efforts working together, not placing most of the win/lose as a binary on a single ability.<br />
<br />
Eloquently stated with a great example of what I'm talking about.</div></div><hr />

Not against interrupts, and you're either a terrible troll (disarm is worthless?) or you failed to read the post correctly. I was suggesting a temporary fix for pvp that wouldn't make it impossible for interrupting and the interrupted classes to protect themselves (the interrupt cd would be unchanged, but casters would be able to actually use some defensive skills).</div></div><hr />

Fake cast is just a guessing game, if they opponent is smart enough, you cant fool them.<br />
Anyways, PvP diminishing returns on interrupts is indeed the easiest solution. You can still do the cc + interupt the healer -&gt; go for the kill thing, but it prevents a caster sitting around firing only instants when a hostile shaman or healing paladin is standing next to him</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ComputerNerd</div><div class="date">2011-03-31, 03:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fake Casting is a tedious mechanism and oversuggested &quot;solution&quot; to overcome what is admittedly a problem in pvp.<br />
Blizzard are acknowledging that which you cannot.<br />
Spending extra time on casts which will achieve nothing vs a competant player who can then still lock you out of two simultaenous casts is not a solution.<br />
Diminishing Returns are not enough when the cooldowns are still short enough to allow overlapping where it can be ready to use again before the first interruption has ended. They are still chained.</div></div><hr />

<br />
America is a capitalist society: if something doesn't work, you throw more money at it until it does.<br />
<br />
While I think many of us welcome some transparency with regards to class development, I think most people are getting a little weary of essentially paying to beta-test a game whose fundamental flaw of trying to concurrently balance PvE and PvP is doomed to failure, and has been failing, and continues to fail, to the chagrin of many. <br />
<br />
Instead of satisfying some kind of quorum, very valid complaints continue from folks many of whom, again based on feedback, seem to be more competent, at least at the design level, than those currently enjoying a salary to perform that very task.<br />
<br />
Of course it should be within the scope to fix these problems within the current expansion! Is World of Warcraft created in a sweatshop by underpaid, under-educated, understaffed laborers, or is it the aim of the company to deliver a quality product?</div></div><hr />
