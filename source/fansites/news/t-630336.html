The official notes (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html) have been updated with most of the changes deployed in the last few builds. There is a bunch of new important things here, it also seems that Enchant Weapon - Titanguard (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/titanguard.jpg) has been removed from the patch (it was reduced from 75 stamina to 50 in the latest build). <br />
General<br />
Racial Resistances: These can now be mitigated against by gaining additional chance to hit.<br />
All Silence spells now have diminishing returns. This includes: Arcane Torrent, Garrote silence effect, Improved Counterspell effect, Improved Kick effect, Silence, Gag Order, Silencing Shot, Spell Lock, and Strangulate.<br />
Dispel Resist talents have changed to protect only beneficial spells and damage over time effects.<br />
Shield Wall, Barkskin, Guardian Spirit, and Divine Protection are now off the Global Cooldown.<br />
Reputation rewarded for killing mobs will no longer automatically deprecate. This means trivial mobs will continue to give out their full amounts of reputation on kill for the majority of cases in the game (level 70 creatures in Stratholme, for example, will continue to award the full amount of rep to level 80 players seeking to boost their Argent Dawn faction).<br />
World of Warcraft now supports 3-D imaging. Visit http://www.nvidia.com/object/GeForce_3D_Vision_Main.html (http://www.nvidia.com/object/GeForce_3D_Vision_Main.html) for more information.<br />
The Darkmoon Faire vendors have new items now that trade routes into Northrend have been better established.<br />

Anti-Magic Zone: This ability’s duration has been cut to 10 seconds. <br />
Killing Machine: Instead of a chance to be triggered on critical strike, this talent now has a chance to be triggered on each swing based on the swing time of the weapon (slow weapons more likely, fast weapons less likely). <br />
Mark of Blood: The total amount of healing this can grant is now capped based on a percentage of standard creature health at the target’s level. <br />
Shadow of Death: The duration has been changed from 45 seconds to 25 seconds and now has a 15 minute cooldown. <br />
Summon Gargoyle: Damage dealt by the Gargoyle reduced by approximately 20% and maximum duration cut to 30 seconds. <br />
Wandering Plague will now properly reset after being castand now considers the resilience of the target in determining its chance to be triggered.<br />
Vampiric Blood (DK) changed from 20% health / 50% healing to 15 % health / 35% healing.<br />
Will of the Necropolis will now reduce the damage of any attack that takes the DK below 35% health by 5 /10/15% instead of boosting armor when wounded. It no longer affects the cooldown of Anti-Magic Shell and retains the current damage reduction bonus. <br />

Blue posts<br />
We've got a bunch of important blue posts here, changes to Howling Blast for Death Knights and Vengeance for paladins, Q&amp;A for Paladins and Druids ... Some of these posts also mention changes from the latest notes update.<br />
Pure DPS Classes and raid content difficulty<br />
From our POV, hunters, mages, warlocks and rogues are pure classes. All other classes are hybrids. Priests are hybrids because they have a viable dps spec.<br />
<br />
The problem for dps essentially comes down to the fact that there are many more dps trees than raid slots available. Healers by contrast are needed in greater proportion as you go from 5-player to 25-player content. If the average 25-player raid has 6-8 healers, then all 5 healing specs have room, and we try to make sure a raid that brings them all feels rewarded for it. (We also try to make sure that a raid that has only say Holy paladins does not wipe repeatedly on every encounter.)<br />
<br />
Now, one thing you need to remember is that the current raid content is undertuned on purpose. It's easy. We wanted a lot of players to see Naxxramas and not to hit a brick wall when they tried to graduate from heroics to raiding. But you need fewer healers for easier content and swapping in more dps can just speed up the whole run. (Naxx can be done pretty quickly, but it's not Karazhan).<br />
<br />
Ulduar will be more difficult and bringing more healers will be the norm. The only downside is it will shine a harsher on light on any class imbalance and players will become more concerned about not getting a spot.<br />
<br />
We think the new system is a big improvement, especially compared to the way groups had to stack for Sunwell. Let me be clear though: it's not perfect and we're going to have to continue to improve situations where a dps or healing spec just doesn't bring enough to the table. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14318867545-whats-good-for-the-goose-is-for-the-gander.html))<br />
<br />
RNG Stuns<br />
We have been waging a long war against random proc stuns. We managed to clean up several of them when we changed mace spec, but like vermin, they sometimes crop up again.<br />
<br />
The Death and Decay glyph and Starfall with Celestial Focus were the two greatest offenders because they affect multiple targets. We will almost certainly be phasing out the single target random stuns (such as the Starfire stun of Celestial Focus and Blackout) as well. We didn't do that yet because it involves changing several talents and in some cases we will need to provide compensation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318707167-remove-rng-stun--buff-damage.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/deathknight.jpg Death Knight (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Howling Blast cooldown changed to 5 seconds<br />
I believe the cooldown is 5 seconds now, so at least it should mesh a little better with 10 second rune cooldown.<br />
<br />
We knew there was a risk in taking the Howling Blast cooldown off. Unfortunately, we saw dual-wield DK numbers as high as ever even with the Killing Machine and Gargoyle nerfs. It typically only happened when the DK was fighting multiple targets, which suggests Howling Blast is the right thing to change.<br />
<br />
We still agree that a cooldown makes rotations more awkward, and we will continue to look for an implementation that lets Howling Blast be off a cooldown without all death knights feel like they need to DW Frost or go home.<br />
<br />
(And no, we can't buff other DK specs and other classes to 7000 dps or whatever to compensate.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318937445-gc-howling-blast-cooldown-not-needed.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/druid.jpg Druid (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=700) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid))<br />
Starfall<br />
If you are a druid who doesn't like Starfall, we have noted your feedback. Starfall is area effect damage that you don't have to channel. That is it's purpose. If it isn't doing that job, we can buff it. But introducting an overpowered and frustrating PvP mechanic is not a good way to fix the spell. We removed the de-stealth for the same reason. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318707167-remove-rng-stun--buff-damage.html))<br />
<br />
Developer Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14318876511-jump-wave-gc--druids-have-questions-too.html))<br />
1. Is any attention being given to how bad many Druids perceived Replenish? Maybe uping the returns of mana at the very least? <br />
Yes, it is dreadful. Totally agree. <br />
<br />
2. Is any attention being given to how bad many Druids perceive Living Seed? Living Seed is very low on overall healing for 3 talent points mostly because it is based off crits, which outside Regrowth aren't a Druid's strong stat, it is over-heal the majority of the time.<br />
I don't think Seed is nearly as bad as Replenishment. We get caught in this cycle sometimes where a class says &quot;I don't want X stat&quot; so we give them a talent that uses it and then the response is &quot;now you are making me want a stat I don't want.&quot; That's overly pithy to describe the situation, but it does come up a lot. <br />
<br />
3. Is any attention being give to how bad our PvP survivability is? We can't stay in Tree if a warlock is around. We can't CC if we are in Tree. If we aren't in Tree we lose our armor and melee tear through us faster than if we are in it. Lifeblooms that cost about 1500 mana to stack to 3 are being wisped away by DKs without so much as a thought or bloom. The regen in what PvP gear is accessible to losing teams is terrible. The numbers show Resto Druids are the worst Healers in arena atm. Yes even worse than priests. <br />
PvP survivability is not something we want to address on a class by class basis at this point. A lot of players feel they are dying too quickly. Going through all the talent trees to offer survivability doesn't get at the root of this concern. As an aside, non-tanks often skip survivability talents anyway unless they are borderline OP in PvP. We are trying to bundle more of them with offensive effects.<br />
<br />
4. Haste and Crit on our gear is pretty useless to us after a certain point. Once we reach the Haste softcap for raids, which is pretty low, we don't need that anymore. Crit is also pretty situational as it will only really affect Nourish and we don't get enough Crit on our gear for it to be a substantional boost to the spell. Perhaps Haste affecting Hot Ticks. Perhaps Crit affecting Hots - yeah i am dreaming on that one, but can u tell us why not?<br />
Honestly, there is a technical limitation that prevents hots (and dots) from being able to crit. We are removing that limitation though, so who knows. Haste and armor pen are things we put on lower level gear to make it lower level gear. Higher level gear will be more suitablly optimized. <br />
<br />
5. Poor Idol choices. Currently there is 1 for lifebloom and 1 for rejuv. Any hopes of getting more for other spells or perhaps less specific idols? <br />
We will try and add more. Typically these need to go on vendors (though not always) since they are so spec specific (and therefore prone to causing frustration when they drop). <br />
<br />
6. Why can't we cast thorns in Tree Form? <br />
We want druids to be shapeshifters so we constantly struggle with how much to allow them to do without shifting. Feral and Balance have a lot of the same questions. <br />
<br />
7. Why can't Trees cast Barkskin while silenced. Trees do have bark afterall. <br />
If you have bark, then why do you need more? Seriously, this is something we are considering. <br />
<br />
8. Having more than 1 Tree in a Raid usually only happens if there is a lack of other healers. Any input on what can be done about Trees stacking better with eachother? Like a boost to Hots if another tree has one up on a target?<br />
I am not finding this is a general rule (one tree per raid) except for groups that just tended to keep the same players they had in BC. Except for paladins with their weird buff stacking mechanics (something we are looking at) I do see plenty of concerns from all classes that there isn't enough reason to bring more than one of them. Yet, that was kind of the point. All things being equal, we would prefer you to bring a diverse group (to avoid raid stacking and get everyone into the raids) but we don't want to overly penalize you if you cannot for whatever reason. <br />
<br />
[...]<br />
I did not say your hots will just start critting in the next patch. I said we had the technology to do that if we think it is necessary. We would certainly have to nerf Resto in other ways to compensate for those higher healing numbers. (Source (http://))<br />

Aspects off the GCD<br />
Our intent is that they are all off the GCD but have a 1 sec shared cooldown. I know we have gone back and forth on this. It happens. Sorry for the confusion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318936923-gc-aspects-still-on-gcd.html))<br />

High damage against undead in raids<br />
<br />
Paladins being better against undead and demons than other types of creatures is a problem, especially when the current content has a lot of undead and the next tier will most likely have far less. <br />
<br />
Assume for the sake of argument that the damage you do in Naxx (at 3 Vengeance stacks) is the damage we want you to do all the time. You don't need to invoke &quot;but if we are good in Naxx we will be just okay in Ulduar.&quot; That is a design problem you don't need to worry about. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318637232-gc-justification-for-reverting-5-stack-veng.html))<br />
<br />
Vengeance stacking<br />
It should only stack to 3 instead of 5. If the tooltip doesn't reflect this, it will be updated in a future patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/14318906868-bugvengeance-no-longer-stacks-5-times.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/priest.jpg Priest (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=640) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?priest))<br />
Developers Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14318637025-gc-direct-priest-questions-only.html))<br />
1) Power Word: Shield and Divine Aegis current do not work properly on Feral Druid, Shadow Priest and Shaman targets under certain conditions. This is a major bug that undermines the ability of a Discipline priest to heal these classes. Is there are fix in the works? Timeline?<br />
This bug is fixed in 3.0.8 to the best of our knowledge.<br />
<br />
2) There is a similar problem with Guardian Spirit not triggering for Feral Druids. Is this related?<br />
Same.<br />
<br />
3) Both Hymn spells are woefully inadequate and underpowered. Are there plans to look at these spells? Timeline? <br />
Yes, I have said before Hymns are near the top of our list of priest issues. <br />
<br />
4) The Shadowfiend has significant usability issues both in PVE and PVP. It has very low health and dies quickly, often does not attack the intended target, and is just an overall clunky and difficult to use mechanic for mana regen. Are there plans to replace/alter this ability? Timeline? <br />
We are not going to replace the ability, but we do want it to do what it was designed to do, which is restore your mana. <br />
<br />
5) It has been stated that the party only mechanics of spells are not what Blizzard wants or intends to carry forward. Are there plans to alter the party only nature of PoH and Holy Nova? Timeline? <br />
That is our eventual goal. You can't just take a party spell and shift it up to raid level without making other changes. It would be too overpowered at its current numbers, and if we deflate the numbers, it wouldn't do it's job, particularly in 5-player groups. Therefore both will require tinkering to change them. We don't view these as critical issues so they are low on the list. Holy Nova is slightly higher. <br />
<br />
6) Power Word: Shield and Divine Aegis are staples in the toolbag for a Disc priest. Both of these have issues when there is more than one priest on a target. Shields and Aegis overwite eachother and reduce the procs on them to the priests (mana regen). Is there a plan to look at stacking these? Timeline? <br />
I posted about this recently. It's probably easier if you find the quote than have me dig back through the data (or I won't have time to get to all these other questions). <br />
<br />
7) Renew and PoH and Holy Nova seem to have too high a mana cost for their effect. Are you planning on looking at the HPM values of spells post-CoH nerf as these will be used far more often now? <br />
I don't think PoH is a bad spell, though it is interesting that priests tend to either use it often or never. Holy Nova and Renew likely could use some higher numbers. Renew is still a decent spell though. I don't think it is &quot;take off your bar&quot; level. The coefficient may be too low or perhaps not enough talents affect it.<br />
<br />
8 ) Lightwell, for all of it's paper effectiveness, is just not getting used. Can it be looked at? Change the mechanic? Remove it completely and replace it? <br />
It's tough because it provides an amazing amount of healing but the damage-dealers are often too stubborn to use it. We're not sure if that means the spell needs to change, because it could easily be the kind of things that players figure out, particularly once the PvE content is more challenging than it is now. Changing your target is annoying and something we'd like to fix. <br />
<br />
9) With the change (or lack of fix) to Reflective Shield, it is now a PVP only ability. Was this the intent or are we still looking at a potential change in the future? <br />
It is not the intent, but it's a technical limitation. As you suggest, the spell has not worked for some time on other players. We just changed the tooltip to reflect that. We do eventually want to change it to affect other players once we get new tech from the programmers.<br />
<br />
10) Maintaining Inner Fire due to charges is not fun. Are there plans to remove the charges or change the upkeep mechanics? <br />
We totally understand the ongoing concerns about the spell. Players never want short-term buffs. Left up to them all buffs would go to a 30-minute duration or even just a passive benefit up all the time. We don't think buffs that require so little maintenance are really buffs at all though -- they just become passive bonuses. So when we talk about this spell, we quickly get into this issue. Very short term buffs like Battle Shout suffer the same problem -- players would make them long or passive in a heartbeat. But aren't we really just removing spells from the game when we do that? <br />
<br />
11) Improved Divine Spirit seems lackluster compared to Flametongue totem. Can we look at this and balance it? <br />
I would be surprised if this portion of the Discipline tree looked the same in 3.1. I'll leave it at that. <br />
<br />
12) The utility of healing priests in raids is limited. Fort and SP can all be buffed by a shadow priest, Mass Dispel and Shackle has use only in specific situations and Spirit requires only a single Disc Priest. From my perspective, adding a stackable raid utility to the healing priest would go a long way to ensuring their inclusion in raids. Can you give us your thoughts on this?<br />
We don't want any spec to feel so mandatory that they always earn a raid spot. That goes counter to our design. It is impossible to design a system where all 30 specs bring unique buffs such that you bring one of each to a 10 or 25-player raid. Therefore we went in the opposite direction where you can get the buffs you need without bringing specific specs. There are a few exceptions, but those are also things we are likely to iron out. <br />
<br />
13) Discipline does not have the same bonus healing talents that the holy tree has and therefore presents an issue with scaling. As gear increases, the effectiveness of Disc compared to Holy decreases. Is this the intent? Maybe move some of the holy bonuses lower on the holy tree so Disc can get them? Your thoughts? <br />
I don't think Disc can fill it's role with shields alone. They are cool, but the spec also needs to be able to throw down some single-target healing that is close to paladin level. There are a few different ways we can accomplish this. Overall we are thrilled to see Disc getting so much attention in PvE (it has been good in PvP for a few seasons), but it's not quite there yet. <br />
<br />
Note: A timeline would be really useful, even if it's a guesstimate. I want to know whether I should keep going on my priest, or leave her on a shelf and play an alt. I realize alot of these issues aren't &quot;class breaking&quot; but when it comes down to it, if I am going to be of more use to my guild by playing a different class, I would rather just level an alt, rather than waste time playing my priest. <br />
We are always very reluctant to provide timelines. No matter how often you add &quot;if all goes according to plan,&quot; &quot;at this time,&quot; or &quot;assuming nothing changes,&quot; it has been Blizzard's experience that players only focus on the date and then feel disappointed, frustrated or even lied to if we miss that date for any of a number of reasons. Many of the things I mentioned are things we are looking at for 3.1. I can't tell you when we think 3.1 will ship and there is certainly a possibility that some of these changes might not make it for any of a number of reasons (including triage of more pressing matters, missing tech or bugs that are difficult to fix, making a bad situation worse and so on). All of this leads to the inevitable Soon(tm). <br />

Totems, totems, totems?<br />
In this thread, we are looking for feedback on totems as a mechanic. This question is more open-ended and higher-level than some of the topics we bring up for discussion. You can explain what you don't like about totems, or how they would work if it was up to you.<br />
<br />
There are only a couple of ground rules:<br />
<br />
For purposes of this thread, please confine the discussion to totems and don't list everything you would like changed about the shaman class. Don't review talents or other spells. Just talk about totems.<br />
<br />
Totems are a class-defining feature for the shaman. We are not going to remove totems and we do not wish to marginalize them. We are totally open to ideas that make them cooler, however. <br />
<br />
To clarify, I meant margnizalization in terms of the feature. I have seen proposals before that were basically to pull every spell off of totems and just let shamans ignore them. We don't want totems to be a secondary class feature like pickpocketing or lockpicking. They need to be front and center, more like (to use the rogue example again) posions, combo points and stealth.

Warlocks, which spells do you never use?<br />
Feel free to explain why or just list the spells. Typical explanations might be something like &quot;The damage isn't competitive&quot; or &quot;I can't afford the talent points.&quot;<br />
<br />
For purposes of this thread, please confine your discussion to this specific question and don't belabor the point with other class issues. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14318777313&amp;sid=1))<br />

Every time you use an effect of the same type, it will last less long untill the victim becomes immune.<br />
For example a first fear will last 10 seconds, a second one 5, the third one 2.5 seconds and after that he's immune.<br />

This is mostly a pvp thing, but in pve it works for stuns as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Curse of Doom, Curse of Wrecklessness, Curse of Weakness, Enslave Demon, Eye of Kilrogg, Sense Demons, Soul Shatter, Searing Pain, Soulfire, Hellfire, Ritual of Doom, Health Funnel (Demon Armor - lose of 300 Spell power). Summon voidwalker - Pretty useless since I don't raid. Curse of Exhaustion only because it's too far down to get (should be available to all locks). Multiple curses on target should be permitted. <br />
<br />
Remove damage from shadow fury and make it an 8 second stun. That would allow you to create some distance from enemy since locks , though quite immobile, are being forced to retreat since they cannot compete with burst damage and high sustained damage.<br />
<br />
Significant increases to pets...thanks, but the end result will still be death by rogue, pally, mage, death knight, druid, warrior etc., etc. <br />
<br />
Demonic Circle works for snares: I can count the number of times I've been snared while pvp'ing on 1 hand. Now if it worked while stunned - then you'd have my attention. Still shouldn't matter much to the rogue. He can just stun again, then kill ya. You can't run away from rogue. He can catch ya while you're on an epic mount. He just might have to push a couple more keys. <br />
<br />
<br />
Define &quot;Changes we got in for 3.08 were mostly designed to help locks survive longer in PVP&quot;. Five seconds longer means an increase of 33 - 50%, depending on class attacking.</div></div><hr />

(Naxx can be done pretty quickly, but it's not Karazhan).<br />
Best speedruns I did in Karazahn at 70 were around 1 hour 50 minutes with loads of T6 geared players and optimizing groupsynergy, pulls, buffs etc. Currently Naxx-10 clears are already at the 2 hour 30 min mark and we don't even have T8 or T9 yet.

Indeed, shadow priests are very fine in pve. With the insane mind sear scaling we have become the best aoe class basically. But once you step into pvp you get ripped a new one instantly, even with ALL the pvp talents available, even with hybrid shadow specs.</div></div><hr />

We think the new system is a big improvement, especially compared to the way groups had to stack for Sunwell.<br />
<br />
<br />
So Blizzard has decided to remove yet another aspect of the game: the design of raid compositions. No need to make sure your raid has a balance of different types of healing classes, just bring holy paladins!<br />
<br />
<br />
Mimimi.<br />
<br />
The whole point of the raiding composition change in Lich King was that you can raid with people you like (aka your friends) rather than taking that 5th shaman who is a complete idiot and has less than 500 dps, but still brings Bloodlust / Heroism so you'd take him over another wellgeared, -played, and -mannered rogue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Progress minded guild won't recruit the shaman because he doesn't know how to play - casual guild won't recruit the shaman because he's an idiot. Either way he's not going to be there to take your raid spot.<br />
<br />
The whole point of all the raiding changes in WotLK is to make raiding accessible to players who can't or won't put any more than a minimal amount of effort into the game. Which in itself is perfectly understandable.<br />
<br />
What is not understandable is just abandoning the people who like putting time, practice and intellectual effort into raiding and building raiding guilds. The hardest encounters should be designed so that they force the raid to have a good class balance, rather than just bringing all holy paladins. Optimizing raid compositions is one aspect of the game that brings enjoyment to some people - incidentally you really don't want to drive those people away from the game because they're the people who organize and run most of the successful guilds.<br />
<br />
There should be content for people who just want to have fun with friends, and there should be content for people who want tough challenges. There are people in this game who build and run complex simulators to figure out the optimal pieces of gear to wear, and there are those who pick their gear based on how it looks. There used to be content for both groups, why can't there be in the future as well?</div></div><hr />

You have 1 open raid spot for tonight. There's a good rogue in your guild who would like to come. Now you just take him. In TBC you wouldn't because he didn't bring the buffs a shaman would, even if the shaman was an ass.<br />

Yes it has. It was a great idea to redo Naxx as an entry level raid for people who have never raided before. Ulduar does not exist yet, whatever has been said about it might or might not be true.<br />

Did you raid anything beyond Kara/ZA in TBC? Do you know how melee groups were built back then? The situation you're describing just didn't happen in reality. It didn't happen in the specific scenario of shaman/rogue, and it didn't happen in the general scenario with any other classes. And even if it did, it wouldn't justify removing the raid composition aspect from the game.<br />

I call shenanigans. In Sunwell you would absolutely take another lock over boomkin or ele shaman. You would absolutely take another enh shaman over a cat druid. You would absolutely take another resto shaman over a disc priest. There were classes/specs that were okay, while some were amazing and others blew goats. And it led to seeing certain specs stacked over and over again.<br />
<br />
It was unacceptable. It wasn't about careful raid composition, it was about MANDATORY raid composition. You pretty much HAD to have X of Y class or you were going to wipe. Not enough resto shammies in your guild? Five feral druids? No warrior tank? Only one shadow priest? Yeah, you guys weren't going to be progressing...<br />
<br />
There's a difference between optimizing your raid and having minimum requirements, and BC endraiding crossed that boundary.<br />
<br />

For PVE:<br />
<br />
Paladins being better against undead and demons than other types of creatures is a problem, especially when the current content has a lot of undead and the next tier will most likely have far less. <br />
<br />
Assume for the sake of argument that the damage you do in Naxx (at 3 Vengeance stacks) is the damage we want you to do all the time. You don't need to invoke &quot;but if we are good in Naxx we will be just okay in Ulduar.&quot; That is a design problem you don't need to worry about. <br />

Very short term buffs like Battle Shout suffer the same problem<br />
Warriors dont have to keep up BS in PvP to gain some defense. Maybe commanding shout for extra 2k hp, but warriors have lots of armor. Priests don't. Having to rebuff Innerfire every time its charges has been used up/buff faded is a thing many priests forget to do.<br />

What are you arguing here? That every spec should be raid viable? Of course there were classes like cat druids that you wouldn't take simply because they weren't a raid viable spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It wasn't about careful raid composition, it was about MANDATORY raid composition. You pretty much HAD to have X of Y class or you were going to wipe.<br />
<br />
Funny, I seem to recall the outcry when some first kills in sunwell were gotten by stacking warlocks and no melee at all. Only to have a second kill the next day with a completely different composition. Sure many compositions would have no chance of success, but there were plenty that did.<br />
<br />
Finding those compositions is one of challenges that should exist in bleeding edge raiding. Later on the instances can be progressively nerfed for guilds that cannot get their compositions right to the extent that is required. I am NOT saying that every raid should require it, I'm saying the bleeding-edge should.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a difference between optimizing your raid and having minimum requirements, and BC endraiding crossed that boundary.<br />
<br />
BC end-game raiding wasn't a static thing. Sure to be among the first to down bosses in Sunwell you had to have not only the raid composition right, but a million of other things as well. That's a challenge that some people thrive on. However, after these people had killed the bosses the place was nerfed so that more people could see it. It was a good system that made sure every type of player had something to see. Granted it did not mean that every player could see Sunwell, but it did mean that every player could've seen the first boss or two in BT for example - something new for everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

When they remove the POINTLESS spells then they can add in more spells that are more useful. The people that learning to play the class still use these spells because they think they actually work. In this case, casting less spells is mastery of the class.</div></div><hr />

The best weapon enchant for paladins is still potency (not greater, not superior) for 20 strength which turns into 10 block value and some other threat. That really is a joke. At the very least they need a 40 strength enchant for one handed weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Inner fire started with no charges. The problem was that in classic it was almost to overpowered. You could arguably stack this buff with all the other buffs to give priests insane armor compared to leather and even mail wearing classes. Some people started point this out and that is why it was nerfed to its current version. The problem is that since then the other armor buffs and leather and mail armor have totally out scaled divine fire. Divine fire with charges is a horrible design and a lot of people don't bother using it. I've had it for many levels on my level 30 priest and I've never bothered to keep it up since I got it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard got over 90% of the population paying for content for the other 10% of the player base. So did that 90%. Learn to adapt to that. There is no reason for such insane requirements. That being said, having certain composition as compared to other composition should BENEFIT the raid, but it is already that way. In almost every single fight in raiding right now it is still much easier to stack ranged dps than actually worry about melee.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
So you honestly think its a good system when 90% of the player base pays for 10% to have &quot;hardcore only&quot; content. That is pure and utter crap. Good thing Blizzard no longer agrees with you. It only took them four years to realize it. Also, setting it up so you had required class make up to progress through certain content then nerfing it so you could do it with pretty much everyone the month before the next expansion is a freaking joke. Most people I knew stopped doing anything but Karazhan after the nerf because learning the new content for gear that would be replaced in a month was pointless.</div></div><hr />

What's the point of having spells like that if you can never use them once on the mobs where they'd matter, but the ones able to be slowed or feared, you'd never need to use on to begin with...<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems like they went out of there way to end the soloing of group quests in Wrath. That was a stupid change imo. Soloing group quests if you knew how to play your class well was one of the funnest parts of WoW. On the other hand, having any decently geared 80 class help you on the quests made them completely duo-able (even the 5 man quests).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought I made a clear point for the &quot;insane requirements&quot;: There are people who enjoy the insane challenge. That doesn't mean all content should be insane, just the top level raid. And yes, I did adapt to the new model - I stopped paying Blizzard. I'm not going to pay when I don't get content for my money.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So you honestly think its a good system when 90% of the player base pays for 10% to have &quot;hardcore only&quot; content. That is pure and utter crap. Good thing Blizzard no longer agrees with you.

<br />
That's how flat rate pricing works. If you don't like that you should be calling Blizzard to add pay-per-hour pricing.<br />
<br />
The point that I've been trying to get across is that everyone should have content. The number of players in this game is huge and thus the range of different play styles is huge. There are people who spend hours and hours in this game every day, and there are people who play a few hours per week. There are people who analyze every last aspect of their class, spec and gear, and there are people who click their spells. You cannot possibly expect everyone to see everything, and you shouldn't. Hardcore or casual, everyone should have new content to play in. Since hardcore players play more they will need more content than casuals.<br />
<br />
Sure, you can get rid of the hardcore players and only cater to casuals. The problem is that the hardcore community does add immense value to the game in a huge variety of ways (as does the casual player base too). They're the ones pushing Blizzard to keep innovating with new content, they're the ones driving the in-game economies (both as high level crafters and as the final consumers of many raw materials), they're the ones writing and testing addons, they're the ones who bring a stable structure to the player-base of servers, and ultimately they're the ones who serve as a goal for many casuals.<br />
<br />
The big nerf before the expansion is not what I'm talking about. There was a series of progressive nerfs to all raiding content, coupled with addition of easily attainable high level gear. All this meant that players at every level could keep advancing in the raid content through the whole expansion. That model allowed Blizzard to make raids that everyone could enjoy from the hardcore to the casuals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think you're misinterpreting.<br />
<br />
It's not instant threat it's excessive threat.<br />
<br />
Here's a real-world... well, in game scenario from earlier today:<br />
<br />
Prot Pally + Me, 2 manning Ony, as we always do, for fun and profit and humor. Still in Phase One, I'm letting the pally build a big lead just for safety sake. I start nuking.<br />
<br />
After a bit, pally is sitting at 190k threat and I'm getting close at around 174k threat. The plan was to drop MI so I could hard nuke Ony into Phase 2 without dropping Invis as an aggro shed.<br />
<br />
I popped MI. Instantly, my aggro was at 214k and the paladin's only at 197k. Ony turned, ran towards the MI's and ate all three of them. Then turned back to the paladin.<br />

This has happened a couple of times where instead of 'hiding' me from the aggro table and allowing me to hard nuke for a bit, it spikes my threat and the mob goes off the tank and straight for the MI. It's happened in Ony's Lair, Violet Hold, Utgarde Keep and Gundrak, just to name a few. <br />
<br />
I believe that is what they are fixing.</div></div><hr />

---- World of Warcraft now supports 3-D imaging.<br />
<br />
I liked the idea of it and wanted to try it out but apparently people who tested it in WoW have negative comments. It forces you to focus harder and your eyes get tired really fast. you can read the whole articile here <br />

I hope it saves you some money before you decide to go 3D.<br />

The two effects that stand out the best right now are the out of screen effects in World of Warcraft and the volumetric smoke and lighting in Left 4 Dead.</div></div><hr />

Had this enchant gone live it would have become THE enchant for nearly all tanks. It would not have been an interesting choice. We would have had to keep introducing higher tiers of the same enchant, or else players would just keep using this version for perpetuity. We put Stamina already on many items. We don't think your weapon needs one as well. I received messages from several tanks for very prominent guilds asking us to please not go forward with this enchant. They understood why it was bad for the game. <br />
<br />
Death knights have access to superior enchants in part because they do not have a shield or ranged weapon slot and the stats provided by those items. <br />
<br />
The PTR is for testing. If you find yourself frustrated that things change between the PTR and live, I would suggest you stop paying attention to the PTR notes. Even if a change like this had already gone live, we probably would have changed it anyway. We did not like what this enchant would have done for the game.<br />
<br />
very poor :( ... well, everything has been said in the thread.</div></div><hr />

If they're going to be thinking about what enchants tanks should and should not have, could we at least have some implemented? A block value (sort of a potency, though 10 BV doesn't seem like much. Could just be me), a dodge proc (granted, mongoose halfway is one), or a 2% damage reduction? Something other than 10-level-old enchants?</div></div><hr />

no<br />
you just can play wow with real 3d effects using the new nvidia setup with special monitors and glasses (details on how this roughly works: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarized_glasses)<br />
<br />
if you have red/blue or red/cyan 3d glasses (this is called anaglyph method: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaglyph_image), you can play wow in 3d already with the driver from iz3d (http://www.iz3d.com/) availible on their download page (http://www.iz3d.com/t-dcdriver.aspx). apart from the color distorting this gives you, it's the same effect as with the nvidia setup. the 3d effect is pretty deep and looks awesome, but with optimized red/blue you lose alot of colors and with plain red/blue you lose alot of image brightness in blue heavy (nighttime) or read heavy (ragefire, backrock) environments.<br />
<br />
nevertheless, if you have such 3d glasses, you should give it a try.</div></div><hr />

This is incorrect, Glyph of Raise Dead generated 20 RP upon raising the ghoul and was a minor glyph. <br />
<br />
The Glyph of the Ghoul, a major glyph (and I believe unchanged) grants the 20% strength bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't the honor cap 75k? At least i had my honor capped for 75k and i wasn't able to get any more.<br />
<br />
Edit: somehow checked the cost as 100k. My bad.</div></div><hr />
