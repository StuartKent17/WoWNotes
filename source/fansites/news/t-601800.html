Update : It's out on some places.<br />
General<br />
There are concept arts of Dalaran and The Nexus both look pretty cool. The Nexus looks like this huge purple beam of magic shooting towards the sky, with rings surrounding ilooking like islands (magic rings, where the level 80 5 man instance will be)<br />
Metzen says he doesn't want the end of Arthas' story to be predictable, as he says a &quot;Yeah, that's pretty much what I expected&quot; type of feeling.<br />
Metzen feels the Burning Crusade never really had an &quot;ending&quot; moment. Killing Illidan wasn't it because he didn't like the Legion either. So Sunwell will be it<br />
The Blood Elves are trying to reinvigorate the Sunwell using energy ported from Netherstorm (i.e. the Mana Forges), but supposively rebuilding the Sunwell is an excuse to summon Kil'jaeden.<br />
There is that quote that someone posted earlier in the forums that Kil'jaeden is not fully summoned, thus you can kill him with 25 lvl 70s.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zones<br />
Dalaran will have one or two instanced dungeons in it (like Stockades or Ragefire they said).<br />
Dalaran won't have Auction Houses or class trainers again (*sigh*). Same reason as with Shattrath. It will probably have portals like Shattrath though, and they said possibly one to Shattrath as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
Sunwell area will have &quot;tweaker Blood Elves, high on magic&quot; and 6-8 bosses.<br />
Info about Utgarde: will be similar to Ramparts, but with more memorable moments to break up the &quot;pull-rest-pull-boss&quot; structure of other instances (way they put it). One is a giant flame forge that kills you if you step into it, but if you kill the workers operating it, it dies down. Another is a guantlet area like in Shattered Halls. One boss will be a Lich, another will be a Vrykul who summons scourge minions.<br />
There's a map of Utgarde Keep (low level dungeon).<br />
It mentions the Stratholme CoT dungeon (which isn't new news but it's recent at least).<br />
There will be more &quot;micro dungeons&quot; (i.e. non-instanced dungeon-like areas.. I guess Deatholme is probably a good example). One is called Gjalerbron where the Vrykul are working side-by-side with Liches.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Death Knight<br />
One idea for the Death Knight class is that you'll start in Stratholme and have to break your way out.<br />
Two Death Knight spells mentioned: Army of the Dead (the one from the trailer) which summons a bunch of undead minions, and Death and Decay, which is an AOE spell.<br />
One idea for an ability is Blood Boil, a damage-over-time ability that after the duration lights up two of your blood runes.<br />
Generally Blood runes are damage-oriented, Frost are control-oriented, and Unholy are utility and DOT mechanics.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Inscription<br />
Inscribers will be able to sell scrolls.<br />
Only a handful of core spells can be inscribed. Example they used was you cannot extend the range of the Priest's Mind Vision, but you CAN extend the duration of the Hunter's Freezing Traps. <br />
<br />
<br />
It seems that Games for Windows (http://global.gamesforwindows.com/en-GB/) will have a few more information concerning Wrath of the Lich King, actually it seems that WoWinsider (http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/08/26/wotlk-zone-list/) already got a zone list (including levels) from here. Be careful because nothing is confirmed yet, even if the list look accurate, it could totally be a fake. According to the cover, it will have information concerning new dungeons (but it was probably printed before the GC) and &quot;The Real Burning Crusade ending !&quot;, which could mean a Sunwell Plateau preview. <br />
<br />
Wrath of the Lich King Zones<br />
Howling Fjord (68-72)<br />
Borean Tundra (68-72)<br />
The Dragonblight (71-75)<br />
Zul'Drak (73-76)<br />
Grizzly Hills (74-76)<br />
Azjol-Nerub (74-78)<br />
Sholazar Basin (75-78)<br />
The Storm Peaks (77-80)<br />
Icecrown Glacier (77-80)<br />
Lake Wintergrasp (Outdoor PvP)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, if there is really anything new in it, we'll know soon enough. <br />

Shaman changes<br />
Not too distant future ... Hidden 2.2 changes or very fast release of 2.3 ? Chose the one you prefer. <br />
<br />
The enhancement shaman will be getting some love in the not too distant future. We'll talk soon. Despite this truth, the state of the enhancement spec isn't anywhere near as bad as you proclaim. <br />

<br />
It's not like they can postpone the 2.3 patch forever, if they release WotLK during January, we're basically 4 months away from the expansion, that's 16 weeks to release Zul'aman, the new dungeon, and the leveling curve changes. <br />
<br />
As a reminder, the 2.2 patch went live on PTR July 13th ... 2 months ago ... I expect patches to arrive much faster now.</div></div><hr />

As I understand, entrance to Azjol-Nerub located in Dragonblight and zone itself completely underground, meantime on development maps, shown on Blizzcon, there is one more zone in the center, exactly where Crystalsong forest supposed to be.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-08-27, 08:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, it's called &quot;3.x patch featuring Crystalsong Forest and Emerald Dream&quot;</div></div><hr />

Releasing a new dungeon 2 months before launching the expansion sounds a bit mindless to me, although this time there probably won't be a &quot;raiding killer patch&quot; similar to 2.0. Still, January is a bit too early. Has the closed beta started even yet? For TBC it started mid-August if I recall right (NDA was lifted in early october) and it's soon September.</div></div><hr />

Dont compare it with TBC this is WOTLK and it can be different....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because that I hope 2.2. and 2.3. will come out soon after another. But time will tell, we can not do much more than waiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I know (nowhere in my post I stated 2.3 = Sunwell), but a fast release of 2.2. and 2.3. should decrease the time until 2.4. ;)</div></div><hr />

2.3 will be there probably in 2 months. <br />
2.4 around xmas.<br />
<br />
March 2008 maybe but I rather bet on Q2 2008 unless they will release unfinished content like with TBC and we will need to wait another 3 months for 3.1 fixing patch again :x I really hope they won't fuck up this time, if they do that will cost them a lot.</div></div><hr />

pretty sure you can come to a real battlegroup like stormstrike, ruin, or bloodlust and learn to play cause im pretty sure all your pvp is trash if they are owned by enhancement shamans. seriously this is a statement made by someone from a horrible pvp server/battlegroup.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We have a enhancement shammy who is better geared than my rogue and he does about the same damage when in a group together. The only thing here is that he is buffing my damage and I do shit all for his...<br />
<br />
In PVP id prefer an enhance shammy over a rogue in 5v5... you get totems, more armor, more range on your slowing spell and some slight heals. Rogues you get 5 seconds of stun before you get aoe'd the crap out of... or you get targeted and then die anyways.</div></div><hr />
