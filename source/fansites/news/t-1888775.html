Blue Tweets<br />
is there no longer a vendor to buy conquest gear with honor after achieving the &quot;wild conquest&quot; achievement?<br />
Correct, those vendors no longer exist. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/657267132707639296))<br />
<br />
Will Champion's Honor work in Season 3 or is there a new version coming? I'd like to know if I should use it or save it.<br />
As stated in the item's tooltip, Champion's Honor is only usable in Warlords Season 2. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/657267273703424000))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
In an mmo, what do you find more enjoyable? Spontaneous short small group activities or scheduled longer large group ones?<br />
I enjoy them both. If I had to choose, the scheduled events mean I don't have to hang around waiting for something to happen. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/657240101311881216))<br />

<br />
The problem is mostly that once BRF was released, there's no reason to do Tarl and Drov UNLESS it's for Pepe. Rukhmar has a chance to drop a unique mount (lets pretend the stamina gemcutter doesn't exist), while Kazzak drops gear usable in HFC (except that shitty leech/speed/avoidance trinket), and felblight to generate extra gold</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a simplification.<br />
<br />
My problem with the pre-Kazzak bosses (I never bothered killing Ruhkmar, and only killed Drov once is that they're out in the middle of nowhere; you have very little reason to visit those zones on a regular basis, s simply getting to them felt like too much of a faff, especially pre-flight, for gear that would be outdated quite quickly. Kazzak is in a zone that people are more compelled to visit, and he's less out of the way, and the gear could easily last until the end of WoD.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PuppetShowJustice</div><div class="date">2015-10-30, 11:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think a bigger problem with the world bosses nowadays is that their loot lists are crap. My guild used to make an effort to kill things like Nalak and the Celestials in MoP together early on in new raid tiers because getting people tier armor was a nice way to jumpstart set bonuses for people outside of the actual raid zone's loot drops.<br />
<br />
Nowadays it's just necks and stupid crap that doesn't have any value to anyone who plays in an organized raid. I can sort of understand not wanting to put tier armor on world bosses but they did absolutely nothing to prop up the world bosses in WoD. You can't even get advancement on quest drops for your legendary ring -- which would be a really simple way to have increased player interest in killing them along the life cycle of the expansion. <br />
<br />
But nope. All we got is Pepe, a bunch of really crappy gear, and a tiny tiny chance at Ruk dropping a mount.</div></div><hr />

In Mists, I'd take my alts every week for celestials because they dropped good loot, and it was very convenient. It's not so bad now with flying but trying to find a group/wait for everyone to get there was a pretty significant time investment every week. I killed them once on my main for the achievement and that's it.</div></div><hr />

It's the amount of active characters on the armory. You think 5 million people are playing in the west and zero play in china? lol!<br />
<br />
Let's get something straight here.<br />
<br />
<br />
For an Armory to be 'active' it needs to update.<br />
<br />
For it to 'update' a player needs to actually log in and play their character.<br />
<br />
Let's not forget the fact that ONE PLAYER could have multiple characters they play, up to a potential of 11 (realistically, at least 2/3 characters) , higher if they own two accounts.<br />
<br />
That means, in the US alone, the total ACCOUNT NUMBER is somewhere in the range of: 172k active players &gt; 1.9 million players. <br />
<br />
Even if you're the biggest optimist on this forum, that maximum figure is impossible. ( a % of all total accounts WILL have more than one active character).<br />
<br />
Then, to get an active representention of ALL CHARACTERS to calculate ALL ACCOUNTS, the same needs to be done for the EU armory and OC and EAST servers (who have different armories)<br />
<br />
As a general rule of thumb, EU has always had a higher playerbase than the US (around 10% higher), again the same logic applies for their numbers.<br />
<br />
then, EAST is even higher than EU, not sure how much higher. But let's just say it was equal to or greater than EU numbers.<br />
<br />
US = 172k&gt;1.9m<br />
EU = 189k&gt;2.1m (rough estimate)<br />
EAST = 200k &gt; 2.5m (rougher estimate)<br />
<br />
you're talking about a MAXIMUM total CHARACTER BASE of around 6.5m, but that number can be anywhere in the range of 590k&gt;6.5m. when we boil it down to ACCOUNTS.<br />
<br />
A REALISTIC number of accounts is 6.5m / 3 (since most players have 1-3 active characters) and many have MORE THAN THIS and some have LESS, so this is an average. <br />
<br />
That's 2.1 million active accounts in total</div></div><hr />

It's the amount of active characters on the armory. You think 5 million people are playing in the west and zero play in china? lol!<br />
<br />
If warcraftrealms.com is even remotely accurate, then currently over the last 30 days. US has 1,265,293 and the EU has 551,872 = 1,817,165. I would say the 1.9 million is rather accurate, but then I am on two very heavy pop realms and the amount of people I current see in and around every zones like Tanaan or even throughout the various old content zones from those realms has simple shrunk with each passing month and I am sure most of those people are using the token to continue to play the game or at least a very large portion.</div></div><hr />

Note Chaud did not say CHARACTERS. This means he's accounting for accounts thus 1 account = 1 player. For players that have multiple accounts, even 3 accounts = 1 player. I have 3 accounts but I only count once in Chaud's data.<br />
<br />
2.) Each account can have up to a potential 50 toons. There are people who play on multiple servers. I myself play on 3. I also have well over 50 toons across my 3 accounts. I still only count once in Chaud's data.<br />
<br />
3.) The info Chaud collects is from the NA and EU armory. He doesn't look at the Asian data. If he did, then he could just make a graph that shows how many players are on the NA, EU, and Asian servers on a regular basis so we can see how many really play in a given region.<br />
<br />
Achievements connect characters to an account so the only way for an account to be counted multiple times is if you only have character achievements turned on. Most players don't bother with that feature (or know of it) so most players will only be counted once. The number that would know of it and use it so they would thus be counted multiple times would be fairly insignificant.<br />
<br />
So 1.9 million active accounts for the west (excluding Asia) is entirely feasible. That equates to around 950k accounts per NA and EU if the two are 50-50 ... which isn't likely (especially after Apexis pointed out it's likely closer to 1.2m for the US and 500k for the EU). Not sure how many servers there are, but if there's like 200, that means about 6000 players per server which seems about right since some servers have far more and others far less.<br />

Certainly tell it's the calm before Blizzcon when there's not much to report on, though. Guess we can hope Blizzcon actually drums up interest, but I'm not really buying it this year. I bought into WoD's hype at Blizzcon even though I didn't get the expansion until a month after release. Not falling for that again. I'm looking at anything announced with a skeptical eye. Until the expansion's released, ANYTHING can get the chopping block or get changed to not be what I thought.</div></div><hr />

This falls in line with Wowcensus' charts - 1.8 million active players this week. Their charts show participation to be at the depths of the lowest SoO levels. That doesn't show accounts active but not playing, but it's a good ballpark to work with. My hunch is that they maintained their sub numbers last quarter, maybe even gained some, as people went to work on HFC. This current quarter, tough to call - Blizzcon will spur some renewed interest, the holiday events will bring some back, but the game is entering the long wait phase in a serious way - people are finishing up for the expansion, and there's not much to keep them there, if they don't pvp. They were smart to put heirlooms on Garrosh in MoP, i'm surprised they didn't do it again, to prop HFC up longer - god knows they need it. <br />
<br />
It will be interesting, though. I don't care, myself. I'm kind of over WoW at this point, i'm out of the game for 10 months now, and I haven't had that itch to play again. I'd be surprised if Blizzcon does that, honestly. And, if there are major changes from what they announced before - which is possible, given the reality that they announced stuff before they'd really developed it - there's going to be more torches and pitchforks next month. It's kind of inevitable, really, the relationship between Blizzard and WoW players is so broken down and dysfunctional, they could announce the perfect expansion, and the usual subjects would still throw a fit. I think for a too-large percentage of the WoW player base, complaining about things like LFR IS playing WoW, for them. The only thing they need is Apexis crystals for doing their MMO Remove LFR dailies.</div></div><hr />

That's a valid point about Heirlooms on Garrosh, although I am still salty that you can't go back and get them (I never managed to get them on a couple of my alts).<br />
<br />
I suspect Blizzcon will bring more Legion hype and the currently-silent hype machine will start churning daily.<br />
<br />
In terms of playing the game now, I'm thinking pre-expansion Legion event will bring some back, along with proposed changes...valor being brought back, etc. Kinda slow on that, though. Tough to motivate people to gear up this late in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know the garrison gets blamed for everything in WoD, but it had waaay more to do with the fact that they dropped shitty gear so they weren't worth the effort (especially pre-flying). MoP world bosses dropped legit gear (including tier) plus every one of them had a mount on the loot table. <br />
<br />
Heck even with the derpy bird mount Rukhmar could only muster 40% and people usually freaking line up to grind 1% drop rate mounts. Blizz weighing in on the whole 'scrubs don't deserve decent gear' argument was at the root of a lot of WoD's ills.</div></div><hr />

I would love for there to be an Astronaut Winston, an Autobot Bastion, and a WoW Troll version of Lucio, complete with accent and different music. The skin could even be called &quot;Luc'io&quot;. It makes me wonder what &quot;customizable&quot; exactly means. Does it imply that you have your full skin/outfit, and you can sort of mix and match the different articles of clothing and whatnot? So like, I could wear the hat or chest piece of one skin and the boots/pants of another if I felt like it? If so, that would be awesome and a million times better than any hats TF2 has to offer! Especially if the skins come in alt. colors like HoTS too!</div></div><hr />

I haven't killed Tarlna, Rukhmar, nor Supreme Lord Kazzak at all. Without dropping tier armor (a tradition dating back to WotLK's release in late 2008), world bosses are not worth the time nor effort for their mostly sub-par loot.<br />
<br />
Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tarlna and Drov being only 30% has very little to do with garrisons. They were both released at the same time as highmaul which has 655 gear on normal while the world bosses only dropped 650 gear. Being that Highmaul normal was pretty much puggable on day 1 there was little reason for anyone outside of the lfr community to kill them. Especially considering that they drop no interesting loot (no weapons, no trinkets, no mounts, no pets, no toys). Compare that with the MoP world bosses who all either had a mount, tier gear, or high ilvl gear (Ordos). I would think Rukhmar would be higher because there is a mount, but again the loot is lower ilvl than normal BRF and no interesting slots are dropped. Kazzak on the other hand drops gear that is on par with normal archimonde drops and is better than most other normal mode bosses in HFC. <br />
<br />
TL;DR: People don't kill world bosses when the drops are worse than that of normal difficulty.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ablib</div><div class="date">2015-10-31, 01:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tarina - No gear and no mount. Pointless. Good job, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Rukhmar - Mount! Shitty gear, plus overtuned. I haven't done Rukhmar in months, but the group wiped more than it killed. To this day, groups are still selective of who joins (as opposed to Kazzak, where it's just an auto-invite festival).<br />
<br />
Kazzak - Hey! Blizzard finally got it right! Decent gear PLUS a shitload of felblight making on average of probably 1800 gold every time you killed him. Plus decently hard ( I guess, I see a lot of people die on him), but never so bad that it's a wipe.<br />
<br />
Despite how Blizzard loves to remind us that the WoW devs are not new, and have been there for years -- the world boss shit we got in this expansion were nothing but rookie mistakes.</div></div><hr />

Rukhmar has a chance to drop a unique mount (lets pretend the stamina gemcutter doesn't exist), while Kazzak drops gear usable in HFC (except that shitty leech/speed/avoidance trinket), and felblight to generate extra gold<br />
<br />
The thing is according to those statistic even on kazzak there is a large % of people that havent killed him,yet people still compain about content.</div></div><hr />

This type of defense against the &quot;haters&quot; who complain about having &quot;nothing to do&quot; is just... *facepalm*.<br />
<br />
Just cause there is &quot;content&quot; to do, I must do it even if it doesn't interest me? I never did PvP in WOTLK but I had plenty to do, professions, rep farming with the tabard to get little upgrades and enchants, daily dungeons etc. etc., -THAT- is content, not some random crap somewhere in the world with no point of doing.</div></div><hr />
