Incoming Hotfixes<br />
We’re in the process of planning for a number of hotfixes that are intended to be implemented within the next day or two. To help give some heads up notice we’re currently looking to make the following changes:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Shadow Power (Shadow priest passive) is being changed from 25% to 15% of Shadow damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Moonfury (Balance druid passive) is being changed from 10% to 6% Arcane and Nature damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Raging Blow reduced from 120% to 100% weapon damage at max level.<br />
<br />
<br />
In all three cases we’ve been closely monitoring performance since the patch and all 3 specs are currently doing too much damage in PvE. In the case of Shadow and Fury we were also worried about their PvP burst potential, but didn’t want to risk affecting them in PvE. Now that we have concluded they are too high in PvE, both aspects of the game should feel more balanced.<br />
<br />
We are also looking at nerfing Aimed Shot, but compensating hunters through Aspect of the Hawk. We are also likely to lower Arcane mage mana cost in some way, which will in turn buff their dps. These don’t have those specifics just yet, but do keep an eye on the 4.0.6 hotfix blog for these and other changes as they come through.<br />
<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..deathknight) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1116-Death-Knight-Cataclysm))<br />
Recent DK changes<br />
Going from 4.0.3 to 4.0.6, our goal was to lower Unholy death knight damage and raise mobility. Our 4.0.6 changes didn’t quite hit the mark (we undershot on damage and overshot on mobility), so we had to make additional adjustments. The nerfs to Death Coil and pet damage in 4.0.6 were never intended to compensate for the addition of Death's Advance, but were completely separate and PvE motivated. We felt that Unholy damage was too high in most PvE encounters, and it was necessary to reduce their dps output as a result. The mastery buff compensated for the intended adjustments a bit too much, so it was necessary to tune down those abilities again. An additional bug fix was also applied to Death and Decay that should not affect damage and was not a part of these balance adjustments.<br />
<br />
Death's Advance was included to help address Unholy death knight mobility issues in PvP, but it turned out to be too effective, and so it was toned down. It should still help increase up-time on PvP targets though.<br />
<br />
While these changes were up on PTR, we tend to get limited testing - particularly when there isn't new raid content to test - and the PTR is often of limited value for PvP testing. While we appreciate the efforts of the players who participated and sent us feedback, it’s still a relatively small sample size compared to the millions of players who experience the changes when they actually go live. Deploying quick fixes, especially nerfs, isn’t always popular among players, but when they're possible, we think it’s a better course of action in the long run than letting balance problems persist. We’ll continue to monitor these and other class issues and periodically step in as necessary. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157847/proposed-dk-changes))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..paladin) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1670-Paladin-Cataclysm))<br />
Hammer of the Righteous bug fix<br />
This change to Hammer of the Righteous was a bug fix. Before the change, if the main attack missed the area attack also missed. If the main attack hit, the area attack could still miss.<br />
<br />
Now, if the main attack misses the area attack also misses, but if the main attack hits, the area attack also hits. This means there is only one hit/miss roll for the attack, as opposed to two before.<br />
<br />
We like that the design of this ability is different from other AoE attacks which have individual attack rolls. Hammer of the Righteous is a single attack with splash damage and we don't see a reason to change its design at this time. We just wanted to fix the consistency issue.(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/157864/hotr-in-todays-patch))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzards sure loves balancing this game around PvE! If their damage was fine in PvE, but too bursty in PvP, Blizzard wouldn't care because it's fine in PvE. Funny how blizzards only cares about PvE, and only makes PvP changes if it doesn't affect the PvE aspect of the game. Seriously, when are they gonna make it so certain abilities have different effects on PvE and PvP targets? They do it with CCs already, why not damage abilities?<br />
<br />
Now, if I'm not mistaken, I believe they said they'd do something like this about a year ago. Where the hell is it?</div></div><hr />

Did you see the part about nerfing Aimed Shot?<br />
<br />
That's where most of the Hunter DPS is coming from right now (over 30% of each of the Hunter's damage I'm looking at).<br />

15% was worth 100% prepatch it was approx 33% buffed. so putting it on 133% nerfing the 15 too 8% puts it back too 71%<br />
aka it's not even a buff anymore too how it was in 4.0.3 it's actually a nerf now. and with balance alreay bumped down from 2nd overall too 5th a nerf wasn't really needed if you ask me since RNG still plays a huge roll on moonkin dps. i wouldn't be suprissed if a nerf like this puts us below elemental shaman's</div></div><hr />

This doesn't make sense at all. MM still isn't higher than survival in dps (unless in near-all BiS) and this would be buffing Survival and Beast Mastery and only nerfing MM. Granted, bm needs a little something extra but do you really want to put survival back to what it was a week ago? xD <br />

If you do this you'll be nerfing the wrong thing and buffing an even wronger thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sometimes you wonder how hard it is to test the game on your own so you don't even need the PTR.<br />
<br />
&quot;OMG NEED A BIGGER SAMPLE&quot;. No... the only sample you need is of 30 relatively skilled people playing every different spec in all different facets of the game (I'm 100% sure Blizzard can find people that would be willing to get paid for this crap) to see if things are balanced.<br />
<br />
P.S. Good fixes are good. Something needs to be done about frost mages. How hard is it to see that they need a nerf in PvP? They nerf warriors, one of the least represented class in high end arenas, and ignore frost mages, one of the top 3?<br />

Its technically not mastery, mastery is Total Eclipse, moonfury is just a passive increase to nature/arcane damage, but still, mastery buff than moonfury nerf, dps wont change by much, maybe 1-2k max in BiS</div></div><hr />

MM is currently higher than Survival was prepatch (depending on the fight) almost soley due to the fact that aimed shot is hitting for around 23k and criting for around 45k.</div></div><hr />

First of all, not that many people even use the PTR, nor do they have any idea how to even judge how much DPS they're doing compared to before, ESPECIALLY in a raid setting.<br />
<br />
Anyone that just DLs the PTR client, logs in with a pre-made class that isn't theres, or logs in just to run around hitting a dummy for 5 mins, is to blame. The COMMUNITY is what the PTR is for, so blame yourselves when things aren't really tested.<br />
<br />

That said, surprised Ret paladins aren't getting a slight tune down. They went from bottom level DPS to the top, sort of like Shadow Priests and Balance Druids. Spose it's just a matter of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you had your head up your ass for the last month or so? The better people's gear got, the more hunters fell behind on DPS. SV was great at the very beginning, but that has always been a spec that scales exceedingly poorly. I'm glad they are nerfing AiS, tbh. Maybe it'll make arcane our worthwhile focus dump again and I'll be able to play like a proper hunter, instead of a caster. Take away our mana, but makes us play more like a caster than ever? Makes no sense.<br />

<br />
It's stupid to blame the community. We pay them to play their game. We do not pay them to test their products for them. If the PTR isn't working, hire a better god damn QA team and make sure it gets tested well in house. When any other game gets released with a lot of bugs it gets slammed by critics and gamers alike. Why should people expect less from Blizzard?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Through AotH? Hmm, what could it be... Aimed shot hard casting is the only thing keeping us viable on single target encounters, so hopefully there will be compensation or hunters will end up with 3 non-viable PvE specs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drbutcher</div><div class="date">2011-02-12, 02:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now they just have to buff Ele shammies, Enh shammies and kitty druids a bit and PvE damage starts to look somewhat balanced.<br />
<br />
Exactly this.If they give those 2 specs around 1000dps together with the nurfs to other hybrids then we will have a balance .Whoever says different they never checked worldoflogs and they believe that because they are last as SP or Boomkin in their guild they are bad.<br />
<br />
But again i really can't understand why they have test realms.What's the reason for it? Can't they see this happening before it comes live?Everyone was saying that SPs PVE dps was TOOOOOOOO high before it came live.Everyone was saying that shamans dps is lower than other hybrids.Why they had to wait till live? What's the reason of having test realms?<br />
<br />
After they manage to balance single target dps then they should take a look at aoe/cleave as well.Like it or now in every tier around 40% of the bosses have adds that must be cleaved or aoe.You can't have specs that do the same aoe damage as single target and others doing 3-4 times more.</div></div><hr />

That's not how percent decreases work, nor is it how the passive interacts with other damage decreases.<br />
<br />
Suffice it to say it is less than a 3k nerf off of the very top 30k+ Shadow priests.<br />
<br />
For level geared priests, it's probably more like 1-2k tops.</div></div><hr />

15% was worth 100% prepatch it was approx 33% buffed. so putting it on 133% nerfing the 15 too 8% puts it back too 71%<br />
aka it's not even a buff anymore too how it was in 4.0.3 it's actually a nerf now. and with balance alreay bumped down from 2nd overall too 5th a nerf wasn't really needed if you ask me since RNG still plays a huge roll on moonkin dps. i wouldn't be suprissed if a nerf like this puts us below elemental shaman's<br />
<br />
The comment is misleading: Moonfury was reduced from 15% to (now) 6%. You can find 6% in official blizzard forums. It actually has nothing to do with mastery, it is a straight 9% to all arcane/nature dmg. It is a 9% dps NERF to boomkins. I'm not normally one to post or be one of those random whingers on forums about slight nerfs/buffs etc, but this one really was nigh on ridiculous. True, boomkins were dominating double-dotting fights and that involves a lot of the current tier, and that probably needed a nerf of SOME sort, perhaps slightly lower dot dmg compensated with slightly higher starsurge dmg to compensate. I realise that blizzard worked hard to get away from movement gimping boomkin dps so hard with cata and my suggestion above would be a bit of a step backward from that but it's more reasonable than a straight 9% dmg nerf across the board. <br />
<br />
In my humble opinion this will destroy boomkin single target dps, and put us mid-pack for double dotting fights if we're really, really good. <br />
<br />
Through all of this, for those few boomkin pvp'ers out there, pvp will be virtually destroyed as well. <br />
<br />
I think it was a hasty, ill-thought &quot;oh shit boomkins are too high on certain encounters with the change to mastery, quick nerf em before pure dps'ers whine about it&quot; change.<br />
<br />
And yes, things like this sometimes do make us wonder what PTR patches are for. <br />
<br />
My 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

Buffing hawk is a great idea, since it can boost SV's dps that is actually very low atm and BM as well.</div></div><hr />

this pretty much sums up my feelings. To the poster who asked what would it be like without a PTR, who knows but it would seem like it wouldnt be much different.<br />
<br />
Well im sure the people who spent gold to respec to MM and reforge ( if necessary, since i never even looked at it) are out ofopocket. They will nerf aimed and buff hawk, so SV will once again be king since hawk will probably rebuff SV almost back to what it was<br />

Blizzards sure loves balancing this game around PvE! If their damage was fine in PvE, but too bursty in PvP, Blizzard wouldn't care because it's fine in PvE. Funny how blizzards only cares about PvE, and only makes PvP changes if it doesn't affect the PvE aspect of the game. Seriously, when are they gonna make it so certain abilities have different effects on PvE and PvP targets? They do it with CCs already, why not damage abilities?<br />

Well, not really. PVP hasn't excisted on this serious level for six year, neither has the large community sites, the hardcore world first races etc.<br />
People are way more sensitive about class changes / nerfs then they have been earlier, and therefore theres a bigger reaction to all this fail balancing. You know somethings getting out of hand when they can't control they're own spell/ability.</div></div><hr />

Your opinion on Paladin DPS being bad by you having -- quoting you here on this -- not touched your paladin in months is invalid by virtue that you are not playing your paladin to see this information firsthand. <br />

<br />
Your opinion on Paladin DPS being bad by you having -- quoting you here on this -- not touched your paladin in months is invalid by virtue that you are not playing your paladin to see this information firsthand. <br />
<br />
Referencing a buggy parser website that averages out the last 2 weeks of data only 3 days after a substantial patch as having even nearly enough data to even make a remotely informed opinion on the 'state of DPS' for Ret paladins is just outright stupid.<br />
<br />
Please. Please stop being the reason why so many people hate ret paladins.<br />
<br />
stateofdps.com Has updated for your information. It's currently showing shadow priest at the top (Which is true) and balance druids right under them, So yes the site is updating frequently or else it would have never have shown that huge jump in dps that shadow and feral's recieved. So yes ret paladins are still at the &quot;Bottom&quot; Whether you like it or not.</div></div><hr />

lowering arcane mage mana, which will buff it's dps... yes, yes it will ...<br />
<br />
http://www.simulationcraft.org/Raid_T11_372_406.html<br />
alrdy shows arcane up there<br />
<br />
but it has no aoe, or dmg on the move worth speaking off.<br />
blatantly boring, and as it seems, the soon to be only spec available for competitive play.<br />
and i seriously hate it with a passion D:<br />
look at the other mage specs dammit blizz :s there's a damn 5k dps gap with those uptop, and in general a 3k'ish at least.<br />
<br />
you mean...<br />
<br />
http://stateofdps.com/<br />
<br />
arcane is at the bottom of every boss fight :P<br />
<br />
<br />
fire is where mage dps should be, with extremes being the mass AE fights like Halfus and Maloriak. every other fight, fire is great dps. frost and arcane could use a boost, with arcane using a huge boost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;OMG NEED A BIGGER SAMPLE&quot;. No... the only sample you need is of 30 relatively skilled people playing every different spec in all different facets of the game (I'm 100% sure Blizzard can find people that would be willing to get paid for this crap) to see if things are balanced.<br />
<br />
P.S. Good fixes are good. Something needs to be done about frost mages. How hard is it to see that they need a nerf in PvP? They nerf warriors, one of the least represented class in high end arenas, and ignore frost mages, one of the top 3?<br />
<br />
Sigh... guess I'll just continue playing just cause I'm addicted.<br />
<br />
Actually you do need a far larger sample to test things like this because small scale internal testing only finds superficial or glaringly obvious bugs. No two people play exactly the same, have the same set up, the same addons or the same approach to things, and you need to try and test every possible scenario, event, trigger and play mechanic comprehensively, this doesn't happen within a small group. You can try, but with just 30 people, even with 300 people, you will not catch everything. Things slip through the cracks. It's one of the rules of good programming. Comprehensive, large scale testing to provide a robust program, that won't crash and die the moment something outside it's parameters occurs.</div></div><hr />

They boosted Mind sear by 15% with the patch, but even with that our aoe is still low compared to many class (hunter and warlock for example). With this hotfix, Mind sear will only do 5% more damage then before the patch, and I really don't think we need a nerf over our already poor aoe (it cost too much mana too).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tested Unholy on the PTR and it seemed to be fine to me. I was doing about 16k on a dummy. Apparently melee classes shouldn't be allowed to pull 30k DPS in heroic raid gear, yet it's acceptable for a hunter to do 20k single target on a raid boss in normal raid gear. This patch clearly shows that Blizzard doesn't test at all themselves and doesn't get people to test because the realms seemed pretty freaking empty compared to other times I have tested.<br />
<br />
<br />
why the pve dk hate?<br />
<br />
we already got cheated out of good pve skills for lvl 81-85<br />
<br />
No kidding. They really screwed DK's in Cataclysm with core abilities. Outbreak is meh, I'd make the argument that it's extremely good if it had a 30 second CD, good for not wasting runes I guess but Necrotic Strike and Dark Simulacrum are pretty useless in PvE. I really wonder how much the developers at Blizzard snort coke when they make some of the insane changes they have done recently. They just keep breaking the game, making players frustrated with their characters because they go from either being a good spec to being a terrible one like 3.1 Ret Paladin or Unholy DK's now. I went from doing around 18k DPS in a 25 man to 14k DPS in a 10 man with pretty much all the same buffs.</div></div><hr />

Apparently Death Coil hitting for 14k post patch is too much, mine hits for 7k on average now at 354 ilvl. And yeah, having to change my entire gearing setup to get more mastery really pissed me off so much, it's hurting my DPS big time right now.

It's amazing how some classes become OP from a patch and are left that way until the next f****** big patch or even longer than that. But as soon as spriests become a bit OP, they quickly nerf us back into submission. Just goes to show you how much Blizzard hates priests and never ever wants us to be on the top in ANYTHING.<br />

...no? This isn't some high school stats problem, it's a game that serves over 10 million people with hundreds of different abilities and can affect each other in ways that you sometimes just can't predict in such a fast-paced and changing environment. If Blizzard could merely pay 30 people to do what you say instead of investing vast amounts of time and money into PTR patches and servers, don't you think they would? And what defines &quot;skilled&quot; anyway? And would a skilled player necessarily find some quirky bug or imbalance that a &quot;non-skilled&quot; player might with his different spec or rotations? Can 30 people really cover every, single possibility and aspect of a class?<br />

Unshackeled fury (fury mastery doh), increases the damage of all abilities that cause us to be or &quot;require&quot; us to be enraged, thus affecting raging blow so the tooltip is on point.

This doesn't make sense at all. MM still isn't higher than survival in dps (unless in near-all BiS) and this would be buffing Survival and Beast Mastery and only nerfing MM. Granted, bm needs a little something extra but do you really want to put survival back to what it was a week ago? xD <br />
<br />
If you do this you'll be nerfing the wrong thing and buffing an even wronger thing.MM is now by far the highest dps spec in any level of gear and SV actually comes in last on single targets.

You have to wonder what hunter would agree with these changes. :confused: The buff to Aspect of the Hawk? You mean the one they nerfed before? What do you mean &quot;by far&quot;? Seem a couple feet would be far using your example. Any gear? Come on! Use the same gear and the results are the same. MM reduced to already nerfed SV levels. That's just great!<br />
<br />
Why have a PTS when changes seem reactionary and based on QQ on forums. How hard is it to test actual DPS numbers? Isn't it a matter of math and formulas? Hell, I'm not a programmer, but even I can see many of these changes were not studied, tested or verified. <br />
<br />
It sometimes seems like Blizzard employees come back from a week of skiing, read a few forums and implement changes. I'd love a job where my customers tell me how to improve my product. Take Note Blizzard: Hire a few mathematicians to calculate your number and you might see how things can be balanced. <br />
<br />
Humorous note: Have you ever seen the skit where two brother share a chocolate bar? The big brother breaks the bar almost in half, but one piece is bigger than the other. He takes a large bite out of the larger piece. Now the pieces are still not the same size. So he takes another large bite. He continues taking large bites out of the pieces of chocolate until they are almost gone. He hands the remaining tiny piece to his little brother. That is how Blizzard approaches balancing classes. :cool:</div></div><hr />

The results are nowhere near that. If a Hunter can hard-cast Aimed , replacing Arcane completely, he can do 3-4k more dps than he can by just using the normal MM rotation using Aimed only on proc. This is also 3-4k more than the other 2 specs can do. Nerf Aimed by 25% and make it only advantageous to be used on proc, forget about buffing Hawk, and you get 3 specs that are within 4% of each other and that's how it should be. How Hunters then compare to other classes is of less importance.</div></div><hr />
