&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/dps.png&quot; title=&quot;Dps&quot; /&gt; Damage Dealers - Stand in Ursoc's path when he uses &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/198006-focused-gaze&quot;&gt;Focused Gaze&lt;/a&gt; to reduce the amount of damage &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/198109-barreling-impact&quot;&gt;Barreling Impact&lt;/a&gt; inflicts.<br />
Avoid &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/198099-barreling-momentum&quot;&gt;Barreling Momentum&lt;/a&gt; when afflicted with &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/198108-unbalanced&quot;&gt;Unbalanced&lt;/a&gt;.<br />

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Tanks - Ensure that no tank overlaps the effects of both &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/197943-overwhelm&quot;&gt;Overwhelm&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/197942-rend-flesh&quot;&gt;Rend Flesh&lt;/a&gt; at the same time, taunting when necessary.<br />
Stay out of the proximity of Nightmare Images to avoid &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/197980-nightmarish-cacophony&quot;&gt;Nightmarish Cacophany&lt;/a&gt;.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Overwhelm (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/197943) - Ursoc overwhelms a player's defenses, inflicting 1,680,000 Physical damage. This reduces armor by 20% and increases damage taken by &lt;span style=&quot;color: White&quot;&gt;Rend Flesh&lt;/span&gt; by 100% for 12 sec. This effect stacks.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/tank.png&quot; title=&quot;Tank&quot; /&gt; Rend Flesh (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/197942) - Ursoc viciously rends a player, inflicting 1,350,000 Physical damage and an additional 790,000 Physical damage every 2 sec for 12 sec. <br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Focused Gaze (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198006) - Ursoc focuses his gaze upon a player, charging them after 6 sec and striking them with &lt;span style=&quot;color: White&quot;&gt;Crushing Impact&lt;/span&gt;.

<br />
Barreling Momentum (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198099) - Ursoc charges through any players to his target, inflicting 435,000 Physical damage to all targets in his path and knocking them back.<br />
<br />
Unbalanced (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198108) - Players in Ursoc's path struck by &lt;span style=&quot;color: White&quot;&gt;Barreling Momentum&lt;/span&gt;, suffer 500% increased damage from &lt;span style=&quot;color: White&quot;&gt;Barreling Momentum&lt;/span&gt; for 50 sec.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/march/important.png&quot; title=&quot;Important&quot; /&gt; Barreling Impact (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198109) - When Ursoc reaches his marked target, he inflicts 1,290,000 Physical damage to all players. This effect is reduced by each player Ursoc has charged through.<br />

<br />
Roaring Cacophony (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/197969) - Releases a mighty roar, inflicting 3,670,000 Physical damage divided evenly among all players within 20 yds.<br />
<br />
Nightmarish Cacophony (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/197980) - Whenever Ursoc roars, he leaves behind a Nightmare Image. On subsequent Ursoc roars, the Nightmare Image also releases a mighty roar, inflicting 500,000 Shadow damage divided evenly among all players within 20 yds. This effect causes players to run in fear for 6 sec.<br />
Miasma (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205611) - Nightmare Images project a zone of miasma 20 yds around themselves, inflicting 120,000 Shadow damage every 1 sec to players caught within.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
One of the tweets notes the change (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133767-lucent-stormforge-ring#20810-20914) to remove Strength, Agility, and Int from the few Legion necks, rings, and cloaks that have been added so far.<br />
Classes<br />

With all the mobility in Legion for other casses some additional gap closer for DKs would be great. <br />
Not every class should be highly mobile. That being said, check out the &quot;Death's Flight (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/208277-deaths-flight)&quot; talent for Unholy! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688107350369042433))<br />

Can you clarify if Prot Paladins still hit 5 targets with Avenger's Shield in Legion?<br />
Avenger's Shield will hit 3 targets baseline, but there may be ways to increase that number. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688108659063193601))<br />

Its currently better to not cast lava burst at all on alpha, lightning bolt trumps it in every way.<br />
This isn't something we are seeing, and it is certainly not intended. Can you share any details? (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688108788608417792))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
On the alpha, why do rings and necks not have int, strength, or agility on them?<br />
We’re experimenting with different designs for how rings, necklaces, and cloaks are itemized. Hang tight for details! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688106098746769408))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Will there be any customization with stats in PvP left? (e.g. able to spend some of the template on a certain stat)<br />
What type of customization did you do in the past that you liked? Picking a secondary stat to stack? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/688119391494393856))<br />
<br />
Will the new Pvp system in legion be introduce to all levels in the pvp range (starting at level 10)<br />
There will be a chance to win items at the completion of a battleground; similar to dungeons while leveling. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/688134340568432640))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
how important would you say math is to game design? or is it all done by computers now?<br />
Math is very important to systems design. Most designers I work with are reasonably skilled at math, and some are experts. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687365750256877568))<br />
If you are building levels, narrative or maybe UI, math is less essential. Anything that involves combat is inherently numbers. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687365974064893952))<br />
I'd add that you're gonna need good, solid, time-tested vector math if you want anything moving on screen.<br />
It depends how your studio divides design work and engineering work. Math is part of almost all engineering. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687373680867848192))<br />
If you're making UI and you want stuff moving around and feeling interactive, math looms ahead!<br />
That may be. I designed a lot of UI for AoE and WoW and never used a calculator. I did for classes and items. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/687373528019013632))<br />

<br />
Rather annoying there's nothing on LFR yet. Only reaffirms my fears it'll be keeping to the WoD model. What are the LFR sets going to look like this time? Recolors of the quest rewards we got while leveling up ... if they're recolored at all? And then set bonuses so boring they're in line with the stat stick trinkets? Ugh.<br />
<br />
Also still find it curious why the shamans get 4 versions of their tier while everyone else gets 2. Very curious.</div></div><hr />

I disagree, the skull on the Wrathful set are actually old drake (Sapphiron) model skulls.<br />

These do look like rams though. Shoulders aside, the set looks nothing like Wrathful IMO</div></div><hr />

But this is WoW, the game where shoulders are just about 85% of a set...<br />

The entire point you missed is that we looks like lich king xx time :-). As i said its just recycled design that we used to wear xx times.... you missed my point :-) peace<br />

Agreed. One of them (Mythic) looks like the Lich King, another (Ally conq) looks like the Lich King's spare outfit, and the rest of them look like the reason the Lich King needs a spare outfit. Apparently he falls into random vats of ketchup and guacamole. Which, I guess, is what happens when you try to make a &quot;Player 2&quot; color scheme for such an iconic design. Along with the feeling of being an also-ran, something I'm sure the other 98% of players &quot;appreciate.&quot; How come the HotS team can come up with three different Arthas color schemes that don't look like condiment accidents, but the WoW team cannot?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magnosh</div><div class="date">2016-01-19, 10:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 2 versions of the same set in this video if you keep an eye on the shoulders, I wonder which one will make it, if those tiny little details are what differentiate mythic from heroic it is disappointing. I do think the set looks ok, I'm not a particular fan of it, its like a lame version of the Lich King set and this is why:<br />
- Helm looks pathetic, it looks awfully similar to the WoD Blacksmith set with tiny minor tweeks and now looking like an owl, that is not fit for the Hand of the Lich King on all seriousness. I honestly don't like the Blacksmith helm from WoD to make it to the Legion official DK set. But then again by looking at Blizzard's idea for helms for DKs I shouldn't be that surprised (seeing Tier18 mythic and hc). They lost the touch after doing MoP Challenge Modes.<br />
- Shoulders look decent but a bit off specially on the Human model, but I also like shoulders a bit more different, for instance having different ones on each shoulder (e.g. Lich King set, Warrior CM set, dk tier 10)<br />
- Color schemes, why do we have that rusty cooper/goldish? We are no palas nor warriors. Those bits of wool all over the armor look terrible with that brownish/orangish color, we are not scarecrows either. Generally speaking of the colors they look too shiny too different too rainbowish, was expecting more darkish more pure black/very dark grey.<br />
<br />
But, the belt looks great!</div></div><hr />

And the palette isn't helping either.</div></div><hr />

The exact same way the HotS team can come up with an AMAZINGLY EPIC Avatar animation while warriors look like they felt on a chocolate fountain when they use Avatar. :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensa</div><div class="date">2016-01-20, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you all know the real problem with all these tier sets (and armour in WoW in general) is, right?<br />
<br />
The real problem is that we're so heavily armoured that you could roll a few bowling balls down a battlefield and wipe out an entire enemy force incapable of getting out of the way and/or standing back up.<br />
<br />
I know this is fantasy and all but the complete lack of any reasonable relationship between the agility our characters portray and the armour they wear actually makes the suspension of disbelief that much harder and the whole experience less immersive if you give it even a second of thought.<br />
<br />
Personally, I always preferred the non tier pieces that appear made of more natural materials (cloth gloves that look like cloth etc) that are less cumbersome and have exposed portions (arms, legs and/or joints like the elbow) as well as headgear that exposes at least part of the face. They are at least somewhat consistent with the nature and method of combat of the character.</div></div><hr />

they should be completely different models, not recolorings.</div></div><hr />

Use the mog gear from the dwarven bunker, couple of sets have barely any coverage.</div></div><hr />
