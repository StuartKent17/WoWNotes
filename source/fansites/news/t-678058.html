&quot;We need to burn this boss now, pally healer X, DI dpser Y and after that shaman pop heroism.&quot;<br />
<br />
Can be happening atleast if there's a fight where at some early phase you need lots of healing with later there being a burn phase without as much healing required so you can ditch healers for chaining heroisms.<br />

People only play it for necessity - emblems. <br />
its the dungeon itself thats flawed, its rly boring.<br />

the vehicle aspect was fun to a degree, and of course they had to make a different dungeon to try something different. And i respect that, cheers for trying new stuff.<br />
<br />
But in the long run - the dungeon is just boring.<br />
<br />
Most dungeons you can make your own fun with massive chain pulling. So while the dungeon is still old as hell, and youve cleared it 50+ times - you can still be challenged when theres 30+ mobs beating on your tank :D<br />
<br />
you can do this in oculus as well, however the vehicle aspect just breaks the pace.<br />
If theres still people around that cant complete oculus, then i agree with the &quot;nerf&quot; - but if they are truly having issues, then this nerf wont help them any bit.</div></div><hr />

The Oculus change was needed not because of its difficulty but because so many people hate that dungeon that it would really break the flow of the new system to get Oculus as your random daily and then have 3-4 people bail from your group.</div></div><hr />

I am pissed off at it too, may as well not implement the change, it will be as they said. A Pally is a 3 phase boss, and LoH resets it.</div></div><hr />

I love how you act like you're speaking for the community.<br />
<br />
The dungeon isn't flawed because it's boring, it's flawed because people can't figure out how to attack shit on dragons, adding a up and down control to fighting fucks people up that much apparently.<br />
<br />
If you talk to most people about occulus [or spend 1 minute of your life reading comments about the instance] you'll find that people don't like it because it's frustrating, not because it's boring. I actually think Occulus is far less boring than most of the other 5man's in WotLK.<br />
<br />
And yes, once 3.3 hits Occulus will get run a lot more often. A lot of people still need it for teh achievement and a lot of people will be knocking out every heroic possible everyday to rack up as many triumph and conquest badges as possible.</div></div><hr />

Definitely happening atleast if there's a fight where at some early phase you need lots of healing with later there being a burn phase without as much healing required so you can ditch healers for chaining heroisms.<br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt this would ever happen. For one the bonus of giving one person heroism in 25 man isn't going to be game breaking, and then for any of the tough fights out there in ICC I'll say for sure you're not going to let one of your pallies kill themself and then risk a tank death or force a brez and rebuff the pally. Even in 10 mans I'd seriously doubt you'd sack your tank healer, and even then, you'd need 2 shamans in group to &quot;double&quot; heroism.<br />
<br />
I doubt you could ever see this used like you described, unless some caster really wanted to stack their rank on wmo on some easy fight. No doubt someone will try...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omedon</div><div class="date">2009-11-10, 12:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The deal with Occulus and its relation to a &quot;PUG crazy world&quot; post 3.3, IMHO is this:<br />
<br />
At level 80, you know that, ideally, the people in your group have had 80 levels (or 55 with one class, then 25 with a deathknight) to learn their class. They have little excuse to not have LRND2*insertclassabreviationhere*<br />
<br />
A fresh 80 (which you CAN GET with the new LFG) hasn't necessarilly LRND2DRAGON. It's not even wholly reasonable, with the current attitude toward occulus, to expect many experienced players to magically know how to &quot;dragon&quot; in time for the 3.3 randomness.<br />
<br />
When you think of occulus, you do not think intuitive. Not by a long shot. Clearly blizzard realizes that &quot;unintuitive + PUG rush = bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
People getting ready to do Ulduar with their guild know what they are getting into, they know &quot;hey guess what, you're about to go from X class to Y vehicle, let's learn that stuff together!&quot; and away you go. Someone clicking &quot;random PUGness&quot; and praying they don't get &quot;that instance that they heard has vehicles that I'll just quit when I get it&quot; is counter to what blizz wants out of this new engine.<br />
<br />
Elite it up all you want, everyone is new once. With Occulus, you are new twice. That's the problem with the Occulus. Not everyone wants to be &quot;new at their class&quot; again at 80, so they dodge it. I can't really blame em, learning a &quot;second class&quot; for one instance that you likely skipped till now hardly seems time efficient to me.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...and then proceeds to speak for the community. Sigh.<br />
<br />
I, on the other hand, can only speak from personal experience. Wiping on a heroic is near impossible a group all equipped in 245 ilevel equipment, except in Oculus. There's just a lot of little things that can go wrong in there, and it just isn't worth it for two triumph badges. And to me, it's just a novelty instance, much like Eye of Eternity. It's really cool the first couple of times, but then every time after, I wish I could just get off the damn dragon and complete the instance already. Novelty fights like that are best left for one-time quest chains. Any more than that, and it's...well, boring. That's right, BORING.<br />
<br />
But hey, that's just me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oculus isn't boring and it's easy unless you get total retards in your pugs (it can happen), but it's a horrible design. I really doubt that all these nerfs are going to change the public view on the instance. Just because it's even more faceroll now doesn't mean it has stopped sucking. Even with these nerfs, I would gladly take any other instance (minus Stratholme which bores you to death with its slow, triggered events) over Oculus any day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xentropy</div><div class="date">2009-11-10, 12:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oculus had been my second-favorite heroic since the start of Wrath. HoL was first. I liked having some r-tard checks, see what people can't learn a 3-button &quot;second class&quot; in under 5 minutes. See what people can't figure out positioning when the need to be close or far changes rather than stays constant. It was amazing seeing just how many people failed at Loken and Eregos.<br />
<br />
Nowdays there really aren't fun 5-mans left. Oculus was already nerfed once; as soon as they added drake scaling months ago the instance became a joke. This second round of nerfs boggles my mind. And I can't remember the last time I had a group on Loken not just outgear it and stand in for every nova and let the healer get everyone topped back off almost instantly. I miss being appropriately geared and NEEDING to run out then as quickly as possible back in to avoid big ticks of aura. It was great.<br />
<br />
Anyone who hated Oculus because they didn't want to &quot;learn a second class&quot; isn't good at this game; they're good at being good little monkeys, looking up specs and rotations and copycating them. Kudos to anyone that went into Oculus early in Wrath and tore Eregos a new one by spending 2 minutes to use their own personal brains and figuring out how to put the three-piece puzzle together for their drake. Extra kudos if you did it with all three drakes early. *Before* a strat site told you what order in which to press your three buttons.<br />
<br />
I hope there are more non-scaling vehicle-based encounters in the future to continue to tell the free thinkers from the monkeys.</div></div><hr />

For one the bonus of giving one person heroism in 25 man isn't going to be game breaking, and then for any of the tough fights out there in ICC I'll say for sure you're not going to let one of your pallies kill themself and then risk a tank death or force a brez and rebuff the pally. Even in 10 mans I'd seriously doubt you'd sack your tank healer, and even then, you'd need 2 shamans in group to &quot;double&quot; heroism.<br />
<br />
I doubt you could ever see this used like you described, unless some caster really wanted to stack their rank on wmo on some easy fight. No doubt someone will try...<br />
<br />
<br />
It's very, very unlikely and I don't think it's a balancing problem, but if there is a hard fight where in say p3 you need to finish the boss and healing requirement drops from 6 to 3, you might aswell sack 3 holy paladins if you had them. Don't think there's going to be a fight like this though. Just wanted to bring up this one possible use of the mechanic.</div></div><hr />

most people know that you can buff the dragons once people are mounted, but you can *also* buff your own dragon, if you quickly target it when it's flying to you to land and hit the hotkey for your buff.<br />
My priest loves it ;)<br />
<br />
(motw+bok give almost inconsequent buff to the dragons, only about 3% each, but priest's improved fort gives a big health buff)</div></div><hr />

If by this you mean that everyone complains about vehicle fights but they still remain the most pugged and easiest encounters in the game? There is a reason there are around 20 pugs that just do FL on every server. Vehicle fights are not that difficult.</div></div><hr />

With Occulus, you are new twice. That's the problem with the Occulus. Not everyone wants to be &quot;new at their class&quot; again at 80, so they dodge it. I can't really blame em, learning a &quot;second class&quot; for one instance that you likely skipped till now hardly seems time efficient to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, when I hit 80 I went on a whirlwind tour with my guild and cleared every single heroic in one night. Occulus took a little longer to learn, but it was still able to be learned on the night I hit 80. If someone fails so badly that they can't learn the drakes I'm not sure I want to be the one that is forced to group with them. If you need 80 levels to learn to press button ABABABAB and move in a circle then you really should consider rather you need to play video games at all. I'm not an elitist by any stretch, but at a certain point either you suck to badly to play or you don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you are living proof that TOC was a joke. Seriously, if you can clear raiding instances you should be able to do Occulus. If you can't then you must just not be able to think without having someone tell you what to do (which is why you raid).</div></div><hr />

I've explained the drakes to people before. Its really not that hard. Then I have someone with experience grab a ruby and I grab an emerald because after the changes to allow drakes to scale with gear you can duo the final boss with a ruby and emerald that have a clue what they are doing. Of course, the newer people often do die unless they are really good at adapting. I've done the boss from 75% health with just one ruby and one emerald though, so its really not that hard.</div></div><hr />

No offense, but unless you class is paladin you are a crappy healer if you can't heal through the lasers on that boss. The whole place is set up to be a healer nightmare but any decent group healer can easily heal through the mistakes that most people make. Only times I've ever had issues is when people ran away from me. I'd rather they just stand there and take the damage.</div></div><hr />

They already nerfed oculus to a ridiculously easy level. People are just scared to go because it used to be hard, atm.<br />

I lol'd at the last bit. If you choose to let people die you ARE a crappy healer :p<br />
But generally the rest of it doesn't seem too wrong. It isn't hard. People are just scared.<br />
<br />
I'll bet people will still be scared of this shit. Maybe blizz should just post that they are nerfing and leave it as is. That would give the same effect.<br />
<br />

Although.. all this said, I don't know how the nerfed heroic will compare to other heroics. Hmm.<br />

You got it wrong. As a healer, my role is to heal unavoidable aoe damage, as well as keeping tank alive and occasionally, fix some mistakes people make. While I can easily keep everyone alive, I simply refuse to do so because their slacking attitude is pissing me off. If they have enough health to survive it, good for them. If they don't, they better learn to use strafe key.<br />
<br />
The whole point of this is not to piss other players off. It's to make an instance even a bit more fun. Or do people really find it fun to stand in one position and spam their dps rotation until they can collect their emblems? If you do find that fun, I seriously suggest you to consider why you play this game.<br />
<br />
I disagree on your statement about healer nightmare. Only places that can possibly be hard to heal in Ocu if you're crappy geared healer are 1) 2nd boss if people are not moving out of the aoe, 2) trash packs with mages and constructs if mages are not correctly cc:d AND people dwell in aoe, 3) trash packs with spectral mobs if tank slacks at aoe threat/dps are overaggroing or 4) 3rd boss if people don't move correctly. I've bolded you the IF parts where I clearly state that this is not a hard instance to heal if people are doing what they're supposed to do. Although, more often than not, people just tend to stand in fire and make it a healer nightmare.</div></div><hr />

Oculus nerfs were there so that people will actualy pug it now i guess. Since its stupidly easy, untill you bring the crayon eaters who cant seem to avoid the slow moving glowly death orbs it gets harder.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think Blizzard can make it any easier for those people. Occulus isn't that hard, but what gets people is the dragon 2-3 abilities they've never used before COMPLETELY AND UTTERLY throws them off. How hard is it to glance at the tooltip and go &quot;oh this is my shadowbolt-a-like.&quot; Oh excuse me they want to &quot;play their character they've invested in.&quot; Yeah. Right...<br />
<br />
But anyway, I'm sure if it was easy or not, Blizzard REALLY wants to get the LFG tool used and not be a failure like the last tool. And if it means making sure people aren't constantly bailing on Occulus runs, then so be it.<br />

Oculus<br />
Many bosses and creatures have had their total health reduced.<br />
Several bosses and creatures have had cooldowns on specific abilities increased, effect durations reduced, and damage on some of these abilities reduced.<br />
Ring-Lord Conjurers and Sorceresses now hang out in packs of 4 instead of packs of 5.<br />
Vehicle scaling on the drakes based on the rider&#8217;s item level has been increased to make them more powerful.<br />

How many times have you had to wipe on Malygos because 5 people didn't know if they should go right after someone yells out &quot;GO RIGHT&quot;?<br />
<br />
Vehicles is just a foreign concept to some of these people. If there was a list of instances i would never go pug with, Oculus would be the number one instance, no contest, I'd rather do all of Halls of Lightning with heroic geared people than spend a minute fighting Eregos with a pug.<br />
<br />
With the PuG system arriving soon, changes like these have to be made.</div></div><hr />

Nobody gives two !@#$s about the Oculus. It was a crappy instance that people ran once for the novelty and never ran again unless they had to. Now it's nerfed and people are in an uproar?<br />
<br />
Why? Nobody cared about it before, what makes it so special now that's it's nerfed?<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;ZOMG! They nerfed an instance that nobody does anyway! The game is ruined! DAMN YOU, BLIZZ!&quot;<br />
<br />
Get some goddamn perspective. They took a !@#$ instance and made it so that when it comes up on the random dungeon you can plow through it, get your tokens, and get the hell out of there.<br />

People are not skipping Oculus because it's hard, they're skipping it because it's boring and they hate mounted combat. Since Blizzard can't very well remove mounted combat from Oculus, they just nerfed it in the hopes that a few more people will run it now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One person under heroism, yeah hardly a difference, I agree. What about stacking paladins, druids and/or warlock, have all the paladins DI a DPSer and immediately battle-rez (so hardly a loss in healing) ?<br />

Yay for class-stacking (bring the player not the class, right ?)<br />

<br />
Occulus 20 minutes was the most difficult part for me, my guild hated me for asking for it every couple of days. <br />
Compared to the other achievements I found that one way harder than any other. You needed a perfect run to do it, that means:<br />
- no disconnect from MT or heal during a pull<br />
- no stupid aggro from a drake during the platforms trash or the second boss<br />
- no stupid whelp going evade on your way to Eregos<br />
- no silly wipe due to unnoticed healer aggro (noob mistake or lag, but don't tell me this *never* happens)<br />
- no one falling of his drake by not paying attention to its health<br />
- no user interface bug of the green drake during the final boss<br />
- no bad dps in your group, you need to convince your guild to take their mains or be lucky at the pickup lottery.<br />
<br />
And no, I don't think the nerf is justified. The hard heroic 5-man achievements were by far the most fun thing I did in Wotlk (respect your elders and watch him die were really cool).<br />
I'm just trying to understand the decision.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oculus is hard for new guys and if blizz nerfed it there is a good reason. you know the funny thing about eletists? they'd rather make a game content rot away, not use it, than allow some casuals to have fun experiencing it. luckily none of these are blizz employees or I'm afraid they'd last about a week before they get fired for utter stupidity.</div></div><hr />

I avoid occ like the plague.. well I don't really avoid the plague otherwise i would have stayed out of Northrend, but you know what I mean...

Way harder ? no, it just seems to me that you are adding unnecessary difficulty - see next comments)<br />
You needed a perfect run to do it, assuming we're talking about players at the level of skill+gear heroics are intended for (no overgearing by miles), yes, i agree, but that's the challenge and the interest, everyone needs challenges) that means:<br />
- no disconnect from MT or heal during a pull - okay, luck-based, but unless your tank has chronical disconnect, not a big deal (try changing your tank otherwise) and definitely not a developer/designer's side problem. There are tons of other disconnect-friendly content in this game.<br />
- no stupid aggro from a drake during the platforms trash or the second boss. Part of the challenge, deal with it. If necessary, run the normal instance studying a good path and have your group train at it.<br />
- no stupid whelp going evade on your way to Eregos. Not a problem, doesn't prevent you from killing him in the timer. Plus you just have to run out of range and they will either move away from obstacles or de-aggro.<br />
- no silly wipe due to unnoticed healer aggro (noob mistake or lag, but don't tell me this *never* happens) Well, it indeed never happens, and if I were you, I would change your tank. Healer aggro =&gt; tank threat problem / Unnoticed = Tank awareness problem. There are no packs big enough in this instance that any tank can't handle over healer's threat. If DPSers are adding to the difficulty, take your elitist voice and tell them to learn to team-play and let the tank grab multitarget aggro before going trigger-happy.<br />
- no one falling of his drake by not paying attention to its health Ok, where do I start ? &quot;Not paying attention to its health&quot; is basic skill, if your teammates can't handle that, well, maybe Occulus is over their skillcap. Not being an elitist here, just honest. Then, If your drakes are taking that much damages on the way, you should either a) study a better path to aggro less, b) use more of your abilities (amber time stop, red avoidance thing, green leech-dot) ... or both for that matters. And lats resort, if you see your drake will die anyway, just fly over something in order to not die from falling. If your drakes are dying on Eregos, get someone who can refresh a buff every 10 seconds on the red drake and someone who can heal one target (red drake) + maintain a 3 stack dot on the green drake =&gt; Deathrate considerably lowered.<br />
- no user interface bug of the green drake during the final boss Haven't heard of that one. So, okay, I guess. (are you sure it's not an add-on -like bartender- messing with it ?)<br />
- no bad dps in your group, you need to convince your guild to take their mains or be lucky at the pickup lottery. Try having always the same team for this achievement, you need good group DPS, yes, but more important : good coordination. If someone is not good enough, tell him to improve or get replaced. However, overgearing gives more and more room for mistakes as time passes. Do not try this achievement with random pickup (either guildies or friendlist or pickups known for being good)<br />
<br />
And no, I don't think the nerf is justified. The hard heroic 5-man achievements were by far the most fun thing I did in Wotlk (respect your elders and watch him die were really cool).<br />
I'm just trying to understand the decision.<br />
Ironically, I don't mind it being nerfed. I don't think it was needed either, but the nerf is not a big deal as we're talking about almost a year-old content. If you wanted a challenge, you are 6 months late (badge gear makes it obsolete). If you just wanted your proto-drake, then who cares if Blizzard makes it easier for you ? nice for you, and none of everyone else's business. It's not as if they were handing a black qiraji battletank in everyone and his alts' mailboxes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2009-11-10, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The deal with Occulus and its relation to a &quot;PUG crazy world&quot; post 3.3, IMHO is this:<br />
<br />
At level 80, you know that, ideally, the people in your group have had 80 levels (or 55 with one class, then 25 with a deathknight) to learn their class. They have little excuse to not have LRND2*insertclassabreviationhere*<br />
<br />
A fresh 80 (which you CAN GET with the new LFG) hasn't necessarilly LRND2DRAGON. It's not even wholly reasonable, with the current attitude toward occulus, to expect many experienced players to magically know how to &quot;dragon&quot; in time for the 3.3 randomness.<br />
<br />
When you think of occulus, you do not think intuitive. Not by a long shot. Clearly blizzard realizes that &quot;unintuitive + PUG rush = bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
People getting ready to do Ulduar with their guild know what they are getting into, they know &quot;hey guess what, you're about to go from X class to Y vehicle, let's learn that stuff together!&quot; and away you go. Someone clicking &quot;random PUGness&quot; and praying they don't get &quot;that instance that they heard has vehicles that I'll just quit when I get it&quot; is counter to what blizz wants out of this new engine.<br />
<br />
Elite it up all you want, everyone is new once. With Occulus, you are new twice. That's the problem with the Occulus. Not everyone wants to be &quot;new at their class&quot; again at 80, so they dodge it. I can't really blame em, learning a &quot;second class&quot; for one instance that you likely skipped till now hardly seems time efficient to me.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hehe, learning a second class. It's 4 buttons. I understand if it's your first time that it's not going to be perfect right away. But you won't end up with 5 people not knowing what to do. If you have one or maybe even two people that never done occulus before they can just be carried and learn how to &quot;dragon&quot;. You have to read 4 spell descriptions. People in your group will tell you what to do. There are tons of guides. You actually already done quests with vehicles before so you know how it works.<br />
But apparently the average player in wow is just not that intelligent and i am super smart that i can learn to &quot;dragon&quot; in one run.<br />
<br />
Well, we tried to make a dungeon that is fun and a little different than all the other boring dungeons, but it's too hard to adapt! Let's nerf it so when you have 3 freshly dinged level 80 characters in your group you can just two man it when they fuck up. <br />
<br />
I understand. It's not fun/too hard. You wipe there for hours so no one wants to do it. But it is still really pathetic.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's not because occulus is hard or not fun but the other dungeons are easier and faster. So maybe they should just buff all the other dungeons so occulus is just as hard.</div></div><hr />

when i said remember when you were a new guy, I intended just that. not one who runs 1000 instances in TBC and then goes off to northrend. one who buys the game this month, gets into it, rolls a paly cause that sounds pretty damn hot when u read what this does, is specing ret talents, wears a shield and puts his RF on cause he thinks that way he makes more damage, and by the time he's lvl 40 he finds out there is an AH he can actually trade all this crappy stuff he never looted cause he didn't know what to do with in the 6 slots bag he has. <br />
<br />
but you forgot about that. yet of the millions accounts in wow, may be the 0.5% gets to read and write in forums, and let alone finding out what an enchant is. but you never been that way so how can you understand it. I said hopefully someone in blizz does, cause they're obviously a smart business firm that wants to maintain their number 1 position.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, it took me 11 runs to get it. All the other only required one run (with sometimes a shitload of wipes, but that's where the fun lied). So to me it was much harder than the others.<br />
<br />
<br />
You needed a perfect run to do it, assuming we're talking about players at the level of skill+gear heroics are intended for (no overgearing by miles), yes, i agree, but that's the challenge and the interest, everyone needs challenges) <br />
<br />
<br />
We agree here. Challenge (and fashion) is the only thing I look for in the game. Glory to the Hero was great for this.<br />
<br />
<br />
- no disconnect from MT or heal during a pull - okay, luck-based, but unless your tank has chronical disconnect, not a big deal (try changing your tank otherwise) and definitely not a developer/designer's side problem. There are tons of other disconnect-friendly content in this game.<br />
<br />
Shit happens, and when it happens, no way you can recover and still get the timer. And you start again the day after. Hopefully with the same people, most often with new ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- no stupid aggro from a drake during the platforms trash or the second boss. Part of the challenge, deal with it. If necessary, run the normal instance studying a good path and have your group train at it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I ran the Occulus many times, I know the pathing by heart. I know the 'drake-that-looks-far-away-on-second-boss-but-needs-to-be-killed-anyway'. But shit happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- no stupid whelp going evade on your way to Eregos. Not a problem, doesn't prevent you from killing him in the timer. Plus you just have to run out of range and they will either move away from obstacles or de-aggro.<br />
<br />
<br />
Believe it does when the priest and druid unmounted to buff the dragons.. :)<br />

<br />
I agree, but I saw both of those happens to group members. Not always bad players. Stress of the timer sometimes makes people play silly. It happened to me a couple of times, when we're 2% away from a first down I tend to forget my rotation and press buttons like a retard apparently thinking pressing faster will bring the dps up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- no user interface bug of the green drake during the final boss Haven't heard of that one. So, okay, I guess. (are you sure it's not an add-on -like bartender- messing with it ?)<br />
<br />
It was Dominos indeed. Unpleasant discovery with 4 minutes left, and Eregos telling you to come back the day after.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
- no bad dps in your group, you need to convince your guild to take their mains or be lucky at the pickup lottery.

You seem to have a nice server where everyone plays perfect, can come from a achievement when you want and where baddies listen to advice without insulting you.<br />

Amber: Buffable DD attack, AoE stun, (unlocked) Channeled +Damage taken debuff that buffs your DD attack<br />

So yes, it is entirely reasonable to expect someone to read the &quot;hey, what does this dragon do&quot; from the NPCs, mount on the dragon, and read the goddamn ability tooltips.<br />
<br />
<br />
I blame questhelper.. Rogues don't feint, Mages don't know how to mirror image and retridins play with RF on thinking that their melee ability's deal no HOLY damage And because they were so dumb to specialize in improved RF for &quot;survivability&quot;.. <br />

You seem to have a nice server where everyone plays perfect, can come from a achievement when you want and where baddies listen to advice without insulting you.<br />
Believe it or not, I'm on a crappy server. 25 man raid progression is pretty low (Best Ulduar guild on Mimiron HM, best ToGC guild on twins), and we have a very bad reputation among french sevrers for being a noob nest (though we're working with a few other guilds to make things a bit better)<br />
<br />
I'm just saying that for a couple achievements (make it count, and possibly the 3 voids) you just have to get out of the PUG-rush routine.</div></div><hr />

Next thing you will do is complain how &quot;Casuals QQed so much on forums&quot; that they needed a nerf in Occulus.<br />
<br />
Well, I think the reality is, that Blizzard monitors how many Instances are run on a daily basis on every server (the sheer fact that they have a site with tolists indicates this is true) and they will see that hardly anybody does the Occulus, even when it is a daily.<br />
<br />
So there are two solutions:<br />
<br />
Version A: &quot;Our customers are all terribads, they need to suck it up and learn&quot;<br />
Version B: &quot;This Instance was done with all good intentions and does have a lot of novelty. But it is just not being accepted&quot;<br />
<br />
Version A: = Opinion of general forum nerds<br />
Version B: = Opinion of a decent company</div></div><hr />

<br />
now if they could just give an option to skip all the jousting crap in TOC5 that'll fine.<br />
<br />
i'm not against vehicles, but jousting is boring especially when you then have to kill them normally afterwards anyway, and occulus just sucked especially when working with noobs on the last boss. Malygos + FL are much more fun vehicle events.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xiangu</div><div class="date">2009-11-10, 10:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously people.. if you really played Oculus because you needed a challenge you are the ones that suck.. if you just played it for the daily heroic and I'm just assuming there is no other reason you could possibly want to go there.. just be glad it's even faster now than it used to be.. <br />
<br />
Now to address a few of the more ridiculous/not fully thought through statements:<br />
<br />
A) Since the vehicle buff it's already a joke -&gt; I have 150k life now<br />
<br />
Well if your drake has 150k life I'm assuming you're playing somewhere within the t9/t9.5 bracket.. be it known to you that there are still people dinging to 80 every day and if they step freshly into oculus their life is more around 70k life - their damage still only a third of what your drake might be doing...<br />
<br />
B) People are bad if they don't know how to press 2 buttons<br />
<br />
On the contrary - people are just uninformed in most cases.. you can even teach a monkey how to press 2 buttons - that doesn't make him any more intelligent than any other monkey.. you just showed him what to do. Heck.. if you complain about your group wiping in Oculus (and it can and will happen even with more nerfs to the dungeon) just tell your fellow party members what the hell they're supposed to do<br />
<br />
C) &quot;ohhhh it's so damn easy to heal all of the damage in Oculus even in bad gear&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know what the fuck you call bad gear (I'm guessing T7/T8 here..) but if you just got to 80 which is the only requirement to enter any heroic dungeon you will most likely have more difficulties healing through Oculus than described by you.. unless you're a shaman.. then maybe you can manage to keep everyone alive and still manage not to run oom...<br />
<br />
As a personal note I welcome the change to Oculus.. hell they can really nerf down all heroic dungeons if it's up to me.. there was no real challenge in there to begin with so why complain about nerfs of already easy content - that just fastens up the process of clearing these unwanted little fellows.</div></div><hr />

Why not make daily heroic quest, so that you go to quest giver, take quest and travel to heroic, but there is no monsters at all and all you need to do is run to end of instance to receive your reward.

Quite simple - you don't do these quests alone and if you don't happen to have 4 people at hand you might end up with total strangers.. particularly with the new random lfg tool.. now most people will overgear any content of the game but there might be some total strangers who just got to 80 and those might just be wearing blues/greens..

i enjoyed the instance up to the last part, but then it was just a wipefest. <br />
<br />
people have 80 levels to learn how to play their class, become good at the game as they know it.<br />
<br />
you have 1 attempt... about 30 seconds, to learn how to use your drake effectively on the last boss.<br />
<br />
its nothing to do with difficulty, whether or not its boring... its to do with the fact that its nothing to do with how you have played for 80 levels. So if it is anyones first time there (or maybe they just havent done it for a while) they would always die.<br />
<br />
Its a very wise move on blizzards part to make the last boss easier, all that would have happened is you chose random heroic, occ came up, group disbanded, you had to wait 15 minutes to try again.<br />

it wasnt working as intended when i could clear bosses in TOC25, yet had never managed to do occ on heroic.<br />

Well, i agree with your post to an extent. They already nerfed this dungeon once when they first had the drakes scale with the gear scores and make the drakes just that much easier, extra health and damage done right there. This dungeon was not that hard if you have done it at least once like you said, reason for the non heroic version. Its true while in a pug, you see some very strange things, but come in reg occ you could not die in there unless you tried. Even after the first patch when they made the dungeon easier, people just were not willing to try the dungeon again. first impression of this dungeon was bad for most people. People dont go into this dungeon because its so called &quot;hard&quot;, but because they dont like the fights, they dont like the fact that there is a chance they will die because they dont know what they are doing, even though its not exactly rocket science. I agree on the part that i liked it :P up to the last part, maybe the dungeon would of been a littler bit easier if they had more fights in this dungeon with the drakes instead of just the random mobs flying in the middle of nowhere, maybe if they gave people their third attack before they had to confront the main boss of the dungeon, but once again, this is why there is a reg mode in my eyes, use pugchecker.com and tell me how many people you see that have actually gone into a regular mode occ. so it all really does come down to the first impression. again, even after the first nerf, nobody wanted to give it a chance, not even for the now insainly easy to get red proto drake (note, the only truely hard achievement on the list now would be the less-rabi)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yomiko</div><div class="date">2009-11-10, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Occulus sucks, end of it. It needed to be nerfed because nobody wanted to do it. It was the daily heroic on my server a few days ago and NOBODY in trade or LFG was looking to do it all day. Blizzard realized that the instance stinked and needed to be nerfed so the group isn't killed if the random-heroic daily picks Occulus. <br />
I've only done Occulus once. I was in almost full level 70 epics and it was 5 days after WoTLK hit, I never entered that instance again. <br />
<br />
Not to mention that the dragons in Occulus suck. I leveled my character to PLAY as my character. Having all this vehicle stuff thrown at us sucks. I don't care if I'm riding on a dragon shotting lazers I want to kill the darn thing with my own spells and abilities. No wonder the only heroic with vehicles is the least ran...geesh Blizzard, at least I got to kill turrets on Leviathan with my own abilities. <br />
<br />
As for the Frostwyrm, for the love of silly string let it be a long/annoying rep grind. Let the raiders have bigger ones with 310% speed but the casuals want a frostwyrm too. I'm not talking about a little baby rep grind either (to make it seem the effort). Start off hated and have to kill thousands of mobs or something just to start doing long, annoying daily quests. Anything to stop the whiney little hardmode raiders from crying. Make it an ugly color too if you want (not like it'll matter in shadowform...lol).<br />
<br />
I'm perfectly able to do hardmodes. I've done many myself but its really unfair to the other population who just want to get one without having to be in a hardmode guild. Raiders get EVERYTHING, and in BC Nether-rays and Nether-drakes were everywhere, but the rep grind still took time and was semi-annoying with the racing.<br />
<br />
Blizzard please consider everyone before making it Hard-Mode/Invincible only~!</div></div><hr />
