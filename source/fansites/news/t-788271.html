It's a question you've been asking us for a little while now. And, based on all the posts, emails, petitions, and letters we received following the announcement that the Insane in the Membrane achievement would no longer be in available in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, we started to wonder if maybe we had gone a bit loco.<br />
<br />
So, we went back to the drawing board. After carefully reviewing all the feedback and discussing the matter amongst ourselves, we're now happy to report that we will be making the following changes to the Feat of Strength:<br />
<br />
<br />
Exalted reputation with Shen'dralar will no longer be required. As this is the only reputation that will be unobtainable in Cataclysm, we've simply decided to remove it as a requirement.<br />
<br />
For those who already earned Exalted reputation with this faction, don't worry -- we haven't forgotten about your accomplishments. In a future patch, we'll be adding in a separate Feat of Strength to recognize your deep love of Dire Maul.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bloodsail Buccaneer faction reputation will remain in-game. Also, to ensure that this change does not negatively affect Cataclysm quest progression in Stranglethorn Vale, Booty Bay Bruisers will now provide reputation up through Exalted.<br />
<br />
<br />
This will ensure that players will still be able to attain Insane in the Membrane and &quot;The Insane&quot; title in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Please note, however, that these changes will not take effect until The Shattering in patch 4.0.3a -- excluding the separate &quot;Exalted with Shen'dralar&quot; feat, which will be introduced in a future, but currently-undetermined patch.<br />
<br />
And, of course, those who are already Insane in the Membrane will retain their title and current Feat of Strength. Shine on, you crazy diamonds.</div></div><hr />

except if said FoS gives another extra title. either way, I don't think just an extra FoS is worth the 50k gold it would take to get to exalted</div></div><hr />

A lot of us have spent A LOT of gold on PBDs and librams the last month, because we thought it wouldn't be obtainable anymore. Getting a new FoS doesn't mean anything. We wanted The Insane. Now it's not The Insane anymore. <br />

Maybe, if I QQ enough, I will get Scarab Lord aswell. Right Blizzard?</div></div><hr />

it's just a feat of strength - nothing more. Perhaps they'd add a title to it or something later on.</div></div><hr />

Even though I never did it I hope blizz gives u guys who stood out with it a title also, or atleast a FoS that refers to Cypress Hill.</div></div><hr />

I didn't even bother starting the grind seeing as a FoS is hardly worth 50-100k gold or what have you and tons of time, but I might in Cata depending on what factions remain in the achievement.</div></div><hr />

DMF just takes money, and goblins/pirates just takes a few days of mindless one shot mob killing. shendralar was the only one that forced you to do insane amounts of work, tons of money and left you with a serious desire to never ever ever ever ever touch DM ever again. this title just got nerfed to the point of ease (but will still require several thousand gold and a few weeks/months of work so it will go from rare to very uncommon)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do have a question though, I believe last I read that Knot is being removed from Dire Maul, I've already fixed my rep with the goblins so they'll stop attacking me (annoying little buggers) but I am already sharpening my blades to get ready to destroy it all over again in the name of exalted Bloodsail rep... Without Knot, that means the only way to grind the rep back up without going in the negatives with the Bloodsail would be to go after the 5 rep pirates of the barrens and tanaris?</div></div><hr />

You realize the only reason you spent all that gold in the first place was an FoS? Yes? Okay.<br />
Look, it's not THAT FoS we're after. We are after a FoS that is really hard to get (aka Insane In The Membrane). If you remove Shen'dralar from it, it is ridiculosly easy to get. It will no longer give us the satisfaction we are/were after.</div></div><hr />

How does the pirates giving rep till exalted make that any better for the questflow in STV?<br />

Having limited time titles and achievements and mounts is the least Blizzard could do for its dedicated playerbase.<br />

This, Shen'dralar was the only hard one tbh and now its removed. I dont care at all about lost money since it wont be hard to get em back, its just the fact that now its jus a simple grind pirates achivment (and buy/farm junkboxes and cards the easiest part)</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I am happy that I can still finish my achievement, I'm sad that they made it easier for future people to get this. :( Well maybe not that easy. The main rep quests for Steemwheedle Cartel &quot;Free Knot&quot; and &quot;Gordok Ogre Suit&quot; weren't there last time I logged on Beta. This makes it more of a pain for people to get seeing how they are now forced to grind pirates for a long... long... long time. I hope they keep it that way.<br />

Maybe the new shendralar FoS will give a title as well, in which case this all would just be unjustified and premature whining. After all, since Shendralar's the only hard part about it, only the real insane people would have that new one. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
^This. If the FoS for being exalted with the Shen'dralar gives us an equally badass title, or even a mount, I'll be ok with this. On my server,the title told me that the person spent countless hours, at least 50k gold, and a lot of sanity on grinding for a rare title. Now all it tells me is that the person spent a week on an easy FoS.</div></div><hr />

DMF just takes money, and goblins/pirates just takes a few days of mindless one shot mob killing. shendralar was the only one that forced you to do insane amounts of work, tons of money and left you with a serious desire to never ever ever ever ever touch DM ever again. this title just got nerfed to the point of ease (but will still require several thousand gold and a few weeks/months of work so it will go from rare to very uncommon)<br />

100% with u, got done for 2 days ago :S</div></div><hr />

You realize the only reason you spent all that gold in the first place was an FoS? Yes? Okay.<br />
<br />
Hahaha, I completely agree! They did it all for a FoS and a title. Now for all their hard work, they get an extra FoS that almost no one else will have. Not to mention they can all still brag about how they did the Insane grind back when it was actually insane, which you know they will be doing anyhow. QQ less. I'm glad that it isn't getting removed.</div></div><hr />

If the FoS for being exalted with the Shen'dralar gives us an equally badass title, or even a mount, I'll be ok with this. On my server,the title told me that the person spent countless hours, at least 50k gold, and a lot of sanity on grinding for a rare title. Now all it tells me is that the person spent a week on an easy FoS.<br />
<br />
No way anyone could get it done in a week, even with Shen'dralar removed. Stop being so dramatic. Saying people deserve ANOTHER title or even a mount (lolol) for grinding out a rep they decided to grind out simply for the original FoS/title is ridiculous. Be happy Blizzard cares enough to give you guys an extra FoS for the work you put in, I think that is nice of them considering they could just take out Shen'dralar rep and be done with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Blizz you may aswell change the Insane title now to something more applicable.<br />
<br />
Come on wake up! This is not about &quot;i am more insane then you, because you finished the title in ctaclysm, so gimme ponies and tabard&quot;. This whole thing is about the BLUE POST that was announced in 2009 november, stating &quot;dont worry guys, we're not removing Insane in Cataclysm so no rush, take it easy&quot;. Then, a random Q&amp;A panel said on blizzcon, some weeks ago: &quot;Ohmwell, say bb to Insane in Cata.&quot;<br />
People who ALREADY worked themselves to midway in Insane went crazy, for reason, its very unfair to them just cut off their hard work. So what else could blizz do? Let them finish the achievement as they PROMISED. This has nothing to do with people who will START the work when cata hits. It's the compensation for those who were stucked in the middle of shit in wotlk.<br />
Would be good if people could see further than their nose.</div></div><hr />

Actually except for the Shen'dralar (which was because there were very few PBDs in the AH) It took me less than a week of time played to get it. Goblins took me 2 days of grinding Free Knot, Bloodsail only took me 5 hours of farming Booty Bay Bruisers, and on my rogue it only took me 2 days of farming LBRS for the lockboxes. DMF was easy b/c there were tons of Prisms, Chaos, and Undeath decks in the AH for 200-300g each.</div></div><hr />

I actually got it done in a week. I've spent 10hours per day farming stuff for Shen'dralar, with help of my girlfriend and 30k+gold invested, but I got it done in a week.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I'd be quite fine with that - I really don't care who else has the ICC25 mount/achievement besides my guild. It's a bunch of pixels that give people an undeserved sense of self-importance, especially in case of achievs like Justicar which is a straight rep grind. Yey, you were able to grind WSG for 12 hours/day - here's a cookie, but can you actually PvP? - that is the ultimate test of a PvPer, not some title.</div></div><hr />

Now instead of getting 1 feat of strength and a title, you get 2 feats of strength and a title. <br />

Also to the people complaining about things being &quot;handed out&quot; this is nothing new. I spent months farming Timbermaw rep in TBC, getting 1 point for every furlbog i killed. When Wrath hit, they made it so anyone with a few hours spare could get it. <br />

The title is &quot;The Insane&quot;, implying an extreme amount of time, effort, and gold to complete. Removing the longest and most annoying of the exalted requirements to leave the title in the game greatly reduces the significance of the title and is a slap in the face to all of those players who truly are insane and have already taken the special measures to secure Shen'dralar reputation. Giving those players another feat of strength just for being Shen'dralar exalted is a weak fix when you are weakening their awesome title they worked so hard to procure. I'm very disappointed with this decision.</div></div><hr />

I'm not so sure this will be easy. The biggest factor are the rumors about Knot Thimblejack's quest being removed from DM North. If this is true, the grind to exalted with all the goblin factions will be absolutely brutal compared to running DM North over and over.<br />

No, this is not another &quot;let-me-whine-because-I-just-wasted-50k-gold-on-an-achievement&quot; post...I received my &quot;the Insane&quot; title almost 2 years ago. I didn't buy a single libram or diamond and leveled up a rogue to 60 just to farm junkboxes. And yes, all you &quot;well goodie for you, just be happy you have it&quot; trolls, I indeed was very happy with my title...only a handful of us even had it on one of the most populated realms. What actually kind of made me laugh was how every Tom, Dick and Harry started complaining about libram/diamond/DMF prices and how it was unfair because &quot;it was something I always wanted to do, but kept putting it off&quot;. When were you going to start? When you weren't pressured for content? Oh wait.... :) <br />
<br />
I was even fine with people scrambling to finish Shen'dralar and completing the rest of the FoS when Cata came out/when they had time (as I understand everyone's play times are different).<br />
<br />
But to completely take it out of the requirement? It is indeed a slap in the face to everyone who has 1) completed it 2) those who just spent anywhere from 20k-50k gold trying to finish it...based on Blizz's statements of it's changes and 3) those who sold all the mats they had been hanging onto for who knows how long because they figured they'd never be able to finish it in time...based on Blizz's statements of it's changes...<br />

Whelp, to those have/are about to complete it, cheer up mates! We get our very own FoS (supposedly :))!! ...without a title (for the moment) or anything to distinguish the &quot;real&quot; Insanes. Yep, &quot;sounds like a good compromise&quot; indeed :)<br />

I even made two topics on the wow forums which were immediately deleted. The first one was simply a record of what I did to get the title, the time and money invested to attain each portion, and how the changes affected it in the future. Shen'dralar took well over half the time and far more than half the money investment to get the title. The second post was slightly more bitter, but essentially said the same with with one addition, that the new Feat of Strength come with the title *Bent Over*<br />
<br />
They have even messed up the Bloodsail admiral reps. Did you know getting the last bit, revered to exalted requires one to kill two mobs, in different zones 4200 times for 5 rep each kill? They have a 5-8 minute spawn timer leading to 350 to 560 hours of farming? Come cata with guards giving 25 rep with a super fast respawn and far larger amount of them thats a single nights farming. <br />
<br />
All up, it was insane to get, now with shen'dralar, human racial, guild perks and thanksgiving buff, its gone from a solid 6 to 12 months work and up to 200k gold to a month, maybe two of solid farming to get. Less if timed right.<br />

as for a FoS for Shen'dralar .. wow what a lame way to try and make this look like a good thing.<br />
<br />
Stop pandering to people who couldn't be bothered to grind this FoS when it meant something, and leave the achievement for those of us who did.. I've personally farmed ZG for over 4 years, nigh on every reset with no mount drop (until i got my tiger yesterday WOOHOO) but if i started whining about the removal of Zg and my chance of a raptor gone ... would you suddenly change your mind on this too ?<br />

It's a FEAT OF STRENGTH .. you're not entitled to it being in the game, that's the point of them.</div></div><hr />

Seriously Blizzard what are you on? Insane in the Membrane was not THAT hard anyway. First you nerf it to the ground, by letting people have it whitout farming Knot (ok technically it was not a nerf on all realms, if you had a very thin supply of PBD and librams, there is NO WAY in hell you wouldn't farm Dire Maul anyway for librams, and while you are at it, free Knot... I got exalted with Steamwheedle before Shendralar so i would have wasted my time not freeing Knot). And now this? And don't let me start about Darkmoon trinkets going boe instead of bop, which also nerfed the achievement big time (well for people who don't know how to make money at least, for people with a brain, it was still easy before that).</div></div><hr />

Of course they make it easier. Of course they do. Why wouldn't they? The lesson here is never do anything ever 'cause its gonna get nerf'd. <br />
<br />
Okay that's enough nerd rage. Honestly this is great, cutting the achievement out completely was a bad idea from the get go. I am annoyed that I spent so much time in Dire Maul, but thats how it goes. Even if I knew this was coming I probally wouldn't of changed anything. Having the insane to brag about is great.</div></div><hr />

If you're worried about &quot;The Insane&quot; being devalued, a quick glance at the date on that will tell anyone whether it was the original or ez(er)mode version. Or the extra FoS that Blizz is planning on giving those that completed it early. Then at least you can tell if your epeen is bigger than theirs. Or that you had way more time/money at your disposal...<br />

Either way, does it REALLY matter so much that it warrants all the hooplah? I understand being disappointed over the change, but some of the rage and resentment on display here is a bit over the top in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the moment this FoS (in its original state) was announced I started grinding out mats and buying crap off of the AH before prices skyrocketed. I was exalted with all four factions in the Steamwheedle Cartel and took my rep back down to hated and back up to exalted again because the big debate over whether you had to be simultaneously exalted with SWC and honoured with Bloodsail had not been solved yet. I spent hours hunting down bloods in WPL/EPL, and leveled up engineering solely for MOLL-E so I didn't have to run back and forth anymore to turn in librams in Ferelas, and killing every single last mob every DM run in the hopes of seeing a few diamonds. People who truly wanted this FoS would have it already or be close to completing it. I feel sorry for the people who AHed their items because they didn't think they could finish this rep up in time for the launch of Cata, but it sucks that all of these last minute scramblers and Johnny-Come-Latelies are getting the Care Bear treatment. I'm tired of this attitude that everyone deserves everything in the game. Like whiners who complain that the drop rate on the ZG mounts should be raised. If you wanted it, you would have been doing it from the start. RNG's a different story completely, but this required time and money. And so &quot;The Insane&quot; goes the way of so many other things in this progressively more and more dumbed down game.</div></div><hr />

But the thing is no one cares about a feat of strength. The only reason people were grinding and spending so much gold was they wanted to get a title that was no longer going to be obtainable. Having a title that no longer exists? Now that would have been worth blowing 50K+ gold.</div></div><hr />

Meh it's not even that. It's the fact that the title itself won't be considered &quot;the insane&quot; anymore. Removing a faction like this changes how it's viewed and changes the time consumed to obtain it. Might as well call it &quot;not as insane anymore&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, while completed Shen'dralar just a week ago myself it was a bit annoying to read the blue posts of the insane title today. It's not really the gold or time I spent on the rep that annoys me but rather the misleading information of the Insane title being removed that got me into doing the whole thing in a hurry.

<br />
I never thought I would see Blizzard nerf a Feat of Strength. Adding a separate FoS for Shen'dralar is, to be blunt, a slap in the face to people who earned Insane In The Membrane in its original form.<br />
<br />
Also, for the people who don't understand here is how you currently get to to Maximum Exalted with the Bloodsail Buccaneers.<br />
1. Grind from whatever your current reputation is by killing Booty Bay Bruisers (25 rep per kill) up to 11999 / 12000 Honored.<br />
2. Grind Jazzrik (5 rep per kill) from 11999/12000 Honored up to 20999/21000 Revered. This mob has a 5 minute respawn timer and requires 4200 (yes, four thousand two hundred) kills. That's 21,000 minutes, or 350 hours, or 5.83 days game time grinding.<br />
3. Grind High Admiral &quot;Shelly&quot; Jorrik (5 rep per kill) from 20999/21000 Revered up to 999/1000 Exalted. This mob has anywhere from a 5 hour to an 8 hour respawn timer.<br />
More information on this truly insane task here: http://www.saate.net/bloodsail-exalted-guide/<br />
<br />
This has been nerfed to:<br />
1. Grind from whatever your current reputation is up to 999/1000 Exalted by killing Booty Bay Bruisers (25 rep per kill).<br />
<br />
My only question is: Is there any other ways Blizzard would like to slap the truly insane players in the face or have they run out of ideas?</div></div><hr />

But those examples are different. This is for a title that was called The Insane for a reason. Nerfing it changes everything and it is in no way considered insane anymore. Not even close. So either change the title to something else if you don't have exalted with Shen'dralar come the new patch and allow people who are exalted to continue farming for the current title name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm, I know this thread isn't about this, but I can't help but pounce on this ignorance whenever I see it. There is nothing easier about the new talent trees. Is there anything harder? Depends on what you think is harder. It's utility VS damage, that's not a bad choice to have. At the very least, they are the same. You cannot possibly think the old talent trees had any choice at all in them, you either had the right spec or the wrong spec. A FEW trees had 1-2 variations but MOST of the NEW trees have that now, that's all that's changed.</div></div><hr />

Insane shouldn't be doable without Shen'dralar. Shen is probably the most time consuming and expensive parts of this grind, the ICC buff was for people that wern't hardcore raiders to be able to complete end game content with ease.</div></div><hr />

Why do you always do stuff like this ?!?! First i buy a 15k gold mount, and now you lower the price to 8k gold in cata !<br />
<br />
But dont get me started with the insane title !!! You talking about adding a extra achievement ( For those who love Dire Maul) well let me tell you something.......the insane part about this achievement aint about the grinding or farming herbs for dm cards........ the really insane part is that you have to spend either 200 hours+ if ur hoping to farm diamonds and librams urself, or spend 50k gold or more and buy it.<br />
Instead of a extra achievement we should get a even cooler title or a mount that shows how dedicated ppl was farming for this title, or just how insane we was to spend that kind of money on a title !!!!<br />
Or call cata insane ppl for Mini Insane or old ones for The Truely Insane !!!!!<br />
Please dont make this a title that all ppl can achieve now without being insane.<br />
<br />
I really hope you will think about making a huge diffrence with the title before and the title after Cata !!<br />

While I can see the frustration of those who have managed to grind out/spend a load of gold for the Shen'dralar rep (they should probably be rewarded with something more than just a FoS, since even gold takes time to earn...a title for that rep would be pretty neat to see on those rare folks), it was equally frustrating to be someone who's been forced offline for several months due to computer issues, and prior to said issues I was too busy running a guild and raiding while also juggling RL to really get any proper work done on this. I'd someday love to obtain this title, but have simply thus far haven't managed to find the insane amount of time require to achieve it. Therefor, I am super happy that it shall remain obtainable come the expansion.<br />

As someone had previously suggested, why not tack on a few more requirements for this title come Cataclysm? Toss in a bunch of BC reps into the mix, just to keep it more of a pain in the bottom to get?<br />

Pot. Kettle. Black. I think you're missing the fact that nobody was bitching about spending all the money and taking all the time, they were complaining about the time frame. In the new xpac, the only way Blizz could keep things together as far as story and this FoS go was to get rid of that one rep. If something crazy happened, and WoW ceased to exist tomorrow, all these digital things that make you feel like a special and unique snowflake would cease to exist and it wouldn't matter who did what when.

<br />
No, this is not another &quot;let-me-whine-because-I-just-wasted-50k-gold-on-an-achievement&quot; post...I received my &quot;the Insane&quot; title almost 2 years ago. I didn't buy a single libram or diamond and leveled up a rogue to 60 just to farm junkboxes. And yes, all you &quot;well goodie for you, just be happy you have it&quot; trolls, I indeed was very happy with my title...only a handful of us even had it on one of the most populated realms. What actually kind of made me laugh was how every Tom, Dick and Harry started complaining about libram/diamond/DMF prices and how it was unfair because &quot;it was something I always wanted to do, but kept putting it off&quot;. When were you going to start? When you weren't pressured for content? Oh wait.... :) <br />
<br />
I was even fine with people scrambling to finish Shen'dralar and completing the rest of the FoS when Cata came out/when they had time (as I understand everyone's play times are different).<br />
<br />
But to completely take it out of the requirement? It is indeed a slap in the face to everyone who has 1) completed it 2) those who just spent anywhere from 20k-50k gold trying to finish it...based on Blizz's statements of it's changes and 3) those who sold all the mats they had been hanging onto for who knows how long because they figured they'd never be able to finish it in time...based on Blizz's statements of it's changes...<br />
<br />
The ironic part? Shen'dralar was basically what even made it &quot;the Insane&quot;, lol. The rest is rather a joke.<br />
<br />
Whelp, to those have/are about to complete it, cheer up mates! We get our very own FoS (supposedly :))!! ...without a title (for the moment) or anything to distinguish the &quot;real&quot; Insanes. Yep, &quot;sounds like a good compromise&quot; indeed :)<br />
<br />
Fake edit: to the trolls who will post about &quot;epeens&quot; and &quot;it's just a game, nobody is unique&quot; etc, I acknowledge and even agree with you...but this has nothing to do with either. The achievement neither awarded nerd points, nor made me &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot;...but &quot;nerfing&quot; a FoS is rather ridiculous, considering they're intended to not always be achievable. <br />
<br />
Just my 2c...flame away :)<br />
<br />
Right there with you bro, just finished mine finally a couple weeks ago and this announcement really ticked me off... if they went and made another similar achievement with another title and gave it to people that didn't get the Shen'dralar rep in time, that would be cool. As it stands the new FOS should include everything from the old achievement and maybe add the title &quot;The Disturbed&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
hmmm, actually, &quot;the Disturbed&quot; would be a helluva comsolation prize.... Blizz, we may have an answer!</div></div><hr />

By your reckoning Blizz should remove ALL of the mounts and title-related rep and raid achievements after two years. So that's no Winterspring Saber, no Venomhide Ravasaur, no Guardian of Cenarius, no Rusted Proto etc etc.<br />
It's been a long twisty-turny two years, and in that time Blizzard made the very sensible choice of LEAVING things in game, untouched. So that all of the new subscribers could obtain vanity items (yes, titles ARE counted as vanity) long afterwards, and were not penalised (as I was with the Plagued and Black drakes) for starting the raiding game late.<br />
Get a grip, all you crazy diamonds have had Insane before anyone else did. Try not to complain because now everyone's got a shot at it without being forced to rush like hell and to shell out 100k gold to get it done before 4.0.3 hits. Fixing Shen'dralar, that's Blizz's business as to why they haven't. But clearly their customers want it, so they've left it in.<br />

Oh and one more thing; For all of those just exhalted with Shen'dralar, what if Blizz had completely broken the achi and you wouldn't get it after 4.0.3 despite only having DMF to go? Oh I can imagine the tears... It'd be nice to see all the player base grateful for something for once.</div></div><hr />

Shallow you say... why yes it is. :)<br />

You poor bastards that did the Bloodsail to exalted have my sympathies... couldn't bring myself to do that one. You should get something as well.<br />

<br />
The original feat of strenth was around for 2 years, and the faction itself for 5. If you dont have it by now you shouldn't have it. <br />
<br />
I feel even worse for the very few people who have had bloodsail exalted before this, as the guy above me said. <br />
<br />
Bottom line I will simply ask everyone who calims to be the insane to link Shendralar, same way I tell every so called Battlemaster to link Justicar. <br />
<br />
Blizzard was right to remove it in the first place. I would LOVE to have Scarab Lord, but it can't be had anymore and so be it. I missed out. I didnt put in the time back when it was current content. Same should be said to those who did not complete the Insane on time.</div></div><hr />

Pristine Black Diamonds are going for 750-1500g each. I don't feel like dropping potentially 140k gold on a simple title that I know my friends got for a fraction of the price months ago. I'm glad they're removing Shen'dralar personally. It sucks huge balls to the people who got their librams, bloods, aboms and PBDs and dropped a lot of gold. It's unfortunate PBD's are so rare and expensive.</div></div><hr />

I´m happy to hear this, past week(s) i gave away/sold the few things i had saved up randomly for Shen'dralar since<br />
i realised i would never have time to finish it in the time that was left. Atleast i´ll be able to do &quot;... the Insane&quot; it in Cata, when i get<br />
the time and feel like it, and can mix it up with all the new stuff the expansion brings.<br />

I've done Shen'Dralar, and I've got to say, it's way easier and far less time-consuming than the Goblin Grind (Bloodsail up then the Trade Factions).<br />
<br />
Yeah, I wouldn't mind a special title for having done it, I'm a title whore, and &quot;Keristrazja of the Shen'Dralar&quot; is one I'd wear proudly just to annoy people who waited and waited.<br />
<br />
Shit happens, deal with it. I can't get Scarab Lord, or any of the PvP ranks on my main (Draenei from the beginning of BC), or the old Arena titles, but that's the way it works.<br />
<br />
Remember one important truth about WoW– you are entitled to pay $15/mo (or whatever it is in your currency) to get whatever the hell Blizz gives you, and that's IT. If at the end of the day Blizz chooses to make bows shoot with fart sounds and give lv1 critters GodMode, that's what you'll get, and you'll keep right on playing like good little sheep.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tabularasa79</div><div class="date">2010-11-11, 06:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, If i decide i want to get exalted with bloodsail after having completed the insane title, I need to go back to bootybay and kill 880 goblins for 22,000 rep. Then that will decrease my booty rep by 110,000 putting me back all the way to hated again. So since I took the time to do all this before cata, I get to do the worst part of the whole feat of strength again... and farm dire maul for 50 hrs... seriously? This is my reward, that and a crappy feat of strength? TY blizz</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, this is not another &quot;let-me-whine-because-I-just-wasted-50k-gold-on-an-achievement&quot; post...I received my &quot;the Insane&quot; title almost 2 years ago. I didn't buy a single libram or diamond and leveled up a rogue to 60 just to farm junkboxes. And yes, all you &quot;well goodie for you, just be happy you have it&quot; trolls, I indeed was very happy with my title...only a handful of us even had it on one of the most populated realms. What actually kind of made me laugh was how every Tom, Dick and Harry started complaining about libram/diamond/DMF prices and how it was unfair because &quot;it was something I always wanted to do, but kept putting it off&quot;. When were you going to start? When you weren't pressured for content? Oh wait....<br />
<br />
I was even fine with people scrambling to finish Shen'dralar and completing the rest of the FoS when Cata came out/when they had time (as I understand everyone's play times are different).<br />
<br />
But to completely take it out of the requirement? It is indeed a slap in the face to everyone who has 1) completed it 2) those who just spent anywhere from 20k-50k gold trying to finish it...based on Blizz's statements of it's changes and 3) those who sold all the mats they had been hanging onto for who knows how long because they figured they'd never be able to finish it in time...based on Blizz's statements of it's changes...<br />
<br />
The ironic part? Shen'dralar was basically what even made it &quot;the Insane&quot;, lol. The rest is rather a joke.<br />
<br />
Whelp, to those have/are about to complete it, cheer up mates! We get our very own FoS (supposedly )!! ...without a title (for the moment) or anything to distinguish the &quot;real&quot; Insanes. Yep, &quot;sounds like a good compromise&quot; indeed<br />
<br />
Fake edit: to the trolls who will post about &quot;epeens&quot; and &quot;it's just a game, nobody is unique&quot; etc, I acknowledge and even agree with you...but this has nothing to do with either. The achievement neither awarded nerd points, nor made me &quot;one-of-a-kind&quot;...but &quot;nerfing&quot; a FoS is rather ridiculous, considering they're intended to not always be achievable.<br />
<br />
Just my 2c...flame away <br />

It's the same principle when you buy a new car. If you've really struggled to save up money to finally buy the car you want, and some weeks after you've gotten it, the car company decides to give that model a 20% discount. What are you gonna do about it? Go back and demand that you get 20% of the money you spent back?

Yeah, you can make all the cutesy analogies youd like, but the fact remains that this was extremely poorly handled, and made Blizzard look really wishy-washy.<br />
<br />
They came out with a blue post that said Insane would be fine, then people relaxed. They said it would not be obtainable, and people spent a bunch of gold and time in a panic. Then they folded to the pressure of people, and nerfed it, screwing over those who had scrambled.<br />
<br />
I understand that they have the option to change content at will, but dicking us around on something so costly and time consuming, was pretty unprofessional and very inconsiderate.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raelbo</div><div class="date">2010-11-11, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps the saddest thing about this nerf is that it was most likely the result of complaints by people who were upset that now they would never get to do the grind they wanted to do &quot;some day&quot;. But in all honesty, I doubt most of those people would ever have gone and done it anyway, for exactly the same reason that they hadn't done it (or at least made some real progress) already.<br />
<br />
The people who had a legitimate gripe were those who had already committed to the FoS, both time and gold (and gold is basically time anyway) and would not be able to finish it. I personally think that removing the ability to gain Shen'dralar rep, but allowing those who were already Shen'dralar exalted to finish up in Cata (which is what it looked like was going to happen) would have been a good compromise. What we already saw was people who were miles away dropped the idea, sold their Librams and PBD's, made a huge profit, and provided the mats for those who were close to finishing it to do so. <br />
<br />
Now the problem is that the solution has become too lenient and devalued the title &quot;insane&quot; for those who already have it.<br />
<br />
However I think a lot of the outcryers need a bit of perspective on this: Removing Shen'dralar from the requirements does not trivialise the achievement. Yes, it makes it less difficult, but it is still a lot of work. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, whether you have to grind mobs for rep/items, or pay gold for rep, it amounts to the same thing: You are sinking time and effort into the achievement. If you put a monetary value on time spent (basically how much gold you can grind per hour), then it becomes very easy to evaluate the overall effort of Insane in the Membrane. My experience is that it was a 320 hour game time achievement of which about 80% could be bought for gold (at 500g per hour). Of that the total time devoted per part of the achievement could be divided up as follows:<br />
<br />
Shen'dralar: 37.5%<br />
Darkmoon Faire: 37.5%<br />
Bloodsail Buccaneers: 2.5%<br />
Goblins: 10%<br />
Ravenholdt: 12.5%<br />
<br />
<br />
And before people start saying Shen'dralar is more difficult than this because other reps can be easily obtained for money, 80% of the Shen'dralar effort could be managed as a simple gold grind (I spent about 100 hours of game time earning gold to pay for diamonds, shards and librams, 18 hours farming Blood of Heroes and Skins of Shadow and 2 hours actually running to DM and handing in using my Argent Gruntling). <br />
<br />
So really, removing Shen'dralar has reduced the difficulty of the FoS by 37.5% or 3/8. Most people who can do the other 5/8 would probably have been able to complete Shen'dralar anyway. That being said, I think that people who did actually get Shen'dralar to exalted do need some more recognition than just another title. I have 2 solutions:<br />
<br />
Create a title for having Shen'dralar exalted. For example: &quot;of the Shen'dralar&quot; <br />
Create a second title for being both exalted with the Shen'dralar and Insane. For example: &quot;the Clinically Insane&quot; or &quot;the Utterly Insane&quot;. The second title would become the &quot;you had be there&quot; title and would certainly appease all those who did things the hard way.<br />
alternatively <br />
Award a special mount for being exalted with Shen'dralar. Since they are Elves, maybe a cat for Horde and a Hawkstrider for alliance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boohoo you lost your uniqueness by the removal of &quot;Shen'Dralar&quot;. I'm one of the aspiring insaners who will complete it in Cataclysm, <br />
due to Blizzard not being able to make up their mind. When having it verified from various different sources that &quot;Insane in the Membrane&quot; would infact remain in Cataclysm I DID slack because I was informed of the 10% increased reputation from guild leveling. Now you can't call me a slacker for wanting 10 % extra rep, That's just playing smart.<br />
<br />
Imagine my kick in the balls when I later find out i have one month to complete the ENTIRE FoS , I do not support Account Hacking nor bots therefore I do not buy gold. Nor am i terrribly rich which leaves me without the option of buying everything you need for the FoS (Insane indeed, AH farming is hard yes.) I wouldn't mind them keeping Shen'Dralar in Cataclysm, not at all I want to do the entire Achievement.<br />
BUT as someone stated above me, only a small few care about this FoS and I doubt blizzard will halt their expansion plannings just for it.<br />
Therefore this was the only solution. So please, Stop the god damned whining about us achieveing your uber-title without any effort. I didn't ask for them to remove Shen'Dralar, But I sure as hell am not going to suffer my title because blizzard change their minds more often than a fat kid being offered both a hamburger and a pizza.<br />
<br />
And before any of you come with your &quot;Boohooo you could've done it earlier!&quot; First off all, it isn't a very well advertized FoS. Secondly, as I mentioned above, I wanted it done as painless as possible, that don't make me a slacker, that puts me on the exact same level as the ones buying all the mats.<br />
<br />
Peace.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arinnaya</div><div class="date">2010-11-11, 11:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I originally typed up a huge massive post ranting about this and that but I'll put it more simply for effectiveness:<br />
<br />
1. We were promised that we could complete the Insane in Cataclysm - I'd started this grind, but for me it was not a &quot;spend 4 weeks rushing&quot; grind but a &quot;spend a year or so a little bit at a time&quot; sort of grind.<br />
2. Noone who complained about the removal of the Insane title was complaining about the requirements of the grind, only about the ability to complete it.<br />
3. A Feats of Strength are defined as &quot;accomplishments that players will find very difficult if not impossible to earn&quot; - the whole &quot;had to be there&quot; argument is BS because the fact is, I was there, I started my grind with a timeframe in mind (bearing in mind I was working towards Bloodsail Exalted and ended up wasting 240 hours worth of grinding on Jazzrik because they changed their minds) then they changed the goalposts.<br />
4. You shouldn't get anything extra for Shen'dralar since the criteria were laid out: Bloodsail to Honored, others to Exalted for the Insane in the Membrane FoS and title. You chose to do it based on that information, so it's tough if you regret your decision now. I say this as someone who has almost finished Shen'dralar, and will have it finished before Cataclysm, not because of the FoS but because I like to complete everything I can in the game.<br />

The whole idea that Blizzard are &quot;catering to casuals&quot; again is ridiculous - this isn't about casual/hardcore or anything like that. Noone wanted or asked for the removal of the Shen'dralar requirement. All people wanted was the chance to complete the Insane in Cataclysm, which they were promised.<br />
<br />
This solution is not, repeat NOT, the best solution for all parties, but the fact remains that you chose to do the grind when you did based on the requirements set forth, if they choose to make it easier down the line, then tough, you made the decision to complete that grind, not them.</div></div><hr />

In the new xpac, the only way Blizz could keep things together as far as story and this FoS go was to get rid of that one rep. If something crazy happened, and WoW ceased to exist tomorrow, all these digital things that make you feel like a special and unique snowflake would cease to exist and it wouldn't matter who did what when. Go drink a Pepsi and relax.<br />
<br />
and you're missing the fact that this is an FoS they're not obligated to keep it in either, but because of all the QQ they had to. look how many FoS are unobtainable now, and we will never see them again. it just like a kid in a supermarket screaming and crying for their mum to buy them a toy or some chocolate bar, and Blizzard caved in</div></div><hr />

The people that got the &quot;difficult&quot; version of the feat of strength will still be able to prove it by linking the achieve which will show the date, so they really lost nothing.<br />
<br />
The same holds true for rank 14. I have High Warlord, and even though they are bringing the title back, its ok by me because I'll always have the feat of strength to prove I got the vanilla version via the date stamp.</div></div><hr />

The Bloodsail Admiral title takes a couple of hours to get, you only have to be honored. Even if you were already exalted with all 4 of the Cartel reps it still only takes a few hours. There is no unique title for the the nuts for ground it out to exalted, just a sense of satisfaction that they did one of the hardest, if not THE hardest, rep grinds in the game.<br />

<br />
When they introduced Scarab Lord, they said that there would only be 10 hours from the first time the gong was rung to get the rewards. When the PVP titles were removed, they said they would be removed. Near the start of WotLK they said they'd be removing Champion of the Naaru and Hand of A'dal. Even for Zul'gurub and the various mounts/achievements/reputation with it they told us it would be removed.<br />
<br />
Do you see the difference here? They specifically said that the Insane WOULDN'T be removed. If, back in 2009, they'd said &quot;The Insane will be removed in Cataclysm&quot; or even if they'd said it a few months ago, there'd be some complaints, but not on the scale of backlash that there is now. To sum up, they have:<br />
<br />
1. told us it WOULD be in<br />
2. Didn't announce that they'd changed Shen'dralar rep, making the feat impossible<br />
3. If noone had mentioned it at Blizzcon we'd probably still be wondering<br />
4. They then proceed to tell us that some things are just &quot;had to be there&quot; completely contradicting their own words<br />
5. They finally give in to the justified complaints, but provide a solution that neither side wants particularly.<br />
<br />
If they'd said &quot;Zul'gurub is being removed and so is Insane in the Membrane&quot; people would have been able to accept that, because there would've been enough time to do something about it. However, they gave us little notice, and directly contradicted their own information several times. I don't believe it was a malicious attempt to screw people over, purely a case of misinformation and bad communication to its public.<br />
<br />
Sure there's some complaints over ZG being removed, but not nearly at the level of when they said Insane in the Membrane would be removed. Is that because more people care about the Insane than do ZG? No, it's just because ZG was a good example of how to communicate to your customers a game-changing decision. The way they handled the Insane was a good example of what NOT to do when communicating with your customers.</div></div><hr />

Completely removing a rep such a shen'dralar is just outright a slap in the face. FOS isn't that impressive for the work put in for it. For the people that say well you can just buy that rep. No you have to grind out blood of the heroes, skins of shadows, and abom stiches. That all is relative to what particular libram you have. I don't think asking for title or maybe something like a pet /mount would be too much to ask for. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arinnaya</div><div class="date">2010-11-11, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The answer shouldn't be rewarding players who completed the original grind, it should be about making the &quot;new&quot; grind be as difficult (roughly) as the old. To me there is no easier way to do this than to let Lorekeeper Lydros accept Libram turnins. He's still in Dire Maul, his gossip text still actually recognises whether you completed &quot;Elven Legends&quot; or not so why not just put the quests back in? Hell they could've avoided the whole disaster if they'd just lied and said &quot;Whoops, we didn't realise that we'd taken the Libram quests out, they're back in now though&quot;</div></div><hr />

Again, Pot. Kettle. Black.

So again, get over it.<br />
<br />
Again, if you got the titles a long time ago, of COURSE it's going to get easier. It ALWAYS has. And as people have posted before, Blizzard said that it would REMAIN in during Cataclysm...everyone just did a chicken little &quot;The sky is falling!&quot; when some Q&amp;A got messed up. Gee, that's never happened before.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the amount of &quot;I deserve this!&quot; is insane...it's a video game that could be turned off at any moment. I can't imagine how you guys would all react if they shut down WoW. &quot;But...but...can I take my title with me into the real world!? I worked SO hard for them!&quot; Either enjoy what you got from the grind you did, and who cares what others get...or STOP PLAYING THE GAME! It's a game that's constantly changing, and always making older things easier to get. They were never taking this FoS out of the game, so get over it. The FoS was NOT hard to get...it was a time sink. That's all. You chose to spend your time doing it, and you did. You got what they said you'd get...the end. Not hard.<br />
<br />
Everybody in here whining because you're no longer special can rest easy knowing that anyone who spends that much time in a game and then complains about it is indeed very &quot;special&quot;. <br />
<br />
The absolute best part of this...everyone saying they hate Blizz because they constantly do things like this will CONTINUE to pay them every month. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... /golf clap to whiners</div></div><hr />

except i'm not bitching to blizzard, starting petitions, writing letters for them to keep shen'dralar as a req for this FoS. i'm just agreeing with most other people here that they're taking a piss on this thing, half of the work that went into this title was that one rep but whatever, i'm still just gonna suck it up. so yeah im pissed off but not exactly a QQ sorry about that</div></div><hr />

You had 2 years to merely know about it, and you had previous expansions to even build up these reps. The fact that its now being removed oh, now people want it. Which is great for them, they can work their butt off to get something done in a few months if they so chose. This achievement was meant to be hard, it was meant to be insane. It was meant for those who only really were actively seeking it out.<br />
<br />
Blizzard got rid of the bear mount, why? Because if would be too easy to farm up come wrath, well the case with this title should stand. If you have to nerf it to where its initial value, prize, and overall 'insane-ness' is no longer there, why is it still there? There have been many things that have been removed in the past because they are simply just too easy to get anymore. Shendralar rep was the one thing stopping this achievement from being a huge cake walk, and the place where most of your money was dumped. <br />
<br />
No one is looking for an extra FoS. People ground out that rep FOR this title, for THIS FoS, and THIS FoS only, why would we want another, Why would we want to see people running around with the same title as ours that literally took them 1/2 the work, money, time &amp; dedication.<br />
<br />
Leaving it the way it was: 'get this done before cata, or too bad' was a good compromise. You let people know, and people who actually cared would have finished it off, and have and are doing so. But you should have just left it as that... not change it into some casual crap. <br />

Don't exaggerate here, some people claim the DMF component has taken them longer then Shen'dralar. And NO ONE farms DM ONLY until they hit exalted. They would actually spend most of their money, upwards to around 35 - 100k gold to complete it, just like DMF. It's almost as if your saying this achievement will be a cakewalk now. Why don't you actually try and do the achievement after the changes are made and when you finally complete it, you go tell me it was easy... Otherwise you're just trollin.</div></div><hr />

YES, it's bad handling by Blizz, YES, it's a very patched over job. But they're keeping it in there, for everyone who still wants it, and who was told they would not have to rush like mad. I have not had the luxury of playing for 5 years to grind this title, and good lord, I am happy it's staying, however it's staying.

<br />
<br />
As someone who has done enough of the grinds to know exactly how &quot;difficult&quot; this is, I refute this.<br />
<br />
Whether you grind for PBD's, Shards, Librams, Inscription mats and Heavy Junkboxes or simply grind enough gold to buy these things, the effort required is pretty similar. WoW has a free market economy, driven by supply and demand. If it was easier to farm these things than buy them, then more people needing them would farm them, reducing demand, others would farm them to sell, increasing supply, and therefore price would come down, until the effort was equal. Conversely, if it was easier to make money than to farm these things, the people selling them would switch to doing something more productive with their time, reducing supply, while people wanting them would farm less, increasing demand, thus upping the price.<br />
<br />
There are some elements of this achievement that cannot be bought:<br />
<br />
Farming Blood of Heroes, Skins of Shadow, Frayed Abomination Stitchings ~ 15-20 Hours<br />
Steamwheedle Rep ~ 20-30 hours<br />
Bloodsail Rep ~ 5-7 hours<br />
Painful Turnins (Ravendholdt, Shen'dralar) ~ depends on whether you have a mobile mailbox, but with an Argent gruntling expect to waste a few hours on each of these.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, some parts of the rep grind just make more sense to grind for rather than buy:<br />
<br />
Farming Syndicate Mobs ~ 5 hours<br />
<br />
<br />
Lastly, scanning the AH for darkmoon cards every day for 6 months, even at 5 minutes a day, adds up to 15 hours and that is a very conservative estimate (you can easily spend twice that per day if you include time spent logging to your alt, running between the AH and mailbox, and then managing your vast card collection). <br />
<br />
Ultimately though it is pretty much irrelevant though because even if you save time by spending gold, it takes time to make gold. The cards you need to get DMF to exalted could cost you over 60K gold. That is not a trivial amount of cash to obtain, and because of the way inflation works in the game, the easier it gets to earn gold, the more expensive the cards become, so the time requirement for farming the gold stays constant. The same applies to Junkboxes, Librams and PBD's.<br />
<br />
Yes, Shen'dralar was a big chunk (about 3/8) of the Insane, but in the end its constituent parts are no more difficult than any of the other grinds.</div></div><hr />

I hated the DMF-Grind, because on my server Cards go for 100-400 gold a piece. This means simply buying cards would 90k-380k Gold. That's not the kind of money I have, so imagine farming the tree mobs in Skettis for weeks nearly nonstop: Kill 4 Mobs, wait 5 Minutes, kill 4 Mobs, wait 5 Minutes. I truly and deeply hated it.</div></div><hr />

I still knew that Blizzard always tries to be sneaky about these sort of stuff so I put in extra effort in the last two factions I had to grind, Ravenholdt manor and the Darkmoon faire when they announced that flying over the oldworld and dungeon changes would be top priority. I got the title just a few months ago.So this change doesn't affect me in any way whatsoever. <br />
<br />
What does bother me is the way they handled it, it is sloppy and underhanded and in complete disregard for the playerbase that is usually quiet and reserved about gameplay changes. Stuff happens and we know and accept it.<br />
What I for myself do not accept is that they remove content that was barely accessable for anyone ( 100% droprates on mimirons head and invincible ) and limit content that had always been accessible , the insane achievement and the class quests for example. Or to add further insult to injury, make said feature easier to get like the removal of the Shendralar and justicar/conqueror achievements for the battlemaster title.<br />
The whole point of the insane title is that you bothered to spent time, game currency and dedication to maximize friendship with a faction that has no benefit at all. Hence INSANE.... It never was meant to show 'time well spend' it is an ironic statement to the player himself, the playerbase and the company Blizzard. <br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't tell us whom they are aiming to please with this change but I am sure of it that it isn't for the more intelligent type.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc923685b14c</div><div class="date">2010-11-12, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't exaggerate here, some people claim the DMF component has taken them longer then Shen'dralar. And NO ONE farms DM ONLY until they hit exalted. They would actually spend most of their money, upwards to around 35 - 100k gold to complete it, just like DMF. It's almost as if your saying this achievement will be a cakewalk now. Why don't you actually try and do the achievement after the changes are made and when you finally complete it, you go tell me it was easy... Otherwise you're just trollin.<br />
<br />
Not planning to do it again just to prove a point. Done it without spending more than 1k gold to pick up a couple of odd PBDs I was missing towards the end.<br />
<br />
I won't disagree - DMF takes a long time regardless of the method you choose to complete it, be it buying the cards from AH as they are not always there or the prices are just ridiculous, or if you decide to farm the Skettis trees like I did. And I'm not trying to trivialize the other parts of the achievement. Each and every one of those grinds was a pain in some way. But in my opinion Shen'dralar was the most complex of them all, and having it removed from the requirements is a slap in the face for the people who truly committed to obtaining the title. <br />
<br />
Here's an idea... keep the FoS with the limited requirements, but don't let it grant the title anymore. Like Hand of A'dal or Scarab Lord... sure you can complete the quest line but you don't get the title, because that party is over.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maeby</div><div class="date">2010-11-12, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The unfortunate reality is, when it was announced that the Insane title would be removed, Blizzard got a ton of responses from people who would have never actually gone for the Title anyway, but jumped on the bandwagon just in case they ever get a wild hair. The people who are hurt by this most recent development are much fewer in numbers than the players out there that are lazy, but love to find a reason to whine. <br />
<br />
Even though the latest announcement is a much crueler decision than it would have been to remove the Title, we probably don't have the numbers to compete with the whiners for action from Blizzard. Blizzard, you are taking care of the wrong players in this case. We may be a smaller group, but by completing the achievement in the past, we have already shown that we are more dedicated to this issue than those who haven't bothered.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Angifuhz</div><div class="date">2010-11-14, 12:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two things, regarding this Feat, that were stated by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
1.Just for clarity, Insane in the Membrane will not be removed in Cataclysm. We can only confirm this one for you, but since it's undoubtedly one of the most brain-melting achievements, we thought it nice to let you know that you don't have to rush to have this done before the expansion. ;)<br />
2. Insane in the Membrane is a feat of strength, not an achievement. Feats are things that you can't be guaranteed to complete, which is why they're feats and not achievements. Most of them are actually now impossible to complete, and this feat will join a long list of &quot;you had to be there&quot; moments in WoW time. <br />
<br />
The feat isn't being removed of course, those who have it will retain it, however; some of the requirements are, so it will no longer be able to be completed by anyone who has not already done so. <br />
<br />
It's possible that in some very specific situations where someone has completed the reputations which are being removed, but not others that will still be in the game, that it can still be completed. But it's something we're waiting for clarity on, and will let you know as soon as we do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those things being said...<br />
As one of the few who got this, I find it aggrivating that Blizzard decided to simply remove a reputation from the requirement, thus making it less time consuming/costly to complete. The Feat has been around since *at least* the begining of Wrath, which was 2 years ago today. People have had ample time to get it done, but with the threat of it becoming unobtainable, there has been a huge outcry. Granted, Blizzard did in fact state the Feat wasn't being changed/removed so no one needed to feel rushed. For whatever reason, they changed their mind, which is rather common, and the Feat was to be put in a glass display case along with the rest of the Feats that are done and gone, ie. Amani War Bear, Brewfest Steins, WoW Anniversaries, Collector's Edition pets, etc. Rightfully so - it's a very special and rare thing that should not be around forever.<br />
<br />
For those who have already obtained their title or at least finished the Shen'dralar part of it are basically getting a kick in the teeth with this change. To try and compensate, Blizzard wants to give us a 'consolation' prize of another Feat specifically for getting Exhalted with those odd elves... maybe. Oh goody. Regarding those who had the 'rug pulled out from under them', so to speak, again... you had more than enough time to get it done. Personally, I'm an avid pet and mount collector, so when I learned that the ZG mounts are going away, I simply started to farm more. If they drop for me, awesome. If not, oh well.<br />
<br />
At this point, it's about the principle and maybe some bragging rights. I mean, I got the Loremaster title before it was nerfed - less quests are required now. When I see someone else rockin' Loremaster that they just got, kudos to them... but a small part of me thinks, &quot;I got it when it harder.&quot; Pardon the elitism - part of the WOOHOO! factor comes from doing things before they're softened up, when they really mean something - that goes for anything really, out in the real world or otherwise. Yay for pride and competition in a game! As I said, principle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. To me, a title like &quot;of the Shen'dralar&quot; would be quite pointless. Even nerfed, the new Insane in the Membrane is still more of an accomplishment than Shen'dralar alone, so I would never display my Shen'dralar title. Having 2 insane titles seems the right way to go:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Insane: For getting it without Shen'dralar<br />
The Clinically Insane: For those with both the Insane and Shen'dralar</div></div><hr />

I am in a similar position. I believe there is strong possibility that you will now need Bloodsail Exalted instead of just honored. To be perfectly honest though it makes zero difference to someone like me. If Bloodsail Buccaneers exalted is now a realistic possibility I'll still do it regardless of whether I need it for the insane or not.<br />
<br />
The Steamwheedle and Bloodsail rep grinds combined were only about 1/8 of the total insane grind to start with anyway so in the grand scheme of things, I don't think this is really a &quot;big&quot; problem at all. I think most of the insane folks out there would happily trade another 20 hours of grinding for Steamwheedle rep in exchange for being able to get another exalted reputation done.</div></div><hr />

It has never been required to have ALL reps at their required level at the same time. So long as you had Steamwheedle at exalted at one time, it should still count towards the FoS. If you're like me and want as many exalted reps as you can get, then that's the only reason you'd need to bother getting it back up to exalted.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lorimeyers</div><div class="date">2010-11-16, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After spending so much time (and gold) to get the Insane title on my main, I'm really bummed out that they are making it easier for people now. I think the Shen'dralar was one of the most expensive reps for me to grind (PBD's cost about 250g on my server and the librams were going for around 200g each). I also did my fair share of grinding for them too.<br />
<br />
My only hope is that it's a title worth wearing (if there even is a title). Before I even knew what went into the Insane title, I saw someone with it, and I instantly &quot;had to have it&quot; and the research and the process started for me. I want the Shen'dralar FoS to be equally desirable so that everyone else that doesn't have it, has something to be envious of. A special mount would be an awesome reward too. Something to parade around with that causes people to wonder &quot;how did you get that [title/mount]? Tabards are lame ... no one notices them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Scarab Lord&quot; isn't obtainable anymore, despite the number of people complaining, and that was a 10 hour window to get that title. People have had almost 2 years to get this one, and now they complain 'cause they didn't do it in time, and Blizz caves to their QQ'ing and makes it all better for them. <br />
<br />
The ZG mounts are going away. I never spent real time/efforts to get these, and I'm jealous of those that have these mount. But most of them actually put in effort. It's my loss and I understand that. If I complain enough, will they create some way where it will be all-of-sudden really easy for me to get these mounts? That's what they are doing here with the Insane title.<br />
<br />
It's a FoS for a reason. Just because you didn't bother with it until it was &quot;too late&quot; to get it done, doesn't mean it should be handed over to you with ease.</div></div><hr />
