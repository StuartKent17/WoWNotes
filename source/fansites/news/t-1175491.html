Who cares about what you think? I'm comparing the staff others classes got to shamans.<br />
<br />
Druids:<br />
- Glyph to change their travel form into a stag, 2 player mount<br />
- several new looks for their other forms<br />
- probably some more..<br />
<br />
Mages:<br />
- Illusion spell, ability to turn into nearly every NPC/PC in game<br />
- 6 different polymorph forms<br />
- fun glyph to change your Portal: Dalaran to port people to Dalaran Crater<br />
- probably many more..<br />
<br />
.......<br />
....<br />
..<br />
<br />
Shamans:<br />
- Arctic wolf glyph, different skin, same polygon count and same animation as they were 8 years ago<br />
- A glyph that adds placeholders of inactive totems<br />
<br />
No, turning into an Ascandant(?) for 10 seconds is not a fun ability.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely, if i charge twice withing a few seconds, im screwed for the next 20seconds THEN I get 1 charge back and have to wait another 20sec.<br />
<br />
In wotlk you had charge on a 20second cd, and intercept on 25seconds.<br />
<br />
I could charge and intercept then have both ready at nearly the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just to clarify, the new charge works like DK runes. If you use 2 runes, they both come off CD near each other. If you use both charge charges, same thing. <br />
<br />
Use charge 1 at 0 sec and charge 2 at 10 sec, you'll get charge 3 at 20 sec and charge 4 at 30 sec.<br />
Use charge 1 at 0 and charge 2 at 3, and you'll get charge 3 at 20 and charge 4 at 23.</div></div><hr />

No. If you charge second time after 3 sec (as example) then you get 1 charge back after 20 sec from first use, and second charge after 20 sec from second use (23 from first in this example).</div></div><hr />

Sorry to say but your logic is wrong. They reworked Double Time to work like Roll for monks. Each cooldown of charge is independent of each other. Example: You use one Charge, its CD begins and you use your second Charge five seconds later. By the time the first Charge's CD has finished (20 seconds after it was used) you will have five seconds until the second one is available.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just tried it on the beta, seems you're correct. The second cooldown for Charge does not begin until the first one finishes. I'm hoping this is a bug, in all honesty.</div></div><hr />

It may not look like much on paper, but the Priest changes are HUGE. Cannot be understated. 10% off of everything you do. Imagine if Sinister strike cost 10 less energy. Or if Heroic strike cost 10 less Rage. Its pretty big.</div></div><hr />

The 2 charges should reset once its hit 20seconds, why is this a &quot;good&quot; talent? We used to have charge+intercept from vanilla to 4.0.6 or w/e they nerfed juggernaut, WOW what a talent!<br />
<br />
Should be: You can now charge twice within a 20second window, or replace it with intercept(make intercept share cd with leap) or something, I want double charge with separate cds.<br />
<br />
Im so disappointed in the warrior changes..<br />
<br />
You do realise that this is probably the best they can do for balance? Your idea would make the other top tier talents obsolete.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry to say but your logic is wrong. They reworked Double Time to work like Roll for monks. Each cooldown of charge is independent of each other. Example: You use one Charge, its CD begins and you use your second Charge five seconds later. By the time the first Charge's CD has finished (20 seconds after it was used) you will have five seconds until the second one is available.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just tried it on the beta, seems you're correct. The second cooldown for Charge does not begin until the first one finishes. I'm hoping this is a bug, in all honesty.<br />
<br />
Yes that does seem like a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
does that mean that getting a shoulder enchant without inscription will not be possible in light of the recent changes blizzard made with head and should enchants?<br />
<br />
Yes, If your server has 0 inscriptionists then no one has shoulder enchants. If there is one with mop level scribing then you all can have one (for a fee).<br />
<br />
Might be that epic ones are Profession specific and Blues for all. Since it has always been your profession special thing. (Like wrist enchas for LW:s)</div></div><hr />

There is 3 enchants in WoWDB - Blue (Lesser), Epic (Great) and profession specific epic (Secret). It seems first two is what you will buy on AH, and last is profession bonus.</div></div><hr />

As a rogue myself, I don't feel the need for a ton of changes. We play pretty well, and I top our dps meter in raid routinely.<br />

Keep in mind too, that this is the expansion of Everything Tanking Changes, much like Cata was Everything Healing Changes.<br />

<br />
You got it all wrong. Each time you use Charge, there is a 20 second cooldown on THAT Charge, so the 2 uses of Charge you have have separate cooldowns, which actually makes this talent REALLY good because you can effectively Charge every 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Charge - 10 sec - Charge - 10 sec (first is now reset) - Charge - 10 sec (second use is now reset) - Charge<br />
<br />
This is the best talent in the first tier now, depending on if you use it correctly otherwise you're stuck with a longer cooldown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Read it again.. it's says EPIC shoulder enchants.. There are still other BOE shoulder enchants. This is probably just referring to scribe only shoulder enchants.. If I remember correctly the originals were just BOP and didn't have the typical &quot;requires inscription 600&quot; on them. I imagine they have been changed to keep people from leveling inscription, making the highest enchant, then dumping the profession. Just an oversight on their part and is now properly fixed. However, I have not been back on beta to check this out.</div></div><hr />

Even more reasons why not to bring a restoration shaman.<br />
<br />
Monks can spam an aoe that jumps all over the place. Sure it is weaker, but it is instant cast and all day long the wave will ride the group.<br />
<br />
Not to mention how OP this will be in PvP. Everyone stack, 20 yard range set, spam instant cast that cant be interrupted that heals everyone.<br />
<br />
Also, the only time shamans seem to pop up is some kind of tweaking, usually in the downward slope. Shamans can be happy or lucky right now that they haven't touched the only CD dps they have that actually is a CD dps/hps ability: Ascendance. But time will tell, I predict it to be nerfed and MoP will be the anti-shaman expansion, just like every other expansion has been at the start. Shamans are usually OK at the end of each expansion, but who wants to wait 1-2 year to play a class?</div></div><hr />

I remain pretty underwhelmed as a Resto Shaman. I REALLY do not get why they can't add a new spell, on the same CD as Healing Rain, that is like a weaker, 30y ranged Healing-Rain-Starfall-eque spell. It would be perfect imo.</div></div><hr />

So you Vengeance climbs and climbs and climbs for 20 sec, and then resets? or the 20 sec is set for the duration that you vengeance can climb, and then it will sit idle at the max level it reached in the durated time?</div></div><hr />

It may have changed....but if I recall, Ghostcrawler had a post explaining Vengeance changes that stated the 20 seconds is a rolling buff. So every second it looks twenty seconds back in time and calculates how much damage came in, and then constantly updates the buff accordingly. (The &quot;every second&quot; but was just a number made up to explain the point...I don't know how often it actually updates it's 20 second lookback.)</div></div><hr />
