Probably never. They'll just ignore it like they have been doing since the start of the xpac. Dead faction leaders in loading screens. So what?<br />
<br />
Well, that's my bet anyways: come BfA we will still have the same old EK/Kalimdor loading screens :p</div></div><hr />

Don't know how you think WoW's main player base is &quot;a bunch of kids&quot;. I started playing WoW when I was 18 (14 years ago), and honestly most people I encounter ingame are over 25 going 30 as the average even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly... Not sure what you're trying to say here lol<br />
<br />
I simply explained what T for teen means. A 13 year old can go out and buy wow without a parent, a 12 year old cannot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW's medium age of its players was always adult. 20-35 or something.<br />
<br />
And tbf, I think they should go all out on creepy stuff! :D<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
What do all those zebras mean...? Could we hope for a model update to ALL horses/zhevra-style mounts in the game?<br />
Love that &quot;Evil&quot; horse too.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
WTF is up with that Alpacas animations. I can't work out what model they based it on - Almost looks like it's running like a monkey. Looks incredibly un-Alpaca-like<br />
<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
The walk is clearly from the Camel mounts.<br />
The run looks to be unique for this, it actually looks rather accurate to how an Alpaca skip-run IRL. The model seems to have quite a lot of unique animations made with real life Alpacas in mind.<br />
<br />
Watching the death animation broke my heart. <br />

<br />
The option always existed, changing wording of it really doesn't indicate much of anything. And it only refers to character models, and even then only a subset since some races cannot use their old models anymore.<br />
<br />
For the &quot;MC&quot; models - they are probably putting them in some new content and since it fits they replaced old versions of them as well. They have done this in the past whenever appropriate - ie. when they needed a new version of some mob type that already existed, they just replaced all of them instead of introducing a new one only.<br />
<br />
The elementals are really just the new void walker model re-colored though, and the flamewalker is as you pointed out also a re-used model.</div></div><hr />

Deny them the purchase or have their parent come with them o.o...<br />

If I really have to play the full war campaign to unlock Mag'har orcs I don't play the expac. Mag'har and Zandalar were the main reasons to give Blizzard another chance with the game, because the other thing I'm interested in (PvP) is in a lousy state. If I really have to level 1 character through BfA and to 120 to unlock Mag'har (which I have to level again - and a Zandalar later too) I'm not playing. <br />
If the game hasn't enough content that you need to stretch it like that I'm not the customer you want.</div></div><hr />
