In the upcoming pre-Warlords of Draenor content patch, we’re adding a new feature that allows players to undelete characters. But before you delete that character, there are a few limitations we want you to let you to know about first.<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters under level 10 and Death Knights at level 55 are not eligible to be undeleted.<br />
Characters between level 10 and level 29 will no longer recoverable after 90 days.<br />
Characters between level 30 and 49 will no longer recoverable after 120 days.<br />
All other characters level 50 and above are eligible to be undeleted at any time.<br />
Please keep in mind you will only be able to use the undelete option once every 30 days.<br />
<br />
<br />
Undeleting a character restores all of its enchantments, gems, and items fully intact. You’ll be able to get back into action right away, and your character won’t remember being deleted—we won’t tell, either.<br />
<br />
Shhhh. . . .<br />

Reclaiming Your Name: What About Flugur?<br />
We’ll be holding deleted character names for a limited time, and the original creator can reclaim it for use on a new character during that time. If you create a new character with the same name as one of your deleted characters (let’s say Flugur), the new character must be renamed, transferred, or deleted to complete the restoration of the original Flugur.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt it. GM's are still needed to handle the huge volume of in-game requests. This just streamlines it so they can get to the more important trouble issues instead of wasting time with character restorations.</div></div><hr />

I deleted a Rogue many years ago and when I came back started a new one because I didn't realize you could undelete him. I've always thought about undeleting him as well as a warrior I deleted.</div></div><hr />

Character Restorations have always worked like this. Characters above 50 have always been kept, you just don't need to go through a GM now.</div></div><hr />

This is something that already has a system in place for use by GMs, this is just giving the users a button to access it themselves. <br />

<br />
But that name is reserved to your account for I think 30 days or something like that. So you would have to delete your char, wait one month or so, let your friend make a toon with the old name and then undelete your character. That would probably work but you'd have to wait a long time to play your char again.</div></div><hr />

It works currently without this new feature. Trust me i have done it a few times now and i know i am not the only one here who has. They will always restore a deleted toon if you make a ticket right away.<br />
<br />
Loads of people do it without even noticing it. Like transferring the name of a main to an alt. Instead of paying for 2 name changes you pay for only 1. The GM's actually tell you delete your main then pay for a name change on alt. Then they restore main and because your alt now has the name you change it for free.. 1 name change for price of 2 recommended technique from a GM.</div></div><hr />

Loads of people do it without even noticing it. Like transferring the name of a main to an alt. Instead of paying for 2 name changes you pay for only 1. The GM's actually tell you delete your main then pay for a name change on alt. Then they restore main and because your alt now has the name you change it for free.. 1 name change for price of 2 recommended technique from a GM.<br />

So how long? If the characters names aren't held indefinitely, then other people could potentially take that name. Which means the &quot;free name change&quot; could work, it would just require you to wait out until the name is freed up and then have your friend take it for you.</div></div><hr />

That wouldn't make any sense. Any character above 50+, even if deleted, would be hogging names and not allowing other players to take those names... indefinitely.

It wouldn't make sense if the names were to be held indefinitely. What if you want to delete a character because your friend wanted to have that name? In this case, if your character is above 50, your friend would never be able to take it. That is much worse than holding names on inactive accounts.</div></div><hr />

I must have got the same GM because I deleted a level 85 warrior at the end of Cata (I had 3 85 warriors) to make room for a monk and decided to make the monk on my main account. When I requested a restoration I was told it was too long ago to recover. It had been maybe 3 months.</div></div><hr />

Character Restoration is already a thing. Basically allows you to retrieve deleted items, most especially for hacked characters, but also for some specific quest rewards too. So undeleting a character would be a different process and need a different term to associate with it.</div></div><hr />

Well that would be because someone petitioned a GM to have the name freed. I can tell you from personal experience however that it takes longer than 60 days for it to be freed from your account once deleting. My son wanted a name that he had given a character on my account many years ago and after petitions at the 30 day and 60 day mark it still was not eligible to be freed. It was at that point he decided to just stick with the new name.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, there are a lot of things that is a waste of dev-time and resources, but not this. Many Tickets are about things that can be automatically done, for example restoring a deleted character.

It seems to be a waste of dev time and resources.<br />
<br />
That's quite a short-sighted outlook. I mean, unless you think that this takes the same amount of time/resources that actual game content such as instances take. <br />
There's a very good chance that this feature alone could have been added by one or two people, no chance that it took an entire team.<br />
<br />
Also, you seem to forget that WoW's dev team is the largest it's ever been now.</div></div><hr />

Premades have been on beta since it started...Just because it's on beta doesn't mean it will make it live. There is tons of features that are beta only. This is a comfirmation that the undelete feature we currently have on beta will work for live as well.</div></div><hr />

If I delete Flugur, someone else makes a character named Flugur and I recover mine, they'll have to change their name? So when creating a new character you're never really sure whether that name won't be taken?<br />
<br />
If they incorporated a failsafe for this then simply delete Flugur, let someone else make a Flugur and restore your character, after which your character should (in my eyes) be eligible for a name change.<br />

good Ill go put my gold on a lvl 80 I no longer play delete them so the gold farmers cant steal meh gold come back and undelete them later....</div></div><hr />

That's a massive amount of storage space used on something that is otherwise only in the most extreme rare of cases going to be asked for again.<br />
<br />
Character info is not all that complicated really. <br />
<br />
Imagine a small text file; line 1 is a number referring to race, line 2 a number referring to gender, line 3 to face, line 4 hair, all the way down to item IDs of all your gear and enchants and gems, talent choices, quest IDs completed, achievement IDs completed, etc etc etc. You end up with a pretty tiny file that pretty much makes up everything about your character. Multiplied times millions it's still nothing to keep it stored.<br />
<br />
I don't know if this is how Blizzard does it, but you get the idea. Someone pushes delete and one of these tiny txt files gets automatically generated and tucked away, easily found by a database program later.</div></div><hr />

This feature goes hand in hand with the character name wipe, so people would log in to save their name, and undelete a character to save that too.<br />

We’ll be holding deleted character names for a limited time, and the original creator can reclaim it for use on a new character during that time. If you create a new character with the same name as one of your deleted characters (let’s say Flugur), the new character must be renamed, transferred, or deleted to complete the restoration of the original Flugur. <br />
<br />
So i delete a char, make a new one with its name<br />
Then Undelete a char and have a free name change waiting??</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. From the post it sounds like if you create a new character with the same name as the deleted character, you won't be able to undelete until you rename or move the new character (and pay for it). So it won't be possible to abuse this for free renames.<br />
<br />
You won't be able to get free rename with a friend's help either, because the deleted character's name will be reserved for a while (unspecified amount of time) - only on your own account you will be able to claim this reserved name.</div></div><hr />

With all these things generally done by GMs being streamlined into character services, I anticipate another wave of lay-offs to their customer service department here soon.<br />
<br />
Not necessarily. From a pure business perspective, you should always go for automation when possible as computers are cheaper than people. If there's a rigid ruleset like &quot;once per 30 days, characters conditionally available depending on level&quot;, that's something you might as well hard-code and let the player press the button. Right now, single-instruction jobs like &quot;sew a pattern&quot; or &quot;assemble a car&quot; are getting replaced entirely by computers, but since GM's have such a heavy and diverse workload that pretty much always requires human interaction (for which we don't have nearly as good AI yet compared to car assembly), decreasing their numbers isn't the only way to create value. Shifting some of that over to automation so they can answer a higher number of meaningful tickets can also have prospective value, by making service faster.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: Buissnessese for &quot;faster tickets, happier customers&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I bet you can't since the feature will probably cold-start when the patch goes live. It's highly unlikely that Blizzard fills the restoration manually with all old characters for every account.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crowbarker</div><div class="date">2014-09-26, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">1. The idea of anyone complaining about this is ridiculous. This is the expansion is filled with &quot;Quality of Life&quot; features for WoW and this is just another one of those features. <br />
<br />
2. It is a fair way for the server space to be freed up by deleting old toons without pissing people off. They are literally giving players a great opportunity to restore their characters in an easy manner. After a certain amount of time, they will delete those characters, as noted above, leaving more space for Blizzard to use on their own servers.<br />
<br />
3. Customer service is not in trouble, nor is Blizzard. If anything, this shows that Blizzard is willing to go that extra mile for their suscribers. Blizzard Customer Service probably gets a lot of inquiries about restoring toons. It is less hassle for the GM's now, which obviously makes things easier to deal with customer inquiries at the corporate office, thus making day-to-day operations run smoother.<br />
<br />
In summary, why anyone would sit there and think that this is a bad thing and that Blizzard is in trouble is absolutely beyond me and it benefits Blizzard more than us.</div></div><hr />
