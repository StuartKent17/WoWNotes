Weekly Bonus Event - Battlegrounds<br />
A new weekly quest and rewards are here—steel yourself for Battleground combat!<br />
<br />
Seven Days on the Battlegrounds<br />
All this week, heading to the Battlegrounds will net you some extra Honor along with bonus loot for completing this week’s quest. To enter the fray, open Group Finder (default hotkey: I) and then select the Player vs. Player tab. Next choose Casual, select Random Battlegrounds, and hit the Join Battle button—you’ll be matched up with other players and sent to one of the 11 battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Weekly Quest<br />
Before you get started, your adventure guide has a quest for you (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53036-a-call-to-battle). Win four random Battlegrounds, and you’ll be rewarded with 5 Marks of Honor and 750 Azerite Power.<br />
<br />
Battleground Buff<br />
This week you gain 50% more Honor in Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
A New Event Every Week<br />
The Bonus Events system consists of a rotating schedule of different activities, currently scheduled to run each week beginning on Tuesdays. Each Bonus Event grants a passive bonus to a particular game activity and offers a once-per-event quest with a noteworthy reward for accomplishing a related goal. The in-game calendar can serve as your one-stop reference for the event schedule. The Adventure Guide also offers a direct link to active Bonus Events, allowing you to easily accept any associated quests.<br />

How are these worthless weekly events still a thing?<br />
<br />
Because player engagement (aka data they have access to) &gt; your personal feels?</div></div><hr />

OR... <br />
<br />
Put rewards on activities so more players join in? <br />
<br />
E v e r y t h I n g has to have a reward these days. **guaranteed**Rewards=more players.</div></div><hr />

Wow people these days seem to bitch about everything the game does. Those are some minor rewards you can receive for doing content you might do anyway. Nobody gets hurt if they misses them, nobody gets a big advantage if they claim them.<br />
<br />
If those weekly rewards are really triggering you guys this hard, chances are you should've left this game and this site long ago. But I'm guessing you guys need a place to lurk and release your anger.</div></div><hr />

Fact of the matter is that the game never needed this before, and now it does. <br />
<br />

<br />
Nowadays honor is not currency, it's experience for account-wide PVP levels - on certain levels there are cosmetic rewards, but grind is looong. So events like this are great thing, especially in 8.2 with essence that require you to farm X honor.</div></div><hr />
