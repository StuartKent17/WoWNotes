They did say that there is going to be a new RAF mount and this is good timing since the expansion has been out for a while and with the new heirloom system people may want to start second accounts.</div></div><hr />

They would never make a teaser for that.<br />
It's obvious it's a cash-shop mount.</div></div><hr />

cause people dislike paying $15 for a sub and being nickled and dimed for stuff that should be in the game?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kornek21</div><div class="date">2015-01-28, 08:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cause people dislike paying $15 for a sub and being nickled and dimed for stuff that should be in the game?<br />
<br />
then dont buy it...easy as that, im a vanilla beta vet and i still find this very good business, if you dont want the mount then dont buy it, if the sub is too much for you then dont sub and find another game, alot of F2P games out there mimicing WoW.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snurgle</div><div class="date">2015-01-28, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">cause people dislike paying $15 for a sub and being nickled and dimed for stuff that should be in the game?<br />
<br />
Irrelevant though. It's 'optional'. You don't want to pay for anything because you pay a sub, then don't. Pretty simple. Some people, like myself, have a few rare mounts but simply don't have the time to go for every single nice mount. So having a nice one every now and then in store is fantastic. But the key here again is: Optional. Also, this won't make you OP in game. You're not buying epic gear. Just saying.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for paying for something when you're paying a sub - Have you seen the state of the game industry? From DLC to Pay-To-Win, this stuff is literally everywhere. Blizzard is actually one of the lesser evils... unless someone is rage-playing, paying their sub monthly, yet still playing every single day while complaining on X forums. You know the type. Those people are silly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kezotar</div><div class="date">2015-01-28, 08:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not that people dislike Cash Shop. But what they dislike is that as soon as they're releasing a new pet/mount they suddenly have shitloads of time for it. While releasing content, balancing the game, and actually fixing bugs? Nah, they don't have time for that. Even though everyone pays their tag.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind shit if they actually added new stuff to everyone else aswell, or at least achievable via some sort of stuff, or they actually managed their game. But just saying &quot;Oh we don't have time for this and that, because we're short on staff and that it would take too much time&quot; and then adding a few mounts on the store and pets.. Lame.</div></div><hr />

OK...<br />
<br />
So just out of intrest all the changes in 6.1 compared to making 1 mount.<br />
<br />
What do you think took more time?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pilfer</div><div class="date">2015-01-28, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">it's the lvl 1 usable mount from collecting all heirlooms you nobheads<br />
<br />
<br />
It is a little ridiculous to call people &quot;nobheads' when it is already been stated that the Heirloom mount is a Chauffeured mount. This mount is not Chauffeured. Additionally, this mount is not &quot;universal&quot; enough to be a heirloom mount intended to be used by all races and classes.<br />
<br />
It is transparently obvious that this is not the heirloom mount. Most obviously because there is no chauffeur or place for one.<br />
<br />
I think it will likely be a RAF mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're pissed why? Because you'd be boning the Alliance again if you gave a super unique ravager mount to Horde only via Laughing Skull, why they get fucked with shitty elephants again.<br />

Okay, it's in-game. It's Mythic only low drop rate from Blackhand.<br />
<br />
Happy? 1% of the players have it now.<br />

What do you think took more time?<br />
<br />
What did they do on the patch? Most of it was included in the Expansion cost. I mean, we're expected all that shit with it.<br />
And they didn't actually do anything to PvP, check the notes.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I reconsidered my guess after realizing that it was not &quot;universal&quot; enough to be a RAF mount either.<br />

Hearthsteed was datamined long before it was ever used.<br />

My thoughts were it could be something linked to a purchase of something like say the hots &quot;founders pack&quot; / similar option further down the line or for playing/winning x number of games of hots.<br />

They did it with hearthstone and that's proved a big success, they'd be stupid NOT to use their biggest ip to help push another one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course they won't. My point is it is shady and immoral to have micro-transactions like this in a sub based game. If it was somehow obtainable through an achievement, rep, etc. and you could pay to bypass that requirement, sure why not, but to add something completely unobtainable to players who pay monthly is wrong. <br />
<br />
And adding salt to the wound, all of the pay mounts have so much more detail, and are for the most part overall better looking just shows the greed. &quot;Oh don't make that achievement mount look TOO badass, gotta make sure they still want to buy the pay mounts.&quot;</div></div><hr />

You don't want to pay for anything because you pay a sub, then don't. Pretty simple. Some people, like myself, have a few rare mounts but simply don't have the time to go for every single nice mount. So having a nice one every now and then in store is fantastic. But the key here again is: Optional. Also, this won't make you OP in game. You're not buying epic gear. Just saying.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for paying for something when you're paying a sub - Have you seen the state of the game industry? From DLC to Pay-To-Win, this stuff is literally everywhere. Blizzard is actually one of the lesser evils... unless someone is rage-playing, paying their sub monthly, yet still playing every single day while complaining on X forums. You know the type. Those people are silly.<br />

No idea what this has to do with a mount teaser. The same people who work in the PvP department do not create items, so whine somewhere else. Besides, WoW's PvP has ALWAYS been imbalanced since the beginning of the game. The dynamics of the class changes with each attempt at fixing it has just become a part of the game by now, and it kind of spices things up imo.<br />

That's not what reskin means... It's the same as any tiger mount, yes, but they remodeled the entire thing. A reskin would have simply been a fresh new coat of paint over the exact same mount. There's a lot of apparent work that went into this mount. Using existing skeletons and animations is normal.</div></div><hr />

But what they dislike is that as soon as they're releasing a new pet/mount they suddenly have shitloads of time for it. While releasing content, balancing the game, and actually fixing bugs? Nah, they don't have time for that. Even though everyone pays their tag.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind shit if they actually added new stuff to everyone else aswell, or at least achievable via some sort of stuff, or they actually managed their game. But just saying &quot;Oh we don't have time for this and that, because we're short on staff and that it would take too much time&quot; and then adding a few mounts on the store and pets.. Lame.<br />
<br />
A cash shop mount takes probably 1 artist a few weeks to make at most. Stop saying we are losing content because of this...</div></div><hr />

you're delusional or VERY optimistic if you think that. And even if you're right, that's still one artist and several weeks per mount/pet, not to mention the creation and maintenance of the store itself, gone, paid for by you and me, even though we gain nothing out of it. I don't understand how you can defend a store in a subscription based game that ALSO asks you pay for the game itself (expansions), especially since there have been not a single cool or awesome looking mount like they do in the store added to this game since, oh, forever. Instead we get boars on steroids in-game.</div></div><hr />

That is fun though, rare mounts are always fun. For example MoP ruined Invincible and Mimiron's Head. Like every 7th player that I come across has one of those now and thus it's not any fun to use them anymore. <br />

Hate the whole &quot;store mounts&quot; issue. Most of the people whining probably don't even farm mounts on multiple accounts. I run through most mount raids on three characters (which lets be honest, is nothing for some people) and I have no problem with store mounts.<br />
<br />
£20 is the cost of going to the cinema and getting some popcorn and a drink, a one time thing, whereas a mount you get to keep forever... (until the last blizzard server is switched off that is).<br />
<br />
Either way, the mount looks kind of pretty, but not sure I'd use it that much (or even buy it).</div></div><hr />

Tell me you aren't deluded and thinking that they have to get programmers to rebuild the store to add a new mount.<br />
<br />
<br />
there have been not a single cool or awesome looking mount like they do in the store added to this game since, oh, forever. <br />
<br />
Entirely subjective. Pandaren phoenixes, Azerothian Choppers, Cloud Serpents, Core hound, those killer PvP mounts, Sky Golem...<br />

I don't get why people buy store mounts. I mean obviously they are better designed and look way better than any mount in the game. But what satisfaction do you get from riding around on the same mount as everyone else? It instantly makes a &quot;Cool&quot; mount a royal piece of shit because everyone has one.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it, they don't advertise in game mounts. More likely they made this for the legendary questline, then said &quot;Fuck it&quot; and are going to put it on the store, because god knows if the mount isn't brown and ugly, it can't be in the game<br />

The store mount process<br />
<br />
1. New store mount<br />
2. Blizzard makes a fuck ton of money<br />
3. Idiots all realize they bought a mount everyone has<br />
4. you never see the mount again and people go back to using their favorites anyway<br />
<br />
Lemme ask, how many store mounts do you see a week after release? Almost 0, because the primary driving force in this game is looking cooler than other people. Leauge skins at least hold some status because to invest in a skin means (usually) you are skilled/like that specific character</div></div><hr />

But what satisfaction do you get from riding around on the same mount as everyone else? It instantly makes a &quot;Cool&quot; mount a royal piece of shit because everyone has one.<br />
<br />
Some of us play for our own sake, not for others. To me a cool mount is a cool mount regardless of how many people have it so your OPINION on the matter doesn't equal fact here.</div></div><hr />

Store mounts generally have more advanced effects like this too.<br />
<br />
They generally don't tease mounts earned in game on social media.<br />
<br />
They do tease RAF mounts &amp; CE Mounts aswell.</div></div><hr />

Spending money on a store mount, for one's own sake, is almost as pathetic as buying one because you think it makes you look cool.</div></div><hr />

There is no difference between CE mounts and ingame-shop mounts. In both cases you pay additional money just for some mount. I always laugh when people have every CE but badmouth ingame-shop buyers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;I don't have enough time to grind a cool mount&quot;<br />
<br />
Let's not forget a speed run of ICC takes like a half hour. But... your logic is about as sound, as the app FLOW, where you can pay 1.99 for &quot;hints&quot; that play the game for you. <br />
<br />
If ever there was a schmuck, it was the guy they convinced to pay money, on something they already pay money on.<br />

A cash shop mount takes probably 1 artist a few weeks to make at most. Stop saying we are losing content because of this...<br />
<br />
Yeah, I mean.. we have all these cool new brown recolored mounts to get. Like the brown clefthoof, or the brown hippo, or the brown wolf.</div></div><hr />

This is a subscrption after all, super fancy cosmetics are almost the only way F2P games make their money. Draenor mounts are pretty weak and this thing just confirms it. The Gronnling and Yeti seem to be the only unique rigs on offer in WoD, the others arn't necessarily poorly made (except the boars) but they are extremely dull and unimaginative. We went to Outland! Ofc there will be higher poly Elek, Talbuks and Clefthooves(i know they wern't mounts before) wheres the cool new s##t?<br />
<br />
This wasn't a problem in MoP, think of the cool mounts you could work towards, when you first arrived in pandaria. Sky serpents, waterstrider, cranes, shado pan tigers, crystal scorpion and jewel crafting panthers. Feelings of MoP aside, there may have been too many colour variations but the designs were unique.<br />
<br />
Not that it matters, someone from Blizz could punch many of your cats in the face and you would still blindly defend them. Which is both hilarious and tragic to read.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're a sheep. Take a look at the number of mounts that came out in MOP and what they looked like. <br />

Now take a look at the number of mounts that came out in WOD and what they looked like.<br />

Again, your opinions are not fact but I have to ask...you never spend money on stuff for yourself then? Since it's &quot;pathetic&quot; to spend money on stuff for oneself I mean...your logic fails, probably because you're mad over nothing. <br />
<br />
I don't consider it pathetic to play a game, buying additional goods around the game or spending lots of time getting stuff in-game or maybe just spending 1 hour a week on it as long as it makes the person happy. Making up ridiculous rules that don't make sense so that I can fly off the handle when others dare not to live by said rules ain't my thing. <br />

When this expansion ends - feel free to moan then if you think you have been hard done to. Store mounts are optional extras that in expansions way back you would never have seen! I dont have all store mounts because in my view some of them are crap - that my opinion.. however there are some bloody crackers and regardless if other people have them or not.. I will bloody buy it if I like it! Same way when I go into a shop and buy a pair of shoes.. If I think that I should get that optional extra Polish for my new shoes.. I will buy it. Its not rocket science is it? Its optional and its extra... and to be fair one of the best mounts in my opinion is the gronling or the yeti and it came with the expac! See whats happening here? I like different art/mounts than you! <br />
<br />
People need to stop thinking that Blizzard makes this game for 1 person and actually makes a game with millions of players - they cant please everyone! But it does make me smile watching some kiddies wanting the store mount, might not be able to afford it atm but moan like hell because of that factor and that blizzard are twats because they have no cash to afford an awesome looking mount.<br />

The thing is you are spending money on stuff that could be free if you would not spend money on it. In case you didn't notice, Blizz is ever increasing the stuff they sell on ingame shop. Pets, mounts, hats...cosmetics will be next for sure. You fuel that.<br />
<br />
And if I read that people want to support Blizz with that then I cringe. I mean what exactly did you support there during the last couple of years? New game developments like...uhm...Titan? Or do you think Hearthstone or the other copycats needed massive amounts of money? Addon releases in balancing beta stage like WoD or Diablo? Let's not forget that the next WoW addon will surely come sooner than the last one and not leave people without content for a year...which is a promise we heard for the 4th time? 5th time? Oh yeah...and they dealt with dead servers 3 years later than smaller companies did....smaller companies didn't earn money with paid server transfers tho.<br />
Your money is not making them do a better job. It just made them get fat and lazy.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see the money Blizz made just by screwing up the release of WoD. All those people from german servers like blackrock and aegwynn that had 10h connection queues and took a free transfers to some rather empty server(just to have connection queues there too then) and later pay for a transfer back to their old realm. That's likely millions just by FAILING....</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how can it be free when the game is pay to play...? The most LOGICAL conclusion would be that if no one bought these things, they wouldn't exist at all since the entire idea of it is to make more money which is what companies are about. Had people not spent money on the very first store pets and mounts, they would probably not have kept the store going NOR create more models for it that they'd then give out &quot;for free&quot; in-game. <br />
<br />
As for &quot;fueling&quot; it...yep, and I have a clean conscience too. Things I put high on my &quot;Do not support!!&quot;-list includes animal cruelty, child labour, slavery, horrible working conditions. Optional pixels for an additional fee made by a gaming company for use in their games simply ain't on that list of mine. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

And even if you're right, that's still one artist and several weeks per mount/pet, not to mention the creation and maintenance of the store itself, gone, paid for by you and me, even though we gain nothing out of it. I don't understand how you can defend a store in a subscription based game that ALSO asks you pay for the game itself (expansions), especially since there have been not a single cool or awesome looking mount like they do in the store added to this game since, oh, forever. Instead we get boars on steroids in-game.<br />
<br />
Because I can, and I don't need a reason why. I fundamentally don't have a problem with it at all. Sure new in game mounts would be nice, but for every store mount we get, we have 10 in game mounts. Whether they are up to the same quality is subjective. If you have a problem with it, either ignore it or quit. If you arent playing at all, I have no idea why you are even in this thread.</div></div><hr />

Entirely subjective. Pandaren phoenixes, Azerothian Choppers, Cloud Serpents, Core hound, those killer PvP mounts, Sky Golem...<br />
<br />
<br />

Pretty unlikely, the collectors edition rewards for Heart of the Swarm and Wings of Liberty were only pets. If anything I'd expect a mini-zealot.<br />
<br />
I agree. MoP had a ton of fantastic mounts. WoD mounts are good, but there could be a few more of them. WoD was just rushed out the door. I wont argue that. Still claiming that there have been no good in game mounts since store mounts became a thing is a fallacy.</div></div><hr />

The people crying that the store mounts are all better than the in-game mounts are usually also the first ones to say how lame the mounts are. Following their &quot;logic&quot; ain't easy since it stems from emotional outbursts.<br />
<br />
I have the store mounts tied to certain characters/classes/races, and still PLENTY of mounts that I love more thanks to how I obtained them or when or what they represent. But then again, these people don't think a mount is cool unless no one else has it so I think they're just in that mindset non stop be it store mounts or previously rare ones becoming more common.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your post is absolute nonsense and demonstrates a complete failure to understand how business works. <br />
<br />
NOTHING is done for free in business and thus NOTHING is given to us for free. They put just as much resources into developing features and content as revenue justifies. If revenue declines then resources for the continued production of aspects of the game will soon decline along with the declining revenue. <br />
<br />
That is how products die.<br />
<br />
These store mounts bring in a significant amount of revenue for Blizzard for relatively little production costs. That is HUGE for the future of the game. This revenue justifies continued resources and commitment to producing content for the game overall and maintaining consumer interest in WoW.<br />
<br />
Not having these elements would not result in more &quot;FREE&quot; stuff. It would simply result in less resources committed to producing &quot;stuff&quot; in the game in the long term. So without these mounts subscribers would get LESS for their $15 a month not more.<br />
<br />
And if you are not buying these mounts then you have absolutely no reason to complain. Because much or the profit from these mounts are used to produce additional content for the game overall. Content you are getting for your $15 per month. They spend thousands producing these store items and millions from selling them. So that massive revenue is used to increase the content you still get for $15. <br />
<br />
We are adding value to your game by buying these mounts not preventing you from getting &quot;free stuff&quot;. Stop whining.</div></div><hr />

I leave for work at 6:30am and don't get home till after 6pm, have 1.5 and 3.5 year old kids that I enjoy spending time with when I do get home. After the kids are in bed (~8:30pm), I usually do another hour or two of work or spend some time with my wife before going to bed at about ~11 (I'm up at 5:30). On the weekends, my wife works, and I do stuff with my kids. We have a social life, friends come over, we eat together. We do fun stuff outside and, you know, live life.<br />
<br />
I also enjoy Warcraft. I play 2-3 times a week for a couple hours after all is said and done. I enjoy running dungeons, leveling alts, hitting the odd raid. I'm a solid healer and have played since Vanilla. <br />
<br />
Farming, camping, working the AH to make gold to buy the expensive, nicer, mounts - simply no time for such things.<br />

If Blizzard wants to make something shiny so &quot;casual&quot; people like me can actually have a cool looking mount and still play the game how we want to, then fantastic. You don't have to buy it. No one has said you must. It does not wreck the economy of the game. It does nothing to improve anything for anyone. It does not make it worse either.

Lol, then why the fuck are you paying, if you want to pay the game, to get things in the game for you?<br />
<br />
Let's not forget that the rest of the WOD mounts are ugly brown blobs, and recolors. It's the worst xpack for mounts, we got, 5?<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with being &quot;Casual&quot; It's that you feel the need to buy mounts, to have blizzard.. play the game for you. Which is pointless. <br />
<br />
The mount could easily of been something like an inscription mount.<br />
<br />
and no, don't kid yourself, if you buy it... it isn't cool, no one thinks it's cool. It loses any and all &quot;Coolness&quot; because you didn't do anything for it. I can afford the mounts too, I am out at work from 6am till 6pm, but I have, ready? Integrity. I don't need a shiny mount to help me feel good about the fact that I can't raid. And that is why it is pathetic. Don't think just &quot;Hardcores&quot; don't like the store.<br />
<br />
In fact, instantly assuming I'm some shut in that spends hours a day on the game, makes you not only pathetic, but rude. I am... 2/7 Highmaul, and haven't been a hardcore raider since Wotlk, I just recognize that the heroic achievement mounts should look better than the shit you can buy in the store.</div></div><hr />

You wouldn't skip work and expect to be paid for it. And you wouldn't expect your kids to raise themselves if you didn't want to put in the effort. So, you shouldn't expect to get a mount just because you didn't want to make time to farm for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you people don't seem to understand. These mounts aren't special. Especially the recent ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fey dragon, and Skyscreamer, ravager? they weren't made special, they were made for WoD, then picked out of the list of mounts for in game, and put into the store. <br />
<br />
Say they make 8 mounts, they pick three pull them from the game, then sell them.<br />
<br />
That's why, unlike MoP, we have 5 unique mounts. only. 5.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure you also tailor your own cloth right? Because that's integrity, not buying clothes. You didn't do anything for it therefore it's not cool? Same could be said to the food you eat, the computer you play on... so on, so on.<br />

We don't even know yet for sure what will this mount will be for and you're already rambling about it and at random people because of their personal opinions.<br />

I haven't bought any store mount, because I don't feel it's worth the price to me.<br />
It's not replacing mounts earnable in-game that require harder achievements, most would probably not exist if they were not store mounts.<br />
And that's my opinion, I follow it myself but respect those who doesn't. It's their money, their choice.<br />
Why can't you do the same?<br />

You wouldn't skip work and expect to be paid for it. And you wouldn't expect your kids to raise themselves if you didn't want to put in the effort. So, you shouldn't expect to get a mount just because you didn't want to make time to farm for it.<br />
<br />
Do you expect to have food in your table if you don't grow/hunt it yourself? Or clothes in your closet if you don't tailor them yourself? Or games in your computer if you don't code them yourself?</div></div><hr />

<br />
NOTHING is done for free in business and thus NOTHING is given to us for free. They put just as much resources into developing features and content as revenue justifies. If revenue declines then resources for the continued production of aspects of the game will soon decline along with the declining revenue. <br />
<br />
That is how products die.<br />
<br />
These store mounts bring in a significant amount of revenue for Blizzard for relatively little production costs. That is HUGE for the future of the game. This revenue justifies continued resources and commitment to producing content for the game overall and maintaining consumer interest in WoW.<br />
<br />
Not having these elements would not result in more &quot;FREE&quot; stuff. It would simply result in less resources committed to producing &quot;stuff&quot; in the game in the long term. So without these mounts subscribers would get LESS for their $15 a month not more.<br />
<br />
And if you are not buying these mounts then you have absolutely no reason to complain. Because much or the profit from these mounts are used to produce additional content for the game overall. Content you are getting for your $15 per month. They spend thousands producing these store items and millions from selling them. So that massive revenue is used to increase the content you still get for $15. <br />
<br />
We are adding value to your game by buying these mounts not preventing you from getting &quot;free stuff&quot;. Stop whining.<br />
<br />
Yes, in a world where people have no interest in the survival of their business that is exactly how it would work. I think the managers at Blizz like their income and job tho...so they have an interest in keeping the game alive. You do not let your only permanent cash cow slowly fall apart...instead you invest more money and resources to produce incentives for the players to stay around. As long as the customers keep paying no matter what you do and you can press even more money out of them...there is no reason to not abuse that situation for your own benefits. <br />

The free market sucks when people have the mindset that companies need to be treated with care. In today's day and age, marketing is god and king, people won't wise up and understand that if no one bought store mounts, WoW wouldn't die, it would be forced to succeed. It's the systematic babying of corporations that makes the &quot;Free market&quot; not work. Aww you had bad sales? Here's a subsidy. <br />
<br />
If no one bought store mounts, they could do a few things, make the game cost more, up sub cost, or just make the game more attractive and increase it's market share. Which it would have to do anyway, because if anther game could give better content for less money, they would steal subs. Because you can't just set your game's price at whatever you like. I would say wow at best is between 40-60 dollars. if you made it, say 80? you wouldn't sell nearly as much. And I would say between 12-17 dollars for a sub. 20 would be far too high, no one would go that far<br />

Why do you buy store mounts, I'm curious.... Do you just like looking at it? There can't be any other reason. I just can't fathom how liking looking at something is worth 2 months of sub.<br />
<br />
You do need to understand some people buy them to &quot;look cool&quot; or &quot;Feel good about themselves&quot; which is kinda pathetic, that you need to spend 25 dollars to achieve that in a videah game. Ever get a rare mount? I can say safely when Ashes dropped for me, it was so much more satisfying than paying 25 extra dollars on my monthly bill would ever be.<br />
<br />
If you honestly don't do anything for the approval of others, you're a liar. Otherwise, join a nunhood, or the shaolin monks. wearing nice clothes &quot;Because you like dressing nice&quot; is a product of clever marketing, they define what is &quot;nice&quot;.<br />
<br />
In short, store mounts are the equivalent of wearing Crocs with sandals.<br />
<br />
<br />
The best part, the last three store mounts weren't even special. They were literally mounts they made for WoD then decided to sell instead. And I would bet this tiger was somehow Khadgar related. <br />
<br />
Fey dragon/ Ravager/ Skyscreamer. All taxis.. You payed for the equivalent of the gryphon mount from vanilla.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's why paying gold for the challenge mode sets are okay, but paying money for the sets, isn't okay.<br />
<br />
Except the game is not a &quot;mount collecting&quot; game. It's so much more than that. I'm sure for some people mounts are the most important thing in the game, but it's certainly not the focus of the game, nor is it advertised as such.<br />
<br />
Mounts are a bonus for many things, and important for collecionists, and yes, it sucks that there are real money exclusive mounts, with no way to earn them in-game. But that's no reason to lash out at the people who like or support them, just because you don't share their opinion. The ammount of mount stores compared to in-game mounts is still very low (less than 2% of in-game mounts are on the store), no need to make such a big deal. Vote with your wallet, and if you really want to influence what other do with their wallets, try to do it with reasoning, not bashing.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
How is spending money with a game for &quot;pixels&quot; any more ridiculous than spending time in said game farming for the same &quot;pixels&quot;? And just because people buy some store mounts it doesn't mean they don't also farm other mounts in-game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's not forget that the rest of the WOD mounts are ugly brown blobs, and recolors. It's the worst xpack for mounts, we got, 5?<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with being &quot;Casual&quot; It's that you feel the need to buy mounts, to have blizzard.. play the game for you. Which is pointless. <br />
<br />
The mount could easily of been something like an inscription mount.<br />
<br />
and no, don't kid yourself, if you buy it... it isn't cool, no one thinks it's cool. It loses any and all &quot;Coolness&quot; because you didn't do anything for it. I can afford the mounts too, I am out at work from 6am till 6pm, but I have, ready? Integrity. I don't need a shiny mount to help me feel good about the fact that I can't raid. And that is why it is pathetic. Don't think just &quot;Hardcores&quot; don't like the store.<br />
<br />
In fact, instantly assuming I'm some shut in that spends hours a day on the game, makes you not only pathetic, but rude. I am... 2/7 Highmaul, and haven't been a hardcore raider since Wotlk, I just recognize that the heroic achievement mounts should look better than the shit you can buy in the store.<br />
<br />
Gah, this is why I don’t do the forum thing. People take things way too personally. I never said anyone was “some shut in”. I was making the point about priorities… Let me backtrack.<br />
<br />
Why do I pay? I’ve been playing since Vanilla. I have way too much invested in this game to up and drop it for a free one. Plus, I enjoy it. I have plenty of mounts that I’ve worked hard for, grinded out. I have been more hardcore at times. Given that, what I do not enjoy these days, is grinding. And don’t kid yourself, you don’t know me. I could care less what people think of me – in game or out of game. I don’t want a mount to look cool to others. I want a mount because I think it looks cool and I love the look of my character (who I have worked hard gearing up, etc) on that mount. It is purely shiny factor for me, but in the same token, that is not why I play this game. It is purely a disdain for grinding mats/gold, or enough reputation on old content. I’d rather be challenged while I kill or heal stuff. Play with friends. Chat. Have fun.<br />
<br />
IMO, it’s akin to wanting a sunroof in your car. You could put it in yourself, learn how to weld, cut it, make the glass, put it in, seal it, etc. Or you could pay someone to do it for you. You’re already paying (or paid for) for the car. Why not pay for a sunroof? No one cares about your sunroof. It doesn’t make you more cool. It doesn’t do anything for you. But you enjoy the sun shining on your face while you drive, so you pay for it. It’s just business. <br />
<br />
Again, Blizzard makes billions. One mount that they sell is NOT the reason their other content may or may not suffer (which, in your opinion, it clearly does). This is not game breaking. This is not gear that makes you more powerful. This is not a faster mount. This is not anything for anyone other than something shiny to sit on. It breaks nothing.<br />
<br />
In principle, I do agree heroic achievement mounts should at least be on par, quality wise, with what you can purchase. Although, that is entirely subjective. People have their preferences. I think the Iron Skyreaver is terrible, but Invincible is incredible. I will never have any of the arena mounts, or the Heroic ZA Timed Bear Mount, or a few of the other epic achievement mounts that have been removed, and which (IMO) are arguably some of the best (I love the ZA bear). So, practically, your point may or may not be true depending on who you are. I think the new clefthoof from the stables is incredible, I love it!<br />
<br />
Anyways … My point is this: I loved the panther mounts in Pandaria, but I’ll be damned if I’m going to grind out exalted AND 20+k in gold for it in mats. I just don’t have time for that. And don’t boil this down to integrity. It has nothing to do with it, or you would not spend money on ANYTHING in this life. It’s ALL consumerism.<br />
<br />
And if we really want to argue about “working for it”, let me talk about it from a business stand point time vs money invested standpoint. It takes a minimum of 30 minutes to run Heroic Icecrown as someone pointed out, times how many runs of the same old content crap, over and over and over. I make roughly $30/hour. Mounts are $25. So, if I have to do more than 2 runs to get a mount, and I can spend $25 to buy it, I have efficiently managed my resources to get something I want.<br />
<br />
Oh, but that’s not the point? It’s not a business, it’s a game? .. Oh that’s right. Then I’ll do what I enjoy (which is NOT grinding for mounts), and you do what you enjoy, and let’s move along.<br />
<br />
If you see me on my purchased mount in game, then please, point and laugh at my stupidity - I probably won’t even notice.<br />
<br />
Cheers mate.<br />
<br />
PS - I never intended to call anyone a &quot;shut in&quot; .. I was trying to prove the point that I simply don't have time to play more than I do, nor do I have any desire. No offence to anyone else intended. You read into that one a little. Not everyone on the internet is a prick.</div></div><hr />

Your response was an outright intentional straw man of my argument and best and most likely simply revealing of your idiocy.<br />
<br />
The worst you could say about my post is that it could not be said to be true for all businesses all the time or even necessarily true for Blizzard at this time. Blizzard could take the revenue from the store mount and not provide a return of value to the community overall beyond the value people who purchased the mount perceived themselves to have gained. The flaw of my post is the unsubstantiated assumption that they would use the revenue from the store mount to fund the production of additional content for the game in general and thus increase the value for all subscribers not just those that bought the mount. And this was essential to my conclusion that people buying the mount increased value for the game for all subscribers and did not cause Blizzard to give us &quot;less free stuff&quot; as the poster to whom I responded claimed.</div></div><hr />

Let's go with the assumption that as unlikely as it is you're not lying. Even then your arguments hold no sway and aren't truthful for one very obvious and simple reason. You're treating this from the corportations point of view and engaging in what can be only described as the same shallow PR Blizzard is most of the time. Except you're not getting paid for doing so, you're doing it for free but it sure shows a lot of the mindet of people like you.<br />

could take the revenue from the store mount and not provide a return of value to the community overall beyond the value people who purchased the mount perceived themselves to have gained. The flaw of my post is the unsubstantiated assumption that they would use the revenue from the store mount to fund the production of additional content for the game in general and thus increase the value for all subscribers not just those that bought the mount. And this was essential to my conclusion that people buying the mount increased value for the game for all subscribers and did not cause Blizzard to give us &quot;less free stuff&quot; as the poster to whom I responded claimed.<br />
And this is where it becomes obvious that you're engaging in PR for Blizzard, you're making up something then run with it expecting everyone to actually believe you despite it obviously being a lie. Your claim is that Blizzard is investing additional ressources in these mounts and then uses the revenue or part of it to add even more to the content thus everyone benefits from it.<br />
This however is absolutely not what is happening and it's pretty obvious to anyone with half a working brain. Instead of using &quot;left over time&quot; as they initially claimed or investing additional resources as you claim they're using the already existing resources that would've been part of the game to begin with to develop these mounts, maximizing profit for their shareholders to the detriment of their customers.<br />
<br />
You might wiggle around and engage in as many hollow claims and empty phrases as you want it's extremly obvious by now that that's what they're doing. The rewards for the reputation factions compared to previous expansions, the mounts actually achievable in game compared to those who went onto the store make that absolutely clear.</div></div><hr />

They use the same skeleton, animations and parts of the body. They changed some details and replaced the head.<br />
Even key features like the saddle bags are there but they replaced them with books so we still have the animations of those intact.<br />
<br />
You are so right!! Look at the posture of the cat, exactly like the one you added..<br />
Just a shame they cant put more time in a &quot;new&quot; mount then to just add something more then<br />
remade bags, armor, color etc on the old &quot;skeleton&quot; <br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
And ye, 10k gold says its gonna be Store mount..<br />

I doubt it, they don't advertise in game mounts. More likely they made this for the legendary questline, then said &quot;Fuck it&quot; and are going to put it on the store, because god knows if the mount isn't brown and ugly, it can't be in the game<br />

The store mount process<br />
<br />
1. New store mount<br />
2. Blizzard makes a fuck ton of money<br />
3. Idiots all realize they bought a mount everyone has<br />
4. you never see the mount again and people go back to using their favorites anyway<br />
<br />
Lemme ask, how many store mounts do you see a week after release? Almost 0, because the primary driving force in this game is looking cooler than other people. Leauge skins at least hold some status because to invest in a skin means (usually) you are skilled/like that specific character<br />
<br />
Im with you totaly, byt then there is that achive called &quot;get 100 zillion mounts&quot; and get reward of ugly ass dragonhawks&quot; <br />
And ppl DO want to get those achives so many purchase not to think &quot;Oh im aloooone with this coolish kitty&quot; but more just to add one towards 250..</div></div><hr />

It is not reasonable to charge AGAIN for what we already pay for. ALL the mounts in the store should be obtainable through an alternate means by playing this game.<br />
<br />
By that logic, all special in game mounts removed or still existing should be added on a rep vendor some where or tied to some achievement as an alternate method of earning them. Since after all, I am paying the same $15 as everyone else, and we all should have rights to those mounts, even the arena mounts we didn't work towards. /sarcasm<br />
<br />
Just because mounts are &quot;contents of the game&quot; doesn't mean every mount is. CE mounts are not contents unless you buy the collectors edition, TCG mounts are not content unless you get damned lucky or pay a small fortune. The store mounts are small bits of additional content (not previously existing) that are sold for people who desire a little more. No they shouldn't be rewards for some feat of strength, added as raid drops, PVP/Arena rewards etc because those areas already have content and rewards. <br />
<br />
Too much imo, especially when things like mounts are added to the store and all you hear is &quot;But me, I want, gimme, it should be in my raid I am running right now and I deserve it because I am running that content and I'm the only one who should have it! Not scrubs who will shell out money that goes to the content I am running and all future content as well!&quot;</div></div><hr />

It has the same sort of glow to its color as the hearthsteed did. ALSO the hearthsteed had scrolls on the back just like it. <br />
If not hearthstone than MAYBE heroes... idk about that though.<br />
Or for sure a store mount but i'd fucking buy this guy. Never bought any of the other store items but i love purple soooo buying if soooo</div></div><hr />

TCG, CE, and store mounts are IN the game...therefore CONTENTS, it just takes additional real life money to unlock them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I'm pretty sure it won't be... I mean I clearly could be wrong but it's a dang nice looking mount regardless and I look forward to see how I can actually get it, and if it is? Who cares, if you want it buy it, if not then don't buy it...</div></div><hr />
