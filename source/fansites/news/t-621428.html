I'm attempting to post this early since the Ret community felt totally surprised last time.<br />
<br />
We are looking at some way of making Avenging Wrath and Divine Shield mutually exclusive. This may be through Forbearance, if we can reduce the Forbearance duration through a hotfix. The bubble is intended as a defensive measure. Yet bubble+wings currently is used a lot in BGs and Arenas and helps contribute to the feeling of being destroyed by a Retribution paladin while you are unable to respond.<br />
<br />
My apologies to the Ret paladins who already feel picked on. We are really trying hard to not overdo anything but even the last round of pretty severe nerfs didn't seem to do enough to Ret's dominance of PvP.<br />
<br />
We are also sympathetic to the notion that if Ret can't do insane burst damage, that the spec might need other tools to be viable in PvP. We're exploring this now, possibly though the missing 11-point Prot talent, possibly through other avenues. We'll let you know when we've made a decision here.<br />
<br />
I don't know exactly when this change will go live, but I didn't want you to return from trick-or-treating and be shocked that we didn't announce it, since that seemed to cause a lot of damage with the last nerf.<br />
<br />
I'll leave this post unlocked for now, assuming the responses stay intelligent and we don't get too much flaming or trolling.<br />
<br />
NOTE: The hotfix will be on Live and the beta. <br />
<br />
[...] We lowered Seal and Judgement damage, changed Divine Storm (earlier) and changed Hammer of Wrath. Those all should have lowered PvP burst damage, and they did.<br />
<br />
The JotW nerf was done because a paladin could use all their buttons quickly then go on to another opponent with no down time. On bosses in PvE, they could hit every button that was up and still have mana left to be very high on healing meters. So we do think the mana regen was too generous in both PvP and PvE cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
Character Transfer Gold Limit Increasing<br />
In preparation for the upcoming launch of Wrath of the Lich King, we will be increasing the gold limit for paid character transfers from 10,000 to 20,000 gold. Players who wish to transfer a level-70 (or higher) character carrying up to 20,000 gold will be able to do so starting Tuesday, November 4, after weekly scheduled maintenance is completed.<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that all other transfer-eligibility requirements, restrictions, and policies remain the same. The new gold limit also applies to free character moves (when offered). For more information, please visit our Paid Character Transfer FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=20558&amp;categoryId=2317&amp;parentCategoryId=&amp;pageNumber=1 (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=20558&amp;categoryId=2317&amp;parentCategoryId=&amp;pageNumber=1)). <br />

Blue posts<br />
Glyphs to remove knockback effects on some abilities<br />
We are considering glyphs that will allow players to remove the knockback from Typhoon, Thunderstorm and Blast Wave in return for some other benefit, such as more damage or a cooldown reduction. You could then use these glyphs when raiding and not make the tanks mad. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12065201405-knockback-effects-have-got-to-go.html))<br />
<br />
Developers decision making process<br />
We do very extensive testing on all aspects of combat balance. Remember, as a large company we have access to testing capabilities far beyond that of the average player. As developers of the game, we also have access to a large number of tools that we don't make public.<br />
<br />
I mention Patchwerk a lot because raiders understand that he is a fight where most of the raid takes no damage and there are no adds or movement issues. It is a very straight-forward fight. &quot;Patchwerk&quot; is shorthand for a tank and spank fight. But he is not a test case for every possible encounter in the game, nor do we use him as such.<br />
<br />
The designers are generally very good at playing a variety of classes. You pretty much have to be to get hired here. We also spend a lot more time with the game than many players are capable of doing, and can look up numbers or gather data that most players have to estimate or guess at. All of this experience probably puts us in the upper percentiles of player skill. Nevertheless, we don't pretend to be the best players in the world in all aspects of WoW, nor do I think that is necessary to do our jobs. We do employ experts on all classes in both PvE and PvP and as a reality check to our own testing, we are also in contact with expert players of the classes throughout the world. We also read this forum and others just to make sure players are experiencing the same thing we're seeing.<br />
<br />
I think sometimes there is a misperception from players that we read the forums all day and when we see someone saying &quot;X is too good&quot; we nerf it and when &quot;Y is too bad&quot; we buff it. Forum feedback, while very helpful, is but a small percentage of our actual testing paradigm. (So is personal experience of that matter.)<br />
<br />
We do make mistakes sometimes, whether because of an undetected bug, or players falling into different spell rotations or gear that we predict, or a number of other reasons. But you generally don't need to worry that e.g. we forgot to test say paladins on non-undead targets. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/12197379738-dev-decision-making.html))<br />

Armor trinkets and bear armor mechanics<br />
We are considering changing the trinkets or the way bear armor works so that finding armor on items doesn't make them so superior for druids. If we make this change, I'll announce it before LK ships so that you don't make a heroic effort to get those items with lots of armor.<br />
<br />
Bear armor would continue to increase as your armor from items went up, so that you'd still want heroic leather before going on to raiding. We would also make sure your overall armor levels didn't drop. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12065089876-tanking-necks-rings-trinkets-etc.html))<br />
<br />
Developers Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/12065146837-ghostcrawler--any-news.html))<br />
The amount of times you can shapeshift before running out of mana is considerably lower now<br />
The counter-argument is that when you shift to bear you are regenerating mana in a fashion that totally protects it from drains and the like. It’s not just as simple as giving you more mana or making the shifting cost cheaper. But it is something we’ll take a look at. <br />
<br />
Why is the druid the only class with a talent based on the number of players in a party? If this is supposed to be a pvp balance thing for arena or to prevent druids from solo tanking then why are we the only class given this special treatment?<br />
I said it’s something we might change. Mostly I wanted to understand if it was an actual balance issue in cases other than niche situations or if it was just something that was just a thorn in your paw. I am pretty sure it’s the latter, but that still doesn’t mean it’s set in stone. <br />
<br />
Improved Leader of the Pack is total mana. This means I regenerate more mana at 70 than I do at 80. At 80 I spend ~35% more on EVERYTHING.<br />
We could change that to base mana I imagine. <br />
<br />
It makes no sense why a resto or balance druid are allowed to shift more than us when WE are supposed to be the masters of shapeshifting because we are the ones who specced to improve our animalistic side. All we want is to be pvp viable and not be so restricted on mana, I would be lucky if I could even manage an arena fight at this stage with the mana I have now, I wouldnt beable to do anything really.<br />
I’m not sure I would use that line of reasoning. The casters could just as easily say that they are the most fragile so they need the means to escape or deal with melee more than a Feral. It doesn’t invalidate your whole argument, but I don’t think this particular point makes it stronger. <br />
<br />
I think you need to spend more time on the EJ forums. If there was a trinket with -100 Stamina and +1000 armor, Druids would wear it. White +Armor items are that overpowered. Regarding PVP gear for tanking, we're not giving up &quot;a lot of stats to get marginally better Stamina.&quot; We're giving up stats which are irrelevant for tanking (AP, strength, expertise past the cap) for Stamina. Tanks generate 7000tps; threat generation is an invalid concern. Therefore, unless the PVE gear provides superior mitigation (like the +armor T6 did) or increased Stamina, then bears will be forced to wear PVP gear in order to have the best survivability while tanking.<br />
We do follow those forums. They have very smart people posting there, but of course they are not right about everything either. You can find many excellent as well as a few mediocre suggestions there. Their best aspect is the signal to noise ratio is very strong. Since you point it out though, one thing I wish our posters could learn from those forums is how to communicate with each other. Our forums have far too many threads where dissenting opinions are ignored instead of addressed.<br />
<br />
On the armor thing, I still feel like you are trying to turn this into “GC doesn’t understand Feral itemization.” I realize that line of thinking might make it easier to dismiss our point of view when you disagree with it, but it's not true and not really the issue. Xaamau’s original concern was “Not enough &quot;Armor&quot; trinkets in game making them invaluable to druids, basically once you have these trinkets you will not grab anything else unless you reach armor cap.” I just don’t think the second part is an issue. Depending on your existing armor and other stats and what other pieces you can upgrade, you are not going to only look at armor on trinkets and ignore everything else they can do. The first part is of more concern if bears have trouble getting the trinkets they need. <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd be much happier if armor was removed from trinkets/necks/rings/staves altogether, and druids were given a talent to convert DPS stats to tanking stats (maybe bump the armor conversion from agi, or turn AP into a bit of dodge). That way we wouldn't have to &quot;steal&quot; necks/rings from plate tanks, and we could use similar accessories for both cat and bear. And if someone in the itemization team slips and lets a 1k armor blue staff through, it isn't immediately heralded as a better tanking staff than any epic in the game. It also gives a smoother progression though the tiers of raiding, since you won't need a separate DPS and tanking staff and only have access to 1 staff per tier.<br />
We have discussed this before, and I do think removing armor completely as a stat has a lot of merit. I do think it would cause a lot of complaints from druids who didn't understand why we were doing it.<br />
<br />
I have already expressed my distaste for feral-specific weapons (though I own plenty of them). They are some of the last vestiges of the antiquated system where certain characters are very dependent on relatively uncommon items that cause frustration among other players when they drop. That situation in turn makes the items even rarer, and therefore even more of a big deal when they drop. <br />
<br />
Potential changes to itemization ...<br />
Changing armor would be work, but possible to do within the confines of Lich King (though probably not before it shipped). If we decide to do it, we will make sure you know ASAP so that nobody is struggling to get Defender's Code. Changing feral attack power is more work, but in that case the weapon would still be just as good for you as it is now, so it affects what items you collect less. <br />

Abilities uptime and mana cost<br />
You should be able to spam Consecrate if you use Divine Plea. This is what we, and I believe others, have found. You should be able to use Divine Storm, Crusader Strike and a Judgement without Divine Plea and keep mana up almost indefinitely.

Developers Q&amp;A (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065381474-gc-warlock-concerns-attempt-2.html))<br />
- Chaos bolt, Instant. (Why, because destruction is still way to dependant on Casting+Stationary , LOS, and being locked out of spell trees. Mostly make it instant for pvp but would also help pve dps if locks decided to go this path.) I know hunters have simular line of sight complaints but I beleive this is hurting destruction a lot more then our hunter friends. <br />
We're talking a lot about warlocks in PvP right now. Instant-cast spells may or may not be one of the changes we'll make. Ultimately, changing Chaos Bolt and Haunt to instant just makes them different spells. We would have to nerf them significantly to make them instant, which would have PvE ramifications. Warlocks do have a fair number of spells they can cast while moving. <br />
<br />
Give demon form a permanent form for warlocks, especially if your going to be succeptable to MORE cc then you were before IE Turn evil and Banish. (Why, because &quot;I know blizz hates it when we compare classes but&quot; every other talented form regardless of damage reduction abilities is permanent if you spec into it&quot; So unless this is a failed attempt at Beastial Wraith which may I remind you makes you immune to All types of CC not adds more) As well Give Soul Link the 5% bonus damage back, not sure who in the world decided to take this away. <br />
We don't want warlocks to be in demon form all the time. I think we've explained the Soul Link change before. <br />
<br />
Give us back our old Self Buffs, the New fel armor is not cool and the Armor on Demon armor is downright terrible. I guess this is complaining so my solution, fel armor, 130 spell dmg and 30% more + healing, Demon Armor 2000 Armor+ and increased health regen. <br />
What is your beef with Fel Armor? Our internal testing found that once you have gear with Sprit on it that it can improve you dps by 20% or even more. You may be low at your current levels without Spirit. That will change in just a couple of weeks. <br />
<br />
There is talk about dispel resistance for destruction! this is kick ass and long overdue, what about for the few dots demon locks use? <br />
We're looking at dispel resistance for locks in general. <br />

Bloodsurge<br />
All you have to do is tweak Bloodsurge to allow us to slam more often and that will solve 2 major problems fury warriors have. What I am going to propose below isn't even some huge buff that will scale fury warriors out of control. <br />
Yep, we like this idea a lot. I'm not certain this is the approach we'll take, but it's an idea (Bloodsurge -&gt; Slam) that has come up several times around the office. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065281241-gc--stop-ignoring-bloodsurge--warriors.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
First post trolling and not having a clue of what you are talking about. Mutilate has been always been a pvp spec but not actually used. Unless living under a rock arena has been dominated by shadowstep/combat rogues.<br />
<br />
Mutilate needed a buff and yes we are now going to use mutilate in pve/pvp. Blizzard did this to offer rogues an option to move from combat swords builds to something more fun and challenging to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um... ok. Suuuuure. Makes perfect sense. I guess beta didn't show ret as OP in 80s Arena, but does in 70, so nerf 70 and 80! Ok, sure, sounds about right. Sigh.... makes me think that there may be more than gin in GC's coffee.<br />
<br />
And holy, poor, holy. Holy feels that it is a niche tank healer, and a niche that other healers can do well enough. And they have gotten very little attention from Bliz while tankadins got a lot and ret is now getting put under the spotlight (and getting fried for it). My 4 ret/holy friends are turning their pally mains into banks, no joke, and going main line their boomkin/resto druids. While they never bought into the whole lolret thing, they unfortunately do now.<br />

<br />
I can't really understand how blizzard thinks when it comes to retpallies. I mean, there's a whole batch of nerfs on the way that haven't even gone live and they're already queing up the next ones?<br />
<br />
Where exactly do they gather their information about Ret pallies pvp efficiency? Not the EU betaserver atleast, it's performance is so bad that I bet that you'd get a more stable server if you installed the server software on an electrical toothbrush and from what I hear the US betaservers aren't performing very well either.<br />
<br />
Why is every other specc told that they're going to wait till 80 and see how things look then before any adjustments are made, while the ret nerfs are rolling off the production lines in droves? I agree that ret needed nerfing, but at the moment, I can't see retribution recovering from all this. Retribution gets no new damaging skills on their way up to 80 and their only damaging skill that gets a new rank is hammer of wrath. The only thing retribution has going for itself in pvp is it's burst damage and that is getting twacked by the nerfbat while the amount of hitpoints a player has will jump up to around ~19 000, meaning that retpallies will have alot more trouble killing people at 80. <br />
<br />
I have a friend who plays a retribution paladin, he's one of them stubborn fellows who've stuck to playing retribution despite being mocked for applying to guilds, kicked out of heroic groups or just being /lol'ed at because he was idling in Ironforge while wearing a two handed weapon and the amount of 'lolret' comments I've seen thrown at him is just... <br />
<br />
It's true that 3.0.2 overdid it's their tuneup of the retribution specc and retpallies deserve some nerfs - What I'm concerned about that all these nerfs will overdo things and the retpallies will go back to being the unwanted, mocked and shunned specc they've more or less been ever since the game launched.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that where my two cents. I'm off to bed.</div></div><hr />

I mean, seriously, the wording on a lot of it is spot on of how I talked about it with him.<br />
<br />
I changed the face of Ret Paladins! Nyah! ;D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ajaxthegreat</div><div class="date">2008-11-01, 05:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, they're gonna make it so prot can't use shield wall after using Wings? They just simply need to make a short duration debuff that lasts 15 seconds. It 's like forbearance (the pre-3.0 one) but only lasts for 15 seconds and is activated on Wings. While it's active, you can't bubble. They'd need to make it so that attempting to cats one would cancel the other out though.<br />
<br />
They need to think carefully about what steps they take next...REALLY carefully.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the solution is quite simple: have AW not cause forebearance as it shouldn't, but make DS and AW overwrite each other. You can buble and then pop AW once the danger passes, but you lose your buble; or use AW and buble once you are taking too much focus fire. Simple, fair, effective.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpohagan</div><div class="date">2008-11-01, 06:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope they don't stuff around with AW on forbearance. The reason why they took it off (and nerfed the +dmg% to partly compensate) was because in having to choose between bubble and AW, bubble always won out - pallies go down like a sack of spuds without bubble and popping AW in arena was very risky business: focusing ret pallies isn't such a bad strat atm - their bubbling defensively (and having to &quot;waste&quot; the time to heal to full) sure beats an offensive bubble, you can at least try and get some distance during those 5secs). <br />
<br />
Not that &quot;risky business&quot; is a bad thing for a cooldown with such a large buff to damage, but it often wasn't worth it. Divine purpose and HoF out of stuns will help survivability somewhat at present though I guess. What I'm getting at, is if they put it back on forbearance (and the current rediculously long forbearance) it just won't get used. Perhaps they should re-think the whole nature of the buff.<br />
<br />
The solution I can think of is make bubble and AW mutually exclusive - i.e. when you bubble AW is removed, and AW is uncastable during bubble. I understand that this is a nerf to holy pallies too, and I'm not really sure of how to fix it. Blizz really have fucked up though, haven't they?<br />
<br />
I'm not really sure what to think - and most of us aren't qualified to have an opinion because we just haven't tested things: all I know is that nerfs were very justified to ret damage. I'm uneasy at the rapidity and sheer number of nerfs though - it just doesn't seem like a scientific test changing so many variables at once. All I can really do is have faith that they'll get it right: making a defensive burst damage dealer work is probably a big ask - perhaps they should have changed the fundamentals of the class a bit more in their &quot;overhaul&quot;.</div></div><hr />

and when we are at it... where are the arcane mage nerfbats? tell us, because if that is balanced than you are out of your mind. start listening to normal players not retarded crybabies/QQers pls. <br />

They were both buffed and were OP, they take nerfs so they are less OP but still in the neighborhood just less OP than they were, they QQ hard but get some more nerfs so they are even less OP but still a lil OP, they QQ more in hopes of keeping some part of their OPness.<br />
<br />
Like my god, do you remember the QQ out of locks when they couldn't simply spam drain life on a any warrior in any gear level and win easily anymore?<br />
It was pure silliness heh.<br />
It's the same crap coming from ret pallies now, OMG I can't waste 10 people in a row without dieing or running out of mana. LOL I say.<br />

Meanwhile the classes that are UP (under powered) get lost in all the OP classes' QQ.<br />

Locks were a joke pre BC, they got buffed to crazy levels then nerfed back down to respectibility.<br />
The exact same thing is happening to Pallies now.<br />
Pallies you got little to QQ about, i'm sorry but you don't.<br />
Even with all these nerfs, you're still 10 times better than you were and STILL more powerfull than the majority of the other classes...seriously wtf is your problem? lol</div></div><hr />

How many nerfs are they going to throw at ret-paladins before they are satisfied? Isn't there some other class out there that needs some attention? I feel like they are ignoring every other class while nerfbatting ret to the ground. Though I guess I should be glad they are focusing on ret, they seem to be in a bad mood and other classes are spared the nerfbat while ret takes the heat.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, warrior eh? Top-of-the-pile tank for all of BC and also managed to make your way onto the top of the pile in every arena season thanks to MS and droods (To be fair warrior/holy paladin was a great combo season 1.... until holy got nerfes). You sure have a lot to complain about...<br />
<br />
Ever think that ret paladins understand they were OP but that they don't understand Blizzard's A) IMMEDIATE reaction (when has there ever been such a storm of nerfs and hotfixes targeting one class?) and B) completely unscientific way of nerfing. How can you change so many variables @ once and feel like you can reasonably predict the outcome?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining about anything other than assinine and unwarented QQ.<br />
Sure, warriors have been good to play but that is because we are mid range. We are not OP and not UP.<br />
Contrary to popular belief you do not and did not succeed by just mashing buttons in either high level arena or high level tanking.<br />
Both take skill to rise above.<br />
Sure, in a perfect world all classes would be like this but they're not.<br />
<br />
Like I said, i'm not complaining about any classes here.<br />
I am complaining about all the stupid QQ from classes that are horribly OP, take nerfs to be less OP but are still in better shape than many of the other classes or even other specs.<br />
The Pally forums are so full of assinine ret QQ that the Holy and Prot pallies who are the ones with the real and legitimate concerns are getting lost.<br />
<br />
...and for the record, I have never complained about a single warrior nerf in the 4+ years i have played one except one.<br />
When BC came out and our rage gen was normalized into the ground, it was too much and we suffered badly. It was raised and has been fine ever since no matter what others think.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, if you don't think these nerfs to ret were not needed....you quite frankly are a blind moron lol.<br />
<br />
As far as Blizzards fast reaction...they have always been fast on something if it was way out of whack and ret pallies were waaaaayyy out of whack lol.<br />
You know if you can take a brand new 70 in blues and greens into a BG and wtfown everything you see whether they are in full s4 or not, that can be a bit of an indication heh.<br />
<br />
Oh and get your facts straight, Druids became the kings of tanking as soon as they got into a lil bit of t5.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aidda</div><div class="date">2008-11-01, 09:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As it is currently on beta, on LVL 80 with mostly lvl 70 SWP tanking gear and few lvl 80 upgrades, the protection paladin is something that you dont realy enjoy to play. Having some experience already in some instances, inlcusiv heroics, or 10-man raids, you want to play a bit faster, to pull a pack without having to top your mana bar before each pull, to build at least a decent ammount of aggro so your dpsers feel confortable. But sadly is impossible. Due to the beta paladins nerfs that are already going on, to build a decent aggro means already spaming consecration, HoR, HS, AW and judgement every cd ofc, but this, with divine plea used, still leads yoou to oom, even to have enough mana for special movement (see here, 1 mage overaggro, you want to taunt and judge imediatly, as a nice person you are, and you keep some kind of cooldown ready for things like that) . <br />
<br />
Already, with current beta build, the paladin tank feel frustrated between building enough aggro and building a bit of aggro and basing on his group to play safety , without overaggroing. Found myself asking the ppl (and im speaking about lvl 80 instances here and beta build) &quot;hey , wait 6-7 seconds for aggro pls&quot; - not that i cant build it fast enough, but that i dont want to because i would go too fast oom. And even with blessing of sanctuary and blessing of wisdom, and sometimes serious hits taken, the game speed is too high, to be able to tank decently with 5-6k mana, how much you have with all buffs up. Sure... is possible to tank, but you start to feel that you do it as before 3.0.2, when the paladin threat was a pretty high issue and who played that before, know what im saying. <br />
<br />
We came back to &quot;hey dont you pull ?&quot; .... &quot;no, pls wait for mana&quot; .... &quot;noob tank with mana bar&quot;.<br />
And the trick with staying down or turning the back to somee mobs, to get some extra hits and a bit of extra healing so you top your mana bar, is not efficient everywhere, not to say that a current healer wont heal you before you reach a certain level of HP, mostly, because of the healing mechanic changes.<br />
<br />
But overall, im still pretty pozitive that new class changes will come and will fix these issues. Just that im afraid will come beyound lvl 80, and even deep in Lich king.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bals</div><div class="date">2008-11-01, 09:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Like I said earier, and other people have, I really don't think this is much of a ret pally nerf as they think it is and affects prot and holy much more. I know there are times when i'm healing as holy and due to the lack of aoe healing and sometimes insane amounts of aoe damage being done I simply just can't keep up 5 people at once so I'll bubble to give myself some leeway in having 1 less person to worry about for a few seconds. But now I can't use avenging wrath for 20% more healing. What if I had used avenging wrath at the beginning of the pull since I knew it would be a healing intensive pull? Now, I'm more than likely dead cause I can't heal more than 2 people (if there's aoe damage) because I can't bubble. Not to mention prot has to choose between shield wall and extra threat now. As ret I hardly ever use bubble for pvp (unless it's some random person trying to gank me), it's just lame. I only do it when people ask me to because they think beating me when i use bubble makes their epenis 4 inches longer or something</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're so fucking bad.<br />
<br />
1) Warriors have been overpowered as fuck in Arenas for all of BC. The only thing keeping you from nerfed into the fucking ground is a rogue could take your place in totally different setups and play like a gimped warrior.<br />
<br />
2) If you couldn't out-tank a druid after T5, you just fail. Seriously. Warriors were THE maintank class for all of BC. Show me more than 5 guilds out of the top 50,000 on wowjutsu without a warrior MT. (Shear anyone?)</div></div><hr />

If you think of it You havnt fixed the thing that paladins are so easily to be kited in battle grounds that we need to use battle order to catch our enemies but it doesn't work either when our enemy just runs away from us for next 12seconds and then keeps kiting us more... Blizzard is nerfing totally wrong things in paladins. Example 25players plays world of warcraft 3 of em are paladins and 9 are warriors... after the patch paladins could stand up agaisnt the warriors which made them yell they are OP it is diffrent when 3 people goes QQ than 9 people starts whining. People are so used to have Paladins only as healers or Tanks so they have forgotten we do have that 3rd talent build too whichs is called Retribution and is made for leveling pve&amp;pvp dps. Thats why everyclass are moaning about paladins beeing overpowered* cause they used to have fun toying around with them. Wings and bubble is to be used together otherwise wings are only getting debuffed or spellstolen... :(* I don't know why blizzard doesnt do anything to other OP classes or are they just denieing it that they doesnt think Warriors, Mages or balance druids are OP. example Warrior with healer runs into group of enemy in warsong gulch* and uses bladestorm which cannot be stunned or feared or stopped anyhow and with nice weapon dealing 2,5k-6k dmg in matter of seconds if not even faster healer keeping him alive and so is the opposite team's troops annihilated in 6seconds or how long it lasts that bladestorm. Arcane mages have vanish and they can cast tons of spells in 6seconds aswell and boomkin druids dps is insane. Imo blizzard should take a look deeper into this fact not just what rumors you hear like &quot;yup friend of mine had heard from her cousins daughts bestfriend<br />
s mother's friend's uncle that paladins are using spells that deals ALOT BURST dmg&quot; *10minutes laters* paladins are nerfed back into lolret and beeing one shotted kited and mana burned into death. (okey that maybe a far fetched one... but still) I cannot believe that we are going back to be lolret in wotlk... everyclass out dpsing us rogues stunlocking us to death, priests manaburning, shamans nuking warlocks fearing , hunters kiting, druids kiting, warriors nuking, when it comes to paladin vs paladin both goes bubble and heartstones away... in wotlk we sure wil be owned by deathknight's ghoul...* :'( Blizzard Should think before you do these nerfs and its not all just to be imba in arena or so... if we use wings we use bubble just to keep our wings up or if we use bubble its mostly just because so we can get to the enemy... While im dueling with people and when i win most common sentences these days are &quot;Omg lol you used bubble&quot; , &quot;Omg lol u used lay on hands&quot; , &quot;omg lol u used wings&quot; , &quot;omg lol you healed&quot; , &quot;omg you are overpowered go home kid&quot; What the hell are we then supposed to do? beat up other players and annoying kids who doesn't have has no life with sticks and harash language. I hope you take this post seriously and read it carefully and think what i've said here... I do agree that paladins was OP in first place but this is just getting out of hand and its preposterous to nerf us till we are lolret and if people see us in raids or groups they are going to go like &quot;Hey cant we just replace this retardin they are useless&quot; or when i whisper to group leader can i join ur team for heroic he asks what spec i am im just getting lolled...* <br />

&gt;doing, and can look up numbers or gather data that most players have to estimate or guess at. <br />
&gt;All of this experience probably puts us in the upper percentiles of player skill. Nevertheless, <br />
&gt;we don't pretend to be the best players in the world in all aspects of WoW, nor do I think that <br />
&gt;is necessary to do our jobs. We do employ experts on all classes in both PvE and PvP and as a <br />
&gt;reality check to our own testing, we are also in contact with expert players of the classes <br />
&gt;throughout the world. We also read this forum and others just to make sure players are experiencing <br />
&gt;the same thing we're seeing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hahahaha, oh my god, hahaha, rofl.<br />
<br />
The devs - expert players. What a joke! You are cluelessly fixing things around in the hope that<br />
something will work. All those clever tools your large company has didn't help much here.<br />
<br />
Especially you, GC. Want some examples?<br />
- After discussing hunter itemazation you admitted that you &quot;forgot&quot; that hunters don't get dex*2 RAP <br />
anymore<br />
<br />
- or your brilliant advice for hunters that they should let &quot;their pets keep someone busy while drinking<br />
in the arena&quot;, totally ignoring that if the pet is in combat, so is the hunter, and therefore they<br />
can't drink at all!<br />
<br />
I could go on for some time, but I think you get my point. And you have the guts to lecture us about<br />
what we know about this game. How they hell did you get your job?</div></div><hr />

SO you're saying you wasn't overpowered? Being able to be immune to damage while absolutely destroying everything was ridiculous. What do you expect Blizzard to do exactly?

<br />
Make them overwrite eachother? Just make it so that timing your avenging wrath wrong (before a burst incoming) makes you ruin it because you are forced to bubble. The other way around it also ruins your defense; you can't both be offensive and immune =) problem solved =)<br />

<br />
Let's not even discuss how 50% of your damage is bypassing armor for the duration, which isn't even needed all that much since your SoC &amp; HoW are not mitigated by anything.<br />
<br />
These changes still don't address the issue that most of ret's abilities are now insta-cast, so the swing time penalty is a non-issue while bubbled. Retribution used to rely on melee damage with some holy, but it has been shifted to holy damage with some melee - bubble should be adjusted accordingly since the penalty no longer has the weight it once had.<br />
<br />
No class should be able to become immune to all forms of damage while still doing that much damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In regards to the possible changes to Avenging Wrath and Divine SHield, please, please don't go back to the minute forbearence between the two. All that did before is make EVERYONE target the paladin with wings up and the paladin had no defensive ability whatsoever. In arenas you basically had to choose which to use, wings or bubble, thereby handcuffing the class.<br />
<br />
I do reconize theissue with bubbling with wings up, and think that is a problem. How about this just making it so that only one can be active at a time? That would solve all the problwms. The post before me about one overwrite each other is a great idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just going to point out that we were only able to &quot;be immune to damage while destroying everything&quot; for a handful of seconds. Just because for once in who knows how long we were able to actually fight on par with everyone else does not mean we should just get destroyed before release. Some of the nerfs were valid, I agree 100%, but just because people like you get frustrated and whine when a pally wipes the ground with you shouldn't eqate to a total nerf-fest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is simply ridiculous in almost every sense. Paladins are good, but are they that game breaking they need to hot fixed like this? I mean, really? Meanwhile mages are running around dominating people with arcane spec.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should be VERY ashamed with the way they are treating Paladins. <br />
<br />
At least try and do a bit more give and take. Paladins are by no mean perfect and have quite a few issues. They will have even more if you keep pushing stuff like this. Just glad I swapped my Holy Paladin for a Holy Priest.</div></div><hr />

No I think you need to read the post you are quoting.<br />

What he said was not that it wasn't overpowered,<br />

but that Paladins had been like this for many weeks and months on the beta servers and Blizzard did not take any action then, despite all their tests for dps balance and the rest.<br />
<br />
Now we are seeing lots of hotfix nerfs for Paladins, which if you read between the lines is an admittance that something at Blizzard went very wrong and they made some huge mistakes here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's just sad that Holy is nerfed once again. We are already the worst healer ingame, in some situations a Retribution Paladin in Holy gear is better then us.<br />
<br />
Holy doesn't stand a chance of high level ratings in Arena 2vs2 and 3vs3, that are the only brackets that matter anyway.<br />
<br />
Holy dps is half of the other healers and now took another hit, and the last seal nerf isn't even accounted already.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse Holy was looking for wings to compensate the 20% healing penalty from Divine Plea, and now it can't be done, great.<br />
<br />
Holy was one of the most neglected Class on this preparition period for WOTLK, we didn't got a single new healing spell, just some twicks to our 3 healing spells! We got a shield, a mana return mechanism that is a copy from Mage's evocation and is dispellable, more range on judgements but that hit for half the damage that were before the patch, some more waste, and some beacon that costs a lot of mana and that we can't use to good effect on 25-man raids because overhealing is wasted.<br />
<br />
I have nothing against Retribution and i hopes you Guys are finally viable for pve and pvp but Holy needs a lot of love now or people won't play it, i know i won't.<br />
<br />
P.S. - And please don't come here and say that Holy is better because your heals are going for more then before the patch, because blessing of light was folded into our heals so it's supposed to hit for more!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thogrim</div><div class="date">2008-11-01, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah. It's quite clear that Blizzard is missing some important points. Actually... If you are able to nuke someone down without dying every 5 minutes... Is that OP? Rogues are able to do taht all the time, just like mages. How ever I think forebearence was good. Why did they took it away? And now keeping it as a reason to nerf paladins so much that they are not able to do anything... I think hybrid classes should be able to do as much damage in PvP as pure dps classes, but difference would come in PvE. Hybrid classes should be able to do things properly without other players, and be good in PvP, and PvE. Not &quot;Can be (((TOLERATED)))!!!<br />
&quot;. Funny is it? You chose hybrid class when you began to pay wow when you did not knew much about classe, and now you are not able to do anything... Blizzard is tralking of paladin OP PvP bursts... Look at the mages... Any of their skills does not take armour saves, and they are doing insane damage while oppoent is trying to get away from Slow, Frostnova, other freezing effect, and in bad situation just iceblock, invisible or blick. You got damage absorbing shields, and if you go out of mana, you can escape wth frostnova and blick, and the opponent have nothing to do for that. Then you just Evocate and come back to kill your opponent.<br />
Rogues got Evasion. They are actually invinsible while using evasion, and still able to do insane damage, not even 100% increased time between attacks. &quot;Then you may say... Rogues nor mages can heal... Well retribution paladines dont have ime for healin really either.(If not using bubble, but while healing with bubble you CANT &quot;Do insane damage while being immune to all types of damage&quot;.) And allredy blizzard has spoiled idea of Divine Shield. It is supppose to be shield that protects you from any harm, and now priests are able to dispell it...<br />
Oh whohoo. Lets wait anohter 5 minutes to get t back. Many retri paladin dont even use bubble much cause we see that we have to learn play without it cause there is so many times that it is in cd. If Blizzard is nefing retri palas to be as good as other classes while using bubble that means retripaladines can be every 5 minutes be 12 sec as good as other classes, and then drop down to be useless filt. Give us more options in changing seals judgement , and hands spells, so it requires some skill to use them.(It is not suppose to be that retri palas are able to kill all other classes without skill, nor retri palad are not able to take any classs down even with skill...)<br />
If people thin all paladin players are 7 year old and are playing pala cause they want to be good hero knight who conquers evil just like in children animations. No... If you think that way your way of seeing things is quite twisted... If you dont think paladines got no skill let them even show it. Dont make conclusion without any evidence.(And how do you know that even if so paladin players woude be 7 years old who just want to play paladin cause its &quot;holy knight&quot;, it is possiple that they are much better players than you are.) And actually I dont know any paladin player that would be so young.<br />
In my point of view paladines should be as much as &quot;Holy defenders of divinity&quot;, puritain inquisitors who destroy everything they consider to be unclean. &quot;Absolution in death&quot;. (If someone asks... Yes I have played Warhammer 40K.) But how ever open your mind. It's just a game. It's not. Paladines can't do good damage cause I think it does not fit to &quot;WoW lore&quot;...<br />
I dont say that many of you would think in a way I described, just wanted to say write couple of possiple stereotypies, like I have heard on this forum. &quot;Paladines are for those who are willing to play while downloadin insane amount of porn while playing.&quot;<br />
(Hope so my own text did not sound too serious, but just wanted to bring some points that blizzard should think of, cause I got only one 70lvl character and it's paladin, and I dont want blizzard to spoil my only 70 lvl class. I got no time to level up another one...)</div></div><hr />

Sure, warriors have been good to play but that is because we are mid range. We are not OP and not UP.<br />
Contrary to popular belief you do not and did not succeed by just mashing buttons in either high level arena or high level tanking.<br />
Both take skill to rise above.<br />
Sure, in a perfect world all classes would be like this but they're not.<br />
<br />
Like I said, i'm not complaining about any classes here.<br />
I am complaining about all the stupid QQ from classes that are horribly OP, take nerfs to be less OP but are still in better shape than many of the other classes or even other specs.<br />
The Pally forums are so full of assinine ret QQ that the Holy and Prot pallies who are the ones with the real and legitimate concerns are getting lost.<br />
<br />
...and for the record, I have never complained about a single warrior nerf in the 4+ years i have played one except one.<br />
When BC came out and our rage gen was normalized into the ground, it was too much and we suffered badly. It was raised and has been fine ever since no matter what others think.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, if you don't think these nerfs to ret were not needed....you quite frankly are a blind moron lol.<br />
<br />
As far as Blizzards fast reaction...they have always been fast on something if it was way out of whack and ret pallies were waaaaayyy out of whack lol.<br />
You know if you can take a brand new 70 in blues and greens into a BG and wtfown everything you see whether they are in full s4 or not, that can be a bit of an indication heh.<br />
<br />
Oh and get your facts straight, Druids became the kings of tanking as soon as they got into a lil bit of t5.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is so much bad in this post I ALMOST didn't know where to start.<br />
<br />
1) I NEVER said that ret-paladins didn't need a nerf. I even said &quot;Ever think that ret-paladins know they were OP...&quot; My complaint is the suspiciously fast response and also the sheer magnitude of across-the-board nerfs.<br />
<br />
2) Continuing a train of thought from point 1, Blizzard RARELY reacts with the speed they have. In fact, I cannot recall another time in WoW history that Blizzard has dropped the hammer this hard and this fast. Within 48 hours of 3.0.2 going live the first ret-paladin HOTFIXES hit the servers and it has been a steady nerf-train since then. Blizzard ADMITTED that they KNEW resto-droods were OVER-THE-TOP OVERPOWERED and were DOMINATING PvP but that they were afraid of PvE ramifications. WHAT BULLSHIT! They have slashed-and-burned ret-paladin PvE, but also they have cleaved Prot and Holy. They let resto-droods slide along for nearly a year of admitted OPness and DOMINATION of PvP without a single nerf or &quot;hotfix&quot;.<br />
<br />
3) The statement about ret-pallies owning s4 geared players as a fresh 70 in blues and greens is such utter bullshit that by saying such nonsense I have trouble taking anything else you type seriously.<br />
<br />
4) Finally, you are retarded. Warriors are the BC unquestioned kings of tanking. Period. End of story. lolcrushingblow on your drood. And gl with shear on Illidan. (and before you even type stupid nonsense, I know both of those mechanics are gone. But we are specifically talking about BC when they existed.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have a full immunity that still allows you near freedom of action, clears your debuffs etc. And you have a flat dps % increase button. Generally a class is punished for flat large dps increase. Shadowform=no heals, zerker stance= get hit harder, arcane power= mana(not to mention this to can be dispelled and stolen). Shadows version of bubble is 6secs 90% less damage, and can't cast, doesn't clear debuffs and can be CC'd. Mages can't move at all.<br />
<br />
Just because you have to choose now doesn't make your class broken, it just means that if you choose incorrectly, you will pay the price. Heaven forbid your choices have an effect on game play.<br />
<br />
I do think some ret nerfs were uncalled for and it does seem like you are getting picked on. I say give back some of your burst that was taken and let the AV/bubble change stay. I think that will fix stuff.</div></div><hr />

No need to rape it with Forbearance. You simply just give the Wings a cd equally to the duration of the shield. Just like trinkets. Problem solved. Let's move on.<br />
<br />
On a side note, when I bubble on my paladin, it is to heal myself. But I guess there is enough of those gun-ho retri paladins out there who doesn't care about dying and just bubble and wings and jump into a crowd trying to kill people.<br />

<br />
So what? Instead of staffs that sometimes are useful to Hunters, too, let us have 2H maces with lots of Agi, that Warriors/Paladins will also like? Give us dual-wielding and let us roll on rogue daggers? (btw, another weapon type that is pretty class-specific)<br />
There is no good solution to this problem.<br />

1) Warriors have been overpowered as fuck in Arenas for all of BC. The only thing keeping you from nerfed into the fucking ground is a rogue could take your place in totally different setups and play like a gimped warrior.<br />
<br />
2) If you couldn't out-tank a druid after T5, you just fail. Seriously. Warriors were THE maintank class for all of BC. Show me more than 5 guilds out of the top 50,000 on wowjutsu without a warrior MT. (Shear anyone?)<br />

<br />
LOL!!!<br />
<br />
Hmmmm....in 2's<br />
Well lets see here, was War/Shammy OP.....after WF got nerfed to auto attacks only, not a chance.<br />
Was War/Priest OP....no.<br />
Was War/pally OP....in S1 before anyone really had full resilience and before holy pallies got nerfed....sure.<br />
Was any dps combo of war/?......NO.<br />
War/druid.....yes but was lock/druid, rogue/druid, hunter/druid any less.<br />
<br />
In 3's<br />
Gimme a break here, PMR ruled 3's.<br />
On top of this, show me an official 3v3 tourny where you would see more than even one team with a warrior on it full time.<br />
<br />
In 5's<br />
Euro comp did better overall than any other comp period and there aint no warrior there.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as end game tanking, you bring up the single fight where a warrior was needed as in Illy. <br />
Tell me though, who was at least one of their OT's on the fire adds...hmmmm?<br />
I mean seriously...the entire SW debuff was aimed specif at druids because they were too good.<br />
Druids had 20% more total avoidance, 50% more armor, 10% more health, 50% more dps and didn't have to rely on incoming rage to keep good tps.<br />

<br />
it also sucks for ret soloability. for big pulls youre stuck choosing between a bubble or the extra damage. this is a huge drawback that shouldnt exist. other classes have extra damage and it doesnt effect their escape abilities. this is flat out over the top. if you dont want pve bubble to be ruined, then make the freaking bubble dispellable by more classes in pvp and go from there by giving the pally other defensive abilities. this makes me mad. i hate it when pve gets ruind by pvp balance.<br />
<br />
how about you just make it so you cant dps in bubble (heals only?) and stop ruining pve with these bullshit cooldowns??!</div></div><hr />

Well, maybe i was biased.<br />
I ran rank 12 2h fury with a BRE pre bc and locks were just free hk's for me.<br />
They were still a joke in pve though with no threat reduction and would SS themselves and then self hell fire, die and rez to continue dpsing heh.</div></div><hr />

Euro comp did better overall than any other comp period and there aint no warrior there.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as end game tanking, you bring up the single fight where a warrior was needed as in Illy. <br />
Tell me though, who was at least one of their OT's on the fire adds...hmmmm?<br />
I mean seriously...the entire SW debuff was aimed specif at druids because they were too good.<br />
Druids had 20% more total avoidance, 50% more armor, 10% more health, 50% more dps and didn't have to rely on incoming rage to keep good tps.<br />
<br />
Gimme a fucking break, you are a moron.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, your OTs are feral druids... Well, I can't really think why you wouldn't bring 3 prot spec warriors. OH WAIT! If you bring feral droods they can go cat and put out more DPS than prot warriors and contribute more to the raid while not tanking!<br />
<br />
<br />
Druids had 20% more total avoidance, 50% more armor, 10% more health, 50% more dps and didn't have to rely on incoming rage to keep good tps.<br />
<br />
<br />
That particular statement was so stupid I needed to quote it twice. First of all, those numbers are completely wrong. 100%. Second. If bear droods didn't need to rely on inc rage for tps... what did they rely on?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newor</div><div class="date">2008-11-01, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anybody that thinks doing 20% more damage while being completely invulnerable wasn't completely overpowered, you need to be playing an insta-gib quake server instead of WoW.<br />
<br />
Let's not even discuss how 50% of your damage is bypassing armor for the duration, which isn't even needed all that much since your SoC &amp; HoW are not mitigated by anything.<br />
<br />
These changes still don't address the issue that most of ret's abilities are now insta-cast, so the swing time penalty is a non-issue while bubbled. Retribution used to rely on melee damage with some holy, but it has been shifted to holy damage with some melee - bubble should be adjusted accordingly since the penalty no longer has the weight it once had.<br />
<br />
No class should be able to become immune to all forms of damage while still doing that much damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Humm, no. That's burst damage. And there are other classes that get ridiculous &quot;immune&quot; while doing unbelievable damage. Nobody QQ about that (or QQ and Blizz don't care).<br />
<br />
Ret's abilities aren't instant cast &quot;spells&quot;, they're instant attacks and some of them where really stupid having a cast (like Hammer of Wrath. Would love arms Warriors casting execute and ALSO reseting their sloooooow swing time).<br />
<br />
And they're still heavy on physical damage. Don't cheat yourself thinking that DS is the same as every other attack (even some seal procs are considered physical, have you ever parried a fireball?!?! No). What you (and others) fail to notice is that now, blizzard finally had a clue on how to not let spellpower be a &quot;lolstat&quot;. Rets always had spellpower and their seals/judgements and other attacks use it. But since blizzard didn't want to fix that crap before, ret gear was always gimped by having spelldamage on it (and taking stat budget away). In 2.3, Blizzard decided to just throw spelldamage out (and thus, removing some of ret's damage) and compensate it with some resilience (that they never had) and str.<br />
<br />
Guess what? They finally decided to fix that. Bam, everything doing way more damage, or, if you prefer, the INTENDED damage that ppl couldn't get since itemization sucked a lot.<br />
<br />
Ret paladins aren't warriors, to rely only on physical damage. Wonder how blizzard will explain why they're removing most of the nerfs when ppl reach 80 and have new abilites + waaaay more HP and resilience... (while Ret paladins learned divine plea at 71 and nothing else all the way to 80). Probably ppl won't even care anymore, since ret pallys burst won't be able to catch the new HP/Res standard at 80, not even the beta rets.</div></div><hr />

No, you are completely wrong and those numbers are quite correct.<br />

Who gives a fuck about white damage TPS? In any situation that MATTERS, the tank is getting hit hard, therefore he has rage, therefore he should be doing excellent TPS (if he's a warrior). If the tank isn't getting hit hard, why does TPS matter?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newor</div><div class="date">2008-11-01, 08:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it just me or are the QQrs now yelling about having to think and choose between 2 baseline abilities that other classes have to talent for to get similar effects deep in their trees?<br />
<br />
You have a full immunity that still allows you near freedom of action, clears your debuffs etc. And you have a flat dps % increase button. Generally a class is punished for flat large dps increase. Shadowform=no heals, zerker stance= get hit harder, arcane power= mana(not to mention this to can be dispelled and stolen). Shadows version of bubble is 6secs 90% less damage, and can't cast, doesn't clear debuffs and can be CC'd. Mages can't move at all.<br />
<br />
Just because you have to choose now doesn't make your class broken, it just means that if you choose incorrectly, you will pay the price. Heaven forbid your choices have an effect on game play.<br />
<br />
I do think some ret nerfs were uncalled for and it does seem like you are getting picked on. I say give back some of your burst that was taken and let the AV/bubble change stay. I think that will fix stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does your stuff get dispelled/stolen just that easy?<br />
<br />
Guess no. And the real problem is that ppl just &quot;omg, he bubbled, i'm gonna sit here and wait for my death&quot;. Ppl always fought back those TWO abilities without a problem. Even the &quot;I.W.I.N.&quot; bubble button (pure stupidity in saying that) was and still is just laughable by every other class. (lol dispel, go wait 5 min again). &quot;Woot! Wings!&quot; and then &quot;Woot! Disarm! hahaha +30% dmg to your knuckles!&quot;.<br />

After all this shit and the upcomming ones that we can see comming, can't help but think that retribution players just bought a new x-pac to have old problems fixed. Instead of a new lvl 80, they will have a &quot;70 reloaded&quot;.<br />
<br />
Just a new attack (that they lack), gear itemization &quot;fixed&quot;, spelldamage fixed, seal/judgement fixed, need of spell crit/hit fixed by &quot;melee = spell&quot; and greater blesses vs. minor blesses (salv, fredoom, etc.) fixed.<br />
<br />
By the way, they downed AW to 20% 'cause you could use it anytime with/without bubble. Now that they decided to put it back the forbearance, where is the old 30%?</div></div><hr />

We do very extensive testing on all aspects of combat balance. Remember, as a large company we have access to testing capabilities far beyond that of the average player. As developers of the game, we also have access to a large number of tools that we don't make public.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dude, your testing is broken. There is no way you had tested ret pallys. Within 10 minutes on the very first day of play, it was clear that something was seriously wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think sometimes there is a misperception from players that we read the forums all day and when we see someone saying &quot;X is too good&quot; we nerf it and when &quot;Y is too bad&quot; we buff it. Forum feedback, while very helpful, is but a small percentage of our actual testing paradigm. (So is personal experience of that matter.)<br />
<br />
<br />
We get it. Player feedback in forums is ignored.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We do make mistakes sometimes, whether because of an undetected bug, or players falling into different spell rotations or gear that we predict, or a number of other reasons. But you generally don't need to worry that e.g. we forgot to test say paladins on non-undead targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ret pallys were not a bug. You just did a poor job. They could have 50% of their power and still own every other class and spec.</div></div><hr />

Every other class has counters. You're not gimped because you can be dispelled and disarmed. Maybe if you weren't retarded you would wait until they disarm, THEN pop your shit. Or CC the dispeller, or just beat on him, if he's spending all his time dispelling you (l2cover, he won't be able to get it off immediately) he isn't healing himself, which means he's going to die.<br />
<br />
I'll repeat this: YOU ARE NOT GIMPED JUST BECAUSE THERE ARE A FEW CLASSES THAT CAN SPEC ONE WAY AND BEAT YOU. IN FACT IT WOULD BE OVERPOWERED IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE COUNTERS, BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE HAS COUNTERS TOO. JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT EVERY OTHER CLASSES' COUNTER DOESN'T MEAN THOSE CLASSES ARE OVERPOWERED.</div></div><hr />

Uh, what? I can pull numbers out of my ass too. Druids can't block or parry, so you're saying druids have 70-80% dodge. Riiiiight.... With trinkets popped.<br />
(Also, gg @ diminishing returns now for druids.)<br />
<br />
See, right here, you have no f'n clue. I said total avoidance and block is not total avoidance therefore not included. Same reason why shield block % does not suffer from dim returns.<br />
Druids were routinely hitting 65%+ dodge then add in the 5% base and 3% more to be missed from the def they had to stack, all of a sudden my numbers aren't coming out of me ass anymore are they!<br />
Do your own research before making an ass of yourself please.<br />
At least you didn't try and debate their armor and health heh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who gives a fuck about white damage TPS? In any situation that MATTERS, the tank is getting hit hard, therefore he has rage, therefore he should be doing excellent TPS (if he's a warrior). If the tank isn't getting hit hard, why does TPS matter?<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't get it do you?<br />
Warriors couldn't stack too much avoidance and risk rage starving themselves because a prot warrior generates crap rage from white damage.<br />
A druid on the other hand would rarely suffer from or suffer less TPS loss from avoidance streaks because they generated much more rage and threat from their greater white damage and use less abilities to maintain it.<br />
<br />

1-2 warriors out of ALL those teams, still under represented.<br />
<br />
Again, you're confusing popular with the best or OP comps.<br />
<br />
Warrior, Druid, Lock won the 3v3 tournament from MLG, if i remember correctly, so I'd consider that a wash.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
See, right here, you have no f'n clue. I said total avoidance and block is not total avoidance therefore not included. Same reason why shield block % does not suffer from dim returns.<br />
Druids were routinely hitting 65%+ dodge then add in the 5% base and 3% more to be missed from the def they had to stack, all of a sudden my numbers aren't coming out of me ass anymore are they!<br />
Do your own research before making an ass of yourself please. At least you didn't try and debate their armor and health heh. <br />
Various warrior talents made up for the difference in armor. And you are pulling numbers out of your ass. I hit high 50s for dodge at the highest in my normal tanking gear. If I gemmed for pure avoidance, yes I could hit those numbers. But then my armor and health weren't that high, and I didn't have an INATE 10% DAMAGE REDUCTION. Feral tanking started to decline in late T5 territory, and further so in T6. So stop talking out your ass.<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't get it do you? Warriors couldn't stack too much avoidance and risk rage starving themselves because a prot warrior generates crap rage from white damage. A druid on the other hand would rarely suffer from or suffer less TPS loss from avoidance streaks because they generated much more rage and threat from their greater white damage and use less abilities to maintain it. <br />
<br />
You know nothing of how a druid tanks, so GTFO and do some research. If I'm causing substantial white damage on a boss, I'm failing. It's called Maul, it is the equivalent of your heroic strike. It should be used every melee swing. It depletes rage quickly. <br />
<br />
<br />
Like seriously, who the hell do you think you're arguing with, i have prolly been tanking longer than you have played this game lol. <br />
<br />
And yet, you are still an idiot who knows nothing of feral tanking. Go figure.<br />
<br />
Edit: When Druid Avoidance gets too high, EVERY HIT became a crushing blow, thus negating much of the benefit. Warriors blocked these incoming blows and prevented crushed but you knew that, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the blues do find a way to implement a fix that will lower ret's burst dmg in pvp to a normal level, I think that they should move Reckoning to the 11 point spot in the prot tree BUT in a way that if you really want to pvp you -can't- get it without sacrificing something vital for pvping. <br />
<br />
That way pve will stay strong vs monsters that have tons of hp and pvp will be normalized and won't frontload so much damage. <br />
<br />
Also, reckoning should not stack like it did right after patch 2.0 and should be a max of 10 or 15% chance to proc. 2 extra swings just like before but again only accessible at level 80 and for a serious pvp/raid retribution spec.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents though. <br />

Really, I 'hate' PvP as much as the next carebear, but realizing it's a part of the game is something you have to do.<br />
<br />
And with 'PvP' I mean of course the faction vs faction intercourse and battlegrounds, which both have so much potential yet left untouched by Blizzard, and not the joke called arenas.<br />
<br />
I just don't get the illusion people feel that both should be separated. PvE should not shun PvP, and neither should PvP, PvE.</div></div><hr />

However, they stay in their little rooms playing their mini games and I will play wow.<br />
<br />
thus i have no beef with them, they just dont play the same game as i do. The only reason I am a bit upset about the whiners from pvp is because those are the people that ended up getting their way and taking away the fun stuff for the others. <br />
<br />
Granted there are prob more pvp players now so financially for blizzard that makes sence to cator to them...<br />
<br />
But still. If they want to have a game purely for fighting each other, why not blizzard make a game based on the game WoW but something along the lines of &quot;Timeless Warfare, Heroes of Azeroth&quot; or something with plenty of arenas and BGs but with a stair stepping routine that made progression possible also. which, in turn, would lead more people back to playing WoW for more progression.<br />

Yes Warriors are POPULAR because they wear plate and have MS, does that mean they are OP...NO, there's a difference.<br />

Like seriously, who the hell do you think you're arguing with, i have prolly been tanking longer than you have played this game lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well i guess those teams should have learned to play, since they didn't have warriors on them and lost.<br />
<br />
Hypocrite much? First you say they're underrepresented even though they won the tournaments, then you say most popular does not equal best? Are you a fucking retard? Contrary to what your peabrain might think, simply disagreeing with everything that is said, even if you contradict yourself, does not prove the opposite point.<br />
<br />
Oh, warriors are popular because they have irreplaceable abilities and damage? Hmmm, well if something is overpowered I guess it stands to reason it would be popular to include that thing on your team. Moron.<br />
<br />
Did I say block and parry contribute to warrior's total avoidance? No, I just said Druids have neither. And Block is an extremely important part of tanking. Shield block and defensive stance magic reduction are the two main reasons that warriors have about the same mitigation for bosses as feral druids, DESPITE the druid being armor capped.<br />
<br />
A warrior MAINTANKING (that is the whole argument) is not going to have rage issues, even if he has high avoidance. Offtanking or tanking trash raids? Yes, you would be fucked there. But you don't need the avoidance there either.<br />
<br />
And feral druid white TPS is not OMGGODELIKE as you seem to think. Any decent DPSer needs a shitton more threat than white damage to keep aggro off him (remember we're talking about MAINtanking). So in either case, the druid with stacked avoidance or the warrior with stacked avoidance, the DPSers are going to have trouble with threat.<br />
<br />

There, highest agi in relatively tank gear I could find. 39% dodge. That (used to be) 43% in bear form (since we're talking 2.4, I didn't add 6%). So you're trying to tell me that kings, grace of air, and mark of the wild add 20-25% dodge? That would be 280-350 agi, impossible to reach. So yes, stop pulling numbers out of your ass and show some PROOF. (And btw, that guy would be an awful tank, his HP is complete shit. But he DID stack dodge. So OP, amirite?)<br />

Oh, hey look:<br />

<br />
You're looking at post patch numbers before dim returns were put in on avoidance and before how much druids got towards dodge from agility was reduced.<br />
Go find a SW geared druid tank somewhere and ask him what his dodge was pre 3.0, you're in for a shock.<br />
It was seriously something silly like 14.7 agil = 1% dodge.<br />
So now take the druid you linked, give him GoA +BK he now has over 850 agility.<br />
850/14.7= 58% dodge and that's just from his agility, no talents or dodge rating on gear added to it.<br />
Add in his 137 dodge rating for another 7.24%, add in his base 5% and then add in another 3% to be missed from the defense i garentee you he had pre 3.0 to finish being uncrittable...Oh look we're up to 73% total avoidance already and i haven't even added mark or a simple 20 agil scroll yet. Getting pretty damned close to that 80% i mentioned aren't we?<br />
Still pulling numbers from my ass? I THINK NOT!<br />
<br />
Oh and if Druids need to be hit as much as warriors do to gen enough rage/threat then tell me how a Druid could OT something, not take a lick of damage and be able to stay ahead of the DPS maintaining #2 agro within ear shot of the warrior tank...and don't tell me i suck either, i was pulling in sustained 1400+ TPS pre 3.0.<br />

Get a clue. Really. Ret Paladins crying over balance makes me laugh. If Rets don't understand they were ridiculous they they deserve anything they are getting and more. And yes, this is taking into account 80.<br />

<br />
Gc is just &quot;fireman&quot; from marketing terminology, it means he is person whos job is to take hits from customers, he is there also to try to calm down ppl when they know customers will not take information with calming sense.<br />
Obviously he wanna show ppl that he is also here to discuss about changes, as he have power or chance to act in dev department.<br />
Just look guys how he inform ppl about last hotfixes, in most casses he is last which is inform about that.<br />
Btw, he also said once how they test dps and bust in pvp, some of player sit down other guy hit him and they try to see how big numbers are(which have nothing about pvp).<br />
Agree with you, yes they says &quot;paladin was OP we nerfed him and again he is OP in pvp&quot; and nobody realy tested that in arena or in any other real player enveiroment.<br />
Other thing which shows how much they test, answer on question why Blizz dont hire more ppl, Gc tried to look as joker and avoided real answer, what if Blizz hire more ppl does it would affect on better balancing on faster changes between classes.<br />
He can say, write, make jokes, being in touch with customers but he will stay &quot;fireman&quot;, person which is hired to calm masses of customers and nothing more, dont excpect miracle ONLY cause blizz start to hire guy which will be allways in contact with customers.<br />

I want to know an endgame raiding guild that progressed through BT/Sunwell with a feral druid MT.<br />
<br />
And sure, that druid has pretty high dodge. But his HP is completely unsuited for MTing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does base dodge have to do with anything i said?<br />
The base i was talking about was everyone's base 5% to be missed.<br />
At least you are finally seeing that my quoted 70-80% total avoidance was not BS.<br />
Oh and these 70%+ total avoidance druids were still running over 20k health raid buffed.<br />
Also, Mark and scrolls do indeed stack.<br />
<br />
It was even confirmed by a blue that the SW debuff was mainly aimed at druid tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So people who have been playing paladins since release are now &quot;flotm&quot; players. Riiiiiiight.<br />
<br />
Btw, which classes? B/c if it is a rogue or drood or mage (who can spec arcane) I get to make a baseless accusations about you playing a flotm class.<br />
<br />
Pay a bit of attention to what Blizzard does and you'll see why competent ret-paladins are pissed. They will hotfix us, nerf us, change our tooltips, and basically gut our class/spec w/o regard to the consequences to our PvE and PvP AND ALSO cleave prot and holy w/o regard to their problems BUT they claim they can't fix arcane PvP burst (which they have admitted is too high and double arcane is dominating 2s btw) because it would require hotfixing a few spells and this would invalidate their tooltips. OH NOES! MAGE TOOLTIPS ARE WRONG?! WHATEVER SHALL WE DO?<br />
<br />

Ret Paladins crying over balance makes me laugh. If Rets don't understand they were ridiculous they they deserve anything they are getting and more. And yes, this is taking into account 80.<br />
<br />
And please... the game haven't ended, more patches will come, more balacing, more nerfs, more buffs for every class. And no, Ret Paladins not even after nerfs are weak, far from it. If you're trying to compare 3.02 Paladins after the Nerfs to Paladins Pre-3.02... you're a moron Sir. ::)<br />
<br />
Oh and if you think that every melee class has MS effect or... if they answer to balance is add MS to Paladins, you give me even more reasons to call understand your post and whinning.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes we did need nerfs, but not this much, at 80 we are not balanced at all, don't start this bulls**t here.<br />
If you had a semblance of a clue, you would know, that the WWS parses coming out are showing how grave it actually is. A paladin has to resort to Dark Runes and pots yet again for mana, and it's exceedingly dangerous using SoB in such close range to a boss and with total reliance on someone else to heal you, as we can no longer afford to heal even with our exorbitantr mana pools at 70 (which we wont have at 80, people didnt want to listen to this either, just &quot;NERF RET! NERF RET! over and over and over, well I hope your happy you have destroyed the classes dps talent tree yet again)<br />
On live for example (and bare in mind i've played paladins for 3+ years and am raiding T6 content and am in the top 3-8 damage dealers before patch 3.0.2, I know my stuff) I was topping the dps by a country mile the first two weeks of patch, now my dps is around the same as everyone else without the JotW, AoW, RV and SW and seal changes. This will pretty much shaft us over at 80, the flattening out of our seals for one, and the non scaling of the other deep ret talents is abysmal. Not so bad at 70 for PvE (for which they are obviously balancing around as per usual, the current f**kin level at which we get all of or abilities, just as we did at 60 last time and we were overnerfed for 2 fricken years, only for it too happen yet again, these people designing this game seriously are clueless). <br />
PvP at 70 we are already seeing the effects of the DS nerf etc on live, I mean when a frost/arcane mage can interupt you, freeze you in place and proceed to three shot me every single time I come up against one, why isn't Blizzard doing somethign about this? Nothing has been mentioned, it happens every time I come up against a mage, every single time without fail. We don't have enough burst to kill a mage now, the bloody mage armour absorbs all the damage and they blink out of our only gap closer our HoJ, interrupt, kite and 4 shot - easy mode still. Hunters are just as devastating.<br />
I'd hate to see PvP at 80, it's back to square one for paladins and Ret in particular. A shaman healer laughed at me at 70 the other day and fully absorbed all attacks and had 50% mana in the end and full health, I just ran out of mana as per usual &quot;trying&quot; to burst him down, so if people think Ret paladins are still OP, the only one kidding themselves is you, your just a s**thead who wants Ret to be at lame levels as it was before, and that is certainly not a balanced game at all, by any stretch of the imagination. We dont have a gap closer, we dont have a reliable interupt, because our interupt is our gap closer and so we cant shut anyone down when if we ever do get close enough, we dont have a healing debuff, and now we dont even have any self sufficiency in our damage dealing resource in the form of mana, no other melee class has this problem, we may have a slight surplus of around 16mp5 in PvE if we use SoB and get heals and have all, and I mean all mana regen utilities at our disposal, in PvP we are a glutton for punishment yet again, easily mana burnable and when we are oom, we are oom, there is nothing we can do to recover, we should have had a similar mana regen mechanic to shaman at least where every hit has a chance to restore it, not one spell.<br />
Anyway our only hope is that these main items come to light to the devo's and they change some of it back to a more balanced place in the end, not where it is now, it's far too much.<br />
<br />

Locks and now ret pally's are on the same page.<br />

They were both buffed and were OP, they take nerfs so they are less OP but still in the neighborhood just less OP than they were, they QQ hard but get some more nerfs so they are even less OP but still a lil OP, they QQ more in hopes of keeping some part of their OPness.<br />
<br />
Like my god, do you remember the QQ out of locks when they couldn't simply spam drain life on a any warrior in any gear level and win easily anymore?<br />
It was pure silliness heh.<br />
It's the same crap coming from ret pallies now, OMG I can't waste 10 people in a row without dieing or running out of mana. LOL I say.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the classes that are UP (under powered) get lost in all the OP classes' QQ.<br />
<br />
Locks were a joke pre BC, they got buffed to crazy levels then nerfed back down to respectibility.<br />
The exact same thing is happening to Pallies now.<br />
Pallies you got little to QQ about, i'm sorry but you don't.<br />
Even with all these nerfs, you're still 10 times better than you were and STILL more powerfull than the majority of the other classes...seriously wtf is your problem? lol<br />
[/quote/] Know your shit bro obviously ya dont. 70 matters nothing 80 is the big picture. There are 2 more rounds of nerfs on the way to palis and wotlk isn't even fucking out.80 is the big picture qqin about now is meaningless.</div></div><hr />

I rolled a Paladin because I enjoy the idea of a Holy Defender. I like the flexibility of having three unique specs. I did not roll a Paladin to have a gimp spec. Just because I occasionally want to DPS does not mean I want to level another class. It means I want my DPS spec to do damage.<br />

We also spend a lot more time with the game than many players are capable of doing, and can look up numbers or gather data that most players have to estimate or guess at. All of this experience probably puts us in the upper percentiles of player skill. Nevertheless, we don't pretend to be the best players in the world in all aspects of WoW, nor do I think that is necessary to do our jobs. We do employ experts on all classes in both PvE and PvP and as a reality check to our own testing, we are also in contact with expert players of the classes throughout the world.

<br />
First, a Rogue is generally more squishy then a Paladin. It's MUCH easier to pick off a Rogue that's going for the kill then a Paladin is in a BG. <br />
<br />
Second, A Rogue's burst is completely mitigated by Armor; it's all but completely ineffective against Plate Armor. Retribution Paladins do primarily Holy Damage, which cannot be resisted by Players. Period.<br />
<br />
Also, Rogues can't increase all their damage by 20% while becoming immune to everything WITH the ability to heal themselves.<br />

Ret Paladins were WAY overpowered when compared to Rogues, and this is coming from a Paladin who has a Rogue alt &gt;.&gt;.</div></div><hr />

Your paladin is a main and you make comments like that?? Please. List the damage dealing abilities paladins have. You know. I'll do it for you, I'm not sure you can pull it off.<br />
<br />
Non-holy Damage<br />
White hits<br />
Crusader Strike<br />
Divine Storm<br />
<br />
Holy Damage<br />
Soc Procs (not guaranteed)<br />
JoC<br />
Hammer of Wrath (20% and under)<br />
Consecrate (wth stands in it?)<br />
Exorcism (demo locks only)<br />
Holy Wrath (demo locks only)<br />
<br />
So, if you were speaking in terms of sheer quantity then yes, a Retribution Paladin mainly deals holy damage. If you were talking about actual DPS output then no, he does not.<br />
<br />
Second, a paladin cannot become immune to everything with 20% dmg/healing bonus and deal damage and heal himself. He has to choose to either heal or attack. Also, with the nerf, he no longer even gets to do bubble + wings.<br />
<br />
Third, aside from bubble + trinket, a paladin is completely at the mercy of a rogues CC abilities. If the rogue saves trinket for HoJ they are able to ignore our CC. If we repentance they can sit it out without us doing damage.<br />
<br />

When they bubble they shouldn't be able to do much damage (since it's a defensive ability) and HoJ also needs to be a much shorter stun considering the damage they can do during it and it's not even comparable to rogue stuns since they need timing and a certain skill level (and manage their energy) to pull of perfectly.

Do you write fail posts for fun?<br />
<br />
Rogue stuns take skill? Lol. CS + KS + Blind (if KS was trinketed) + Vanish + Sap + REPEAT! ZOMOGOSH SKILL! If anything since a Paladin is limited to 1 stun he has to be more careful and situational in its use. (btw, if you are whining about BGs no one cares. PvP means arena now)<br />

Paladins are not supposed to go OOM during their melee DPS rotation in PVE. A ret-paladin going OOM during a raid using their regular rotation would be like a warrior running out of rage or a rogue running out of energy. In PvP a ret-paladin will run oom without too much effort.<br />
<br />
Holy magic has the base chance to resist like every other type of magic.<br />

When they bubble they shouldn't be able to do much damage (since it's a defensive ability) and HoJ also needs to be a much shorter stun considering the damage they can do during it and it's not even comparable to rogue stuns since they need timing and a certain skill level (and manage their energy) to pull of perfectly. A HoJ takes absolutely no skill whatsoever and lasts for 7 secs with the glyph.<br />
<br />
Also, have you ever seen a ret that is oom? Well I haven't. Blizz said that they shouldn't go oom from using their core abilities; if that is the case then neither should the rest of the mana using classes.<br />
Imagine if mages could spam their spells and never go oom, the whining on the boards would be immense yet it's perfectly alright for rets to never go oom. How is that balanced?<br />
<br />
And how come the only magic that cant be resisted is holy magic? Again, how balanced is that? Imagine if there were no resists against shadow magic for instance. Yet again there would be alot of whining.<br />

Bring ret in line and do it now.<br />

wow, i do not normally post, but an avid reader, but i had to seeing this post.<br />
<br />
how dumb can u be??? do u realize that a HUGE difference between a ret pally and any other type of caster is the cd's on EVERY SINGLE ONE of their abilities? If a frost mage could only cast frostbolt once every 6-8 secs, then yeah, he could prob go a very long time w/o going oom. If abilities like slam or sinister strike had a 6-8 sec cool down u would always have enough rage/energy to do them, right? but they dont so u can spam them and have to worry bout running out of rage/energy.<br />
<br />
i also have a shaman who used to be enhancmenet. i cant tell u about since 3.0, but pre 3.0 i NEVER ran oom. anytime i ever got below bout 1/3 mana, i would hit shamanistic rage and bring myself back up to full mana. So why was i able to do this, maybe because for my auto attack, my other main dps ablities (shock/storm strike) both had cooldowns.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ret paladin's should be nerfed back to what they were like 2 mounth's ago!!! Because really thank about it if stupid people like ParaDaMan saying that rogues should get nerfed dude come on thank about it rogue's are useing leather not plate with 10 thousand armor rogues cant hit threw that!!! And rogues got there nerf a million of them they got cheat death nerfed and lets see hemo got nerfed and mm lets me thank agian blade flurry got it so stfu and stop QQ PW PW about rogue and deal with your bad class all of a sudden being better than warrior's!!!<br />
<br />
<br />

Nice way of avoiding almost every single point in my post. I guess people just want to be OP and lack every sense of fairness.<br />
<br />
For the record, I have all classes at 70 except shaman and none of them are even close to ret palas in imbalance.</div></div><hr />

Because people on the beta say that things are the same at 80 and the fact that Blizz has a bad track record of fixing classes that are imbalanced for a long time?</div></div><hr />

LOL. So Paladins were OP for what, 2 weeks tops. And during those 2 weeks Blizzard was shelling out hotfixnerf after hotfixnerf and you want MORE? Please.<br />
<br />
If anything Blizzard has a bad track record of fixing resto droods and sub rogues. Paladins they are all over like white on rice.</div></div><hr />

If you are a paladin, ever spec'd ret, and say you have no survivability, stop reading right now, your opinion is worthless.<br />
<br />
Ret Paladin's have some of the greatest survivability in the game. First off they wear plate, meaning melee people see a huge hit to their damage. They can also wear a shield if they really wanted to (sure it hurts damage a ton, but that's not the point; the point is it's more survivability options). Then they can bubble and toss up decent heals or whack you with their abilities, insta-heal themselves, insta-fully heal themselves now with no penalty but a mana gain instead, stun you several times, run faster than you, and STILL have a pot ready for use. There's also the blessing of lol-no-snares and cleanse. <br />
<br />
Very few classes match the survivability of paladins, save maybe rogues. But that's all good. Paladin's are meant to have a lot of survivability. The problem started when Paladins could start putting out insane damage on top of their survivability. Paladins were the top of the DPS world for those brief two weeks, and it wasn't because of skill. No one came close to the damage output of Ret. Even now I see undergeared paladins rocking damage meters in raids. In PvP, Ret Paladins are still to be feared. Sure you can't kill someone as quickly, but you still kill them pretty quick, plus you still have your survivability.<br />

You seem confused. Ret paladin's aren't casters. They're melee with the ability to cast, aka a hybrid. The distinct difference is melee have to be within melee range for their core damaging abilities and auto-attack, while casters can be out of melee range. True, some of a paladin's skills have range on them (hence the hybrid part), but the core damaging abilities of a paladin are in melee range, for ret at least. Another huge difference between Ret and casters is mobility. Most Ret abilities are instant, meaning you can run around and use them. Most caster spells have a cast or channel time, meaning you have to stand still while you cast them or you break the spell and it won't go off. Casters do have some instant casts as well, but these are usually on CD, as well. This is why you cannot compare pally abilities to frostbolt. Pallies also have white damage from their auto-attack going. Casters have no such extra damage. And let's not confuse dots with auto-attacks. If you do, you're lol. <br />
<br />
On Ret ability cooldowns. If blizzard didn't put your abilities on CD you would just spam one the ENTIRE TIME. It's not meant for your mana to regen, it's not meant to gimp you in anyway; It's to keep you from pressing the same damned button over and over again. You can usually kill someone before your abilities run out anyway. If you don't, your first ability is up by the time your last ability's GCD is up. Anyway, if you have to run to your next opponent, chances are by the time you get there your CDs will be up again. I don't see how this is so bad seeing as all your abilities are instant. <br />
<br />
No, if a frost mage could only frostbolt every 6-8 seconds they would STILL go oom seeing as normal mana regen only resumes every 6 seconds after you finish a cast and inbetween the frostbolts you would be ice lancing and CoC'ing, possible sheeping, CSing, Blinking etc. Mages don't get down time during a fight. You can try to create some, but mostly no. The reason why Rets don't go oom isn't because of the 6-8 second CD on their abilities, it's the massive regen tweaking that Blizzard did.<br />
<br />
As for your shaman, unless I am mistaken, the majority of your damage comes from Windfury, not your shocks/Stormstrike. Shocks/SS are there to provide support for your WF, ie extra damage because it doesn't stop your swing timer and giving you the extra AP/crit/damage and whatnot. The difference between your shaman and ret paladins are this, your shaman actually got to 1/3 of his mana bar. Rets do not. It's that simple.</div></div><hr />

Ok, point #1.<br />
<br />
Paladin burst was super nerfed. We no longer have insane burst. Paladin dps is still very high. Guess why? Because you are missing the point that we do not get any more +damage talents / spells / abilities between now and 70. The dps/burst you see now is the exact same dps/burst you will be seeing @ 80. Basically every other class will be able to spec into new +dmg talents and will be receiving new damage dealing abilities and skills.<br />

I do not understand the point of this paragraph. I could sum up my feelings with &quot;duh&quot;<br />

Mages have evoc (which with glyph is pretty much a full heal + full mana now) and mana gems. If a mage cannot kill you with that much mana I do not know what to say.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Ret mana was super-nerfed with the 33% --&gt; 15%. Also we will be losing all of our +int when we level.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: Your post was a long and basically pointless list of abilities without any substantial meaning. Try condenscing your argument to a paragraph or 2 that does not involve outdated information. kthnks</div></div><hr />

Please read the above post about how 70 ret pally basically = 80 ret pally.<br />
<br />
And seriously... AV? Could you use an example that actually has meaning please? Current &quot;end-game&quot; raiding (does not exist currently) or current top-end PvP (arena, does not exist currently).</div></div><hr />
