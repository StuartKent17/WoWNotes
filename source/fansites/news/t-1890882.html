<br />
I'd wager most people that were sick of the game in its current state (for whatever the reason) already left (taking a break, quitting, &quot;quitting&quot;, whatever :-P), and most people that are left are still enjoying what they have to work with. Doesn't mean it would last forever, I just expect further dropoffs until the next announcement/expansion to be relatively light. <br />
<br />
If the Blizzcon announcements are received well, I wouldn't be particularly surprised to see numbers go back up as people come back to prep for Legion. *shrug*</div></div><hr />

The only reason I'm still subbed is because I have 5 level 100s all with treasure hunter followers who between them gather between 5k to 12k gold each day. I won't have to worry about gold ever again thanks to WoD.</div></div><hr />

This. I would rather see an activity chart than a subscriber count. That would be far more telling of the actual state of the game.</div></div><hr />

The token definitely has a hand in it, but I also think people underestimate the amount of people who don't completely hate WoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say theres a difference between hating WoD and actually having things to do. I liked WoD, they fucked up a looot of things but it wasnt that bad when you just turn off and play. But I ran out of stuff pretty fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yuppp.. While people rage about 'no content' there's plenty of people who still haven't completed everything for the expansion they set goal wise.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SniperCT</div><div class="date">2015-11-03, 04:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone: It's gonna drop by the millions!!!<br />
Blizzard: -100k<br />
Everyone: Look at that huge drop! The game is tanking!<br />
<br />
I mean 4.5 million over the course of the expansion is pretty bad but I was honestly expecting much higher this quarter. <br />
<br />
Ever since the game started losing subs, only two other times has the drop been as low as 100k. Typically the drop is closer to 300k it looks like.<br />
<br />
Taking into account how badly WoD gets slammed, losing only an extra 100k people in Q3 is actually really good.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't that go for free to play games like League Of Legends too? Accounts =/= activity</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yep. Now that I have flying, it's finally time to get out into the world and do things like archaeology, and quest achievements. I wouldn't necessarily say 'enjoy' the game, but it's something new to do, that I didn't really work on without flying.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
WoW cannot die no matter how much you want it to. There are still millions of loyal players that will never give up.<br />
<br />
This is probably gonna be the last time you see a sub loss for awhile so enjoy it while you can. <br />

See you when you re-sub for Legion you haters, cuz we all know you will. ;)</div></div><hr />

If I had to guess I'd say that some people returned that quiet in Q2. Not because of the content because there isn't any new content but because in Q2 a lot of students leave and people who go on holidays. In Q3 a new study year starts, summer is over etc. people want to play a game. I'm expecting the Q4 drop to be bigger but I might be wrong. Being &quot;stable&quot; at 5.5 mil is still a very good number considering the state the game is in.</div></div><hr />

I very much doubt that, pretty sure we will see a subscriber increase around the time of Legion coming out. Probably nowhere near how it was at WoD release, but still an increase. If you instead meant something like a few weeks to a month before legion pre patch then yes, around 5 mil is probably likely, if not lower.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your point is so bad, your logic so flawed.<br />
<br />
breakdown:<br />
<br />
Person A bought a Wow token.<br />
blizzard got their sub fee +50%.<br />
person A put the WoW token on the AH.<br />
person B(you) paid X gold to buy that token.<br />
you used the token to gain 30 days sub time.<br />
<br />
you are currently subbed to the game in a method that transfers gold from 1 account to another and actually gives blizzard MORE cash than if you paid via your own cash.<br />
<br />
from a statistical PoV you are 1 player subbed to the game, you are 1 sub.<br />
from a profit point of view you should actually count as 1.5 subs!<br />
<br />
anyone who has an ounce of business savvy in them should realise token players are even better than standard subs, and the people selling those gold tokens on the AH are a gold mine.</div></div><hr />

It's relevant to investors, who will be very intrigued at how much attention/revenue Overwatch, as a new IP, will generate.<br />

Acti-blizz Stock has trended upward for years now, and things like Hearthstone (gold from heaven) only drive investment up.</div></div><hr />

If you activate your account with a token, its counted as a sub. It doesnt matter that tokens are bought in game with gold because someone paid $20 dollars to sell the token in game.</div></div><hr />

i agree, SoO was out far too long, but this wasn't MoPs fault as much as blizzard too fucking slow to get WoD ready for release, then WoD lacked content, basically blizzard spent too long training new staff and didn't actually produce anything while they were training staff.</div></div><hr />

Hey, they stayed at 7 million during the content drought of MoP.<br />

It's not totally unexpected.<br />

If we want to somehow take WoW tokens into account better, we should count them as 1,33 subs. (So as normal subs WoW could be considered having over 6mil subs probably.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll give you WoD but MoP bad in content? Did we play the same game? Pound for pound MoP had arguably the MOST content of any expansion to date. Just because most of it was dailies does not invalidate it. There were a ton of questlines after the initial leveling experience that were actually pretty awesome in the grand scheme of things.<br />
<br />
OT: I am shocked it isn't more. I was sure that more people would have left but I guess everyone who was going to leave has already left. Going to be interesting to see what Q4 looks like.</div></div><hr />

Probably nowhere near how it was at WoD release, but still an increase. If you instead meant something like a few weeks to a month before legion pre patch then yes, around 5 mil is probably likely, if not lower.<br />
<br />
Maybe I didn't word it right. Q4 is what I meant as by the end of that, many people will have burned out (but still willing to come back). Maybe even Q1 2016, but I don't know because they haven't announced a release date yet for Legion. My main point is just that in previous end-of-expansion times, we've seen some sizable losses (300-500k). <br />
<br />
With no planned major content to be released until Legion, and with many speculating a Q2 or Q3 2016 launch, we can probably expect to see about a 5-10% loss as we've seen during previous content drought times (ceteris paribus).</div></div><hr />

there's so few of us who actually understand about business and profit it's quite scary, i mean i'm not allowed to call people 12 year olds or retards, but you do have to wonder what is going on in their head where they believe blizzard making more money for every token sub vs non gold sub is bad lol.<br />

yup and at the end of the day blizzard is a business, if they have 100 million people not playing their servers but giving them $20 a month, who cares buy a bigger luxury yatch because you're a damn genius!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's incredibly good business wise, the only question is why they didn't do it sooner.<br />
<br />
People who don't want to pay to play don't have to, so they get a customer they would have lost otherwise.<br />
People who have money to spend and want to buy an easier ticket can do so.<br />
<br />
It's like Hearthstone's &quot;free-to-play&quot; model, effectively the people who buy packs subsidize the players who don't.<br />
<br />
I mean, it might be &quot;cheating&quot; if someone who would have quit had there been a sub ended up playing because of the token, but I'd say that's more &quot;good customer retention&quot; than &quot;cheating&quot;</div></div><hr />

It's a matter of perspective. 100K lost is certainly better than the 500K-2000K that people were thinking. It's not great either but it could have been a lot worse. <br />
<br />
Less than 2% at the end of the day/quarter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MoP absolutely was not bad content wise. Quality and quantity was there until after 5.4. If WoD didn't have development issues and MoP only lasted the intended 21 months(10 months of 5.4) I could safely call MoP the best expansion for WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Having only two raid tiers is going to be pushing it unless they're getting Legion out incredibly quick next year, and even then I'd be left wondering why I paid MORE for this expansion than the others, yet got less content and less time out of it before the next one, which no doubt costs as much, is released.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been the only company that I've always bought Collectors Edition boxes of, but between the lack of content in recent expansions alongside rising prices and how it feels almost punishing to buy a physical copy since they refuse to let shops mail out the keys early so you can play on release, I'm not sure why I continue to do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
NAH, probably just Legion hype.<br />
<br />
Idk, people thought we did with the stagnation of WoW in MoP. Only 2m have left in 2 years since then. That one guys graph of 250k lost per quarter average over the last 6 years is surprisingly accurate. In 1 year time if it is, Subs will be at 4.5m. That would require an even sharper loss after Legion unless it doesnt pull a lot of people in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if they're capable of fudging the numbers, wouldn't they fudge them on something that matters? Like when they dropped a couple million earlier this year. They didn't fudge it then, and that's a pretty huge loss.</div></div><hr />

If you look at the activity graph engagement had a decent spike up once October hit. No idea why. Hallows end? What happened in October? It looks like it happened in very late Sept-early oct and then plummeted back down at the end of Oct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Point: this number is probably not completely indicative of how many people are actually playing the game still.<br />

It really doesn't. Money talked. They make more from tokens then actual subs. Player activity graphs show almost identical activity levels to the end of MoP when there was more than 1m more players playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep just like Q3 was supposed to be right? History shows that Q4 is allways good for sub numbers. <br />
<br />
Q4 2011-WoW loses 100k subs<br />
Q4 2012-WoW loses 400k subs <br />
Q4 2013-WoW gains 200k subs<br />
Q4 2014-WoW subs the same.<br />
<br />
2011 showed Dragon Soul<br />
2012 had MoP in September<br />
2013 had SoO in September<br />
2014 had WoD in November<br />
<br />
Sure they had something big every time, but im not wrong subs stayed strong for the last 4 holiday quarters of WoWs life. Q4 2015 will have 6.2.3 which isnt big, but still a good minor patch and since that isnt getting any builds on the ptr im guessing it will have legion prelaunch stuff in it as well. <br />
<br />
Q4 loses less than 700k subs is my guess. A higher loss this time due to no major patch, but not too bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't accurately judge this on the data provided. With the introduction of tokens it is impossible to actually gauge the paying subscriber base and thus true retention unless the data is given separately. <br />
<br />
With how you can generate in game currency and the variation in peoples time vs money paradigm, those who would not pay cash can stay subbed via in game methods (who may otherwise leave) because they have a huge pool of gold to dip into and there are others who struggle to generate gold and thus buy tokens to sell.<br />
<br />
Ultimately it's another one of blizzard marketing gimmicks as per usual timed very well with content drought. Previous methods include annual pass, diablo etc. Say what you want about blizzard, they are fantastic as setting up the false numbers. <br />
<br />
Ultimately it doesn't matter either way because blizzard have been operating a micro transaction model for some time now across their products which has seen profits smashing it and that's really what shareholders care about. Sub numbers could be non existent so long as the cash flow is there they are happy.</div></div><hr />

I have to go with the numbers are legit and this information was leaked by accident. I'm shocked that that's all that was lost, Id have to guess we hit a floor, for now at least. My experience with floors tell me they bounce around, Id guess it will stabilize there +/- 50k until legion hits, but after legions numbers go up, that floor should be smashed to pieces once it goes there again. I expect +200k for Christmas, because I expect RAF.</div></div><hr />

Using a token puts you in the same category as a pre-paid time card &quot;subscription&quot;, although it has a different name. Look at your account page for your Subscription Type. Anyone who had cancelled should have &quot;CANCELLED&quot; as a subscription type, UNLESS they've used a token. It ceases to be a cancelled (or expired) status and becomes that token subscription (can't remember what it's called).<br />
<br />
When all those players came back from cancellation to try out flying in September (my guess is a million or so people fit this criteria), they probably bought a token to do so. This meant that there were at least a million token subscriptions counted for the Q3 results, which included September.<br />
<br />
Are they still actually playing now in November?<br />
<br />
If you want to ruminate on the number of active PLAYERS right now, not active subs, my guess is around the 3.5 million mark at best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW cannot die no matter how much you want it to. There are still millions of loyal players that will never give up.<br />
<br />
This is probably gonna be the last time you see a sub loss for awhile so enjoy it while you can. <br />
<br />
See you when you re-sub for Legion you haters, cuz we all know you will. ;)<br />
<br />
Sorry WoW won't be around forever. <br />
Blizzard dropped the ball on a lot of things with WoW.<br />
<br />
I'm not a hater by any means. Calling anybody who criticizes the status quo a hater doesn't help anybody because an entire expansion worth of Blizzard dismissing feedback while stroking their ego with fanboy rhetoric got us here. <br />
<br />
I expected a modest increase in Q3 due to a combination of gold tokens and people moving towards indoor entertainment with summer ending and also legion announcement. <br />
<br />
So yeah. Down 100k despite considerable damage control measures. If Q4 sees another loss don't be surprised if legion is the second to last expansion.</div></div><hr />

With how you can generate in game currency and the variation in peoples time vs money paradigm, those who would not pay cash can stay subbed via in game methods (who may otherwise leave) because they have a huge pool of gold to dip into and there are others who struggle to generate gold and thus buy tokens to sell.<br />
<br />
<br />
You cannot really discredit them those subs. They were paid. Hell, they were paid about 33% more than the usual sub price is, so if anything these subs are actually more valuable than the usual ones. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong. Someone has to actually pay for those tokens for them to even be buyable for gold. And in that sense, they are making even more money on it since they are going at a higher price than regular subs.<br />
<br />
1) Person A buys a token for x $<br />
2) Person A puts the token up for sale<br />
3) Person B buys the token for in-game gold<br />
<br />
If noone does step 1, there are no tokens to buy in-game.<br />

With what logic? The movie will be released in 2016 and then we get Legion in 2016. If you did not notice, the cast of the movie contains the following:<br />
<br />
- Llane Wrynn - who is not alive during MAIN universe and he is Varian's Grandfather.<br />
- Varian Wrynn - whos is not alive during ALTERNATIVE universe but only in main universe (meaning, he did not live in age of Warcraft 1), he &quot;meets&quot; his grandfather.<br />
<br />
Same stuff happened with Thrall. He found his father, Durotan, in Warlords of Draenor and he does not know the world of Draenor. This short facts shows that the story in the movie is still about alternative universe and Gul'dan, which is as well in the cast. <br />
<br />
What we get in 2016? Legion. <br />
Who is a boss in Suramar? Gul'dan. <br />

Yes but the point is, thus far, that we do not know if 'Token' players were included in those 'Subscriber' figures. I think it would also be misleading to include the [Token] figures *without clarification*.<br />

I highly doubt 3.5 million people are paying for a subscription that they are not using.<br />
The 1,9 million &quot;active accounts&quot; are the accounts that MMOchamp scrapes on the US/EU armory, not the total active worldwide accounts.<br />
<br />
The 5,5 million subs reported are worldwide, and include the asian realms where people pay by the hour not by the month, so they can stop playing and start playing and not worry about cancelling (they're &quot;subbed&quot; if they log in once during the quarter, even if they spent 0,01$ in connection times).<br />
<br />
Remember that Blizzard said repeatedly that most of the variation comes from asian realms where people are not really subscribed with monthly payments.</div></div><hr />

I would have quit WOW for good, but still play every few months just because it is free. But here is the thing.. for ever person like me, there is another person who is so dedicated to the game that they are willing to spend real money just to have extra gold in the game.<br />

Also, I don´t think there are nearly as many tokens sold per month as people imagine. The price would be much higher.</div></div><hr />

People really don't know what a simple money transfer for a paid service for someone else represents. They are paying 33%! more (Thats 133%!) for game time and people are still arguing, that it isn't real game time? If i were Blizzard, i would count those subs as 1.3 subs as they are. But well that's not what this chart is about. Activision Blizzard is a publicly traded company, they have to release reports each quarter for their holders. Imagine what would happen if it would come out that they forged their numbers so some haters on mmo-champion wouldn't lose their shit for a substantial drop in subscriptions?<br />
<br />
Seriously guys, i am no fanboy of this game, i don't even play it but i like informing myself about it as i would possibly return at any given point. I always read the comment sections on those drops but never was i so angry about the stupidity of people as to write a comment (or maybe once before, i dunno). I even saw a guy saying &quot;YA, but me and all of my guild are using tokens and are not playing. THAT DOES NOT MEAN WE ARE HAPPY BUT STILL WE ARE IN THE STATISTIC&quot;... It struck me there, people are interpreting this thing as a happy o'meter, they don't see it as a business tool for stock holders, it reflects somehow their stance to the game.

If you use a token you have a running subscription so you are a subscriber. This graph shows the amount of subscribers. I really don't see the issue people are having here, it's quite clear.<br />
<br />
Only a 100k drop is VERY suprising to me. Flying and valor upgrades might somehow gotten players excited to play again and maybe there are a lot of subscribers who are inactive but used their stockpile of gold to keep their subscription running.

Clarification beind the keyword here. In the end it's still all about the money.<br />

So shouldn't these numbers be clarified and actually weighted (With a weight of more than 1.0)? Someone is actually paying the token to keep this subscription going, and he is paying quite handsomely.</div></div><hr />

No idea why. Hallows end? What happened in October? It looks like it happened in very late Sept-early oct and then plummeted back down at the end of Oct.<br />
<br />
Hallow's End, Brewfest and Timewalking are all stuff that adds something meaningful and fun to do for a lot of players. Some nice light gameplay with mostly cosmetic rewards that breaks up the otherwise monotonous gameplay.<br />
Brewfest in particular is just a solid event. That area was just packed with other people and it's the first time in a long while that the game actually felt like an MMO. This year it had some new items to collect and it has 2 mounts that will pretty much ensure it stays relevant.</div></div><hr />

Just guessing here - people can be still subbed but don't play anymore (be it via in-game token or i.e. sub plan) I forgot to cancel sub to my daughter so she was subscriber while she haven't played for 3 months. I guess if people stop interest to play, they cancel but their sub can still run for some time.</div></div><hr />

Think about a gold fee alternative to buy flight in WoD, Blizz. If you want to save WoW that is, and haven't deliberately relegated it onto the MMO scrap heap while Overwatch, Hearthstone and, eh, Candy Crush get all of the dev love now.</div></div><hr />

And also, the life cycle seems normal, things just look bad since the subs increased ridiculously at the beginning of WoD. It was obvious most people would only stay for a month or two.

I used to have that money back in wotlk when mother kindly supplied me with free money but now I am a grown man and my salary alone is not enough. I imagine I am not the only one in this position. Star Wars The Old Republic found a way to flourish in a free to play environment by locking certain features requiring money to unlock and otherwise people are free to do as they please.

I don't find the amount of subs a good indicator to the overall activity in the game, since I know that a lot of people only keep subbed with the tokens while they only log in for a few minutes to do garrison missions.

We're just down to the diehard fans and folk who cant be fucked unsubbing and instead just let their sub run idle without actually doing anything.<br />

Stab a coke bottle and it'll piss out steadily for a while and then start to slow down/stop. Nothing's changed in wod, we're just running out of people to loose<br />

WoW won't run out of people to lose until there aren't any players left - excluding the developers themselves.<br />

<br />
WoW won't run out of people to lose until there aren't any players left - excluding the developers themselves.<br />
The only way there will be no players left is if Blizzard shuts the game down, and they're not goint to do that. It wasn't that long ago that Metzen discussed the idea of WoW eventually becoming a legacy service, saying that he wants it to be a place that players can always come back to, no matter how long it's been since they left.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has shown time and again that they're increasingly okay with WoW having a shrinking player base, and that they want to move away from being &quot;the World of Warcraft company.&quot; That's why they're expanding their portfolio. Frankly, it's not just WoW; the entire genre is losing players to other genres. The only MMO showing notable growth right now is presumably FFXIV, and even that's become questionable since Square Enix switched from sharing active subscriptions to registered accounts (not a great sign).<br />
<br />
<br />
That said, there absolutely is a large dedicated core of subscribers that, either out of dedication or just abundant disposable income, will never stop playing the game. All you need to do is look at Everquest (a game which never even reached a million simultaneous subscribers) and see that it has a large enough playersbase to remain in operation, and you'll know that the same will be true for WoW.<br />
<br />
Nevermind the possibility of a full F2P conversion, which will no doubt come eventually, and surely provide a large enough playerbase to keep the game profitable until the sun fucking burns out.</div></div><hr />

The only thing they need to do is make sure Legion is up to standard. WoD is a lost cause. We're probably going to have HFC for as long as Siege. I got bored with Siege and it was a hell of a lot more interesting than HCF. With the guild gone 'casual' heroic only raiding, we're now done with the WoD content.<br />
<br />
Some have already left to play other games while waiting for Legion (asking us not to remove them from the guild) and I'm going to focus on getting some old achievements and collect some mounts. Old content is going to keep me subscribed.</div></div><hr />

The 5,5 million subs reported are worldwide, and include the asian realms where people pay by the hour not by the month, so they can stop playing and start playing and not worry about cancelling (they're &quot;subbed&quot; if they log in once during the quarter, even if they spent 0,01$ in connection times).<br />
<br />
Remember that Blizzard said repeatedly that most of the variation comes from asian realms where people are not really subscribed with monthly payments.<br />
<br />
Exactly...remember in vanilla we had around the same subs but all was in europe/USA...the servers were full of people..now servers are empty, because the majority of subs are from Asia where they pay by hour...</div></div><hr />

This is the case for most hardcore players and will be the reason the sub numbers havn't dropped just due to the fact that getting enough money for a sub token is pretty much all that's left to do outside of a weekly raid.<br />

Activision bought King, not Blizzard Entertainment. Activision is a publisher, this is what they do; purchase and invest in studios. King is now one of dozens of subsidiaries Activision owns. And, incidentally, King earns upwards of $500 million a year in pure profit from their mobile titles.<br />
<br />
What Activision does has virtually no impact on Blizzard Entertainment, and certainly not on WoW. They're two completely seperate companies which happen to be owned by holding company Activision Blizzard, which was formerly named Vivendi Games.</div></div><hr />

If you don`t know what`s going on why don`t you check it on the internet? The token at release was priced at around 35k, went down to 29k and now it`s almost 64k, so from 30k to 60k...in my country it`s double, how about in yours?</div></div><hr />

How do you know that? We know it has the most stable NUMBER of subscriptions. We have no idea about actual population.<br />

The number of subscriptions is the result of (people who continue subscribing) + (people who start subscribing) - (people who stop subscribing).<br />

Essentially, it is possible 5 million people left, and 5 million people joined every single month during WotLK, and the subscription number line would still look like that - unchanged.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stop looking at subscription numbers to quantify quality. It doesn't work that way.</div></div><hr />

Activision is a publisher, this is what they do; purchase and invest in studios. King is now one of dozens of subsidiaries Activision owns. And, incidentally, King earns upwards of $500 million a year in pure profit from their mobile titles.<br />
<br />
What Activision does has virtually no impact on Blizzard Entertainment, and certainly not on WoW. They're two completely seperate companies which happen to be owned by holding company Activision Blizzard, which was formerly named Vivendi Games.<br />
<br />
Activision decisions have a direct impact on Blizzard budgetting. It's called Activision-Blizzard for a reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh wait that's not true. It doesn't matter in the slightest if there's 5.5, 5.6, or .6 subscribers, I can still play and have fun. If it stops being fun I can quit, regardless of how many subscribers it has. And after I quit I can bitch constantly on forums about how bad WoW sucks now and laugh about how many subscribers it's losing. Oh boy!</div></div><hr />

The movie will be released in 2016 and then we get Legion in 2016. If you did not notice, the cast of the movie contains the following:<br />
<br />
- Llane Wrynn - who is not alive during MAIN universe and he is Varian's Grandfather.<br />
- Varian Wrynn - whos is not alive during ALTERNATIVE universe but only in main universe (meaning, he did not live in age of Warcraft 1), he &quot;meets&quot; his grandfather.<br />
<br />
Same stuff happened with Thrall. He found his father, Durotan, in Warlords of Draenor and he does not know the world of Draenor. This short facts shows that the story in the movie is still about alternative universe and Gul'dan, which is as well in the cast. <br />
<br />
What we get in 2016? Legion. <br />
Who is a boss in Suramar? Gul'dan. <br />
<br />
Just a natural thing of progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not confusing at all but it can be if you just play the game to &quot;smash the buttons&quot; and not following the lore.<br />
<br />
Maybe I wasn't very accurate with writing (I corrected it a bit to make more sense) but my point was that Varian is probably going to meet his Grandfather in the movie. Hence, alternative universe story is till going on. But seeing that you believe that it is just a story telling from something that already happened, I can clearly see why it's confusing.<br />
<br />
What does the movie have to do with Legion? <br />
<br />
The movie is set in the first war in the main timeline, so Thrall is not yet born but Durotan, Grom and Gul'dan will be there.<br />
Llane Wrynn is Varians FATHER, not his grandfather, and Verian was alive during the first war as well (he was around 10) so how is it conected to the alternate timeline?</div></div><hr />

<br />
However from a business stand point, thats great news. We effectively pay 5 bucks more a month and never really use server resources.<br />
<br />
You're wrong. You're efffectively paying NOTHING. Someone else has effectively Blizzard 5 bucks more and Blizzard has already gained those extra bucks before you even buy the token. Hell even if you didn't buy the token, Blizzard would have still made the extra bucks. Because when you buy the token, all the other player gets is your gold. But Blizzard has already the 5 bucks in their pockets and couldn't care less if you bought the token or not.</div></div><hr />

It's certainly not a disaster.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it's changed but the routine issue with the figures is that Blizz don't break it down by region. As it is they tend to emphasise the losses in China... although there's a comment on the warcraftrealms forum that suggests eu is doing worse...<br />
<br />
The anomalous aspect was the huge swell in support in anticipation of the launch, making WoD the most successful launch of its entire history.<br />
<br />
I doubt this will be repeated in a hurry - especially not with the same people, given the fiasco of WoD's launch ('victim of its own success' lol).<br />
<br />
I think if there is going to be a successive resurrection then it will be down to getting a boost off the movie... so I guess a lot will hang on that and would expect a lot of cross promotion.</div></div><hr />

You do know there are many, many more servers than your own, right?<br />
<br />
I have to fly out to a really remote and unusual leveling area to not find a player in sight. There's always a bunch of people wherever I am. Not saying dead servers isnt a problem - they probably should be merging servers that are tiny - but to assume it's as dead everywhere as it is on your server is just foolish.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone will be able to do Pathfinder to unlock flight in WoD due to time constraints or other reasons. Pathfinder didn't bring people back, quite the opposite of whatever bringing them back is, kept ex and new players away even and lost some more subs.<br />
<br />
Think about a gold fee alternative to buy flight in WoD, Blizz. If you want to save WoW that is, and haven't deliberately relegated it onto the MMO scrap heap while Overwatch, Hearthstone and, eh, Candy Crush get all of the dev love now.<br />
<br />
Yes, being able to pay gold for flying will save the game! <br />
<br />
If you don't have enough time to do Pathfinder, you don't have enough time to play the game in the first place. You just do almost all of it while levelling anyway, with the exception of the apexis dailies, which you can do....in about 1 hour or less and the Tannan dailies which don't take long, or you can PAY GOLD for the rep tokens.</div></div><hr />

I really enjoyed WoD release and the levelling, all on ground so you could truly explore. But then once you were done with all that, there just were not much world content; there was Foundry which was already (mostly) in the game, just not unlocked and the legendary chain which was pretty much it until 6.2 in terms of major features. I don't know if it was because they intended faster expansions but they should just drop that concept if faster expansions (which won't really be that much faster) means less expansion cohesion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you. Wow's aging game engine is becoming more and more of an issue, especially when other MMO's offer F2P or even B2P with 10x's better graphics. Blizzard can either bite the bullet and completely overhaul the game engine or they can scrap the existing WOW in lieu of a newer and better WOW with modern graphics. Both cost $$$, so I seriously doubt Blizzard will do that.</div></div><hr />
