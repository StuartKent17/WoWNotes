Now that BlizzCon is over and Warlords of Draenor has been unveiled, we’ve been getting some additional questions about the gear changes currently planned for the expansion. To help shed some more light on what you can expect, we thought we’d take a bit of time to clarify a few things.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that as with anything still in development, the information we share now will likely change as we progress, but this should help give you a good understanding of our goals and thinking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Armor Pieces: Head, Shoulders, Chest, Legs, Gloves, Belt, Boots, and Bracers<br />
<br />
Primary Stats<br />
<br />
One of our main intents for primary stats is to make sure that higher Item Level (ilvl) pieces from new content are almost always superior to items from older content. Further, the changes we’re making to primary stats will help make pieces more universal, so groups will find gear drops more useful more often. This means you’ll be disenchanting less Intellect plate (only usable by Paladins today) or Agility mail (only usable by Hunters and Enhancement Shamans today). As we discussed at BlizzCon, we’re accomplishing this by making it so primary stats for a given piece of gear will change based on your current spec, though it’s likely that only new gear added in Warlords will work like this, as it might be impossible to implement this for all existing gear. Here are some additional points to know regarding the changes to primary stats:<br />
<br />
<br />
Armor pieces will always have some amount of Stamina and Armor value. Armor pieces always have Strength, Intellect, or Agility as a primary stat. Plate has either Strength or Intellect. Mail and Leather have either Agility or Intellect. Cloth has Intellect. In the cases of Plate, Mail, and Leather, the primary stat will change depending on your current spec. Specifically, casters (including healers) will get Intellect, and melee or tank specs will get Strength or Agility.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondary Stats<br />
<br />
Our intent for secondary stats is to differentiate pieces that occupy the same slot, allow for player customization, and to further differentiate specs within a class. Here are a few important points regarding the changes that are currently planned for secondary stats:<br />
<br />
Secondary stats don’t change based on spec on armor pieces (or any piece). Secondary stats on armor pieces can still include Haste, Crit, and/or Mastery. Secondary stats on armor pieces will no longer include Hit, Expertise, Dodge, or Parry. These are being retired in Warlords, and will likely be removed even from existing gear. Secondary stats on armor pieces will also no longer include Spirit, nor will they include Bonus Armor, which are reserved exclusively for non-armor pieces (which are explained below). In addition, secondary stats on armor pieces may include several new stats we are exploring such as Readiness, Amplify, and Multi-strike. Technical Game Designer Chadd “Celestalon” Nervig has been sharing more details about these on his Twitter account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additional Properties<br />
<br />
Armor pieces may have three other properties at random. First, items may be higher Item Level than normal. For sake of this discussion, we’ll call these items Warforged for now.<br />
<br />
Second, items may have gem sockets. Unlike gem sockets today, gem sockets in Warlords of Draenor will be rarer but more powerful. There will be no socket bonuses, but we are strongly considering requiring the right color gem for the socket. All gems will grant secondary stats, including Spirit and Bonus Armor (see below).<br />
<br />
Finally, items may have tertiary stats. These include things like a bonus to Movement Speed, Sturdiness, Life Steal, Avoidance (less AoE damage), and Cleave. Because of the rarity of tertiary starts, stacking them to produce (for example) a Movement Speed set will take enormous effort.<br />
<br />
The design intent of these additional qualities on items is to make itemization more exciting and to give it more longevity. Rather than waiting weeks to get a breastplate, you might get one pretty quickly—but to get a true “best-in-slot” item will take much more effort and a bit of luck. Here are a few more points to consider for these properties:<br />
<br />
<br />
We haven’t decided on exact numbers yet, but for the current discussion, assume something like a 10% chance for an item to have an additional property. It’s possible for one item to have all three of these properties, but the chance of that is very small. The properties are determined at the time an item is looted (and possibly even includes crafted gear). For example, if an ogre boss drops two copies of the Bracers of Crithto, one might be a normal version, while another might have a tertiary stat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Being Warforged, having a socket, or having a tertiary stat do not count against the stat budget of the item—they are strictly bonuses. The item will not have reduced primary or secondary stats in order to have these additional properties.<br />
<br />
Set Bonuses<br />
<br />
Similar to primary stats, set bonuses will also change depending on your current spec. This means a Paladin may only need one tier set rather than one for Holy and one for Retribution. It also means that set bonuses can be more tailored towards a spec. For instance, Marksman Hunter set bonuses can have different bonuses or different numbers than a Survival Hunter set. Like today, not every helmet, chest piece, or other piece of armor that drops will be part of a tier set.<br />
<br />
Non-Armor Pieces: Weapons, Rings, Cloak, Necklace, and Trinkets<br />
<br />
Primary Stats<br />
<br />
In general, most of these pieces will not have Strength, Agility, or Intellect. Instead, they may have Attack Power or Spell Power to make sure they are more universal. However, our current thought it to keep primary stats on weapons so that they continue to feel iconic and special. Many of the items will have Stamina as well.<br />
<br />
Secondary Stats<br />
<br />
The information about secondary stats on armor above also applies here. In addition, Spirit and Bonus Armor can appear on these items. Spirit is only useful for healers. Bonus Armor is generally only useful for tanks. A Spell Power piece without Spirit may be attractive to healers or may be attractive to DPS casters instead.<br />
<br />
The intent of including Spirit and Bonus Armor on these pieces is to make sure some items are still valuable only to healer and tank specs, helping to make sure they don’t have too much competition for gear against the more numerous DPS players in a given group. These are also stats we consider interesting, because how much of each of these stats a tank or healer might want is more subjective. For example, one tank in a group might prefer more Bonus Armor while another might prefer more Haste.<br />
<br />
In the case of Spirit, imagine that stacking Spirit on every non-armor slot will give you more mana regeneration than you would reasonably need. That is to say, you likely won’t need Spirit on every single spot in order to function as a healer.<br />
<br />
In the case of Bonus Armor, this stat fills the niche that Dodge and Parry fill today. We like tanks avoiding attacks as a mechanic, but it hasn’t proven to be a particularly interesting gearing strategy. However, we still want a dedicated damage-mitigation stat, and Bonus Armor will be it.<br />
<br />
Additional Qualities<br />
<br />
These items will also have a chance to have one of the additional qualities discussed above (Warforged, gems, and tertiary stats), and the information related to these qualities on armor still applies here.<br />
<br />
Examples<br />
<br />
A Holy Paladin has a raid tier set from the Blackrock Foundry. If she switches to her Retribution spec, the tier set is still functional, as the primary stats and set bonuses change. However, if she prefers Haste for her Retribution spec and Crit in her Holy spec (and is someone who enjoys the min-max game), then a single set of armor may not be optimal.<br />
<br />
For her healing set, let’s assume this player also has one ring with Spirit, a shield with Spirit, and a trinket that procs on heals. The trinket is almost useless in her Retribution set. The shield is also useless, since Retribution is designed to wield a two-handed weapon. The ring will be sub-optimal because Spirit is useless to a Retribution Paladin, but if it has another valuable stat (e.g. Haste), it may still be worth using—again depending on how min-max-focused the player is.<br />
<br />
A more casual player would probably be fine just using the trinket anyway and using a lower Item Level two-handed mace when she plays Retribution. A more min-max player would probably want separate rings, cloaks, trinkets, neck pieces, and weapons to use in the different specs. A very min-max player—such as someone competing in world-first Mythic raid progression—might even want different heads, shoulders, chests, and so on depending on the mix of secondary stats. This player might even swap out gems between the two specs.<br />
<br />
This may seem like a lot to take in now, but we’ll continue to watch feedback and answer any additional questions where we can. And again, keep in mind that as with anything still in development, this information or some of the details will likely change as we progress.<br />
<br />
As always, we welcome your constructive feedback, and we look forward to reading what you think.</div></div><hr />

Much easier to make a non-optimal piece of gear into a better piece of gear if that is all that keeps dropping in your group.</div></div><hr />

You'll be competing with almost everyone else in your raid for the 0.1% drop rate stuff also, and I guarantee people WILL be loot hoarding for it.</div></div><hr />

So they remove reforging and simplify gemming to get rid of overcomplicated item preparation but then add a mechanic that makes you get a random enchantment on your items?<br />
That will only make people grind for perfectly enchanted items for most/every slots/slot. Imagine having to drop the SAME exact item few times because you wanted tertiary stat instead of ilvl enchant, or hell, even more than 1 of those additional enchants. That's a hell of new dimension of grind.<br />
That's awful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea may be noble but the drama that this change is going to bring is going to tremendous. Think of it, half your raid consists of leather wearers, in case RNG screws you over you probably will be stuck with sub-optimal gear all-tier long regardless and this will be the icing over the cake considering loot drama due to these shared items having the elusive stats.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well... i much rather have to make a different set and collect armor pieces nobody else needs for my second spec, than having to fight with Warriors, Derp-Knights and other Paladins about the Stuff i need for Healing. This will make much more problems than it will solve in raids, i am convinced. I mean, we need to see how it turns out in the end, and what these silly new sub-stats actually affect... but currently tanks use mastery. Tons of it. Holy Paladins don't give a flying f*ck about anything but Mastery either once they got enough spirit, which is now considered a weapon-stat. Ergo; Instantly we got a huge problem since Heal-Paladins and Tank-Paladins and Tank-Dks will want the exact same items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to sound like a negative nancy, but this is an easy way to keep people stick with the game for longer. Someone that only does LFR and gets a full set can just stop playing completely since they have nothing to do. Add things like this and it becomes attractive to keep grinding the LFR until your eyes bleed.<br />
<br />
(LFR/Flex/Normal/Heroic interchangable here)</div></div><hr />

<br />
curious how jewelcrafters will fare. sockets already seemed much more scarce this expansion and hardly stacked up against enchanting. while leveling gear didn't get that many enchants, there was and is certainly a market for entry level 90 gear and heirlooms being enchanted, gear that mostly has no sockets. Just seems like quite a disparity. Will we get &quot;enchant sockets&quot; on gear to balance the two or what's the plan?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is precisely their objective, it will now take longer to get full BiS items (truly BiS I mean, with the exact secondary stats you are looking for) and thus players will keep logging in and playing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiralphoenix</div><div class="date">2013-11-26, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will be interesting to see what they do with Jewelcrafting. Probably a shift towards making a lot more Necks/Rings/Trinkets, since gems are going to be in such low demand. They'll have to drastically reduce the rate you get them as well or they will have no value whatsoever...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rye25</div><div class="date">2013-11-26, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Awesome work guys.. Your doing a great job on this expansion...Don't give in to people complaining before they even experience it...Your making all the right moves..I haven't been this excited in a long time!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Damerflinn</div><div class="date">2013-11-26, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't like the idea of it being &quot;ok&quot; for someone to use a piece that doesn't work for them just because it is only a ring or a necklace. It's one of the most frustrating things in this game. Wiping on a boss in a dungeon, or an LFR and looking at the healers gear, or the tanks gear, and seeing that half of it are stats that don't help them. Typically if a DPS is doing something like that, it's not as big of a deal, a 496 DPS in LFR will be fine, but a 496 Tank won't be. Adding in this new idea that having the correct stats for your spec is only for &quot;min maxers&quot; is going to make this even worse. You are going to start seeing people in LFR that have all their rings and back piece and trinket be for a healing spec, while pulling shit DPS, or not surviving as a tank, and everyone else is expected to carry them.<br />
<br />
And maybe an even bigger question, is what about Valor gear, and PvP gear, will it have these tertiary stats on it? Will it be a random chance when you purchase that Valor or Conquest (or the WoD equivalent) to have these tertiary stats? Or is Valor going to just be something that you only use to upgrade pieces you get from drops, because you just get more value out of scaling up a piece then replacing a piece that may be a much lower itm lvl. It seems like gearing is going to be a major pain in the ass from a RL PoV. Do you just ignore these extra bonus stuff, and go with who that piece is best itemized for, or do you let that Tank or healer grab that piece that isn't really itemized for them, but has the tertiary stat that works the best for them, or that they want. <br />
<br />
Obviously early release info, is early info, and much will change, but it seems like they have really opened a can of worms here, and I just hope that we don't spend the entire expansion waiting for them to fix this new system, when honestly the old gearing system was fine, and didn't really need an overhaul.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, they do a lot of really really sweeping and unnecessary changes. Not just &quot;forged&quot; but now &quot;forged,&quot; PLUS sockets (which they are saying will be even bigger than now!!) PLUS tertiary stats (it's not like movement speed is trivial, it's huge).<br />
<br />
I can already see it, &quot;legendary&quot; guy with his movement speed items he loot-hoarded from his guild, sockets (which matter more than they do in CM), and forged items. &quot;Bring the gear, not the player.&quot; All &quot;0.1% trifecta&quot; gear goes to the person in a relationship with the GM. Incoming more loot drama/guilds falling apart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i agree. If you want to simplify it take all the tertiary stuff and make them part of spells or spell combos with other classes. for gear just leave the primary and secondary stats even if secondarys are only on off pieces. And why bring back ap and sp just make it str/agi/int.<br />
<br />
without reforging this is just another long treadmill.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is pretty slick gearing optimally will imo be worse and just a longer grind. <br />
<br />
Of course, we'll have to wait and see what beta brings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really is, especially as someone excellently pointed out (I don't remember who), unlike Diablo, we don't get unlimited boss kills for loot a week anyway. I'm not against some RNG for gearing, but this just sounds like a LOT. Can't my Bracers of Broken Doubt just be... Bracers of Broken Doubt?<br />
<br />
(Also I mentioned trifecta but in reality there's EVEN MORE rng because you have desirable versus crap tertiary stats too...)</div></div><hr />

I like the game and will probably sub for WoD, but I don't like how they justify this gearing change by saying it will simplify the system while it will actually do the opposite, forcing those who pursue the best stats to endlessly grind. People who don't care about full gear potential won't be affected, but then again, this change is not about them as they may not even be using reforge/gem their items. <br />
<br />
Not to be overly negative, I am happy that hit/exp will disappear and be replaced by some fun stats like cleave.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nightfalls</div><div class="date">2013-11-26, 08:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought warforged was/is enough RNG<br />

This. It really is enough. Now you get 1) even WITHOUT any modifications there's more RNG since lack of reforge exacerbates &quot;good secondaries versus bad.&quot; 2) With gems, RNG is a huge factor. 3) With tertiary stats you need a stat then you need the right stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea may be noble but the drama that this change is going to bring is going to tremendous. Think of it, half your raid consists of leather wearers, in case RNG screws you over you probably will be stuck with sub-optimal gear all-tier long regardless and this will be the icing over the cake considering loot drama due to these shared items having the elusive stats.<br />
<br />
I'd say you'd actually gear faster. You're competing with others for armor types now mostly, not stats on top of armor type anymore. More people will get their gear faster because they aren't waiting on certain stats (technically). And so &quot;wasted&quot; gear (in which no one needs a roll on either because they already have it, or no one can use it) is mostly abolished because useful gear will drop a lot more often, because its stats are more ambiguous. Depending on what you run, you will have an even greater chance at loot as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to be overly negative, I am happy that hit/exp will disappear and be replaced by some fun stats like cleave.<br />

Extending the grind isn't the same as complicating the system.<br />
<br />
The new system is far simpler. No caps, no reforging.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's really not extending the grind. Getting the ideal tertiary bonus or whatever will still be a pretty minimal increase. They won't be required just as &quot;Best in slot&quot; isn't required now. It's just an added bonus when farming content you've acquired all the gear for, so that you can still have some excitement in the drops every once in a while - just an extension of what thunderforged/warforged is now.</div></div><hr />

Reforging gives players choice, the proposed system puts us even more victim to RNG with what we get. <br />
<br />
The examples in the blue post are very worrisome in that there's a real sense of &quot;oh you'll be fine with just ok pieces&quot; and &quot;well if you prefer Crit over Haste for your spec you'd better keep at it!&quot; as the RNG gods cackle and wring their evil fingers. <br />
<br />
I play a Shaman healer, and as such I recognise that Haste is good, Mastery is mediocre and Crit is fantastic, and by and large I can tweak my gear via gems and reforging to optimise my performance. But Blizz decide &quot;we want you to have a lot of Mastery, so here's a crap tonne of Mastery gear&quot; there's nothing I can do about it except wallow in frustration at the failure of the right loot drops. <br />
And also as a healer I know how blind Blizzard are to the importance of Spirit on healer gear given the absurd selections on the personal loot system and how rare a Spirit piece is on Timeless Isle loot despite the assertion that it's &quot;good for my Restoration spec&quot;. <br />
<br />
This system is a huge step back to being forced into what Blizzard think our class benefits from rather than what the player feels. I do not like this one bit. I hope there is a massive re-evaluation by Blizz on this. And given their reasons for dropping reforging (because math) are so weak, this whole proposal is just foul.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you're right. Like the new no flying till some random future patch date, the new RNG gear trumps just the normal RNG gear gathering by adding in yet another factor. Blizzard plans to extend content through some extremely warped methods.<br />
<br />
What is another way to make sure you don't feel complete. Make add another RNG to getting gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It absolutely is extending the grind. Tertiary stats aren't a make or break, but with the proposal that gems be a lot more powerful, the difference between the same piece with or without a socket will be substantial. This is significant for healers as well as gems will be an extra source of Spirit and healers all know how skewed Blizzard's perceptions on the necessity of Spirit for healers are. <br />
<br />
Without the ability to customise my gear, my grind for gear is considerably extended as I continue to try not even for BiS but for the right distribution of stats. This seems a clear grab for people to play longer, and it doesn't matter if they're happy or frustrated as long as they are subscribed.<br />
<br />
Do we know if socketed items will have a higher ilvl like Warforged does now? If not, then it's quite clear that anything not socketed is the weaker version of the item, so one player with the socketed bracers has a clear performance advantage over the player without, even though they have the same ilvl gear piece.<br />
<br />
<br />
This actually requires more thought and complexity<br />
<br />
How so? Gone is my ability to modify my gear towards a desired result. Gone is my ability to balance my stats, I only have what I'm given by RNG luck. Blizz stated they were removing reforging because it was &quot;too hard&quot; to figure out the math, when the reality is that the ability to modify gear led to shorter gear chase time and the use of non-Blizzard resources to maximise benefit. Basically reforging got their shorts in a knot by giving too much to the community.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't require any thought at all. You pray for RNG gods and hope that you get warforged, socketed and tertiary stat piece. If you don't, welcome back next week. I see where they are going with this but that's way too much RNG. They really need to make quite a big chance for all the extra stuff or work it in with crafting or item that let's you add socket for an example or something. Otherwise it's 4 month grind for that one chest you've seen 10 times now but it just doesn't have the additional properties.</div></div><hr />

If crafting is similar to its current state, there would only be as many items as there can be now. Players can't infinitely craft the good stuff. Just junk that no one would be looking at anyways.<br />

How would you be forced to raid more? They stated that the goal is for higher ilvl to always be better. How would you raid more than once per lockout as you do now on the same character?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What will happen when the opposite is true. For example, you have a MW and WW monks, a rogue and a moonkin in your raid and it becomes apparent that haste is the top stat for all tree who are effectively on the same gear and skill-level, who will you give the item to and how long will it take for all these players to fill in this common item-slot with RNG in place?<br />
<br />
Furthermore, tier pieces as they stand cause drama, now they are in the plans of radiating it outward by making different classes to compete for even more items.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm not even factoring in the effect of constantly required grind to get that perfect piece into this cataclysmic equation. While at it, they are removing reforging as well, essentially turning the game into a WoW with D3's game system in place for the gear threadmill.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm tried to take away such quality of life features from players and the players that were upset with them (around 1 million people) left.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, I'm a casual now that this will not affect me that much but it seems like the kind of change that will hinder organized raiding by a huge margin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well there's some value to RNG and it is nice to think you might get an upgrade versus not... but there's a point. When the gear's like Diablo and you realize it's impossible to get good shit... I think it discourages people from playing the gearing game at all more than sticks them to another grind.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of guilds do not clear the raids before the next patch is out (or do so barely before) so I think that's incentive enough to keep plugging away.</div></div><hr />

The only upsides on this whole concept seems to be: You dont necessarily need new items for your other specs and most importantly: Blizzard needs to think less about loot-tables. And i hardly doubt the first thing really mattered.<br />
<br />
Yes But consider in this current system, your Healing Monk wins a leather chestpiece with all his shiny stats on it etc, your tree gets the same next run, then the run after it drops again, what happens to it? It gets DE'd and its a piece of wasted loot. however under the new system, your bear, tank monk and rogue can all possibly use it. In the end it'll work out that everyone gears up quicker, just not right at the start of progression, but thats just my opinion on the system :)</div></div><hr />

With the handling of off pieces there also seems to be far too much competition for pieces. While it is nice that it will be rarer for pieces to be unwanted it can promote additional drama over loot especially when healers are being given loot only relevant to them and pickings of non-spirit pieces. As a healer I think this is unnecessary imbalance in loot between group rolls.<br />
<br />
I am also wondering how is jewlcrafting going to change as players might not have any gems with the way the blog described. Enchants have been said to be reduced but still there for everyone with more stat varieties which might mean more space for customization and changing of enchants per spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do we know if socketed items will have a higher ilvl like Warforged does now? If not, then it's quite clear that anything not socketed is the weaker version of the item, so one player with the socketed bracers has a clear performance advantage over the player without, even though they have the same ilvl gear piece.<br />
<br />
I also wonder how it is going to work with ilvl scaling as the higher ilvl bonus gear will have an higher ilvl while those with gems or other bonuses will not. It would likely only impact a small fraction of the playerbase while still being a balance issue in the system. This kind of system works well for a game like Diablo but for WoW just opens up so much more issues. The past three expansions Blizzard has been trying to make getting gear less of a special thing and are now trying to spice it up and with it bring in a number of problems the developers was trying to move away from in the first place.</div></div><hr />

All in all it seems like things are becoming hack and slash. You don't have to worry about talent trees anymore because everything is viable. You don't have to worry about farming for gems and enchants because they are almost all removed. Hit and exp removed. There will be no more gear discussion because it will be irrelevant.

<br />
All in all it seems like things are becoming hack and slash. You don't have to worry about talent trees anymore because everything is viable. You don't have to worry about farming for gems and enchants because they are almost all removed. Hit and exp removed. There will be no more gear discussion because it will be irrelevant. Group with however many people you can find. Enter the instance. Button smash. Gg game over. Nothing else to do. Oh wait... Go grind quests and dailies while running around on your ground mounts (because we all spent thousands of gold on northrend, Cata, and mop flying for no reason)being part of the world.<br />
<br />
Except with the flying part, I agree with you, min/max players are getting screwed :(<br />
This doesn't make me want to buy WoD.<br />
<br />
But I'll wait the beta to see how it</div></div><hr />

The tertiary stats are utter bullshit, how can they even think of something like that? Either the numbers will be so small that they don´t matter at all, or you are forced to give the same loot to your cores week after week until they get the stat they need.

Reread the description. Its nothing like Diablo's loot system. If you keep repeating it then you're clearly either too lazy to actually read it, too foolish to understand it, or are spouting nonsense on purpose.<br />
The diablo's loot system is shifting to place more focus on random bonus stats to create variety with a more stable core stat set. On top of that diablo is getting reforging. Random bonus stats works well in a game like diablo, for WoW particularly with those who do group based looting might find random bonus stats to amplify loot drama and dissatisfaction from loot upgrades. Some times you need the bad to make the good feel that much more rewarding. For WoW I personally dont think it should play a roll in loot unless everything moves to personal loot.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spiralphoenix</div><div class="date">2013-11-26, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It absolutely is extending the grind. Tertiary stats aren't a make or break, but with the proposal that gems be a lot more powerful, the difference between the same piece with or without a socket will be substantial. This is significant for healers as well as gems will be an extra source of Spirit and healers all know how skewed Blizzard's perceptions on the necessity of Spirit for healers are. <br />
<br />
Without the ability to customise my gear, my grind for gear is considerably extended as I continue to try not even for BiS but for the right distribution of stats. This seems a clear grab for people to play longer, and it doesn't matter if they're happy or frustrated as long as they are subscribed.<br />
<br />
Do we know if socketed items will have a higher ilvl like Warforged does now? If not, then it's quite clear that anything not socketed is the weaker version of the item, so one player with the socketed bracers has a clear performance advantage over the player without, even though they have the same ilvl gear piece.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How so? Gone is my ability to modify my gear towards a desired result. Gone is my ability to balance my stats, I only have what I'm given by RNG luck. Blizz stated they were removing reforging because it was &quot;too hard&quot; to figure out the math, when the reality is that the ability to modify gear led to shorter gear chase time and the use of non-Blizzard resources to maximise benefit. Basically reforging got their shorts in a knot by giving too much to the community.<br />
<br />
The gear change summary post referenced in this post simply says gems will be &quot;more powerful&quot;. That's very vague and relative. They still don't have to be that significant, especially if it's just one gem. <br />
<br />
As far as I see it, if Blizzard makes a certain &quot;bonus&quot; (ilvl / socket / tertiary) valuable enough that it hinders those that don't have it in doing normal content/progression/etc. and doesn't serve as a true &quot;bonus&quot;, then they've failed at the new system. Which is entirely possible, but when talking about the merits of the system they proposed, you can't really say &quot;well, they'll probably implement it terribly&quot; because that defeats the purpose of talking about anything.<br />
<br />
Socketed items don't have a higher item level, though they can. They stated 10% chance (not set in stone) for each of the 3 &quot;addtional options&quot; being 1) higher ilvl (current warforged model), 2) a socket, or 3) tertiary stats. And they aren't exclusive, so you could have all 3, but it would be very rare.<br />
<br />
Obviously a non-socketed piece is a weaker version of the item, otherwise there'd be no purpose. So one person may have socketed bracers, the other guy, statistically, will have a socketed piece, or a higher ilvl piece, or a piece with a tertiary stat.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard does it right, content will be designed in that gear is expected to be without, or with a very, very minimal amount of the &quot;bonuses&quot;. It only extends the grind in your mind if you feel like you need absolute BIS for everything. It isn't any different than it is now - for me as a 10 man raider, the grind is basically infinite - I will never get all warforged pieces within the current lifespan of the content. And it's not hugely different in terms of &quot;BIS perfection&quot; for a 25m raider - it's still very unlikely you will fill every slot with warforged.</div></div><hr />

Yay more stat padding and forced playstyles! /sarcasm<br />
<br />
Weapons already have the most important stat anyway, damage/spellpower, and already have class restrictions. Make some weapons have spell damage instead of weapon damage if you want to force &quot;iconic and special&quot;. Problem solved. Tanks have shields and forms to increase their armor/health. <br />

<br />
It's something I have been asking of blizzard for years, to be able to use a single set of armor for all 3 specs (because its unfair for hybrids to need 3 sets of gear). I'm happy with that change whole heartedly, but I feel that they may have gone too far with the addition of tertiary stats and how it works in conjunction with secondary stat changes.<br />
<br />
While this speeds up the process of filling out each slot with an upgraded iLvl piece of gear, I feel that its going to create a lot of frustration and loot drama because of how RNG its going to be. I understand they are taking a page back from Vanilla WoW , and with how well the Diablo itemization has evolved over the years (minus some of the D3 woes), but I dont see how having the RNG of Diablo-like loot (like how vanilla was initially) is going to make anything better. They've just substituted one frustration for another, and in the process it took the responsibility out of blizzards hands with having to intricately plan out loot in raids / dungeons. <br />
<br />
This will go beyond just &quot;min/maxing&quot; gear; it will create a whole new breed of item disparity and rage, just like how it is in D3. People will fawn over a certain setup of stats with ferocious enthusiasm, not just because of &quot;min/max&quot; ability, but because they want/need those particular stats. There isnt going to be a single pvp player that wont be going for runspeed stats, or life leech, or other utility like stats. Having just 1 piece of gear with those wont be enough, especially for OCD folks. Those that want a &quot;complete set&quot; of a particular stat arrangement will find this situation dire. I get that blizzard wants these to be &quot;rare bonuses&quot; but its just setting things up for failure and trouble.<br />
<br />
I can just imagine the guild/raid drama over someone wanting a particular stat on his/her gear, and having it get passed to someone else because &quot;he/she already has a piece of that tier already&quot;. The &quot;stars aligning just right&quot; to get a single item is bad enough to drive some people loot crazy, imagine trying to do that again for 2-8 pieces. <br />
<br />
In the same process, it might create the &quot;loot trifecta&quot; situation like in D3, which is going to be its own can of worms. I dont see the crafting economy doing any better in that regard, and its only going to make players mad when they dont create an item with &quot;trifecta&quot; stats that people will actually buy (whether they include crafting in these changes or not, they will be hugely affected by them).<br />
<br />
I also worry that blizzard is going to have to take a D3 approach to item balance, where they dont realize that certain item stacking ends up being &quot;too much&quot; in their eyes, and nerf it; only to piss off peole who spent countless runs/hours getting a large set of items with said stat (because RNG will be killer), only to have their hard work swiftly crumbled. Or on the other side, blizzard cant just change stats because of how much it will affect everyone. <br />
<br />
Its a very, very tight rope they are walking on; both with such a drastic change/addition to the loot system, and because of how much its going to affect progression and time spent in the game.</div></div><hr />

Because blood dks are the only class in the game and lifesteal is the only option, am I right? And because loot never drops right now that you, a Blood DK, find less desirable to use, or cannot use at all, am I right?</div></div><hr />

You forgot that Blizzard intends to make these tertiary stats rare to the point that it will be remotely impossible to get a full set consisting of 'just' speedboost gear. Sure people can min/max it but the chances of them hitting that absolute MAX is going to be so small that it's almost not worth it.

Like Leveling as DPS spec but gearing for healer. However, I am not really a fan of the whole random bonus thing. Sounds a lot like Diablo gear randomization, which I honestly don't like all that much due to the random nature of the gearing.<br />
<br />
I like knowing and planning out my gearing, like which dungeons I need to run what bosses to use bonus rolls on, which gear to spend my Valor/Justice points on, which I'll still be able to do, but then possibly having to run the same dungeon 1000000x or buy the same item from a vendor to get the same item I already have, but with a gem slot or tertiary stat? I don't like that idea...at all.<br />
<br />
Best in Slot isn't going to be as straight forward as simply getting the item anymore, now you have to factor in the possibility of having to get that SAME ITEM 100x over and over until you get the bonus stats you want. The more I think about it, the more I hate it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nekobaka</div><div class="date">2013-11-26, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is precisely their objective, it will now take longer to get full BiS items (truly BiS I mean, with the exact secondary stats you are looking for) and thus players will keep logging in and playing.<br />
I am wondering how many players really do get full BiS. All the way from my progression raiding days in BC to now with things like LFR and such I have not obtained a full BiS. Even with a year of ICC I did not complete my BiS due to RNG of an item like trinkets dropping. The assumption would be that the core of the changes would result in reducing RNG and the developers trying to bring RNG back up. The question would be is the randomness going to keep the bulk of the players subscribed or will the majority just think pretty good is good enough and stop playing anyways, but possibly at a faster rate. Those who seek out BiS in my experience tend to already be fairly consistent players and those who dont care are usually the ones that dont stick around for long periods of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10% chance for the first stat, and yet it still doesnt matter. Its the potential and RNG of getting these stats thats going to drive the wedge between the &quot;have and have nots&quot;. My very point was that because of how hard its going to be to get an even partial set of these items, that its going to drive obsession through the roof. Blizzard may &quot;intend&quot; for these to be semi trivial bonuses...and are there just to &quot;add flavor&quot; but they know better after all these years (or at least they should know), that this kind of a system is the very reason why theyve worked on making things LESS RNG , and much more controllable. Its a complete reversal of years of work, and its going to follow in the same mud holes as the D3 system.<br />
<br />
They can have all the intentions in the world (which they do every month) but they have a very poor record of actually being able to deliver on their dreams and ideals. This is what makes the changes that much more worrisome.</div></div><hr />

(You would be unable to change any of that once rolled of course). It would be a form of &quot;bad luck protection&quot; and take a bit of sting out of being lower on loot priority/victim of point hoarding.<br />

fail to under stand this for only a tiny increase in something as some said.<br />
<br />
It is only better in the way its being slightly better. Nowadays you get the same bloody axe or whatever and disenchant it... in WoD you might get a +1% cleave and I bet you are going to equip that instead of your 0% cleave axe.<br />
<br />
From your point of view, I would probably call it a &quot;flavor&quot;. That is, something that is fun to show off with (and actually makes more of a different than a paintjob) but will not be of any concern for hardcore raiders.</div></div><hr />

While I am not 100% sure on the new system.<br />
<br />
I do think hit and expertise and to a lesser extent dodge and parry needed to go.<br />
<br />
hit and expertise are not in any way shape of form &quot;fun&quot; stats they are a pita to manage and I am very glad to see them go.<br />
<br />
I am a bit scared the new system is going to have way to much RNG but I want to see more information before deciding.<br />
<br />
I think I would of preferred &quot;Remove hit and expertise&quot; but keep reforging.<br />
<br />
Its not in any way shape of form a game breaker for me though.</div></div><hr />

We have no idea how the system will work. It will not ANYTHING like Diablo 3. You will not get strength on a mage item or mana regen on a rogue piece. The lack of RNG is one of the biggest problems with WoW. Today as soon as you get item xyz of off of boss abc you are done and never have to see him again.

It is an useless idea that will only lead to the tertiary stat actually being worth something, burning out everyone trying to max their gear with the &quot;right&quot; stat.</div></div><hr />

The normal unsocketed/non-tertiary gear that drops will be just fine to complete whatever raid it dropped from, etc.<br />
Do you -need- Warforged gear to complete Heroic SoO? Nope... but it does make things just a little easier.<br />

<br />
E.g. for two items of the same kind with different stats, but same ilevel, a pointbased system (going by ilevel) will assign the same cost for both the items, though one is better itemized than the other -- which effectively means that the poorer itemized item needs to be cheaper or nobody is going to bid on it.</div></div><hr />

That is the problem. People play Diablo games for years due to this mechanic and trying to find that perfect gear set-up which they may never get, like people chasing that carrot-on-a-stick.

<br />
A few remarks:<br />
<br />
I would have removed bracers. Physically they take about the same place as gloves. Merge them. We have enough pieces of gear anyway. Many other mmo-s have way less pieces. For example some have 1 piece for chest+shoulders+legs.<br />
<br />
Multistrike sounds interesting but not so good. We have a ton of aoe abilities in the game already. I'm not sure if we need even gear that does that. Maybe if they were only trinkets like in SoO.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if some of the extra qualities were an upgrade and not a chance to have. Because it will turn into grindfest for 0.1% drop chance items. I prefer when I can upgrade my items with hard work. Some lucky involved is ok, but if I have to get lucky with optimal secondary stats, available gem slot and tertiary stat too, that might be too much luck needed for one BiS. I imagine it as a droppable runestone or whatever that can be used on an item to add the tertiary stat onto it. [Runestone of Speed] &gt; use it on your item to add 5% movement speed. Would be a rare drop so you don't have it on all your items in a month but still not grinding for the proper item. You can have your gear and upgrade later with these.<br />
<br />
If spirit is not a secondary stat, I wonder if a ring with it will still have the same amount of secondary stats and have spirit as a bonus, or spirit will replace one of the secondaries. Probably the last one.<br />
<br />
They cut dodge, parry from gear, but not from the game. Does it mean tanks will have way higher passive avoidance to be the same effective as now, or will they have very low avoidance but higher passive reduced damage taken from bonus armor gear?<br />
<br />
I don't get how can they not update older gear. Write a function like microsoft office has for replacing all &quot;xyz&quot; words for &quot;abc&quot;. Is it really that hard? I call it lazyness. Updated stats should always apply to the whole game. For leveling and for the feeling you are playing a game made by professionals.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pesticide</div><div class="date">2013-11-26, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If your going to redo the armor system why not redo the entire loot system as well. Make bosses drop items used for crafting and not drop any gear. Instead of quests giving you armor make them also give you crafting mats and then get the community to interact even more by making those items need more than 1 profession to 'fix' the piece of gear. Such as you get a handful of mats that you receive from multiple bosses, you fuse them together getting a &quot;cracked _insert armor piece&quot;, then take them to a blacksmith/tailor/leatherworking with some ore/ingots/leather/cloth and he reforges the item in the &quot;will not trade&quot; window because all of the mats are bop. If your going to change the game, change it for the betterment of the game. Not just to make this stuff easier and less complicated because the average player is retarded.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pickwickman</div><div class="date">2013-11-26, 10:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually after calculating the chance to even get one item with all three things happening is... interesting.<br />
<br />
All 3 have around 10% chance to happen. So to get an item with all 3 it's 0.1^3 = 0.1% chance to get such an item. Factor in that there's most of the time 1 tertiary you want, that makes the chance of getting your &quot;BiS&quot; item 0.02%.<br />
<br />
Factor in that most bosses on average have 15 items on their loot list and you come to a whopping 0.02% / 15 = 0.0013% chance to have the boss drop the item you want, if the boss can't drop doubles of the item you seek. If corrected for that bosses on 25 should probably drop 3 items that would make it around 0.0039%!<br />
<br />
So yeah, getting a full kit with everything on it will be IMPOSSIBLE even with 19 altraids for even a single raider over the course of a tier. So you'd get like 2-3 of these items on an average raider at the end of a tier.<br />
<br />
And a coinroll would give you around 0.003% chance to get the item if it is the ONLY item you can get on that bosses lootlist.<br />

<br />
Exactly, that's what I'm really not a fan of. Player control (with RNG from the game) rewards skill and theorycrafting, total game control is stupid and rewards pure luck. Requiring more elaborate loot systems does not make for a better game in my books.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find it much more likely that people missed the part that went unsaid. Blizzard DOES NOT WANT you to get the gear you want, how you feel about that decision is, in their opinion, irrelevant. <br />
<br />
There are some people who would prefer to get all their BiS the first time they clear a raid, and some who prefer a long, slow, painful, RNG-filled, heartbreaking grind, and then most of us who fall in the middle. <br />
<br />
What Blizzard is saying with this is, we want to try and please both sides a little bit. It will be easy to obtain a fully functioning gear set in just a couple weeks, but if you want THE BEST gear, or if you really seek out those like .5-1% boosts from each piece, then stick around and try and get a warforged gem socket.<br />
<br />
The tertiary stats seem like they'll be situational at best, which can be a big deal on SOME fights, but it's highly unlikely they'll let them stack high enough to be gamebreaking. I very much doubt even if you had AoE reduction on EVERY piece that they'd let it stack beyond 25%, or movement speed to ever stack beyond 40%. I'd be shocked if they even let it get up to 25%<br />
<br />
Seriously think people need to calm their shit, as they're freaking out about &quot;game changing&quot; stats that, for all we know, could be limited at 8%. A rogue currently is more game breaking on AoE damage than those stats could ever be, why aren't people busting out the pitch forks for that?<br />
<br />
Oh, and to the blood DK that said, &quot;why would I need lifesteal?&quot; I dunno but if I could stack up about 20% lifesteal I'd be a happy camper, right now that'd be an additional 40k+ hps on most fights =D</div></div><hr />

To be fair, having the socket or tertiary stat bonus on the weapon is only as good as having it on any other piece. Not saying you're wrong, but an intelligent person wouldn't consider that socket more valuable than any other socket.<br />

You will probably be able to make better rings/necks/wands that can proc tertiary stats or something to compensate. Probably ones that will fly as freshly backed cookies off of the shelf.<br />
<br />
Although, imagine making 200 rings, and discarding 195 of them 'cause because of overabundance it's more profit to vendor them then put them on the AH.</div></div><hr />

They are adding ridiculous amounts of rng to the gearing while removing practically all power from the hands of the players and call that &quot;interesting&quot;. You will never be able to plan your gearing, and even if you do get lucky with your drops you should pray that Blizzard doesn't make any chances that completely change your stat priorities from one patch to the other, aka 2H Frost DKs from 5.3 to 5.4, or better 1h weapons drop than the 2H you have and you have to change from 2H to DW that have the reverse priority in secondaries. What a bloody joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes; but did it work for Diablo 3 ? When was the last time you equipped an item in Diablo that was not bought of the AH but was obtained directly from farming stuff? <br />
<br />
Blizzard themselves admitted the failure of the system - hence reason for AH withdrawal. <br />
<br />
Now, they are bringing the system to WoW without the AH support. <br />

This is not the right way to dangle the carrot.</div></div><hr />

Will it be a random chance when you purchase that Valor or Conquest (or the WoD equivalent) to have these tertiary stats? Or is Valor going to just be something that you only use to upgrade pieces you get from drops, because you just get more value out of scaling up a piece then replacing a piece that may be a much lower itm lvl. It seems like gearing is going to be a major pain in the ass from a RL PoV. Do you just ignore these extra bonus stuff, and go with who that piece is best itemized for, or do you let that Tank or healer grab that piece that isn't really itemized for them, but has the tertiary stat that works the best for them, or that they want. <br />
<br />
<br />
It would be great if you can purchase the armor upgrade with conquest. They said we may earn some piece of gear randomly when winning bg... Purchasing tertiary stat / extra socket for those slots may be interesting. Keep in mind that gear in Trial of the Gladiator will be the same for all competitors.</div></div><hr />

I don't think i will like the randomness factor though.. Even now in raids, no one cares if a warforged item drops unless it is a trinket / weapon. The warforged gear to me is still a gimmick from their 25man preference / bias. So the random stats thing is too much of a Diablo addition. Especially since they are taking away reforging. If they left reforging in and maybe altered that in some way, then i'd be fine with the randomness on the gear, because we would still have control over our items and stats.</div></div><hr />

It could revive professions a bit and still give a change for best in slot to drop but if it doesn't you can spend some gold to make it the way you want it. Also if things in the game change and you need to change your stats around this could work.<br />
<br />
Without some customization I think most players will be very frustrated with the new system, especially coming from the old one where you had a lot of options. Good play and effort should get you best in slot pieces, not RNG. If it looks like it will be an RNG game for gear I doubt I will play WoD, especially if this carries over to pvp gear in anyway.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly like diablo, except it's not. Almost all of your character power comes from primary and secondary stats which aren't random.

<br />
Durability is flavor (I don't think repairs are unreasonably expensive).<br />
AoE damage reduction you can say isn't really that important for the most part (depending on scaling). So let's err on calling it flavor.<br />
<br />
Cleave... not flavor on many fights. It's actual damage and healing done.<br />
Run speed... useless on some fights but can be a godsend on others. Hint: This just makes it a godsend.<br />
<br />
Forgot one last one: Life Steal. For the most part, that's flavor (unless they screw up and have some 1000% damage taken mechanic in which case a healthy amount makes you an immortal).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you mean the secondary stats, you might have missed that there will be just as many as before(Readiness, Amplify, and Multistrike+ Bonus Armor. The first 3 are from SoO trinkets, so I guess they were 'testing ground'.) Arguably more interesting than the ones they were removing, and not 'filler' like they were. If you mean the primary auto-stat switch, meh, whatever...<br />
<br />
As far as how 'randomized' things will be, we'll have to see, but honestly, I'm glad Hit/Expertise/Dodge/Parry are getting replaced by things that actually 'effect' gameplay(and not just pass some 'virtual hurdle' to gate content and players). Multistrike is gonna be fun for passive proc-based classes, XD. Which has me wondering...if they balance it correctly, we could see dual stat priorities more often(and less 'stack mastery' mentality). Amplify for example has the potential to have huge synergy with classes that have close stat weights for Crit/Haste/Mastery...<br />
<br />
It's interesting now, seeing those secondaries from SoO, now it makes a lot of sense. The less popular, and more 'situational' trinkets are being made Tertiary stats, and the ones that were popular and well-regarded are being made into the new Secondaries. This may have been their plan for quite a while, test out the new stats via trinkets in SoO...</div></div><hr />

Either you didn't read the post or you have no reading comprehension at all. They are dumbing down the game to an insane degree.

<br />
It's the attempt to keep people raiding. People unsubscribe much quicker than they did in the past. They just look into the patch, complete its content (which other than heroic is extremely easy to do) and unsubscribe. With that system you will catch the ones that would murder for a BiS set. <br />
<br />
Some of that tertiary stats will probably never go live. AoE reduction for example. AoE has to be healable even when the raid has 0 AoE avoidance. So it either is such a substantial AoE reduce that its possible to trivialize AoE effects with it (which I doubt) or it will just be ignored. 3% saved AoE healing on one guy is nothing.</div></div><hr />

This is another problem. We have 32 people on our roster for our 25m and we rotate people in based on boss needs.

AoE damage reduction you can say isn't really that important for the most part (depending on scaling). So let's err on calling it flavor.<br />
<br />
Cleave... not flavor on many fights. It's actual damage and healing done.<br />
Run speed... useless on some fights but can be a godsend on others. Hint: This just makes it a godsend.<br />
<br />
Forgot one last one: Life Steal. For the most part, that's flavor (unless they screw up and have some 1000% damage taken mechanic in which case a healthy amount makes you an immortal).<br />
<br />
Every example you provided depends on the amount of stat provided. Do you know how much of the tertiary stat will be on an item? Or are you just assuming everyone at blizz is bad at math and will load so much of the tertiary stats on items that it will break the game?</div></div><hr />

About the new gear system: <br />
So we basically gonna gather gear the whole time? While hoping it's gonna be warforged, it has a gem socked, or it has a thirth stat on it?<br />

You realize that's called RNG, right? Which has always been the main factor in loot drops. The only way this would change is if they put all of the same drops up on a vendor and let you buy them with currency, so that eventually, if you're extremely unlucky with drops, you can buy all of the same gear for the time and effort you've put in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I propose the following changes to world PVP: <br />
<br />
1. PVP Resil and Power are gone. Save that OP garbage for RBGs and Arenas. <br />
2. All PVP combat interaction automatically scales the gear of all involved parties interactions to some lower level, say ((character level) / 2) * 10. So level 90s would be scaled to 450, level 100s get scaled to ilvl 500, etc. The formula doesn't really matter, the idea is to lower the gear level a bit and make PVP fights take a little longer. Only for PVP interactions though - PVE interactions would remain unscaled. <br />
3. No gear procs during PVP interactions. <br />
<br />
Next up: Dealing with griefers who attack you while you're tanking something (think world boss) - their damage comes in at a lower rate but if someone is healing you, is that other person's healing scaled? It would have to be. I suppose that'd be part of the penalty of playing on a PVP server. (So glad I no longer do!)</div></div><hr />

Hmm. Stats they're getting rid of you stack until you have x amount and then it does nothing and you needed reforging to juggle a magic number using addons, websites, or spreadsheets just to make the gear an upgrade at all. Stats they're adding don't count against the budget and give your character a little more power as a bonus. Apparently some people need the game dumbed down...</div></div><hr />

This.

How is it becoming more complicated? It either drops with additional stats/ilvl/socket or it doesn't. If that's what you call &quot;much more complicated&quot;.. I'd hate for you to see something that was actually more complicated, put it that way.<br />

Oh and fellow raid leaders/officers - don't be dense. There aren't too many options. Either you enforce people taking upgrades if they're upgrades, or you allow them to &quot;save up&quot; for the good pieces. It's pretty simple.<br />

Oh, and Thornrayne I strongly disagree. I think it'll be great having interesting loot drop throughout a tier, even when you have all the &quot;items&quot; you already want - still being able to find upgrades is always a good thing. Carrot on the stick, and all that jazz.</div></div><hr />

You're still going to see spreadsheets when Mr Robot or other gear checkers will expect you to have these 3rd stats min-maxed with your main stats to be an efficient raider. For example, if Life Steal is going to be good for tanks, Mr Robot and gear checkers will tell you to get it or buzz off. WoD is not making stats easier no matter how you see it.

<br />
Why are you comparing Secondary stats to Tertiary stats? Why not compare Hit/Expertise to the new Secondaries, Amplify, Multistrike, and Readiness? I don't get why you're trying to compare the Life Steal/Cleave stuff to Hit/Expertise... the 3 stats(+Bonus armor) are all stats that are going to be valuable 'after a cap', unlike Hit/Expertise, and in most cases, Dodge/Parry. They're going to still have 'weight', and thus not be as easily expendable as Hit/Exp. The thing that made Hit/Expertise appalling in my mind, even more so than the 'virtual hurdle' they provided, was that they were utterly worthless past a specific point, being over half the reason Reforge existed in the first place. Reforge was a 'band-aid' for a scourge in WoW, pointless cap stats, and now they're having the balls to actually fix the problem rather than just paint over it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Outside of cutting edge Heroic Progression, you don't have to 'min-max down to the wire'... I don't know what guilds you raid/have raided with, but just a general understanding and attempt to gear will get you into most normal raiding guilds, and some heroic ones. Tertiary are being aimed at 'nifty-side-bonus'(hell, it's apparent even by the name 'Tertiary'), so, with know one knowing exactly how strong or weak they are, all we have to go on is their word, which as I said, is tilted towards them being rare, but 'nice' little bonuses, and not worth dropping an ilvl tier or side-grading out of desired stats for.</div></div><hr />

Any guild that says you can't join without an item that takes on average 10 weeks to drop per raid isn't a guild I would want to app to. Remember, they're saying there's something like a 10% chance an item will have tertiary stats, there's not even a guarantee that the stat you're looking for will drop prior to the next tier. So like I said, I'd avoid the kind of stupid that would have to be present in a guild with that requirement.</div></div><hr />

See, that's exactly where you're missing the point. You're making assumptions about stats that you haven't seen the values on. Lifesteal was put into the game via a trinket in SoO(as were all the other Tertiary and secondaries), and guess what happened? It was ignored by tanks. Even at 3% overall lifesteal, it wasn't enough. Sure it was in a situation where it actually had 'weight', but the point remains, it wasn't so 'amazing' that tanks dropped whatever trinket they were rolling to go after this 'shiny new lifesteal' stat, hell some of them even outright avoided it even if they had a high tier version of it versus a low tier(Normal-Heroic Juggernaut's is still worse than LFR ToT trinkets).</div></div><hr />

Don't be silly to think guilds won't care if you have some bullshit, tertiary stats like Life Steal if you're a healer that doesn't have armor with healing-based, tertiary stats even if you know what you're doing (just throwing these stats names out as an example).

The normal unsocketed/non-tertiary gear that drops will be just fine to complete whatever raid it dropped from, etc.<br />

It's just the weird mindset of the WoW players, that makes them discard all suboptimal pieces as junk, even if the difference between them is something like 30 main stat, a value you never feel in the real world.<br />

The only thing I don't like is the change to the sockets. Ain't fun to be a jewel crafter, when sockets are super rare.<br />

Right, you don't have to be world first to say realize the value of hit cap.

Don't do that random stuff in wow, it doesnt work.<br />
<br />
The way they worded it, the extra stats only get rolled when you actually loot the item.<br />
So people will feel the need to bid on stuff they already have or wouldn´t otherwise need and hope to get the stats they need on it. <br />
<br />
Waste DKP, steal loot form others, spend weeks getting the same shit item hoping for a good proc. Either that, or the bonuses are so marginal that they don´t even have to put this complicated system in. Move the tertiary stats to proessions and they might work, but not like this RNG shit.</div></div><hr />

Almost all of your character power comes from primary and secondary stats which aren't random. Tertiary stats don't appear to be much more than flavor at this point. If you have any parses or even a sim that shows otherwise then feel free to show the class.<br />
<br />
Yea extra gems sockets more movement speed passive cleaves are flavor. In no way those stats can end up being useful. Only flavor making you feel good about yourself.</div></div><hr />

There are main attributes there that are useful for EVERYONE: Power gives more damage, Precision gives more crit chance, etc. Intellect, Agility and Strength are basically a sum of all those stats in GW2 with this new system. And that is awesome! Actually I see a lot of GW2's philosophy in their design lately. The personal loot system is all there is in GW2, and they are even talking about &quot;dynamic events&quot;, which was probably the biggest buzzword for GW2. <br />
<br />
Back to the gear: I think people that say &quot;OMG TOO MUCH RNG&quot; are missing a crucial thing here. Right now, when you kill a boss, there is a small chance that your item will drop. I reckon that with this new system, there is about a same chance of a &quot;very good&quot; item dropping for you (with, say, the suboptimal secondary/teriary stat combination), and a very small chance of a &quot;perfect item&quot;. And when before two spell agility items could drop, and all the rogues would be disappointed, with this system simply two &quot;leather&quot; items drop, and everyone can use it (be it a &quot;perfect&quot; item or a &quot;good&quot; item). Moreover, I think their intention is also that the &quot;perfect&quot; item is not something that is min/maxable (even though it probably will be maxed :( ).<br />
<br />
Concluding: I am not ready to have an opinion about this, but it looks promising and positively similar to GW2.</div></div><hr />

The other problem I see with this is, it's going to cause a lot more loot drama when the super special warforged+gem+tertiary item drops.

Right, the only issue I actually have with &quot;too much&quot; RNG is it (ironically) makes things rather boring. Extremely low (1%) drop rates are best saved for mounts or something that will last much longer than the tier.<br />
<br />
A carrot on a stick only feels so good until you realize you're just being muled around by a carrot on a stick.<br />
<br />
Edit: You can debate how different this is in absolute mechanics than Diablo III but end of the day I didn't touch Diablo III for over 1.5 years and only &quot;went back&quot; for this promised &quot;Loot 2.0&quot; recently because I was sick of being led by a carrot on a stick in circles. Yes the loot will be relatively a higher drop rate, but also it will only be farmable once a week. Seems like &quot;Loot&quot; is going back to &quot;1.0&quot; for Warcraft?<br />

The 1% drop rate mount is fine because that is something you'll have forever. It makes an old raid farmable even expansions down the road and gives groups incentives to &quot;go back&quot; to old raids whenever. It's not like the gear you get will even last you that long though.<br />

Yeah, I have a feeling they're going to be copying a lot of Guild Wars 2 ideas. They mentioned something about &quot;Troves&quot; and getting out in the world, so they'll probably add in jumping puzzles here and there. They already did similar with the pillars and hidden chests in Timeless Isle. You can say what you want bad about GW2, but the graphics and playstyle is pretty amazing. It's just hard for me to completely break away from WoW because I have so much invested in it and I'm so used to the diversity of the spells and abilities. Plus I don't feel like I HAVE to play GW2 since it's free to play. (Which coincidentally makes me FAR more likely to spend money in the cash shop. But that's a whole other can of worms!)<br />
<br />
I don't think the dynamic events will be as well done though. The tagging system in GW2 is a little more advanced, so I think their idea of dynamic events will be more similar to what we've already seen with the farmable rares on Timeless Isle and Isle of Thunder. I just don't see it being as fun for some reason but that could be due to the fact that GW2 has better in-game physics for combat. You can block or stand behind a tree and the fighting is a little more polished. In WoW you can use cooldowns, and get out of fire on the ground or kill adds on time.</div></div><hr />

don't forget since the new raid teir is flexible and gear drop % will increase with each player, it's still going to be roughly the same loot competition as now. the only difference is that you wont be DE'ing any pieces until way longer in the teir which means your group can get geared form each boss as opposed to watching that same damn piece drop every week that no one needs because they arent a bow wielding hunter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like how it is now, but i agree with some of the earlier reply s, it seems to me they are going backwards and opposite of what they are intending, so many issues that they are so short-sighted to see, how much it will change things, mostly for worse, with just a few tiny positives, and for no real good reason.<br />
<br />
I've always thought loot in wow should have gone to a token/point system, like how LOTRO did it, loot doesn't drop, it drops tokens and you take those tokens to choose the gear you want, simple.<br />
<br />
So instead of adding RNG to every drop, making every drop different every time, with the best rolls being so low you most likely wont ever see it, then just make all gear on a system where you get your base item, and then can enhance or upgrade said item, through professions or points, maybe valor, or a use for the useless justice points atm, something NEW not going backwards, or clunky RNG for every single drop like this, this is not the right solution at all.<br />
<br />
A mail agility item drops for my hunter, it has crit/mastery and i want haste. no problem go to vendor or some kind of ui panel, swap out 1 for the other (not reforge, a complete swap) or a gem socket, maybe have it so you get a new currency, when you get enough currency can use some of it to add gem slots, new stats or secondary stats to existing gear, that way...you have more customization and choice, rather than pure RNG hope for the best like they are wanting to do, makes no sense.<br />
<br />
I think the right way to go would be to drop base items, and then allow us to further customize gear through a few different means, knowing your class/spec/stats is what separates the average/casual from the pros and the good players, and those that do min/max and raid, its not to show off, but because they simply like to have the best gear possible, with this new system they are wanting to do, its going more torwards out of 10 players only 2 of them have perfect setup, vs 10 today, the gear will be so rare, but you will get so sick of running same boss hoping for same item but with a gem slot, and not getting it, getting same gear with speed instead of gem, that why bother?<br />
<br />
this wont make us play more, eventually we will play less cuz we wont even care to run it 100x to get each item perfect, so why even gate us like this? why take the effort to implement this if its going to not really improve anything? <br />
<br />
The only part i like is the gear switching on spec switch, but if the secondary stats don't change, then that's pretty much pointless too, cuz still have to have a 2nd set, to be optimal? its seriously not hard to force stats onto people, if that stat is determined to be the best, generally the stat don't change for entire expansion, like mastery for warlocks, pretty much has been best stat since mop launch right? why cant they say OK guys locks will use mastery? <br />
<br />
do they WANT us to pick wrong stat or think that by choosing the right stat it somehow makes people be/feel more pro? i think if they forced it on us, would be an improvement to everyone no more guessing game, or people not knowing what their best stat is.<br />
<br />
If they are going to do this, then why not just change up secondary stats, every class has a different secondary they focus on, and every spec within the same class even, survival hunters prefer crit, BM hunters like haste for example. Why is it so hard to just tie in a secondary stat based on a primary? agility will always rise as you get better gear right? make baseline haste rise as your gear improves, or make 1 new stat, that basically gives you your class/spec stat and put that 1 stat on gear, solved. Then when u switch specs, bam you have your main stat + correct secondary stat<br />
<br />
How many people stack another stat if they even have a clue which one to stack? If you know best is haste, its not like you can/will stack crit, just to be different, be gimping yourself? the illusion of choice is all it is. There is truly only 1 choice, the &quot;other&quot; stat atm (like crit vs haste) is just there to be different and change things up between drops for class/specs. Example i got 559 chest from ordos tonight, it has crit/mastery, i am a BM hunter, i focus on haste, ok so now that 559 chest is nice, i wouldn't end up using it, even if my chest is 548 (which also breaks my 4 piece...another story all together) because crit/mastery are not very optimal for BM. Sure its higher ilvl, but breaking my 4 piece and not optimal stats means lose more than gain.<br />
<br />
So basically have items with 1 main stat and 1 &quot;master&quot; secondary stat, that 2nd stat just changes depending on class/spec, haste/crit/mastery...why cant we all be optimal? the separation of good/bad players shouldn't be by the choices they make in gear, sure choices are good, but some choices are just illusions, in the end you will choose 1, and stack it, so why give us gear we don't want or need, its always been a waste, other than for disenchant/vendor fodder.<br />
<br />
At some point they may even try making gear that lasts several tiers, imangine getting a base item in tier 1, but through upgrades (ilvl/stats/sockets) you carry it with you, rather than swapping out every piece every tier, its something to ponder about.</div></div><hr />

There's some things they could do to make switching between specs for hybrids easier, having multiple sets of gear in your bag for both pvp and pve gets annoying. Never mind the constant reforging if, for example, you're switching from a high mastery healing set to a high haste dps caster set...<br />
