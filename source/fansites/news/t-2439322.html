<br />
Personally, it's always fun to watch the live panels and what not, but any pertinent information is available almost instantly, at least if they offer some good bonus things it makes paying that kind of money more worth while. I play Warcraft, we get a cloak and a flag? And there isn't an expansion being announced, it's much too soon. So for me, it just doesn't feel worth the price of admission. Just my opinion of course. :) I may reconsider after I see what the other games offer, but WoW is my focus. Hearthstone people though, that seems like a pretty great bonus for you guys. :D</div></div><hr />

Hearthstone always gets either a card back or a golden legendary. This is the first time they also give bonus packs. Which is nice IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That mount in WoW would have got me to buy the ticket,but since it's not that's some money saved.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalerender</div><div class="date">2018-10-10, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But why would you come from that perspective? That's like paying for movie tickets because you just want to watch a couple trailers.<br />
<br />
Because all the info is available elsewhere. Hell you can watch the opening ceremony without a ticket and see the big announcements and get the details as mmo-champ live blogs it. Or find live streams of it online.<br />
<br />
There's always been a murloc pet - mounts were a nice difference because it's something you can use continuously. Toys and a cloak mog (I've had my cloak turned off on my main for the last 5 years) are not. The other bonuses hold no interest for me, so at the end of the day I buy the blizzcon ticket for that WoW item really.<br />
<br />
Just this year I'm not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Idk... I remember buying 5 of my friends + myself movie tickets to go see YU-GI-OH &amp; the pyramid of light, because they gave out 1 of 4 exclusive cards per ticket, and I wanted them all.... Movie was okay but I really wanted the cards lol...<br />
<br />
That being said I'm more into blizzcon for the con, hype, and info rather then the goodies, and I also play all of blizzards games so I seem to do better then the average joe as it goes for free stuff...</div></div><hr />

An event of this type and scale should work pro bono as advertisement for their future releases. Also keeping in mind the state of WoW right now which equals to an alpha release whilst charging 13 euros a month in addition to the typical AAA-price tag it's humiliating for Blizzard to charge as much for virtual content as computer festivals do for physical attendance. Absolutely fucking disgusting behavior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There has only ever been a mount twice, and both those years we didnt get a murloc pet, but im glad a break from the murloc pets, i literally never used em.<br />
i rather very different stuff, instead of just &quot;what is the murloc gunna be this year...?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Need a pick and choose items you want. <br />
<br />
Goodie bag hold X number of items you can get and you can pick from say, 10 items from each franchise. This way, if someone wants all WoW stuff, they can and not have stuff they will never use just collecting virtual dust.</div></div><hr />

So while I get some say its not worth it, you gotta understand that for those who play the majority of the games, the price you pay is very considerable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this, I am a blizzard fan boy of sorts. I will get my moneys worth and am glad I have the various blizzcon goodies from previous years even if I don't play hearthstone/diablo/heroes/overwatch as much as I do wow. :P In any case, I just wish there was a bigger discount for virtual ticket holders for the goodie bag. It is nice however that they are letting everyone purchase a goodie bag though, I think they have done that for a few years now. :) <br />
<br />
Anyone else surprised there hasn't been a diablo blizzcon in-game item reveal yet??? #Diablo4 lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't matter how many games you play, all of the information is put up on their respective fan sites within 5 minutes, making the rewards the only thing really buying the VT for, which this years is very weak.<br />
<br />
Oh and on the note of multiple games / panels, don't they overlap the different games quite a lot so you couldn't watch both anyway? (unless you had the sound off on one stream...)</div></div><hr />

Awesome work Blizzcon, you just lost 2 buyers, 40 euro for a worthless tabard?? no mount no pet nothing to lure us to buy thicket? hearthstone? who cares? starcraft? Okkk, Diablo.. sure.. but Warcraft??? just that?? NO THANKS..!!! if next year respect the money of ppl and the love have shown so far to you then maybe I will think about to give you my real money for pixels.</div></div><hr />

Bli$$ard continue to seem to think they can charge what they wan't for basically flimsy content and gifts. You can bet they are currently working on their next milking strategy.</div></div><hr />

i coem from that perspective because i'm not going to bother watching any of the streams and everything covered will be on youtube within minutes of announcement. i have no justifiable reason to buy a vticket if it wasn't for the &quot;bonuses&quot;.</div></div><hr />
