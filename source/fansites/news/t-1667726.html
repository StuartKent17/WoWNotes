Warcraft III Fan Remake<br />
WarCraft: Armies Of Azeroth (https://www.facebook.com/pages/WarCraft-Armies-Of-Azeroth/414874548666571) is Starcraft II based fan remake of WarCraft III that adds new gameplay features. A gameplay video is apparently coming soon (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcioVsilAdw&amp;google_comment_id=z12bv10rpyueezybd04chltgfwykffsaiss0k).<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
This expansion made inventory management worse. Toy box was one step forward and all the new stuff 5 steps back.<br />
What new stuff are you having trouble fitting? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/546044237452546048))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
had a SoO lockout which I joined mid run, cleared to Garrosh. after leaving it said the first 3 bosses were available + Garrosh. few weeks later, extending the lockout, I kill Immerseus and now I have a lockout with only Immerseus dead. I suppose it has to do with lockouts being nothing more than loot locks nowadays, either way I think choosing to extend should mean you are deliberately choosing to get loot locked to these bosses you don't want to re-kill.<br />
Agreed - I think we have some work to do there to clean up the system. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/545978371474083840))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
big lore moment in highmaul with cho'gall restricted to mythic only. feel annoyed by this, shouldn't better items be enough?<br />
Not sure it qualifies as a 'big lore moment.' It's a neat fight, though! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/546020149229146112))<br />
<br />
Out of curiosity, how common is it for a Draenei to be named Exarch? Just did the quest chain with Yrel and found it interesting!<br />
At this time in Draenor there were exactly five Exarchs, &quot;The Hand of the Prophet.&quot; At least, they start with five... (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/546020766936883200))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
What ever happened to, followers would get a rare mission to run old raids to sometimes bring back transmog gear?<br />
Felt strange having them run old raids when they're supposed to be defending Draenor. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/545753136481062912))<br />
<br />
With the legendary follower. Is it a character that we already know of or is it an entirely new character?<br />
I'm not sure that a brand new character would feel legendary to people. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/545758419135655936))<br />
<br />
I'm really surprised our Garrisons didn't get decorated for the holidays.<br />
Def. would have been nice to have, it was on our wishlist to let you choose the holiday decoration set any time of year. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/546043560739364864))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
also I get the feeling that after @WarcraftDevs showed up you guys just don't talk anymore, which is sad <br />
With the release of WoD, there's a bit less to discuss atm I am thinking of making a crock pot of spiced cider. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/546043981432246272))<br />

<br />
I don't think it got worse, but as they made solutions, additional problems plagued it imo. There are 'toys' that aren't purely vanity like Sargerei Digsuise (makes you neutral to the Sargerei) and some items plain up eat more space like PvP broken bones and a handful of follower upgrades, the latter which I'm waiting to become BoA so i can give it to my alts as I have 15 650+ followers.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping some more items get converted to toys, and more importantly raid stuff like feasts and potions get more stack cap.</div></div><hr />

I do not think they are but it would be amazing if they did. The graphics are severely outdated and while I generally do not consider that enough to deter me for most games, something about these ones in particular does.</div></div><hr />

I just hope Blizzard is secretly making a Warcraft 4 (rts), I don't care what the story is so much as I just want a new warcraft RTS.<br />
I mean think of the possibilities with all the stuff we have now... So fun.<br />

<br />
It is a problem. Non-toy toys, 12 types of follower upgrades... I thought the materials stuff was nice since i can just put stacks in the bank and craft using banked ores and herbs; however, this didn't solve enough problems compared with how many new items created. I have the same amount of bag room in this xpac as I did in previous ones...which isn't very much.</div></div><hr />

As far as I know, that's not a policy. I saw an interview around Blizzcon where they even said Warcraft IV is something they often think about, and is something they might consider doing after the team is done with Starcraft II.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard's SC art team is actually making updated versions of all the Warcraft III units for use with the Galaxy Editor.<br />

<br />
No it's not. The point of LFR was to open raids to broad audience so that the resources and time put into their creation could be justified. The extra phase required close to none extra time and resources.</div></div><hr />

Not sure it qualifies as a 'big lore moment.' It's a neat fight, though! (DaveKosak)<br />
<br />
Seriously ? I mean SERIOUSLY ? sure at some point those of us that are just playing the story line will be able to go back and stamp all over mythic to see the outcome of Cho'gall, but to have it locked behind mythic difficulty is disgusting. The story should be for everyone, the better loot / mounts for those that push the harder content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This WC3 &quot;remake&quot; is made through Starcraft II's map editor, available to anyone. Why would they issue cease and desists over something they have absolute control over?</div></div><hr />

It's coming from David Kosak...I'm not even sure he knows what game he's working let alone the lore of the current expansion</div></div><hr />

I saw an interview around Blizzcon where they even said Warcraft IV is something they often think about, and is something they might consider doing after the team is done with Starcraft II.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard's SC art team is actually making updated versions of all the Warcraft III units for use with the Galaxy Editor.<br />

I don't know why, but part of me is just begging for the option for your character in WoW to go in as a hero, I remember seeing some wow models in Starcraft customs, but not sure how hard that would be to do.<br />
<br />
Still, the idea of importing your character for some RTS kickass seems amazing to me.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard stopped caring about the lore ages ago when they insisted on stuffing it in books written by third parties and selling it instead of giving it to us for free.</div></div><hr />

Ah, OK. I've never particularly liked WC3 melee gameplay (played a lot of custom maps though), but I would love to play through the campaigns once more on a new engine. SC1 campaigns remake for SC2 was amazing, and hopefully they will offer something like that with WC3 and, possible, WC1/WC2 later on.</div></div><hr />

Sad but true... I have seen this happen to many ´remakes´ over the years. They look like they have made so much progress, then it just falls apart.</div></div><hr />

I had completely forgotten that, that is what happens to these projects. I am really glad you mentioned that because I was letting my excitement get the better of me.</div></div><hr />
