Peacebloom Vs. Ghouls<br />
A lot of people wondered what the &quot;Peacebloom vs. Ghouls&quot; achievements from the latest beta build are and we finally have an answer. Have you ever played Plants vs. Zombies (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs_zombies)? No? Cataclysm will give you a chance to fix that! A new quest was added to the game in the latest beta build, it's a brand new mini-game heavily based on Plants vs Zombies and I'm sure a lot of players will waste an insane amount of time on it. <br />

WoWTal - Build 12984<br />

Running Wild / No Worgen Mounts<br />
This isn't a matter of saving time. The animations still had to be made in order to make this feel cool.<br />
<br />
It's a matter of preference and creating an immersive gameplay experience. Giving the worgen a distinct creature to ride just didn't feel right, but they can still ride other mounts if they meet the criteria. Right now we're okay with the fact that this particular race is different when it comes to mounts. We feel that makes it interesting, even if the Alliance gets less racial mounts as a result. There are plenty of mounts out there and we can always add more. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850256683/running-wild/))<br />

Saturday PTR/Beta Patch and bugs<br />
We didn't have people working Saturday so we could push the patch. People were working Saturday so we decided to push the patch. Given how much work is going into this expansion right now, many changes are added to the system seven days a week. It is better that we collect those changes by creating new builds and releasing them to test the content, at this point, than it is to thoroughly bug test each new build internally. We know it can create various issues each new patch which can be sort of rough on testers, but we appreciate you working through these things with us because it's helping to shape Cataclysm to be the best expansion possible. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859147653/no-changes-to-thunder-bluff-at-all/))<br />
<br />
Stats balancing<br />
As an almost universal rule, we don't want to solve &quot;I don't like that stat&quot; problems by just not making gear with that stat. The eventual result of such a design would be that all of your gear looks alike. That's a problem WoW has in general, so we like to actually get the most out of what few stats we have.<br />
<br />
Several players could get in a state where they were hit capped in LK and then just kept getting more and more hit on higher level items. We are trying to fix that this time around in a number of ways:<br />
<br />
1) Making all stats more attractive, rather than having the good stat vs. the garbage stat.<br />
2) Getting rid of so many passive hit buffs, such as the draenei racial and class raid buffs.<br />
3) Requiring higher combat ratings for additional content tiers. What hit caps you for 4.0 won't be sufficient in 4.1, so the extra budge on the 4.1 gear will be helpful.<br />
4) Reforging. If all else fails and you just find yourself over the hit cap (or over-enriched in any other stats) you can remove part of the less desirable stat.<br />
<br />
In all of these cases I'm talking about stats that actually show up on your gear. It's fine if mages don't care about Agi or warriors don't care about Spirit. But crit, haste and mastery should be universally desirable, and one of those should not trump the other two by being 2x more valuable. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859146834/caster-hit-trinkets-cata-edition/))<br />
<br />
Healing (I strongly suggest reading the whole post about healers (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850276572/better-pr-needed-by-blizzard/))<br />
Medium Heals Nerf<br />
As others have pointed out, we nerfed all of the medium heals.<br />
<br />
Very early in beta, some healers were freaking out about running out of mana. To counter this, we made the medium heals really cost effective. We probably overdid it, because more recently, healers were able to handle almost everything with just that one heal. We want it to be part of your package, not your whole package. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859187219/seriously-nerf-nourish/))<br />
<br />
Is it intended that our efficient heals only have about 20% more HPM than our big heals? Or should we expect those to be nerfed as well soon?<br />
If healers stop casting the medium heals completely, then it's likely we nerfed them too far. Up until this change they weren't using the big heals enough.<br />
<br />
We had the numbers set at what we thought made sense from a cost per benefit standpoint, but reality is always a little more complicated. Perhaps it was just easier using a single heal and being a B+ healer rather than having to worry about which of multiple heals to use in order to be an A+ healer. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859187219/seriously-nerf-nourish/))<br />
<br />
Big Heals<br />
The big heals get a decent amount of use, and they don't seem to run players out of mana unless the rest of the group is taking unnecessary damage (by say ignoring all the encounter mechanics because they can do so when running Heroic Nexus today).<br />
<br />
If there's a heal we're worried about, it's the flash heals, but that's partially because so many of the talented or spec heals are also emergency heals that fill a similar niche -- things like Swiftmend, Penance and Holy Shock. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859187219/seriously-nerf-nourish/))<br />
<br />
Triage<br />
You're fortunate if you have to triage. Many healers don't today. The typical experience is to use your fastest heal on everyone who takes any damage. You may get some amount of triage by choosing who to heal, but you won't be losing that either. If you are really choosing today which of your many heals to use, then A) you're in the minority, and B) you won't really have to relearn things for Cataclysm. You'll be ahead of the game.<br />
<br />
The Lich King game today has additional problems. Since overhealing doesn't matter, mana regen doesn't matter. Since overhealing is typical, large heals also don't matter, which means critical heals are often wasted. This makes two of the stats that appear on your gear (Spirit and crit) not attractive, which in turn makes the minigame of choosing which piece to use and how to gem and enchant them less compelling as well.<br />
<br />
If you just really think it's fun to just cast one heal over and over with no real repercussions for doing so while stacking a single stat on all your gear, then I guess I'll just have to accept that. It's hard for us to understand why you find that satisfying though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850276572/better-pr-needed-by-blizzard/))<br />
<br />
Healing spam<br />
When we say &quot;spammy&quot; in this context, we mean using the same spell over and over. We're not talking about sitting around on your hands waiting for your mana to come back (and without the five second rule, that won't do much for you anyway).<br />
<br />
Think of playing a healer like a real time strategy game. In the Lich King environment, your strategy is basically to crank out infantry as fast as you can and never let up. No matter what your opponent does, your job is to counter him with infantry. It doesn't matter what kinds of units he makes or whether he's going for a fast or slow buildup. Just make infantry. If your race has upgrades that affect things other than infantry, obviously they are of no use to you and you should ignore them. Cost is largely irrelevant too, since you are making one solider over and over.<br />
<br />
In the Cataclysm environment, we want you to make a variety of units. Sometimes infantry will do the job well. Other times you may need to mix in some cavalry or siege units as well. In fact, you need to tailor what you're making to the environment. Sometimes you want cheap units. Sometimes you want expensive ones. We want you to consider your upgrades as well. Investing all of them on infantry will make less sense because you have other types of units as well. Yet you won't have enough resources so you'll have to make a decision.<br />
<br />
That is really what we're trying to get out of the new healing model: making decisions. We think players have more fun when they are making decisions. When you make the right decision based on the information available, you feel smart. When you make the wrong decision, you feel dumb, and you might cause the rest of the group to have to work harder, or even ultimately cause a wipe.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is investing a lot into this change... they must have better reasons then that! I want them to sell it! Front page headline &quot;New Improved Healing System&quot;. If they can't do that, then maybe they should question all the hard work they are doing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850276572/better-pr-needed-by-blizzard/))<br />
<br />
[...] For the most part, you'll still be constantly casting. We do want to buy a little bit of bandwidth though. Making decisions takes actual time (fractions of seconds perhaps, but still time). In the LK healing environment even if you had a variety of effective healing spells, by the time you looked at someone's bar, decided what heal would be most appropriate, and started to cast it, the dude could very well be dead.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, large health pools will keep most players up for a few hits. That gives you the opportunity to decide if someone needs a little heal or a big heal, or a slow heal or a fast heal, or if they are likely to live long enough for a powerful spell to finish its cooldown. If you use the wrong spell, the target is unlikely to die immediately, but over time you'll realize that your mana has really started to dwindle and the boss has a large health bar still left.<br />
<br />
I've said this before, but I remember when tanking back in vanilla, a priest would call out on Vent, announcing that he had a big Greater Heal being cast. Other healers might call out when they were healing someone who suddenly took a lot of unexpected damage. That kind of coordination is very hard in today's raids because you'd only get through the B in &quot;Big heal coming,&quot; before the target would be dead.<br />
<br />
It's possible to slow down combat enough to provide room for decision making and communication without going to the extreme where healers are doing nothing for large stretches of time because they are so paranoid about running out of mana if they cast a heal that isn't at 100% efficiency or doesn't save a life at that moment. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850276572/better-pr-needed-by-blizzard/))<br />
<br />
Healer mana efficiency in solo<br />
Keep in mind that we're not super concerned with healer mana efficiency when not in a group. Fights are pretty short when you're solo and there are a lot of breaks. What I'm getting at is we're not super concerned with how you perform when self-buffed, so long as you're functional. We're more concerned with how you perform when group buffed, since all of the most rewarding endgame content requires groups.

Val'anyr competitive @ LVL 85?<br />
Let's put it this way... if it is competitive at level 85, it won't be for long. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850256341/val-anyr-and-cata-still-worth-it-lvl85/))<br />

Runic Empowerment<br />
We think Runic Empowerment is an important mechanic because without it, the rotation becomes very predictable perhaps even metronome-like. We are trying to make sure all specs have some random mechanics so that they need to react to what happens instead of just pressing the same buttons over and over as fast as they can. Some players react badly to random mechanics because they make the rotations less predictable and therefore more challenging to manage. That's the entire point.<br />
<br />
However, coming out of LK, Frost had a more random rotation that was more about priorities than set rotations, and Unholy was the opposite. This let players gravitate towards the play style they preferred and made the specs feel more different when you swapped from one for the other (more than just replacing Frost damage with Shadow damage). We are working on an Unholy talent that will essentially turn off the Runic Empowerment system in place of something more predictable, like the runes just refreshing more quickly. Ideally the talent would be optional, so that Unholy DKs could stick with Runic Empowerment if they prefer it. It will still require you to keep on your toes a little bit rather than letting you know for certainty what buttons you will be hitting at second 148 a battle.

Replenishment on Lifebloom<br />
We gave Replenishment to Restoration because we took it away from Survival hunters. It didn't make a lot of sense for a non-mana class to offer mana. We want to make sure Replenishment is easily available, though to be fair it is about half as effective as it was in Lich King.

Protection Damage / Shield Slam damage nerf<br />
We also buffed Revenge back to a 30% coefficient. We weren't trying to nerf Prot's damage overall -- just make sure that the other attacks actually did something besides consume GCDs waiting for the next Shield Slam.<br />
<br />
We're happy with Heavy Repercussions. It lets you use a defensive cooldown offensively when you don't need it defensively.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure it makes sense for Heroic Leap to hit harder than anything else a Prot warrior could do. It might make you want to do things like move out of melee and leap back in all the time. It might make you use a utility ability only for dps. (I don't think that's the same thing as Shield Block, because you're not literally giving up its defensive uses with Heavy Repercussions.)

This is the elemental expansion, so it needs to have a elemental feeling to it to, or what? ;)<br />
<br />
I like the Elemental and Ethereal (http://www.wowwiki.com/Gava%27xi) feeling to the Rogue Tier. <br />
<br />
The Ethereal feelings fits good, it is most likely meant to fit the arabic Skywall theme, both because of the tiers name, and that the ethereals are resembeling the Arabic.<br />

you have to laugh, i mean this is the blizzard that within the last 3 years has destroyed everything bar looks that make the horde and alliance different. From companion pets, mounts to the shaman/paladin. Come on they even added mounts to the horde so we'd have the same number. The &quot;plenty of mounts&quot; seems very excusey like the fact they can't do PUG rated BGs but all the tools are there, which ghostcrawler actually admitted on serveral occassions even contadicting himself at one point.

i hope they give alliance mounts, or at least the worgen faction gets something in the way of mounts. Otherwise it's just stupid... why can't hunters train feral worgens then.. damnit i wanna be a mount with a pet worgen with the name &quot;mywife&quot;.

Don't know if you realize, but the Raven tag on those pics isn't actually a name for either set. Names are in the post though :)<br />
<br />
Really, REALLY looking forward to the PvZ mini-game. Showed my gf that earlier and she's stoked too.<br />
<br />
I am liking the Druid set. Not sure about Rogue set yet. I agree it has the look of an unfinished Shaman set, but since I don't play a Rogue any higher than 25, I won't worry too much about it ;) Hope that we get the rest of the sets to preview soon, and that the Paladin set isn't another letdown.<br />
<br />
So, Blizzard makes an extra effort to balance the number of mounts available to the 2 factions, then just throws that out the window with the Worgen? I'm a mount collector so that upsets me, but I think I'm more upset about not seeing the bear-pig thingy make it in game. Maybe they'll add in someplace else? Hope so, that thing was awesome ...</div></div><hr />

noone who cares about the GAME itself, and not just collectable whoring, care AT ALL about this. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZeroWashu</div><div class="date">2010-09-20, 10:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They need to stop dicking around with healing.<br />
<br />
Lets see, the problem with the new heals is that I don't need more buttons to press. Most healers work the same, class special heal (think Earth shield/penance/beacon/swift), fast heal, big heal, some group heal (well, ok, not Paladins until recently), and various tool spells.<br />
<br />
One hand can cover those four positions just nicely. Throw in another heal and what do I have? Worse, the new heal (tried it on pally/shaman/priest) really just gets worse each &quot;patch&quot;. For five man content I doubt the new heal is even worth my time except out of combat. The mana savings just doesn't cut it, its too low in power compared to the big heal and even has less ability than the flash heals. <br />
<br />
the reason they are having such difficulty getting it balanced is because its redundant. Adding a new heal spell will not suddenly separate the A healer from the B healer, it will just frustrate too many who try to fit in in.<br />
<br />
So glad they did such a great job making druids now feel as if they should not rejuv the universe, oops, nope they didn't do that either.</div></div><hr />

Well at least your set doesn't sound like something a blacksmith could make. Reinforced Sapphirium... It sounds like you have to go back and kill Sapphiron to get it.<br />
<br />
As for the healer thing, it looks like I'll be binding my medium heal and big heal to my mouse instead of my small and medium. The way I see it, you can make us use small/medium or medium/big, you can't make us use all three. One for a large amount of damage, one for a smaller amount, with the smallest heal being used for whatever spare damage is after the fight, when mana and total healing doesn't matter. Now that's not saying we're not going to use all of our other, more situational heals (AoE, instant cast, etc.) but our most basic heals, we're probably only be going to use 2 of the 3 of them the most.</div></div><hr />

no shaman would ever wear such awful thing.... you know, we are awesome which basically means we can't have have a bad looking T11<br />
Just look at any Tier shaman armor except T9 (which imo still looks better than the hunter counterpart) and admit that we'd be crippled by wearing a T11-rogue-looking set.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duster505</div><div class="date">2010-09-20, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To me it looks they are actually not making a &quot;new and improved healing system&quot;. They are taking it back many years and forcing things upon ppl. The strangest thing of it all - is that they are trying to make simple things complicated. Healing should NOT be more complicated than other parts like dps and tanking. Tanks dont use 5 diffrent spells situatinally to counter content - and defently not on 25 mobs.... DMG classes use simple rotation dmg systems that automaticly makes them an &quot;A+&quot;. Why on earth force one class to think of multiple things to handle while others pick their nose ? <br />
<br />
Now... lets see... Healers are controlling:<br />
<br />
Keeping ppl alive<br />
Using right spell to keep ppl alive<br />
using right spell to not run out of mana<br />
Hit mana regen buttons to regain mana <br />
Watching out for enviromental threats<br />
And did I mention they are often watching 5-15 ppl to keep alive?<br />
Add some extra elements like for paladins now where holy power is added on top of mana to make it extra confusing. <br />
Now... Add 3-5 hours + 3-7 days per week on top of this and you will get 90% of burned out healers that DONT get the chance to enjoy the CONTENT of the game like tanks and dps classes. Those classes are actually fighting the enviroment. Helers are fighting buttons and bars 24/7 - and now added on top of that - mana.<br />
<br />
I look at these changes with horrors... specially when I read about comments from devs talking about some priests in vanilla announching they are casting big heals... Do these guys not realise whe are no longer with 40 ppl raids and we have much less options to work with ? Or are they really forcing upon ppl to have a rotational healing with 5 - 7 healers in 25 man content? Im sorry but there is just nothing &quot;new and improved&quot; about it. It sounds bad.<br />
<br />
Again - Blizzard are throwing the difficulty balance soely on the healers atm. They are adding new and complicated mecanics to the class while other class roles are doint their ususal rotations and picking their nose. Thats just not acceptable. And I think BLizzard will find out soon enough that even more ppl will go dps and even tanking - rather than playing the complicated healing class that gets all the blame when things go wrong.</div></div><hr />

Healers who moan about running out of mana are afraid that ppl will notice that they astually suck when they cant spamm 1 button 15min.<br />
<br />
now there is another issue that Blizzard is continuously ignoring.<br />
Thats a CLONE issue.<br />
<br />
I see there are 3 sets with only difference in color.<br />
They are keeping WotLK system which is totally fail system.<br />
I as disco priest in 277 do not want to look exactly the same as shadow priest in 251. Not to mention there are offset items that look, again, THE SAME so i can be a clone of locks and mages wearing them.<br />
System get 1st set then upgrade it by changing color is a stupid stupid idea and shows lack of interest in player base needs and comments. <br />
Why is that?<br />
Im sure fury warriors dont want to look like tanks, or druids like boomkins. At least they could do is to add a little upgrades that clearly states &quot;i raid HM,or hard content&quot; or something. Bot just a freaking color. I dont want do wear the same set for 6 months ffs.<br />
<br />
Lemme refer to you to a thread going on EU forums regarding that (there is link in there for US forums too):<br />
Edit: It seems i cant post links until i post a few times but thread is in blizzard forum/cataclysm/ vanity slots gear 2 ( not discussing only about that but vanity but all kinds of armor diversity)<br />
<br />
We could use all the support we can get, Blizz cannot ignore is players for too long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty much in agreement here also. Typically making things harder involves more damage to the tank, or more AoE damage, or both. Which then falls on the shoulders of the healers to &quot;fix everything faster&quot;. <br />
<br />
I used to heal in the &quot;downranking&quot; days, so I'd like to say I'm at least familiar with kind of what style blizzard is going for, but that doesn't really make it any more comforting. <br />
<br />
Really, what they almost need to do to make things more difficult is to a) make puddles of death (You stand in puddle for more than 3 seconds, you are dead, outright dead. No massive health loss, no % loss of health over time, you stand in fire, and you die) so that they can't blame the healer and b) enrage timers. That way the healers aren't neccessarily banging their head against the wall every encounter. I am pretty worried that, since I've been a tank for so long, I'll have to retire that and go back to healing because good healers may be even more scarce than normal.<br />
<br />
Also, Plants vs Zombies? In MY WoW? It's like my two worst obsessions combined. This is awful and fantastic at the same time. Fantastiawful.<br />
<br />
Also also, I think the druid set looks great, and the rogue one may look better after it's properly implimented, seems like theres a few glowing effects that may be off.<br />
Also, it seems like it'd look great if you just turn off the helm. So it's just like Tier 8 basically for rogues.<br />
<br />
Folks implying that the sets are &quot;so bad/awful/looks like they let their kids design it&quot; are really going a bit overboard. These are only two of the sets, only one looks questionable, and doesn't every round of Tier gear have at least one medicore set compared to the others? Deep breath, folks. I'm sure they'll be fine.</div></div><hr />

It's probably like the WotLK setup - different color for heroic gear, for the off-set gear (IE, a piece of gear that's not actually tier but has equivalent stats), and then the regular set of gear.<br />
<br />
Since there's no longer a difference in 10/25 ilevel they don't need the extra color set to differentiate between those two levels, also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly, I -like- the new healing model. I've been healing for about 6 years on my paladin in endgame content, and WotLK was hands down the -worst- healing the game has to offer. The skill involved is minimal. All you do is pick your best heal (Disc bubble, Holy CoH/renew, Resto tree Rejuv/WG, Restosham CH, Holypal HL or FoL (if your thick)), and push it on anyone and everyone that takes damage. Yes, you may push other buttons every now and then, but at the end of the night, one heal takes home gold in the % of use olympics. Its less surgical, and more &quot;Here is your heal bat. Smack your raid with it&quot;. Healing should be about using an appropriate heal for an appropriate situation. In the context of Wrath, this is impossible, because the time between 100% and dead is a few seconds, tops. Assuming damage lightens up a bit and you have more time before a player is dead, the new model makes the game much more fun, and calls for you to use the right tool to fix a problem.<br />
<br />
Back in BC, there was a quote I loved about holy paladins. &quot;If a pally wants to drive a nail, he hits it with a hammer. If he wants to saw a plank, he hits it with a hammer, only harder.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I do not have any real problem with the bonus procing off it but the duration is only 30 seconds and that means needing to mangle twice as often. I think it would be better to proc off of the finisher abilities or have a proc icd off of shred. or have the duration last 61 seconds so the druid doesnt need to mangle as often.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaerix</div><div class="date">2010-09-20, 06:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty much in agreement here also. Typically making things harder involves more damage to the tank, or more AoE damage, or both. Which then falls on the shoulders of the healers to &quot;fix everything faster&quot;. <br />
<br />
I used to heal in the &quot;downranking&quot; days, so I'd like to say I'm at least familiar with kind of what style blizzard is going for, but that doesn't really make it any more comforting. <br />
<br />
Really, what they almost need to do to make things more difficult is to a) make puddles of death (You stand in puddle for more than 3 seconds, you are dead, outright dead. No massive health loss, no % loss of health over time, you stand in fire, and you die) so that they can't blame the healer and b) enrage timers. That way the healers aren't neccessarily banging their head against the wall every encounter. I am pretty worried that, since I've been a tank for so long, I'll have to retire that and go back to healing because good healers may be even more scarce than normal.<br />
<br />
Yea, I'm a bit fearful of the impending healing changes. I've done all 3 roles on my Paladin in the current raids of the time, and realized that as Holy I spend the most time staring at my raid UI instead of the actual game. As a tank or DPS, I at least have the ability to look at the environment without deadly consequences, but as a healer my time breaks up to about 70% Staring at Raid UI, 10% Running out of Raid Damage, 20% DPSing/Doing nothing because I don't need to heal (XT's heart phase, Icehowl's stun from charge, etc.). If I don't focus on the UI when just the tank is taking damage, he usually dies because I missed a heal by about 0.3 seconds. Yea, healing burns me out much faster than Tanking or DPSing. And when things go wrong, guess who gets blamed. DPS stands in fire? HEALER SHOULD HAVE HEALED ME! Tank doesn't pop cds when the boss uses a big attack? HEALERS SHOULD HAVE SAVED ME!<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just bitter but healers have always seemed to get the hardest job and the least amount of credit. A tank does superior tanking, he gets &quot;good job&quot;. A dps does an incredible amount of damage, he gets &quot;nice work&quot;. A healer saves the group from a wipe, he gets &quot;Well if you healed better we wouldn't have even been in danger.&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, I'm really hoping they don't muck up the Paladin t11, although I have a strong suspicion it will be blue in color.<br />
<br />
Lastly, I hope the Singing Sunflower pet you get from the PvG game will sing http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0N1_0SUGlDQ like TB says.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's just what you learn to accept as a healer, even though you can link that X died from 2 40k attacks from the boss and there was no way to save them as that was more than their total hp. Hopefully healing assignments will make a return along with healer communication, which is something I've really missed in WOTLK. As it is now, healing assignments normally don't go out until the important people die a couple of times. In classic and TBC we had a healing channel for the raid in which we would discuss who was buffing which group, who was healing whom, and if it was an endurance fight we would set up a healing rotation so the healers would get time to regen. If there were problems it was discussed in the healing channel instead of some tirade in raid/vent. <br />
A big downside to a possible return to complex healing is the return of tunnel vision aka Grid-lock, where you just see the raid ui of group members and don't really see what's going on around you. My best example of this is in classic and I got lost in MC as I had never really got to look around the place, just watch health bars.<br />
<br />
As blizzard has put in many talents where the healer can dps and get mana, haste, heal someone for the damage of the smite etc, it makes me think there will be a few fights where healers can do some dps, or may even need to do dps in the case of talents that restore mana during a fight.</div></div><hr />

That is to me the worst part of playing healer, you never get to see the awesome boss or the nifty graphics in his spells. A healer sees a bunch of green bars and thats it. For a healer wow could easier be a this (http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/2/5/).</div></div><hr />

Those talents are all fail. I've tried, and I cant hit anything on my resto shaman. Unless they want to go in and give us hit bonuses based on spirit or something (deep in healing trees), they're complete and total fail, you only waste more mana missing and not healing.</div></div><hr />

People that are that upset should really be concerned for themselves :P I, for one, support the running wild. I think it's a really neat mechanic, and you DON'T HAVE TO USE IT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

Zaerix, Riboflavin, I agree entirely with your sentiment. I know they have said in the past they wanted to &quot;avoid&quot; that healer tunnel-vision, but it's really... hard to do that, even with what changes they've added thus far with the UI (which is apparently just a now Grid-like interface).<br />
I do like a challenge, so I will probably end up going back to healing once Cata raiding starts up. I just hope it isn't a ludicrous ramp-up from what I've been used to.</div></div><hr />

The point of adding a new race isn't 5-6 mounts you'll never use because everyone already rides them, and achievements such as Mountain of Mounts is just a generic number. Furthermore, there's already tons of new cool mounts being added, such as that amazing lion and those cool reputation dragons.<br />
<br />
Game feel is what matters. Worgens are werewolves. It's pretty darn awesome they can utilize their speed to run as fast as a mount. As an upcoming Worgen player, that's just something I'll be looking so much forward to - and that's what really matters.</div></div><hr />

Well your choice of classes for your example answers your question. If we put, say, +Int and +Spi on Shammy gear, what will Enhance Shammies think?<br />
It would be easy enough to tailor the bonuses that way, but primary stats won't work for &quot;full&quot; hybrids (Druids, Shamans, and Paladins). You couldn't even really fudge it by changing your &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; stat based on spec. Casters really need to get Int, Spirit, and Stam on gear, Phys and Melee DPS want *either* Agi or Str (but not both), then Stam. There's not even the same number of stats to work with.<br />
<br />
Edit: And *really* DPS casters would rather not have spirit, though it won't be awful for them if the plan to use it as hit proceeds. So there's even more differentiation there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You saying that dps and tanks are more challenging atm than healers? Cause they are not. Healing is more challenging in WOTLK than ever before in terms of staying focused. Do the wrong thing and a player dies. That is ... in a hard enough content. ATM the problem is that noone can die since some healing classes dont have the tools to handle it in 5 man (so they have to be extra easy). This ofc leads to AOE and no need for CC content that are even more easy for the AOE healers. <br />
<br />
There is nothing hard or complicated about healing. It just takes much more out of ppl than tanking and damaging. Now Blizzard is focusing on making healing much more complicated for the sake of balancing the DIFFICULTY of the content. The progress of Cata is gonna be based soly on healing ability and it will lead to more ppl quitting healing than those that come back to it. We are no longer in Vanilla with 40 ppl raids. We are in 25 man raids and assigning healers sounds like smart idea for some content....exept that it doesn't work no more cause alot of movement and beeing out of range is now part and parcel of the game. <br />
<br />
Blizzard really need to refocus their effort on healing and realise that watching bars 99% of the time is not fun. They havn't change that. Now they have just added one more bar that needs to be watched more than before - and thats the mana bar. <br />
<br />
What happens if a DPS class runs out of mana? What happens if a Tank class runs out of mana (after 10 sec of fighting)? And... what happens if the healer runs out of mana? And who asks why the healer is running out of mana ? Maybe cause he needs to heal much more than he should have cause the dps and tank are taking more dmg than they should - IF they watched out for not taking extra dmg ? <br />
<br />
Why not let the dps classes start watching the threat meters more ? Or tanks ? Holding treat now is like taking a pee... its effortless after you start (for most) - stealing threat is almost impossible... I dont see any dps classes having to watch their big dmg spells to prevent taking agro in 2 or 3 hits... Why not... Why is ALL the content balanced ONLY on the healers ?<br />
<br />
WHat happens if a DPS class hits the wrong dmg button ? Absolutly nothing. What happens if the tank hits the wrong threat button ? Absolutoly nothing ? What happens if the healer hits the wrong healing button ? Everything....<br />
<br />
Holding agro should be hard - doing dmg without pulling agro should be hard. Healing should not be any harder than those two. THIS was the reality in Vanilla. If ppl want to take healing back to Vanilla - then why on earth not punish everyone for hitting the wrong buttons ?</div></div><hr />

He said DAMAGE button. Last time I checked, taunts aren't in the normal rotation for a DPS. Meanwhile, if a DPS actually does hit a wrong damage button, nothing bad happens. At worst, they lose a small portion of DPS for a few seconds or blow a cd at the wrong time. If a healer hits a small heal instead of a big heal, or a big heal too late, the tank gets flattened and either you wipe or the off tank picks it up after a few dps and healers have already been killed and you wipe anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1st If u missclick on healing u totally fail, healing atm only needs 1-2 buttons.<br />
2nd If u press the wrong heal the tank will just use a deffensive cooldown and u can make up for the error that u made (not that big of a deal)<br />
3rd A dps like a dk might need to taunt something with deathgrip in the middle of the fight and instead he might taunt the boss gg wipe<br />
4th A dps might want to taunt an add to save healers when tanks are 2 slow or cant do it at that time giving time between the mob walking from the healer to the dps for the tank to taunt.<br />
5th Dps and tanking are important but however are extreamly easy to do well due to gear (despite that i still see ppl failing) and the same can be said for healers with r infinite mana. I mean whats the point of having mana if it isnt used up why not give healers energy? In other words tanking dps and healing is all the same button spamming atm.<br />
6th If a dps missclicks a cooldown or smth might ruin the raid because there wasnt enough dps on a special mob or phase that was needed to take down fast.<br />
7th Tanking isnt only sit there and spam taunt. You need to position the boss, the better you are at doing this the smoother the raid will go.<br />
8th WOTLK healing is bs atm.<br />
<br />
If u dont like this change just reroll srsly. Challenging is supposed to make the game FUN.</div></div><hr />

Got the kodo on my first try with my priest and the ram on the first try with my hunter. My hunter also got the remote and the mace in the same bag. My 2nd alt got the shanker. I've already seen many people on kodo's and rams in Dalaran. Droprate seems to be ok :)</div></div><hr />

Oh look, I can play this game too!<br />
<br />
He said DAMAGE button. Last time I checked, taunts aren't in the normal rotation for a DPS. Meanwhile, if a DPS actually does hit a wrong damage button, nothing bad happens. At worst, they lose a small portion of DPS for a few seconds or blow a cd at the wrong time. If a healer hits a small heal instead of a big heal, or a big heal too late, the tank gets flattened and either you wipe or the off tank picks it up after a few dps and healers have already been killed and you wipe anyway.<br />
<br />
Kind of like how a DPS responsible for an appropriate CC or kick can just as easily wipe the raid? Or when a DPS stands in the wrong spot / doesn't move fast enough / hits the wrong add and kills himself or others causing an enrage wipe / a healer or tank to get killed?<br />
<br />
Someone hasn't fought Heroic Lich King</div></div><hr />

So are you suggesting that blizzard should make the whole game like Heroic Lich King, because then i think 80% of healers would stop healing, except the few that actually do fight Heroic Lich King.</div></div><hr />

No, a taunt is not in a DPS rotation. But, with keybinds or even clickers, if you have, for example dark command, hot keyed next to AMS, it would be easy to press/click it on accident. I could easily have done what you did. &quot;What if the off tank taunts...&quot; Try harder with your arguements next time, kid.</div></div><hr />

2nd If u press the wrong heal the tank will just use a deffensive cooldown and u can make up for the error that u made (not that big of a deal)<br />
Which the tank will instinctively just do in the instant you make a mistake!<br />

3rd A dps like a dk might need to taunt something with deathgrip in the middle of the fight and instead he might taunt the boss gg wipe<br />
Wow, he has to do something *out of the ordinary* *once* where he has to *specifically* target something else and he dies if he *fails* to something as *simple* as switching targets? That's so hard! Healers have you ever felt this kind of pressure and advanced game play?!<br />

I think it will be really hard to find ppl that are willing and capable of healing 5 man hc's and raids. I know a lot of healers and at least half of them are gonna switch to dps because they can't grasp the concept of the new healing. Also, I know a lot of dps and tanks that will just stick with their role. I know I know it's not a scientific research, but still, you cannot deny what someone called the 'gut feeling' of the community. GC is just not really giving the answers we want to hear.<br />
<br />
And the most important thing Blizz needs to fix is ofcourse the : &quot;OMG hEaL me!!!&quot; &quot;Get out of the fire/cleave/tailsweep/darkstuff under your feet/etc.) then&quot; &quot;WTF I died YoU SucK HEALEer!!&quot; and then get votekicked by a 15 year old nab :-/</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
If he is dieing i dont see why he shouldnt use a deffensive cooldown, its not like he will be 1 shotted and needs 0.000001 reaction times to use a cd when his below 50% hp or smth.<br />
<br />

Like I said on my other post that isnt what a dps needs to worry about diffrent bosses diffrent mechanics. Furthermore you say that you might missclick a heal and (in your view) its a big deal and then say whats so hard about tab taunt? Please...<br />
<br />
<br />

Actually I have played all roles tanking,dps and healing at end game in WOTLK so dont talk about healing being hard when all you/we do atm is look at green bars and fire on the floor.<br />

You have never EVER raided a hard-mode before. There are some boss abilities which push the tank's health so much that if the healers make one mistake, the tank dies. It can happen in such a short time that the tank won't even get the opportunity to react with a defensive cooldown. In many of these cases, the tank may already be using that defensive cooldown.<br />
<br />
In these situations, if a damage dealer messes a bit up in their rotation it will only result in a loss of DPS. In a healer's case, it will lead to a wipe.<br />
<br />
Like I said on my other post that isnt what a dps needs to worry about diffrent bosses diffrent mechanics. Furthermore you say that you might missclick a heal and (in your view) its a big deal and then say whats so hard about tab taunt? Please...<br />
The point is that your mistake has to be literally retarded such as making the boss actually go out of its way to crush you to die as a DPS. And even if that's the case, it doesn't necessarily lead to a wipe and you may even survive if the tank is quick enough to register your incredibly stupid mistake. The only pressure you are *ever* going to get as DPS is in a DPS race which by the way is the easiest type of encounter (&quot;burn phase&quot;).<br />
