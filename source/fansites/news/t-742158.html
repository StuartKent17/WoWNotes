Rather than derail threads on individual classes or specializations, I thought I would address some common questions or misperceptions in this one thread.<br />
<br />
We don't consider &quot;bloat&quot; a bad word. Players typically say that when there are more talents than they can possibly get. That's the whole idea. When you run out of interesting talents, then that's when we think we have a problem.<br />
<br />
Related, if we do our jobs right, you are going to run out of dps talents (or healing talents if you're a healer, or mitigation talents if you're a tank). We don't want every talent to feel mandatory since you are prohibited from getting them all. We want you to have choices.<br />
<br />
We don't consider every talent that doesn't directly lead to higher dps to be a &quot;PvP talent.&quot; Survivability is a big deal in Cataclysm. In that vein, talents that keep you alive (or help healers conserve mana) are indirectly dps talents. :)<br />
<br />
Related, many trees lost a lot of true PvP talents, such as dispel resistance or mechanic duration reductions. These are the kind of talents I describe as &quot;arms races,&quot; where you need a counter to the ability someone else is using to try to counter you. We'd rather reel the whole thing in a little and make things like crowd control or dispels as powerful or as weak as they need to be baseline rather than assuming you have talents that make them less powerful.<br />
<br />
We are providing some damage talents for healers. For the most part, those are optional talents for leveling, soloing, PvP or times in dungeons or raids when you don't need to heal.<br />
<br />
Likewise, we don't assume tanks need to pick up every single dps talent in order to generate sufficient threat. You'll likely need some threat talents, but since you're probably dipping into a dps tree to get some of those, you're going to find way more than you can afford.<br />
<br />
In most cases, raid buff talents are cheap and often have selfish bonuses. If they lack a selfish bonus, it's because we consider the talent so compelling that you'd probably want it when solo anyway. We see a lot of &quot;I'll skip that talent, because someone else will bring that buff,&quot; but obviously that logic starts to fail when everyone comes to that conclusion. Also make sure you're familiar with how some of the buffs and debuffs have changed for Cataclysm. We are trying to make it even easier to get the big ones, especially for 10-player raids.<br />
<br />
We aren't designing PvP vs. PvE trees. Ultimately, we consider a talent specialization to be a stylistic choice. However, given the challenges of nailing both PvP and PvE balance, as a consolation prize it's nice when at least there are no dead trees. If Frost and Arms weren't raiding juggernauts, at least they did have a place in the game in Lich King. But Cataclysm represents an opportunity to try again, so we hope to see Arms and Frost raiding, and Fury and Fire in PvP.<br />
<br />
We aren't overhauling every single class. We are changing paladins quite a bit, and the resource systems for hunters and warlocks and Balance druids have changed. I get the sense some of you are waiting for that magical build in which half of your talents have been scrapped in favor of new ones, and in many cases, those changes just aren't coming. That's not to say we're done with any tree.<br />
<br />
We haven't been super concerned about numbers yet, and we aren't at all concerned about glyphs yet. It's helpful if you note abilities that seem to have lost a lot of damage compared to live, just so we can make sure it's intentional (as it is for many AE abilities). If you think you won't use some core spell just because it doesn't hit or heal for enough yet, then it's fine to bring that up, but you can also assume that the numbers just aren't quite right on it yet. Of course this also means that you may feel underpowered (or rarely overpowered, though players almost always feel underpowered) compared to someone else. This does not mean you're doomed in Cataclysm or that you need to SCREAM REAL LOUD to make sure the developers don't overlook it. Numbers are much easier to adjust once we're happy with the basic mechanics.<br />
<br />
We've gotten a ton of great feedback already, and I want to personally thank you for that. We make changes every day that are the direct result of the feedback we receive, and that certainly includes this forum, the live forums, and many of the great websites out there were players discuss World of Warcraft design. <br />
<br />
<br />
Quality of Beta Posts on Official Forums<br />
I hate to go all forum moderator on you guys, but we've seen a recent downward spiral in the quality of some of these threads and posts here on the beta forum.<br />
<br />
Story time: I started posting heavily in the Lich King beta forums. It was a great experience and lot of players enjoyed the opportunity to be able to have intelligent conversations directly with the developers. I've heard over and over ever since then what a positive experience that was for a lot of players. It's for that reason that I am going to be fiercely protective of the quality of posts here in the Class Discussion forum.<br />
<br />
If you see a locked thread, chances are we thought it crossed the line. If you keep making the kinds of threads that get locked, then you'll be removed from the beta and we will replace you with someone who can provide intelligent feedback. Sorry to sound like a jerk -- I hate making these kinds of posts. But we want participating in the beta to be a positive experience. <br />

Shield of Righteousness removed from Beta<br />
We have temporarily disabled Shield of Righteousness.<br />
<br />
We're working on the basic Prot rotations right now, and with Shield of Righteousness in addition to Crusader Strike, Hammer of the Righteous, Consecrate, Avenger's Shield and Holy Wrath, there was just a lot going on. Shield seemed like the least interesting of those abilities -- really Shield and Hammer just seem to be single-target and multitarget versions of the same ability, especially without block scaling. Shield also felt like a duplicate of Shield Slam, which doesn't help in trying to differentiate the two Prot trees. Frankly, we'd rather make Avenger's Shield and Hammer of the Righteous cooler than they are today.<br />
<br />
It's too early to call this a permanent change. We still have a lot to consider, such as the damage of Hammer vs. Shield, how different we want the AE vs. single-target Prot attacks to be, and how much Holy Power considerations occupy a Prot paladin.<br />
<br />
If we keep Shield of Righteousness, we need to figure out its role relative to Hammer. We don't want it to be just swap one button for another for AE fights, and we don't want you to have to use both on cooldown since we are giving Prot paladins more things to manage in Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262766511/paladin-shield-of-the-righteous/))<br />
<br />
Paladin Gameplay<br />
As far as the paladin changes go, we have made no secret that we haven't happy with the paladin gameplay on live, of all three trees, and the class was headed for a pretty radical redesign. There can be very few sacred cows as part of that process or we're not going to have the design space we need to fix the problems.<br />
<br />
The current Cataclysm rotation is far from static and was in fact so frenetic that we had to scale back on some of the random procs and Holy Power generation or paladins were never going to have the bandwidth to do things like position the boss. It was far away the most complex tank rotation, and that's not what we were going for.<br />
<br />
We're trying a lot of new ideas and it's going to take some iteration before we're happy with them. The current snapshot you are getting in beta is just a snapshot -- it's whatever the data happened to look like at the time when we made a build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26262766511/paladin-shield-of-the-righteous/))<br />
<br />
Righteous Fury / Threat<br />
We recently made a change, that I suspect you don't have yet, to make Righteous Fury improve all threat and not just Holy threat. It's also possible attacks like Judgement, Crusader Strike and Hammer of the Righteous just don't hit hard enough yet. You lost a lot of passive Strength and damage in the talent trees and we haven't baked all of that back in yet.

- Paladins high block chance compared to other tanks<br />

i really like how they lie about talents! &quot;Optional and Situational Talents&quot; Yeah right, you still have to put in 5 points into single tier to proceed to another. And there's still no &quot;fun talents&quot;. <br />

It slows the pulls if you are one of those silly people that actually wait for the mobs to come to you on every pull. This tank uses AS on the run and i do HotR instantly after that. Pull is slowed by half a sec max. Now, for the aforementioned tanks, the pull without daze will still last longer than it does for me with the daze. I mean it's a &quot;stupid pointless change&quot; that's fed to you with a dressing of &quot;stupid silly reason&quot; which you eat up without question and ask for seconds. Oh well, guess prot pvp is dead anyway with all the changes they plan on doing so i don't know why i'm complaining.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but it doesnt change the fact, that we still dont have a gap closer for PvE or PvP, compared to other tanks in combat charges (all warrior specs, and tank/DPS ferals) and death grips.<br />

This daze effect helped us against diengaging hunters, blinking mages, porting warlocks, running rogues and so on ... I hope you see the point now.</div></div><hr />

Then you heared something wrong, it's a 'goal' by blizzard to make tanking specs viable for PvP. But all these changes, Holy Power, etc. made us weak. We can be easily kited and cannot actually upload our damage.</div></div><hr />

Look like your right about that, I was thinking about the comment GC made about not wanting prot damage to be so aggresive in PVP. <br />
<br />
At any rate you make a good point about the Daze effect as it relates to PVP maybe they will give it back in glyph form later, suggesting that instead of being so upset over losing it in the first place would have probably been more productive.</div></div><hr />

indeed, it does feel weird. if I have shield in my left hand why shouldn't I be able to punch someone in face with it, I feel we would be better without Crusader strike. or something els. but if that makes our rotation too complex, then why not to make it without GCD so we could macro it with our other attacks, and still be able to punch people with it?</div></div><hr />

There were others ways to do this than RealID. I&quot;m sure there would be a few out there that would still love their name to be out there for their 15min of fame as the best troll in the world on Blizzard forums. As weird as that is.<br />

We don't consider &quot;bloat&quot; a bad word. Players typically say that when there are more talents than they can possibly get. That's the whole idea. When you run out of interesting talents, then that's when we think we have a problem.<br />
thats not what people are saying. What people say is that with the new talent trees we have less individuality than before, less creativity, less choices and less fun and we have less talent points than in vanilla wow. Do you understand ? <br />
<br />
The new talent trees are simplified to much to a point where everyone has the same talents. The new talent tress design offer far less choice and options then the live trees. When people get 10 points to put in other specs, while forced to spend 31 in their spec(class) of choice, thats a bad talent tree design.

This tank uses AS on the run and i do HotR instantly after that. Pull is slowed by half a sec max. Now, for the aforementioned tanks, the pull without daze will still last longer than it does for me with the daze. I mean it's a &quot;stupid pointless change&quot; that's fed to you with a dressing of &quot;stupid silly reason&quot; which you eat up without question and ask for seconds. Oh well, guess prot pvp is dead anyway with all the changes they plan on doing so i don't know why i'm complaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
The slow is not good if you are in a heroic you are appropriately geared for. If you tank the mobs where they stand, not to mention CC will be in affect, you will have to separate mobs pull them into cleared territory, cause a pat aggro could possibly mean you wipe. Also, you may need to puill mobs to you to separate them for cc so they don't get broken by splash damage, this is an old tactic used back in vanilla wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
#1. &quot;Survival&quot; talents. I personally enjoy them, but the current raiding climate assumes that players select the talents beneficial to THEIR role.<br />
&quot;So what if you've got a talent that lets you stand in fire a second longer, GTFO out of it in the first place, noob!&quot;<br />
&quot;DPS&quot; Talents that make the healer's job easier makes as little sense to me as &quot;Healer&quot; talents that increase the DPS of players they are healing.<br />
It will only work if Blizzard is deliberately attempting to change the Raiding culture of the game, and thats a big IF.<br />
<br />
#2. &quot;Bloat&quot; ~ less total talents or more, I dont like the feeling that I have to give up something huge in order to get the bare minimum that I want. If they make every talent in a tree equally desirable, that in effect means players will have to turn down desired talents to choose first or second tier from other trees. curbing creativity even more then reducing the # of talent points did.<br />
<br />
Not only do I not MIND having &quot;generally undesirable&quot; talents in my tree, I enjoy it. I enjoy finding those rare fights that being able to use an exotic spec is more efficient and &quot;fun&quot;. I loved using my &quot;pvp spec&quot; in Faction Champions in TOC, but I also enjoyed how much easier it made certain choices about which talents NOT to take for my general purpose spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless of what happens to the Paladin class in the future it was an extremely bad design decision to have something as powerful as AD be a passive. No class should have an ability that says &quot;every 2 minutes, you cannot be 1-shotted&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Invisible Elf</div><div class="date">2010-07-25, 11:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few words on talent tree design <br />
We don't consider &quot;bloat&quot; a bad word. Players typically say that when there are more talents than they can possibly get. That's the whole idea. When you run out of interesting talents, then that's when we think we have a problem.<br />
thats not what people are saying. What people say is that with the new talent trees we have less individuality than before, less creativity, less choices and less fun and we have less talent points than in vanilla wow. Do you understand ? <br />
<br />
The new talent trees are simplified to much to a point where everyone has the same talents. The new talent tress design offer far less choice and options then the live trees. When people get 10 points to put in other specs, while forced to spend 31 in their spec(class) of choice, thats a bad talent tree design. You may have removed bloat but you removed almost all personal choice by trimming them down so dramatically.<br />
<br />
I just tested making one of the more popular cookie cutter raid DPS spec for rogues (my class). It turns out that there was ONE point that I actually had the choice of placing on any talent I wished. ALL of the other talent points were spent on DPS-increasing talents.<br />
<br />
On the current cataclysm beta talents, if creating roughly the same spec, I could now use 8 (!) talent points on optional talents that did not increase DPS. I could use these to increase healing on me, or survivability, or on some talents that would be nice in PvP. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't really call this &quot;less choice&quot;. Of course other classes may have it differently but really, how often did you not go all the way down in a three? With the new talent threes you can now pick many of the talents you WANT while still being competitive in raids or PvP and not being called a &quot;n00b&quot; because you did not take all the DPS or healing increasing talents...</div></div><hr />

Pick the top 2 guilds from every server and give them beta invites. Since the servers range from mediocre to world class you'll have a good mix of players in there. Good and bad will be covered.<br />
<br />
And the top guilds will all provide much more valuable feedback than any random invitee, since they know their class better than 90% of the population out there and have an easier job adapting to new skills.<br />
<br />
Screw random invites. They worked for vanilla beta when the game was new. Now you want people that know the game.<br />
<br />
Most of the videos I've seen on youtube about the beta make me cringe. 90% of the players in the beta have not a single clue about what they're doing and how to play the class. Most of them use premades of classes they've never played. What's the point? Do that on the PTR where people more qualified to give feedback will take care of it. In the Beta you're expected to play classes you're familiar with.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Random invites are a mistake at this point and premades on the Beta servers are an even bigger mistake.</div></div><hr />

The slow was intended to give the group time to get CC in place before the mobs got so close that Concecrate would break the CC. They will either have to stop Concecrate from breakin CC or they will have to reimplement the daze effect. The change itself was made to make Prot\Ret less attractive since the control factor was one of the main reasons to do it. This goes for the attempt at less damage more threat.</div></div><hr />

It just seems like they have no clear focus as to what to do with any hybrid character.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think they've lost their mojo. They lost a lot of their developers to not only Starcraft II, but Diablo III, and the &quot;secret mmo that no one will play because they won't announce a title or genre&quot;. They have to be on their bottom tier of developers, at this point. That's the way this looks. And, to be honest, I expected them to lose a large quotient of their quality, because you can only stretch yourself thin for so long. You can't have all four games be absolutely amazing with competitive (read: up-to-date) graphics engines, amazing story, and scalable difficulty.<br />
<br />
At this rate, I don't think I will be getting the expansion. I'm not interested in seeing a lifeless project, especially after all the shenanigans that have been going on. They've had over 5 years to figure out a consistent vision for each and every class. I don't feel like paying for a 2nd rate game based on haphazard methodology.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess you got my point.<br />
<br />
On the other hand they want diversity of players in beta, generally speaking level of play.<br />
That does not happen so much with old-school players. Maybe they could provide better feedback but for example Blizz UI is pretty much nonexistant within that sort of players. Newcomers use that a lot.<br />
Guess you got my point.<br />
<br />
EDIT for clarifying :<br />
Generally speaking, good feedback is not based upon experience of player. Its about will and compasion, and presenting in decent manner.<br />
You dont have to be 5-year playing hardcore raiding guy to provide such feedback, but it helps a bit in way you know how things work.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fwc577</div><div class="date">2010-07-25, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Related, many trees lost a lot of true PvP talents, such as dispel resistance or mechanic duration reductions. These are the kind of talents I describe as &quot;arms races,&quot; where you need a counter to the ability someone else is using to try to counter you. We'd rather reel the whole thing in a little and make things like crowd control or dispels as powerful or as weak as they need to be baseline rather than assuming you have talents that make them less powerful.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see GC say this but I have yet to see them even begin to touch on Stuns, Snares, and CC yet.<br />
<br />
These points in the trees were to counter or reduce these mechanics because classes don't like become useless in PvP because they cannot move or lose control of their character.<br />
<br />
Something needs to be done about the Stuns, Snares, and CC or in Cataclysm you might as well roll classes who have the most control because everyone else is going to be made virtually useless in PvP.<br />
<br />
Shamans and Paladins losing dispel resistance is a huge disadvantage for these classes, they have no reliable escape or gap closers. What's going to stop a rogue from say Bleed kiting a paladin to death now? He will spend 90% of the fight snared unable to do anything because his Hand of Freedom is on cooldown. Shamans are in the same boat, they are looked at as free HKs now, in xpac they are going to end up free HKs with a little more health.<br />
<br />
They aren't the only classes, Warlocks are also going to suffer, right now the only way a Warlock can down any of my toons in PvP is if he is geared enough to be able to kill me during a death coil + Fear if my trinket is on cooldown. PvP as a Warlock in xpansion is going to be hell when they can do almost nothing and will spend the fight CC'd/Snared.<br />
<br />
Warriors are making it fine out of the arms race, as Arms will have Juggernaught, Fury will have Imp Intercept, and Prot will have Warbringer giving them the extra mobility they need to help and negate the snares in PvP.<br />
<br />
Hunters are another class that will suffer from these changes when their partners will have less of an ability to aid them at getting range.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP is going to be really messed up for a while unless they take a hard look at the abilities that caused this &quot;arms race&quot; as they put it, but they seem to lack the understanding that it is something tht will be needed.</div></div><hr />

I hate to repeat like a broken record, but &quot;It's Beta&quot;. They felt Pallies were too easy, so they added complexity. They now think they may have overdone the complexity and are simplifying a bit. That's the point of Beta, to play test until you have a balance you like. I almost wish they kept the NDA in place for the whole beta period, it's maddening to see every little tweak they do treated as if it's some major change to a religious text.

I mean, yes, play the game as you normally would to test out stuff, but shit-talking on the forums where game designers are trying to nail down every little bug possible helps nobody.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly, like http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=26262927507&amp;sid=2000 where dude is asking where are worgens and he wants to play.. like beta is meant to play for fun and not to test. while most of thers point out how beta is unpolished.. of guys talking how WoW beta is unpolished and so on. Hell bunch of those dudes should be kicked right away.</div></div><hr />

Amen to that.<br />

But what can you do. Quality control is often hard to find on a beta and doing something like this is something that hasn't been tried quite that much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then you have trees like the assassination tree where 2 of the 5 first talents you pick are 100% wasted if you're going into PvE.<br />

Black jack wich makes it so your sab targets do less damage wich is good is bad? That makes sab more useful so tanks take less damage if used properly. So because you dont know how to use it its dumb or its dumb because its not a dps increasing talent?people need to get out of the mind set that dps increasing talents are the only talents dps wants.Blizz is trying to get away from that by making it so dps will have to do more than just dps. Healers are gonna run out of mana and not heal as largelys meaning all kinds of cc will be needed to keep the group alive. No more dps only focus being 1st on dps charts if thats your train of thought you will fail the group in dungeons. Dps more will have more to do than mindlessly statnding there doing dps. Focus on helping your self survive, the group survival,and your dps meaning more work for dps wich is good.</div></div><hr />

Or it will turn out like any other PTR, Beta when top guilds spend hours on new raid bosses to try them, find out best way to lvl to get world first boss kills, and after bitch how easy content is. <br />
<br />
<br />
IMO invites should get new people, random mix from raiders But main prio for the most active and best feedbeck givers on forums. those who are giving best feedback's now on live should get prio to get in and test new expansion. atleast we would know they would do there job not only QQ.<br />
<br />
There are no raid bosses available in the beta. And never have the top guilds from servers QQ'd about how easy the content is because they knew they were testing mostly normal modes and not hardmodes. In fact if a boss was too easy, this was mentioned with additional info on why it is too easy and what can be changed to render the fight more challenging/interesting. The only time these guilds QQ is when a stupidly easy boss that was tested on the PTR makes it live in its PTR version.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that I said top guilds from &quot;every&quot; server. There are a lot of servers (most in fact) that do not have world top100 quality guilds on them as you seem to understand my statement. By taking the top guilds of ALL servers you get an excellent mix of player style and quality that are for the most part willing to give constructive feedback.<br />
<br />
And you have the added benefit of these players knowing what they're doing and knowing their class instead of just mashing buttons at random accomplishing nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pick the top 2 guilds from every server and give them beta invites. Since the servers range from mediocre to world class you'll have a good mix of players in there. Good and bad will be covered.<br />
<br />
And the top guilds will all provide much more valuable feedback than any random invitee, since they know their class better than 90% of the population out there and have an easier job adapting to new skills.<br />
How does hitting level 10 feel for an inexperienced player? What are the raids like for first timers? Are the dungeons challenging for non-raiders? How does rolling a new class you haven't played before feel? <br />
<br />
All important feedback, none of it covered by your idea of only inviting experienced players. You pick a few people you specifically want in the beta then you use random invites for the rest because it's the only way to actually test the whole game from as wide a number of perspectives as possible. I have a cousin who's been playing 2 years and doesn't have a level 80 character, I sure as Hell can't test the game he's playing because it's got bugger all to do with the game I'm playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no such thing as new players testing the leveling experience, since you need an active bnet account with a Wrath WoW account linked to it. So your first point is moot. So is your second come to think of it. Take the example of your cousin. He obviously doesn't want to raid. And first time raiders (should they even ever exist in the beta) will not be able to provide any valuable feedback. The beta is not a friendly place, as soon as a new raider is spotted he will be removed from the pug.<br />
<br />
Now &quot;are the dungeons challenging for non-raiders?&quot; What kind of question is that? Are you saying non-raiders are necessarily worse players? Because I personally know quite a few raiders that are terrible (they would be covered by my proposition btw mostly coming from the mediocre realms). So this question is invalid aswell. The question should only be &quot;are the dungeons challenging?&quot; Whether a raider or not a shit player will always find them challenging.<br />
<br />
And finally &quot;How does rolling a new class you haven't played before feel?&quot; Now please enlighten me as to why the playerbase I suggested could not answer that question.<br />
<br />
I just invalidated all your points. Care to make new ones?</div></div><hr />

why would a first time raider not be able to provide feed back. Is not a problem right now in live new raiders being booted from pugs. Shouldnt the content allow new players the ability to raid. The new system should reduce kicking new players who are learning the class from raids. The raid should allow everyone who wants to raid the oppurtunity to raid without the hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it's only me but I'm a firm believer that a PuG should not be able to accomplish any more than the first boss of an instance. If you want to raid join a guild, be social. You're supposed to interact with people in an MMO. Everything Blizzard is doing is taking away that interaction.<br />
<br />
And you don't learn how to play a class from raiding you learn how to perfect rotations and the use of cooldowns. If you don't know the basics of how to play your class before even attempting to raid you have no place in said raid.</div></div><hr />

Raiding is differnt then a 5 man dungeon. Raiding should be something a new player tries and wants more because its fun and challenging sending only people with raiding experience is only half the detail you need new raiders to try it and be like hey this cool and fun i want to do more and be inviting. Not hated on for being new that turns people off the raids and the game intirely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now &quot;are the dungeons challenging for non-raiders?&quot; What kind of question is that? Are you saying non-raiders are necessarily worse players?<br />
As a generalisation? Of course I am, only a blithering idiot would think otherwise. Back in Vanilla my guild didn't raid, doing the 45 minute baron run in blues was the pinnacle of my pre-TBC experience and for a dungeon runner that was pretty bloody good. Come TBC we started raiding Kara/ZA and suddenly the dungeons looked like a walk in the park.<br />
<br />
Because I personally know quite a few raiders that are terrible (they would be covered by my proposition btw mostly coming from the mediocre realms). <br />
Sure, there are terrible raiders and great dungeon runners, but as a generalisation the raiders are going to be better players simply because they have to be.<br />
<br />
So this question is invalid aswell. The question should only be &quot;are the dungeons challenging?&quot; Whether a raider or not a shit player will always find them challenging.<br />
If you draw a Venn diagram showing the intersection of the sets of upper 50% of players, lower 50% of players, dungeoneers, and raiders, the raiders will include more of the upper 50% and the dungeoneers the lower. I defy anyone to design a 5 man dungeon that the top two guilds on my server from either faction would find challenging that the average player was even capable of completing, the difference is that great.<br />
<br />
And finally &quot;How does rolling a new class you haven't played before feel?&quot; Now please enlighten me as to why the playerbase I suggested could not answer that question.<br />
I've got 6 80s at the moment, if I roll one of the ones I haven't got I'm already going to be familiar enough with the mechanics and how Blizzard fit things together that it'll just be &quot;blah blah blah, kill more stuff&quot;. A player with only 1 toon on live is going to have a very different experience to me, their experience matters just as much as mine.<br />
<br />
I just invalidated all your points. Care to make new ones?<br />
You invalidated precisely none of them, nor will you. Game betas use a hand picked few and a semi-random mass (semi random because you want a good mix of hardware, no point finding out at go-live that it doesn't work well on certain ATI GFX cards) because it's what's needed to test things properly. Blizzard didn't choose this model by accident, they chose it because it works better than anything else anyone's ever come up with.<br />

<br />
<br />
I just wanna correct you on this one, a majority of the time its not the hardcore raiders that are the elitests its infact the casuals who get some shiny purples and think they're gods. See the hardcore raiders barely raid/group outside of their guild and their &quot;elitism&quot; is contained between their friends/guildies. The &quot;elitists&quot; that people seem to have the issue with are the ones running or in pug raids, with their high gearscores and attitude since they have a gearscore higher then most they are better then everyone with less. These are the same people who feel that every loot they want from a pug should be defaulted to them since theyre so amazing &quot;carrying&quot; the rest of the raid with their amazing gear.<br />
<br />
When it comes to beta, people who get into the beta instantly feel theyre better then everyone else not in the beta because they get to do stuff others dont. I mean look at the alpha testers on the forums youll see they are usually talking down to all the &quot;new&quot; beta testers. Its just human nature to think youre better then someone else the minute you get or do something few have or earn, alot of people feel this way but just dont express these feelings to everyone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buzzinjoe</div><div class="date">2010-07-25, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Inexperienced is not the same as new.<br />
<br />
You were referring to the leveling experience up to 10. So yes they are exactly the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here you're arguing my point for me, you're saying that the current beta testers are too elitist to get the content tested by a variety of players and yet you want to invite MORE of those people.<br />
<br />
I said the current testers are elitist and don't give constructive feedback. What's the point of adding new players that won't be able to give feedback because these guys are still around? Instead get good players that will give feedback. And top tier players are wrongfully labeled elitist btw.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a generalisation? Of course I am, only a blithering idiot would think otherwise. Back in Vanilla my guild didn't raid, doing the 45 minute baron run in blues was the pinnacle of my pre-TBC experience and for a dungeon runner that was pretty bloody good. Come TBC we started raiding Kara/ZA and suddenly the dungeons looked like a walk in the park.<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is that you thought Kara was more difficult than SV or SH were at first? I'd like to remind you that those dungeons were absolutely fantastic and they were challenging for raiders aswell at first. The only thing that was challenging in Kara got nerfed may I remind you and that was Nightbane v1. When you raided ZA you were already outgearing heroics so that's a moot point again. I'm talking about entry challenge. WotLK was just faceroll easy even the first time around.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, there are terrible raiders and great dungeon runners, but as a generalisation the raiders are going to be better players simply because they have to be.<br />
<br />
And that's something they want to change by making dungeons more challenging again. So if a dungeon is slightly challenging for raiders it's a great success. Thus they can test it just as well as dungeon runners.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you draw a Venn diagram showing the intersection of the sets of upper 50% of players, lower 50% of players, dungeoneers, and raiders, the raiders will include more of the upper 50% and the dungeoneers the lower. I defy anyone to design a 5 man dungeon that the top two guilds on my server from either faction would find challenging that the average player was even capable of completing, the difference is that great.<br />
<br />
Again I'll point you to SH and SV in TBC. All major guilds found them challenging at first, not overly, but challenging non the less. And they were indeed great fun. PuGs also managed these dungeons, it just took them a bit longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've got 6 80s at the moment, if I roll one of the ones I haven't got I'm already going to be familiar enough with the mechanics and how Blizzard fit things together that it'll just be &quot;blah blah blah, kill more stuff&quot;. A player with only 1 toon on live is going to have a very different experience to me, their experience matters just as much as mine.<br />
<br />
So because you have 6 80s you're assuming every raider in the top guilds has 5 or more alts?<br />
<br />
<br />
You invalidated precisely none of them, nor will you. Game betas use a hand picked few and a semi-random mass (semi random because you want a good mix of hardware, no point finding out at go-live that it doesn't work well on certain ATI GFX cards) because it's what's needed to test things properly. Blizzard didn't choose this model by accident, they chose it because it works better than anything else anyone's ever come up with.<br />
<br />
As I recall in TBC a vast majority of top guilds were given multiple beta keys for WotLK. And guess what the feedback they got from that beta was the best they'd ever gotten. They said so themselves.<br />
<br />
<br />
So basically you're saying that you believe the core of Blizzard's game design methodology is wrong so any feedback you gave on, for example, difficulty levels would be useless because your goal is not the same as Blizzard's goal. And you believe you're competent to design beta test selection criteria?<br />
<br />
Yes I'm saying that the WotLK design goal was a wrong one. And again Blizzard admitted it by now trying to make dungeons more challenging and disallowing current top tier raiders to jump straight into a raid and succeed on Cata launch as they were able to with WotLK. Here again I can make the point that these top tier raiders are in fact the best suited beta testers since they're the ones that will be able to raid with the minimum gear required letting Blizzard know whether their scaling is working or not.<br />
<br />
So what else have you got to say?</div></div><hr />

I think most people are thinking ahead for when we're at level cap and done with badges. they're not going to make bosses silenceable. and there are enough interrupts in the raid to handle any amount of casts. sure, silences and stuns will be great for 5 mans. but they'll lose their luster when we're raiding and those abilities don't have a use outside of adds.<br />

<br />
true there boring in some regards but there more intresting then xskill by x% damage or x% crit increase those have even less to do change how you might use your character and are even more boring. More fights with movement means you need to be able to move faster or find a way to take less damage or threat if avaible at all through skills not talents. They might make raid bosses with certain things being interubtable obviously if they where to do that it would be very situational times for it. But definently more common on 5 man dungeon bosses. Not to mention tanks are having a hard time holding more 3 mobs of agro they dont seem to know how many mobs the want tanks to hold just yet. The days of good raid builds being take all the obvious dps increasing talents is going byby and i say good riddance having the ability to choose talents that actually offer different play style based on how you want to live and benificail to you after getting the dps talents that are obvious is good. After all taking taking talents that alter survival mechanics and stragey is more interesting than heres x% to hit crit damage wich is mundane and far more boring. So uniqueness will be based on how you survive and keep contributing to the raid and not be mana drain for the healer and how you can help the tank or any of the other combination not mention dead because dead is worthless. Its hard to say how raids will work with those talents they might make there more usable in raids lots of movement and massive aoe interms of aoe size complicats whats safe and whats not. max dps or healing is harder when moving on some classes than others so untill more raid info comes out its still in the air afterall it is beta</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Avenger's Shield no langer dazes: we never really had a interrupt to go with, and now they are taking away this.<br />
- Paladins high block chance compared to other tanks<br />
- AD no passive: now a clone of Last Stand<br />
- Removing ShotR: it always was a clone of Shield Slam, what the fuck? Add a interrupt in it and it'll be &quot;unique&quot; again.<br />
- etc. etc.<br />
<br />
I dont like the direction paladin goes to, and some of you idiots can flame me now - you probably dont have the slighest clue about your own class, but whatever.<br />
<br />
AS is still going to silence mob with the correct talent point, learn what daze is.<br />
Paladins having a higher block chance was an unfair advantage.<br />
AD being passive is arguably an unfair advantage.<br />
Removal of SoR is not permanent as of yet. They're simply testing it - WHICH IS WHAT A BETA IS.<br />
<br />
You suggest that we don't know our own class and yet you have misinformation all over your post, and all you're really doing is QQing that Paladins are going to take skill to play now.<br />
<br />
And before the flames, my main is a protadin. Arasi on Icecrown.</div></div><hr />

That the Paladin as a melee class (both as prot and ret) are screwed. As in useless in pvp, go spec holy.<br />

<br />
QFT. The vast majority of people with arrogant, &quot;elitist&quot; attitudes are gearscore whores in mediocre-to-bad guilds who think they're awesome because they have a 6k GS and/or got carried through a normal mode LK kill with a 30% buff. Raiders in actual hardcore guilds tend to be pretty laid-back in PUGs; they know they have nothing to prove. They also tend to give the most helpful beta feedback and have the closest relationships to Blizzard developers.<br />
<br />
&quot;Elitism&quot; was never an issue in WoW until WotLK opened the floodgates to people who wouldn't even have been able to get in a raiding guild in vanilla/TBC. This is not a coincidence. (Note I am not saying it was a bad decision on Blizzard's part -- there were positive and negative outcomes, I'm just pointing out one of the negatives.)<br />

Ardent Defender is currently the most absurdly broken tanking talent in the game and everyone knows it. My pally is main spec prot, and even I want to see the damn thing nerfed. Turning it into an active CD is a reasonable way to balance it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of us DO live in a monarchy<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope that Blizzard will understand one day bubble ISNT SACRED COW, remove from ret palas and then try to balance class.<br />
<br />
I want to keep my bubble :( <br />
<br />
If they ever take my bubble i demand a huge nerf of iceblock (cut the duration in half and double the cd)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaylock</div><div class="date">2010-07-26, 07:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It slows the pulls if you are one of those silly people that actually wait for the mobs to come to you on every pull. This tank uses AS on the run and i do HotR instantly after that. Pull is slowed by half a sec max. Now, for the aforementioned tanks, the pull without daze will still last longer than it does for me with the daze. I mean it's a &quot;stupid pointless change&quot; that's fed to you with a dressing of &quot;stupid silly reason&quot; which you eat up without question and ask for seconds. Oh well, guess prot pvp is dead anyway with all the changes they plan on doing so i don't know why i'm complaining.<br />
<br />
Did you ever think that maybe prot paladins liked the daze because it gives other classes a bit of time to get CC on the mobs? Of course CC is non-existent in this retarded expansion so i guess it doesnt matter now. I like it for some of the Blood Prince and blood queen trash to give priests a padding to shackle the tactitions. And since they said CC will be making a return in this expansion, wouldnt the daze be a welcome addition? Just my thoughts.<br />
<br />
Yes, this WotLK expansion has been complete and utter crap. End rant.</div></div><hr />

You repent the mage, get close to him, tickle him once and hes already far far away from you. Now all you need to do is wait 1 more min so you can tickle him again while eating frostbolts, frostfire bolts and ice lances in the meantime. If that's not fun, i don't know what is!</div></div><hr />
