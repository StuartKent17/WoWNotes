The guy had 300k viewers when he did it, could probably become a popular streamer. E-famous for whatever that's worth<br />

Wowhead is doing the same thing right now, but there's nothing to discuss on retail right now really<br />
<br />
The WoW subreddit has also chosen to allow classic and retail discussion<br />

he utilized tech that didn't exist in vanilla. he was layer hopping which increased his xp/hr by about 650% based on the spawn time of those mobs vs his kill rate (because they were up in other layers so no downtime)</div></div><hr />

He didn't discover he could do it like that until he was already 54 and leading the race. Method was using a method of being in a raid with 6-7 people to abuse the system and by logging out they could reset the instance and spawn in at the start without running back to reset.

Which is pretty ironic when you consider how many people post about how the people on Classic will be older and more mature, when in reality a large portion of the people are just manbabies that never grew up. Even the entire WoW Classic streamers are all childish and immature, and their viewership and communities are terrible, to the point they don't even exist - they're just a meme.</div></div><hr />

For real. I was leveling on Classic and any time I asked for help I got insulted for being a &quot;filthy casual&quot; and to go back to retail where things are easier. And I wasn't the only person they did it to. Like....shit. It's so bad.</div></div><hr />

He knew he could use it but didn't want to. He felt it was unethical, but he eventualy used the layers at 58 to speed it up, when no one was even close. He would win without it.<br />

It's 3 days for the top 0.1% players who go for the fastest 60. The majority of players will never be even close to 3 days /played at 60.<br />

Let's not forget the whole concept of official Classic servers were spearheaded by people with the &quot;us versus them&quot; mentality (i.e. &quot;Make Azeroth Great Again&quot;). It's really no wonder why things got so toxic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, everyone knew it would be days for the super hardcore people pushing for &quot;world first&quot;. It's still months for people who only play couple hours a day. It will still take way over 100 hours in game to reach 60 if you're not abusing dungeon spam or aoe grinding. Closer to 200 hours for slower leveling classes.<br />
<br />
Sure, I believe you did it in 3 weeks. It's no achievement even. It just means you played probably 7-10 hours a day for those 3 weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't even true, he was at 60k/hr before he was hopping and went up to 90k/hr once he started hopping. While it's a big increase, he'd still get world first 60 regardless.<br />

He's done the exact same thing on private servers b4.</div></div><hr />

I'm not the only one who has had this same experience because I've seen other people talk about similar experiences across the forums. But sure. I'm trolling just because you don't want to believe it and think that everything about Classic is perfect.</div></div><hr />

Classic is a rerelease and all has been done before in the game. So just sit back and relax because your achievements have no merit at all. The only ones deserving any credit are the true first ones to have done it without any prior knowledge.<br />
<br />
Maybe one should just enjoy classic for what it is....old shit that is meant to trigger some nostalgic feelings<br />
<br />
Ever heard of speedrunning? These guys play the game over and over again to push their abilities to the limit. In WoW, you need a fresh realm for it to be legit run...so classic release has been the biggest speedrunning race in gaming history. I don't know why you would downplay that.<br />

In my personal experiences, it was far more than just a couple of players. I can ignore a couple of assholes. But anyone that was not in my guild was nasty to everyone in general chat and incredibly unhelpful. I can't count how many times people were ridiculed for asking for help in general chat. I asked about the best way to go about doing a quest and people told me to fuck off back to retail like the filthy casual I am.</div></div><hr />

You're thinking about it as someone no lifeing their way to end game in order to begin the end game grind when you should be thinking about level 60 itself is the end. Speed running is a pretty big sub-culture in gaming so it's not like this is some kind of new phenomenon. <br />

Working hard? He's about the 50,000,000 toon to make it to 60 under the old exp system, and like the 15,000,000 toon under an extremely late Vanilla patch, using addons and working off people who already did the work that he used to do what he did. It's disgusting his attitude as if he's something special. Remove all the addons, don't use guides and pre-written route system, and pre-selected quest and I think we will see his speed drop drastically just with that alone. He's standing on the shoulders of the people before him acting like he's something special. What was his /played time anyway?</div></div><hr />

What? Speedrunning gives games new purpose after they have been played out by players. Just because you don't find that purpose interesting, it's dumb?<br />

<br />
You do it then.<br />
It's not just about knowing what to farm and where. He himself contributes to optimizing the route. For example, he leveled cooking at level 10 so he can do some quests later in the game. Speedrunners often work together to push the record further and a lot of thought goes into it. Especially in very long speedrun like 1-60 in WoW, where you have to think ahead and prepare your body for long playing sessions.<br />
<br />
He still beat a lot of players that had real chance to claim world first. And how is he acting like something special? He thanked a lot of people in the end. You are also the one who didnt realize he was playing youtube video?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valkaneer</div><div class="date">2019-08-31, 01:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He didn't discover he could do it like that until he was already 54 and leading the race. Method was using a method of being in a raid with 6-7 people to abuse the system and by logging out they could reset the instance and spawn in at the start without running back to reset. Don't try and devalue his achievement.<br />
<br />
His level of hubris, haughty attitude, and a foul mouth made him look like a d-bag. If he had been extremely humble, thanked those that watched, gave respect to those who made is run to 60 happen and acknowledged that he utilized things that people in Vanilla never had, it would have changed the way people viewed what he did.<br />

Yes, he has no brother. Said it himself on Esfands stream. He also said he slept 9.5 hours in total. Yes, it seems crazy, but not impossible and his competitors at Method event acknowledged that he didnt account share. He is known in the classic community for speedrunning on private servers.</div></div><hr />

Method accused him of account sharing (really was just a caster who fell for meme from a twitch clip), then they apologized after looking more into it.<br />
<br />
And Kenny, who was serious contender for world first and was in Method's studio knows him, acknowledged it too.<br />
<br />
When people say Method in this world first race context, it's really confusing, because a lot of people who appear on their stream and say stuff, are not really affiliated with Method, but were just invited to the event.</div></div><hr />

I haven’t seen the video, but from what everyone is stating Joker is not the person making this comments but it’s a previous YouTube vid he is playing.<br />

Now, personally, I still take it as him saying it because he chose to play this video as something he did and to evoke a feeling, and I haven’t heard anything to point out that he did it sarcastically or ironically.<br />
<br />
It's a speedrunner meme video. His entire stream was full of memes.</div></div><hr />

I hope they release a really technical video about the difficulty behind all the programming to bring Classic in 2019. I know there's a blogpost about it but I want more!</div></div><hr />

Same in my experience. Met 2 nice people so far and instantly added them to my friends list. Even a lot of people in my guild at the moment are very toxic and overall just &quot;us vs them&quot; mentality. Constantly shitting on retail every time I log in.<br />
As someone that played both games I really don't understand this shit.<br />
<br />
I have limited time to play so I try to play both to a degree but the toxic community in classic at the moment is really bugging me.<br />
I'm level 24 now though so getting there slowly but surely !</div></div><hr />
