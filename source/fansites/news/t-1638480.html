Upcoming Dungeon Changes and Hotfixes<br />
We’ve been going through a lot of player feedback and concerns regarding changes to Dungeons and the Dungeon queuing system. In response to this feedback, we’re making a number of changes and wanted to give everyone a heads up on the changes that we’re working on to address these concerns.<br />
<br />
Reverting Default Loot Method to Need/Greed: <br />
Going into Warlords, we wanted to try to improve the dungeon loot experience by using Raid Finder’s personal loot system that had been successful in Mists. While the personal loot system was successful in eliminating drops that weren’t usable by anyone in the group, and reducing loot contention in some cases, we’ve also heard a significant amount of player feedback about how the system feels unrewarding and unsatisfying.<br />
<br />
In response to these concerns, we are reverting the default loot method in Dungeon Finder back to Need Before Greed. As always, players who queue with a full premade group may change group loot settings, and may use Personal loot or any other method if they so prefer. We will be evaluating how to better present and structure dungeon personal loot, and hope to re-introduce the system in the future.<br />
<br />
We’re adding an award of 50 Garrison Resources for completing the first Random Warlords of Draenor Heroic Dungeon of the day.<br />
This change is self-explanatory. Yay for more resources!<br />
<br />
Adding Call to Arms for In-Demand Dungeon Roles:<br />
The Call to Arms system for roles that are in-demand was not functioning properly for the max-level Warlords dungeon queue and we have a hotfix in the works to address this. In addition, the Satchel of Savage Mysteries will be updated to always contain an Augment Rune, which is a tradeable item that provides a consumable buff that is ordinarily only available through Raid Finder.<br />
<br />
Hotfix for being unable to queue from Ashran Cities:<br />
We recently implemented a hotfix that prevents players from queuing for dungeons or Raid Finder while actively engaged in PvP; to prevent players from circumventing item level requirements by using scaling PvP gear. However, this logic was mistakenly counting Stormshield and Warspear as active PvP areas and preventing queuing from there. That is being corrected (the hotfix will require realm restarts).<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that these hotfixes and changes are still being tested, and are not live yet. As always, your continued feedback is welcomed and please let us know how these changes play out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords Season 1 Conquest Gear Fixes<br />
As many of you reported, at the launch of Warlords of Draenor, there were a few issues that allowed players access to Conquest gear prematurely. Conquest Points (and in some cases, actual pieces of Conquest gear) were being rewarded from various locations, including Ashran, despite there being no active PvP season.<br />
<br />
We’ve now corrected those issues, and no more Conquest points are being earned or Conquest gear being awarded. However, to preserve the integrity of the upcoming PvP season, we need to do something about the Conquest points and gear that some players were already able to acquire. <br />
<br />
So, before Warlords Season 1 begins on December 2nd, we’ll be converting any remaining Conquest points into Honor, similar to the end-of-season conversions we’ve done in the past. Any excess Honor over the 4000-point cap will be converted into gold at 35 silver per Honor. Any existing Primal Gladiator’s (Conquest) gear will be converted into its corresponding Primal Combatant’s (Honor) counterpart.<br />
<br />
We apologize for the confusion that these issues have caused, but are looking forward to a clean start to the PvP season on December 2nd.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 1 Blueprint Book Hotfix<br />
Just in case though, we've implemented a hotfix to add a Book of Garrison Blueprints (http://www.wowdb.com/items/118215-book-of-garrison-blueprints) to the Garrison Blueprint Vendor for characters with a Level 2 Garrison. Characters that for whatever reason did not automatically learn the Level 1 blueprints during the upgrade into a Level 2 Garrison will be able to purchase this book to learn all the building blueprints they're supposed to have access too.<br />
<br />
However, there's a known issue where the book isn't being consumed when learned and the item cannot be sold or destroyed at this time. We're working on another hotfix to correct this issue but wanted to get this hotfix out so affected characters can progress.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Battle in Ashran Daily Quest<br />
We're investigating some issues with this daily quest and agree that it's not as clear as it should be.<br />
<br />
For everyone's benefit: currently, you need to collect 100 Artifact Fragments and turn them in at your Garrison. As Jinx mentions, turning them in to the NPCs in Ashran itself will remove them from your character and not count for the Apexis daily.<br />
<br />
We're also experiencing an issue for some players where the quest tracker will say &quot;0/1 Artifact Fragments&quot; and never update. If you experience this issue, you are still able to complete the quest by collecting 100 Artifact Fragments and turning them in at your Garrison. The quest tracker just won't tell you that you've completed the quest.<br />
<br />
We're working on correcting these issues, but in the meantime, following those instructions should allow you to complete the quest. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/350979-battle-in-ashran-daily-needs-re-worked/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15269819699?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Mob Corpses Despawning Quickly<br />
Intentional or a bug?<br />
The change to have corpses despawn more quickly was intentional and was made to improve performance in heavily populated areas (where a large number of things are being killed). We're planning to increase the duration again after things calm down. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/351027-mob-corpses-despawning-too-fast/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15270579249?page=3#52))<br />
<br />
Postmaster Hotfix<br />
We had a discussion with the Postmaster a bit over a week ago regarding their mailing habits. Seeing that they haven't changed their ways, we're going to have another talk with them. In the meanwhile, I can visualize the Postmaster picking through a deserted dungeon like some sort of reverse Treasure Goblin and mailing things back to you.

Raid Lockout Systems Recap<br />
Apparently there is still some confusion as to how raid lockouts work, so Blizzard posted a handy summary.<br />
Lockouts at a Glance<br />
Raid lockouts limit the number of times a character can kill a boss in a week for a chance at obtaining loot from that boss. Throughout the years, different raid lockout systems have been used, and multiple systems exist in the game depending on the system used at the time a raid was introduced.<br />
<br />
To check your current raid lockouts press your ‘O’ key in-game, select the Raid tab, and click on Raid Info in the upper right. This will display your current lockouts, and time left until they reset.<br />
<br />
There are three types of raid lockouts used in the game.<br />
<br />
Loot-based Lockout<br />
Used for: All Raid Finder raids, Siege of Orgrimmar Normal/Heroic, Warlords raids Normal/Heroic.<br />
<br />
You can kill a boss as many times per week as you like, but only loot it once per difficulty. Anyone can join anyone’s instance. Bosses are never locked to you, and you can always go back and kill them later even if you’ve skipped them by joining a group that had progressed further. Raid sizes can be anywhere from 10 to 30 players, and difficulty automatically scales to match.<br />
<br />
Flexible Boss-based Lockout<br />
Used for: Normal difficulty raids from Wrath of the Lich King through Throne of Thunder.<br />
<br />
You can only kill a boss once per week, and you may not enter an instance where a boss is alive that you have already defeated that week. You can move from group to group during a week as long as you’re joining instances that don’t have bosses alive you’ve already killed. If you enter an instance that is more progressed than your own and get saved to it, you will be locked to all prior bosses. You can move between 10 and 25 raid size, given these constraints.<br />
<br />
Strict Instance-based Lockout <br />
Used for: All classic raids (Molten Core through Sunwell), Heroic difficulty of Wrath of the Lich King raids through Throne of Thunder, and all Mythic difficulty raids.<br />
<br />
Progress is tied to a fixed instance ID. Once tied to an instance ID, you may not enter any other versions of that raid of that difficulty until your raid lock resets. If other players complete that instance while you are absent, the instance will be empty for you as well, because progress is tied to the instance, and not your character. You may not switch between 10-player and 25-player raid size once locked to one size or the other (does not apply to Mythic which is 20-player only).<br />

Warlords of Draenor Marketing<br />
Blizzard stepped up their marketing this time around, with Gorehowl in Times Square (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4500-Gathering-Professions-and-Buildings-Launch-Time-Q-A-Wednesday-Solo-Garrosh-Kill) and China (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/534822959446122496), Gazlowe's Reality (http://www.gazlowerealty.com/) ads actually appearing in newspapers (http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2ms7jh/normally_this_ad_space_is_used_for_real_estate/), and a new blog on Tumblr (http://justwarlordthings.tumblr.com/). You can even call 1-844-GAZLOWE to inquire about Draenor real estate!<br />

Personal loot sucks and it sucked in mop also. It gives you the exact same item multiple times and guess what, you CAN'T trade items in personal loot system.<br />
Seen a caster dps trinket drop in Everbloom hc for 3 times now and healer got it each time....yet the system doesn't give a crap that I need it and that the healer already has 2 in his bags.<br />
How can THAT be better then need/greed? It MIGHT be better for &quot;casual&quot; players but it sucks for guild pre-made groups that are getting ready for mythic raiding....make gearing insanely hard.</div></div><hr />

Then use need before greed for your premade groups maybe? This is about the default loot system for LFG groups.</div></div><hr />

If you're in a premade group you've been able to change the looting back to Need before Greed or whatever pleases you, if you've managed to miss that you can't have done many dungeons so far :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will take you a lot more time to get your trinket with old system. There is so many different loots what can drop and when the trinket finally drops. There will be healer needing on it, maybe other spell caster needing on it and maybe even that little feral who wants to try boomkin/resto someday. Oh and you lose the roll. after that you need to farm more and wait multiple runs so trinket finally drops again. And what happens next? You still dont get the trinket.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It should have been reversed from how they went. Pre-made groups should be able to set to need/greed, but random queued should be personal loot. I have no investment in 4 strangers getting an upgrade, nor do they have any in me.<br />

Stupid decision.</div></div><hr />

People cry and say personal loot is bad, they seem to forget how much they complained back when it still was need before greed.<br />
I myself prefer personal loot over need before greed.<br />
<br />
With the new gear changes you will have to compete with more people then you used to. <br />
When Plate gear drops i wont have strength or intel it will have both.<br />
<br />
So every plate wearer competes with eachother, no matter if its tank, dps or healer.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
Personal loot means i might get loot or i might not get loot.<br />
<br />
Need before greed means, loot i want might drop or it might not. But if it does i still need to win the roll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have done like 5-6 instance with no loot at all and personal loot is cool but need before greed is better as long as it has the same rules clothies can't roll on anything but cloth, leather for leather, mail for mail, plate for plate, same goes for trinkets and weapons if it has their primary stats for their class ie int for caster, agi for melee that use it, str for str class, spirit for healers.</div></div><hr />

This. Absolutely LOVE Personal Loot. Either I get loot or I don't. I never need to hate the guy in my party who's offspec could use the loot I just got and now I lost it because he rolled need even though it was offspec. <br />
<br />
Love, love, love personal loot. <br />

It's totally disappointing not getting lot very often but I sure wish they hadn't made this change. :(<br />

I think the argument is that you ALWAYS *saw* loot drop from each boss, it just wasn't something you could use or else someone else rolled and won it over you, but it was at least there. With personal loot (which I prefer) you either see your loot or you see nothing so it starts to seem like no loot is dropping at all.</div></div><hr />

I mean really. Personal loot was a huge step forward. No more ninjas needing on an item on the last boss, saying &quot;LOL&quot; in chat and vanishing, no more drama, potentially more loot for everybody since I've seen all 5 people getting loot from the same boss.<br />
<br />
Plus how the old loot system will work with the new stats on items? Heal and DD or Tank and DD especially loot is now shared between multiple roles since the same stats are viable for tanks and melee DPS for example. I've seen just a few items with &quot;bonus armor&quot;. How will blizz is planning to solve this? Or will healers and tanks will now have compete for loot with damage dealers? Because I can't see how is it possible to distinguish items with the new stat system without remaking all of those items from scratch.</div></div><hr />

Terrible terrible decision. Personal loot is fine the way it is.<br />
<br />
With the exception of getting wrong items like agility gear for dks or bonus armor for priests.<br />
<br />
Personal loot is a huge improvement for random groups where people need on everything they can possibly need on for vendorspec<br />

Can't they just make separate queues for group loot and personal loot? It would solve all the problems...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Group loot shouldnt have been introduced back until Blizzard implemented griefing reduction solutions that was talked about prior to the introduction of personal loot in MoP. This will likely result in a case of building a dam and then removing it without flow control methods in place.</div></div><hr />

Only thing more stupid than the change to group loot is the people on battle.net defending the change because &quot;you can still use personal loot in premades&quot;<br />
Group loot in random groups doesn't work, they finally found the solution, then after a week they scrapped the solution.<br />

I think in a five man environment with personal loot the system needs a change in how it works. Personal loot in five mans should not work just like the raids. Group loot also needs an overhaul which it sorely needed but was neglected all of MoP because five mans and the problem was considered a trivial mater.</div></div><hr />

For people playing fair, personal loot has been just as rewarding (except when its more rewarding from not having an item ninjaed). If you want items that aren't on your personal loot tables, then run an organized group with folks that will let you get your item. Instead of doing ass-backwards looting, they should have done something to make personal loot less silent. Like show when someone gets loot. Or instead of gold, if you've got a disenchanter in the group, give you a chance at a shard. Or some sort of counter to show what the luck has been for you and the people you've run with. Like a running tally of groups' loot per boss.</div></div><hr />

People really need to understand what Ninjaing is. It is not possible to ninja with the need-before-greed system. The loot that drops isn't yours until you win it, even if you believe it's best for you in comparison to everyone else.<br />
<br />
And you need to understand there is idiots who is in there as dps or tank and needs the healing trinket cause reasons, and with this change everyone will need on stuff cause they can turn it into dust.<br />
<br />
Well seems I need to find more friends to do dungeons with cause I aint doing this shit in a random anymore.</div></div><hr />

When I spend time an effort to kill a boss I expect loot to drop, regardless if I can use it or not. Personal loot is extremely boring and unsatisfying. The fact that they even tried to introduce it has obviously caused a stain on the game because now everyone will expect it to be the &quot;norm.&quot;<br />
<br />
This, right here. I resent being called a &quot;whiner&quot; and &quot;stupid,&quot; amongst other things, because I have a differing opinion about how a certain aspect of game design feels to me.</div></div><hr />

Problem was this night i was in LFG heroic and i could not change it too personal loot .<br />
I think they were seeing people getting geared a bit too fast and wanted too put a brake on it .<br />
Lesser drops means slower gearing meaning stretching content . The lazy bunch strikes again !!!</div></div><hr />

It can be quite the opposite you can do a full dungeon run and get anything.. I have been in runs where I have seen someone get something that I could use but I don't get because the personal loot RNG was not in my favour.. Example did a full run in Upper Blackrock Spire and got nothing but gold while others in the group got stuff that was useful to me..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Except now with the way loot has stats on it, you might have a guardian tank, mistweaver monk, combat rogue and balance druid all needing on the one piece of loot that drops, so it won't be a case of int for caster, agi for melee etc.<br />
<br />
Personal loot removed a lot of the jerkiness that comes along with random pugs. Why have it as an option in pre-made groups where presumably people have a higher chance of being more considerate with their friends/guildmates but remove it for a situation where 5 random strangers who don't give a hoot about the person next to them are brought together.</div></div><hr />

Well, it could be both. Personal loot, when no one got anything for the entire instance, was pretty terrible. At least now we know how much loot each boss is supposed to drop, and if there's no one who needs it, it gets disenchanted.<br />

I'm of the opinion that personal loot is terrible and should never be used outside of LFR, but I know I'm in the minority.</div></div><hr />

Problem is, as someone already mentioned, everyone is needing on everything to make up for the ilvl requirement to get into heroics. <br />
<br />
This is happening because their new stat system basically mixes stats from other classes and specs(albeit greying them out). So now you'll have to compete with more people for your gear as the need button won't be greyed out for them like it was in previous expansions.<br />
<br />
I can already see the fights breaking out in dungeons over loot. If the shitty launch wasn't enough, Blizzard had to go and make it worse.</div></div><hr />

I'm with you on this while PL is good I have done whole dungeons and gotten nothing.. Or I have done a dungeon and gotten something that either A: I already have or B: Is not an upgrade to what I already have and is thus useless..<br />
<br />
In fact talking to people and a few from my guild are happy to see the need greed system put to default..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rezzyk</div><div class="date">2014-11-21, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let's take the first boss in UBRS. He has a 2h mace, along with 40 other items (40-42 total, I lost count) on his loot table. With personal loot the game would only roll on a fraction of that since you can only wear a fraction. Now with Need Before Greed I have a 1 in 40 chance of the mace even dropping, and then have to roll on it against others? Whoever thinks that is better than Personal is insane.<br />
<br />
If Blizz wants to switch back to Need Before Greed they need to do it at the same time they massively cull the boss loot tables back to 5 or 6 items each. The Warlords 5man loot tables were designed with Personal Loot in mind, not Need Before Greed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only reason dungeons felt unrewarding without drops is that nothing like Justice/Valor exists where you can slowly work towards items if RNG decides to fuck you again.<br />
Would they give out apexis for completed dungeons similar to Justice, people would never have complained this much.</div></div><hr />

how is personal loot rewarding when you are basicly forced to run a Dungeon 100000 times just to get one piece of gear ? its just a huge Waste of time and it definitely does not feel rewarding. it just a huge time sink , and i am glad blizzard is removing personal loot from LFD.</div></div><hr />

We'll talk in 100 runs after the piece you need drops 3 times and you lose the roll to ninjas :) Trinkets always had a very low drop chance :) and now you'll be even less likely to get it because more possibility for some1 to ninja it or just legit roll for it and win it.</div></div><hr />

While with the current Need before Greed system, we have Guns and Bows drop in a non-hunter group? Where's the rewarded feeling in that? Where's the rewarded feeling in grouping up with a friend, both of you are casters, and finally the trinket you both want drops? Or where is the rewarded feeling in having our tank get his two WF items stolen on the last boss, by a DPS? If people can press need, they will need. It does not matter for them if it is actually usefull or not. These dungeons are meant to gear up for raiding. With personal loot, spamming a few dungeons felt really rewarding as you could get quite a few upgrades. Now with the new hotfixed default Need before Greed system, one can spam dungeons all day and not get anything because of the fact that they keep on being in new groups that need the same items as they do and lose the rolls. Personal loot finally made people unable to unrightfully claim others' loot. People were really happy about this, and there as an increase of 10Mil subs in 1 week. Not that it's for that reason alone, but gearing up didn't feel like a hassle anymore so it still was fun to play alts and gear them as well. With Need before Greed back, I actually think the Sub-train might go downhill again. So I do really hope that the default system becomes Personal Loot again.</div></div><hr />

Go with your guilds or friends for loot management. Random dungeons/raids should have random loot rewards.</div></div><hr />

Night before last I did two runs and got three drops with personal loot. A couple bosses dropped 3~4 pieces on a single kill, most averaged at least 2.<br />

Last night I did two runs and got one drop with need before greed. Most bosses dropped only 1 piece of gear, and a bear tank ninjaed an agility ring from a hunter who didn't get any drops in the run. A shield also dropped, which nobody needed.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, id say personal loot would be better if the drop rates were higher. If the tble consisted of 5 items like before, it would be fine, but with current setup where each item has 5 versions of it... it will take a while to get them all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so yeah... i can totally understand why blizz reverted the change.<br />
<br />
i personally ran dungeons 2 days without any loot, non stop queueing on my tank, finally im getting loot now but sometimes, still not the loot i want.<br />
<br />
This is completely made up.<br />
Although you do not quote how many you did during those 2 days, could be 1 a day for all we know.<br />
Statistically speaking it would be impossible to do 10 dungeons with no loot. The max you could do without getting a drop would be 3 dungeons. That is off the top of my head but it could also be as low as 2. <br />
The longest I had to wait was a full UBRS and 2 bosses into the next dungeon. Out of 7 or 8 HCs I am almost full 630 gear, minus a trinket and weapon.<br />
<br />
Its people like you that fuck up decent system implementations for the greater good.<br />
<br />
On the other hand need before greed is horrendous. Killing a boss and seeing cloth and plate armor which I cannot use but yet can still greed is worse than getting just gold. <br />
Dont expect to get a drop each time and there is no dis-satisfaction. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

I rarely got anything on need over greed because I have such sorry rolls. Any I won were for greed because nobody needed whatever dropped. I remember in Wrath wanting that trinket from Saurfang so badly and never winning it until after Cata when it was useless for my hunter because armor pen went away in cata. I think they are going to see a lot of kicks now over the tank not wanting competition over drops from others who might be able to roll need on something he wants and also over ninjas who take from classes who actually need something more than they do. I see a hot mess out of this change. At least on personal loot I felt I had a chance of getting a drop at some point that I needed. My main is a hunter and you know how much competition there is for anything we need especially in this expansion when the stats on a drop will fit so many different classes who may not have been in competition in the past. And I'll guarantee you that hunters will be called ninjas when they roll on something they need since &quot;huntards&quot; are the favorite whipping boy in the game already.</div></div><hr />

It's...a pre-made group. As in a group you have made yourself prior to undertaking the conent.<br />
<br />
OT: Yeah, people are stupid. Personal loot was way better. You can say &quot;oh well I didn't get any loot&quot;, but the thing is, you wouldn't have gotten any loot on need before greed either, because it would've been loot that you couldn't use. Bosses have ludicrous loot tables now, so good fucking luck getting what you want. each boss drops about 7 different versions of each armor piece. Before, everyone could get loot that they use, now they can drop 1 per boss, 2 for end bosses. Well fucking done WoW community, shine on.</div></div><hr />

Okay, it may not be MY loot, however it is for MY SPEC, and MY ROLL in the group. We, as a player base, have complained for years that classes/spec/rolls should NOT be able to receive items that they have not Que'd for. PERSONAL LOOT solved this. If you want something, set your spec for it and let it drop. Don't cheat someone else out of an upgrade because you feel you deserve it because you chose to tank an instance and NEEDED on the dps upgrade you wanted.

<br />
Common sense? It's a video game. There are rolls for loot. Even in personal loot if you won or lost something, the game didn't &quot;cheat&quot; you out of a piece of loot. The same way that losing to a player based roll doesn't &quot;cheat&quot; you out of loot. You just lost the roll. <br />
<br />
Either way, getting upset about it won't change anything and you will still go back to that dungeon to get that helmet or whatever item and try again. Focus your energy on the next roll, not the last one.</div></div><hr />

Really? Just because of idiots, who only look for his own self-interest &quot;of needing&quot; everything they can, with personal loot even people willing to trade are actually &quot;indirectly punished&quot;.<br />
<br />
In the end with personal loot, both players lose. 1st by not getting the needed item, while 2nd by trashing the item to the vendor (unless he is enchanter)! <br />
<br />
I really dislike getting the same item over and over, unless I would have enchanting on that character.<br />
<br />
In fact by &quot;need before greed&quot; you can gear upo faster than with personal loot if you are &quot;humble&quot; enough and willing to trade and talk with others in you group. <br />
<br />
In Cata in geared up both Mage and Paladin in their LFR set. Getting the same item over and over and with no trade possible good luck gearing up within 1 month, where &quot;dice&quot; will screw you more times with same item over and over or just with &quot;nothing&quot;.<br />

<br />
Now you will see a trinket drop, and then someone will roll need on it and take it for off-spec right in front of your eyes.<br />
<br />
Sooooo haaaaard to ask nicely for a trade ...<br />
<br />
... am I right?<br />
<br />
Sooner or later some one will trade it for you<br />
<br />
With personal loot some items are just cursed any you will just not get it!</div></div><hr />

Personal loot is 100 times better than need/greed. I don't want to have idiots needing os on my shit, put it the fuck back and get your head out of your ass.<br />
<br />
What this guy said. I've already been ninja'd two times. I'm a tank and a boomkin and ret dps were able to roll on my gear. There is no reason why you couldn't have just made a new toast window for people that won gear.<br />
<br />
People saying that guild groups wanted this change....considering you could just change the loot options beforehand, this argument makes no sense.<br />
<br />
This change was for the 12 year old audience that don't understand that they have a way better chance at loot this way than the other.<br />
<br />
Also if you are a boomkin you shouldn't be able to need on agi gear. So so stupid Blizzard!</div></div><hr />

Why is the looting system an issue?....how bout the 50 minute queue times. While they're hearing the responses of the QQ river flowing in about not walking away with enough rewards, the real solution is not being addressed. There are 10M people playing this game. I play on Mal'Ganis and am routinely lied to with an average wait time indicator of 28 minutes...which after 28 minutes slowly grows...and grows, until im staring at a 54 minute queue. There is no explanation for these queue times.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that bonus armor only comes on neck, cloak, rings &amp; trinkets :)</div></div><hr />

I suggest to check loot tables for the new HCs. Stats itemization in WoD is such that tanks and melee DPS in many cases use the same items because stats on them are viable for both. It happened since blizz got rid of basically all dedicated to tanking stats. So as tank I'm no less frustrated when DPS is rolling on items I need.<br />
Need befor greed can't function with the new stats system. Too many intersections.</div></div><hr />

It was so satisfying to see that ring (after a streak of what felt like 2 full days of chain running heroics) only to have someone else roll need on it. I know it can get frustrating to not get anything after several boss kills, but there's NOTHING more satisfying about seeing loot drop that I just can't use...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jewmunji</div><div class="date">2014-11-21, 07:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vanilla - Present Player Input/First comment ever! I know everyone will gain an understanding and/or agree with me on this whole issue with Need/Greed. <br />
<br />
1st - WoD is not meant for Need/Greed. The new stat system is/was meant for personal loot. The items are not broken down like they used to be. We go into an instance in the past and try to fight for 1-20 items in 5mans. Now we have 50 items each/player from 4 bosses in a instance(or more). 5x5 = 250 items... In a whole instance that can drop. The funny thing is only 1 for the first few bosses and 2 on the last boss? I was seeing 2-4 dropping off almost every boss! All I can say on this is good luck on getting that specific/gear you wanted now... Because it's a lower % now than before. Not to mention with the dual stats Agility/Str or Agility/Int. You're now fighting for the gear with other players that they can now need. Thus, with people not knowing this change, people are now getting kicked from 5-mans because they think they're needing on &quot;Their&quot; loot <br />
<br />
2nd - WoD being new and for the players with Enchanter's Study EVERYONE can now Disenchant, that being said ninjas are happy because a hunter/rogue is able to need on gear not &quot;specifically&quot; for them (Spirit/use or chance on hit/cast) increases mastery and stacking on materials. Why should you be able to go into an instance and get loot every time? Work for it, you should get gear off of every boss. If your ilvl is 1 or 2 away go to Nagrand and do a quest or 2, hey it may get upgraded and be better :D. The chances with personal loot was a great system for this expansion 5 people could have got loot for a 1 drop boss. now it's limited 1-2. Make it 3:2 vote at least. <br />
<br />
3rd - Blizzard had a great design/system and they usually do good for implementing systems, but once feedback hits for new players not understanding or have the knowledge. Blizzard jumps to conclusions and change it by going 2 steps backwards as usual. All they can do is implement a window on the side that shows what dropped/special effect/animation. It sucks to say this but, vast majority will agree on this and it's started out feeling like a old school expansion/Burning Crusade feel. The player's hype for this expansion is already being ruined after a week. There are many polls/feedback to bring it back in. Implement a feedback survey in-game before doing a patch/hotfix like this that will give a warning on changes, it will be more accurate as well.</div></div><hr />

A group role preference for armor and spirit gear can be added which has existed before. Probably the only reason why it doesnt exist is the same reason the developers didnt put it in back in MoP was their statement along the lines that players shouldnt have to play as a healer in non-healer in order just to get healer gear. Unless pure DPS are able to role on armor and spirit items the system is working as intended and no one is getting &quot;their&quot; items stolen or ninja. Players can still not like it, but these calls that players dont understand personal loot are stupid and retarded goes right back at those who dont understand group loot. The haters are being as or more toxic as the ones they complain about.<br />

so since need before greed is back<br />

I'm running dungeons for a week, waiting for that damn multistrike trinket. It dropt today in warforged and 3 DPS (one of them Enhancer) and the healer rolled on it.<br />

And it's equally likely in the other method that the other Dps would have gotten it.<br />

Hey now lets not group up such toxicity as spoken word of all casuals and the majority. It does feel harder and harder later to put gamers in a better light when they act like that though as they condoning harassment. Quite surprised that dispite all the other hostile threads in recent being removed while seeing a spam of hostile threads stay open filled with flaming.<br />

The pole didnt exist prior and is a representation of a vocal minority that visit sites like MMO-Champion. Not like the developers said it was going to be a permanent change. Had players acted reasonably the feedback would have gotten to the developers and it would have likely changed anyways. Though hey some players live for these occasions to be assholes and take out their hatred on other players without consequence.</div></div><hr />
