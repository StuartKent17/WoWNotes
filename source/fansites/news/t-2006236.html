Warcraft Movie Box Office Update<br />
The Warcraft Movie continues to do well internationally, with Deadline posting (http://deadline.com/2016/06/warcraft-second-weekend-international-box-office-results-me-before-you-1201767383/) updated numbers for this weekend:<br />
<br />
<br />
The movie did $31.8 million in the 20 markets from the first weekend release. <br />
It opened in 8 more markets since then, adding a total of $29 million through Sunday.<br />
It was the number one movie in seven of the eight new markets. <br />
Warcraft is still the #1 movie after 9 days in Germany and still at #2 in Russia. <br />
The international release has a total of $69.1 million so far. <br />
The movie opens in China on Wednesday, where pre-sale numbers look strong.<br />
<br />
<br />

Legion Talent Changes<br />
Blizzard has hotfixed talents on the beta realms to make changes to talent choices and positions. These changes are reflected in our talent calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator).<br />
Hey all.<br />
<br />
The last two Beta builds have included a number of changes to talents for many specs, most of which involved rearranging the talent trees, and/or tweaking some talents to be useful in more situations. I'd like to give a little context about those changes, and discuss the further implications of them.<br />
<br />
Goals and Obstacles<br />
One of the goals of talents in Legion is to provide more meaningful choice than before, with a focus on customizing your gameplay to suit your tastes. More than ever before, there are options to add or remove complexity, skew what your spec excels at, or opt into alternative rotation styles.<br />
<br />
We've moved away from talent rows containing 3 flavors of the same thing, to choices that are impactful in completely different ways. We're not going back on that, but trying out differences as extreme as we were has revealed some new problems. In many cases, the difference between talents was so stark in common situations that it became more of a 'test', and less of a choice.<br />
<br />
The Current Situation<br />
There are no hard and fast rules to what makes a good talent row or talent tree, and there are legitimate exceptions to nearly every idea about good talent design, but one of the biggest sticking points is around multi-target damage. Talents can have a huge variety of impacts on damage, falling on a spectrum that ranges from purely increasing single target damage (such as Pyromaniac (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/205020-pyromaniac)), to being awesome in mass-AoE but having no value at all against a single target (such as Fire and Brimstone (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/196408-fire-and-brimstone)). The majority of talents are somewhere in the middle, offering solid value in most situations.<br />
<br />
In many cases, we had talent rows that pitted talents at opposite ends of the spectrum against each other, such as the Arcane level 15 row (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#h), where you had the choice of two purely single-target talents against a talent that offered only a little against a single target, but massive value in AoE. This wasn't an interesting choice, it was just a test of whether you could pick the right talent for the situation, and the difference was so strong that you felt punished for having the wrong one.<br />
<br />
The Solution and Further Implications<br />
However, we don't want to go back to a world where a talent row is about picking which slightly different flavor of AoE you want. We've opted to rearrange things such that you have more choices that mix generally useful talents vs the more specialized talents. Hopefully that line between the theoretical best talent and the others will be a bit more blurry now, and the talent you do choose won't feel like a wasted talent point in many situations.<br />
<br />
As you may have guessed, these changes are going to require a cascade of other related changes, mostly around tuning. Not every talent row is equally valuable (nor are they intended to be), and with new talents competing with each other, adjustments will have to be made. Talents that moved, and their competition, will have to be retuned to become viable choices. Additionally, the overall strength of some specs in common situations will be adjusted to account for talents now offering more or less in those situations. An example of this is Assassination Rogues (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#R), whose baseline AoE damage was low, but had an extremely strong AoE talent in Blood Sweat, creating one of those obvious 'test' problem cases. We opted to remove Blood Sweat, adding choice to that talent row, and will be improving their baseline AoE capabilities instead.<br />
<br />
We'd love to hear your feedback about these changes, and what you think about talent choices in general at this point. Thanks!<br />
<br />

Protection Paladin Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
FYI, one talent tweak didn't make it into this build. To allow Blessed Hammer to still mostly act as a filler, it'll have 3 charges, up from the 2 you currently see. (I believe I said previously that that was planned, but there was a bug with it that delayed it until the next build.)

Discipline Priest -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
PW:s sounds loud now and I don't like it<br />
This should be fixed next build--various Holy school spells are incorrectly playing the Guardian Spirit sound. A similar bug with Druid Nature spells should also have been fixed in today's build.

Warcraft Movie–Inspired Transmog Items Update<br />
An update was made to how mailing the movie transmog items works, converting them if you mail them to a character on the other faction.<br />
The Warcraft movie is almost here, and we’ve been celebrating by equipping heroes of the Horde and the Alliance with a set of movie-inspired transmogrification items. Players who log in through to August 1 will receive special Warcraft movie-themed items on the first Alliance and Horde character to log in. To help with making sure you’re able to transfer your items between factions, we’ve applied a small update.<br />
<br />
Items that are mailed to an opposite faction characters will now convert to the opposite faction items. You can mail these items to alternate characters on a different faction to receive their version of each item. For example, mailing the Alliance sword to a Horde character turns it into the Horde axe. This should also address issues that some have experienced with duplicate items allowing them to be sent to other characters and converted.<br />
<br />
Once the updated Transmogrification system releases with Legion, items received during the promotional period will be automatically added to the Wardrobe even if they have been deleted from your inventory.<br />
<br />
Don’t miss out on collecting these items. Log in today!<br />

This is on a very limited number of countries. If you look at the markets where it's shown right now it's performing very well.<br />
It had the best start in 2016 in Germany for example, blowing &quot;Cap.Amarica:Civil War&quot; and other films out of the water.</div></div><hr />

I simply don't think it will struggle with making a profit.</div></div><hr />

If you look it was top in 8 of the 9 countries that just got it. And it did VERY well before that in Germany and such. Don't forget China and the USA are the biggest player base for the actual game itself. Those numbers speak volumes.</div></div><hr />

It has hardly been 2 weeks for a couple of countries. Like spain and brazil, they opened on June 3rd. So those has only been a few days. You shouldn't shut it down already.<br />
<br />
And btw. A lot of non-fans has praised the movie... so it isn't just for fans</div></div><hr />

It's tracking to open at around 25 million, which would put it at #3 behind Now You See Me 2, and The Conjuring 2. The following week, Finding Dory (easy lock for #1) and Central Intelligence (The Rock and Kevin Hart = money) release, which will push it even further down the chart. It's basically up to China if there are going to be sequels. Again, with 160 million production budget alone, when you factor in P&amp;M, you're looking at 500 million minimum worldwide for Legendary to consider it a moderate success for a summer blockbuster. Pacific Rim getting a equal from Legendary bodes well for this though even if it makes less than expected. Pacific Rim was another movie for them that under-performed in the US but killed it in China.</div></div><hr />

It was supposed to open in the first weekend on the early markets with 20 million and got 31.8, so it outperformed estimates before by over 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
The strong start points to a $30M+ bow this weekend, blowing past earlier projections in the $20Ms.<br />

At the same time they don't want you swapping it around.<br />
I see cookie cutter builds. Quest/Dungeon/Raid/PvP/rBG.<br />
I don't see &quot;choice&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I don't think the movie is going to hit budget costs. This looks pretty bad. Hoping for great success in US and China.<br />
<br />
Really? What numbers are you looking at? The World wide cume is 70 million already, hasn't opened in China or North America, and the budget was 160 million. They're going to be more than fine.</div></div><hr />

Just because a movie comes out the same weekend or the weekend after doesn't mean anything, plenty of people pay for both movies and watch both. Besides it's going to be in theaters another 4-5 months. It's GG, that 2nd movie is so close to happening it's not even funny. I mean be real,Alice got a sequel, and that thing was horrendous.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pandasrus</div><div class="date">2016-06-06, 05:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So far 70 million, it just needs another 300 million or so to be profitable. Let's say, 75 million total for domestic and at least 150mil from China. Yea, this movie is going to get a sequel hopefully. Dumb Americans would just want to watch the same old sh1t. Seriously....who is interested in Now You See Me 2? Conjuring 2 does look good though and getting great reviews also there hasn't been a horror film in a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wow devs are not only clueless but completly retarded aparently - do they even know how their playerbase behaves ? it wont be blurry it will be have X,y ,Z talent in N,M, fight or gtfo/kick because you dps will be 10 %below others - usless banter trying to defend retarded changes.</div></div><hr />

I have already seen the movie and its &quot;EPIC&quot; , if you are a wow player you will see soooo much detail .<br />
If your not a wow player you will love it and become a fan , just a great movie period .</div></div><hr />

Literally almost every statement in that list is positive. How is the movie supposed to do better than number one in 7 of 8 new markets and 70 million dollars made in a bunch of small markets?<br />
<br />
&quot;The movie was #1 in 7/8 new markets&quot;<br />
&quot;Still #1 in Germany and #2 in Russia&quot; <br />
&quot;Presale in China looks strong&quot;<br />
How does reading all that lead to the conclusion of &quot;welp, the movie is a flop. Guess we won't be seeing a sequel&quot;</div></div><hr />

the massive critic on the overall class feeling was probably the true reason for the talent rework..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe because WoW is not Overwatch? Maybe because there are no exclusif stuff for sales. Maybe because they don't have name/server/apparance/faction/race change, guilde service, Level Boost, exclusif Mount/Pet/Vanity Gear and gold to sell.<br />
<br />
Also, number of games sold is not subsciption number.</div></div><hr />

In the US, I only have to wait about 15-20 seconds to get into a game, at any time of the day. So, I believe those numbers.</div></div><hr />

I've never had to wait &quot;several minutes&quot; to find a game. Usually it's under 30 seconds.<br />

Maybe you're a really negative person to play with and people keep marking you as &quot;avoid&quot; on their social window, which has affected your matchmaking?<br />

As for the movie, there will always be haters and trolls. Do not mind them. There could be the cutest, funniest, kitten video on YouTube and it is guaranteed to get several dislikes. I am looking forward to it Friday. I rarely go to the theaters and when I do go it is usually about a week later so it is not as crowded. I did not see Deadpool until the following week. I will see Warcraft on Friday though!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alki</div><div class="date">2016-06-06, 05:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they changed the talent trees around to make decisions on talents better suited for different encounters (AoE, etc.) but we cannot change our talents in PvE unless we're in a rest area ... <br />
<br />
I also can't have 2 affliction specs ... which kind of sucks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Otaka</div><div class="date">2016-06-06, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After two weeks those numbers...don't look very strong. If there are to be more Warcraft movies, and for Legendary to consider it a success, it needs to make 2-3 times the budget minimum (and production budget doesn't even include P&amp;M). China is going to have to carry this Pacific Rim style for any chance of future movies if the number tracking in the US holds true. At least we got one movie, I guess. Probably shouldn't have gone so hard in the paint trying to appeal to the fans. They make up a small portion of potential box office revenue.<br />
<br />
two weeks? what are you on about... are you drunk? :D<br />
The movie has been out for 1 weekend and its already doing as good as prince of persia did in its opening weekend.<br />
<br />
In my country, northern europe, the movie is not even out yet.<br />
<br />
They look very strong for one weekend...</div></div><hr />

Nah, its usually 3-10 minutes of waiting to find a game for me.<br />

<br />
Or maybe their matchmaking isn't good which is the reason why they're looking to bring out a big patch to address a lot of these issues soon? But sure, keep projecting your own issues on to me ;)</div></div><hr />
