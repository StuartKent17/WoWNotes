I wonder why it is always tank gear that drops first kill by Ensidia. Ever wondered anybody ?<br />
Fist kill Levi = Titanguard and so on and so on<br />

Other guilds spend months and months to get the tank drops but Ensidia is &quot;very&quot; often lucky enough to get these drops &quot;very&quot; fast. <br />

We've had 5-6 titanguards drop, with only one person in the raid wanting it =/<br />

Also, they didn't clear the instance, they went straight to Algalon(FL &gt; XT &gt; Algalon) afaik because of the good tries they had last reset. Stop all this hating with no hard evidence!</div></div><hr />

Altough to get the core of the fight on 10-man using the 25-man gear and then applying it to the 25-man is way easier than bashing their heads only in 25-man fight using 25 level gear.<br />

You are referring to me. I am no fan boy. I am just pointing out that what you believe in your head is not reality. You do not know these people personally or what they do every waking hour and how they spend it.<br />
<br />
You are all just jealous, bitter, and jaded that you cannot do the same thing. You choose to live your life differently. If you believe that your life is better than any of theirs, then that's fine.<br />

I guess that's tomorrow night!Alone in the Darkness is currently close to impossible with the current level of gearing, when you have to tank the Immortal Guardian's the entire fight! (Since they are, with no watchers, Immortal!)</div></div><hr />

Funny how many people are saying they have no life or were raiding 24/7 while Algalon is only available one hour a week. How 24/7 goes in that hour is just like the jealousy beyond my understanding!</div></div><hr />

Seriously to people who think they have lives because they don't have to raid as long. You really don't have a clue as to how long you play during the week just to prep for these raids. I'll agree they are skilled players, but they are douchebags who still have no lives. You don't just walk into new raid content and one shot bosses and take off the rest of the week. It requires being that special kind of obssesive, competative, asshole that gets these things done and doesn't really make friends in the process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is really interesting in the kill is the loot. <br />
I wonder why it is always tank gear that drops first kill by Ensidia. Ever wondered anybody ?<br />
Fist kill Levi = Titanguard and so on and so on<br />
Now forst kill Alagon = Tank shield.<br />
<br />
Other guilds spend months and months to get the tank drops but Ensidia is &quot;very&quot; often lucky enough to get these drops &quot;very&quot; fast. <br />
<br />
This is suprising me and I will always wonder why....<br />
Maybe some of you guys will wonder too.<br />

Gratz for the World First. And oh, just to remind people: Algalon is 1 hour try per week. You can be a no lifer and play WoW whole week without even seeing Algalon. OR, you can raid 2,3 times a week for 4 hours each and try Algalon for one hour. Since Ensidia has downed all the bosses (including hard modes) it is easy to observe that they already got all the phat lewt that was needed from Ulduar 25 man. Now I ain't arguing the fact that they might be (or not) no lifers. I don't even know the people. What I do know is that 2 to 3 raids per week with a pro-set of people isn't something to be confused with having no life whatsoever. <br />

PS: Americans are NOT in Iraq (or soon Iran) for the oil. They want to rid the world of terrorist and bring balance and peace to the world with their famous (and properly tested) American Dream.<br />

<br />
Now..on with my point. <br />
<br />
Do you all really think that this is that big of a deal? To me it is expected. Let me explain. <br />
<br />
For all the 25 man raiding guilds out there who consistently raid, let me ask you this:<br />
<br />
If I was to take your guild, pay each member so that they do not have to work, made it so WoW was their job, don't you think you would be killing Algalon as well?<br />
<br />
Skill and strats..yeah...there is some of that, but the biggest sink in WoW is time.<br />
<br />
With unlimited time, unlimited resources, say 40 geared character you could switch in and out at a moments notice...doesn't it make sense that these kills happen?<br />
<br />
Congrats to them, but given the resources they have, if a regular raiding guild beat them too it they would pretty much be fail in my book.</div></div><hr />

How 24/7 goes in that hour is just like the jealousy beyond my understanding!<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you, and the other fanboys are misunderstanding the &quot;no life&quot; notion. It is the fact that they are able to scrounge up their best players at 1-2 in the afternoon to kill this boss, or clear the instance in less then 24hrs. after release even with their realm being down for 7+ hours. Most guilds simply can't do that because they have member who have obligations outside of WoW. You honestly can't maintain these are normal people who have work/school in any sustainable capacity. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I commend them for their accomplishments (and anyone who isn't jealous is lying), they have coordination, planning and players I and 99% of us could only dream of but I think some of you are a bit &quot;blinded by the light&quot; and don't see the reality for what it is.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nightcrowler</div><div class="date">2009-06-03, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually you can argue that some of the ensidia population are dumbass or that some of them has nolife, or that some of them is whatever you want. I don't know them so I can't say anything about that. What I must say is that for istance our guild raids 3 hours x 5 days a week for a total of 15 hours a week and we are far from being a pro guild (but we are good indead) Actually after the first 2-3 weeks trying for hard-modes now ensidia clears all contents in about 4-5 hours? I don't know if they level up 20 alts in their spare time but actually they don't NEED it. The average wow player should play MORE than the average Ensidia player, if they do it or not is about them as people and not as pro-player. Skill &gt;&gt; time spent.<br />
<br />
As for the kind of playing, actually I've a 2 years old child so I can't play that way but there are tons of works/profession than let you easly take for istance a free afternoon or a few days to play and then you'll go to sleep at 9 pm or simply go out with friends (if you want) and avoid playing all evening. I'm not saying that ensidia members do that, I'm only saying that they can and that you don't know them, so you can't talk.<br />
<br />
Also let me say a last thing:<br />
how many people are payied to play football? or to show their ass on tv? I don't think ensidia people is worst. Being payied to play a video-game is no worst than being payied to play a RL-game.<br />
After all EU&gt;US again.<br />
<br />
And for people saying dumb things EU economy is far more healthy than US one and usually we don't do wars to bust our economy.</div></div><hr />

If it was the warrior, why did they keep him as the tank, and if it was the DK, why not keep the normal tank?<br />
IF it was a warrior, does anyone know his stats? Armory isnt working for me atm.<br />

All I really wonder is how you explain to strangers why you're so happy after things like that. <br />
<br />
&quot;My guildmates and I on World of Warcraft just got a world-first kill on what is the hardest encounter in the entire game, and thus earned an exclusive title next to our names!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Nice! What does that earn you?&quot;<br />

In a future job appliation it will show some highly appreciated skills such as: Dedication, patience, able to gather information and execute it, loyalty and focus. <br />

They didnt release a 10man algalon video. Pretty sure its because they wanted to give themselves as much a chance as possible for world first 25 without revealing to other guilds their methods / tactics. So yeah, gz to them because even after underground retards released a video they still prevailed.</div></div><hr />

As Bill Hicks said - 'life is like a ride in an amusement park'.<br />
<br />
And in that ride nothing matter, coz.... its just a ride. So trust me that life is not about doing things for something, or to earn something. It's all about to hav a good ride, so let them hav fun from playing computer games, coz a lot of people got problem with such easy thing as FUN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Achieving something in stupid games means nothing.<br />
Having big bank account means nothing.<br />
Being fameous singer or sportstar means nothing.<br />
<br />
But do you know when it rly matter? When it makes sense for you. peace</div></div><hr />

<br />
Following the idia one of the posters stated above:<br />
Remember the plot of Fight Club? All you are a biologicall mass, nowhere idial or unique, your money is not you, your cars are not you, nor is your work.<br />
They way these people spend their time doesnt matter, its the way of life they choose, and if you think you (who works 5 days a week, and play wow in evening to relax and then post some bs on these forums in order to piss someone off) enjoy this life more than those who do what they like to do, and if they get payed for it, than you are totally mistakening. Just take a look on progamers who play CS or WC3 - its just their work, sitting in front of monitor in office or sitting in front of monitor playing is same shit, the difference is they enjoy it, but i doubt you do. So actually gaming absolutely same part of life as any other activity. Dedication matters. If you think that professional racer or football player is nolifer too - well you fail.<br />
<br />
To all americans out there: well if american guild would have gotten world 1st - no doubt you would be screaming eu got owned , we all understand that, so just bring it on, and try harder next time. And well , leave Iraq alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who cares about a Guild that has to use Exploits ?(Oh right thousand of Fanboys do ^.^ OHMYGAWD FLAMES INC) They are in no way better as other People who play the Game, On Algalon the Raiding Time may doesnt matter but overall... They are just raiding 24/7 so its no wonder they get many &quot;Care First&quot;</div></div><hr />

Where is all the excuses with bugs, difference in time etc??<br />
<br />
i love it!<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, there are no American posts prior to yours saying anything negative.<br />
<br />
Secondly, it's the Europeans that whine about differences in time, not Americans (our raid week starts first, and we get patches first, why would we whine? lol). I'd be pretty disappointed if sponsored guilds were being beaten to content by non-sponsored guilds. Then again, they are... they just like to use the &quot;Last boss/Algalon&quot; cop out. It's funny.<br />
<br />
Or did you just want to flame Americans? I mean, I can understand (I'm Canadian), but seriously... this wasn't warranted. Get over yourself. I guess arrogance is worldwide.</div></div><hr />

Who says we haven't been bored for weeks? :P<br />
Only new bosses are fun, rest of the time its a few hours of clearing the raid zone then slack. <br />
Nothing wrong with slacking though! While the more casual guilds who rage on these forums with EU vs US madness are bashing their heads on hardmodes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, but I was under the impression *most* of Ensidia were married and/or had significant others? It's pretty funny what people attempt to convince others of. I couldn't care less either way, but somebody is lying to make their point look better. <br />
<br />
I can safely bet if you have this much involvement in video games to want to be sponsored, you don't even have the motivation to &quot;pick up chicks&quot;. They dedicate their lives to video games for a reason. If you had something else better to do, you'd do it. This is coming from someone who was very active in a top 10 CPL clan for Counter Strike several years ago. I know what it's like, and when it's all said and done, these people will look back and go &quot;what the fuck did I do with the last 5 years of my life&quot;, trust me.<br />
<br />
I'm not attempting to diminish their skill at PvE raiding, grats to them. I just find the arrogance from the surrounding community that are not involved in something like being &quot;at the top&quot; in a video game, to be quite hilarious. It's easy to sit back and make excuses as to why and what they do, but that's all you're doing, is making excuses. I've learned my lesson. God I sound old. Get off my lawn.</div></div><hr />

Why?<br />
Why do you assume this is the case?<br />
I log in 3 days a week for 3-4 hours a night.<br />
I don't log in otherwise.<br />
<br />
Do you think they're out there farming mats for raids?<br />
I've been sitting on tens of thousands of gold since mid BC and I'm sure most of them have double what I do.<br />
There's nothing worth buying.<br />
<br />
Sure their PvP'ers probably log on and PvP.<br />
But I'd assume a good number log on to chat and have fun with their guild ... because ... it's fun to them.<br />
<br />
Stop being jealous because even if you could do nothing but play 24/7 you could never reach their level.</div></div><hr />

A win for your favourite football team is a win for you and all the other fans?<br />
*Laan taunts random losing teams fans*<br />
<br />
You'll find it everywhere where there's competition, no matter the level and you probably behave like that like almost everyone else.<br />
You probably just think you're better cause you don't do it about the game. The reason for that might also be that you haven't really had a chance yet.<br />

<br />
Just read Kungen's blog about WotLK and tell me these kids have any sort of life outside MMO gaming. They don't. Think Athene, but not joking. You think that everyone in that guild doesn't have 4-5 alts they aren't running through Ulduar weekly as backup characters? I'd love for anyone in that guild to sit here and tell me they don't play 7 days a week.<br />

I don't know, Tun (their druid CL) shows up at the business academy more than I do! I guess he just take his exams serious ;-)<br />
<br />
And the last IRC talk is Kungen is going fishing sometime during the summer!<br />
<br />
You see, when you and I kill Algalon 25 man first time. We'll have wasted more time in Ulduar than Ensidia. And the fact they completed all the hard stuff before the summer kicks in is a HUGE advantage.<br />
<br />
If you ever been in a serious raiding post a summer, you'll know how bad it turns out.<br />

Summer is the largest guild killer. Summer and M'uru (last year) was even worse!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone who thinks that they can judge what kind of person I am because I'm American is a bigot. Same goes for if I lived in Canada, France, or anywhere else. This also applies for people that assume every person in Ensidia has no life. They don't personally know that person, and because those commenters are on an mmo site every day that gives nothing but WoW news, I could say the same thing, but I won't, because I don't know them. <br />
<br />
To be honest, I'm sure a few of these people making comments have a little bit of a bitter taste in their mouths because Ensidia gets to play WoW/go to tournaments, and they make their living that way. I know I personally am a little jealous. =P<br />
<br />
Besides, what would you consider a &quot;life&quot;? Your idea of having a &quot;life&quot; might be different from another person's. If you're enjoying yourself and having fun like they are (presumably), and getting paid for it at the same time on top of it, kudos to you. How is going out to lunch with a friend, partying, or working in a cubicle any different than being at home playing WoW, &quot;life&quot; wise? In the end all those things are insignificant anyway.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Just quit acting like children already.</div></div><hr />

Seriously to people who think they have lives because they don't have to raid as long. You really don't have a clue as to how long you play during the week just to prep for these raids. I'll agree they are skilled players, but they are douchebags who still have no lives. You don't just walk into new raid content and one shot bosses and take off the rest of the week. It requires being that special kind of obssesive, competative, asshole that gets these things done and doesn't really make friends in the process.<br />

<br />
Ensidia, as good at this game as they are, are being payed by Saudi and UAE interests to commit their lives to this game.<br />
False information. We don't get payed to play. More about this here: http://ensidia.com/community/post/92/?page=2#1393<br />
<br />
<br />
They have like 75 guys running in there<br />
False information. We probably even got fewer guildmembers than most Ulduar-raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ensidia does it 18 hours a day for 7 a week. Kinda hard for Americans WITH JOBS TO DO THE SAME.<br />
False information again. Can you also stop believing that you're the only guys in the world that have to work? I study full time at university and make 100% of my income through my own freelance business, and I have more than enough time to play in this guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having 3 full raids each night, all night for hours and hours on end, then using the other hours they aren't raiding to discuss and create strategies the other 2 raids use, that then get critiqued by the other 2 raid groups seems kinda easy to down any boss that way.<br />
False information. We only got one 25man raid and one alt raid, and the alt raid is obviously not raiding during progress.<br />

<br />
People are motivated to do what they do for different reasons. People go to work to get money, but if you already have money, you won't find this very motivating. People have hobbies for fun. But sooner or later you'll get bored of certain hobbies. The same goes for relationships, that &quot;just fallen in love&quot; feeling doesn't last forever. And some people (such as Ensidia, or superstars, or multi-millionaire entrepreneurs) just like to be the best, and the feeling of success that brings. <br />
<br />
Sooner or later, Ensidia members are going to get bored of WoW. They play to be the best, for the feeling of success this gives. But eventually they'll get bored, as this feeling doesn't last. If they don't have new content to beat, to be the best, they'll get bored. <br />
<br />
The same thing applies to multi-millionaire entrepreneurs - they don't need the money, they're just after the NEXT feeling of success. That money doesn't buy happiness, though. Sure you can buy all sorts of junk; fast cars you'll be bored with in days, a huge mansion that you'll only use 2 or 3 rooms of, and so forth. But most important are good friends and good times. Money doesn't buy these things. Well ok, maybe it helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as I am aware, many members of Ensidia are actively pursuing a degree in the large amount of time that they have after being able to completely own a raid in several hours allows them, whereas other guilds will spend countless hours and ACTUALLY void their own lives attempting to do the same. Extreme examples like Kungen's blog for the WotLK release are hardly applicable, because hey, these guys are hardcore. So big deal, he snagged a few sick days so he could kick back and enjoy them how he wanted them with some of his closest guild buds.<br />
<br />
It's seriously time for people to stop being so butthurt that Ensidia really is just that god damn good. The childish, racist, immature, ill-informed, assuming, ridiculous and pointless remarks that this thread is full of make me sick to my stomach.<br />

B&amp; please. Seriously, people attacking them are just as &quot;bad&quot; as they claim their targets to be. So it's a video game, cool? Do you also actively troll forums for other games and do the same thing? Or is it because it's WoW, and you're upset. What do YOU do with your life lawl</div></div><hr />

That shit happens in PVE too. If you and your guild suck at PVE you aren't going to down Algalon or Firefighter. If you and your partner(s) suck at PVP you aren't going to get gladiator. If you have good people to carry you, you through either...all bets are off.

it would be impossible to pay people to raid<br />

Lies. Utter lies. Even if they are not paid, they WOULD have the resources, because they ARE in some way affiliated to Ensidia the Dubai company. And no, it is not a coincidence that they carry that name. I mean....ow cmon ::)</div></div><hr />

WW2 was like a 3v3 arena. Europe died early, but the U.S. came back and owned the opposing team with some back up from russia. <br />
<br />
If we didn't carry euros through WW2 they'd probably still be goosestepping through their streets right now.&quot; <br />

i picked this up from a US thread..<br />
<br />
the backup from russia killed 2/3rds of all german soldiers... did you know the soviet union as it was called back then, launched 1 million tanks towards berlin? i'd say the russians destroyed german morale and thus destroyed germany and not the united states alone..<br />

I'm going to try and use logic here to counter a point I see people using. Sadly, my use of logic means that my point will be entirely overlooked (as per Internet Debate Rule #15: If your opponent's point makes sense, ignore it.) Someone touched on this earlier so I can't take total credit for this. <br />
<br />
This is directed at those who claim those in Ensidia have no lives: Ensidia can clear Ulduar (excluding Algalon) in about...what, one raid night? Let's be generous and say that that one raid takes them between 3-4 hours (correct me if I'm wrong) So in 3-4 hours, the guild is done raiding their 25 man and they can spend the rest of the week doing whatever it is people do Outside. Most every other guild in WoW that's raiding Ulduar raids maybe 3-4 nights a week, and for about 3-4 hours each night. Let's look at that<br />
<br />
Ensidia's estimated Ulduar clear time: Approx. 4 hours<br />
Most other guild's estimated Ulduar clear time: Approx. 9-12 hours<br />
<br />
This simple comparison ALONE should very clearly show that the amount of time these people spend raiding compared to other guilds is drastically less. Ensidia has no life? No sirs, I do believe you are in error. <br />
<br />
As for the paid-to-play issue it really seems as though people already have their opinions regardless of the information presented to them. Ensidia has links and statements saying that they do not get paid to play and many members have stated they have never once received a paycheck for playing WoW. It really seems like unless people are given open access to their bank accounts, they won't really believe them...and even IF they had access I doubt they'd be convinced otherwise. Let them believe and be bitter and make their assumptions all they want...you can't win that battle against ignorance, even if you tried.<br />
<br />
But that's besides the point and I'm getting dragged into a Internet Argument that's not even about myself, so I will leave.</div></div><hr />

Well you still need to consider that they raided overtime until they could reach Algalon and that they probably still do as Yogg 0 keepers is still alive so they are probably raiding more than the average guild, at least for now.</div></div><hr />
