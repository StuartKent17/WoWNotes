Thori'dal<br />
As I mentionned a few times before, the Thori'dal nerf rumor was a fake and its current DPS on live servers is indeed 162.8 DPS !<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rokh</div><div class="date">2008-05-22, 06:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Doing some math on that bow, by changing it from 3.0 -&gt; 2.7 spd, it increases the DPS by about 100-125, totaling about 300 better than Golden Bow from Twins.<br />
<br />
Replacing this item in Wotlk is going to be interesting. We'll need to see about 100 item levels (Base epic weapon DPS of about 146 or so) to best this weapon. They'll likely introduce new arrows to counteract this however, so perhaps we will replace this weapon in Wotlk.</div></div><hr />

Do you know how steady shot works?<br />
Really ppl stop making suggestions. It's been talked hundreds of times in here and these thoughts are not new and you'll only start a new discussion which has been talked over 20 times. So meh...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you be a bit nicer please. Not everyone is checking this site every hour every day. Some might even be here for the first time. And if there is already a link somewhere to explain about the dps of the bow, link it instead of flaming. Moreover, the guy you are quoting is asking &quot;am i mistaken&quot;. Just answer yes with the link and you'll be helpful instead of being some brat know-it-all.</div></div><hr />

You're an idiot. The WotLK alpha stuff is protected by strong NDAs, which is why it had to be deleted. This is information that's already in the game, and we'll get it 'officially' when people start killing Kil'jaeden.</div></div><hr />

So Boubouille and Blizzard signed NDA? Why? Blizzard is feeding Bouboille with all the informations for his own benefit, but he's not allowed to publish any of those on his website? I wouldn't sign that contract and publish leaked informations instead, which wouldn't be too bad, as I didn't signed any NDA with blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspect the spiders on that private server have a few more HP than normal… if for no other reason than to make it easier to demonstrate the bow without having to switch targets and run around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good for you, but then, you're not owned by someone who relies heavily on good faith (MLG) with Blizzard anyway. so sod off to WoR and join the &quot;We hate Boubouille&quot;-crowd over there ::)</div></div><hr />

The WotLK alpha stuff is protected by strong NDAs, which is why it had to be deleted. This is information that's already in the game, and we'll get it 'officially' when people start killing Kil'jaeden.<br />
<br />
<br />
it was a joke =/<br />
<br />
Regardless of NDA's though I do think it's amusing how hard Blizzard is pushing to keep WotLK alpha stuff secret, If competing game companies wanted alpha information that badly, I'm sure they'd find a better way to get it than from comments on a fan site.</div></div><hr />

I would really like to have something like a live ticker mod for this. Just a little Bar on your desktop with the logos of all big radguilds, that blinks green and shows the Boss % and Phase for every active encounter</div></div><hr />

Never said I hate Bouboille, I think he's doing great job maintaining the website, but we all have opinions. And what I wrote was my opnion and what would I do, if I were on Boubouille's place. Nothing more, nothing less.</div></div><hr />

Maybe we're not all huntards and seeing the video was enough to wait for the real thing? If you ever watched the video you would have known that nowhere does it state anything about it not needing ammo. Oh and the other poster didn't post any &quot;suggestions&quot;...<br />
<br />
Could you be a bit nicer please.</div></div><hr />
