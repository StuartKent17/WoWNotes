Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
New SSDs are finally here, faster and more expensive than the current generation. Look for small price drops over the next few months as the last gen is put on sale. New AMD CPUs will be here in the middle of June, performance is still unknown. The new Intel Z68 chipset that allows for SSD Caching and using both the integrated GPU and overclocking the CPU will be launched later this week, with stock showing up soon after. It will only show significant performance gains in video encoding, as SSD caching doesn't make a huge difference compared to actually using a SSD. <br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date. If you experience problems after updating, roll back to the recommended Nvidia Drivers (http://www.nvidia.com/object/win7-winvista-64bit-260.99-whql-driver.html).<br />
<br />
New to building your own computer? ArsTechnica (http://arstechnica.com/ask-ars/2011/04/how-to-build-your-own-computer-ask-ars-diy-series-part-i.ars/) just released a nice guide for new builders (Part 2 (http://arstechnica.com/software/guides/2011/04/ask-ars-computer-building-diy-series-part-ii-software.ars) and Part 3 (http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/guides/2011/05/how-to-build-your-own-computer-ask-ars-diy-series-part-iiicases.ars)). They don't talk about it specifically, but Artic Silver 5 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002EQU6C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0002EQU6C) is standard for thermal compound, avoid using what came with your heatsink. Usually it is easier to connect the case headers when the motherboard is not in the case, provided the wires are long enough. She does mention a five hour build time, two hours seems more likely. <br />

<br />
The staff looks fine to me. And so far i hate the fact not being able to witness the lore and creation myself of this incredible weapon. I do wonder tough if Blizzard is going to scale the staff upward with the next tier of content after Firelands, like they did with Val'anyr.</div></div><hr />

Do you guys remember Atiesh (prolly a useless question as the whiners here are complaining about the looks of a legendary staff)?My problem with the staff is that it isn't anything like Atiesh. I love Atiesh's model because of its pure simplicity. This staff is way too flashy for my tastes. However, I understand that people probably think a weapon like Atiesh is too plain. That is why Stage 2 of this staff is my favorite - it's pretty simple, but it does still have some cool effect to it.<br />
But I still think all of the stages are too short and stubby. They need to be lengthened out a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Suggestion 1: Don't buy from Amazon, I built something in January (Note prices were higher then) that is somewhere in between this Dolphin and Narwhal for about $390. I got most of my parts using random Microcenter/Newegg/Frys sales, but even still, most of that stuff is cheaper on Newegg at regular price.</div></div><hr />

fyi this staff isn't terrible but if you think this passes for legendary ur losing touch blizz.<br />

Atiesh looks like it should look like. I think Atiesh looks a lot more legendary than this staff. The only thing that's missing from this one is christmas lights.</div></div><hr />

A new animation or something might have made it look good but to just make a staff with kitchen sink and trimmings hanging off it is missing the point. Too bad - the original wow team wouldn't have let this pass but they are on WOW 2.0. To be even more negative.. this is in line with Blizz's slide on Wow of late.

I'd like to point out While they carry a close name Shadowmourne was never used by Arthas. It did technically use the base from his long forgotten pally hammer i guess if that is what you meant. And well Thorim's weapon is completely different and since it was pulled form Norse myth his hammer was named similar to Mjölnir</div></div><hr />

I don't know, but having a dragon locked in a staff seems pretty legendary to me. I kinda like actually building a relic for the ages from scratch.<br />
Shadowmourne came close, but you still had Arthas's old weapon as a base model.</div></div><hr />

If you're going to list SSDs, you should be listing those by Crucial as well. The C300 was top notch for the price for the last generation of SSDs and the new Cruicial M4 just came out and has a much lower price per GB than the Intel and OCZ drives while also offering good performance.<br />

In the case of the Unicorn, unless you plan on doing a lot more than just gaming and doing the occasional FRAPS, an i5 2500k for $90 less is a way better choice as Hyperthread (which the i7 2600k has and the i5 2500k does not) can limit some aspects of overclocking if you plan to do that.

I would take any of the recommended computer models posted with a grain of salt and do more research myself before buying anything. Not to be cruel to the guy who does it all, but this isn't Toms Hardware or VR Zone. Posting a list of least expensive components to the most expensive components and anything in-between really doesn't make a good computer. I think some of the PSUs listed are, to be perfectly honest, listed only because they're 'brand' PSUs with high reviews in the past. Computers are becoming much more power hungry with the increasing power demands of the GPUs. I would have serious reservations about powering the Narwhal build on a 650W PSU, no matter how recommended it was 2 years ago. You're dangerously close to the 'limit' of that system, and that leaves plugging in USB devices/ overclocking etc as potentially destabilising to the overall computer.<br />

The C300 costs more. The m4 is slower at random reads and writes at 4k and seq 128k compared to the Vertex 3, but it will take the place of the Intel 320 next time, as it wasn't in stock on Amazon when I wrote this. <br />

The 650 TX V2 is a pretty new model, platform is relatively new. The 750HX is somewhat older, but a solid product. An entire system with the 560 Ti pulls a whole 352W under Furmark load. If anything, the 650W is an overkill for Puppy, but good to have for future GPU upgrades. 352W is not even near dangerously close. Even a system with a 6990 is pulling only 550W, which is why 750W is recommended. USB devices are a drop in the bucket, and Tom's is a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't make the staff anymore legendary though. Personally, it looks WotLK epic, but not Legendary at all, rather boring actually.<br />
<br />
Also, those shopping for PC parts, most of the stuff listed there is overkill for WoW. It doesn't need much to play nicely. A cutting edge rig from 4-5 years ago still plays the game nicely. Now, if you want a killer rig to play Skyrim, Battlefield 3 (especially), and Witcher 2 on, sure these rigs are the way to go. Also, shop Newegg for deals. They have great specials and bundles, plus their customer service is top notch with RMAs. After all, these are computer electronic parts, where a 3% DOA or short-time malfunction is &quot;acceptable&quot; in industry standards.<br />
<br />
You're also better off doing some research on said items yourself. As while sure there's some good stuff listed, there's stuff in there that there are better performing and/or more reliable. Just make sure to buy pieces that have the least amount of complications so they all play nice together once you finally boot up so your Mobo, and later OS recognizes them.<br />
<br />
At this point of time, Win7-64 bit is THEE way to go, there's no disputing that for gaming.</div></div><hr />

I love Atiesh's model because of its pure simplicity. This staff is way too flashy for my tastes. However, I understand that people probably think a weapon like Atiesh is too plain. That is why Stage 2 of this staff is my favorite - it's pretty simple, but it does still have some cool effect to it.<br />
But I still think all of the stages are too short and stubby. They need to be lengthened out a bit.<br />
<br />
Well i didn't have any problems with Atiesh at all aswell, and i agree the beauty of that legendary staff was simply the simplicity of its model.<br />
Why should a legendary weapon look all flashy?</div></div><hr />

<br />
agreed, we've been thrown into a game where legendaries are only legendary if they are bigger and flashier then everything else, Atiesh is a perfect example of simplicity, it's a symbol staff but it's lore makes it powerful and full wow, if you look at the 4 versions of Dragonwrath, the first 2 are good examples of this simplicity which a lot of people like, but the final form has way too much happening and looks like a disaster overall, i even preferred the Data-mined Final version of this, even that was nice and wasn't as ridiculous as this</div></div><hr />

They seem to be overclocking builds since they include separate HSFs and higher-end motherboards, but there isn't really any mention of overclocking, which seems a bit weird. Is overclocking just the norm these days and it goes without saying? If you are just planning to run at stock then you can save a fair bit of money by using the stock cooler and a cheaper motherboard and not the &quot;K&quot; version of the CPU, which would probably allow you to build a superior 2500(K) system for the price of the AMD 965 system which it spanks and uses less power which will save you in the long-term.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed. I admit that the previous datamined final version of Dragonwrath looked better.<br />
The tricky part i guess in the creation of a legendary weapon is the question what makes that weapon legendary. We have never heard of Dragonwrath obviously before, and displaying it as a simple, ordinary stick would not make anyone believe it to be that special (not to mention the endless complains). Atiesh was already a legendary weapon a lore, and did not need a flashy model other then its original look as described in said lore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
USB devices can pull 10 Watts a piece, and we aren't just talking raw power. If they use the 5v rail, they easilly pull 5 volts at 900 mA. Your Narwhal build is rated at about 490W under 90% load without capacitor ageing. Which means that, after 5-6 months with 4-5 reasonably demanding USB devices (headsets, mice, scanners etc), the system will become unstable, and unless you're in the know, people usually jump to replacing memory etc rather than considering the power supply. <br />
<br />
All I'm saying is that I would definitely pay another $20 for the higher end PSU than buy the lower powered one to begin with. If anything, simply so it gives you more overhead for expanding (i.e HDDs, SLi/Xfire). Once you're spending more than $1000 on a PC, you might as well spend an extra $100 tightening all the bolts and making sure it's going to function at it's maximum.<br />

If you want to be smart about it, Uranium is an element, not an atom.<br />
<br />
Why would you use the preface that the person isn't being smart and then immediately say something very un-smart yourself?<br />
<br />
An atom of Uranium is an atom of Uranium. It's one atom out of 6.022x10^23 needed to make one mole of Uranium. Uranium is an element, but that doesn't mean that an atom of it isn't also the element Uranium, it's just a very, very, very small amount of it. <br />
<br />
Maybe you're confusing allotrope's and elements. Atoms aren't mix and match - X number of atom A doesn't make element Y while Z number of atom A makes element W - an atom of one thing has a specific amount of protons, neutrons and electrons. An isotope of that element has a different number of neutrons, and an allotrope is a different arrangement of those atoms (i.e, graphite vs diamond in the case of Carbon).</div></div><hr />

Past that it looks like a battle standard not a staff anymore, this comes from someone with no caster. Now what are the stats of each stage?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">slimj091</div><div class="date">2011-05-10, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only problem i have with the staff is that *spoilers* with all of the lore going into it. what being the home of the essence of a great blue dragon. that it is a bit much for an item that will discarded by the next tier or raiding after firelands.<br />
<br />
i mean really how would you feel if your essence were put into a staff, only to be throw into a closet six months later because something better came along? also sucks that only mages, warlocks, priests, balance druids, and elemental shammy's will be able to see said lore in game. <br />
<br />
this was a perfect opportunity to release multiple legendary's for each class type. i mean who says that Tarecgosa's essence can only rest in a staff? why couldn't it rest in a two handed sword or mace? or a bow? or a one handed sword or dagger? the final weapon would have been determined by the class that started the quest. then you do not have a situation that you always have in every tier that has a legendary.. a situation of have's and have not's.</div></div><hr />

The m4 is slower at random reads and writes at 4k and seq 128k compared to the Vertex 3, but it will take the place of the Intel 320 next time, as it wasn't in stock on Amazon when I wrote this. <br />
<br />
The C300 would be due to the M4 now being out as Crucial is going to move people towards the M4 which means less C300s are being made. Likewise, the price to performance ratio on the M4 has shown that it's the best choice right now. Sure, the Vertex 3 is faster, but it also costs around $300 where as the M4 costs around $230 to $240 for 120/128G models.</div></div><hr />

The bronze colored bit at the top should be it. And those spell tags are just screaming for particle effects imo. You want to remind us it's innately connected to the Blue Dragonflight? Have a Tarecgosa phantom&quot;overcloak&quot; effect have a chance to proc around the caster for half a second on a successful spellcast. Wings, the top of the head, and the tail, all in blue energy form. *Maybe* a roar, but based on the Wrath loading screen, that'd get old fast.<br />

Re: slimj91<br />
The Blue Dragonflight is tasked with the care of the world's magic. To carry on Tarecgosa's will, you have to be a magic user.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hero! Renegade members of my flight are again twisting the ley lines to create an artifact powerful enough to fragment Nozdormu's control over time so they can slip into the timestream and prevent Malygos's death!&quot;<br />
&quot;Don't worry, I'll stop them!&quot; *kills the dragons*<br />
&quot;We are in your debt, hero. Now just follow my instructions and allow my essence to flow through you, that we may restore the lines to their natural state.&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh... I don't actually use magic. What's an incantation? Do I just-&quot; *A substantial portion of Coldarra explodes*</div></div><hr />
