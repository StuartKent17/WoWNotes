Legion - Demonsaber Mount<br />
Legion adds a Demonsaber (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/193007-demonsaber) mount, which is currently listed as a Demon Hunter mount. Currently Demon Hunters only gain access to the Felsaber (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/200175-felsaber) mount on the Alpha, but several NPCs were riding Demonsabers during the Demon Hunter intro experience. <br />

I got my mount after 60 savage gifts, farmed on 5 characters everyday. After that bought 2 decorations and said fuck it, mount is better because the decorations aren't so good looking and i prefer 50-100k at any day.

That's what he's saying. Anyone with the xmas decorations is flat out a retard that hates gold. Maybe someone who is gold capped and doesn't need anymore gold will buy the decorations. Anyone else really doesn't have a choice. Blizzard doesn't really think these things through. This is the reason why I'm not psyched for Legion at all.

That thing is terrible. Mobs enabled as mounts drive me bonkers and just scream laziness by Blizzard. They have like 6+ months so there's no excuse for a class mount to be a plain mob with nothing to distinguish it from that mob besides the fact that players ride it. But DKs started off with the unarmored skeletal gryphon before getting upgraded to the armored version later on in the beta so here's hoping the current demonsaber is just a placeholder. Also not sure I like the head placement of the cat. It's too low and the cat looks more like it's looking at the ground, not ahead of it. The cat doesn't feel like a predator. It feels more like it's sulking as if someone reprimanded it. Not very intimidating. Ooooo, such a pretty kitty ... who looks depressed. Bit much to hope Blizzard will change the head placement, though. Have to wonder if Blizzard animators own cats or even went to the zoo to look at tigers, lions, or even leopards. Cats don't carry their head that low or at that angle if they do. If they're stalking, that's one thing but the rest of the body doesn't suggest stalking. The stance is just outright wrong.</div></div><hr />

I think with stuff like this, the longer you play/participate in the event, the higher the chance at it dropping--and then when it drops it resets and stays low.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerofluff</div><div class="date">2015-12-29, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Demonsaber has several skins/recolors so I very much doubt that's a class-restricted mount, it'll probably be available for everyone to acquire somehow... with only the Felsaber being the DH class mount. No other class has ever had multiple color options to choose from. Could even be a reputation reward, since Broken Isles has Nightborne elf stuff everywhere, and they're related to Night Elves with Nightsabers.<br />
<br />
But I agree that it needs a saddle, armor, or any kind of other detail. Like the Swift Zulian Panther, it looks rather bland and boring. And the legs clipping really doesn't help matters. Hopefully they'll actually fix the animations before launch, unlike WoD's Talbuks that still look terrible.</div></div><hr />

It is one thing to acknowledge the problem, and another thing to go 'LOL, sux for you, but we'll 'think' about it...'<br />
<br />
I don't want to complain, but everything about the 'new' xmas holiday event stuff this year seems kind of phoned in, and halfassed.<br />
<br />
Like, some intern at Blizzard was given his smokebreak to think of stuff to do, and it got rubberstamped with no discussion over how to do it.<br />
<br />
&quot;They can just try again 'next year', haha.&quot;<br />
<br />
Christmas time is supposed to be fun and giving time of the year, not 'how much money can I make off reselling a BoE mount. If the mount and the illusion are both equally sought after, at least make the illusion something you can give someone, besides on a tradeable weapon. The one toon that got an illusion this was my druid, and fire just 'screams' druid, you know... So I can put it on a BoA weapon and give that to another toon, and they can have a low ilvl weapon with a cool enchant to xmog into, but that is it. <br />
<br />
I guess I could make every possible reasonable crafted weapon and put the illusion on them to hand over, but wouldn't it have been easier to just allow a person with the illusion to just add it in a trade window. like old enchanting worked? I tried that even and it didn't work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally understand what you mean, but considering it's the exact same animation as the current nightsaber mounts and other feline npcs, it might be a bit late to ask them to make it 'more like a real cat'. <br />
<br />
It's the same thing with bears, they lollop around nothing like a real bear, which can catch up to a horse I might add so they don't have nearly enough speed in game. I guess the situation is that these aren't real panthers and lions and bears (oh my! ...yes I said it) and they make them run the way they want them too. Maybe they have different bone structures/muscles in Azeroth compared to our world =p</div></div><hr />

Oh thank glob someone else said something! I'm guessing you must be an artist too. Blizzard has had a horrible track record with felines. As a hunter main I cringe at the wonkyness of Loque-nahak's poor body but these models are a whole new level of terrible. It's like they took the skeleton for Loque and said yep that's great but how can we make the face look awful? I know, let's get an intern to draw a cat blind with no reference. PERFECT!!!</div></div><hr />

I agree entirely, that was my problem when I first saw the Mystic Runesaber, which is the same base model. That muzzle in particular is just not what a feline face looks like. (Honestly, even Loque'nahak's face wasn't as bad as these new ones, with the really long noses. The head was a bit big, but at least it was a short less-pointy nose.)<br />
<br />
The terrible thing is, Blizzard's track record of failcats goes all the way back to the beginning. In the closed beta when they first switched the Night Elf's Druid Feral form from the original black cat model (this one (http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/3/36/Panther.png/revision/latest?cb=20091103152906)) to this one on the left (http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20051020135347/wowwiki/images/4/43/Druidcat.jpg), I gave them feedback telling them the nose was hideous and it wasn't very feline, and looked more like some mangy dog thing. Which pretty much got ignored.</div></div><hr />
