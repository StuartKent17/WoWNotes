Gear Changes in Patch 5.4.8<br />
Gear changes are coming! First, in Patch 5.4.8 (which is currently in testing on the PTR), all upgradable epic items introduced to the game in Patch 5.4 will be given the option to upgrade 2 more times for a grand total of 16 item levels. This change will be applied to all items found on the Timeless Isle and in Siege of Orgrimmar. For instance, if you have an item level 553 Greatsword of Pride’s Fall and its Upgrade Level is 2/2 making it item level 561, once the new patch goes live it will display 2/4 and allow you the opportunity to bump it up to item level 569. Whether you’re working on a newly boosted character or progressing through Siege of Orgrimmar, we hope this change will provide you with the extra punch you need to take down your foes.<br />
<br />
Second, we are also adding a new token called Deeds of Valor which will cost 3000 Timeless Coins, and can be used to grant your character 100 Valor Points. Players who wish to purchase the new token can do so by visiting Mistweaver Ai on the Timeless Isle next to the Celestial Court. Keep in mind, these tokens won’t allow you to go above the current weekly cap on Valor, but they do provide you an extra option to gain the points you may need so you can upgrade your gear.<br />
<br />
Will this Deed of Valor be soulbound or account bound?<br />
They are currently planned to be BoP.<br />
<br />
are they adding another 8 ilvls to the Garrosh Heirlooms?<br />
No, the heirloom weapons that drop from Garrosh won't be affected by this change.</div></div><hr />

This is Blizzards way of nerfing SOO without slapping 30% reduces hp / damage done on things.<br />

<br />
Eh? THey are removing item upgrading for WoD as well. This is just a sneaky way of nerfing SoO while also giving non-raiders a chance for some additional gear progression. A decent way to extend game life tbh (though it does make it much more painful to get new gear, 1k valor to upgrade it now).</div></div><hr />

It's better than just a nerf IMO. At least with extra upgrades, you have something to do. My hunter is fully geared and upgraded with 3000 valour I can't use. With this, I can now upgrade all that gear even more and have something to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting and very cool, but since it probably doesn't have any relation to the game or expansion (except, maybe, like 10% chance, of pre-expansion event), I see it being in the blizzard store which is an automatic turn off. I'd really prefer a mount that cool to be rare and unique, not something everyone can easily pay for.</div></div><hr />

*With Australian accent wearing leather Zoo keeper suit* Sadly the story behind this poor beasty is, It was originally a little little spider monkey on a small isle off of Kalimador, then one day a bunch ships all carrying evil Ravengers crashed upon the shore and the mean *BBEEEPPP* Ravengers attacked all the poor little spider monkeys and had their evil way. A hundred years later those poor little spider monkeys *sniffles loudly* they had transformed into these giant monstrosities. Now their bite is as evil as their owners. *turns back to cage and hits Mount over head with Gnome electric cattle prod* Back ya ugly filthy beast. so you see these are tragic beasts.</div></div><hr />

As I was scrolling down and the picture blurred, it almost looked like something out of Diablo.<br />
<br />
Interesting and very cool, but since it probably doesn't have any relation to the game or expansion (except, maybe, like 10% chance, of pre-expansion event), I see it being in the blizzard store which is an automatic turn off. I'd really prefer a mount that cool to be rare and unique, not something everyone can easily pay for.<br />
<br />
im with you, its a shame interesting and unique mounts can never just be obtainable in game anymore</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, because the store mounts totally outnumber the in-game mounts available. Totally. I'd trade all my store-mounts for in-game rare ones simply thanks to in-game ones being rarer and harder to get. <br />
<br />
The store mounts usually get reused in some shape or another in-game later on anyways.</div></div><hr />

Well insofar has been in this expansion they've been restricting certain rep + gold mounts colour schemes to either faction so hopefully if they do go in that direction with this mount that the Alliance get an Aquamarine or similarly coloured version. Here's hoping it's a pre-expansion event reward or *sigh* a reputation grind reward in WoD at the very least.<br />
<br />
On a separate note, concerning the new valour source, just increase the weekly valour cap to 1500 Blizz. People can cap valour fast enough through LFD and LFR if needed. Plus there's been no mention of reducing the valour gating on the cape so it still takes 3 weeks of required sitting around after capping before going though to the next RNG fest stage to get the legendary everyone has.</div></div><hr />

If you wanted to get it done before the &quot;nerf&quot; you've had PLENTY of time.<br />
<br />
If you view gearing up as nerfs then every week after SoO launched it's been nerfed. Join Paragon if you're good enough to do it on week 1, otherwise accept that you aren't and shut up.</div></div><hr />

You can't equip it unless it's upgraded? Never knew Blizzard had that implemented. /sarcasm<br />

You don't have to upgrade it. Upgrades are mostly for when you're stuck on content. Are you stuck on stuff right now at 2/2 upgraded? If so, this might help a little.</div></div><hr />

It was introduced to this game to consume excessive valor points but somehow, it has become so prevalent, so in the end-game of MoP player-base won't get the chance to purchase current tier level gears with valor points, instead of that, they can only upgrade gears. Here is some math, say one gets a gear, one needs to upgrade it because others all did (in some cases one is not allowed to join a raid without upgraded gears) one now needs to have 1000 valor points to fully upgrade one, then with 1000 valor points limited per week, one can only upgrade one gear in one week. So to open another upgrading but still restricting valor cap, is indeed gating progress. Think about that, nothing new in six months, raid is burnt, how to keep players subscribing? Well, give another 8-level to gears is definitely a cheap way, Blizzard is playing around a fool, actually hypnotize its customers. <br />
&quot;we give another 8-level to empower the players for them to feel stronger, so they become more confident in raid&quot;<br />
That's bullshit, they just want to &quot;mind-control&quot; them as well as their credit card. Saying it in a nice way won't cover their incompetence in this end-game.</div></div><hr />

i am a raider myself and doing arenas pretty casually, but this is plain ridicilous for the real competitive pvpers. not that they roam around all day long to kill people but i would really like to see a plain soo nerf (not that it is needed but only if that was their intention) rather than a pve item upgrade.<br />

Little early for massive nerfs isn't it? You can still raid SoO for at least half a year...<br />
<br />
Also the worst and laziest way to keep players busy. <br />
First we get a small isle that is just a very short but very boring grind then they give us a new pvp season without any changes to keep us busy and now this...<br />
<br />
I'm unsubbing either way but it just makes me sad seeing Blizzard come up with the lamest solutions/ideas ever. Is this really what we get after so many years of developement, huge profits and them increasing their developement team by 40%?

Exactly, and it also could possibly make our gear last a little longer next expac, which means more disenchanting mats!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Moonwhile who the fuck is gonna grind 3k coins for 100 valor when they can just do heroic scenarios?<br />
<br />
I don´t think they are expecting you to grind coins, more it is just a somewhat useful way for people to spend their coins if they want. I am up over 300,000 right now, so this just means I don´t have to cap valor every week to upgrade my raid gear.<br />
<br />
Think of it similar to the way in wotlk we could dump justice points and buy mats.... not the most efficient way to grind mats, but just a way to dump a currency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
People are saying it because this is a pre-corruption ravager mount. Just because it has a different physiology doesn't mean it can't be a ravager. This was from before the corruption that altered their species and made them degrade. Look at the current Ravager:<br />
<br />
It has spines running across its body. It has four spiked legs, it has the remnants of a/vestigial tail. It has the same kind of jaw, but for the ravager, it is fused as a result of evolution. Etc. (I am sort of disappointed that these don't have a ravager jaw, though.<br />

<br />
<br />
Making a new skeleton for a creature that is supposed to move the same way as the Qiraji? What a waste of resources. A model is the second most intensive job. A model isn't a skin. A skin is a texture.</div></div><hr />

But it's only 7.5K (8K with 1H weapon) valor for everything, since you can only upgrade an additional 2x.<br />

You are only partially right, the model itself is 100% new, the textures are 100% new, the animations will be likely tweaked. Yes it uses the same skeleton/rigging probably with some new enhancements to it. What is your point?</div></div><hr />

This is basically their method of keeping the people playing through &quot;Wildstar-period&quot; (that's what I call the time between now and the date 6.0 /WoD hits).<br />
<br />
Won't just be a Wildstar period. Wildstar already has an enormous fanbase and the beta-play, raids and pvp are all beautifully done. It will keep the people that switch.</div></div><hr />

It's a wonderful way for Blizzard now to run its business. In the other hand, to upgrade gear for another 8-level is quite a way to consume valor points as well as gating the progress (with limited cap per week), however, still want to ask, does that really contribute to make the game a better experience or it's just buying some time for cheap cost. Blizzard is so low now, to debase itself to a time-consuming level, the end-game of MoP is so menial and I could't think of any worse.<br />

Not so true, MoP beta was what? 6 months? 6 months from now is November, 1 month before the &quot;on or before December 20&quot;<br />
And I for one hope it doesn't come out around the christmas period, it's notoriously bad for progression due to attendance<br />

Perhaps it will be a cousin species of the Ravagers we know that went extinct with the breaking of Draenor, and the old Ravager design might yet get an update apart from it?

100% correct. Instead of new content or something interesting we get an extended grind. <br />
<br />
But most players won't see it. The prevalent reaction is &quot;oh boy, I can be stronger. Must grind more valor. This be great!!&quot;<br />
<br />
What I see is more mindless grind and boring repetition of the same stale content. And now you can sink 1000 valor along with the cost of gems and enchants into each item of gear before you move on to the next tier and replace it. <br />
<br />
Too many people have lost sight of the fact that this is supposed to be a game, played for fun, amusement and enjoyment; not an endless grinding time-soak where you do the same thing 100 times over so you can &quot;upgrade&quot; digital gear and then move to the next stage of doing virtually the same thing over another 100 times.</div></div><hr />

The bear has this AWFUL helmet covering it's eyes and i'm positive it's naturally aggressive face with glowy eyes would have looked much fiercer. Hoping this new mount doesn't hide a potentially awesome face :) (with snappy jaws)</div></div><hr />

<br />
so yea, they effectively find a way for us to spend valor with minimal effort on their side.</div></div><hr />
