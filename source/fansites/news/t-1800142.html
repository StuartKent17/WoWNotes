<br />
The achievements are usually put in long in advance them actually going live. Could a month or 6 months or anywhere in between before they allow flying. Depends on how fast the get whatever they need to make it happen done. I think, given their past, I will go with the longer than the shorter to be on the safe side.<br />

The rylak looks pathetic compared to the store mount.<br />
<br />
I am surprise they threw an additional piece of carrot to entice people to get out of the garrison. I don't think I have seen this many people out in this content, since the first week of the expansion. I know it will be short lived, most people will get the achievement and start focusing on the content and be bitching about that. There is no way Tanaan itself is going to hold enough people's attention past the rep grind to get flying, then most of them will go hover over their garrison, as per usual.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it's pretty much exactly what I was expecting, too. There's no way they were going to offer up an armored one.<br />
<br />
Doubly so since the Rylak is the go-to flying mount of this expansion.</div></div><hr />

Not at all, beyond &quot;woman in techno armor&quot;, which is a ridiculously-broad category.<br />

Samus is a blonde-haired white woman in orange armor who can turn into a ball and shoots energy beams.<br />

Or it is something that will get explained in depth in the next Expansion and he doesn't want to limit the explanation to a small 120 character tweet which idiots will take out of context and yell at him about like usual.<br />

There you go; that response both acknowledges the interest without coming across as overbearing, promises a forthcoming explanation and easily fits in a Twitter response.<br />

In my experience the only way that salvage crates take some ignominious amount of time to open is when you LET them pile up to some ridiculous number.<br />

Otherwise it only takes like, 30 seconds a day to open five or so salvage crates.</div></div><hr />
