Spring Balloon Festival<br />
Spring Balloon Festival (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/645-spring-balloon-festival) allows players to take a short balloon ride around a zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Head to one of the red X markers on the world map to find a balloon.<br />
Once there, speak to the pilot and he will let you sign up to ride.<br />
Actually taking a ride requires a total of three players, so you will have to wait for more players to show up.<br />
The ride will take you elsewhere in the zone and play some dialogue along the way.<br />
You may learn useful things such as the traditional greeting in Suramar city (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/may/HidingASurprise.jpg): <br />
At the end of the ride you are dropped off and the balloon disappears. <br />

Warfront Testing - Thursday 5/10<br />
Tomorrow, Thursday May 10th, we'll be opening up Warfronts again for another round of testing. We'll be starting at 1 PM Pacific time (4 PM Eastern, 10 PM CEST).<br />
<br />
We've made a lot of improvements since our last test, and could really use your help putting it through the ringer and seeing how everything holds up, as well as any feedback on the overall experience. Thanks!<br />
<br />
This test will be Horde only and players will be scaled to the appropriate level and gear for the test.<br />
<br />

Is Blizzcon Worth it?<br />
I think anyone who is a Blizzard fan should try to experience BlizzCon at least once. It's just a very unique experience to be there opening morning and hear the thousands of people shouting &quot;For the Horde!&quot; and &quot;For the Alliance!&quot;. Just the thousands of people that love the same thing you do there to just meet each other and have fun. It's like coming home to me now. I see my guildies and old friends every year and now get to meet a ton of our players and just talk about the stuff we all love and have in common.<br />
<br />
I recognize it can be a little expensive but that's why I say &quot;at least once&quot;. Even if I wasn't an employee I'd still be going to it every year. I would make it a goal to save at least a small amount every paycheck to cover it and just save up over the year. <br />
<br />
It's easy to travel and not spend a lot of money as long as you're doing it smart, its easier as well if you live in North America as flights aren't outrageously more expensive.<br />
<br />
And I'm not a good planner.<br />
I used to be the same way! There's a lot of little &quot;BlizzCon hacks&quot; that you learn over the years. Most of which are usual things you should do while traveling. <br />
<br />
<br />
Book flights 3-4 months in advance. Wiggle the days around to find the lowest price, coming a day or two early or maybe leaving a day or two late. If you have guildies or friends coordinate hotels or places to crash. My friends rent a house for a week and a half and we split the cost like 15-20 ways and crash all over the place. It ends up costing us around $200 each FOR THE WEEK. Yeah you read that right. It's easy to save money immediately if you're not staying at the Hilton or Marriott. They're nice and extremely convenient but you can save like half the price being 2-3 miles away. You can use ridesharing services or walk anywhere you need to go. I know people that come in and have forgone the trouble of renting cars. It saves you the price of rental fees, gas, AND parking. This is more of a personal preference at this point I think.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every convention has these little things to be aware of that makes it easy to do them. BlizzCon is no exception <br />
<br />
It's what you make of it OP. As someone else said, it's just like any other Con, so if you don't enjoy them in general, then you won't enjoy Blizzcon.<br />
This is a great perspective to look at it too. It's fun and worth it if you make it fun and worth it.<br />
<br />
Not as if we dont have venues..we have loads.<br />
One thing that gets underestimated is how huge BlizzCon has become. Its not easy to just move it to another location. The Anaheim Convention Center has a total floor space of 1.6M square feet (that's like 150k square meters for the rest of the world) we take up almost all of it at this point and the new hall that they built which I don't believe is accounted for in that figure. The largest convention center in Australia for example is I believe the new International Convention Centre in Sydney. It's only 404k square feet. It's about a quarter of the size. You couldn't fit BlizzCon there let alone the astronomical costs of trying to make something like that happen.<br />
<br />
It's a big ordeal just having it right down the road in Anaheim. It takes so much work to plan and make BlizzCon happen. When one finishes the main BlizzCon team has already started planning the following years. It's kind of amazing they're able to pull it off because there are just so many moving parts.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not saying it won't ever happen, but there's some obvious reasons why its always been at the Anaheim Convention Center and continues to be. I'd love for that to happen but realistically it's just not that easy.<br />

<br />
A killer like you describe can get easy 300+ years in the US for his crimes. <br />
I think someone damaging the goods of a company should get a punishment like this. It's like burning down a shop, just without the danger for humans. <br />

Why exactly do you think a year in prison is unfair? Personally thought he should get more than that.<br />

Granted I'd preferably have the rapists, pedophiles, and killers not roaming the streets if I had choice between the two scenarios...but the justice system ain't perfect.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't a mild inconvenience. Fuck with a big business's profits, and they will fuck you right back. If anything, this guy got off extremely lightly; he was screwing with far worse things than Blizzard, but those charges got dropped because he accepted this one. He got off easy.</div></div><hr />

Could have fooled me with how sarcastically you stated it. Either way, he had far worse charges dropped, and frankly that surprises me.<br />
<br />
Calling it a 'mild inconvenience' is ludicrous, though. Single-handedly making the game unplayable for a week after a major expansion launch isn't a 'minor' inconvenience, nor does it apply anything remotely as such to Blizzard who lost a lot of money because of it and paid a lot of money to try and get around it. You can argue that playing this game isn't necessary, but as far as playing this game goes, no, it was not even remotely a 'minor' inconvenience. Sorry.</div></div><hr />

Well there are two possibilities, one being you are being sarcastically sarcastic and tricked me into thinking you were only just being sarcastic, in which case this is sarcastic inception and you are just some kind of sarcastic genius. Bear with me, I'm being sarcastic here.<br />

The other being that this is bait. I can't help that I like bait. Don't judge me, bro.<br />

Hard to take this post seriously at this point, but I don't feel like that's a bad thing, to be fair. In reality, you are just defending yourself from being wrong while making up ridiculous fiction to support it, but where's the fun in admitting that? Just have fun with it, IMO.</div></div><hr />

So this guy stole $29, 987 dollars from Blizzard. You think he shouldn't get any jail time. Can I go steal a $20,000 car and just walk off the lot because its not as bad as killing someone?<br />
<br />
This was also a repeat offense. He also tried to steal 10 million dollars from a tech company and failed. But that's not too bad! Let him walk.</div></div><hr />

The problem isn't the computer crimes being unfair. It's that the sex crimes aren't harsh enough. Outside of statutory rape the punishment should be quadrupled.<br />

Also, what computer skills? It was a DDoS.<br />
<br />
Orchestrating a DDOS at that level isn't trivial. Paying someone to do it is but this guy didn't pay someone to execute it. He did it himself. You can't knock a company off the internet by flooding them with a single computer or hacking a business and using a few hundred machines.</div></div><hr />

You can argue that playing this game isn't necessary, but as far as playing this game goes, no, it was not even remotely a 'minor' inconvenience. Sorry.<br />
<br />
<br />
there was no expansion release close before February or September 2010... the closest one is Cataclysm on December 2010, so it was way before the release</div></div><hr />

What do you do when some Christian or Muslim group decides that the banking institution is bad and sinning before God by charging usury on loans. They then go on a rampage DDoSing all the banks in a country or world?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
A killer like you describe can get easy 300+ years in the US for his crimes. <br />
I think someone damaging the goods of a company should get a punishment like this. It's like burning down a shop, just without the danger for humans. <br />
But the damage is done.<br />
Unilaterally deciding to cost others $30,000 in damages and waste their time should be a crime. If we laugh it off, we encourage it to continue. I wouldn't worry too much about the sentence. With time off for good behavior, he could be eligible for parole in 3 months. Enough to make him think long and hard about doing this again, but not enough to ruin his life.<br />

You would kill someone that stops you to play a game? Makes me wonder what you would do to someone that would rape your mother?<br />
This place is full of internet heroes that feel empowered when behind a keyboard... Im Romanian and im not defending this guy in the slightest, but every internet hero here should take into consideration that the process lasted 8 years. So, basically, 30k fine plus almost 9 years of punishment. Granted he wasnt locked in those 8 years, but its pretty damn close to incarceration. Fair? Compared to other types of crimes definetly not. A fine should have been enough in my opinion plus a permanent rap sheet. There are ppl that serve home imprisonment for far worse things.</div></div><hr />
