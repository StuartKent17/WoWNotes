You mean the telegraphed cleave that happens in a direction, usually not straight ahead?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kind of. Even if you weren't moving, the &quot;frontal cone&quot; would instead hit his left side, killing people in the process.</div></div><hr />

Cultivate patience. Where are you rushing off to? You're already here. Have a seat and enjoy this unique moment in time. You'll never have another like it in your life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wouldn't be so irritating if I could predict when the buff is going to fall off because then I could cast it again. The problem is I'll be doing my rotation and with 6-8 seconds left on the debuff, it just drops. It throws off my rhythm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably because it is not a frontal cleave but a side cleave, randomly hitting on left or right (just look at the animation to know where he'll hit)...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup...paid attention to it on this kill, it's indeed a side cleave. &gt;-&lt; The Cake was a lie.</div></div><hr />

Because the stupid matchmaking system in casual play ensures that regarless of how much i play or how good i get i will still keep hitting the dirt roughly as much as im doing currently...<br />
<br />
Wtb casual play without matchmaking so one can actually have fun once in a while. 1 match of owning noobs and 1 match of getting fucked by grandmasters is far more fun that two even matches where you have roughly as many deaths as kills.</div></div><hr />
