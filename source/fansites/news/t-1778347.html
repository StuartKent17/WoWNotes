The Iron Horde Invades Hellfest 2015<br />
Are you ready to see the Iron Horde go heavy metal? It all started last November, when Grommash’s celebration of the lineup announcement for Hellfest 2015 quickly ignited an epic conversation between Warcraft fans and metal fans.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/thumb/hellfestOrc.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/hellfestOrc.jpg) <br />
<br />
With over 100.000 attendees, Hellfest (https://www.facebook.com/hellfest) is a massive metal music festival that no true orc would ever want to miss. Last year Grommash and his Iron Horde were too busy getting ready to invade Azeroth and didn’t have time for a detour to western France. This year, they are prepared…<br />
<br />
So this summer, we’ll be there in person to take a closer look at what happens when these two worlds collide – and we’re looking forward to sharing the results with you.<br />
<br />
We’ll have more information soon about what we’ll be doing there. Stay tuned because you won’t want to miss #WoWAtHellfest 2015!<br />

I agree with what Djouga said.<br />
<br />
FYI. I am 36 years old and have been listening to metal since 1989. Real metal, not what kids listen to these days. So you can take your hipster glasses and earlobe piercings and shove them up your ass. Damn metalcore kid.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't really matter if metal is on &quot;the back burner&quot;. Popularity only matters to the average-radio-listening-Joe who isn't that much in to music anyway and goes to whichever festival happens to be &quot;popular&quot; at the moment.<br />
<br />
Actually if popularity has anything to do with someones musical preferences, their opinions have basically no value when discussing about music genres. In this case yea, maybe blizz would've reached more people with some EDM thing however. I don't see WoW and EDM together though.<br />

His avatar is Matt Heafy and while he's not the most metal guy ever, Trivium had a few good albums starting out.<br />
He has a much more conservative appearance nowadays.<br />
<br />
Plus there is nothing wrong with MetalCore, as long as we are talking about Unearth :D.<br />
<br />
What this whole ad doesn't tell me is... are they making a wow stand on the fest or is the progeny of L100ETC going to actually play something.</div></div><hr />

lelelelel, how can you claim to listen to metal and not know who Matt Heafy or Trivium is? Shit, even my 50 year old uncle who was an 80's metal drummer knows who who they are.

<br />
So very, very blatantly untrue.<br />
<br />
Additionally, please enlighten us with what you think &quot;modern&quot; metal is - I'll be sitting here patiently waiting while you attempt to quantify a genre that has as many subcategories as jazz. If you think the (past) success of a band as mainstream as Trivium is an indicator of the health of heavy metal then you have a very poor understanding of the genre.<br />
<br />
Also, metalcore is trash.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but i'm with the other guy ...people that write in magazines are typically hipsters and nope, metal music is not dead in any form ...it has changed and evolved but it's still good at it's un-modified core.<br />

Hellfest is a 10 year old metal festival and has nothing to do with Blizzzard. You're right, some posts are cringeworthy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ugh. I know the creators of blizzard loved metal, and it was a pretty big deal to them, but they need to get with the times. If they want to play at relevant festivals EDM and Pop are much more popular and have much more exposure. Metal is pretty much on the back burner of music for the moment.<br />
<br />
Ah yes, metal, a genre that has always been at the forefront of popular music with massive airplay. I mean it's such a new thing, pop music being popular, we all remember when pop music wasn't popular, right?</div></div><hr />

1) They don't play metal because they're searching for fame and fortune. They have that. It's about the music you love.<br />
2) Even if metal may have seen better times (very debatable), it was never out of 'the back burner'. I don't know where ppl got this idea that metal used to be in a golden age that has now passed. If you're talking about new bands being mostly crappy, I get it, but I think you're talking about exposition and that was never metal's forte.<br />

If you aren't convinced, or actually, didn't already know this as fact, then you are an idiot.<br />
<br />
Wow... so many people here whining about the state of the game and saying they shouldn't go to this thing, and should spend that time fixing the game instead. Even if they had an actual developer there (which they likely won't), however much that would slow down development would be so small an inconsequential it wouldn't even delay a new patch by a single hour, let alone a day. The only event that could cause any sort of significant delay would be Blizzcon itself, and they just didn't have one the year they wanted to focus on getting their games out instead.<br />
<br />
But I do agree with the people that are saying this is super cringeworthy... I would NOT want to be the guys running the booth there. Probably will get made fun of a lot.</div></div><hr />

Mate that Hellfest lineup doesn't look like anything is on the back burner. There's way over a hundred bands on there covering decades of metal history from the 70's to the present. <br />
<br />
Sure pop music is more popular (that's where the name &quot;pop&quot; comes from). And I know there are huge EDM events too. But at least at this one, people will be going to see the hundreds of bands in one place, not just hundreds of dealers they can buy pills from.</div></div><hr />

So you think that bands who use certain fringe topics of lyrics and imagery for shock value and to make statements are &quot;posers&quot; and &quot;tryhard losers&quot;? Is this limited to heavy metal or do you think this about all genres of music?<br />
<br />
But honestly, if you think Venom are tryhards then you've pretty much proven that you have no idea what you're talking about. We might as well start saying Black Sabbath were tryhards. Slayer penned two of the greatest thrash albums of all time - who cares what gods they do or do not believe in.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that you seem like a very angry person with a very un-metal attitude towards music.

<br />
2.9m lost subs in Q1, and if activity is any indicator (and it has been every time thus far) another 1-1.5m subs lost so far into Q2. That says more about this game than any pathetic metal concert sponsorship ever could.<br />
<br />
We're going to be looking at HALF of the playerbase gone by the end of Q2 and instead of scrambling to fix the game they're pouring more money into marketing.<br />
<br />
I guess there is more money in conning people into playing an over-hyped game than to actually develop a game with substance and content that people actually want to play.</div></div><hr />

Its stupid to say that these bands are posers or tryhard losers since they are in fact the early forms of metal REGARDLESS of what you think about them, and metal has always been a shock value genre. Long hair, loud ass instruments, moshpits and fun.</div></div><hr />

slayer is very good, when they're not singing about stupid shit like that. i don't respect anything related to satanic stuff, i hate it, won't respect it, and would flat out ban such things were it in my power. <br />
<br />
i like bands like cannibal corpse and obituary which deal with gorey stuff, and bands like napalm death which are more political. you can be a good metal band without delving into such idiotic and pathetic topics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Additionally, please enlighten us with what you think &quot;modern&quot; metal is - I'll be sitting here patiently waiting while you attempt to quantify a genre that has as many subcategories as jazz. If you think the (past) success of a band as mainstream as Trivium is an indicator of the health of heavy metal then you have a very poor understanding of the genre.<br />
<br />
Also, metalcore is trash.<br />
<br />
I really hope you didn't sit there patiently waiting for a response lol. Anyways, you seem to not understand what the word &quot;modern&quot; means. It's not a genre, save your snobbishness for whatever forum you like to bitch out on. So instead of saying I'm wrong, feel free to name a metal band from the past decade, and from any sub-genre of your choosing that has had as much success, while bringing/retaining fans of the genre.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trivium blows. They didn't save anything. Nothing ever &quot;dies out&quot;. There's always going to be people listening to things.Nothing ever dies out? That's funny, so where are all the doo-wop groups? How about Boy bands? Surely those are still alive and kicking right? Music's like style, it might make a return every once in a while in some kind of cycle, but there's definitely lulls, and metal, and to a bigger extent, rock is experiencing a low point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On top, the current and arguably silly attempt to create hype and make people interested in WoW due to staged promotions in meta events.<br />
And on the bottom a reminder on why the WoW community has grown to what it is today. Word of mouth promotion of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
I wonder if we'll ever enter a stage of the game again where I can move up to a non-player and recommend them to pick up and try WoW. Alas, one can hope ... even though it's probably never going to happen.</div></div><hr />

Popularity only matters to the average-radio-listening-Joe who isn't that much in to music anyway and goes to whichever festival happens to be &quot;popular&quot; at the moment.<br />
<br />
Actually if popularity has anything to do with someones musical preferences, their opinions have basically no value when discussing about music genres. In this case yea, maybe blizz would've reached more people with some EDM thing however. I don't see WoW and EDM together though.<br />
<br />
This from someone who likes pretty much every genre. (except maybe RnB and other elevator music)<br />
<br />
Side topic:<br />
Any recent games that do go well with EDM? Most of the time it's some racing franchise (Wipeout, NFS), sports franchise or some musical game (Dance Dance, etc) - or the Japanese 2D / 3D fighters/shooters. Any RPG / MMO examples? Especially current ones?</div></div><hr />

The original Leeroy Jenkins video was uploaded 10 years ago to WarcraftMovies. Pals for Life is still around and raiding!<br />
<br />
So the guild that probably kicked (update here, i think the guy was in the guild at least for long time after unless some info i found at their forums is fake) that guy who became famous is now in the front page of this website? I would really love to hear from them what happened to leroy jenkins as a player. Because what Lerooy taught us all was that nerdism is one thing, having fun is another and you can have both otherwise the game becomes purely fake eliticism for useless persons who value wow more than their real life.<br />
<br />
For me Lerooy is the most famous anti-nerd anti-elitist_jerk in whole wow and i value my self as a player who did raid a lot on semi hardcore level and stepped down the moment i realized the guild i was in became what those guys in the video of leroy became. Total nerds who didn't value fun and friends in the raid.<br />
<br />
So ye, please, someone search and find Leroy and give him a beer from all of us , healthy thinking persons around !</div></div><hr />

It's all pretend, and I fail to see how &quot;satanic&quot; (fairytales) stuff would be worse than gore (since I'm guessing this gore comes from humans?) that is also done by pretend but arguably much more realistic.</div></div><hr />

yes, but dedication to evil = more likely. i'm not saying gorgoroth actually goes out and kills people and fucks their corpses, but i am saying they're more likely to.<br />

Eh it's where it has its roots Metal has always dealt with the satanic, singing /about/ satanic matter, is not the same as advocating or saying you /are/ a satanist.

I doubt he was kicked. The actual Leeroy Jenkins video is staged. The event genuinely happened, but they weren't recording. You can tell that they're clearly acting for the video. No one would actually predict chances of survival as a percentage, let alone even be able to.

He wasn't kicked, ever. Leeroy raided with the alt/social raid through most of Catacylsm but hasn't played since. The guild moved to Kel'Thuzad last expac because Laughing Skull had zero population.</div></div><hr />

And lol at Trivium been example of metal. While elitism in metal sometimes reaches lunatic levels, bands like this deserve all the scorn. Basically, bands like Trivium killed and raped metalcore. It went so far that what considered metalcore in the past is no longer referred that way, but just as hardcore, though they are quite far from what hardcore is, just so they won't be associated with that wave of clone-like ball-less bands.</div></div><hr />

Metal is basically the only form of music I hate and can't listen to.<br />
<br />
Ironic that I hate the company that is sponsoring/invading it now a days as well.<br />
<br />
And utterly unsurprising that you're still wasting your time on a fansite for that company's games.<br />
<br />
Is it really that hard to walk away from this? Is your life really so empty that your entertainment is public self-flagellation over video games you don't enjoy?</div></div><hr />
