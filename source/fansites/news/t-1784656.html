<br />
Deathwing &quot;assaulting&quot; the aspect is probably what keys the instance in to &quot;they started in that platform, &quot; so the new achievement wording just makes the requirement clear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probs because people were one-shotting the tentacles and then complaining en masse that the achievement was bugged. Or they tried to split to multiple platforms thinking that it would be enough to just pull the boss from one specific place and then another aspect gets assaulted, even though the original criteria clearly says &quot;X assaulted first&quot;, but people unfortunately don't read instructions.</div></div><hr />

As someone who frequents the Bug Report forum and sees all those complaints about the achievement being bugged, I would have to agree with this assessment.</div></div><hr />

I understood why they couldn't do this prior to WoD (they didn't have the tech to make a profession spell proc outputs of multiple types). However the new WoD profession cooldowns can proc Sorcerous elements, so this should have been done 6 months ago.</div></div><hr />

5.4 hit the downloader on August 14th and came out September 10th. 5.2 was the 11th of Feb, released March 7th.<br />
<br />
Those were the last 2 raid tiers. 6.1 was very, very fast but there wasn't jack shit in that garbage excuse for a &quot;patch.&quot; 6.0 was also in mid-September, came out early-mid October.<br />
<br />
He's right. It will 99.99% be mid-june. I predict either the 9th or the 16th.</div></div><hr />

I'd much rather have it tested and polished before it's released. I can deal with BRF for another month. 4 month for a raid is on the low-medium spectrum compared to the past.</div></div><hr />

Roll it out to everything??? Milling was the only thing left that needed to be fixed. Prospecting has been removed from the game going forward, and you can buy hooks for a few silver that automatically filets every fish you catch into flesh for you.</div></div><hr />

Well the thing is that they cut short the length of time from MSV, HoF, and ToEs when they released ToT.. And did the same again with SoO and would be why we had SoO for so long.. This time we will see what happens but in most cases 6 months is per tier is about right..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pay to win is only legit if you can buy the strongest or stronger gear than what is availble in game, I mean honestly why are people whining? Better gear is availbe off the AH anyhow and the apexis gear has god awful stats on it :S<br />
<br />
Blizzard said way before they announced tokens that WoD would only use gold as a currency in place of valor and justice points, they are just sticking to their design :P<br />
<br />
And again, only a complete idiot would buy tokens to buy apexis gear when there is better gear avaible from the AH and from doing apexis dailies etc :P<br />
<br />
Why waste 120k for gear that you WILL replace, because literally everything else in the game is better than it :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the big arguments of the Apexis gear being pay to win was that HFC LFR gear was listed as 655-660 before. Now that LFR gear has been raised to 675-685 the arguments should effectively be void because the &quot;pay to win&quot; gear is at the LFR minimum and weaker than Mythic 5 man. Yet, somehow the ilvl adjustment reasserts the pay to win standpoint?</div></div><hr />

Where is our story? Where is our world content?<br />
<br />
What was left after you remove Siege of Ogrimmar from 5.4? Not a lot (timeless isle, proving ground... less content than 6.2 has beyond Hellfire Citadel). What was left after removing Dragonsoul from 4.3? 3 5 man dungeons that were useless after you get the gear from it, a new BH boss, a legendary for a single class, Transmog, and a revamped Darkmoon Faire. Roughly the same amount of content in 6.2. What was left after you remove ICC from 3.3? 3 5 man dungeons (again, content that will be irrelevant after you outgear it) and a fishing tournament. What was left after you remove Black Temple from 2.1? A few questing areas, some factions to grind and an Arena...<br />
<br />
<br />
Your point is based SOLELY on your myopic viewpoint. You say there is no content but a lot of players will see tons of content beyond the raid. There is the garrison stuff (some of us like that), there are the new quests, new pets and pet battles, there are the bonus events that will see max level gear from classic dungeons and bonuses to existing activities like pet battles and PVP (which might get more people interested in PVP) and not to mention mythic dungeons. You say there is no story, but you completely disregard the whole assaulting the Tanaan Jungle story... there is story if you will stop complaining and look.<br />

I think you fail to understand anything anyone has been trying to say for the last 5 months about WOD. Once you spend that first couple weeks getting those mounts/pets and what every new items there are, that at most will take maybe if you so slow 4 weeks after that you have 5 to 6+ more months of nothing waiting for something new. unless you Raid at which you get to raid 2 to 3 times a week farming boss's for loot and hoping the next week it has +6 Item levels Bonus socket or bonus stat. At which point you learn it is just D3 in wow raids.<br />
<br />
You fail to understand because for some reason you feel the game is all about some small 10% of players that like re-skin mounts and pets and a bunch of random rare's spawning that give crap all use to it. MAYBE! if people want they can use garrisons which is just a facebook click game of getting free gold gear and items that will help in rely no way for ur followers and buildings Because HEY! our followers are useless now, lets move to boats.<br />
<br />
I understand every one has a point of view but your point of view is every one that is upset should just leave and stop caring about a game they love and play. People like you are the reason we are stuck with Facebook 2.0 in wow.<br />
<br />
I would like to add what I feel people want is a reason to keep doing dungeons like in WOTLK were we would get stuff that would allow us to get small gear upgrades or in MOP were we could upgrade gear item levels. but instead we get no new dungeons because blizzard want to just up the numbers on them so we can get re-skin content and watch people say YAH! new content that is just re-skin and play that for a couple weeks for alt gear. We need a reason to farm world boss's and dungeons to add more depth to gear and char power.<br />
<br />
I would sit here all day with ideas but I will just get flamed for caring about wow.</div></div><hr />

oh boy another fanboy, lets do this!<br />
<br />
max level gear? im at 694 ilvl, there is nothing for me in this patch except one raid which i can raid OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER AGAIN, and OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER AGAIN for the NEXT 6+ MONTHS!, what max level gear are you writing about? Do we play the same game bro?<br />
<br />
Regarding excluding raids and stuff, let me explain something called &quot;content satisfaction/variety&quot; or bluntly &quot;stuff to do&quot;. Before ICC wotlk content was lets say at 80%, in MoP it was maybe at 75%, in TBC i would say even 85% because everything was more or less relevant, you still had a reason to do kara for one BiS trinket for example, for a veeery long time - and dont give me this &quot;you can still do all that content&quot; bullshit, you can jump in one place for 700 hours so its a content, right? Possibility to do something and having fun doing so or having a reason to do so are completely separate things. I know im probably the first one to explain you this i know the truth hurts.<br />
<br />
Current level of &quot;content&quot; (meaningfull stuff to do = reason or fun) is maybe at 50%. 6.2 is average patch, its only 6.1 that is the main reason why people scream enraged, we are way too far behind schedule.<br />
<br />
Last thing m8, why should everyone who dislikes WoD shut up and stop playing? Every good company wants feedback of any kind, being it positive or negative. NOTHING in history improved without any criticism, NOTHING. If everyone pretends to be fine and dandy then nothing changes, ever. But i guess you are not hell of a businessman...</div></div><hr />

Not a lot (timeless isle, proving ground... less content than 6.2 has beyond Hellfire Citadel). What was left after removing Dragonsoul from 4.3? 3 5 man dungeons that were useless after you get the gear from it, a new BH boss, a legendary for a single class, Transmog, and a revamped Darkmoon Faire. Roughly the same amount of content in 6.2. What was left after you remove ICC from 3.3? 3 5 man dungeons (again, content that will be irrelevant after you outgear it) and a fishing tournament. What was left after you remove Black Temple from 2.1? A few questing areas, some factions to grind and an Arena...<br />
<br />
<br />
Your point is based SOLELY on your myopic viewpoint. You say there is no content but a lot of players will see tons of content beyond the raid. There is the garrison stuff (some of us like that), there are the new quests, new pets and pet battles, there are the bonus events that will see max level gear from classic dungeons and bonuses to existing activities like pet battles and PVP (which might get more people interested in PVP) and not to mention mythic dungeons. You say there is no story, but you completely disregard the whole assaulting the Tanaan Jungle story... there is story if you will stop complaining and look.<br />
<br />
I get it, you don't like it. So stop playing and stop visiting wow forums and I am sure you will feel better.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree up until the &quot;story&quot; in tanaan.If you expect questlines,you will be dissapointed.After you build the outpost there,you just do one more quest that includes running to all the flighpaths where an NPC gives you information about the area ( describing the new daylies areas basically)After that is 1 daylie per day that works like the apexis one,except it also gives you oil.THe only story is the garrison campaign which will be limited to 1 questline per WEEK.Rest of 6.2 story is in the raid</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah i think when 6.2 goes live and everyone works out that Tanaan isn't like a normal zone with quests and in some cases is just a worse Timeless Isle, i think there going to be an increase in the disappointment of WoD and the sub numbers dropping.... <br />
<br />
Why did they not do a Isle of Thunder type thing?! A Staged scenario progression zone with dailies. That was way more popular and personally i think worked well. It felt like you were building up to an attack on the fortress.</div></div><hr />

Well there is that oil daylie for your ships but yeah thats the only thing I found on PTR.I saw a post about pet battles in tanaan this morning but its nothing crazy especially if you not a pet type.Rest of the patch features have nothing to do with tanaan ( like the dungeon things)</div></div><hr />

Why do ppl keep saying that when blizzard said Grommash will be the last boss of the expansion? He is not on those 13 bosses list for HFC, is he?</div></div><hr />

They say a lot of things, I doubt he is the last boss. He is going to help us in the end because fate cannot be changed, the time streams repair themselves to the proper course.</div></div><hr />
