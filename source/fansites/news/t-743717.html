Sure, when they forget to shave. xD<br />

Seriously, does giving a dragqueen beard make them more manly? I'd say it'd only make them freakish.</div></div><hr />

Twilight Ascendant model surprised me, I assumed they were simply going to use the existing elementals (never get tired of those guys, no matter how often they're used).

You, sir, are a silly troll.<br />
<br />
I will say, some of the Malfurion model does look a bit silly. As a kid, I used to have a Malfurion action figure, and that's how I always imagined he'd be. Slightly more buff, with a cooler leather skirt, and a normal beard. I have to say, his beard and feet really bother me, but I have little problem with everything else. And of course, it's preference. <br />
<br />
I would like to know more information about the Gilneas battleground, though.<br />

I'm fairly certain that the rocket trike is the new Engineering mount. The one on the right 60% speed and the one on the left 100%.<br />
<br />
I'd assume it probably is, too. However, if it is, that would probably mean they are both 100%, and the one on the left is Horde, the one on the right Alliance.</div></div><hr />

Besides the fact that the Mechanohog is still much better than the tricycles. (Not saying those mounts aren't awesome though.)

<br />
What were you expecting? Some Arnold Schwarzenegger-resemblant Terminator dual-wielding chainsaws? Or were you Hordeys merely trying to redirect the criticism from your absolutely laughable Garrosh?<br />
<br />
Malfurion is a DRUID, and a very, very, very old one at that. So he has feathers and antlers. Sound silly? Of course! If you disregard the fact that he's...oh I don't know... The most powerful druid of all time. It's only natural (pun tiemz on mmo-champion!) that after thousands of years of being the absolute authority on his class that we would take on some of the features you would expect from demigods and so on. There has also been a lot of QQ about his man-satchel. Again, Malfurion is a Druid. I honestly think some people wanted him to have a couple of pistols at his side ready and eager to pop a few caps in the unfortunate behinds of some orcs. This is not the case. He is a druid, a fact I cannot reinforce enough, and would most likely spend his free time collecting and planting seeds as any nature-loving druid might as opposed to ruthlessly hunting down orcs.<br />
<br />
And the beard? Just think about how long your beard would be after thousands of years. Hell, think about how long your beard would be if uncut in an average human lifespan. He has kept that badboy in thoroughly good shape.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. The model looks lame, and forgettable at best. They used to do so much better back in the day, even in TBC days. Same can be said with armor and weapon models. Now though, it's a lot more &quot;miss&quot; than &quot;hit&quot;. Of course this happened around time that their next-gen MMO started up into full swing, oddly enough eh?<br />
<br />
So it's trolling to expect the quality we used to get back in the day opposed to what we have now? I suppose the major problem with SC2 causing GPUs to fry isn't blizzards fault either that it makes your GPU run 100% cycle at the menu screen frying up GPUs? You know, the problem that was in the beta that they blamed nVidia for, though it's happened to, and is happening to ATI cards now as well?</div></div><hr />

He looked amazing and nearly identical to what he looked like in the RTS. Perhaps he did a little to much GTL with his slightly overbuffed upper body, but overall he looks amazing. Malfy on the other hand, looks sweet, but it comes off as a little bit strange. The beard I understand if he just awoke from the Emerald Dream, but the wings just seem odd.<br />
<br />
I still believe he looked way better in the RTS :) I just wasn't crazy about the face and the spiky teeth they gave him. Still, he's my fav character in the whole wow universe.<br />

I know malfurion is a druid and blah blah blah, but he could have looked at least a bit more badass. He did in the rts!</div></div><hr />

Keep the horns, lose the lame under arm wings, give him a white stag mount, improve the tattoo colour, he had white stripes down his eyes. Lastly (I know I said this earlier) LOSE THE FUCKING MOUSTACHE, he has NEVER had one in any art, book cover, action figure, previous game. They made the things he has never had his most prominant things, the moustache is decorated with hoops for fuck sakes. This isnt a hard model to fuck up....

I disagree, I think that these are goblin faction mounts, because the red one looks like an epic version of the blue-ish one. The red one has more stuff jutting out of it, like the horns in the back and bolts in the front. Also, the wheels are nicer; therefore, the red version is the better version.<br />
<br />
I really hope they replace most of the wood textures on the epic version to something redder.</div></div><hr />

And the retarded moustache. His outfit is perfect its just those two things, I'm sure over time I will eventually get into the wings... but the moustache... never. Two minor details, but they really ruin the model. The bear feet are a little silly but I can live with them</div></div><hr />

And those Mounts surely are no Goblin Mounts. I bet they are new Engineering Mounts, something to spend your Gold on like the Choppers in WotLK. The one to the left looks all red and fiery and hordish while the one to the right looks a bit shinier, goldplated and WTF look at the engine on the back. It's a freakin Beer Barrel. That looks like Gome/Dwarf-made Alliance Mount.<br />

@after looking again, it just MAYBE the Goblin Mount after all.<br />
The right one looks like a downgraded version with some parts missing compared to the left one, so the left one might be 100% mount and the right one the 60% one. But wtf... I can see all Taurens riding this damn thing and it will look so damn ugly.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, I like the Thick Hide change for Bear Druids. I'm hoping this leads to them rolling the 6% crit immunity into Toughness for the other 3 tank classes.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, whoever did this model really had no fucking clue what they were doing. It seems sort of silly that the things they added/didn't include on this character are at the level they are. As I said earlier... he wasn't really a hard model to screw up... but they sure tried. Why the fuck are his eyes teal when every other NE EVER has golden eyes... pretty fail. It should also be noted at this time that he has Hawk or Eagle feathers rather than... you know... raven. Is he some sort of magical half tauren? Because I was under the impression he was a fucking nightelf. Both he and his brother have horns, less tauren, more Nightelf. They still should have used Illidan's Model for this...</div></div><hr />

Those wings aren't practical. They're useless decoration. And those shoes? or are they paw? <br />
<br />
But my thought exactly - looks like a dwarven moonkin hybrid, not a Night Elf. Good Elune, what have you done to Malfurion, Blizzard?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bahumut5</div><div class="date">2010-07-30, 06:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reason I'm nerd raging on malfurion. Imagine the basics of that model on Illidan's animation frame, if you really want to give him wings, raven wings spanning from his back in place of Illidan's Batwings. Horns are fine, drop the mouchache, perfect. If you really want to put it to awesome levels, mount that shit on a white stag. He looks nothing like his brother as is, the nose and eyes etc are all wrong<br />
<br />
I think you are misunderstanding 2 things here:<br />
<br />
1. Illidan's body got raped by demonic magic, changing his whole body to have some Demonic features.<br />
2. Malfurion has been training the Druid's magic/power for quite the few decades now. Like somebody else stated: He trained under the Demigods as well. He should be as powerful as a Demigod by now, and it makes sense that he has taken some features from Demigods that have important relevance towards Druids (Wings of Aviana, Demigod revered by ALL winged creatures. Anglers which he had since... idk... I forgot &gt;_&gt; long time since I last read the book, but it looks a lot like those of Cenarius. Ursol and Usoc future. And of course a beard where a lot of people would kill for to have).<br />
<br />
Even if they used to be identical twins, they changed a bit too much to even show resemblance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. I am aware of this. That doesn't, hasn't and didn't mean his facial features ever changed, they are identical twins except hair colour (since that changed) and they didn't have the same eye colour (But his did become golden over time but its not like we see Illidan's eyes). Still a unique NE model (frame) like Illidan would be well served here. He is unique, has some cool animations that would work well here and also has some interesting things. Blizzard likes reusing this stuff, reusing the overused NE frame (which I personally think is terrible, they used it for Medivh...) they could have used an appropriate lore wise unique frame for this one. Both dudes have horns, yeah one of them has demonic horns. Both dudes now have wings... just one of their wings are REALLY FUCKING LAME. One of them is blind... hint, not Malfurion. One of them has a beard... hint, Malfurion. I don't see your arguement...<br />
2. Decades, try millienia. Did anything I say take away credit from from this? Not really, I even put if they wanted to put in wings how it should look, have you seen the concept art from warcraft 3's druids of the talons, their wings stemmed from their backs. Tens of thousands of years and just now he sprouds arm wings... Giving Malfurion fucking Eagle feathers like a boomkin has nothing to do with what you are talking about. If he had god damned raven wings coming from the back like Illidan's bat wings it would not only look cooler, give the brothers more semblance but would also be EXTREMELY BADASS. I personally dislike that he even has (are we calling those...) wings in the first place.<br />
3. Side nose beard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tier 3:<br />
*Cauterize (new, 2 ranks): You have a 50/100%% chance that an attack which would otherwise kill you will instead bring you to 40% of your maximum health. However, you will burn for 12% of your maximum health every second for the next 4 sec. This effect cannot occur more than once per minute.<br />
<br />
*Blast Wave: A wave of flame radiates outward from the target location, damaging all enemies caught within the blast for X Fire damage and are slowed by 75% for 3 sec.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I just thought things through again, and you're right. Malfurion used a &quot;standard&quot; archdruid model, and his hair was blue indeed. But looking at the wowwiki page, none of the concept arts or official figurines share that strange moustache he's growing out from underneat his eyes. I could care less (heck, I'd think it would look better) if they'd be long strands of hair hanging from his temples instead. But instead they're a facestache. Yeah, I'll dub it facestache now.<br />
<br />
And the goblin mount... IF those are officially the goblin mounts, left is epic, right is normal. Left one has more exhaust pipes and inflated rubber tires, while the right one has wooden wheels = left is an upgraded version of the right one. <br />
Heck, there weren't any model differences between alliance and horde engineering mounts, apart from the color scheme and logos. These two bikes right here are not identical models, so.. There's your gobbo mount!</div></div><hr />

Wtf? That's a destro ability that hasn't changed since the last build and is still in the destro tree... ...<br />

<br />
Blizzard is creating a pretty interesting situation for themselves with these dramatic overhauls of the talent trees. One of the purposes of the overhaul, beyond making it easier for noobs, is to make it easier for blizzard to balance the classes and design encounters by having a much more standardized set of numbers (math) and talents to work with. <br />
<br />
The dilemma for them is that if this experiment fails and classes remain &quot;Wrath&quot; unbalanced (which is highly likely) and most classes end up with specs that are blatantly better for raiding (i.e. arcane being the only viable raiding spec in the 2nd half of Wrath) who or what are they going to blame it on this time, besides themselves, and what level of delusional rationale (burst is not a problem in pvp) will GC trot out?<br />

(I guess he's all but confirmed as a Druid of the Talon, huh? Or at the very least he's representing almost all of the aspects of Druidism. The wings for the Talons, and the paw boots for Claw/Fang. He's always had antlers as Cenarius' thero'shan, though.) He's usually depicted as having a very furry face, but the stark placement of the &quot;mustaches&quot; are off-putting. His lips are also too dark for his skin tone, or at least too bold. Other than that, not bad, not bad at all. I just wish Cenarius himself wasn't a recolored and slightly-tweaked Keeper of the Grove model, though.<br />
<br />
Diggin' the Warrior changes. Still eeeeenh on the use of Focus as a hunter, though. It's gonna take some getting used to. Not used to having to keep track of focus like I do energy. As for Enhancement ... one lone change, still no news or even a sniff of a decent AoE that doesn't require a mana dump and a waste of GCDs. As for the change to SR ... aside from having to bust out Magma Totem/Fire Nova for AoE, I'm not noticing a severe problem with running OOM. Of course, things are bound to change at 85, but unless mana costs for items quadruple, it's really nothing basic replenishment and Primal Wisdom can't handle. (Aside from taking a dirt nap and popping up - that's the only hurtful change to SR.) This seems more like a PvP-based talent, or for high-mobility fights where you've gotta put a little hustle in your bustle and chain drop a certain totem.</div></div><hr />

Lastly (I know I said this earlier) LOSE THE FUCKING MOUSTACHE, he has NEVER had one in any art, book cover, action figure, previous game. They made the things he has never had his most prominant things, the moustache is decorated with hoops for fuck sakes. This isnt a hard model to fuck up....

I'm RARELY negative... and I'm shocked that this site is so supportive of this model... its... brutal.<br />
<br />
Because, you know, it's absolutely impossible for any character to change.<br />
<br />
This whole expansion is a bout change, and some of the characters are changing. Big whoop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Hmm.<br />
<br />
Well, it doesn't appear Holy has changed much this build. I am a bit sad that my improved LoH is gone, but I think I'll manage.<br />
<br />
Protection has seen some more interesting changes. For starters, the new Seal of Justice. That won't do much since you need to be in melee range in the first place for Seals to trigger, meaning the gap has already been closed. I suppose it will be good for stopping people from getting away, but that doesn't change the fact that if they do get away we're screwed since we have nothing to close the gap with. I'd much rather prefer the old Vindication, even though I don't have a clue as to the rotation. It just seems that before it had a high chance of 100% up time due to being a proc off every attack and now it doesn't, since Holy Wrath probably won't be used every 30 seconds. And even then, it says a chance. As for Guarded By The Light, we're being encouraged to heal ourselves now? I suppose if you can spare the mana that's nice. Grand Crusader makes it seem as though Avenger's Shield may become a part of our normal rotation. But maybe it's just for giving us our pull tool back every time we finish off a group of trash.<br />
<br />
Not much to talk about from Retribution either.<br />
<br />
Included for the hell of it: Holy Talent Build (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=vtLgDj4.9r8.paladin) -- Protection Talent Build (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=-YcC_tZ5.9r8.paladin) -- Retribution Talent Build (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=7BwkrqTr.9r8.paladin)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think fury actually got a nerfed a little, since they removed Fury in the blood, we got Rude Interruption instead, but it's not going to have as much up time or be nearly as good as Fury in the blood. That and impale is no longer available to us. Not that i'm complaining. The new incite looks shiny!<br />
<br />
EDIT: Actually I only just noticed the changed they've made to enrage. Never mind, Aonix had a point, it's buff. Although I have no idea how overpowered fury warriors are in the beta. I know they weren't all that hot in Ulduar but started doing really well in ToC and are really shining ICC (Gogo infinite rage). However, a lot of the fights have multiple targets up and the fact that whirlwind which is part of our single target dps cycle, which has now been changed, and because rage gen as a new formula (Byebye infinite) my guess is as good as yours on how well they'll do in Cataclysm end game, or even when 4.0 hits with the current content.</div></div><hr />

Community can be hooked on the most irrelevant thing ever .... how about UI changes? Do players care about these? You will be looking at them through the whole expansion..<br />
<br />
I'm curious about the list of UI changes. Are any of the party/raid elements usable/active in the beta now or are they just &quot;stubs&quot;?<br />
Many of those are X-Perl/Grid features that we have been comfortable with for a few years.<br />
<br />
Even if I won't start using whatever default raid and party frames Blizzard will come up with, having incoming heals and dispellable debuffs baseline in the UI, will make those features WAY more reliable then they are now.<br />
For example getting everyone in your raid to use LibHealCom-enabled raid add-ons is difficult.<br />
<br />
LibHealCom is a library developed by the addon community to communicate incoming heals before they are cast. If my suspicions is true, Blizzard will make their own as they did with threat libraries.</div></div><hr />

You haven't been reading up on changes in the last half year have you? hehe :)<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
anyway, I'm surprised at how many people only comment on the models of Mally and the new mounts, as if they are more relevant to the loads of changes to classes in this post.<br />
Let it go, it's just chosmetics, noone shoud care that much:P</div></div><hr />

<br />
This whole expansion is a bout change, and some of the characters are changing. Big whoop.<br />
<br />
Yeah, your right, why we are pointlessly fucking with shit lets change a bunch of the characters. Lets make Thrall half stone and fire elemental just because he is a shaman. Varien should get a moustache that grows out from his eyeballs, wings and because the humans now have worgen make him one of those. Because you know... thats cool. Yep, lets make these changes and justify it because deathwing is ending the world. Clearly you didn't read my post, I'm fine with Malfurion growing a moushtache, but NOT from under his god damn eyeballs. Im sort of fine witht he wing thing, but they could have used raven wings and done it much better. I was being critical of it because for a major character and a unique model they added shit pointlessly and they fucked it up lorewise. Something thats fair to get upset about. It's missed opportunity, they made him really generic and then tried to hard to make him unique, not the best way to treat a unique model.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Malfurion looks as terrible as Garrosh's new model. <br />
<br />
<br />
And rogue changes are very disappointing, lackluster</div></div><hr />
