I doubt it will ever be universally mandatory since there's still a lot of fights where healing rain is devalued anyway due to movement or positioning (or the Y axis, thanks eel boss). It definitely makes it a lot more appealing for fights where you know there's going to be people in your rain, though. I honestly am not sure I can complain about Deluge being a useful choice in that situation. As it is, it's the only talent in that tier I never take.<br />
<br />
I mean, I'll wait to see what the number crunchers come up with but this reads to me like &quot;Echo has some competition in some fights&quot; more than &quot;Deluge forever.&quot;</div></div><hr />

The buff is being applied by Riptide, too. Not only Healing Rain.<br />

This is effectively a 20% flat out buff to single target healing.</div></div><hr />

It works on Riptide on live too. The only thing changing is now it affects multiple heals rather than just CH. Or am I misunderstanding what you're saying?<br />
<br />
I didn't really address riptide because without echo that will be running on, what, three people max? It's a solid buff to that but I'm not sure stronger healing on a few people is enough to completely kill Echo either in all situations. Maybe ES will be DoA now, but ES is pretty subpar in most situations anyway. <br />
<br />
I understand what it's doing and I agree it's a big buff, but I'm just saying that I think there is still enough situational limitations that I don't think it will become universally mandatory. There are still fights where rshaman are going to be raid healing but not getting a ton out of HR where Echo is probably going to still be more appealing.</div></div><hr />

Yep, the War Campaign will end in 8.2.5. <br />
<br />
That leaves the big overarching endgame for 8.3, which is to my liking. Hoping 8.2.5 will mark the end of the AvH war for a decade or so.</div></div><hr />

Huh? If you are not raiding in Mythic, every healer is viable. If you are actually raiding in Mythic, then Shaman is by FAR the most &quot;non-OP&quot; desirable healer in the healing comp, mainly due to SLT and for its range damage output which is not too bad compared to every other but DP or Hpaladin. Please don't mislead people with such things when you have no clue about what is really happening in the healing meta.<br />
<br />
Fun fact : mythic overall healing logs from the last 2 weeks. Monk is officially the worst healer atm. Sham/Hpriest/druid being very close. (oh ofc, don't look at parses because... it's only parses. Max score is far more relevant in statistics)<br />

<br />

<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
The tooltip is messy. The talent used to increase your Chain Heal by 20% on any target affected by Riptide or Healing Rain. Now it increases Healing Surge, Healing Wave and Chain Heal by 20% on any target affected by Riptide or Healing Rain. Makes it a pretty versatile and useful talent.<br />
<br />
It's a big buff to single target healing. In Mythic+ and PvP especially, considering you will usually have 1-3 Riptides up. One Riptide on the tank and one on the melee who is constantly taking damage (I PUG).<br />
<br />
I doubt the 20% will make it to live though. If it does, they need to adjust Earth Shield.</div></div><hr />

I guess i should have specified what i was talking about. I am basically talking about M+ and not raiding. I do not raid at all as i find it boring as hell so M+ is really all i find enjoyable in this game anymore. There is always a better healer to bring to a M+ key honestly.</div></div><hr />

It's literally the perfect time to try out new class changes, when there is no important progression content out. Not literally the WEEK OF MYTHIC RAID like the past 3 tiers for whatever reason. Blizzard has been so scared of making any changes this expansion, and its been one of the universally worst balanced expansions I've ever seen. How are they supposed to design content if the class balance comes the day before the mythic raid drops? Give people new stuff to play with like literally every other expansion has, let it simmer for the months leading up to the new raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
*sigh* this fallacy again. <br />
<br />
WoD was not abruptly ended. There was never any more content planned past 6.2 (from a devs mouth) and the cuts of content came down to shitty ideas for release schedule (1-year expansion BS) and resulted in a half-arsed effort. <br />
<br />
If The Eternal Palace was the final tier of the expansion, we'd have known so by now. They wouldn't end the expansion on a .5. <br />
That's before considering that the usual song and dance of doom and gloom squads always relies heavily on pretending that expansions are to be cut short as they (surprise surprise) don't like the content. Happened for Legion, happens now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
? Eternal Palace is still current content. There's plenty of data, guilds reclearing, and guilds progressing. This statement is confusing at best.<br />
<br />
You're literally advocating for the same old 'what's going to be op this raid electric boogaloo' due to sweeping changes coming out a week before the new raid comes out.</div></div><hr />
