Patch notes<br />
General<br />
Brewfest has begun and members of the Horde and Alliance can enjoy a multitude of activities, quests, items, and even Ram Racing. As Brewfest is about beer and food, revelers can sample the best beverages available in the world.<br />
Hallow’s End: Observed by both the Horde and the Alliance, Hallow's End is the celebration of the break between the Forsaken and the Scourge. Adventurers can speak to innkeepers to get silly masks to wear during their adventures, and much more. This is just one way to celebrate Hallow's End.<br />
New Holiday World Event: The Headless Horseman has been seen terrorizing local villages. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World Environment<br />
Added a new graveyard to the Southern Barrens.<br />
Added a new graveyard to the Western Plaguelands.<br />
Added a new graveyard to the Alterac Mountains.<br />
Added a new graveyard to the Searing Gorge.<br />
Added a new graveyard to the Badlands.<br />
Added two new graveyards to Tanaris.<br />
Added two new graveyards to Winterspring.<br />
Added two new graveyards to Stonetalon.<br />
Added two new graveyards to Un'Goro. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This patch includes two seasonal events for players to enjoy, Brewfest and Hallow’s End.<br />
<br />
Celebrated by both the Horde and the Alliance, the Brewfest is a time to enjoy the fermented fruits of the harvest: pretzels, cheese, and booze! The competing breweries Thunderbrew, Barleybrew, and the Ogres, all come together outside of all the major cities in a bid to outdo each other with their special ales, meads, and beers.<br />
<br />
Revelers are working hard today to set up the booths and games in anticipation of the start of Brewfest tomorrow, October 3. The smell of the first fires are starting to waft through the air and inspire many an anticipating stomach to growl.<br />
<br />
Observed by both the Horde and the Alliance, Hallow's End is the celebration of the break between the Forsaken and the Scourge. Adventurers can speak to innkeepers to get silly masks to wear during their adventures, and much more. This is just one way to celebrate Hallow's End. Read below for more things to do during spooky season on Azeroth!<br />
Join in the Hallow’s End festivities starting on October 18, and you can find yourself face to pumpkin with the Headless Horseman. <br />
<br />
Engineer flying mount price<br />
About 500 gold.<br />
You will indeed be getting a flying mount only available to engineers. So far the news is that It’s a Flying Machine and will only be available as an Epic. You can get the plans at a Trainer and so far we believe the cost is about 500 gold in materials.<br />
<br />
Muffin-factory Ritual of Refreshment information<br />
A few more information about the new mage spell : Ritual of Refreshment. (Pretty much the same thing as a Soulwell, but for food and water)<br />
Ritual of Refreshment gives Manabiscuits, which restore 7500 health and 7200 mana over 30 seconds. It's just about making life a bit easier for the mage, now everyone can grab what they want. We're not attempting to or currently buffing the water/food you would normally conjure.<br />
<br />
Death Knight relic/ranged slot<br />
Possibly a new type of item to fit specific to the Death Knight ? Sadly, it won't be cupcakes. :/<br />
We haven't finalized how the Death Knight's ranged/relic slot will work yet, but I'm guessing it won't be for flowers or cupcakes.<br />
<br />
Lags on US Servers<br />
A lot of people are lagging badly on US servers, I suggest that you contribute with information in this post to have the issue fixed as fast as possible. (See the post for a complete list of concerned realms)<br />
We're currently in the process of attempting to track down a latency issue affecting one of our server sites. We are working with our ISP in attempts to locate the source of the issue; which appears to be outside of our servers and network. If you are on one of the below realms and experiencing latency issues please provide your general geographic location and ISP.<br />
<br />
Cyrillic characters in names<br />
Congratulations ! You just got a free (and forced) name change. <br />
We wanted to inform players whose character names contain letters from the Cyrillic alphabet that they will receive an automatic forced name change upon the release of patch 2.2.2. Allowing the input of Cyrillic characters in names was the result of an accidental code change. We apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause. Cyrillic characters will still be usable in the in-game chat, however.<br />
<br />
Legendaries not upgraded<br />
I know it's been posted already, but people keep asking and keep dreaming, a small reminder is always nice.<br />
Short answer: no. A little longer but still short answer: Currently we don't plan to put in a way to upgrade existing legendary items.<br />
<br />
<br />
[anchor=brewfest]Brewfest guide (October 3 - October 16) (Alliance/Horde perspective)<br />
Now this is ram racing ... Almost (Ram Tutorial)<br />
The first quest you will get is a tutorial on how to use a racing ram. You will need ram racing reins (from the apprentice next to the quest giver) to speed up with your mount, you can consider your speed like an energy bar that you fill everytime you use the reins. Basically, everytime you switch to trot, using the reins 4 times will get you to the &quot;max&quot; level of canter, using it a 5th time will change it to a galop, and smashing the button like mad will eventually exhaust your mount (when your Ram Fatigue debuff reaches 100) and get you stuck in place for 15 seconds. You can also pass near apples buckets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/apples.jpg) to remove the ram fatigue debuff, there is one next to the signs after the bridge and another one behind the guy you need to see in Kharanos.<br />
<br />
Daily Quest - There and Back Again<br />
Reward : 10 tickets the first time, then 2 tickets for each keg delivered. (You can only do it once a day and you still have the 4 minutes limit, however you will get extra time everytime you deliver a keg and you can get 20~25 tickets each day with a decent route)<br />
You need to get a keg from Flynn Firebrew in Kharanos (standing on a hill on the right of the road, next to the armory)/Bok Dropcertain (just follow the road to Razor Hills). Bring it back to the quest giver and do this 3 times, you can use the apples buckets to make it faster, but you can do without it.<br />
<br />
Did Someone Say, &quot;Souvenir?&quot;<br />
Reward : [item=32912] (Screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/reward_quest.jpg))<br />
Just give the voucher to Belibi Quickswitch (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/belbi.jpg)/Blix Fixwidget in the Brewfest camp.<br />
<br />
Daily quest - Bark for the Barleybrews!/Bark for the T'chali's Voodoo Brewery <br />
Reward : 15 Tickets<br />
Time Limit : 4 minutes<br />
You have to go to 4 flags (see screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/flags.jpg)) in the capital with your brewfest mount and pass near them at all 4 locations from your quest log and your character will automatically say something.<br />
<br />
Daily quest - Bark for the Thunderbrews!/Bark for the Drohn's Distillery<br />
Reward : 15 Tickets<br />
Time Limit : 4 minutes<br />
You have to go to 4 flags (see screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/flags.jpg)) in the capital with your brewfest mount and pass near the 4 flags in the locations given in your quest log. Your character will automatically say something.<br />
<br />
Catch the Wild Wolpertinger!<br />
Reward : [item=32233] (Screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/reward_wolpertinger.jpg), This pet is actually invisible to other players)<br />
The point here is to ... drink, drink, and drink again. Buy wine from the wine vendor (or anything else) and drink until you feel completely smashed. (The emotes will appear in this order : You feel tipsy &gt; You feel drunk &gt; You feel completely smashed). When you're smashed, you will be able to see the Wolpertinger for about 10 seconds, then they will disappear and you will have to drink again to make them reappear. (This is how they look like when you're very drunk (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/wolpertingerdrunk.jpg) (or like this (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/wolpertinger.jpg) if you don't have full screen glow activated)<br />
<br />
Pink Elekks on Parade (Same quest giver as &quot;Catch the Wild Wolpertinger!&quot; but currently bugged and not available for all characters, it's not a daily quest anyway)<br />
Reward : 40 Tickets<br />
Visit the beer gardens in Stormwind, Darnassus, the Exodar/Silvermoon, Thunder Bluff, Undercity (they're small camp at the entrance of each city, see example (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/stormwind.jpg)) and zap 3 Elekks at each location. You have to be drunk as well for this quest.<br />
<br />
Seek the Saboteurs<br />
Every hour, Dark Iron dwarves will attack the brewfest camp (Screenshot #1 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/diattack1.jpg), Screenshot #2 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/diattack2.jpg), Screenshot #3 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/diattack3.jpg)), during the attack you can use Complimentary Brewfest Sampler in your inventory to throw them at the attackers, Belbi Quickswitch will give you a Brewfest Prize Ticket for each dwarf you knock down.<br />
After the attack, you will be able to get a quest from plans on the ground (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/sabotage.jpg). This quest requires you to go in Blackrock Depths (Grim Guzzler tavern) to find a guy. He roams in the room, behind the barrels most of the time, and will hide behind the plans seller (see screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/brd.jpg)) when you come too close. Just talk to him and you will get the [item=34140] (Screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/reward_quest.jpg))<br />
<br />
Tickets rewards<br />
You can buy tons of things with tickets. All these items (including mounts and [item=33927]) will last after the events. The &quot;Honorary Brewer&quot; hand stamp will let you buy [item=33976] and [item=33977] from the apprentice (10 gold for the normal mount, 100 gold for the epic one). You need 600 tickets for the mounts, 100 for the goggles. <br />
<br />
The mount is the same for horde players, and is permanent too.<br />
<br />

<br />
And this is why you want the goggles, badly. (Horde players will get a female orc transformation)<br />

<br />
The Headless Horseman information<br />
He's not on live servers yet, but people will ask about it anyway. The Headless Horseman is a boss found in Scarlet Monastery's Graveyard during Hallow's end event. (October 18 - November 1) You can easily take him down with a 5 man group (probably 3 or 4 with a decent gear) and chances are very high that you will get some epix. Among the loots you will find broom mounts, a rare and epic version of each mount, 60% and 100%/270% speed, non-flying and flying. (A video of the 260% flying broo mount is available, streaming here (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bDyp8H3_oo) and high quality version download here (http://rapidshare.com/files/42829091/broommount.wmv)).<br />

Oh and about the horseman. Since you need a quest to summon him, and there's no such thing as &quot;heroic&quot; SM, i'd say you can do it aslong as you have someone with the quest in the group.</div></div><hr />

I've somehow managed to do it 3 times so far. It reset once before the Daily reset timer, then again when it rolled around.<br />
Definitely possible to do, just stay on the Ram and go between Cantor and Trot depending on how high Fatigue gets and once all 4 barks are done ditch the ram for your mount and ride back.</div></div><hr />

Problem is that you cant complete the quest-objectives, your server are lucky I guess if it's working properly, it's not possible to do on servers where it's bugged atleast :p</div></div><hr />

yes, the elekk quest can be done at anytime, you dont need to fight somethin, just use the item you get on the elekks in front of the captial cities (you can only see them if you are completley smashed)</div></div><hr />

So far at lvl 70 I was able to do all the initial quests, 1 repeatable (daily?) of the beer runs, and can't do the Pink Elekks (under lvl 70?). Grand total of 37 tickets. 600/37 = 16 days (3 more than the event runs for &gt;_&gt;). What am I missing or is my server bugged?<br />
<br />
Well ever hour on the half hour the Dark Iron Dwarves attack, but how do you stop them? What I've read so far is you use the complimentary brewfest sampler but everytime I loot them they are empty ??? What about Dark Iron Ale Mugs and throw those? That's my best guess so far since you get 5 as a quest reward from the dwarf in BRD. Didn't have a chance to try it out before they despawned last night so hoping to try it out tonight and catch up on my tickets.<br />
<br />
Input please! I love collecting mounts and having a ram on a horde toon would just be awesome. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since picking up these mugs from the tables seems to be broken, here's how to get them and thus defeat the dark iron dwarves when they attack:<br />
<br />
1. /wave at one of the NPCs in the camp who are holding 2 golden glowing mugs.<br />
2. They'll throw you one of these<br />
3. Hotkey it<br />
4. When you throw it, as long as you're within range (30 yards or so) of one of those NPCs, they'll immediately throw another one to you. <br />
<br />
With a hotkey it's ridiculously easy to get 20+ dark iron dwarves knocked down during an attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/wave the ogre with the two glowing yellow mugs (he's standing by the ogre brew tent). He tosses you a mug. Just put this on your actionbar and when you use it, he tosses you another. You get drunk everytime you use it. If you'd like you can turn off the glow effect to remove the blurriness but the tunnel vision remains. The mugs have a cast timer so no &quot;spamming&quot; this button so to speak but it's a fast cast.<br />
<br />
When the dwarves arrive just aim your toon in the general direction of them and use the mug. It automatically throws it and will find a target to hit. Now I don't know the exact hit rate, but I do know this; If you have a ton of people there doing this, the dwarves will keep on coming. I mean non-stop so it seemed. I'd say a good 5 minutes before they called a retreat.<br />
<br />
When the event is over, go talk to the goblin to turn in your marks. I didn't &quot;see&quot; them in my bags so it may be a buff i missed or something else, but either which way I had 25 marks (the cap) and so got 25 tickets. Just do this 4 times a day for 6 days and you have your riding ram ;D</div></div><hr />

You get a buff if you've bonked some Dark Iron Dwarves. If you have that buff you can 'turn in' your marks in exchange for that number of tickets. I usually get 20-25 for an attack. Also, if you listen closely the computer tallies the total number of Dwarves killed and the leader announces it before they go into retreat. That's kinda cool.</div></div><hr />

and yeah, the &quot;yell&quot; quest, you don't actually do anything. you just ride by the flags infront of each place. however, although it work for me, it is definitely bugged on some realms.</div></div><hr />

You're not meant to yell anything. From what I've read, you just need to ride past the flags at the indicated areas. Your character says something automatically &amp; the quest objective updates. But it's bugged atm &amp; when your ride past nothing happens.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes you will get a bugged instance and the NPC Coren Direbrew will not spawn. (this happened to us when we first did it).<br />
<br />
If this is the case, you will have to reset the instance until the event is working. The way you can tell its working is by several Dark Iron Dwarves by the instance entrance, along with a drilling machine, similar to those that appear during the brewfest attacks. Sorry, dont have a screenshot. They appear in the area to the right upon zoning.<br />
<br />
Personally, i had to reset the instance twice before the dwarves and machine appeared, allowing me and my group to go and complete the quest.</div></div><hr />

It's not Brewfest, it's just a big spam event!<br />
<br />
Bugged on Khaz'Goroth EU (horde) atm are the pink elekk and both &quot;yell-quests&quot;...<br />
so the only chance to make enough tickets for a mount in the near future is the hourly dwarf event thing.<br />
<br />
people spam og with &quot;visit the brew fest&quot;-macros all day long because they are too stupid to accept that the quest is buggy and so they have to yell stuff themselves trying make the quest work...<br />
<br />
others spam the npcs at the hourly event with /wave-macros because they think they might throw their beer faster then... omfg...<br />
<br />
this is the worst event ever! such a few quests and then they are all bugged.<br />

hopefully the horseman won't be bugged like that...</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;We've recently applied a number of hotfixes for the new Brewfest holiday event.<br />
<br />
As we’ve seen a large number of issues stem from the Dark Iron attacks on Brewfest, both for our players and the game service, they have been temporarily disabled. At this time we’re still in the process of evaluating the situation and developing a better solution; however we hope to see the Dark Iron dwarves resume their attacks as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Until then we’ve increased the ticket rewards for the daily &quot;Bark For...&quot; quests from 15 to 40 tickets, and kegs are now worth 3 tickets for the delivery quest that can be performed every 12 hours. This still allows everyone to gain tickets at a rate comparable to what we intended the average player to be able to achieve before the Dark Iron attacks were disabled. For some players, especially on realms where tickets from the attacks were difficult to achieve, the amount of tickets received per-day could actually be increased.<br />
<br />
As the Dark Iron attacks have stopped, we’ve removed the ability to obtain a “Complimentary Brewfest Sampler” by /waving at Brewfest barkers and maidens. This will remain disabled and should the attacks begin again the samplers will be obtained through alternate means.&quot;</div></div><hr />

You can turn in the buff mid-fight and get more fyi, if they ever turn it back on. I did the 73 post-25 cap.</div></div><hr />
