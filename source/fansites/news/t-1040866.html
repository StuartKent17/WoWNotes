Asian looking? Not every girl looking like a plank happens to be Asian.<br />
<br />
She's a young girl/woman. And remember that Diablo is set in a medieval world, where 'regular people' didn't tend to be 'voluptuous' - further accentuating the skinny facial features.</div></div><hr />

Good to see you have no idea what you're talking about, then. These cinematics take a hell of a lot of work, which is why WoW's ones usually come out a month or two before the expansion itself, not with the preview. The cinematics for expansions make use of the in-game engine because it's much cheaper and easier than a full blown cinematic experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ever thought of a reason why western games, such as WoW and even including GW2 and SWTOR had such bad graphics? Because people are afraid of awesome graphics looking too much like anime, and instantly start complaining about it.<br />

Bashiok said that all of cinematics left in D3 will be full CGI and there are many of them. There are 10 intros 1 for all class/gender too but it's in the same style as the first minute of opening cinematic.:D</div></div><hr />

Activision!&quot; That's what they said, right? Because Activision runs Blizzard. Guess what, they said Blizzard. Now this should put to bed anyone saying Activision runs Blizzard. Except Activision pretty much do dictate to Blizzard what they should be doing, which is overwhelmingly obvious if you look at the direction of WoW since the 'merger'. Activision has much greater clout in the industry than Blizzard do. On terms of the cinematic, it was ok. I did like the pencil style bit, and it was nice to see some of the angels fighting. But overall I found it disappointing for an opening cinematic. Compare it to the opening of WC3 and D2 and you can see that it really lacks a certain edge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She's a young girl/woman. And remember that Diablo is set in a medieval world, where 'regular people' didn't tend to be 'voluptuous' - further accentuating the skinny facial features.<br />
<br />
no, she is definately asian/anamie looking and doesnt fit in with the rest of it. We dont want pretty girls. A lot of the appeal of D1 and more so D2 was that at times the cinematics were very dark, look at Baal in the d2 expansion cinematic. <br />
Yes the animation isnt as good but Baal is far more realistic (also bear in miond the d2 ones were made what? 10 years ago?).<br />

That girl is too disney/cute/asian - maybe the lord of terror will rip her face off and eat it - but i doubt it.</div></div><hr />

OH MY GOD EPIC CINEMATIC IT GAVE ME CHILLS!!!!<br />
Ehm,really? Nothing happened in there.What is your reaction on the SWToR cinematics which are far better than this?<br />
I bet...nothing cause it's not blizzard? I think i'm right.<br />
<br />
Maybe they didn't get to watch those cinematics. I for one haven't seen all of it, however, in the case of D3 having been aware of some of the major plotlines that are to be revealed in-game, I found the cinematic sufficient and effective, and this the thing about Blizzard, even they have been missing it on WoW, these guys are about completeness. Hence, the cinematic will make more sense when you play the game, as it was done with previous Diablo titles.<br />
<br />
Off-topic: Regarding, SW: ToR, even though I didn't like the Sith Inquisitor ending, the game in terms of its story elements seem promising whereas gameplay-wise it doesn't, yet I will play it for the stories, just as I do with every other game...<br />

She will be even cuter when she gets to be the new vessel for Diablo...<br />
<br />
...and the dark concept does not by any means relate to everything being ugly, the darkness is in the feel of the looming terror and within the eyes of those who face it, as the faces are mere disguises to souls, masking the reality.</div></div><hr />

Well i should be more specific. Yes I'm looking forward to the Warcraft movie. What i meant to say is make a diablo movie ;)</div></div><hr />

No Joke. I want my 2 minutes back.<br />
<br />
<br />
That was sufficiently boring.<br />
<br />
It's amazing the amount of halfassery it takes to satisfy some of these WoW babies. <br />
<br />
If only they existed in the days of D1 and II, no one would have bought them for the rich storyline.</div></div><hr />

Compared to what D3 is, D1 and D2 are only former shadows, and don't forget how much of a pain D2 was before LoD, though your nick kinda hints at a hating hipster gone mainstream.<br />
<br />
Oh and this is coming from someone who had played these games around their launch with a maximum of a year margin of latency of me putting my hands on them, oh and I am someone who is in his early twenties, do the calculations :)<br />
<br />
You and your kind's hipsterness of hatred has gone mainstream, so find yourself another thing to feed on...</div></div><hr />
