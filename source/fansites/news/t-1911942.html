Alpha Realm Maintenance - 12/1/15<br />
Greetings Friends and Testers! <br />
<br />
The Alpha realms have been shut down for maintenance in order to deploy a new build. We are currently estimating realms to be offline for the remainder of the day, and returning sometime on Wednesday. Updates will be provided tomorrow once we have a better ETA.<br />
<br />
I'll be leaving this thread open for general discussion as long as people remain civil and follow forum rules.<br />
<br />
Deploying a new build right before finals week? Cruel and unusual punishment. (I can't wait though, the failure will be extremely fun.)<br />
<br />
You should be able to fit all the studying in today right?<br />
<br />
<br />

Draenor Perks in Legion<br />
The Draenor Perks will be retiring in Legion. However, many of their effects will be &quot;baked in&quot; to the baseline abilities. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/394917-perks-in-legion/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16884598987?page=1#4))<br />

Classes<br />
ShS used to be our 41 and now you're giving it to assassination only? Uh....<br />
Our intention is for Subtlety to be *better* at Shadowstep than the other specs, due to having a better version of it. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/671407153022935040))<br />
If Shadowstrike isn't meeting that intention, we'll iterate as needed until we reach that goal. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/671407412348362753))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Can you confirm that the legendary effects will, or will not, work in rated/non-rated PvP?<br />
Legendary effects will not work in instanced PvP (like Battlegrounds or Arenas). They *will* work in World PvP. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/671408664423620608))<br />
<br />
are Artifact talents working in pvp? Cause so far with talents/pvp looked good. Artifact is looking potentially game breaking <br />
Artifact traits will work in all PvP situations. If a particular trait is problematic, we will address it. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/671409189911183361))<br />
<br />
hey what level do we get the honor levels? and what would be the max honor level at level 20? just so i can get a grasp on this<br />
The Honor system and PvP talents are only for max level players. For #Legion, that's 110. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/671410399221280768))<br />

Legion - Fishing Artifact<br />
If you aren't following us on Twitter (https://twitter.com/MMOChampion), you may have missed that we added the Fishing Artifact to the calculator over the weekend!<br />

<br />
It's not a skill tree. In skill tree you have to choose carefully what you want to take, because you can't possibly fit all the slots.<br />
<br />
In this case, you're free to get them all. The only choice you have is the order you're going to get them.</div></div><hr />

Except you can get everything unlocked this time. Sure, it'll take a while, but everything will be available to you if you put in the effort. The old system did not have that.</div></div><hr />

These are more like Draenor perks, except you unlock them as you level and progress through end game, rather than unlocking them only while you level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Almost exactly like the talent tree worked while leveling. <br />
<br />
In any case, I have high hopes that we'll get better artifact talents later in development cycle, as these ones are essentially the &quot;1/2/3/4/5% crit chance&quot; talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
polearm is kinda meh...<br />
the one with the wolf head is cool, but not for hunters. :/<br />
<br />
one of them seems like a staff, and the last one looks like some kind of blunt weapon. too thick &quot;blade&quot;. undeewhelming. :(<br />
<br />
<br />
the dagger is just plain awful<br />
doesnt look legendary at all, not even epic. <br />
daggers are really bad choice for artifact weapons imho due to their size, but at least one of the rogue specces must have had it, i know. <br />
but i never imagined that all the dagger designs could be so shitty... :/ <br />
<br />
xmog ftw!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They took away Warlock's ability to water walk as well which I'd argue is more useful. Tell you what, you take water breathing and I'll take your water walking since there are multiple ways to breath underwater but water walking is a consumable that gets burned up from taking 1pt damage.</div></div><hr />
