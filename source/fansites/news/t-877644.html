Blizzard released an official preview of the guild challenges found on test realms (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2225-Guild-Challenges-on-PTR-4.1-Build-13793-Strings-The-Daily-Blink) earlier this week. <br />
In addition to updating Zul’Gurub and Zul’Aman for level-85 players, we're also excited about another patch 4.1 feature: Guild Challenges. Built into the Info panel of the guild user interface, Guild Challenges will be weekly tasks guild groups can tackle for additional guild experience, achievements, and gold.<br />
<br />
This feature has been designed and implemented to be quite simple. At the top of the guild user interface Info pane, a new Guild Challenges section will be displayed and broken into three categories: Dungeons, Raids, and Rated Battlegrounds. Any guild group will qualify for Guild Challenges credit and there is a set number of times each challenge can be completed per week. There’s no need to add a quest to your Quest Log or anything of that nature. Just grab a guild group eligible for any of the challenges and go.<br />
<br />
Completing a Guild Challenge will result in a popup to confirm credit has been awarded, similar to achievement popups (or “toasts”). The participating guild members will then earn experience for their guild. In addition, a gold reward will be deposited directly to the Guild Vault. The gold and experience rewarded varies for each challenge type, but you won’t have to worry about receiving reduced rewards if, say, you happen to be in a guild group that completes a raid or dungeon on normal difficulty. Since there is a limited number of times each challenge type can be completed per week, we want to make sure guilds don’t feel set back if a guild group of level-18 players receives credit for completing Deadmines, versus a level-85 guild group completing Heroic Deadmines. The same applies to normal and Heroic difficulty raid progression. Provided the content is level-appropriate for your guild group, you’ll earn experience and gold for your guild.<br />
<br />
To earn Guild Dungeon Challenge credit, the 5-player party must be composed of at least 3 guild members. Raid and Rated Battleground Challenges require that 8 out of 10 players be guild members, while 20 guild members are required to earn credit for 25-player raids. To earn gold for Guild Challenge rewards, a guild must be level 5 or higher and the participating members must have earned honored reputation with the guild. For example, 3 out of 5 guild members in a 5-player party must be honored to earn gold for the guild. If those three guild members have only reached friendly reputation, they would still receive credit and earn guild experience, but the guild would not receive gold.<br />
<br />
So, let’s say your guild has been regularly hitting the daily experience cap. You might be wondering how beneficial it’d be to do Guild Challenges. Well wonder no more, amigos: Guild Challenges award guild experience above the cap. Think of it like rested experience. The guild experience cap will extend itself relative to the guild experience earned by completing these challenges. It’s a great way to get an extra edge on your guild leveling! Not only that, if your guild reaches the level cap, continuing to partake in Guild Challenges will yield a much more substantial sum of gold deposited directly into the Guild Vault.<br />
<br />
We’re very happy with Guild Challenges and feel that they’re a fun way to continue expanding upon all of the new guild features added in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Your feedback regarding this system is always appreciated, as you can be sure we’ll be looking for ways to beef it up in future patches.<br />

Ensidia is Awesome<br />
Don't blame me for the title, that's what the game said! Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com/) was the first guild in the world to complete the I Can't Hear You Over the Sound of How Awesome I Am (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5313/i-cant-hear-you-over-the-sound-of-how-awesome-i-am/) achievement! Congratulations to them! <br />

Rogers (Canadian ISP) admits throttling World of Warcraft<br />
ArsTechnica (http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/03/oops-major-canadian-isp-admits-throttling-world-of-warcraft.ars) has a very interesting article about how Rogers has been throttling traffic from WoW for the past few weeks. According to the reply from Rogers (pasted below), the problem might not be fixed before June. <br />
<br />
&quot;Our tests have determined that there is a problem with our traffic management equipment that can interfere with World of Warcraft,&quot; said Rogers. &quot;We have been in contact with the game manufacturer and we have been working with our equipment supplier to overcome this problem.<br />
<br />
&quot;We recently introduced a software modification to solve the problems our customers are experiencing with World of Warcraft. However, there have been recent changes to the game, which has created new problems. A second software modification to address these new issues will not be ready until June.&quot;<br />

Word of Glory 20sec cooldown in Patch 4.1<br />
I recently spoke to the devs about this, and their direction on it has not changed. We want Ret to be able to heal. However, if a Ret paladin is healing so often that a 20 second cooldown is a constraint, then that Ret paladin is spending too many GCDs healing. Spending a lot of GCDs on heals isn’t what we want a DPS spec to be doing.<br />
<br />
We’d rather it be a big heal that is used infrequently, than a small heal that is only makes a difference to you if you give a lot of your GCDs to it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/166407/ret-clarification-requested-on-wog-nerf))<br />

Holy Word: Sanctuary<br />
I had a talk with the devs about this very issue yesterday, and they are well aware of this subject, and tend to agree with those of us (one of my mains is a holy priest) who have noticed that Sanctuary could do with a buff.<br />
<br />
There are two things that have to be dealt with here: 1) Holy priest AE healing is pretty decent as-is, and 2) we don’t want Sanctuary to be so similar to Healing Rain.<br />
<br />
Again, the devs agree that a modest buff is a fair solution, although it is hard to know when or by what magnitude such a buff might come along. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/166343/hw-sanctuary))<br />

Unstable Affliction Dispell Penalty<br />
We think the silence from dispelling Unstable Affliction is sufficiently punitive, but the damage may be too low currently - - that it isn’t scary enough to make it a decision to dispel or not.<br />
<br />
In general, it’s not our goal to offer dispel protection for every dot or hot out there, but Unstable Affliction is a spell and mechanic we like and we want to make sure it’s doing its job. Maybe a damage bump would be enough, but in any case it's an ability we're looking at. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/166397/ua-dispel-penalty))</div></div><hr />

Yeah, its putting a damper on the speed - i would guess its because they think its pirate traffic. After all Blizzard uses bittorent to distribute the wow patches - that must be evil, right?<br />

Its a bad idea just to block certain protocols.</div></div><hr />

<br />
wondering the same thing. that's no challenge at all, i was expecting more fun stuff, like making the guild complete a achievement (even if all the members already completed it) or make a harder version of an existing achievement that wouldn't be puggable<br />
<br />
for example, one week we would have &quot;faster than the speed of light guild challenge edition&quot;, complete vault of lights in 4:30 instead of 5 min<br />
or &quot;too hot to handle guild challenge edition&quot;, stacking the debuff to 20 instead of the usual 15<br />
<br />
stuff like that would be real challenges. not &quot;complete 5 dungeons in a week&quot; that they're proposing...</div></div><hr />

They should give death strike (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/49998/death-strike/) a 20cd as well, with maybe a talent on blood to reduce its cd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Judging from previous issues with ISP's it appears that a previous WoW patch made changes to the data transmitted between your client and the servers.<br />
This change resulted in some ISP's recognising that as Peer to Peer or file sharing traffic, which due to automated systems is often on a lower priority or throttled in terms of its potential bandwidth use.<br />
Seperating that out manually from something otherwise very similar which the ISPs feel they have a good reason to throttle has proven problematic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bell's not much better in the big picture, really. They also have limited bandwidth, and probably throttle some connections. Just so happens their throttling doesn't affect WoW specifically.<br />
To all the fellow Canadians who use Rogers/Bell, I recommend you look at the smaller internet companies cropping up. They offer better service (some with unlimited bandwidth, either right out of the box, or for a minuscule increase in price), and the more switching to them, the more the big ones will have to reconsider their practices as they lose more and more customers due to their terrible methods.<br />
<br />
I'm personally using Yak internet, which costs the same baseline as Rogers for 10Mbps, yet with unlimited bandwidth. No longer are my bills changing from 50$ to 120$ due to passing the bandwidth limit with exorbitant pricing for going over the cap. Not even any throttling on P2P that I'm aware of.<br />
Instead of complaining about your ISPs and how it's not fair, take 5 minutes to research alternatives, and then do something about it that will have an actual effect. Rogers/Bell won't change their practices if people keep paying for their ridiculous services. If they start losing a lot of customers to proper competition (and no, Rogers/Bell do not count as competition), they will have to shape up their act.<br />
<br />
For anyone interested, in Ontario, there's Yak ( http://www.yak.ca/high-speed-internet ) and Teksavvy ( http://teksavvy.com/en/res-internet.asp ) that I know of that offer decent services. There's probably more too if you look for them.</div></div><hr />

I had the same issue here in Norway after 4.0 launched. My provider, Nextgentel, was also limiting the P2P traffic on their lines. But its not publicly known.<br />
After i noticed a lot of issues with my gameplay i gave them a call and explained my problem. They did a software upgrade on my router and now im running everything smoothly. Even my P2P download rate are insane... :)<br />

I recently spoke to the devs about this, and their direction on it has not changed. We want Ret to be able to heal. However, if a Ret paladin is healing so often that a 20 second cooldown is a constraint, then that Ret paladin is spending too many GCDs healing. Spending a lot of GCDs on heals isn’t what we want a DPS spec to be doing.<br />
<br />
We’d rather it be a big heal that is used infrequently, than a small heal that is only makes a difference to you if you give a lot of your GCDs to it.<br />

&quot;We don't want a dps specc to be healing most of the time.&quot; - That is a proper reason in my book...I mean..how often have people been complaining how &quot;ZOMGLOLO&quot;overpowered DKs are for example that they can dps, heal and tank in such a way that they can solo &quot;not to recent&quot; raidbosses. - I guess after retris, devs will eventually look into this.<br />

One day it is &quot;fanboi&quot; now it is &quot;Blizzard puppy&quot;. Tiresome. Yes, obviously this game needs the entire playerbase jsut bashing Blizzard.

Class forums are full of complaints all the time and every class is constantly re-evaluated, not least because things that looked good in internal testing didn't work fullscale in game as expected.</div></div><hr />

for example, one week we would have &quot;faster than the speed of light guild challenge edition&quot;, complete vault of lights in 4:30 instead of 5 min<br />
or &quot;too hot to handle guild challenge edition&quot;, stacking the debuff to 20 instead of the usual 15<br />

I recently spoke to the devs about this, and their direction on it has not changed. We want Ret to be able to heal. However, if a Ret paladin is healing so often that a 20 second cooldown is a constraint, then that Ret paladin is spending too many GCDs healing. Spending a lot of GCDs on heals isn’t what we want a DPS spec to be doing.<br />
<br />
We’d rather it be a big heal that is used infrequently, than a small heal that is only makes a difference to you if you give a lot of your GCDs to it.<br />
<br />
Then why implement a Talent like Selfless healer if they dont want to encourage ret to actively heal? Right now Selfless healer and wog spam are what is making Ret viable. WoG on its own is pretty weak, but when the planets align and they get a series of lucky RNG such as divine purpose and eternal glory that it goes from being weak to being OP. Likewise Zealotry + WoG spam was equally OP. With this change and the 60 sec icd to sacred shield, I just cant see how ret can compete after this.</div></div><hr />

They also have limited bandwidth, and probably throttle some connections. Just so happens their throttling doesn't affect WoW specifically.<br />
To all the fellow Canadians who use Rogers/Bell, I recommend you look at the smaller internet companies cropping up. They offer better service (some with unlimited bandwidth, either right out of the box, or for a minuscule increase in price), and the more switching to them, the more the big ones will have to reconsider their practices as they lose more and more customers due to their terrible methods.<br />
<br />
I'm personally using Yak internet, which costs the same baseline as Rogers for 10Mbps, yet with unlimited bandwidth. No longer are my bills changing from 50$ to 120$ due to passing the bandwidth limit with exorbitant pricing for going over the cap. Not even any throttling on P2P that I'm aware of.<br />
Instead of complaining about your ISPs and how it's not fair, take 5 minutes to research alternatives, and then do something about it that will have an actual effect. Rogers/Bell won't change their practices if people keep paying for their ridiculous services. If they start losing a lot of customers to proper competition (and no, Rogers/Bell do not count as competition), they will have to shape up their act.<br />
<br />
For anyone interested, in Ontario, there's Yak ( http://www.yak.ca/high-speed-internet ) and Teksavvy ( http://teksavvy.com/en/res-internet.asp ) that I know of that offer decent services. There's probably more too if you look for them.<br />
<br />
In Canada there are only 2 ISP's don't be fooled, any other ISP in Canada is buying bandwidth from either Rogers or Bell, they are the 2 big players and they are imposing more stuff on Canadians because they control the television networks as well as phone and internet, the caps are in place to prevent people from getting services that allow us to circumvent their high costs for something we hardly use by going with skype and netflicks or similar services. There is a battle going on right now with the CRTC (part of the government that controls aspects and laws on internet phone and television services) they are trying to impose usage based billing, meaning after you go over you cap they could charge up to 4$ a gigabyte infinitely after you go over it just like cell phone data plans. currently Canada is in the top 3 most expensive internet costs in the world.<br />
<br />
On a side note, netflicks also causes a huge slowdown in any online gaming, not because it takes too much bandwidth, but because they purposely throttle it because once again they are the big movers for television and don't want anyone to have affordable movie and television or any other services for that matter. They want to have all the control, and they almost have it.</div></div><hr />

I like the guild challenges, but the money/honored thing is annoying, especially as it works for low levels things as well, this way I can see guild getting annoyed that low level members and alts, who've yet to reach Honored are 'wasting' Challenge Charges by completing groups, as they wont give you the gold reward.<br />
<br />
the reply to the WoG change annoys me as well, for two reasons. 1) what about Prot? you're only talking about Ret PvP, this nerf effects ALOT more than that. 2) if you want it to be a big heal used infrequently, can you buff the ammount it heals for? cause at the moment it's a SMALL heal that at least for Prot HAS to be used every CD to have any kind of noticable effect.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, make death knights completely useless for tanking! What an awesome idea!<br />
<br />
You really have to think about more than solo'ing old raidcontent. Yes, We death knights excel at solo'ing stuff. So? We can make some &quot;quick&quot; gold(it's not even that much) and they're even nerfing gold drops. <br />

I know what you are saying. Bell has plenty of faults, it just seems that at this moment in time they offer better deals. I don't worry about overpaying much because at some point I looked at my average traffic consumption and simply bought extra 80 gig for something like 5$. As for smaller providers - quite a few of my friends have those and they all complain about ridiculously low speed across the board. I just really don't want to experiment and go through the hassle of changing providers until I find one that works.<br />
<br />
By the way, it's quite possible that in near future Bell will limit usage of it's infrastructure for smaller providers - in effect forcing them to charge usage too.</div></div><hr />

At least Rogers had guts to acknowledge there is a problem/throttling issue.

All they can do is warn their own customers of the said provider, but ten again, that would be a reason for the provider to sue Blizzard (bad mouthing etc..)<br />
<br />
Doesnt the ''bad mounthing'' allows Blizzard the same right to sue as it would Rogers to sue Blizzard ? If Blizzard can't say if you play our game don't play with Rogers they are crap...how come Rogers can say if you play Wow f you because you're a p2p hacker and we hate you and your game.<br />

How many Saronite bombs did ensidia use during Sinestra?<br />
<br />
<br />
my guilds Tankadin uses Rogers. this explains his odd Lagspikes..... got a wow customer support guy plus a rogers customer support guy on the phone in a conference call... it was funny listening to the recording of them alternatly blaming each other. :D<br />
<br />
He's looking for a new ISP now, and complaining to the CRTC. they shouldnt be able to packet sniff and throttle your net based on what you are using your internet connection for. thats invasion of privacy, and invasion of implied privacy.<br />
<br />
Bell is already doing it, doing it on purpose, and deliberately doing it. Only reason gives in : peak p2p traffic is between 11pm and 5am...and we throttle all our customers during those hours.</div></div><hr />

They said something about making wow players lag on purpose if they use the p2p launcher thingy. Now they are saying it was an accident and are going to repair it? lol<br />

I wish we could get the full story behind the Rogers thing but it would never happen since it seems like it is being resolved, because you're right.

He's using that spirit wand. Now that's cool as I'm sure even with the spirit it's better than the only other PVE wand Blizz put in this tier. But I find it weird that he reforged the mastery to hit, when he would gain just as much hit reforging out the spirit...which is useless for mages.<br />

<br />
This has been ongoing with Rogers for a few months now... I'm pleased they've finally owned up and accepted responsibility. If they had done this sooner (you know, when customers first informed them of the problem) maybe things would look a little nicer. It's unfortunate that customers have to complain to the CRTC as almost a method of customer service.<br />
<br />
Initially the stance was that it was Blizzard's fault and it was out of their hands... Which was ridiculous because it was only Rogers customers effected and every other ISP that had encountered this issue fixed it pretty quickly because, you know, their customers were unhappy.<br />
<br />
For those of you still stuck with Rogers until June (I'm with you, I'm moving apartments in a few months and didn't see the point in changing ISPs), I would look around for an IP tunneling service. I don't know of any good free ones, but there are some good ones for a small charge that I've had success with. It'll get you locked out of WoW from time to time, but a password reset (takes 5 minutes) is better than constant DCs at the worst of times and random, crippling lag.<br />
<br />
On an unrelated note... I don't think there's a single Rogers service I've had that I've been happy with. I've had problems with their cable, Internet and cellphone service. I haven't used their streaming or home phone services :)</div></div><hr />

I recently spoke to the devs about this, and their direction on it has not changed. We want Ret to be able to heal. However, if a Ret paladin is healing so often that a 20 second cooldown is a constraint, then that Ret paladin is spending too many GCDs healing. Spending a lot of GCDs on heals isn’t what we want a DPS spec to be doing.<br />
<br />
We’d rather it be a big heal that is used infrequently, than a small heal that is only makes a difference to you if you give a lot of your GCDs to it.<br />
<br />
Or... y'know, they could notice that a DPS class is spending a lot of GCDs on heals and say &quot;Why does he need so much healing as opposed to other plate wearing classes? Could it be because balancing around bubble is a terrible idea?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a bad idea just to block certain protocols.<br />
<br />
Obviously, this is a test to see how well throttling can be done, and what the ramifications are. I expect that over the next few years, mmos and torrent sites will have their traffic banned by many if not all of the big time providers. As the computer industry gravitates away from static, go-nowhere pcs, to a dynamic take-it-with-you tablet/phone, this won't be an issue, as mmos will gradually fade away, anyways.</div></div><hr />

I wanted to bring some more clarifications about the issues some of our customers are encountering while playing WoW. <br />
<br />
What we know today is that there is a problem with our traffic management equipment that is inadvertently slowing the game for some customers. While we have fixed some issues with a software modification, new problems have emerged that we expect will be addressed with a second software update in June.<br />
<br />
We believe the problem occurs when P2P is running while simultaneously playing the game. If you are experiencing problems we suggest you turn off the peer to peer setting within the WoW game and ensure no other P2P file sharing applications are running while playing WoW. WoW does use P2P for software updates, but with this setting changed you should continue to automatically receive software updates through other methods.<br />
<br />
This is only a temporary solution. We continue to work closely with the game manufacturer and our equipment supplier to help resolve this issue as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Finally, if any of you has issues with Rogers, you can reach me directly on Twitter - RogersElise - or via PM on this board and I'll see if I can help.</div></div><hr />

It's cute how Rogers has scripting to post on various forums and in comments for this issue. Too bad that it, once again, is full of lies. Ressy has posted the followup complaint, but here's the gist:<br />
Rogers DPI isn't just targeting connections that utilize P2P, but seemingly targeting random people and throttling them. Not even just on WoW, but on many other games and applications.<br />
Rogers took months to even address the issue (a PR guy was the first to say something about it, but everyone else in the entire company denied it for months afterwards). After again months of begging from various users and &quot;the game manufacturer&quot;, Rogers finally decided to contact them, less than a week before the response from the initial complaint was required.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd tell Rogers employees where to shove it, but I'm sure it's already packed full at this point.</div></div><hr />

interesting how you would post on mmo champion, the geek meca of all &amp; everything WoW.<br />
<br />
I am a customer of rogers, i called &amp; made complaints of my service not working while i would torrent files ( while playing wow ). I was not out right laughed at but since teir 1 support at rogers could never help me, i was helpless with no where to go. On march 22 i was pleased to see the article &amp; letter rogers wrote. On march 25 i cancelled my service with rogers. I have switched my VOIP to primus, 29.99$ + tax includes unlimited calling in north america, includes 16 calling features. On april 25'th m y internet access with Teksavvy will commence. <br />
<br />
After Rogers detected a problem affecting the game world of WoW, due to its client base multi million users, you would think they would put an instant stop on their IMTP until a fix was found but that is not the case. <br />
<br />
currently paying rogers 69.99$ + tax + 7$ for modem a month and teksavvy is giving me 15 mbps with 300 gig download 1 mbps upload for 42$ + tax.<br />
<br />
I am in london ontario. Now will rogers put a stop to this once and for all or do i have to continue to move all the remaining services i had with rogers? All i have left is my cell phone Blackberry 9700 &amp; digital cable tv, i am prepared to pay all the cancellation charges needed to never deal with rogers again until this issue is taken care of. Bell has already spoken to me about switching over, i was offered a free HDMI pvr box if i switch, as long as i keep their service for a year. <br />
<br />
Going from 5 services with rogers to 0 services with rogers, we are talking thousands of $ per year just from me alone! that rogers will loose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, our big providers are notorious for making bad decisions that take years to fix. Most likely, if they see too many people switching to smaller providers - they will simply throttle those. Remember, all cooper phone wires in your walls are pretty much owned by Bell, any small company has to rent them on Bell's terms. Same goes with cable lines and Rogers.</div></div><hr />

My own opinion to ISP would be...you provide the service we pay for...everything else is not your business. Now if Rogers and friends want to trottle us to send us a message which says : We do not like P2P, then pay a few hundred billions in lawsuits, bribe a judge so he can declare P2P is illegal and we all can switch back to a 9.95 per month basic internet service which will be more than enough with current infrastructure to do most of things we do on the internet...but then that makes you lose another bunch of billions of green bills...so chose your way or stop being stupid and taking your customers for dumbs.</div></div><hr />

P2P is not illegal, but the majority of traffic consists of pirated software, games, music, etc. In other words, an ISP has to consider the scope of its possible liability given the situation.<br />
<br />
Not only that, consider this: P2P is known to be an extreme bandwidth hog at times. How would a paying customer such as yourself feel if you were not getting what you paid for because some other person was basically downloading the Internet? You might be tempted to say, &quot;build more infrastructure&quot;, but it's not that simple. The government can get away with doing stuff that doesn't pencil out financially, but any business that wants to stay in business can't. (ie. location, market size, regulations, and so on)</div></div><hr />
