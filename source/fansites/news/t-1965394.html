My prayers (read: bitching and moaning) have been answered. BM getting an option to bring it more in line with the current one powerful pet style, is fine, and I'll definitely be interested to see what it is and how it works. But with MM becoming a hybrid of classic MM and SV AND now being able to keep a pet, I'm ecstatic. SV has always been my favorite spec and I've been distraught about losing it. All I want in life is for my pet to hold aggro so I can proc Lock and Load all day. Now I'll be able to do it in MM. It's kind of poetic for me. When I maxed out my first toon and started to get into raiding such that I actually needed to examine dps levels, it was 3.3 and MM was the only option. Now it's coming full circle for me. MMaMMa, I'm coming home.</div></div><hr />

Aw, give Anduin some credit. I'm a diehard member of the Horde, and even I can give Anduin the respect he deserves. If he was ever at all a crybaby, it was because he was just that, a baby. When we first met him, he was, what, 6? Maybe 10? He was still just a little kid.<br />
<br />
But over the years, he's dealt with all sorts of stuff and rose to the challange every time. He was a diplomat to Ironforge in his teens and was in the city during the Darkiron uprising and the almost-war that resulted in the Council of Three Hammers. He managed to escape and bring back reinforcements, befriending Baine Bloodhoof in the meantime. He's been trained by some of the Alliance's best. Learning physical skills from his father, magic from Aunt Jaina, the light from Velen. He saved his father from an attack by the Twilight's Hammer right in Stormwind and together they fought them off. He's matched wits with Wrathion (Wrathuin OTP!). He stood up to Garrosh and foiled his plans to use the Divine Bell (and survived Garrosh crushing him with said bell). And in War Crimes he was right in the middle of the fighting in the climax of the book.<br />
<br />
So come on, the kid's got chops.</div></div><hr />

It isn't actually that bad, the whole Battlecry no rage thing would cause massive amount of rage capping and waste. Whirlwind is affected by a bunch of traits and talents meaning it will be used often and will give more steady rage income outside of Battle Cry and less wastage whilst in Battle Cry.</div></div><hr />

For pve yeah, but seems sort of pointless for pvp</div></div><hr />

I think there are enough Talents in both the PvP and PvE trees to keep Rage up, without having 100% rage and 100% crit at the same time.</div></div><hr />

It's because they started working on Legion immediately after WoD's release and didn't get the feedback that people hated garrisons in time. They know now but it's too late to change it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they knew like maybe 3 weeks into WoD's launch that Garrisons sucked. They're just doing it because they can. Get used to Garrisons, you've enabled Blizzard to the point where they can do anything and get away with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
or they could throw out that terrible WoD system and actually give us something engaging to do. It's lazy. They're carrying over one of the main concerns with WoD just to have something there. Create something new..<br />
<br />
<br />
It's not like there's two options (send followers/do mission yourself) if you simply &quot;don't do it&quot; you miss out on whatever they're rewarding. that's not a good suggestion.</div></div><hr />
