GC's latest blog: Active Mitigation Playstyle<br />
Right now it's tough for DK tanks because they're the only ones on anything resembling an active mitigation model. The one active mitigation guy is going to look like he's working harder than the passive mitigation guys because, in a lot of ways, he is. If all tanks had worked this way from the start, it would be the norm, and nobody would be worried about jumping onto that model.<br />
<br />
We've already established that threat isn't making for very compelling encounter design, and removing it offers us the ability to get creative with some of the mechanics that we're using; both in encounter and class design. In a world with no threat management, and no active mitigation, that doesn't leave a lot for tanks to do though. We think that making tanking more active, and focusing that activity around mitigation (which feels immediately useful) will generate some very rewarding gameplay. We want the act of tanking to be engaging, interesting and fun. We think the path forward will offer more of that for all the tanking classes.<br />
<br />
Also, I've seen a number of references to making tanking easier in this thread and elsewhere. &quot;Easier&quot; isn't really the goal. The goal is to discard a mechanic which we don't think is working particularly well anymore, and replace it with something more focused and interesting. Doing so should also have the effect of allowing tanks who aren't as geared still do their job when grouped with players who outgear (or even outlevel them a bit). They'll still be responsible for doing a good job, but their absolute ability to hold the attention of the boss won't be a factor; their ability to play well and mitigate damage will be.<br />
<br />
We're aware of player concerns about Blood tanking, and we'll work to ensure that Blood tanking will continue to be viable and effective into the future. On that note, we're interested in addressing some of the concerns that have been expressed about the spec (potentially as soon as the next major patch), though we want to accomplish that goal without sacrificing what sets the spec apart and makes it interesting.

But the new model is when things may get fun, a change like that may not be enough to get me back playing but its in the right direction. Keep changing up some of the shittier parts of the trinity system, and perhaps the trinity system in WoW would be enjoyable enough to bear, instead of just waiting for all the next gen MMOs. Honestly if you can't imagine it being done right, you lack imagination, yes Blizzard could screw up, but you can say they change of threat from WotLK to Cata was a screw up up too, or before they made they change if u happened to like it dismissed as garbage before you have even seen it.</div></div><hr />

Decent tanks never had an issue holding aggro, even in early cata. The problem comes when tanks want to progress. You could be the best possible class for a tank (paladin) with decent gear and a good rep while trying to app to a decent guild, you'd have a very very hard time finding a guild that would take you. The problem is tanks just don't scale compared to dps. 1 for 5 mans, 2 for 10 mans, maybe 3 for 25 mans. Now, if this actually scaled correctly, 25 man content would need 5 tanks to maintain a good ratio (5 tanks, 15 dps, and 5 healers but it doesn't work that way) Most guilds are doing 25 man content because it's easier and gives more loot. They already have their 3 tanks setup. Tanks have no place in pvp as well, only pve. So, once a tank finishes his 5 man grind, where does he go? On the shelf.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simca</div><div class="date">2011-08-17, 04:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The threat change right now is dumb by itself (since threat is an absolute joke if you know what the taunt button is and how to use it quickly before the attack even hits the player when they pull threat).It'll be nice in heroic randoms I guess but I'd rather not see tanks with an absolutely awful rotation or ones only hitting buttons every 3 seconds due to terrible reflexes do okay on threat.After the active migitation change I'll be totally happy with it, but right now it's pretty dumb by itself. If you're struggling with threat atm, learn to taunt (seriously, I can keep threat off the best DPS with taunts as a fresh 85 - maybe not as a bear druid but every other class).</div></div><hr />

Either way is fine by me. The problem is that the majority of the players are lazy-asses, that associate being DPS to get it easy. I have 3 Tanks, and I'm struggling to play ONE, because I see bad Damage dealers not CCing, breaking CC, using full PvP gear on Zandalari, doing less damage than myself, even with that Vengeance nerf. General Knowledge that DPS is the easy path to go must be eliminated, because it's not anymore. Damage Dealers responsibilities are increasing with each change. This change in Threat isn't eliminating the responsibilities, it's shifting to damage dealers, and they must acknowledge they have to know they classes, and look for references and news outside the game to improve themselves.</div></div><hr />

I call bollocks on this. He was already extremely easy it took my guild all of around 8 wipes to down him. And none of us had any heroic gear and we are by no means amazing(40+ wipes on alysrazor to kill her). This is going to make our progression nights go faster now I guess.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't be easier to just make changes to do something like &quot;X ability's damage has been reduced by 5% on other players&quot; if its a PvP change and &quot;X ability's damage has been reduced by 5% in instances&quot; for PvE (yes raids are considered instances)</div></div><hr />

If the vengeance is nerfed in the sense I realize it being nerf, then thats further going to hurt DK tanks.<br />

If the nerf on Rhyolith is valid for heroic aswell, then it will be easier for people that does not have required compositions, we were stuck at 2-8 armor stacks for previous weeks :(<br />

you didn't read the rest of what blizzard actually said about it. this is step one in an overhaul to the tanking system. they're going to make it more engaging as far as mitigation goes. the fun part of tanking will be timing your cd's and staying alive. not mashing buttons trying to hold threat.

If you're struggling with threat atm, learn to taunt (seriously, I can keep threat off the best DPS with taunts as a fresh 85 - maybe not as a bear druid but every other class).<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how many times you taunt if a class or spec can build threat faster than you can unless you like putting taunt on DR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He is easy if the RNG volcanos don't fuck you up and the turn speed after stomp vs. turn speed without stomping which all in all makes the encounter kind of retarded. But yes if all goes according to plan, he is the easiest boss around, still way to random. <br />
<br />
They should also take a look a seeds on Domo, which are also kind of bs. If you're a healer and you get a short seed, your raid is fine, if you get a seed on a long timer, your raid could be fine, but could also be dead.<br />

All this random stuff makes some bosses less and less enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure how you interpreted the change as &quot;Occu'thar is now guaranteed to drop at least one PvE item.&quot;. Nor how another poster read it as &quot;Occu'thar will now drop more items.&quot;. It simply says his loot table includes more PvE items.</div></div><hr />

It's ironic they're changing threat for tanks because it's not the issue behind the lack of tanks at all. Decent tanks never had an issue holding aggro, even in early cata. The problem comes when tanks want to progress. You could be the best possible class for a tank (paladin) with decent gear and a good rep while trying to app to a decent guild, you'd have a very very hard time finding a guild that would take you. The problem is tanks just don't scale compared to dps. 1 for 5 mans, 2 for 10 mans, maybe 3 for 25 mans. Now, if this actually scaled correctly, 25 man content would need 5 tanks to maintain a good ratio (5 tanks, 15 dps, and 5 healers but it doesn't work that way) Most guilds are doing 25 man content because it's easier and gives more loot. They already have their 3 tanks setup. Tanks have no place in pvp as well, only pve. So, once a tank finishes his 5 man grind, where does he go? On the shelf.<br />
<br />
No place in pvp? LOL.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TBK1001</div><div class="date">2011-08-17, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizz is so ridiculous. This is from a 2010 Blue Post regarding their Rage goal for Cataclysm: &quot;Our goal is for each character's Rage to not be always high or always low, but rather a resource that needs to be managed properly by the player.&quot; (http://www.curse.com/articles/wow-en-news/713399.aspx) Now, of course, it's &quot;We expect the community to gradually stop using threat-tracking mods as players realize they don’t need them.&quot; <br />
<br />
They begin the Watercoool Rage post with &quot;One of the fun things about working on an MMO is that the game design will evolve over time, and you have the opportunity to make changes to reflect those design shifts.&quot; Complete smoke and mirrors, typical Blizz gibberish and obfuscation. Properly translated, it should read &quot;It's all organic, we aren't backtracking, or cleaning up our own mess, these changes have nothing to do with our own incompetence.&quot; <br />
<br />
Flip-flops like this, with Blizz not even bothering to admit and apologize that they got it completely wrong, are the primary reason I left WoW months ago. I continue to check up on it though, because now, rather then being frustrated by Blizzard's idiotic development decisions and arrogance, I can just laugh at them. <br />
<br />
The thing is, given Blizz's history over the last couple of years, I have absolutely no confidence that this decision will be permanent in any sense. It wouldn't surprise me one bit to see them flip-flop back in six months, and then flip again down the road. Blizzard would call that 'evolution'. Me, I call it the byproduct of lousy decision-making.</div></div><hr />

Ok with the changes for heroic since there wasn't any threat increase for the 1 tank on Majordomo HC while dps gets 100% dps increase, it just made sense to do this. As for making Baleroc allways use inferno blade first? don't see how this could be a major issue unless the tank didn't get 260k+ before the first blade, haven't run into this issue myself so. Also i hope the ryolith changes are for normal since it's already quite simple once you know how to actually do the fight correct on heroic.</div></div><hr />

People do more damage over the course of the fight the longer they don't take damage. Which means the tank doesn't benefit. This ensures DPS won't accidentally out-threat the tank.</div></div><hr />

On the Golden Platter is a plate containing eggs, hash browns, lightly buttered toast... and a Newspaper.<br />
<br />
Nef slowly eats his eggs... <br />
<br />
&quot;So, anything interesting going on today Krix?&quot;<br />
<br />
Krixix shifts uncomfortably...<br />
<br />
&quot;...n...nothing much m'lord Nefarian.&quot;<br />
<br />
Nefarian eyes him suspiciously<br />
<br />
&quot;Is that so Krix? You seem... troubled...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It's nothing m'lord...&quot; Krix stammers &quot;...may I go back to my duties?&quot;<br />
<br />
Nefarian again eyes him suspiciously<br />
<br />
&quot;Very well... be gone from my sight&quot;.<br />
<br />
Relieved... Kirixix says &quot;Thank you!&quot; and rushes off.<br />
<br />
Out the Door Kirixix met by Broodlord Lashslayer<br />
<br />
&quot;Has he found out yet?&quot; the Broodlord whispers<br />
<br />
Kirixix says &quot;Not yet... I just managed to get out before!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Good call&quot; Broodlord stammers on &quot;Lets get moving before he finds out...&quot;<br />
<br />
Back in the throne room, Nefarian finishes his breakfast and is quietly sipping his cup of joe<br />
<br />
He reaches down and picks up the newspaper<br />
<br />
&quot;Well then&quot; Says Nef &quot;What's in today's news...&quot;<br />
<br />
As he reads the paper, he takes another sip of his coffee...<br />
<br />
...he gets halfway through when he spits out the entire contents all over the throne room.<br />
<br />
&quot;WHAAAAAAT!?!!&quot; he shouts, looking back at what he read. &quot;This cant be! Does that mean...&quot;<br />
<br />
A sound that is similar to thunder is heard across the searing gorge.<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; Nefarian says, as he drops the paper and slowly walks to the edge of his balcony<br />
<br />
Nefarian stares across the landscape in utter disbelief<br />
<br />
&quot;No...&quot; he utters<br />
<br />
Horses thundering across the ground<br />
<br />
&quot;....No...&quot; he utters again...<br />
<br />
The skies blackened with winged creatures...<br />
<br />
&quot;....Nononono....!!!&quot; he panics<br />
<br />
The glint of a thousand tiny daggers catches the sun's rays<br />
<br />
&quot;....NooooOOOOOOOO!!!&quot; he finally screams, throwing his fists up in the air<br />
<br />
In his view, we see a vast stampede. Armed with sharpened daggers and wills of steel - an ocean of Rogues descends upon Blackwing Lair.<br />
<br />
<br />
Forget about the Hour of Twilight...<br />
<br />
...for the Hour of Bloodfang Rogues has begun.</div></div><hr />

Tanks are the only type that often have the sole role of positioning. They still have rotations. They still have cooldowns (for both utility and mitigation). The positioning aspect still makes their work more involved than DPS and now tied with healers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To Clarify *Grab-Bag* Means Shared Loot Tables. Meaning on HC Shared Loot can Now contain a Crystal<br />
<br />
So basically, getting a Crystallized Fire in order to trade up an eligible item will be slightly easier to obtain.<br />

I call bollocks on this. He was already extremely easy it took my guild all of around 8 wipes to down him. And none of us had any heroic gear and we are by no means amazing(40+ wipes on alysrazor to kill her). This is going to make our progression nights go faster now I guess.<br />
Easy is relative. I know it took my guild dozens of wipes -- including bugged attempts -- before my fellow guildies were finally able to down him on 10-man on Sunday. If we can manage to get Rhyolith and Baelroc on farm, we'll be looking towards spending a lot of time on the birdie next. /wrist</div></div><hr />

With your average raiding guild (that has no heroic T11 gear, some MF items, and/or T1/T2 heroics stuff), Rhyolith was a lot harder than he ought to have been, particularly on 10-man.<br />
<br />
We did an alt run to 10man with some ridiculous bad alts (rogue with 333ilvl mainhand) and had absolutely no problems on this boss. Actually officer driving Ryolith found it way easier to do than on 25man.</div></div><hr />
