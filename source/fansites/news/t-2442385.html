Hello World of Warcraft community! With BlizzCon 2018 getting closer every day, we wanted to give you an update on what you’ll be experiencing at BlizzCon around WoW Classic. We’ve been hard at work on bringing the original Azeroth back to life, and we’re excited that you’ll be able to get your hands on the demo we’re creating for the show—both at BlizzCon and at home with the Virtual Ticket.<br />
<br />
What to Expect<br />
From the beginning of this project, the team’s mission has been to be as faithful as possible to World of Warcraft as it existed back in 2005 and 2006, before Cataclysm altered the world as we knew it—and we wanted to make sure the demo we built for the show was a clear reflection of that. The focus of the demo is on outdoor questing, and we’ve selected two iconic zones that most original WoW players will no doubt be familiar with—Barrens for the Horde and Westfall for the Alliance—so you can step back in time and experience these zones as they were originally designed. You’ll be able to search for Mankrik’s wife, curse at Ornery Plainstriders for not having beaks, and make a group to kill Defias Pillagers in Moonbrook. You might even get to improvise a new rotation against the Harvest Golems in Farmer Saldean’s farm, since in this era, mechanical creatures may be immune to some of your abilities. We brought all of that back, and we’re as excited about it as you are.<br />
<br />
Because it’s a demo, there’ll will be some limitations on the content: the Deadmines and Wailing Caverns dungeons won’t be available, the only PvP will be dueling, and you won’t be able to visit zones other than Westfall and the Barrens. We also typically limit the time our BlizzCon attendees can play a demo, and that will be the case for BlizzCon WoW Classic Demo players at home. In order to maximize the number of people who can try out the demo, initially you’ll be logged off after playing for a certain amount of time to give somebody else a turn. We haven’t determined exactly how long this time limit will be yet, but we’re also planning some flexibility, so if we’re able to relax the restriction and still give everyone who wants to play a great experience, then we’ll do that. If you do find your session has ended before you’ve done everything you wanted to, don’t worry—your character will be there when you get back in for your next session, and all your progress will be saved.<br />
<br />
You’ll start the demo at level 15. While we know that starting at level 1 holds a lot of nostalgia, you’re also limited in what you can do when you’re first starting out. Given the time constraints of a BlizzCon demo, we wanted to give players some freedom to explore and experiment with core systems like talents or professions, which are unavailable at level 1. We also wanted you to be able to get a good sense of the original class played. At Level 15, warriors have Defensive Stance, priests have Psychic Scream, hunters have their pet, and so on—so at this level you really start to feel like your class has some of the key tools that make the class distinct. Additionally, all characters will be capped at Level 19. But you can create multiple characters, so you can try out as many different classes and races as you’d like!<br />
<br />
What’s “New”<br />
As we mentioned in our original Dev Watercooler blog we posted in June, we’re building WoW Classic on the foundation of our modern code base. That means you’ll be able to download the demo through the Blizzard Battle.net desktop app and use Battle.net chat integration in-game to ask your friend to come check out the Barrens with you. You’ll also find there’s improved support for widescreen monitors—so instead of the world looking stretched and distorted in widescreen, it’ll look like it did on your old 4:3 monitor. Only bigger!<br />
<br />
All of the current game’s tools that help ensure World of Warcraft is a welcoming and fair environment, such as right-click player reporting, will also be in the BlizzCon WoW Classic Demo. Cheats, bots, and other exploitive behavior will also not be allowed, and the modern engine no longer permits some behaviors that could be used to get out of bounds. Support for 32-bit clients has also been removed. One of our core values is “Play nice; play fair,” and we want to do everything we can to ensure a few bad apples don’t ruin the experience for others.<br />
<br />
You’ll also find that post-launch accessibility options such as colorblind mode are in the demo—though as we were working on it, we realized some words and images used in the current Accessibility panel come from the modern game. So we replaced the modern icons with some classic icons, and removed the term “Heirloom” since it doesn’t appear anywhere else in WoW Classic. It’s important to us that in situations like this we blend the old and the new in such a way that it still looks and feels like the game you remember.<br />
<br />
See You in November!<br />
We’re really excited about the BlizzCon WoW Classic Demo, and hope you are too! But we definitely don’t want to send the message that we’re done, because we’re not. There’s still lots of work left do, and the BlizzCon demo is an important step in the process of bringing the original WoW back to life as authentically as we can. This is a great chance for you to see the direction we’re heading and give us some early feedback, so be sure to leave your thoughts in the Classic section of the WoW forums.<br />
<br />
Thanks for playing, and we’ll see you in Azeroth!</div></div><hr />

What people like you seems to ignore, is that majority of people who are really excited with classic already play on private servers since many years. They know exactly what classic is. So can repeat this all the time there's no big surprise for them.</div></div><hr />

They have been saying this forever, it has to be on the new client, the old client was a mismatched pile of tangled web, and if you really wanted it on the old client you would be waiting atleast another year or 2.<br />
there will be no gameplay difference between the two, other then it running BETTER because of the optimization.<br />
I think you just want to invent reasons as to why you are too cheap to pay for something and rather pirate the game.</div></div><hr />

Just those 3 citations already tell me that Vanilla will not be Vanilla as it was back in the day. I'm kinda starting to look at it now like some sort of &quot;remastered Vanilla&quot;.<br />
<br />
1. i dont want you near classic if you enjoy exploits and want them in the game.<br />
2. yeah... as faithful as possible how is that a bad thing wtf?<br />
3. yeah it will add stuff that is REQUIRED on new computers, and these days, colorblind mode, better option screen, more screen resolution options, more graphics choices<br />
They have literally said they WILL NOT be touching the gameplay, and simply bringing vanilla wow into the 21st century</div></div><hr />

I've seen so many posts with people extremely upset that vanilla servers are even a thing. Seriously, take a deep breath, exhale slowly, and then take your mouse up to the top right hand corner, and hit that &quot;X&quot;. You'll feel much better if you stop wasting your time venting angrily onto the internet. People like things you don't. It's a fact of life. Stop stressing out over something that doesn't affect you in anyway. Blizzard has their own team working on this, so current WoW doesn't have a single resource pulled off for this project.</div></div><hr />

Private servers are used by probably no more than a total of 10,000 people worldwide, and are run by volunteers.<br />

That's a far different thing than Blizzard getting involved and investing a significant amount of time and money into the experience. You need employees, and labor, and investment, and PROFIT, to keep a game going.<br />

Sure, but back then there were keyloggers on blizzards forums and besides, not having to type your password is reason enough to want battle.net implementation, literally no downside to it.

Again back then a lot fo it was simply people doing things they shouldnt have been doing, as for logger in addons, if its a executable in an addon you would be a moron to run it blindly or at all since addons dont need or use executables, the rest is just people blindly clicking links before making sure it was safe.<br />
<br />
I played back then and to this day have never had these keyloggers so many people got, why, because im careful with things that matter to me, like my account, passwords, email account and such.<br />
<br />
People wanted the classic experience and here we are getting a curated version of it with only the parts Blizzard wants you to experience. I would prefer people got to experience it all over again just how it was so they could see how awful it was dealing with all the bad shit just to play the good shit.<br />
<br />
But w/e enjoy your curated Blizzard version of classic, just remember its not classic and never actually will be, its nothing more than a watered down version of it with all your QOL improvements yet its missing all the stuff that made classic what it was and was part of the overall experience of playing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played back then and to this day have never had these keyloggers so many people got, why, because im careful with things that matter to me, like my account, passwords, email account and such.<br />
<br />
People wanted the classic experience and here we are getting a curated version of it with only the parts Blizzard wants you to experience. I would prefer people got to experience it all over again just how it was so they could see how awful it was dealing with all the bad shit just to play the good shit.<br />
<br />
But w/e enjoy your curated Blizzard version of classic, just remember its not classic and never actually will be.<br />
<br />
So you actually want the old launcher? Was the highlight of vanilla for you typing in your password multiple times a day? I don't really care about that, I'll play the game just to remember what it was like, which I'm sure won't be different in any meaningful way.</div></div><hr />

So you hate people wanting classis sooo much that you are down to make up your own facts as you go? People are running around in T3 these days and they are noticable, you may not even know it's T3 but you see it and you wonder what that is. Judgment set was also classic - one of the most iconic sets. Weapons like Ashkandi are some of the most sought after and were even redone for later expansions to make it more up to speed. <br />

<br />
They aren't even fixing a bug. They updated their engine to disable wall juming long ago, so they'd likely have to code the wall jumping back in, but because it was a bug and not a feature, that'd be incredibly hard to do as it wasn't intentional in the first place and was likely a weird collision interaction in the engine. <br />
<br />
I just wanted to make that distinction, because saying they fixed it makes it sound like it was intentional. They didn't intentionally fix this bug, it was fixed in the engine long ago.</div></div><hr />

Walljumping was fun, but it was minor part of experience. Best part was being able to play a scrub that NPCs sent to do minor errands, world being dangerous and players helping each other all the time. Walljumping was often used to annoy other players, like holding flag in WSG preventing anyone from capping, so I'm not disappointed that it will be gone.<br />
<br />
As for zones, another good thing about vanilla was that factions weren't balanced in every way. In modern WoW when factions get different zones they are mirrors of each other. Both Barrens and Westfall are iconic Classic zones. As alliance player I don't see horde favouritism.</div></div><hr />

It would've been better to just start the experience at level 1 with Elwynn Forest (which naturally dovetails into Westfall) and Durotar. I get their reasoning for wanting to give people a peek of more systems, but I don't think it's the right call.

It's the demo. The actual release won't start players at level 15. The point is to get players into the game and experience the zone/feel. Not focus on bonking peons and looting apples for the majority of the demo.</div></div><hr />

But there aren't many places to go in those zones. With many players competing over every wolf/boar it would be annoying. Higher level zones provide more choices, giving players chance to actually play rather than wait in queue. We'll get to experience low level zones queue when Classic goes live.</div></div><hr />

They have only developed this demo so far and it is all they ever plan on developing. They will claim this demo got horrible reviews and participation and that there isn't enough interest to continue developing classic wow. It will then get shuttered.<br />
<br />
;)<br />
<br />
I actually think one of the reasons why Classic is coming now and BFA is seeing a lot of backlash due to some bad choices on Blizz's part is because they are trying to reduce participation in Retail to replace it with a Diablo MMO that will get announced next Blizzcon instead of the usual WoW Expansion.<br />
Project Titan was supposed to replace WoW, which was initially meant for 2016, it died and became OW. Legion seemed like a proper send off to WoW, but they had to scramble and make another expansion, hence BFA which (while I don't think it's bad) the story feels disjointed.</div></div><hr />

That was never going to happen and you're naive if you thought it would. It has to be made compatible with their modern account, billing, and distro infrastructure. The Battle.net launcher doesn't even use the same filetypes anymore, they switched from mpq to casc storage years ago.<br />

It'll likely be a stand-alone game separate from current WoW. Also, the achievement didn't even exist until well into BC, so there likely won't be anything of that nature in the revamped classic.</div></div><hr />

Afterall this isnt being built for me, its being built for all the people who joined in TBC and onwards, they wont ever get to experience Classic as it was from release to 1.12 and that makes me happy as thoes memories and experiences will remain untainted by this abomination.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBQH, despite not caring about Classic, I have to say that this is unlikely to happen. Even back in the day when Classic was current, there's PSes, they're utterly broken, practically nothing worked, just a literal shell of the game, and yet people still played on those. Today they're in a much and much better state, so it's fairly obvious that a big chunk of PS players will stay on those.<br />
<br />
And it's nigh impossible to hunt down all PSes, moreover, Blizz can't do much against open-source projects like mangos and whatnot.</div></div><hr />

That’s not how businesses operate. Making a game bad to encourage players to play their newer game? Doesn’t work like that. I for one have zero interest in a diablo mmo. If I quit because I don’t like bfa, blizzard loses a customer that has literally spent thousands of dollars on this game. <br />
<br />
The story in bfa feels disjointed because they split up its presentation between different media formats. And what they did present is just poorly written anyway. (From my Alliance perception.) If I didn’t have friends playing, I would have all ready quit over the story alone. <br />

<br />
The story in bfa feels disjointed because they split up its presentation between different media formats. And what they did present is just poorly written anyway. (From my Alliance perception.) If I didn’t have friends playing, I would have all ready quit over the story alone. <br />
<br />
At blizzcon, I hope someone asks the devs them why the Alliance are in Uldir just to stump them.<br />
<br />
I still dont get why the Alliance are in Uldir, nothing in the game would even suggest the Alliance should have had any reason to be there, Alliance should have gotten their own raid in Stormsong against the Stormsages and the Corrupt King.</div></div><hr />

Project Titan was supposed to replace WoW, which was initially meant for 2016, it died and became OW. Legion seemed like a proper send off to WoW, but they had to scramble and make another expansion, hence BFA which (while I don't think it's bad) the story feels disjointed.<br />

The only flaw I can see in this is how would the Diablo MMO be any different or better?<br />

You're not going to transplant the WoW playerbase into Diablo. The standard is too high and the fantasy would be less light-hearted. Diablo is basically a hellscape world with a lot of throwaway lore, most of it dealing with how bad guys became bad guys.<br />

Simply was never an option, and Blizzard would be pretty dumb to bring in the old code even if they could. The Vanilla code was so unstable the next two expanasion had to be devoped in a way that they wouldn't touch it. Refactoring propely documented code is a huge task (Why cataclysm is by far their largest expansion), and from all the developers I've read who have worked on Vanilla WOW was that it was thrown together like a last minute Homework project.</div></div><hr />

Lol, except for very few instances, like in wsg. Wall jumping is not hurtig anyone, it is literally creating fun for a ton of players.

It's the same kinda demo as what the people on the floor are going to be playing so I'm pretty sure it'll be a lot less than 2 hours.

It's not a mystery why the Alliance are in Uldir.

It's one of the integral parts of Classic WoW's sense of exploration. Being able to see the corpse of Archimonde in Hyjal after defeating him years prior in Warcraft 3 was one of the greatest WoW moments for me. Dancing Troll Village, Ironforge Airport, Greymane Wall, Caverns of Time, Secret Deadmines, under Stormwind, on top of Orgrimmar, etc., the list rolls on with many interesting areas that were there to experience. All potential players are truly losing out big time if this is the intended course.<br />
<br />
Another problem I foresee if they do not allow mobs to be kited. Some classes such as Hunter and Mage are kiting classes at their cores. If mobs are tethered to their spots like BFA, this will not be anywhere near an authentic Classic WoW. <br />
<br />
These 2 changes, coupled with any other alterations, will make or break Classic WoW.<br />
<br />
And to anyone saying &quot;good riddance&quot; to Wall-jumping. You have ousted yourself. I'd wager 99% of the people against it were not even there to have an opinion on it, or were so bad at it that they couldn't even get on top of the water fountain in Stormwind.

Yes, and that was fine. For 2008. Tastes change over time. Audiences become more sophisticated. If you were launching vanilla WoW today it wouldn't go anywhere... the market has changed, people are used to certain things (like dungeon finders and transmog) that we take for granted these days. The problem is that everyone looking forward to Classic WoW also has to contend with the fact that this has to be SELF-SUSTAINING as a product for Blizzard to want to keep investing money in its infrastructure, and most people who try it (not all, but most) are going to find the things that they took for granted, instead nowhere to be found.<br />
<br />
I mean, honestly, just wait until you have to get 40 people attuned to Molten Core again... yeah, have fun with that. ;) (Wildstar died because a lot of people left when they realized that the raid design was just like vanilla WoW: large groups and attunements and metric tons of grinding.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The work for a Classic version was never the design. The devs stated pretty clearly that the issue was recreating the databases. The entire game runs on databases, from spell power, to stats, to what's in your bags, to what loot drops off a mob. And, the structure of the data from back then doesn't work anymore, and they need to import it into modern DB software - if they have the numbers from that era of the game, they've said many times, they just change the databases with updates and tweaks, and they didn't back everything up. Again, this is stuff the actual devs have spoken about. (And, no, you can't get a 14 year old copy of the database software, they don't sell it or support it.) <br />
<br />
I won't even begin to guess how close they are to release, but to hand wave it off as &quot;Not much left to do&quot; is wishful thinking on your part.</div></div><hr />

Those are differences. My point would be how would it be as popular as WoW currently is. You're not going to be able to transplant the playerbases. Unless their goal is to make an initial profit from Diablo and reduce the WoW subs to a point to justify finally sunsetting the product, there's no point in creating a competing MMO.<br />
<br />
Unless we're looknig at a deep fundamental change like B2P instead of sub with more grinding and lootboxes ala Korean MMOs. Something the WoW playerbase wouldn't and current isn't falling for, but a new game might accept.</div></div><hr />

They have only developed this demo so far and it is all they ever plan on developing. They will claim this demo got horrible reviews and participation and that there isn't enough interest to continue developing classic wow. It will then get shuttered.<br />

Tastes change over time. Audiences become more sophisticated. If you were launching vanilla WoW today it wouldn't go anywhere... the market has changed, people are used to certain things (like dungeon finders and transmog) that we take for granted these days. The problem is that everyone looking forward to Classic WoW also has to contend with the fact that this has to be SELF-SUSTAINING as a product for Blizzard to want to keep investing money in its infrastructure, and most people who try it (not all, but most) are going to find the things that they took for granted, instead nowhere to be found.<br />
<br />
I mean, honestly, just wait until you have to get 40 people attuned to Molten Core again... yeah, have fun with that. ;) (Wildstar died because a lot of people left when they realized that the raid design was just like vanilla WoW: large groups and attunements and metric tons of grinding.)<br />
<br />
In a couple months you'll see how wrong you are. Plenty of people still love the old style and philosophy. That part of the playerbase just left over time because Blizzard wanted to appeal to a broader audience and make a more streamlined game. Vanilla WoW is like a book that got turned into a movie. The book's still great, and many people prefer it .<br />
<br />
I've done the MC attunement at least 20 times, and the onyxia attunement 4 times in the past few years. It's enjoyable and rewarding every time.</div></div><hr />

Making a game bad to encourage players to play their newer game? Doesn’t work like that. I for one have zero interest in a diablo mmo. If I quit because I don’t like bfa, blizzard loses a customer that has literally spent thousands of dollars on this game. <br />
<br />
The story in bfa feels disjointed because they split up its presentation between different media formats. And what they did present is just poorly written anyway. (From my Alliance perception.) If I didn’t have friends playing, I would have all ready quit over the story alone. <br />
<br />
At blizzcon, I hope someone asks the devs why the Alliance are in Uldir just to stump them.<br />
<br />
I don't think they are properly trying to torpedo the game, but they are experimenting to see what they can do. <br />
I also think the game has taken a big turn to be more like Diablo and demon hunters are right there in design language for the future. Less abilities, but more overlap in those abilities, DH plays precisely as I imagine a Diablo character being imported into wow would play. <br />
And I mean the story feels disjointed as in we didn't arrive here naturally, it feels last minute. The add-in story that links to BfA from Legion was all added in the last few patches with antorus.<br />
This isn't to say I hate BfA, I don't. I just feel this is what they are doing. I'm looking forward more to classic than retail announcements. As someone said on Twitter I believe, In classic I felt like a normal character doing heroic things, now I feel like a hero doing boring things.<br />

<br />
The only flaw I can see in this is how would the Diablo MMO be any different or better?<br />
<br />
You're not going to transplant the WoW playerbase into Diablo. The standard is too high and the fantasy would be less light-hearted. Diablo is basically a hellscape world with a lot of throwaway lore, most of it dealing with how bad guys became bad guys.<br />
<br />
Never mind that, but how would it be mechanically any different than WoW?<br />
<br />
If anything, WoW seems to be heading down a Diablo-like rabbit hole with tons of throwaway gear and pruning of abilities to the point where you've got maybe five relevant skills for combat. Lots of movement too.<br />
<br />
They can reverse what they've done with a new ip and get back to the roots. Or they can keep going thwir direction, because BfA feels more Diabloish then ever before. <br />
<br />
And the player base would play a Diablo mmo, even if it's more BfA, it's still the only option. Everything else out doesn't compare.</div></div><hr />

Only because no one knew what they were doing. Until I found a guide, I had no idea it was in the game. The quest setup and information resources back then were nothing like what we have now. Attunement guides in Vanilla and BC were literally MS Paint flowcharts.</div></div><hr />

Considering most of the population didn't know where Mankrik's wife was, let alone what a stat like weapon skill did, I can assure you that very few people actually knew about wall jumping, let alone exploring the several areas that you needed it to access. People are vastly overstating what people knew when Vanilla was relevant and acting like a lot of things were common knowledge. Sorry, but most people who played the game then were ignorant and completely retarded, which isn't saying much because most people are still like this.<br />
<br />
I cleared pretty much all the raid content when it was relevant sans the last three bosses in Naxxaramas back in Vanilla, and when people wall jumped in Faerlina's room, pretty much 90% of the raid group (or more) asked &quot;How are you doing that?&quot;. <br />
<br />
It's not an important part of Vanilla, nor is exploring empty zones that didn't make the cut. If it's that important to see those places, they could literally just make them easily accessible without requiring wall jumping so people can explore these areas with absolutely nothing in them.<br />

Loading screens are hand drawn. If just scaled up they’d look ugly. To be fair I don’t see why they need to ask the designer to redraw the pictures for a few second loading screen. An extreme non-issue.</div></div><hr />

If you check, you'll find that most of the people around here that are pushing for the &quot;untouched&quot; vanilla experience for classic are also the ones that are constantly crying over flying, class balance, and the time it takes to level in the modern game. It's going to to be hilarious watching them implode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ony Attunement where you 2man the trash outside BRD for the scrap of paper, then follow Marshal &quot;Herp Derp What's This?&quot; Windsor around BRD?<br />
<br />
Make sure enough get the waters to douse the flame runes for each boss prior to raid. Mages need to arrive 30 minutes prior to summon water for every one. Oh and 8, err 16 no no now its 32 debuffs allowed on the boss. Warlocks need not apply. Put those pallys off to the side to do out of combat ressing during the fight. Wait for 3 sunders before attacking. Need a doorf priest on Mags cause the warrior tank doesn't know how to stance dance. Ah the memories</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get that there is a story behind them but I don’t get why many glorify them so much.<br />
<br />
They don't have to be special. It's about giving the players a valuable reward that isn't gear. It's a feeling of completion. It's something to do that progresses your character. I imagen a lot of people get the same feeling when they get their 176th mount they won't use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I played in classic and new nothing about wall-jumping, so I won't miss it in the slightest.<br />
<br />
As for the demo - I'm confused why they are throttling the at-home players. I get that they need to throttle the live players at the convention, but why the at-home people? The only explanation that makes sense is they're using 1, maybe 2, servers and so they're limiting the amount of players allowed in the zone at any single time for quality of life reasons. I mean, imagine 10,000 people all crammed into Westfall with NO sharding or CRZs. You wouldn't get anything done and it wouldn't be much of a &quot;demo.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm disappointed the demo is so restricted time-wise but I'm still leaning toward possibly buying the virtual ticket to get it...</div></div><hr />

However, I'm highly concerned they're going to be taking liberties with this. I don't want a game that &quot;looks even better than the original version!&quot;.

I'm sure there will not be new models. The new client is just background/optimization stuff - not actual changes to what you see on your end (except widescreen support if you want to nitpick)</div></div><hr />

The point isn't to finish, it's to play. Patience would be waiting for 8.1 until your spec is viable and your character progression isn't a lottery fest.<br />
<br />
We'll see in a few months how tiny the actual playerbase will be right? I'm not worried.<br />
<br />
Considering that Vanilla's &quot;core experience&quot; was a ton of unbalanced classes, completely non-viable specs, classes where you couldn't even use half your abilities because there were only so many buff/debuff slots and gear drops that were locked behind 3-4 hour dungeon runs with the same RNG that exists today, but also with the added constraints of respawning trash, needing specific classes to even be able to clear certain content, and having to travel back to capital cities to reform groups when you lose a person - you are pretty much going to end up with the exact same situation you are in now with BFA - only now, with more grinding.<br />
<br />
This is coming from someone who ran Strat 42 times @ about 2-3 hours per run to finally get my Shadowcraft Spaulders on my Rogue during Vanilla - and good luck getting in a raiding group w/out full T1 and Fire Resist. You guys seem to forget that the average boss had loot tables containing 15+ drops and only dropped 1-2 items per kill. <br />
<br />
You guys also seem to forget that the majority of classes and specs were a shit show in vanilla - so unless you knowingly pick one that is OP as of patch 1.12, you are not just going to be waiting for a month or two for a patch to make that spec you want to play viable, you are going to be waiting until they drop TBC or Wrath servers before you can finally play the spec you want.<br />
<br />
And while we're at it - don't forget all the broken mechanics that limit dungeon clearing, like needing sap in UBRS to be able to efficiently clear the last room, but still having sap with a chance to break stealth when used, which nearly always led to a full wipe. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying Classic won't be fun - I, for one, will play it for nostalgia - for a short time anyways. However, if you guys think you are going to get a balanced, non RNG gameplay experience out of Classic, you are in for a serious shock, as Vanilla was nothing but a grind fest of RNG loot lottery and unbalanced, broken classes and broken mechanics.</div></div><hr />

you didnt get what i meant. no matchmaking auto invite. no lfr. no raid dificulties. 40 men raids. or in short: no changes to vanilla ar all, besides actual classes, the LFG tool to support more than /2 group building, some QoL changes. nothing else.</div></div><hr />

Plenty of people still love the old style and philosophy. That part of the playerbase just left over time because Blizzard wanted to appeal to a broader audience and make a more streamlined game. Vanilla WoW is like a book that got turned into a movie. The book's still great, and many people prefer it .<br />
<br />
I've done the MC attunement at least 20 times, and the onyxia attunement 4 times in the past few years. It's enjoyable and rewarding every time.<br />
<br />
Sure I will. Sure you are.<br />
<br />
Again, talk to the developers of Wildstar who also thought like you did: that people really missed long attunement periods and non-flexible 40 person raids. That was the key to that game's downfall. The MMO player community moved on. <br />
<br />
All those players you talk about who left and never came back... are ten years older (or more) and won't have the time you need to invest. But maybe they do. Maybe we're all wrong.<br />
<br />
But don't take my word for it. I wish you well, honestly, in your never-ending quest for 40 people cooperating long enough to down Onyxia so that one raid leatherworker can make Onyxia Cloaks for all of you, so you can survive Nefarian. And once you do, I genuinely hope it's fun for all of you to get a proper 40-man group together, all the while making sure you have enough paladins on your Alliance team for the buffs, and warlocks for the DOTs who don't mind farming for an hour before each raid just to fill their bags with soul shards. And good luck without heroism because shamans only play Horde side. Plus the other hundreds of little quirks you'll have to live with. <br />
<br />
But I wish you all good luck all the same. I genuinely do hope everyone who wants this has fun. My doubts lie as always with Blizzard, and their need to make money, and their ability to provide resources to this once the allure wears off...</div></div><hr />

True, but those exceptions can be added without bringing back wall jumping. Rock jumping can solve that - no abusing clipping, while making it possible to reach some tricky places.</div></div><hr />

I'd invite every person in this thread to go to YouTube and look up the reaction videos from info releases of past Blizzcons. Specifically, go find Chris Metzen's Cataclysm announcement from the main stage.... the one with the audience's feedback audible on it. <br />
<br />
I was there, like ten rows from the front. I remember the JUBILATION from the player base when &quot;Flying Mounts... In Azeroth&quot; flashed on the screen with an NPC riding over the new Barrens canyon on a dragon. The entire auditorium went absolutely ballistic with joy.<br />

<br />
Nobody knew the Ony and MC attunements weren't in the game? Are you serious? I knew about both before I had my first mount, it was always a topic in guild chat, because some were working on it, early.<br />
<br />
You all act like it was the dark ages, or something. We didn't have everything datamined and spoonfed to us, but we knew about big things like this, and spent large amounts of time working towards them.

<br />
Yes. 32-bit OS tech is 25 years old(Windows NT 3.1 in 1993), it has a ton of limitations in both resource management and security(mainly Win7 issue).<br />
<br />
If you are one of the poor sods who still have not upgraded to win10(which is 64-bit only), you should soon. Starting next retail expansion you are most likely required Windows 10, or at least Windows 8.<br />
<br />
I would expect Classic's client to be mirrored from retail, so when retail needs Win10 to play, Classic will do so as well. This is for compatibility issues with their systems that possibly require functions that only Win10 offers.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm's biggest issues were definitely 4.1 and Dragon Soul. The &quot;rehashing&quot; of the Zul raids into 5-man dungeons made a lot upset. 4.2 was a fantastic patch for many, Firelands always stood as a great raid design plus the Dragonwrath legendary.<br />
<br />
And really, everyone didn't hate Dragon Soul, though the story itself was polarizing (The Dragon Aspects have always been really weak lore IMO), and Deathwing's defeat was anti-climactic. Then it lasted sooooo long, and despite MoP being fantastic, the announcement of &quot;were doing pandas now&quot; in the middle of a burn out made so many people quit. Probably among the biggest mass player exoduses Blizzard would have until WoD.</div></div><hr />

Nostalgia. Reps in vanilla weren't particularly challenging, that was saved for TBC when it launched. It was stuff to do, most of it annoying, to be honest. Hydraxian farming was a pain, to get to Majordomo, until you got revered with them, which was a long ass grind. Getting keys for UBRS was a hell of a lot more work. The Naxx attunement was the worst, because you had to grind pretty expensive matts and drops to get it, plus gold, which lowered the higher your rep with the Argent Dawn was. <br />
<br />
None of it was &quot;hard&quot;, in a real sense, you just had to do it, and with an organized guild, like mine, it got done fairly efficiently.</div></div><hr />

There's a great article on Blizzard Watch today at https://blizzardwatch.com/2018/10/22/no-arent-going-burn-classic-content/ -- part of it is a response to Bellular's latest video, the rest is a sort of refresher on just what people are in for including the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
You needed a Marksman Hunter for the Trueshot Aura buff, which was far more powerful than its current iteration. You needed several Paladins to coordinate all the various buffs they gave, assuming you were Alliance. If you were Horde, you had Shaman and Bloodlust. Tanks were Warriors only by design, with Feral Druids maybe doing some off-tanking. If you could heal, the expectation was you healed. By the last raid, all the Tier gear for Paladins, Druids, Priests, and Shamans was healing gear.<br />
<br />
For me, I raided in vanilla as a mage. Nights when I was the only mage were rough, making food 40 times because tables weren't around. Warlocks had it the worst though, a friend of mine stopped playing toward the end of vanilla because he loved playing a warlock and got sick of burning his time making soul shards...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Projectmars</div><div class="date">2018-10-22, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Memory is a funny thing. Everyone talks about how wonderful WOTLK was, and when I was raiding Ulduar and ICC, it was (Ulduar is still probably my favorite raid ever). Of course, now we look back and realize that leveling through BC and WOTLK areas is almost painful...<br />
<br />
BC yes, but WotLK… I did actually have fun and enjoyed leveling through those zones... but I also enjoyed the heck of those zones. Music and zone layout was pretty well done in that expansion, imo.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tharkkun</div><div class="date">2018-10-22, 09:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Simply was never an option, and Blizzard would be pretty dumb to bring in the old code even if they could. The Vanilla code was so unstable the next two expanasion had to be devoped in a way that they wouldn't touch it. Refactoring propely documented code is a huge task (Why cataclysm is by far their largest expansion), and from all the developers I've read who have worked on Vanilla WOW was that it was thrown together like a last minute Homework project.<br />
<br />
Far from the truth. Wow was developed for over 5 years. Something created by hundreds of people over that period of time is going to make things difficult when you go back for changes. It doesn't matter how commented the code is. It was due to design decisions at the time that may not have been the most optimal at the time but it got the job done. <br />
<br />
The backpack was one of these. It was integrated so heavily into the quest system, loot system, auction house, etc, etc, that changing it to a normal backpack so they could increase the size took years because every system that hooked into it also had to be updated first.<br />
<br />
Tons of systems were re-engineered such as pets, toys, mounts, cosmetic appearances. They never planned on WoW having more than 500k subscribers or staying around like it has. No one did. <br />
<br />
Cata was huge though but from an artwork standpoint. They basically re-designed 60 zones which is insane.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, all classes had their place in raids (Except Shaman had no Bloodlust in Vanilla), but not all Specs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The entire point of classic is to relive the good old days and hop into nostalgia. One of my favorite things to do in classic was explore, going places I shouldn't be just for fun. I loved climbing to the top of Ironforge, for instance.<br />
<br />
If they are taking that away, they are dramatically decreasing the experience of classic. For me, this is comparable to adding achievements, new animations, updated models, etc. It simply isn't classic, it just pretends to be, vaguely. Sure, I could still play it and sate some of my satisfaction but the game simply wouldn't be vanilla, and I'd be bored quickly.<br />
<br />
This is the good old Blizzard tactic of &quot;it was fun, it wasn't intended to be fun, we fixed it&quot;. It makes me wonder what other things they have 'fixed'.<br />
<br />
PS: This isn't really for your benefit since you are obviously little more than a smartass, but I felt I should elaborate none the less for the benefit of anyone else who might feel similarly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2018-10-22, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This definitely raises an eyebrow. I don't want &quot;the Classic experience I *think* I want&quot;. I want the *actual* Classic experience.<br />
<br />
If this is truly limited to fixing far-reaching exploits, compatibility, or accessibility options, then all good.<br />
<br />
However, I'm highly concerned they're going to be taking liberties with this. I don't want a game that &quot;looks even better than the original version!&quot;. I want the classic experience, good and bad. And honestly, given that they're clearly prevent players from accessing &quot;out-of-bounds&quot; areas, I'm extremely concerned the direction they're going with all this.<br />
<br />
Okay.<br />
<br />
You will never have the actual Classic experience - not without a time machine. What you expect and demand is literally impossible. The players are different, the world is different, 14 years have passed and the vast majority of people on the Classic servers will be completely different kinds of players than Classic. Classic was people trying MMOs for the first time. Hell, people in my guild, WoW was their first video game. <br />
<br />
You have raised a bar into an expectation that is impossible - and it's kind of hilarious. They couldn't even deliver an *actual* Classic experience if they shipped you a 2004 era computer with 2004 era software, installed a dial up connection in your home (because a LOT of people played on dial up back then), and filled your music library with 2004 era pop hits. The people who made Classic what it was aren't the same anymore, and without that, it's always going to be a sightseeing trip to the past, recreating - or trying to - an era that's long gone. <br />
<br />
This &quot;purist&quot; mindset is really more entertaining than the idea of playing old WOW, warts and all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I loved WOTLK zones when it was the latest content. Going back and leveling allied races, though, is awful at 60-80. (I'm holding out hope that they eventually make all of the expacs prior to Legion viable for 60-100 leveling.) <br />
<br />
Of course, that was after I'd already had two years of being max level for vanilla. I had enough to do at the time to get my one character up to 60, mostly by grinding and dungeons, because of course there aren't enough quests to level with in vanilla WOW.</div></div><hr />

You think you want vanilla, but you don’t. You want your specific memories with your friends back, wall jumping and all.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, Gadzooks, I think you'll find that the above is the ONLY thing the classic WoW fans want, nothing else.<br />

You didn't need wall jumping to see the &quot;under construction&quot; signs, and they weren't as exciting to find as you think they were.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough, so there's even one LESS item usable in classic WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh. I mained a rogue back then, and making the case for a rogue in most raid guilds was an uphill climb, because the class had no raid utility and were too squishy - and so gear dependant it was sick. Rogues shone in PvP in Classic, not raiding. Combat was a leveling spec, at best. If you wanted to be pushing the current raid content, rogues were definitely on the bench on most raid teams, unless they needed cc - and mages made way more sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, i don't know other people. I played WoW since Vanilla, and i sincerely feel like that. Maybe nostalgia attached to those days?<br />
<br />
Maybe some races aren't so obvious, but pick undead for example. To me it is too different.<br />
<br />
Also, humans. For paladins, tier 2 looks amazing. But new &quot;skeleton&quot; movement feels so awkward with it.<br />
<br />
Some race/gender combos also wear the armor slightly different than the way they used to. <br />
<br />
i changed most of my old transmog with the new models because of this. Something really felt off to me.<br />

<br />
Thanks for naming all the features I dislike about modern WoW. :D Although TBC and early-WoTLK were my favourite iterations of WoW, I think I’ll enjoy Classic :)<br />
<br />

Its classic reinterpreted for the BFA engine, shrugs Im suddenly totally not interested in it now, give me proper classic or GTFO with this trash.<br />
<br />
Wrath of the Lich King engine, actually.</div></div><hr />

Please don't tell these people that in 1.12 (the version we get) it was already all but gone in most cases. They might have a heart attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And like I've said in this thread, that's totally fine. I genuinely hope the people who are waiting for this enjoy it.<br />
<br />
But I think you should probably also temper your expectations, starting with the fact that by the time you get your first character to 60, the allure will have worn off for a lot of people... people you'll need to stock 40 man raids and help with things like resistance gear and Onyxia cloaks. It'll just be people playing for themselves (no achievements! no transmog! no dungeon/raid finders!) in hopes Blizzard makes enough money with it to continue it. Maybe they will. I'm just very skeptical.<br />
<br />
(I'm sorry, but I keep going back to Wildstar, developed by WOW vanilla developers. They thought there was a market for 40 man raids and attunements and long endgame grinds, and they publicly advertised such. They were sadly mistaken. That game will shut down completely on November 25 because of their miscalculations.)</div></div><hr />

Trust me, I understand. And it's not all of them - about half of them have expectations that Classic is going to be like a real game, with updates, new content, even expansions. Which is going to be crushed like the irrational expectations of the snooty &quot;I will only accept an authentic experience&quot; crowd is.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">papajohn4</div><div class="date">2018-10-22, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they talk about things phased out of the game ages ago because it was simply trash game designs. Things that would be considered bugs today. And people want this over bfa and call bfa buggy ? Lapdogs. all of you.<br />
<br />
Classic wow is a collosal waste of resources and should NEVER happen<br />
<br />
Still angry about it? <br />
<br />
btw, how many turtles you saved today? :D:D:D</div></div><hr />

I've heard EVE: Echoes was just announced. Maybe I'll give this new EVE game a look instead later on, it's not vanilla EVE Online, but it will ease the drama over how WoW Classic is not truly vanilla either. Sort of a neutral option.</div></div><hr />
