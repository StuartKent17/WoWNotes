Patch 3.3 - Portable Hole, Arctic Furs, and new Pets<br />
Patch 3.3 will add a few interesting items to NPCs, I never took the time to post about it and the apparition of the Portable Hole (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/51809/portable-hole/) on PTRs is probably a good occasion to do it.<br />
<br />
Portable Hole<br />
A new 24 slot bag is available in game, the Portable Hole (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/51809/portable-hole/). It won't be really hard to get it, the only condition is to sit on a lot of gold! Haris Pilton sells it in the World's End Tavern in Shattrath City for 3000G. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/portablehole_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/portablehole.jpg)<br />
<br />
Calico Cat and Albino Snake<br />
Breanni in Dalaran sells two more pets, the Calico Cat (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/46398/calico-cat/) and the Albino Snake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44822/albino-snake/) are both available for 50G.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/calicocat_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/calicocat.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/albinosnake_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/november/albinosnake.jpg)<br />

<br />
Arctic Furs<br />
Arctic Furs (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44128/arctic-fur/) can now be traded for 10 x Heavy Borean Leather (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/38425/heavy-borean-leather/) in Dalaran. This will probably be enough to rise the price of the leather to a point where people won't be able to buy it from the AH and craft items to sell them back to NPCs for a profit.<br />
<br />

Patch 3.3 - Blood-Queen Vampires<br />
The latest PTR build added a few tweaks to the existing Fel Blood Elves models ... These monsters will most likely appear during the fight against Blood-Queen Lana'thel, the final boss of the Crimson Hall of Icecrown Citadel. (This was mostly a test for a video with multiple models but ... no reason to not post it I guess) <br />

Blizzard Pet Store Now Regional<br />
We will be making a change to the Pet Store such that pets purchased from the online store can only be claimed with World of Warcraft accounts registered to the region from which the purchase was made. In order to claim a pet from our Pet Store, your account must be registered to the same region as the store from which you purchased the pet. Players who have already purchased a pet from a store in one region and redeemed it on an account in a different region will remain unaffected by this change. Players on U.S. realms can access the U.S. Pet Store here: http://us.blizzard.com/store/ <br />
<br />
Cross-Faction BoA Item Mailing<br />
Then the good news is that, if you're able to patiently wait for patch 3.3 you will probably be rewarded with the very thing you're requesting. That's right, we aim to implement the ability to exchange bind-on-account items between your Horde and Alliance characters in patch 3.3. Of course, as with anything not yet live (and even things that are) this is subject to change, but it currently remains our intention. Hope that helps somewhat, or rather, hope that will help somewhat. ;-) <br />

Emblems of Triumphs in Heroics in Patch 3.3<br />
While we have changed the emblem system several times since the inception of badges of justice back in The Burning Crusade, we feel this is currently a good way to go so players aren't forced to run just old content like Naxxramas for 2 months to work their character/alt up to do higher/new content. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677776573-triumph-badges-becoming-herioc-badges-soon.html))<br />
<br />
Tank mitigation and utility abilities<br />
Assuming I'm understanding you correctly, we don't balance tank survivability around utility abilities like say Cleanse or Death Grip. We try to make sure all the classes have a certain number of those. We do balance survivability around cooldowns that affect survivability. My recent caution to not over-interpret effective health was that A) cooldowns matter, and B) it's difficult to quantify those cooldowns as part of EH. (Avoidance matters too. You may not gear for it, but it matters and you'd notice it if it was gone.)<br />
<br />
I totally agree about the context part as well. I try and say often that the encounter is everything. Most of the time when players are posting from the point of view of who is the best tank or whether a certain tank is a liability to the raid, what they really mean is &quot;on Sartharion +3, Mimiron hard, Vezax hard, Gormok hard or Anub'arak hard&quot; because those are the most challenging encounters in which to keep a tank alive.<br />
<br />
If Sindragosa is the hardest boss in Icecrown, and if she does a ton of magical damage, and if Unholy death knights have a much easier time tanking her because of this, then you'd see a lot of arguments over magical mitigation and cooldowns. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677336086-niche-advantages-vs-real-advantages.html))<br />
<br />
Onyxia Whelpling Pet<br />
The Onyxia Whelpling pet will be available in-game soon, though I don't have an exact date offhand. If you login on a regular basis it should just appear in your mailbox sometime this month. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677676296-err-the-onyxia-pet.html))<br />

Lay on Hands and Forbearance in 3.3<br />
The change we're thinking about now is that LoH only causes Forbearance if you cast it on yourself. A paladin healing a paladin tank wouldn't run into the Forbearance problem.<br />
<br />
We don't think the paladin tank needs to be able to stack both tools at once. If you know big damage is coming you can use Divine Protection. If you managed to take the big damage, you can use Lay on Hands. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677235952-if-loh-is-gonna-cause-forbearance.html))<br />

Infernal Cooldown Reduction<br />
The problem with lowering the Doomguard cooldown to ~10 min is there is a reasonable chance Affliction would just use the Doomguard all the time.<br />
<br />
We want the temporary warlock demons to useful but not actually replace the core demons. An interesting idea for Cataclysm is for them not to replace the current demon. I have no idea if we'll do this or not, but we won't be able to do it for 3.3. <br />
<br />
[...] If you read the patch notes, you'll see that we lowered the cooldown on almost every long cooldown ability. The ones we did not lower (like the Doomguard) we didn't lower for specific reasons. This was not an attempt to buff Inferno and make it something all warlocks use. It was a pass at all of the long cooldowns still in the game. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677235429-infernal-cooldown-lol.html))<br />
<br />
Pets and Guardians<br />
The way the current technology works is you can have one pet or many guardians. Pets have a pet bar and guardians do not. We get around the first limitation on group pets like the shaman wolves by having them both use the same pet bar.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't be too hard to make a guardian Doomguard or Infernal pop out without replacing the Imp or Felhound etc. but then you'd lose the ability to give it specific commands. Having a second pet bar pop out or having one pet bar give different commands to different pets is something we currently can't do. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677235429-infernal-cooldown-lol.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I think there is some promise to the idea that warlocks might have permanent pets and guardians, with the Doomguard and Infernal as dps-timers in the second category, much like Force of Nature or Mirror Image. But we're going to have to think through that design and analyze the technical and balance implications. Maybe it will work and maybe it won't, but it isn't going to happen for 3.3. If you'd like, we can bump the Inferno cooldown back up if it bothers you so much. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677235429-infernal-cooldown-lol.html))<br />
<br />
Affliction Spec<br />
We didn't like the way Affliction played. There were players who liked having so many dots and players who didn't. It certainly wasn't the case that whoever QQ'd the most won (and I suspect it was the pro dot crowd who QQ'd the most). We wanted to make Affliction more about the Shadow spells and Destruction more about the Fire spells. We wanted each to have a core group of spells upon which they focused. That is happening now and I believe both specs are fun to play. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677235429-infernal-cooldown-lol.html))<br />

Mocking Blow &quot;change&quot; in latest PTR build<br />
As several have pointed out, this was just a tooltip clarification. The ability hasn't changed.<br />
<br />
I agree with the notion that there is less of a use for Mocking Blow in the toolbox these days where tanks generally maintain enough threat, at least relative to the &quot;Wait for five Sunders&quot; days. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20860998894--mocking-blow.html))<br />

Then the good news is that, if you're able to patiently wait for patch 3.3 you will probably be rewarded with the very thing you're requesting. That's right, we aim to implement the ability to exchange bind-on-account items between your Horde and Alliance characters in patch 3.3. Of course, as with anything not yet live (and even things that are) this is subject to change, but it currently remains our intention. Hope that helps somewhat, or rather, hope that will help somewhat. ;-) <br />

I do understand that they want people to progress through further end game content, i just wish they could think of another way to do it, like making all raids (except ICC which will drop frosts) drop triumphs, and actually keep the other badges useful (don't think many people use valorous anymore and heroism is pretty much only usable for BoA items)</div></div><hr />

While we have changed the emblem system several times since the inception of badges of justice back in The Burning Crusade, we feel this is currently a good way to go so players aren't forced to run just old content like Naxxramas for 2 months to work their character/alt up to do higher/new content. (Source)<br />
<br />
I totally agree with this. While most buttholes here say &quot;ZOMG NUBS GIT TEH FREE EPIX!!1!&quot;, I have like 5 80's and 2 70somethings, and am currently working on a 60something Shaman. I was dreading having to run everything under the sun to have to gear up to be able to do the stuff that my guild does for alt runs (all versions of ToC for alt runs).<br />
<br />
So while people will continue to bitch about new people getting gear, think about it really... who does this benefit more? The FEW new people that pop up once in a while, or the people like us who have been playing this game for years and are raising like our 8th or so character? I don't give a flying eff if the new people do get good free loot, doesn't bother how I play the game. But this does help me get geared in order to do more stuff with my guild.</div></div><hr />

I dont think so. For me every T10 Set represents a different Model in ICC. Rogues the Geists, DKs the Lich King, Mages the San´layn and Warlocks the Cult of the Damned Members... Especially the Warrior Set looks amazing for me</div></div><hr />

QQ arctic fur change, bye bye income.<br />
What's next, 10 imbued frostweave for a spellweave/moonshroud/ebonweave? It's already hard enough to make money from crafting professions without ToC patterns, now this &gt;_&gt;.

<br />
Doesnt mean that just because rogues looks like geists etc the sets are good. Geists look awfull and so do the memember of the cult. When players kill some hard bosses they expect to get rewarded with sth beautiful that worths the effort, not with a crap looking piece of armor. Geists are the most disgusting creatures in wow along with the slimes. The warrior set looks ok as i said but try comparing it to this http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=673#modelviewer:4:1;49684;3;45661;5;45658;6;48361;7;45660;8;48372;9;48348;10;4565 9:6+0<br />
even the old t3 http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=523#modelviewer:4:1;36730;3;35177;5;35049;6;35058;7;35051;8;35067;9;35044;10;3505 0:4+0 looks better<br />
or the paladin armor with this http://www.wowhead.com/?itemset=680#modelviewer:4:1;45684;3;45884;5;46350;6;48355;7;45686;8;48366;9;48313;10;4568 5:10+0 <br />
Generally t6 was much better than t10 as an endgame set. Even t5 was better tbh...</div></div><hr />

Thats true, i also think thats a bit too much. The Glacial Bag has 22 Slots and costs in AH between 300 and 600 gold. I´d rather buy this one than the bag from Harris Pilton. But for People with a lot of gold an chronically full Bags its nice.</div></div><hr />

While we have changed the emblem system several times since the inception of badges of justice back in The Burning Crusade, we feel this is currently a good way to go so players aren't forced to run just old content like Naxxramas for 2 months to work their character/alt up to do higher/new content. (Source)<br />
<br />
But we are forced to run old heroics instead!!! What is the difference?!?!<br />
<br />
/edit Also is how the game will progress in future? Each patch the upper tier of emblems becomes the new lower tier? Kinda devalues the effort you put in to get the newer emblems.</div></div><hr />

It's just another gold sink. it's not too much, those running around with 100k gold can now drop some of it, while those with fewer cash just don't get those extra 2 slots &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Yeaaaah.... I'd rather do Heroics that everyone has done that everyone can faceroll through than to do older raids that people still mess up on because they are retarded. Faster to get a 5 man together than a 10 or 25 man too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That&amp;#180;s true. Its much faster to find 4 people than 10 oder 25, and ofc its much faster to run a heroic ini, than go Naxx or whatever. But the main reason why you&amp;#180;re right is, that you can hardly mess up in a HC. Nowadays i see full ulduar and ToC guys who die at naxx bosses.</div></div><hr />

Base ability since release. Still don't have a proper second on use cooldown, LOH is the only sort of second cooldown we have. Just a bad idea. Thought 3.3 would finally fix this problem not make it worse.<br />
<br />
They first wanted it to not be able to be cast on the paladin who's using it, this was earlier in 3.3. Apparently they felt bad about changing an 'iconic' paladin ability, so they decided that it would only give the casting pally Forebearance. Forbearance &gt; uncastibility amirite? GC also wanted to lower the '3 phase fight' that it would need to kill a paladin, so it's now a '2 phase fight'. If you're a protection paladin using LoH in PvE content, tell your healer to wake the fuck up.</div></div><hr />

Because it's not DLC. I find myself laughing while reading DLC more often then while reading gladiators. But I think it's just different (and I don't mean 'special' like your average melee hunter), and I'm looking forward what will happen in the future (I guess, like the author mentioned, it will go away from arena more to common stuff...taking the risk of become standard web comic fodder. we'll see. don't give up on it yet)</div></div><hr />

I am unsure why he said the model got edited since they didn't get changed at all. At first glance I didn't think anything changed but then I compared the Live and PTR version side by side and there wasn't a single bit of difference between the 2 model-wise or in the animations. I guess his real reason was only to do the 2 models thing.</div></div><hr />
