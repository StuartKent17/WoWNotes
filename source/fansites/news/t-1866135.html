Matchmaking Normal Difficulty Groups<br />
Very unlikely, the extra convenience of having an automated queuing system for normal mode would be immediately defeated by the lack of coordination that these groups are usually accustomed to.<br />
<br />
LFR's difficulty level is tuned exactly to match the level of coordination that one can expect (on average) from a group formed by an automated system.<br />
<br />
Let people queue for Normal if they want to - but don't change mechanics to accommodate random queueing. Leave Nm as it is, difficulty-wise.<br />
Given that extra option, I believe very few would be satisfied with queueing for LFR only.<br />
<br />
What you said actually sounds reasonable at first, but once such an option becomes available, it creates false expectations. If such content isn't properly tuned for random grouping, it will only lead to nerf requests. We see that happening all the time even in LFR as I'm sure you're all aware, especially when new raids launch and they're slightly over-tuned.<br />
<br />
There's also this issue with automated systems and their detrimental effects on the social potential of a game, which is an essential factor for any mmorpg, so we want to be very careful whenever we expand or change such systems.

BlizzCon Opening Week – October 28 to November 1<br />
Last year, we needed an extra weekend for all the World Championship eSports. This year, we need a week! The Heroes of the Storm, Hearthstone, and WoW Arena World Championships, along with the StarCraft II WCS Global Finals, will launch from Burbank, CA between October 28 and November 1.<br />
<br />
The BlizzCon Opening Week will host 96 elite eSports players from across the globe battling for the opportunity to be crowned World Champion at BlizzCon. This is eSports you need to watch, and you’ll have plenty of streaming options available on BlizzCon.com for each game.<br />
<br />
So, which matches will be played at BlizzCon Opening Week, and when? We’ve broken it out for each game below:<br />
<br />
Hearthstone World Championship<br />
Prize Pool: $250,000<br />
Number of Players: 16<br />
Schedule: October 28-31, 9:00 a.m. PDT<br />
<br />
Matches: The Hearthstone World Championship kicks off with four groups of four players vying against each other in a dual-elimination format. Match 1 of each group will play October 28, with Match 2 and the first eliminations on October 29. October 30-31 will see each match advancing a player to BlizzCon, as we make our way through the winners and decider matches of each group.<br />
<br />
Heroes of the Storm World Championship<br />
Prize Pool: $500,000<br />
Number of Players: 8 Teams (5 players per team)<br />
Schedule: October 28, 1:30 p.m. PDT<br />
<br />
Matches: The Heroes of the Storm World Championship features 2 dual-tournament groups in the first round. No teams will be eliminated during Opening Week, but each team will get to show their stuff in the initial matches of each group.<br />
<br />
WoW Arena World Championship<br />
Prize Pool: $250,000<br />
Number of Players: 8 teams (3 players per team)<br />
Schedule: October 30-31, 1:30 p.m. PDT<br />
<br />
Matches: Each of the 2 dual-tournament groups in the Round of 8 will compete October 30-31. Two teams will advance to the Round of 4 bracket (played at BlizzCon November 6) based on the results of these matches, while the other two Ro4 teams will be determined at BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
StarCraft II World Championship Series Global Finals<br />
Prize Pool: $250,000<br />
Number of Players: 16<br />
Schedule: November 1, 10:00 a.m. PST <br />
<br />
Matches: The Global Finals will follow last year’s tried and true format. The top 16 players in the WCS Global Standings (http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/en/standings) will be seeded into a single elimination bracket. All matches of the Round of 16 bracket will take place November 1. Eight of the 16 players will advance to the Round of 8 matches (played at BlizzCon November 6).<br />
<br />
You’ll also be able to watch coverage of the BlizzCon opening ceremony and all of the StarCraft II, Hearthstone, World of Warcraft, and Heroes of the Storm matches taking place at BlizzCon for free in HD at www.blizzcon.com (http://www.blizzcon.com/). The StarCraft II finals will also be available to watch via the official WCS website (http://wcs.battle.net/sc2/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Twitch Battle.Net Integration<br />
Twitch has added the ability to link your Battle.Net account to your Twitch account and Blizzard is giving away a Heroes of the Storm portrait to those who link it and watch some of a Heroes of the Storm regional championship. Some kind of reward could be added for WoW in the future!<br />
Twitch and Blizzard are teaming up to reward those who not only love to play Heroes of the Storm, but watch it, too!<br />
<br />
Secure your portrait<br />
For a limited time, anyone who watches a Heroes of the Storm regional championship while logged into Twitch with a linked Battle.net account will receive a special “Storm Watcher” portrait in Heroes of the Storm.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/september/thumb/hotsWatcher.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/september/hotsWatcher.jpg) <br />
<br />
Your first opportunity to secure this portrait is quickly approaching. Tune in to the Americas Championship on September 19 and 20, and you’ll be among the first to receive the new portrait. After watching the Americas or other regional championship events, the portrait will be awarded to qualifying players starting in October, when it will appear in your in-game portrait collection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Log in to your account on Twitch.<br />
Navigate to the Settings menu by clicking your account name in the top-right corner of the home screen.<br />
Click on the Connections tab.<br />
Follow the instructions after selecting a region and clicking Connect next to Battle.net.<br />
<br />
<br />
Click Here to go straight to the Twitch.tv settings page! (http://www.twitch.tv/settings)<br />
<br />
Do I need to keep my accounts linked to receive the portrait?<br />
In order to make sure we're able to properly grant the portrait award, please make sure you leave the accounts linked until the portrait has been awarded to your Battle.net account. We hope to offer additional promotions using this technology in the future, so we recommend leaving the account link in place if you’re interested in participating.<br />
<br />
If I watch another region's championship and have my account linked, will I receive the reward in my home region?<br />
Yes, watching the Americas, Korea, Europe, or Taiwan championships on Twitch will grant you the in-game portrait in all regions.<br />
<br />
If I watch the event on a mobile device will I receive the portrait?<br />
Yes, as long as you are logged in to Twitch and your accounts are linked while you watch the event, you will be eligible for the portrait reward.<br />
<br />
Will other Blizzard games offer similar promotions?<br />
The Heroes of the Storm “Storm Watcher” portrait is the only active promotion currently available. We’re considering rolling out similar promotions for our other games, but we don’t have any additional details to share at this time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kopykat</div><div class="date">2015-09-18, 12:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">for me wow is incredibly hard to follow than say HotS or LoL. I can only tell how people are moving, but no way to tell what spell they used and what the intention is. Wow is very &quot;busy&quot; compared to MOBAs. With Mobas there are only a few spells to keep track of and they are visually obvious most of the time. Add to that the fact that the screen isn't cluttered with addons and random stuff, and is basically the same across all streams, they are far easier to follow and appreciate via streams due to clarity and consistency.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I can see the appeal to streams for folks that want to listen to someone live as they play, but I watch streams mainly to learn. With Wow I find that easier to do by reading something and then making it happen in game.</div></div><hr />

I find myself watching a lot more Starcraft/HotS because there is more availability and tournament scene for those games, not through lack of interest in WoW streams. If there were more tournaments in WoW esports I would definitely watch them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For things like WoW and other casual games I agree. Watching competitive game tournaments in Dota 2 and especially Starcraft 2 is a whole other deal though. We're talking about people who might play the game 10+ hours per day. They end up really good and can do some sick plays you can only dream about accomplishing. It's a bit like watching any normal sport, but since you also play the games it will also help you play better.</div></div><hr />

They're just not interesting to me. The only times I have regularly watched them is when a raid is new, and I watch people who are farther than my guild is progressing on them a bit. I don't care about PvP so the tournaments do nothing for me.</div></div><hr />

If u watch a stream for a game , then u are doing it wrong. U come to twitch for the streamers , they are supposed to entertain u not the game.</div></div><hr />

color me surprised, but why would i want to watch a live stream (or pre-recorded) of someone else playing a game that i can just go play? i just dont see the point of it, unless it is to explain how to do something difficult (think achievement of some sort)</div></div><hr />

too bad there isn't a 'do you watch any twitch streams of people playing games' question for reference, probably a lot of people who answered 'no' doesnt watch any streams (like me)</div></div><hr />

I love watching pve / mythic raiding, especially when a new raid comes out and guilds are struggling on bosses for the first time. Its really intense watching a guild work a boss down that they have been struggling on for weeks.<br />
<br />
Ive always been a pve focused player, so i guess it makes sense that im only interested in that portion of the game.</div></div><hr />

I have times where I want to play a game and then I have times where I want to relax and watch something, some people watch series, films, w/e... instead of those some people like to watch streamers as if they were watching series or films. The idea is you find something that you like watching, being a streamer, actors, or w/e you into. You don't watch a streamer in replacement of you playing a game, it's outside of your gaming time, or at the same time since dual or triple monitors is standard now a days.</div></div><hr />

It improves the accuracy of Twitch and Blizz's marketing data, connecting advertisers to target users that would be the most receptive.<br />

I like reading about upcoming changes and updates to games I play but other than that, I'd rather play the game than watch a bunch of losers play the game. I say 'losers' because these streamers usually try way too hard to be funny/cool and it's pretty off putting.<br />

If someone's participating in a high-level tournament that you certainly will never be able to attend, why would it automatically be a bad thing to watch them play, just because you can jump around in low-level arenas yourself? That's like saying why watch high-level sports teams when you can go out and fumble the ball in your own time.<br />
<br />
I personally spend very little time watching WoW streams these days, but I still do get pretty excited when a particularly dramatic tournament game's just played out.</div></div><hr />

I have times where I want to play a game and then I have times where I want to relax and watch something, some people watch series, films, w/e... instead of those some people like to watch streamers as if they were watching series or films. The idea is you find something that you like watching, being a streamer, actors, or w/e you into. You don't watch a streamer in replacement of you playing a game, it's outside of your gaming time, or at the same time since dual or triple monitors is standard now a days.<br />
<br />
Yes, everyone already understands all that.<br />
<br />
There are much better shows to watch. The streams are boring. I'd watch someone I know play, over at their house, but not random boring strangers.<br />
<br />
Also: The streamers are annoying. They spend most of the time talking or chatting to people watching instead of playing the game.<br />
<br />
If you're into it, that's great. It doesn't mean people don't understand it, they just don't like it or think it's boring, etc.<br />

I had imagined more people would have watched wow twitch streams (at least among those who visit this site).<br />
<br />
Color me surprised.<br />
<br />
Twitch streams are the #2 most boring activity. #1 is watching paint dry or grass grow.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing people who watch them are fans of the person streaming... that's usually how it works. Dizzy Kitten for example.</div></div><hr />

Oh you meant what's the advantage for YOU didn't you? I got nothing.<br />
<br />
Might be the first step of an ingame streaming tool... Let us dream :D</div></div><hr />

I'm completely against the idea of queuing for Normal Mode raids but come on, &quot;nerf requests&quot; doesn't mean you HAVE to nerf content.<br />
<br />
I understand that the difficulty of an instance shouldn't be that hard when you play with random people but let's be honest.. if players can't do Normal Mode then those players have to get better at the game. It's a common sense to me, playing is good but getting better is even better. (Duh)<br />
If you are set up to 100% win and the game give you free &quot;loots&quot; without doing anything special (Yep, just like LFR) then it's not a game, period, you don't play a game.. you are just logging on this wow-icon on your desktop and receiving gifts from Blizzard without doing anything.</div></div><hr />
