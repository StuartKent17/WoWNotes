Legion PvP Testing<br />
This morning, a wave of invites was sent out with a focus on PvP experience. We'll continue to monitor participation. Thanks! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405780-accurate-testing/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743015132?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Item Level Scaling in PvP<br />
Can we get any confirmation how it trickles down to lower level PvP? Still static 0.1%?<br />
Low levels are currently set to the same scaling values as level 110. The baseline item level is different for each bracket. It is approximately the ilevel of an heirloom item at the max level for each bracket. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405378-anyone-know-how-ilv-is-scaled-in-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743024723?page=1#10))<br />
<br />
Grove Warden<br />
Will they ever fix Grove warden? The camera bug is making me so dizzy, I love the looks of the mount but can't stand using it.<br />
Just a... heads-up... this is something that we are aware of and it's being tracked for a fix in an upcoming patch. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/405630-groove-warden/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17610891710?page=1#9))<br />

Classes<br />
doesn't matter when often one &quot;style&quot; is too good not to play over the other talent. i often choose my gameplay style by class.<br />
During alpha, you should pretty much ignore tuning. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709792052326703104))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s) / Artifact Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#tAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#s))<br />
happy with the state of balance druid gameplay on #legion? Would love to hear design goal, spec seems a bit... lost atm<br />
Balance is looking solid, especially after the latest Artifact revisions. Any specific feedback or questions? https://t.co/hyt0g0EJ7q (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709558212911964160))<br />
Our issues are here in this post, but no Dev gave us an answer.https://t.co/DvhMjCUogp<br />
That feedback is almost exclusively about tuning, which hasn't happened yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709567924017754112))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Will male-BE in #legion eventually get ALL the updated melee animations? (i.e. Bloodthirst upwards swing instead of old spin)<br />
This is an interesting question. They have the animations, but some iconic race-specific animations are still... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709464102666522624))<br />
...used for a few things, since players found them iconic. Don't want to lose all the soul of the race. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709464670193717248))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Will the Warglaives of Azzinoth be recoded as &quot;warglaives&quot; with new warglaive animations? Or still swords and old animation?<br />
It's important that Warriors and Rogues continue to be able to use them, so they will likely remain as swords. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709558649702625280))<br />
<br />
The shapeshift camera bug is there with ghost wolf form, too<br />
We are aware of this issue across many transformations on the Alpha. We're working on fixing it soon. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709558961939177473))<br />
<br />
Artifact based abilities seem to act like Artifact is a separate mob - critless DotS, only 5% Crit, no benefits from Mastery<br />
They should act like you casting them, using your stats. It's a bug if not. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/709816076243107840))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Curious if WarcraftDevs are seeing anyone use Adaptation or Relentless in #PVP. Everyone I've seen uses Medallion. <br />
We would be interested in hearing feedback from players who have tried Adaptation or Relentless in PvP. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709552349438545920))<br />
<br />
Will we get an option to see our PvP Prestige progress on a bar like our Xp and Artifact Power?<br />
Yes, this will be an option! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/709552558860140544))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
LFD was a choice between doing content or not doing it at all. Could take hours to find dungeon groups.<br />
I'll argue that's a false dichotomy. I agree with the problem but maybe there were other solutions. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709431161114591233))<br />
<br />
I dont get why you think matchmaking is no valid group setup mechanism if most of the players prefer it over organization.<br />
I think they are valuing convenience though. It's like being surprised that players like free loot. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709466072739479552))<br />
In BC, Mechanar was the most popular dungeon by far. I don't think it was for the encounters. It was for quick badges. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709466531550244865))<br />
So you just have to be careful when you measure participation that you don't mis-conclude they love the content they are doing. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/709466737628975110))<br />

So they're not allowed to have an Old-God themed expansion in HS because we haven't seen all old gods in WoW? We weren't ever going to see Y'shaaraj in WoW since he died long ago, who knows when we'll see N'zoth... let's just enjoy the awesome art, can we?</div></div><hr />

Well that's because WoW isn't a project but its still their biggest game. Blizzard don't have &quot;main&quot; things anymore as they have different teams (which may sometimes overlap) to develop for different things. Its hardly in maintenance mode when as i said its still their biggest game and will continue to do so most likely.</div></div><hr />

Agreed 100%.<br />
<br />
I wasn't always a fan of his while he was here, due to things like lfr ... but ... he also has the benefit of experience and seeing what worked and what didn't. Losing him means you lose a lot of that experience and may relegate yourself to repeating past lessons that had already been learned.<br />

<br />
<br />
Not disagreeing with his comments, but the fact that he also doesn't have anything to do with current Bliz lets him be free to speak his mind. It sounds like he regrets LFD/LFR, but if you tried and remove that now, you'll be lynched even worse than flight being removed. People already demand overleveled ilevels for Mythic dungeons. Remove auto-grouping and suddenly groups are harder than ever to get into :/<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, that's one way to kill the suspense of a BIG reveal...<br />
<br />
Because if it was in WoW, the suspense of the big reveal wouldn't have just been ruined by being datamined and posted here?</div></div><hr />

I would argue that's because the rewards sometimes don't match up to the effort or time you put into it.<br />
<br />
I remember being able to farm Wrath dungeons for emblems so I could catch up alts on my own time. Apparently that's considered unacceptable now.</div></div><hr />

C'Thun, Yogg-saron, N'Zoth, and Y'Shaarj are the four. ($1 to HP Lovecraft)</div></div><hr />

Blizz really doesnt handle intros for their big star-villains very good. Reminds me a bit of letting Azshara show up during some random level 14 quest in Dark Shore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember being able to farm Wrath dungeons for emblems so I could catch up alts on my own time. Apparently that's considered unacceptable now.<br />
<br />
I get what GC is saying - he wants players to appreciate the encounter, to be there for the fight, and the lore, and the teamwork.<br />
<br />
But that's at odds with how the majority of players use the content. They don't want to enjoy a dungeon, they want to grind it as quickly and efficiently as possible, to get badges, so they can get be part of the BiS Klub. That's why Gearscore was abused and people couldnt get runs, and it's why PUGs are dominated and cockblocked by the same players who require gear that is way over what drops in that raid or dungeon. Anything previous to what is currently BiS is an annoyance and an inconvenience, and that's the mindset that ruined LFR and has driven the anti-lfr crowd. <br />
<br />
That's why I don't think the devs really understand their customers, or are willfully ignoring them to maintain this fiction that players are there for things other than purplez and badges (or whatever the currency is). Nobody is going to run anything unless they get a direct benefit. They know that's what drives players - the grind. Nobody runs content if there's no reward - and few, precious few see the experience of the fight or the grouping with other people as a reward. Most players see other players as tools to get what they want, and that's it. Yes, there are friends who play, and play together, and that's the important thing, but they're far and few between these days. <br />
<br />
The devs are designing for a class of player that doesn't exist anymore. GC's comments really show that. And, perhaps that's why he left - maybe he knew/saw it was a losing battle to 'GOGOGOGOGO&quot; and &quot;Why do I have to be &quot;forced&quot; to run LFR/LFG, my time is too important!&quot; and &quot;LFM Must have AHTC and level 900&quot; (for level 700 content).</div></div><hr />

So what if large segments choose to play that way. The raids are interesting a couple times to see them, but the gear chase for BiS is a temporary thrill at best which is overwritten every xpac. Many players seem to be far more involved in the larger world outside of current raids, either enjoying alts, pvping, or racking up transmogs.</div></div><hr />

N'zoth is in the ocean, not Tristfal.</div></div><hr />

I also wonder if trolls will get doom raptors instead of wolves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I worded that incorrectly, I didn't mean N'zoth was in Tristfal, I was stating that out of the 5 old gods, N'zoth was the 4th not third to be revealed and that the only old god not revealed yet is the buried underneath Tristfal.</div></div><hr />

Bliz have said what is under Tristfal was not an old god.</div></div><hr />
