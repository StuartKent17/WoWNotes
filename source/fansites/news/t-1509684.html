<br />
<br />
Flying in Warlords of Draenor<br />
Will flight be available at some point in warlords.<br />
Ok, ok, being perfectly honest... we don't know. In the same way we have no idea what the gearing model for the final tier of the expansion could be, because it's going to be based on testing, and playing, and seeing how the expansion plays out up to that point. We're open and willing to change the game as we go to make it the best it can be.<br />
<br />
We don't know because we're open to feedback, and making changes based on that feedback. <br />
<br />
Our current focus is to get the expansion into a state where you guys can help us start testing it. That testing will inform many, many decisions, and how the game plays when it's launched will inform how the first content patch is designed, and how that patch plays out will inform the second content patch, etc. etc. We'd rather be unsure and make the correct decisions when they need to be made, than make the wrong decisions and be too stubborn to change them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor PvE Changes<br />
It's important not to skip over the Group Finder section! It'll help everyone, regardless of their current focus, be able to find and create groups for content:<br />
<br />
Another central innovation in Warlords is our Group Finder feature, which will allow players to easily form and search for raid groups (among other activities) with players from their entire region. While this series of blogs has mostly focused on pre-existing social structures, pick-up groups continue to be tremendously important. Chance meetings in such groups have formed the basis for many a friendship, and recurring weekly pickup groups have given rise to more than a few guilds over the years. For players who want to take the next step beyond Raid Finder, or who want to find a weekend run for their alt, or who just need a last-minute tenth member for their raid, Group Finder will make that process easier than ever before.<br />
<br />
To your concern: It took me a very long time to even be able to be considered for flex runs and whatnot on my server due to the super high standards every group leader seems to have.<br />
<br />
One pretty cool factor of the Group Finder tool will be that people won't be able to start groups and require things of others they themselves have not achieved. Such as requiring an ilvl higher than what they themselves currently have.<br />
<br />
The new Group Finder will be something everyone has access to, it'll allow all players within an entire region to easily find each other, which will make it a very active place to find groups, and we hope through some smart options and rules, getting into organized group content much, much easier for everyone.<br />
<br />
Have you ever seen people this upset BEFORE AN EXPANSION WAS ACTUALLY RELEASED? Usually players are happy and excited for a new expansion!<br />
I've been in Community for every World of Warcraft expansion, and yes, it's the same every single time.<br />
<br />
People are always concerned with changes, and concern is fine, and we'll communicate our intent, and you'll tell us how well you think it'll work out, or if it seems like a good or bad idea for you and how you play the game, and we'll have a beta test where we figure all these things out, and we'll make adjustments, and decisions, and etc. etc.<br />
<br />
It does tend to be a bit more upsetting before actual live testing begins. We announce changes, we put info out there, it's confusing, it's out of context a lot of the time, and it just is generally when our least productive feedback comes in. When testing actually begins and people can play the game and see how it's working, that's generally when things calm down, people see the results of these changes, there's context, and we can get into the nitty gritty testing and balancing.<br />
<br />
But yes, I've seen people upset before every single expansion for the last 10 years. Mainly because saying &quot;I'm so excited!&quot; isn't much of a conversation starter. &quot;This will ruin the game forever.&quot; tends to create more responses and threads.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Will you address things like blood presence and defensive stance in pvp. Having to sit in them to live is no fun in pvp<br />
Those stances provide an interesting interaction between going offensive/defensive. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/453628930419744769))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
&quot;Camouflage no longer breaks from dealing or taking damage.&quot;How can this possibly be a thing?<br />
It can be! As with many other changes we're making, it's somewhat experimental, and we'll adjust if it's too strong. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453430142606385152))<br />
The 6 second in combat duration makes sense, but if you use it once before entering combat. 60 seconds of ranged immunity?<br />
No, it'll drop to 6sec on entering combat. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453431706742038528))<br />
<br />
How many new hunter pets are there going to be in WoD? How many of them will be exotic?<br />
3 new families, 1 of which is exotic, and many new models/skins for existing families. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453437510861848576))<br />
<br />
hey, any word on Careful Aim become a passive or active talent? http://t.co/HNYH9mNuKX<br />
Sounds like some sort of misinterpretation. There's a couple Draenor Perks that massively increase the power of Careful Aim. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453848327486832640))<br />
It's stronger than many other classes' cooldowns. But it's staying a Passive, no intention to make it an Active. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453848643267600384))<br />
<br />

FoF glyph will be mandatory for raiding like RsK minor is now. Disagree w/fixing design flaws by restricting choice<br />
My prediction: Some encounter will make 3 other glyphs particularly strong, and someone will begrudgingly try going without... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453421556148883456))<br />
...Floating Butterfly. And after learning that fight thoroughly, they'll start to recognize when they can FoF without having... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453421717013024769))<br />
...moving, and realize that &quot;Huh... It's harder, but maybe we CAN do without this...&quot; And it'll start to be used ~half the time. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453421982046896128))<br />
<br />
Will Path of Mist talent drop orbs when using Chi Torpedo? Can those orbs be used with detonate chi?<br />
Yes. Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453422330484490240))<br />
<br />
which class do you personally feel have had/needed the biggest rewamp, and why? Hard to decipher from a long list <br />
Mistweavers, definitely. Talked about a lot in their section. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453675472027516928))<br />
<br />

Any thoughts on the idea of making Colossus Smash a talent? There's so many of us that hate how it changes our rotation -_-<br />
To make sure I understand, the concern is with feeling like you always need to pool resources and then unload during CSmash? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/453314442063646720))<br />
<br />
Without Recklessness and Execute Perk (50%) are Gladiator Stance Warriors going to be tuned to keep up with Arms/Fury?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/453632522790789120))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
How come we haven't seen 3D armor like that(like boots) for players yet?What was the reason?Is it possible for WoD?<br />
Items for players are different, and need to fit on every race. With NPC armor, it's literally part of his geometry. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/453034028203917313))<br />
I see, thanks for that. Was wondering if it's possible to add more geosets, or even see anchored armor cheers<br />
It's something out art team (and engine team) are working towards, since we agree it'd be awesome. Not yet, though. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/453060426285076480))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
what about timeless coins? i seem to have a ton but have bought everything i wanted from vendors<br />
Coins are staying island-fresh. Spend them on gliders, masks, and pug hats! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/453337347677896704))<br />
How about rep? No chance of it going the way of the troll rep when raid was converted ?<br />
Staying around, you can always go back and kill more Ordon (or kill FOR the Ordon) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/453337726691991552))<br />
<br />
Just to make sure, all four CM Phoenixes can't be obtained on a single character, right? I'd need to do silver on 3 alts? <br />
Incorrect -- in 6.0 if any character has earned one, your entire account will get all 4. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/453756421792727040))<br />
<br />
any word on what the reforge mount will become? Thanks <br />
The leading contender is transmog. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/453765648196186112))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Hey, you might not be the right person, but I was curious - for the stat squish, how much of it is a manual process for Blizz?<br />
Most of it was done programatically. We do need to manually adjust a number of creature spells, though - that work is ongoing. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/453620669737992193))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Will there be any stepping nerfs to SoO like in previous final tiers?<br />
Not planned in light of multiple difficulties, item upgrades, and a smooth tuning curve. Is there a boss you think needs a nerf? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/453791333371498496))<br />
<br />
Cool. Have you figured out a way to add dungeons in patches? You spoke about it at Blizzcon but didn't have any set plans yet.<br />
Still something we want to do. Focused on making 6.0 awesome first, then we'll turn to patch content. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/453924074494775296))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
hey long ago there was pic of dota1 map for BG can you say if it will come in WoD?<br />
It will not come in Warlords. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/453609947880620032))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Is there any plans to give voices there own slider in audio.1/2 the time i can't here what the npcs r saying over the spell spam<br />
It's something we'd like to do, hopefully for 6.0 but if not, then soon after. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/453556764613423105))<br />

<br />
You can (mostly) find out by changing the gender / race in the modelviewer. It looks like underwear aren't disappearing properly, but other than that it works!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hate when people speak for a majority. To me atleast, it's a perfect kit for Arms, not so much for Fury (pool rage and unleash hell for 6 seconds, rinse and repeat). Doesn't fit a berserker flailing around with gigantic axes.<br />
<br />
Are there plans to give hunters a new CD to fill the void left by the removal of Rapid Fire?<br />
No we were intentionally removing the number of cooldowns.<br />
<br />
These might be late tweets. They are planning on bringing back Rapid Fire for MM.</div></div><hr />

Again. And again, cloth armor looks like leather as well. First LFR gear, now this... They are made of fur and leather. In case of second armor - green version you could at least pretend it's grass and leather, but it still isn't cloth. I know they want to make everything SAVAGE, but don't make armor look like something it isn't to achieve that goal. The only cloth armor that actually looks like it's made of cloth is the crafted one so far.<br />
<br />
Also, the shoulders of the first one look humongous on female characters and the second one looks ridiculous on Forsaken. I hope Warlock tier keeps high quality at least. The one released so far looked nice.</div></div><hr />

Clown suits in Wrath/Cataclysm/Pandaria? Yeah, no, in these expansions quest rewards formed aesthetically complete sets instead of totally random models of TBC gear. Most of the time there is only one or two sets per expansion as well. So do old world quest rewards after the revamp, but they have 4 or so different sets, changing every few dozen levels.<br />
<br />
They looked fine enough. Cataclysm had pretty good cloth set, MoP's one was aesthetically pleasant, although not really my think, and WotLK one looked good enough. First of all though, they looked like cloth. These here &quot;cloth&quot; sets look like leather and fur. Last time I checked leather and fur are not the same thing as cloth. Especially in a game that has a specific armor category of &quot;Leather&quot;. And it's not only an issue of Quest. Armor. The exact same thing applies to &quot;cloth&quot; set of LFR, which is raid armor. Mail and leather, both quest and LFR, are also off. This is crap design and laziness on Blizzard's part if they can't be even bothered to make SAVAGE looking cloth made of cloth and instead have to make it from SAVAGE materials. The only cloth sets that looks like actual, genuine cloth is the crafted gear.</div></div><hr />

Yeah...maybe. It's just that the whole caveman-look with better stats than anything else is such a deal breaker for me.

<br />
I can't speak for everyone, but I certainly had a clown suit while leveling, in every expansion. The pieces are there, sure, but between dungeon drops and different quest rewards, you're not likely to end up with a complete set. Even if you do, do people transmog while leveling? I don't see the point.<br />
<br />
And while you can disagree with Blizzard's aesthetics to your heart's content - I do more often than I don't - I don't see how that translates into laziness. The Cloth armor does seem to be bordering on leather, but why would it be easier to design leather armor than cloth? That's not laziness, it's just a conscious design decision.<br />
<br />
As for Leather and Mail, I don't see the arguments. You can plainly see the scale armor on the mail sets.</div></div><hr />

WOW. Such grammar. Much English. Ahem - people buying TBC greens has NOTHING to do with leveling up lol - they buy them because they're disenchanting them to level up their enchanting (which, is totally idiotic as you can go run a couple normal mode BC dungeons and walk out with 10-20 greens).<br />

<br />
Healing model is not being reverted to Cata model. Healers will not oom and fights will not have super high crazy damage and poorly telegraphed, hard to react to one-shot kill mechanics. Those were the actual issues in Cata. How do I know this? BECAUSE I HEALED IT.<br />

Not at all. They look hideous. I just can't manage to get excited about WoD. I think LFR providing different gear is fine and less stats is fine too, but it needs to look just as cool as a PvP set or a Raid set, just different. To be fair though the Raid sets and PvP sets look like ass too. Seems like everything look so uninspired, like the designers have run out of ideas.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mehrunes</div><div class="date">2014-05-02, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't speak for everyone, but I certainly had a clown suit while leveling, in every expansion. The pieces are there, sure, but between dungeon drops and different quest rewards, you're not likely to end up with a complete set. Even if you do, do people transmog while leveling? I don't see the point.<br />
<br />
And while you can disagree with Blizzard's aesthetics to your heart's content - I do more often than I don't - I don't see how that translates into laziness. The Cloth armor does seem to be bordering on leather, but why would it be easier to design leather armor than cloth? That's not laziness, it's just a conscious design decision.<br />
<br />
As for Leather and Mail, I don't see the arguments. You can plainly see the scale armor on the mail sets.<br />
<br />
Then the same could be argued about raid gear. Until you get a full set, you still have the previous tier's one. Or in case of first tier, dungeon/quest reward/reputation/crafted gear. Moreover, the off pieces you may get can be lookalikes of different spec. In your case, since as far as I'm aware you play a Paladin, you may end with some gear that completes DK/Warrior set instead of paladin one. TBC questing gear was dubbed clown gear because even if you wore quest rewards only, you were hard pressed to find two items that at least had the same colour, let alone matching theme.<br />
<br />
And it's not about transmoging during leveling, but after leveling. If the quest set is nice, why the hell not? I used Cata crafted set as my PvP transmog for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Also, it's not that leather is easier to design on it's own. It's SAVAGE leather that's easier to design than SAVAGE cloth. Think about it, this whole SAVAGE theme stems from focus on Orc society before the start of Warcraft. A society of hunters and warriors. When they don't wear heavier armor for combat, they chill around in leather and fur clothes. With bones and tusks. Bonus points to SAVAGERY if it's from Draenor's SAVAGE wolves. Makes slightly less sense when you realize there's only one cold area on the continent, but Blizzard doesn't let such details phase them. <br />
<br />
So instead of trying to make cloth armor look remotely savage in any way, they just made it leather and fur. On both quest sets and LFRaid set. But as I said, crafted gear looks great. Only the helm is off in my opinion, but there are alternatives. And I saw dungeon sets on WoWHead today, also nice. Also made of cloth.<br />
<br />
I'll give you that the second mail set has some scale armor visible on legs, sides and arms beneath all that leather and fur. But it's still tons of leather and fur. LFR set and the first quest set have even worse mail/scale armor to leather/fur ratio. Same goes to leather. The second quest set has more leather, but the first one and LFR set are covered in metal from head to toe. The proportions are off.</div></div><hr />

Of course, it would be nice if they showed them on another race/gender, derp face human models are not great for showing how they look.<br />

i laughed out loud when i read that question.<br />
<br />
People have been consistently upset to ridiculous degree's for every expansion and major patch for the last 10 years.<br />
<br />
Infact WoD has had less than usual. there's no real Venom yet but the expansion has plenty of time to arrive. in the oncoming months, we'll be seeing some reactions that finally match up with all the QQ and complaining that went on before all the other expansions released</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not %100 clear on the whole process. But I imagine by shooting they mean camera work. May not be counting CGI, music/sound production and all the editing it takes to overlay that, piecing everything together, all the advertising and hype build up, etc etc. All the real work.<br />
<br />
And those quest sets are.. meh idk. Can't help but feel this Panda expansion has polluted WoWs art style permanently now when i look at them and that saddens me. The tier previews from awhile back look incredible at least, so that gives me hope.</div></div><hr />

Fits the more tribal theme of the Orcs IMO. And even though Draenei haven't been on Draenor for nearly as long as Orcs, I think it would be cool if we had a few pieces of armour fitting Draenic culture.</div></div><hr />

There is most likely a LOT of visual effects work that needs to be done; they also give themselves time to do reshoots if necessary and then its up to the studio to pick when to release the film (as far as I know it doesn't have a set release date yet). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as the quest armor goes, its really sad that it looks a lot better than the LFR gear. Shit on LFR all you want, but the guys who created the LFR armor should be embarrased.</div></div><hr />

This is lame. I haven't preordered, and am still teetering on the brink. Honestly, I don't need to fly that much. On the other hand, it's stupid and I hate rewarding stupidity. I do enjoy raiding, but don't remember the last time I actually enjoyed leveling in an expansion. Blah.</div></div><hr />

I like how any time Blizzard does something objectively wrong because your opinion is gospel these days it's due to 'laziness' and nothing else. Looks like yet another word losing its meaning, like 'troll' or 'rehash'.<br />
Nonetheless, flying is an inexorable part of WoW's gameplay and it'd be a crying shame to see the entirety of WoD go by without it, but I don't get most of the blind complaining seeing as how we know they're designing the environment and alternative forms of travel around that sort of limitation.</div></div><hr />

It's a five-month shoot (started filming in January) with a year and a half of post-production. That's a longer shoot than average for a big budget movie.<br />
<br />
Post = visual effects, editing, pickups and reshoots, ADR, foley, scoring, etc.<br />

I know, it keeps getting harder and harder to read these forums. Even in this thread, 80% of the posts are just from people crying about something stupid or making ridiculous claims. It makes it painful to read and impossible to have any type of discussion. There is another wow fansite that has much more appropriate discussions without all the shallow negativity. I wish the mods would crack down here and get back to discussion forums rather than just a bunch of 12 year olds posting one-line and reusing the same catch-phrases.</div></div><hr />

And again with the stupid comments. If they have everything planned out in advance, then you think the fact that Timeless Island had no daily quests was pure coincidence and not a reaction to the negative feedback from the 5.0 dailies?<br />
<br />
lol Â´cost analysis of removing flyingÂ´ Really? you think some guy with an MBA is up there doing a 10 page paper on how many subs they will lose or the risks of removing flying? Here is their analysis Â´ no flying will make questing and the open world more engaging and funÂ´. I am not sure if you noticed this, but every game is having the same debate, and even games like Wildstar the devs are saying their wonÂ´t be flying because of the same reasons the WoW devs want to keep it away from new content. There is no Â´cost analysisÂ´.. there is simply a gameplay analysis that the devs made. The same way they decided the reforging wasnÂ´t good for the overall game, they decided that flying wasnÂ´t good either.<br />
<br />
The devs are pretty smart too. NOBODY is not going to buy WoD because of Â´no flyingÂ´. I want to start a thread of people who have active accounts now who say they arenÂ´t going to buy WoD the first day so we can watch armories.</div></div><hr />

Smells like the opinion of someone that likes being lazy. <br />
<br />
There are plenty that prefer no flying mounts, and I bet it is enough that they will not change their minds based off dollars earned. Having ground mounts only will force people into the world again, re-open the world PvP possibilities, and let us use mounts that I have collected that I have not been able to use for some time. <br />
<br />
My opinion is I don't see them holding out for more than two patches on flying just because in both Cata and MoP we had it before the end of the firet teir.</div></div><hr />

Ultimately flying (or not) is more likely going to be a feedback thing, but only if the feedback is overwhelmingly negative otherwise Blizz will marginalize it as much as possible to force players to kill their way through mobs/go along THEIR preferred route. Wont be surprised if a Blue answers to a player that theyre having problems farming mats to give the rather sympathetic &quot;Have you used your garrison yet? Its very useful for a wide variety of activities including gathering mat&quot; or the already given flightpaths, because surely those will be fixed in WoD right? Riiiiiiiiiiiiight.</div></div><hr />

I know World of Warcraft has it's own stylized graphics style and I love it to death but whereas the overall game, the graphics of the zones, monsters, NPCs, the new character models etc.. The armour design, look and feel hasn't matured much at all. They just feel lacklustre, and that's not because of the overall flimsy design of many of the sets. It's more because of the severe lack of actual detail making cloth, leather, mail and plate into a mush. There is no real distinction between them, even with it's stylized graphics there should be a way to make this armour sets and equipment more pronounced and make them actually feel more like cloth, leather, mail and plate.</div></div><hr />

We are a casual and half-progress guild.<br />
<br />
Half of my guild will buy next expansion when they will allow flying again on the re-textured Outland. <br />
Wasting more time for get a deposit or herb, always dead fly masters, endless genking, empty boutlgrounds... etc.<br />

If am I not mistaken they &quot;knew&quot; with all other expansions about flying (I could be wrong). But this expansion it's &quot;don't know&quot;? I'm confused on why they just don't say like they did before. I've got a sinking feeling that one of the things I love about WoW is going down the drain. meh<br />
<br />
I think people are getting things wrong as why this is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
It's not about being lazy or anything like that. It's making what could be a tedious task not so much of a chore. I get the whole thing about needing the challenge of fighting through mobs and all that, but when you have to get through the very same mobs again and again after it's proven that they provide zero challenge other than to keep you from farming that node you wanted, it becomes less and less about that and more about forcing a play style on others without either thinking or even caring about the consequences. If I want to farm a node and do what I would usually do to grey/green mobs (run past them), and then see a node I want, what ends up happening? I can't farm it until I kill the mobs under most circumstances, and in that time, an asshat can come in and just steal it because I had to kill something I didn't necessarily need to, or would've had to would I be able to just fly over them to not aggro something.<br />
<br />
It's something EVERY player enjoyed once they paid the gold and got the mounts to take advantage of it. So why do people complain that other players did something that they had just as much right to do?<br />
<br />
And it's not even just about that. This decision stinks of catering to elitists. What other decision will they do to cater to them?<br />
<br />
In closing, this is not an announcement they made at Blizzcon. Something tells me they didn't think they would get a whole lot of cheers for this. If they were more sure that people would receive this positively, they would've made this announcement at Blizzcon. I don't expect the responses to be very good for the decision (most aren't so far), and I expect that they will possibly change their decision. The way they did it in MoP (where you couldn't fly until max level in the continent) worked fine and it was received well, and it was a very good reward (as with many RPG) for getting to that point in the game where not much in the overworld can really challenge you. Not sure why they felt the need to fix something that wasn't broken.</div></div><hr />
