When you enter the key from your Collector’s Edition, we will see the original transaction on your account and the credit will kick in. Remember, you will need to enter the Collector’s Edition key before the end of the year, as automatic Blizzard Balance credits will be turned off at 11:59pm PST on December 31, 2018.<br />
<br />
Please note, if you bought a standard edition then upgraded to a digital deluxe, you will be credited for the original copy only.<br />
<br />
Standard Digital / Digital Deluxe &gt; Collector’s Edition<br />
If you bought the Standard OR Digital Deluxe copy of Battle for Azeroth and pre-ordered the Collector’s Edition, your Blizzard Balance credit will be the price you paid for the original copy.<br />
<br />
Standard Digital &gt; Digital Deluxe &gt; Collector’s Edition<br />
If you bought the Standard digital copy, upgraded to Digital Deluxe at a later date, then pre-ordered the Collector’s Edition of Battle for Azeroth, your Blizzard Balance credit will be the price you paid for the original Standard Edition.<br />
<br />
*Both stories will become available online later this year, but buying the Collector’s Edition will remain the only way to own the exclusive hardback version containing original artwork.</div></div><hr />

The point of getting the physical Collector's Edition, is to get the physical items. Therefore making the soundtrack a digital download, rather than a physical CD seems rather daft. And, not including a dedicated art book... I would wager the art book is one of the main reasons people get the Collector's Edition.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't include it, just so that they could bring it out later on and charge people for it...</div></div><hr />

What is going on?!<br />
First you stop printing posters for CE, then quality of CE boxes itself became as one of the sh*tty CE boxes I've ever seen, now we've been cut to no artbook/soundtrack/mousepad...<br />
So what's inside then??<br />
Before there was a book, few cd cases with game and soundtrack, cards, pad - now it's two booklet, mark and... box? For a same price I guess?!</div></div><hr />

Sorry to say. No dedicated artbook, no physical CD, no behind-the-scenes DVD. Those are the reasons I buy these.<br />
<br />
On top of that, the price is hiked up an additional $10 over the Legion CE, probably because of the emblem that I don't care about.<br />
<br />
The illustrated hardcover novellas sound neat, but that's not enough to get me on board, especially since they'll be available digitally later.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Even if they have a dozen exclusive illustrations, it's not at all the same.<br />
<br />
Each CE artbook has close to 200 pages of concept artwork for its expansion, including cinematic concepts, environment art, and concepts for characters, creatures, and gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically you're giving up the hardcover artbook for an illustrated hardcover novella, and you're giving up all the other physical goods (BTS DVD, Soundtrack CD, Mousepad) and forking over an extra $10 for a digital soundtrack download code and a big Horde/Alliance emblem on a stand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The coin adds value as you can not get it anywhere else (at least you better not be able too) and will later help me decide if I go alliance or horde in future expansions :P</div></div><hr />

Same here mate, same here. Plus the Behind the Scenes DVD was always a good draw for me, even if they've gotten worse over the years. The lack of a mousepad (even though it's a minor thing) really sucks, and not having a physical soundtrack is also a let down.<br />

Looks like I'm passing on the CE for the first time since I started buying them. :(</div></div><hr />

Bleh! No artbook? Yeah, this might be the first CE I pass on.<br />
<br />
Wonder if they'll release an artbook separately, later? I'd buy that in a heartbeat. The concept art for BFA so far is amazing. But no artbook, no CE sale.<br />
<br />
Man, I held off on ordering the expansion and unlocking the allied races to wait for this, what a bummer! Guess I'll do that now though.<br />
<br />
I literally take out the artbook and throw the rest of the shit away. lol</div></div><hr />

I already store literally hundreds and hundreds of CDs that I don't want to trash but also will never actually play in that form again. The soundtrack should have been digital or on a USB drive from the start honestly. I get that it's a physical box, but does anyone actually play CDs in a CD player anymore? Usually I'm the last person to surrender old tech so if I'm over it, I'm very surprised that others would still be hanging on.<br />
<br />
Don't care about the mousepad. The behind the scenes DVD is cool but not every year has had that anyway.<br />
<br />
The lack of artbook really sucks though since that, along with the soundtrack, are the main reasons I buy the CE. I give zero shits about Warcraft story (sorry lore junkies) but I love the art a lot. The book is always my favourite part of opening the CE box. Maybe the other book will end up being cool and with enough original art that it will be fine, but I'm still pretty bummed about that.<br />
<br />
Also very glad they've improved the system for upgrading to a CE. In the past the process has been beyond stupid. Why it took them this long to figure it out I'll never know, but I'm glad they've done it.</div></div><hr />

With that logic they could just stop doing physical collectors editions alltogether. Also CD is not really a dead medium. I don't want to pay that much money just for a download code. You could just wait and rip the soundtrack out of the game yourself for that :p</div></div><hr />

In the fine print:<br />
&quot;*Both stories will become available online later this year, but buying the Collector’s Edition will remain the only way to own the exclusive hardback version containing original artwork.&quot;<br />

It helps to read the info and don't just look at the picture. The &quot;CD&quot; you see is a piece of cardboard with a download key on the back so you can download a digital version of the soundtrack.<br />

With DVD i would agree, there's a hefty difference in DVD vs Bluray. Which is why they also put in Blurays for the Behind The Scenes stuff. But CDs are no different to a digital file. It's just less expanses for them. But what does that say about the CE? There's less stuff in it for a higher price. That's bullshit. They were expensive because they came with a lot of stuff, of course everyone values the content different but they removed like 4 things (i don't really care for the mousepad for instance) but only added 2 new things and raised the price!? No thanks.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but that is removing value. Why print an artbook / novel then? Just include a download code to a pdf with text and pictures? Soon nothing physical but some gimmick will be left in the physical collectors edition?</div></div><hr />

As someone mentioned earlier you did lose the ability to have the music in lossless quality. So now you will have compressed music. Personally I don't do much with the physical items other than display them. I want physical items because I find value in having a physical item rather than a digital item. It sucks that they removed so much and yet still increased the price. Thank God I have GCU with Best Buy as I would not pay $100 for this CE.</div></div><hr />

I don't expect it to be in any other language than english. Wich it sucks. I have absolutely no problem reading english, but for whoever can't read it, it has almost no value. That's why I think the book art was way better: almost no text (and the existing one was short and simple descriptions), lots of art that everyone can apreciate regardless of language, you couldn't get it any other way (if I'm not mistaken)...<br />
<br />
Now with this book you have a novel expected only in english (it'll be a great surprise if they make a collectors book for each language, wich I hardly doubt), the same book you could get later sans the pretty presentation.<br />
<br />
I don't think this CE is cheaper for Blizzard (it probably is more expensive), but I think the former model had more value for costumers outside US.</div></div><hr />

So $100 bucks for a collectors edition with no Artbook or mousepad. Am I reading this right? <br />
So from what I see they are charging more for some digital items that have nothing to do with the game we are paying for.<br />
<br />
Hearthstone<br />
Azeroth is Burning Card Back<br />
<br />
Heroes of the Storm<br />
Primal Flamesaber Mount<br />
<br />
Overwatch<br />
Tracer Alliance Banner &amp; Horde Banner Emotes<br />
Torbjorn For the Alliance &amp; For the Horde Emotes<br />
Zandalar &amp; Kul’Tiras Icons<br />
Anduin, Jaina, Sylvanas and Varok Sprays<br />
<br />
StarCraft II<br />
Alliance &amp; Horde Sprays<br />
<br />
On top of that they are locking story content that should be in the game within a book. Story content that is separate from the other 2 version being sold now in which I think they are both overpriced as well. Unless I'm mistaking and this is going to be in the game. <br />
<br />
Ever since Cataclysm the content for each expansion has been getting smaller and smaller with the cost going higher. As of right now players are paying to play on 3 zones. Yes 3 zones. Not 6 because the opposing factions 3 zones don't count. I'm talking about picking any character and playing the zones. If I remember correctly the Burning Crusade I played through 7 zones and Wrath of the Lich King was 9 zones. These zones can be played by any side and the collectors editions cost less than $70 bucks.<br />
<br />
The came Cataclysm with the world revamped adding an additional 4 zones. This is where Activision steps in and the games downward spiral commences.<br />
Mist of Pandaria with 7 zones next comes Warlords of Draenor with 4 zones for with an extra zone for each faction making it 5 each. Now we have Legion with the least number of zones which is 4 released at launch. So since Wrath of the Lich King there has been a 75 percent reduction on game content. Blizzards excuse that players are going through the content fast has nothing to do with the player speeding through the game but the number of playable zones lacking within each expansion. We are getting shafted by this company to pay more for less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a little confused by your post, Do you pay for leveling, or do you pay for end game content? but end game we get all 6 zones, and I'm ok with leveling in only 3 zones, it was annoying as shit to go to 5 different zones to level, ya, it was cool that you could choose where you went, but not cool that each one took forever, and you had to do most of them to do the balance of power questline, Also these 6 zones are massive, the 3 for each faction seem as big if not bigger than the broken isles combined.<br />
<br />
as far as the CE content is concerned, honestly I feel like I'm only paying $30 extra for the coin, the novell (with original artwork), and the sound track, the hearthstone card and all that stuff are meh, but I feel the book alone is worth more than $30 as it has an actual story with original artwork in it.<br />
<br />
Also these 6 zones are massive</div></div><hr />

Mist of Pandaria with 7 zones next comes Warlords of Draenor with 4 zones for with an extra zone for each faction making it 5 each. Now we have Legion with the least number of zones which is 4 released at launch. So since Wrath of the Lich King there has been a 75 percent reduction on game content. Blizzards excuse that players are going through the content fast has nothing to do with the player speeding through the game but the number of playable zones lacking within each expansion. We are getting shafted by this company to pay more for less.<br />
<br />
the book will be released online later, but the artwork that is in the haredcover wont be released.<br />
so the story will be told, just for those who buy this get it on paper, and with artwork.<br />
also i hate to say itbut you have to remember how inflation works...<br />
yes the collectors edition cost less and had more years ago... but that was years ago...<br />
i remember when you could buy a large bag of chips for a buck fifty, now its a small bag for a buck seventy five.<br />
also btw you do play through 6 zones, also really are we counting zones now? would you be happier if blizzard released 150 zones, each with 1 quest each? we are getting more, and higher quality quests per zone in the past so who cares about zone count.<br />
<br />
Also Wotlk you really counted every zone? Wotlk yes had 9 zones, but icecrown was max level and was pretty much empty until a later patch, and wintergrasp was a pvp zone with little content in it for just normal players, and if you count crystal song... ho boy all those 3 quests.<br />
but again you cant count just zones, or else blizzards next expansion would have 200 zones with 1 quest each, then you would be a million times more happy right?<br />
do some research, the zones are only slightly smaller then places like outland and northrend, but are also much more packed, remember all that COMPLETLY useless space in dragonblight, icecrown, and storm peaks?<br />
<br />
I find it weird you make this thread about the collectors edition shitting on the zones, when zones have done nothing but get bigger and better, yes there is less, but they are better, have more quests, have more interesting quests, and more packed instead of a flat plain of ice with 4 mobs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can honestly say that whilst I got the CD from previous CE's, I never played them. Why should I when it's so much smoother to just get the songs digitally?<br />
The story book will come with official, unique artwork which won't be available to those without the CE.<br />
The token is a nice bonus, was not expecting it. Far better than another mouse-mat that I won't be using. <br />
<br />
The mount and pet being available to everyone buying a digital copy is not something I like, but alas... Perhaps one day, they'll return to having at least a unique pet for those of us dedicated enough to get the physical CE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The art book change to the &quot;exclusive hardcover story&quot; thing is a bit strange, but come on people, its 2018, why print cds, you don't keep up with dead media just cause. If the original boxes had come with a VHS would expect a damn VHS in 2018? Most people don't even HAVE a cd player anymore.<br />

I still have my Mars Attacks! limited edition VHS with T-shirt...</div></div><hr />

When you enter the key from your Collector’s Edition, we will see the original transaction on your account and the credit will kick in. Remember, you will need to enter the Collector’s Edition key before the end of the year, as automatic Blizzard Balance credits will be turned off at 11:59pm PST on December 31, 2018.<br />

<br />
<br />
A few years ago I would agree, but not now. Why? Because if plenty of people are going to buy it, then Blizzard will notice that they don't have to try anymore and will just require more and more money for less and less work.<br />
<br />
Same thing happened to game industry, now there are plenty of P2W games, because people are buying things that give them advantage. There are no longer competition(like in sports), but just who has more money - has more power in certain games. I always was reffering to games as some kind of sport(where only skill matter), but yeah... To be honest I'd do the same. That's the sad side of reality nowadays.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can honestly say that whilst I got the CD from previous CE's, I never played them. Why should I when it's so much smoother to just get the songs digitally?<br />
<br />
I'm not an audiofile, but I liked putting these CDs in my stereo. Not very often, but that happened a few times.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The story book will come with official, unique artwork which won't be available to those without the CE.<br />
<br />
<br />
How come? Are they going to send me that book? Or they're going to put it on their website and someone would just screenshot it and post here... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The token is a nice bonus, was not expecting it. Far better than another mouse-mat that I won't be using. <br />
<br />
I agree, that token looks actually pretty well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm probably still going to buy physical CE, just for the collection.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't going to, but those novella snippets are red fucking hot. I prefer concept art over illustration, but if there's a 'looot' of it...<br />

<br />
Wait as always. That's Blizzard's point of buying the physical collector edition: you want physical extras you wait. That's why we have a Digital Deluxe in counterpart. But this time physical CE is disapointing for the wait.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been collecting the WoW Collectors Editions for years now, I have them all except for vanilla WoW, which at the time I didn't know they were selling... <br />
This is the first time that I will not buy the CE.<br />
A real shame Blizzard. So disappointing.</div></div><hr />

The novel is a copout. That shouldn't be the kind of thing put in a CE. And the medallion thing looks cheap and nasty.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are really disappointing atm. Actually not Blizzard as a whole, the WoW team.</div></div><hr />

I'm really concerned it's going to be an iTunes code - all of Blizzard's digital albums are iTunes exclusives. I've had physical copies of all the others and, frankly, I'm pissed that they're not giving a physical copy. Save the environment, use less plastic, I'm all for it, but if it's going to be potentially locked behind iTunes, and subsequently only usable on iTunes, it's a total waste.<br />
Also noartbookwhatthehell?!<br />
<br />
CD and art book and the sole reasons I buy the CE and have done since WotLK (I started playing in BC :B)</div></div><hr />
