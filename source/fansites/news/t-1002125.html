I slightly explained that on Reddit, but I'll explain it again because I have nothing to hide. <br />
<br />
There's no secret agreement with Blizzard, Curse, or my mom to make sure I won't leak anything, but I think a lot of people forget the meaning of the word &quot;fansite&quot;. I have absolutely no interest in ruining the Blizzcon effect just to get the news up 20H earlier. I would do it if another site decided to fire the first shot (and that's what happened last year, people just forgot/never knew how things went exactly) but I have absolutely no interest in leaking it right before Blizzcon just for the sake of fucking with Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I created the site because I like Blizzard, and it's still the case and I have absolutely no incentive to messing with them. The +10 or +20% traffic boost really isn't worth being a giant asshole. <br />
<br />
Also, the ramp-up/excitation is basically the only &quot;OMGOMGOMGOMG&quot; moment you'll have, when/if the opening ceremony announces something, the official websites will be up, you'll spend 30 mins on it and most people will go back to complaining about it on forums.</div></div><hr />

Either he is smuggling in a bottle of water or he is SUPER excited to be at BlizzCon.<br />

Levels 85-90 <br />
Expansion gives players access to the wartorn island of Pandaria, Kul Tiras, Tel'abim, and Suramar. <br />
Two distinct Pandaren races are released with the game. <br />
The Alliance befriends the Pandaren of the Shadow Shao'din, a proud clan of warriors with a heritage of bloodshed. <br />
The Horde gains the support of the Fire Shao'din, which is a clan of Pandaren monks, scholars, and poets. <br />
Civil war split the island of Pandaria literally. The two warring Pandaren clans used their magic to split the island down the middle. <br />
Shodo-pan Zin Ji is the stand-in villain for the expansion, but N'Zoth and Azshara play a role, as well. <br />
Shodo-pan Zin Ji is the former leader of the Shadow Shao'din, and initially receives support from the Alliance. <br />
The Shadow Shao'din started the war by invading Fire Shao'din farms to steal food and supplies. <br />
The Shadow Shao'din is too powerful for the Fire Shao'din to handle alone. The Fire Shao'din sends messengers in a rowboat to a nearby Horde warship to plead for support. <br />
The &quot;Mists&quot; of Pandaria are actually a concealing sort of magic that hid the island from the eyes of sailors for millennia. <br />
The Fire Shao'din Pandaren are markedly friendlier-looking compared to the Shadow Shao'din Pandaren<br />
. The two races are very distinct from each other. The Fire Shao'din Pandaren have a choice of sagely beards and wise facial features, while the Shadow Shao'din Pandaren are slightly taller and appear more vicious. <br />
Blizzard wanted to give the Alliance another &quot;unethical&quot; or &quot;shadowy&quot; race to balance the storyline out. <br />
The expansion focuses greatly on the conflict between the Alliance and Horde by proxy of their new Pandaren allies. <br />
Deathwing's Shattering is what initially caused famine and disease to consume the island of Pandaria. The Shadow Shao'din took a very direct approach to handling the problem, and this meant wiping out the sickly members of the population in large numbers. The Alliance does not initially understand the brutality of the Shadow Shao'din. <br />

Why?. Honestly dont understand the hate behind Pandarens. If they were my little pony creatures that run up to your screen like a Furby purring &quot;Me ruvvv wooo&quot;...then i would be up in arms.<br />
<br />
But a bloodthirsty clan of Pandaren warriors/monks who have mastered the elements and have a plausible identity and place within the game...bring it on! :D.<br />

Well, I didn't mean entirely. If they come into the game in some capacity I would welcome it, but they should not be the main theme of an expansion. Especially not this playable race for both sides stuff I keep seeing people post. That would be just plain ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

Normally by now you would have a page full of information about the coming expansion. Have blizzard really kept it a secret?<br />
<br />
Please read at page 2 (or was it 3?).<br />
He says that he may have information (He hints to that he kinda got it but gives no promises) but says that if he have it, he wont be an ass and spoil right before blizzcon. He ONLY spoil IF someone else spoils, there really isnt more than that to it.<br />
<br />
Imagine how it is, not only for you, but also for blizzard, if half the audience (maybe more?) knows everything beforehand. That would be just lame. Blizzcon is much funnier when they make announcments there instead off at fansites.</div></div><hr />

Sadly my only computer class at school might not coincide with the WoW expac news... But I think MoP will be the Expac. Although I don't think Panadaren will be playable. They'll be in-game in my opinion but not playable I say this expac is all about Azhura, and N'Zoth. Anyone else getting the player housing vibe or alternate advancement like in EQ? They did say in a blue post that they wil now focus harder on end-game content to keep players interested. I just have a feeling this Expac will blow my mind! Ugh tomorrow is sooooo far AWAY!</div></div><hr />

Levels 85-90 <br />
Expansion gives players access to the wartorn island of Pandaria, Kul Tiras, Tel'abim, and Suramar. <br />
Two distinct Pandaren races are released with the game. <br />
The Alliance befriends the Pandaren of the Shadow Shao'din, a proud clan of warriors with a heritage of bloodshed. <br />
The Horde gains the support of the Fire Shao'din, which is a clan of Pandaren monks, scholars, and poets. <br />
Civil war split the island of Pandaria literally. The two warring Pandaren clans used their magic to split the island down the middle. <br />
Shodo-pan Zin Ji is the stand-in villain for the expansion, but N'Zoth and Azshara play a role, as well. <br />
Shodo-pan Zin Ji is the former leader of the Shadow Shao'din, and initially receives support from the Alliance. <br />
The Shadow Shao'din started the war by invading Fire Shao'din farms to steal food and supplies. <br />
The Shadow Shao'din is too powerful for the Fire Shao'din to handle alone. The Fire Shao'din sends messengers in a rowboat to a nearby Horde warship to plead for support. <br />
The &quot;Mists&quot; of Pandaria are actually a concealing sort of magic that hid the island from the eyes of sailors for millennia. <br />
The Fire Shao'din Pandaren are markedly friendlier-looking compared to the Shadow Shao'din Pandaren<br />
. The two races are very distinct from each other. The Fire Shao'din Pandaren have a choice of sagely beards and wise facial features, while the Shadow Shao'din Pandaren are slightly taller and appear more vicious. <br />
Blizzard wanted to give the Alliance another &quot;unethical&quot; or &quot;shadowy&quot; race to balance the storyline out. <br />
The expansion focuses greatly on the conflict between the Alliance and Horde by proxy of their new Pandaren allies. <br />
Deathwing's Shattering is what initially caused famine and disease to consume the island of Pandaria. The Shadow Shao'din took a very direct approach to handling the problem, and this meant wiping out the sickly members of the population in large numbers. The Alliance does not initially understand the brutality of the Shadow Shao'din. <br />
<br />
If I get this right, you guys owe me a sandvich!!! (Unconfirmed Leak)<br />
<br />
<br />
That is not real, but even if it was I would not make sense. The Alliance would align with the Fire Panderans, not the Shadow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Klasis</div><div class="date">2011-10-21, 12:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why?. Honestly dont understand the hate behind Pandarens. If they were my little pony creatures that run up to your screen like a Furby purring &quot;Me ruvvv wooo&quot;...then i would be up in arms.<br />
<br />
But a bloodthirsty clan of Pandaren warriors/monks who have mastered the elements and have a plausible identity and place within the game...bring it on! :D.<br />
<br />
Different strokes for different folks, but yeah i for one am excited for this Blizzcon...no matter what the announcements are<br />
<br />
SOON!<br />
<br />
We are ok with murderous pandas, but we find Addicted elves to be 'gay' and many people have problems with them. In your own words &quot;Honestly why?&quot; Well here is an answer... Some people like somethings, and others like other things. We dont all need to like pandaren. I mean cool they are bloodthirsty, but they are just not appealing to me at least. While I wont mind if pandas are in this xpac, I certainly hope they are not the main focus....</div></div><hr />

well alliance aren't really the good guys in wow, lore wise anyway. all in all the horde are probably more peaceful than the alliance or at the least the factions are equal in good deeds and bad deeds<br />
the alliance just paint themsleves pretty which is pretty hard for the horde to do since they all look fairly monsterish.</div></div><hr />

<br />
•	portals added to all main cities and not just SW and Org. (never understood in the first place why they were forcing everyone to the same spot again. As if they didn’t learn a thing from the Laggrath and Lagaran problems) <br />
•	A fast way of travelling between the cities. (going from IF to Darnassus for example) I am tired of having to rely on mages. What was wrong with the Dalaran portals? <br />
•	Path of the titans or something alike, something to customize/flavor your character. <br />
•	A way of making archeology and fishing interesting.<br />
•	SC2 part 2 information.<br />
•	Releasedate of Diablo 3 <br />
•	An mount added to the legendary dagger set (let’s be honest, shadowmourne and Dragonwrath had it, and Dragonwrath can be used for a mount instead of collecting dust in your bank when a next patch or expansion hits) People were disappointed when they realised the wings was not a flight form. •	Class changes that makes my rogue no longer clunky to play. <br />
•	A new hero class. Doesn’t matter what it is <br />
•	4th talent tree and/or a separated tree system for pvp vs pve. Would finally solve the bloody class imbalances and screwing over one part for the sake of the other. <br />
<br />
What I expect : <br />
<br />
Nothing really. I don’t want to be disappointed so I won’t set expectations.</div></div><hr />
