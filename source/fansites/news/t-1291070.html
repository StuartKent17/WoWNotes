Oondasta and Nalak Loot Eligibility Change<br />
Back in early March we made a hotfix to remove loot and bonus roll eligibility for players that defeated Oondasta and Nalak while visiting from a different realm. At the time, the change was made to address realm stability issues. Since then, we’ve address those issues by making tuning adjustments for Oondasta such as increasing the spawn rate, and reducing Oondasta’s health by 50%.<br />
<br />
In an upcoming hotfix, players coalesced from a different realm will be eligible to receive loot or use a bonus roll after defeating Oondasta or Nalak once more. Keep in mind, players are still only eligible to receive loot or use a bonus roll once a week.<br />
<br />
This change will take effect in each region after their scheduled weekly realm maintenance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mogu Rune of Fate – Lesser Charm Change<br />
We’re deploying a hotfix late tonight that will reduce the number of Lesser Charms of Good Fortune required to purchase 3 Mogu Runes of Fate from 90 down to 50. Meaning when you log in Wednesday and purchase your 3 Mogu Runes of Fate, which are used for 5.2 raid boss bonus rolls, it will only cost you 50 Lesser Charms.<br />
<br />
We recommend waiting until after the scheduled Wednesday maintenance to ensure this change has gone through before purchasing your Runes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.2 Hotfixes: April 22<br />
Creatures<br />
<br />
Players coalesced from a different realm are now eligible to receive loot or use a bonus roll after defeating Oondasta or Nalak.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Mogu Runes of Fate (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/752-mogu-rune-of-fate): Reduced the number of Lesser Charms of Good Fortune (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/738-lesser-charm-of-good-fortune) needed for the Mogu Runes of Fate weekly quest to 50, down from 90.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Throne of Thunder - Twin Consorts<br />
<br />
Cosmic Barrage (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/136752-cosmic-barrage) now summons 4 Crashing Stars (down from 6) on 10-player Normal, Heroic, and Raid Finder difficulty. 8 Crashing Stars (down from 12) are summoned on 25-player Normal and Heroic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/95347.jpg Sinister Primal Diamond (http://www.wowdb.com/items/95347-sinister-primal-diamond) should now correctly have different activation rates depending on the class and specialization. In addition, activation rate for Fire Mages has been increased.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Pet Passive Changes<br />
We're going to be buffing some pet passives in a future patch, and elementals are on the list. We feel that the elemental passive is currently too confusing in that it is somewhat ambiguous with regard to direct effects of weather, but not effects that are not directly related to weather.<br />
<br />
For example, if your opponent has a pet that gains an additional attack in a Blizzard, they will still get the additional attack against your elemental pet. This can feel bad in some cases and we want pet passives to always feel good and useful. We also feel that weather is one of the more fun and synergistic elements of Pet Battles, so at this point in time, we’re thinking of redesigning the elemental pet passive along the lines of a ~50% reduction in damage for the turn one is swapped in. Our goal being that we’d rather have a passive in place that increases the strategic depth of elemental pets, and is clear in its intention and functionality.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, we’re still evaluating the numbers and everything is subject to change, but we’d sincerely appreciate any constructive feedback you may have! <br />

Patch 5.3 Experience Changes<br />
How will it work...<br />
<br />
Scenario 1:<br />
<br />
Before the patch: Character has 50/200 xp, xp bar shows 25% progress to next level.<br />
After the patch: Character has 50/100 xp, xp bar shows 50% progress to next level.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario 2:<br />
<br />
Before the patch: Character has 102/200 xp, xp bar shows 51% progress to next level.<br />
After the patch: Character has 102/100 xp, and will level as soon as they gain an experience point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me know if that helps. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/259121-53-mop-xp-lowered-please/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8569150117?page=9#173))<br />
<br />
World PvP and Gear<br />
That is referring to world PvP. In world PvP, those in full Conquest gear &quot;should be pretty competitive with a Heroic raid–geared player—they may have more survivability, but you might do more damage.&quot; In instanced PvP, such as Arena and Battlegrounds the player in PvP gear will have an upper hand, and the player with PvE gear has the better equipment for dungeons and raids.<br />
<br />
I hope this clears that up, the devs are referring to world PvP specifically and not PvP in general. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/259259-ask-the-devs-possible-pvp-change-53/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7356256172?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Ask the Devs Questions<br />
Mobius, to answer your question as to why your question was not taken: <br />
<br />
Any changes planned for DKs? Like removing the rp cost from Icebound Fortitude or removing the health loss every 2 sec from Unholy Frenzy. <br />
As you can see, the question is not about the planned changes for patch 5.3. For those that are complaining that you aren't satisfied with the questions we responded to, take into consideration the following things:<br />
<br />
Did you ask a question? We only took questions that were posted in the Ask the Devs thread. If you don't ask, we can't answer. Was your question about the patch 5.3 changes relating to PvP? If not, then it was not taken because it broke one of the first rules for the Ask the Devs Did you up-vote questions you wanted to see answered? The highest voted questions were the ones we chose.<br />
<br />
There were many questions that were able to be asked about the 5.3 changes for PvP. There was a new battleground, a new arena, many class changes that would affect PvP and as can be seen, resilience changes. No questions were avoided, if they met the rules of the thread and were voted for, then they were chosen.<br />
<br />
The major things which are constanly posted about here and on the usa forums: too much burst, too much cc +remove the pve trinkets, are simply ignored. <br />
There are actually responses to all three of those. The Devs spoke about CC, the PvE trinkets and the burst they create. Unfortunately, if you check the Ask the Devs thread, there are no questions which actually asked about the 5.3 changes and the way in which they would address burst, outside of those pertaining to the Shado-Pan trinkets. If you wanted an answer specifically to the ways in which 5.3 was planning to address your particular issues with burst, then you should have asked them.

Tier 15 Interview With Method<br />
Manaflask has once again interviewed Method about their thoughts on this tier of content. You can see the hightlights below, or read the full interview on Manaflask (http://manaflask.com/en/articles/the-throne-is-method-s-a-post-t15-25-man-victory-interview).<br />
<br />
<br />
10 and 25 player difficulties are different races due to the different difficulty of the bosses in each size.<br />
Due to the difficulty differences, Method no longer feels like they are directly competing against Paragon anymore.<br />
The lack of any gating was nice, as was the longer period of pure progression. <br />
The boss tuning was well done in this tier, with the exception of Twin Consorts (which was hotfixed).<br />
Lei Shen was well tuned, well designed, and one of the better encounters in the game.<br />
Ra-den was significantly easier than Lei Shen, and really was a bonus boss rather than the &quot;final boss&quot; of the tier.<br />
The opinion on limited attempts on Ra-den was split, with some guild members liking it and some disliking it. <br />
Everyone agreed that Dark Animus was the most frustrating boss due to the wipes early in the fight.<br />
Method raided 14-16 hours a day during much of the progression.<br />
<br />

For example some items that would give them an upper hand like a pot or a special bandage that heals more, or just even an item that boosts their Damage/HP for some seconds. This is because while in the world, the PvE geared players have a much higher advantage against mobs/quests while the PvP'ers have a minor advantage against PvE players.</div></div><hr />

Its one of the things where Boub blatently LIED to the community of MMO-C, that his merge with Curse wont affect newspost. But since BL is being sponsored by Curse, you'll always see BL videos and interviews here first, even if they arent even worth it.<br />
<br />
And honestly, tell me again that TIME is not the top requirement to be a &quot;top raider&quot;, Riggy. 16h a day... gz for your &quot;awesome&quot; achievement, hahahahaha.</div></div><hr />

Yes, no doubt. It's their site and they'll post whatever they want, but it just makes no sense to me they waited so long to put the videos on the news, waiting for BL's release.<br />

Usually guilds have the right to post whatever they want, because you know, they've killed the boss and earned full rights to release a video.<br />

Racism? I haven't seen any. Not here anyway, but if you do see it, the proper thing to do would be to report it. In any case, this is a Tuesday news post, and as you can see there really isn't much in there. The videos were all put out yesterday, but instead of making smaller posts, we just put these out together to make a nicely sized news post. Seriously people, there are no conspiracies, racial preference, continent bias, or hidden agendas.</div></div><hr />

Yep and it turned out to be another boring bossfight. Nothing we haven't seen before in the last 8 years... Why be creative when you are making billions of dollars anyway right?<br />

And honestly, tell me again that TIME is not the top requirement to be a &quot;top raider&quot;, Riggy. 16h a day... gz for your &quot;awesome&quot; achievement, hahahahaha.<br />

So what complicated algorithm is used to decide who gets featured on the front page? How much money people send to my personal paypal account? How many trucks full of cookies they drive to my door? How many cute fluffy hippo plushies they give me? Those are all valid suggestions, but we go with kill order instead. <br />
<br />
Top guilds have this vague rule of not spoiling encounters too much before a couple of guilds died, I'm not really sure it benefits the community to reward the people who can rush a video the fastest instead. I don't see why a guild should be penalized because they held their video for 10 days after their kill.</div></div><hr />

Russian is neither a race nor an ethnicity, it is a nationality. If you called them slavs, then it would be racist. You can't be racist against a country, it even says so in your link to Wikipedia.

Because it was the first one to be released. By the time MMO-C posted these 2 on the frontpage, everyone and their grandmothers already saw the Exorsus one. <br />

I really dont know under what circumstances you've grown up, but atleast in the European Union the hatred towards a country is considered racism. It is generalizing, racial prejudice or discrimination.. call it whatever you want, but stop justifing or tolerating this BS.<br />

One of your mods said so. I honestly dont care, but I can remember seeing BL videos on the frontpage even if they werent second or third. I'm not really sure if it benefits the community if a website like this rewards guilds who insult other guilds openly on MMO-C and under their youtube channels by releasing their videos.<br />

And lol, 14-16h rading per day and not even world first on Lei Shen? Holy fuck, there are guilds out there that raid 3-4 days per week and are close to clearing the content.

No, these guys claim to be &quot;the best in the world&quot; when that's obviously not the case. If they were, they wouldn't have to spend all their waking hours in a raid to be able to clear it, people with normal lives and normal raiding hours who are now at 10 or 11 heroics are actually much more skilled than guilds like method who, not only spend 1 month and a half actually living in a raid to be able to comprehend the strategies, but even started earlier than actual progress by spamming the encounters on the ptr.<br />
<br />
Now I'm in none of these cases as I play casually, it simply boggles my mind that anyone could think that these guys who have to spend their entire life in a raid to understand it are actually good. They're at the upper most &quot;persistent&quot;, but certainly not &quot;good&quot;.<br />

I'm very sure, that when you limit every guild in the world to 12h/week the ranking would be the same. Every limited boss in the history of WoW has the same guilds at the top. Even instances like ICC where the hard bosses all had limited tries had the same guilds at the top. But it would be really interesting to see the amount of tries each guild needs for every boss PLUS a complete NDA on any tactic. No video, no guide until the top 100~ have killed the boss. So every guild has to develope their own tactic and the guild with less tries is obiviously performing better.</div></div><hr />

Following you argument, everyone who is exceptionally good with something due to long and hard practice, is not worth the approval, because they needed so much time to practice. It's like saying, an exceptional good piano player, that practices about 8 hours a day (and believe me, they do), is worse than some guy out there, who only practices 4 hours a day and who is playing quite nice. <br />
<br />
There is only one method to measure the rank of a guild quantitatively, and that is by kill order or progress speed. No one can really say what would happen, if Method was only allowed to play for a certain amount of time per week. No one would tell an athlete to only workout or practice their sport with a constraint, that would be kind of strange, right?<br />
Well, one can say what happens, if a guild is only allowed a certain amount of tries per week, I think we have seen that this tier.<br />
<br />
And I really like if someone says, a guild can post whatever and whenever they want on their channel/page and in the same post gets upset about a newssite, that does not post exactly the news this person wants to be posted. :)<br />

This has got nothing to do with learning a skill as complicated as playing piano, this is wow, this is a video game, you can learn how to dps competitively with any class and any spec just by reading a forum, I'd like to see you learn to play piano by reading a forum post...<br />
<br />
So this is what it has come to? Skill is measured by time spent? <br />
<br />
You see, with your analogy, I'd think someone who learned piano in a few days is much more talented than some guy who had to spend months on end learning the same skill.<br />
<br />
This is the same thing for world first, some guilds invest literally their whole life for a given period of time to get the prize, when most people aren't ready to sacrifice their whole irl life and jobs just to be first, and probably even if they could, wouldn't understand the point, this screws the measure.<br />
<br />
This is a world first only in the sense that they are competing with guilds who have the same playtime available, and that's certainly not a whole lot, so yeah, grats to Method who got their world first in competition with what? 2, 3 other guilds?<br />
<br />
So what? A guild that plays 5 times less often than Method but still clear the content in only a couple of months? Fuck them? They actually spent a shitload less time in the raid than Method, but because Method were willing to sacrifice their IRL, they get the &quot;best players&quot; tag, when other guilds cleared the content with significantly less time invested?<br />
<br />
So, basically, for wow progress: time invested = skill ?<br />
<br />
So yeah, grats to Method for having invested 500+ hrs of play time in less than a couple of months, them and BL are probably the only guilds in the world who could be bothered to spend so much time in there. <br />
I just think this whole world first thing is so overblown: some guys spend their life in a raid so now they have to be acknowledged as the best? This is so wrong in so many ways I can't even be bothered to continue commenting.<br />

I'm personally (and we've suggested it to Blizzard too!) looking forward to the patch where they will implement 'Challenge Raids'. <br />
It will require a lot more class balancing though - stacked raids will be requirements even more so than is today when aiming for that fastest time!<br />
<br />
I do still see it as two different things - both race to world first and 'challenge' raids will be something to keep people busy!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, you don't have to like it, but obviously this massive amount of time investment leads to a kind of success, a very big part of the wow community is interested in. And yes, one can learn a certain amount of 'skill' by playing in one of the world-first competitive guilds. Maybe you are one of the exceptionally good players - I myself always thought the dps of the players in the top guilds were far out of my league, never figured out how they got these high numbers, and I also read a lot of theorycraft and elitistjerks etc. I have to admit - I was never raiding on the cutting edge.<br />
<br />
If you want to approve the, in your eyes, 'more talented' players, then you are free to do so. In the end however, it is always the piano player who has the greatest skill who is most successful and fills the great halls, no one will ask if he spent decades or only years to obtain that skill. The problem is, you have absolutely no idea, who is really the 'most talented' player. You can only assume, that they are in different guilds than the top ones, you can never be sure if that is true. Maybe the time you need to invest to down a certain boss increases exponentially with the progress speed for whatever reason (gear requirement or shear concentration issues)? Who knows?<br />
<br />
Maybe you can try and find an algorithm that takes into account your issues, like '(tries needed)*(time spent)' or 'killtime*(time spent)²', but there will always be a way to optimize your ranking value in a way that has little to do with 'talent'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to the world of MMOs. I don't where you have been, but its always been this way. Those who play the most get the most. They are first because they put forward the investment of time to get there. Playing devil's advocate, it could be claimed that these OTHER guilds you mention only are able to complete the same content because someone else figured it out and posted how. <br />
<br />
Your coming off so jealous its hilarious. Trying to paint Method in every bad light you can, got to love the SACRIFICE IRL. Really dude? If they have the time to do this its not a sacrifice. Maybe YOU would have to sacrifice to spend the time they play but apparently given their history of play this is normal every day fun. I know people who have taken vacation time to play games at launch, clear new raid content, and more. I don't, but I certainly won't find every little whiny excuse under the sun to claim that someone's accomplishment isn't what it is. Face it, they were FIRST. <br />
<br />
In any race your either first or your the loser.</div></div><hr />

BTW: You really can´t compare a professional Piano player or a professional athlete to a &quot;world first&quot; gamer because it is a different thing they try to achieve. You know an athlete spends a lot of hours to practice so that he can win championships, medals and other prices and a professional Piano player practices so that he can play in-front of a very big crowd and to write new songs. So tell me what does a &quot;World first&quot; gamer that plays 14 hours a day achieve with this? All they achieve is to be featured on a few gamer sites and maybe get a few fans. They don´t get medals or money a Piano player or athlete would (the best of them because those guys in these guilds claim to be the best too).<br />
<br />
So if you try to compare the best athletes to the best &quot;raiders&quot; then you see that all those top raiders do is spend their entire life in a game trying to down a boss for a bit of fame on a gaming site. They do not earn millions or world-wide fame with it like the best athletes do.</div></div><hr />

Like I said. This is only comparable if every guild has to develope their own tactic from scratch and we count the tries. Then we will see if a world top 100 guild is better than a world top 5 guild and the world top 5 is only top because of time investment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, but this is your issue. If you can't understand the motivation of people who want to be the best in a competition, then it is not the fault of the 'world-first' guilds. Once again - feel free to not approve the achievements of those players. On the other hand, I think it is kind of sad, that the only valid motivation in your opinion seems to be money.<br />
<br />
Maybe the sportsman or the piano player ends up earning a lot of money, but I assume, only very few start doing a sport or playing the piano with the intention to become famous and earn a lot of cash. Everybody tries to improve themselves in the things he does - some take it a step further and try to become the best. This is absolutely not limited to musical instruments or sports, you can see this in nearly every aspect of live. Have you ever read a little in the guinnes book of records? There is a whole bunch of records, noone would ever pay them money for. Those people only did it for the fun and to become the best in their respective area.<br />
<br />
Whenever there is a possibility of competition coming along with a broad base of people to compete, there will be people who try to maximize their success and become the best, no matter if there is any prize to win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People often try to downplay how much they have to sacrifice, though. Granted, none of us are in the shoes of a world first raider, so we don't know what their personal lives are like. But if you are raiding that much, something else has to be sacrificed for it. I love this game, but I'm not so sure those sacrifices would be worth being &quot;the best&quot; at a game. Riggnaros always talks about how to be &quot;the best&quot; at something you have to produce results, come up with new ideas, etc. Wouldn't all of those skills be better served in an outlet in which career and financial opportunities are involved? You can still raid 12-15 hours per week and clear content while it's relevant. There's plenty of guilds on WoW Progress that prove this. I wonder what those guilds who raid 20-25 hours per week and still lose to 12-15 per hour week guilds think when it happens.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tekloth</div><div class="date">2013-04-23, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has got nothing to do with learning a skill as complicated as playing piano, this is wow, this is a video game, you can learn how to dps competitively with any class and any spec just by reading a forum, I'd like to see you learn to play piano by reading a forum post...<br />
<br />
So this is what it has come to? Skill is measured by time spent? <br />
<br />
You see, with your analogy, I'd think someone who learned piano in a few days is much more talented than some guy who had to spend months on end learning the same skill.<br />
<br />
This is the same thing for world first, some guilds invest literally their whole life for a given period of time to get the prize, when most people aren't ready to sacrifice their whole irl life and jobs just to be first, and probably even if they could, wouldn't understand the point, this screws the measure.<br />
<br />
This is a world first only in the sense that they are competing with guilds who have the same playtime available, and that's certainly not a whole lot, so yeah, grats to Method who got their world first in competition with what? 2, 3 other guilds?<br />
<br />
So what? A guild that plays 5 times less often than Method but still clear the content in only a couple of months? Fuck them? They actually spent a shitload less time in the raid than Method, but because Method were willing to sacrifice their IRL, they get the &quot;best players&quot; tag, when other guilds cleared the content with significantly less time invested?<br />
<br />
So, basically, for wow progress: time invested = skill ?<br />
<br />
So yeah, grats to Method for having invested 500+ hrs of play time in less than a couple of months, them and BL are probably the only guilds in the world who could be bothered to spend so much time in there. <br />
I just think this whole world first thing is so overblown: some guys spend their life in a raid so now they have to be acknowledged as the best? This is so wrong in so many ways I can't even be bothered to continue commenting.<br />
<br />
To me, the world first now has little more meaning than &quot;these guys have litteraly no life&quot; à la South Park, rather than &quot;these guys are so ubber skilled&quot;...<br />
<br />
<br />
You seem to forget the main tool for progress apart from skill; GEAR. These top guilds clear content multiple resets before anyone else and thus with worse gear. They down bosses in much worse gear than in which the boss was designed to be killed. Even now, multiple resets later some people who have just cleared normal struggle with HC Jin'rokh. For example; My raid has much better gear than what Paragon had when they started their 10man HC clears, yet my raid still struggles with the same bosses that Paragon downed with much, much worse gear than what we had.<br />
<br />
Take for example Ulduar: For Ensidia, hardmode Hodir wasn't killable with just the gear they had, they had to use their wits to come up with something that would work, and the result you can read here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/646642-Ensidia-Down-Hodir-the-hard-mode). Yogg-saron +0 is another perfect example; deemed mathematically impossible, yet suddenly some taiwanese guild called Stars appears out of nowhere and manages to barely kill the boss with barely seconds to spare. How's that not skill and is only about investing more time than others?<br />
<br />
Also, you can learn how to DPS by reading forums, yes. But you simply can't match the dps what the top guilds are pulling just by reading forums. You need to learn your class inside out and play it like it's your second nature if you want to be as competitive as those guys. Pulling off the perfect rotations while looking out for boss timers, stuff on the ground and the possible adds included in the fight isn't something you can do without knowing your class and just by reading forums.<br />
<br />
And no, this isn't restricted to only top guilds. Every guild can have one or more good dps that tops the charts on a certain boss, but still the guild can struggle because the others aren't putting up the same numbers or are learning the fights more slowly, or are just more prone to screwing up multiple times on the same thing. An event which doesn't happen too often with the top guilds.<br />
<br />
You can argue all you want, but it's not just about the time that they invest in it, but also about individual skill and teamwork.<br />
<br />
To conclude this, let me throw you a question, and be honest; with the gear you and your guild currently have and will obtain in the future, do you think you would be able to clear the entire raid on heroic within the next 4-8 resets? Time investment shouldn't come into play there anymore if you think that all bosses are easy and just by investing a bit more time than the rest you're able to get the kills first.</div></div><hr />

They are going for Wolrd Firsts. It doesnt matter if its in a video game or any other category. <br />

It's like saying, an exceptional good piano player, that practices about 8 hours a day (and believe me, they do), is worse than some guy out there, who only practices 4 hours a day and who is playing quite nice. <br />
<br />
There is only one method to measure the rank of a guild quantitatively, and that is by kill order or progress speed. No one can really say what would happen, if Method was only allowed to play for a certain amount of time per week. No one would tell an athlete to only workout or practice their sport with a constraint, that would be kind of strange, right?<br />
Well, one can say what happens, if a guild is only allowed a certain amount of tries per week, I think we have seen that this tier.<br />
<br />
And I really like if someone says, a guild can post whatever and whenever they want on their channel/page and in the same post gets upset about a newssite, that does not post exactly the news this person wants to be posted. :)<br />
<br />
(sorry for my english, not a native speaker)<br />
<br />
That's a bold statement there. <br />
<br />
The reality is like the guys says, if you play this game 16 hours a day for two to three weeks you are bound to actually finish the tier somewhere near the top, just because instead of 20 attempts at a boss you get 100-200, that's called brute forcing really. There's guilds in the top 200 (including mine) who are now 11/13 with as little as 4 hours a raid night with 3 raids a week - and that's like not really too far off from the top guilds, at 12 hours a weeks vs. 112 hours a week for the top guild (if we assume 16h x 7day) - just picture that, just do it, it's insane amount of time spent no wonder they make 10 times faster progress. <br />
<br />
The dedication of the &quot;top&quot; guilds is certainly admirable and I personally don't deny their success or envy them in the slightest, but you have to understand that they are at the top simply because their members chose WoW in front everything else (school, work, family) for as long as the content is not beat, not because they are the best players. <br />
<br />
Personally I couldn't deal with such a schedule, I got work to worry about and a family, 3 raids nights at 4 hours is the most I'm willing to invest into this game and even that is much some times - does that mean I'm less skilled? I certainly don't believe so, it just means I'm not investing the same amount of time, and there's tons of players out there equally skilled or even higher, that can not commit to the schedule of top raiding guilds.</div></div><hr />

That's true for every videogame probably, the more time you spend on learning the mechanics the easier it gets... This also true for every moba and PvP game. The only times this is not true is when there is a lot of RNG involved, then luck comes to play.<br />

The difference in other games is that you have to spend all those hours to GET to the top....what I mean is you can't be a top player in a game like sc2 or dota by playing only 3-4 hours a day. It's literally impossible because those are high skill cap games. In a game like WoW on the other hand its very easy for someone who plays 3-4 hours a day to be at the same skill level as someone who plays 15-16 hours a day. This is where the time vs skill argument comes in. I suppose we can say that having the endurance and dedication to put that many hours in is a type of skill but different than what we think of in traditional terms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if this is a serious statement -- however -- the number of attempts on a boss being used as a metric to skill doesn't make sense. Maybe between the guilds who did it the first week or so, but once strategies start becoming available and the raids overall item level increases, the attempt numbers start meaning less and less. <br />
<br />
Is it really right to spit in the face of passion? Method, Blood Legion, whatever, are incredibly passionate about something. Who are you to judge someone on what they enjoy. Many great artists would forgo hygiene and social interactions for months to indulge what they were passionate about. Obviously they aren't hurting for money if they can afford to raid these ridiculous hours. Sometimes friends you meet online can be more fun and interesting than the people you know in real life. It's really shallow to judge people in such superficial ways.<br />

With the in-game raid guide, where it explains exactly what each ability of the boss does and the testing on the PTR prior to release, strategies become less and less of a concern. They were once viable, when there was no dungeon journal and similar stuff, but pretty much every boss right now has exactly known abilities ('cept maybe for Ra-Den, even that was datamined I think) and it comes down to raid composition pretty much, you want one additional tank or more healers, everything else is like an open book - and you fiddle with that until the boss dies. <br />
<br />
The poster you are quoting is basically right, even tho condescending and rude in nature, I don't know anyone in my surrounding that would be willing to spend ~100 hours a week on a video game. That said I'm in my 30s, so my surroundings are also somewhere there, and that's when you got other stuff to worry about and a game is a past time not something you invest everything in. I could take 3 weeks of work, but I certainly wouldn't want to spend it all on a game, some sure. <br />
<br />
That said, I don't think I could have invested that much time even when I was a kid, my parents would kick me to school or force me to do homework, or when I would be in a faculty, I could probably spend more time on the game but nowhere close to that, so what those guild invest is borderline to being a social misfit - and really an cause for alarm to their parent and friends. <br />
<br />
We're not talking bout money here, money can be earned and spent, I should know that, my other hobby except for gaming is remote control models, and I spend a shit ton of money on that, a RC model can costs up to $3000 (haven't bought one that expesnive yet), it's insane I know, but I earn and spend my money, however even whilst gaming and this other hobby I don't spend nearly close to the time this guys/girls spend in WoW alone. <br />

Nobody spends that much time on anything, a week has 168 hours and they spend 112 hours of that said week only on that game, that is insane - do you think Usain Bolt, Michael Phelps, Sebastian Vettel, you name it spend close to 100 hours a week training and preparing for their next competition? And those guys actually make millions and millions of what they do - it's just insane - that's not how a human body functions. <br />
<br />
As said above, I admire their dedication but don't envy them a bit, and personally I don't think investing that much time on something is normal, if this would be by kid, I would have unplugged the internet long ago.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Freese</div><div class="date">2013-04-23, 05:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure if this is a serious statement -- however -- the number of attempts on a boss being used as a metric to skill doesn't make sense. Maybe between the guilds who did it the first week or so, but once strategies start becoming available and the raids overall item level increases, the attempt numbers start meaning less and less. <br />
<br />
Is it really right to spit in the face of passion? Method, Blood Legion, whatever, are incredibly passionate about something. Who are you to judge someone on what they enjoy. Many great artists would forgo hygiene and social interactions for months to indulge what they were passionate about. Obviously they aren't hurting for money if they can afford to raid these ridiculous hours. Sometimes friends you meet online can be more fun and interesting than the people you know in real life. It's really shallow to judge people in such superficial ways.<br />
<br />
I wish I were as passionate about anything in life that these people are... it must be nice to care about something that much.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone is criticizing these raiders for their passion. I think that most just look at the amount of hours they raid and try to imagine how that raiding schedule would fit in with their own personal, busy schedules. We don't know what each life of a World First raider is like, so it's unfair to make assumptions for sure. We can safely argue, though, that if someone is spend 12-16 hours per day raiding for a few months out of the year (please also remember that most WF guilds do the PTR testing, which often occurs during normal business/working hours), something else is being sacrificed.<br />
<br />
I do think that your artist analogy is somewhat flawed because, presumably, that artist is working towards getting paid for his or her art. Raiders are not getting paid, nor will they anytime soon. In the future, I strongly believe that professional gaming will happen on a bigger scale, but not now. If anything, these raiders are just helping pave the way for future gamers to make a living off of their hobbies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Phelps trains around 8h-10h a day before events like olympia, if i can remember correctly. BUT, he does that nearly &quot;every&quot; day a week for SEVERAL years (okay, let's go for 5 days a week). I was a triathlete back in the day. And I trained more time a week than I'm raiding right now. 5 day training a week, 2-3h each day, no training around christmas, but the rest of the year, and up to 2 competitions per weekend, and I was not at pro level, I was not even close. The training was need to succeed at a fairly low level. The really funny part is, even if you train this much you will not get any money. Most people at olympia do the sport in their spare time, and work the other time. Because people getting paid anough to life purely on sports are very rare (at least in the sports that are not super popular like soccer, etc). When Method is back to 1-2 days a week after 2 weeks of progress these guys still push the limits. Every. Day. <br />
<br />
Or look at other games, like Starcraft 2. The Koreans pros train up 10-12h a day, EVERY DAY. Not just for 1-2 weeks every 4 month. Okay, it's their job, but people spend much more time on much things than method spends in WoW. Much. More.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what complicated algorithm is used to decide who gets featured on the front page? How much money people send to my personal paypal account? How many trucks full of cookies they drive to my door? How many cute fluffy hippo plushies they give me? Those are all valid suggestions, but we go with kill order instead. <br />
<br />
Top guilds have this vague rule of not spoiling encounters too much before a couple of guilds died, I'm not really sure it benefits the community to reward the people who can rush a video the fastest instead. I don't see why a guild should be penalized because they held their video for 10 days after their kill.<br />
<br />
Actually Bob it's pretty clear that chaud is quite biased regarding his 'news' posts about guilds, some people can be fooled but not all of us. The structure and timing of the 'news' posts about guild kills and videos across all the current tier in general are quite hilarious to say the least, the 'news' appear as soon as BL does something thou the same cannot be said about other guilds. At first chaud posted only videos of BL even if they didn't got WF (Primordius and Dark Animus) the excuses for doing so goes from 'BL released the video first' and 'Method is sponsored by a competing site' first claim is null since by the time he posted the video Method already released theirs also if the trend was to post the first released video then Exorsus Ra-den video should had been posted in this news thread, second claim is just false and even if truth I don't see the harm on it since MMOC always provided links to said site. Now my guess is that chaud realized that the community wasn't buying all this BL favoritism posts and he adopted a new tactic, since BL wasn't getting any WF or releasing any videos first, he just waited and waited for when either a BL video or kill happened and posted it together with the guild who got WF and released their video first, GENIUS! Now if hes featuring 2 different guilds why not 3, 4 or 5 as well?<br />
<br />
There was a time that front page news used to reward the guild who deserved it the most with their 5 minutes of efame, now it all seems to be about the guild who got more 'connections' to MMOC staff.

They must be getting paid massively well.<br />
<br />
To the guy worried about video order: This has to be the first tier in a very long time that Paragon didn't already have their video ready, just waiting for 2nd and 3rd kills to come in. At that point, they would post their video, and the other ones would post theirs.<br />
<br />
Are we doing a world first for kill video now too, or something?<br />

Look at his loot table. Nothing worth breaking your neck over. He's basically a bonus loot pinata for people who killed heroic Lei-shen.<br />

A lore-tease if you will. That's all this boss is. The loot and achieves are there just to make you want to kill him.<br />

I struggle to just complete some parts of raid finder these days, i log on wow 5 minutes later i log off as i do not have time anymore,nevermind 16hours of trying to kill a few bosses,thats insane, i used play wow for 7 hours a day and raid or try to raid for 2 hours and even hanging around in mumble i did not have the patience of waiting knowing that i could spend my time elsewhere. <br />
Now i got a job and a girlfriend i go out more i cannot be bothered with wow and im more happier than ever,i look to the past of my old sad 7 hour wow days and facepalm.<br />
I do feel sorry for big end raiders that dedicated 10+ hours a day to this game.they have no respect for themselves.they will also look back to the past one day and also facepalm and think *why did i waste all that time/life on a game when i could of done something/achieved something else/important in life.<br />

You can even have a gf if you're a bum begging for money in the local mall. Of course they've gfs, since they also play WoW with them... well, dunno why I even care about them having gfs, but I doubt they've one who is not in the slightest interested in gaming.<br />

They achieved world first on their first attempt because they are clearly the best 25 man guild in the world. Method are leaps and bounds ahead of other guilds and if you've watched their other videos you will notice how chill and relax they are. <br />

Could you be even more stereotypical? Pizza pockets and no showering? I think you've watched South Park a few too many times mate. These top guilds take time out of their yearly schedule to accomplish what they achieved. It's not as if they play 16 hours a day all year. The other 11 months are spent working, studying and being normal people. And why wouldn't a women go near them? The type of women you're referring to is a shallow mole who is only interested in social status and what others think. Your comments are outdated and evident that you yourself live the above stated life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or look at other games, like Starcraft 2. The Koreans pros train up 10-12h a day, EVERY DAY. Not just for 1-2 weeks every 4 month. Okay, it's their job, but people spend much more time on much things than method spends in WoW. Much. More.<br />
<br />
Yes but 8 hour is a job, 10 if you do paid afterhours, it's perfectly acceptable. And in case of athletes, training and attending competitions is their job. Just as I go to work from 7-15, 5 days a week, they train that much for their discipline. I often stay to 16:00 or 17:00 when I'm needed, or when I feel I could get stuff done, but that's still only 9-10 hours everyone once in a while, that's not 15-16hours for two, three weeks straight. <br />
<br />
If you're not a professional and have a normal 8 hour job, you train as a hobby, and I do not believe most non-professionals invest 8 hour trainings per day, including their 8 hour jobs. They handle it as a hobby, and maybe train more before competitions, but they are not working 16 hours a day, that would be nonsense, well maybe some bizarre athletes schools who force children from the age of 3 to train 8+ hours a day, but that's not humane. <br />
<br />
As far as I remember, there's also a governed rule in Korea when and how long kids can play video games, and it's right because of what you said, people spending way too much time behind the screen, abandoning everything else in the live in pursuit of being good at a video game. <br />
<br />
You can not tell me that a person who spends 15-16h raiding a day, 7 days a week for 3 weeks is social developed like your avg. guy, even when they are done I bet this guy has social anxiety and can't really approach people like your avg. joe can. For example take that Blood Legion guy, Affinity I believe, who streams, he's always in that bath robe (every single time I turned his stream, seems like he doesn't even get dressed anymore), he has that 3L pitcher of a softdrink, and he is pale and skinny as fuck, that is not normal - sorry, and if I missed about his health status and he has any sort of health issues, I'm sorry, but I've seen kids like him before, like the brother of my now wife, was a PC addict, and he was like a zombie, until he got his shit together, now he's lifting me with one hand and feels 53252 better, and he's still enjoying gaming, but in normal dosage.</div></div><hr />

Damn I never thought about a 3l pitcher for my soft drinks. Maybe I am behind the times.<br />

In all seriousness though, the way I dress is pretty simple. I sit at home all day, enjoying what I do, so I sit comfortably. As I streamed it sort of turned into a routine/expected appearance so I just stuck with it.<br />

I'd like to point out that I interact and communicate with way more people than anyone I would have had I not taken the current path I am with streaming. I wouldn't exactly use me as an average gamer, as I do make around $2-3000 a month sitting on my ass playing a video game ENTERTAINING people. What I am doing now will very easily lead into a career path in radio, television, or some other form of entertainment. I'm not simply sitting on my ass all day playing video games eating twinkies and drinking Mountain Dew all day long. <br />
<br />
I am one of the few turning video gaming into a career path, the same that Towelliee, Athene, Swifty, or any of the other big name streamers do -- I just so happen to do it while playing competitively in a video game that I love, and I love to share my opinions and experiences with the twitch community.<br />
<br />
<br />

Tbh i don't think anyone would employ you if you have not manually worked *or worked a proper job in years* Getting work these days comes down to a few things *Qualifications,experience,work experience and people you know and refferences. so i personally think you will struggle to get a normal job *ie working at a supermarket nevermind getting a big job on tv,radio station etc.<br />
Also boasting about how popular your streams are is kind of pathetic, i could post a video on youtube and get 1 mil views but at the end of the day its just a number of random individuals that you will never meet so why boast? it does not make you cool at all.<br />
Just go out TRY get a job *like normal people do* meet people and have a life. trust me you will be 1000% happier than sitting at hopme 16+hours a day staring at a monitor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reality is like the guys says, if you play this game 16 hours a day for two to three weeks you are bound to actually finish the tier somewhere near the top, just because instead of 20 attempts at a boss you get 100-200, that's called brute forcing really. There's guilds in the top 200 (including mine) who are now 11/13 with as little as 4 hours a raid night with 3 raids a week - and that's like not really too far off from the top guilds, at 12 hours a weeks vs. 112 hours a week for the top guild (if we assume 16h x 7day) - just picture that, just do it, it's insane amount of time spent no wonder they make 10 times faster progress. <br />
<br />
The dedication of the &quot;top&quot; guilds is certainly admirable and I personally don't deny their success or envy them in the slightest, but you have to understand that they are at the top simply because their members chose WoW in front everything else (school, work, family) for as long as the content is not beat, not because they are the best players. <br />
<br />
Personally I couldn't deal with such a schedule, I got work to worry about and a family, 3 raids nights at 4 hours is the most I'm willing to invest into this game and even that is much some times - does that mean I'm less skilled? I certainly don't believe so, it just means I'm not investing the same amount of time, and there's tons of players out there equally skilled or even higher, that can not commit to the schedule of top raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
But still, you can't really compare your progress to theirs, since you have more lockouts/better ilevel etc. So the simple comparison of time investment is not really valid.<br />
Probably there are many people out there, who are more 'talented' swimmers than Michael Phelps (just to name someone I read above), but are not as successful, because they don't practice as much as him for whatever reason (not wanting to give up their social live or their career maybe). However, there is no possibility to give those 'talented' people any credit - how should I? I only see Michael Phelps, who swims the fastest and therefore gets the gold medal.<br />
<br />
If you think it is not ok/healthy/reasonable to spent this massive amount of time on a game or any other hobby, than I can absolutely agree with you. I would never do this, even the casual wow playing I did was to much for me. However, obviously this behaviour leads to some kind of success, and as long as this is the case, there will always be someone who does it.<br />
<br />
And as I stated before, you simply can't say, if those top players are more or less 'talented' than you are, since the only quantitative measurement would be the progress speed. Stating, that they are not the very best is a mere presumption that can not be proven.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to skip to the end of your post and say, that yes I am on this website, because I'm a fan of the game, I'm also on other websites and forums for things I care about and personally I think that's what the internet is for, to get information and to exchange information and discuss. There is much more to this site as just hardcore gaming - the way you enjoy it, or am I mistaken here? <br />
<br />
All I said is my opinion, sorry if I offend you, but your appearance tells me you're not healthy, and as said I might and considering what you say am completely wrong, but I say what I see, fast metabolism aside, I can not get fat either, even while eating and not doing anything, but I still try to keep in the best shape possible that I sea fit without spending time in the gym (cycling, walking, swimming). <br />
<br />
And I know your stream is successful, I've seen you streaming all the time, you make sponsor money, you enjoy the game, but I don't know how you can say communication via a input field is the same as communication face to face with someone, this forum is read by thousands, so by your way of thinking I'm actually communicating with thousands people now since they might read my posts - anyway doesn't matter much you have your mind set I see. <br />
<br />
All those guys you mention are making sponsor cash now but as with anything I do not believe their fame and fortune will last, I've been through many e-sport events to see the rise and fall of that stuff. People were once mad excited about the CPL, and where is the CPL right now, gone, as people get older they lose interest in gaming, more so to spectate other people play - Korea being the sole exception to the rule. I also remember guys like Dj.Wheat back from the Quake days when he was playing and later turned into a shout caster and I think he and a handful guys really got the talent to do that he was amazing, but I lost interest to listen to someone explaining me games, as did many of my friends who I grow up with, we tuned in to every &quot;pro&quot; Quake match and listened to Wheat shoutcast it, now nobody of us cares for anything of that for any particular game, we tune in here and there to check new stuff and see fun games but that's it. <br />
<br />
- You're not casting<br />
- You're playing a game you like<br />
- You're streaming that said game being played by you <br />
<br />
What qualifications does this give you for a &quot;real&quot; entertainment industry job? Do you see a lot of TV shows where people sit and stream their game being mute and comment to some chat every once in a while. Personally I tune to your stream or any other stream for that matter, to see the game you're playing not you. I think that's for most people, people want to see the game being played, bosses being tackled and killer, not you. <br />
<br />
You might have technical knowledge, how to hook up equipment, set it up properly and editing videos, but to be infront camera or actually take part of the program I don't think anyone will want you for that - but as said my personal opinions I might be totally wrong.</div></div><hr />

If you can afford the financial loss of playing WoW 16 hours a day, you have enough money to keep a woman around that would be otherwise not interested.</div></div><hr />

I kinda have to agree with him, i was out of curious checking few streams of your. Man, you look like ur slowly dying in unhealthy condition. I care less about ur popularity, fame, views, or whatever. I don't want to sound like an asshole, is this what you really want to do? Dying and torture yourself into unhealthy gaming way?</div></div><hr />
