Season 4 ETA<br />
It looks like we won't get the Season 4 as soon as the patch is released, we might have to wait a few weeks/months before it starts.<br />
Not very soon. S3 rewards have quite a bit of life left in them before they start to feel obsoleted by pve gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sunwell Plateau temporarily closed on PTRs<br />
Sunwell Plateau is once again closed for a short amount of time because of a bug on Lady Sacrolash and Grand Warlock Alythess.<br />
We discovered a pretty obnoxious bug with the Lady Sacrolash and Grand Warlock Alythess encounter that is making the encounter much more difficult than intended. Until we get that bug resolved, we're going to bring down the Sunwell Raid instance on the PTR. I have no ETA on the fix at this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tournament Test Realm testing<br />
Tuesday and Wednesday means maintenance on US and EU realms, why don't you use this time to help the testing on Tournament Test Realm ?<br />
<br />
What's the Tournament Test Realm ?<br />
This realm is used to test &quot;Tournament&quot; type realms, any character created on these realms will be level 70 and NPCs are selling PvP Armors/Weapons as well as enchantments and gems in all the starting zones. For more information about the tournament please check the following pages.<br />
2008 World of Warcraft Arena tournament (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/index.xml) page on the official site.<br />

List of items (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/items.xml) available from NPCs on the Tournament realms.<br />
If you plan to play on test realms, you should also read the TTR/PTR FAQ (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5103800799&amp;postId=51032917367&amp;sid=1#0) on the official forums.<br />

Patch mirrors<br />
The Blizzard Downloader is fairly fast, but if you're still looking for a direct download link to download the first PTR patch, here you go. This is only the first &quot;big&quot; PTR patch, you will still have to download multiple &quot;small&quot; patches to get the latest build from PTRs<br />

Focused testing<br />
You might be able to help devs resolving these issues, if you see something strange run to your closest test realm forum and report the bug !<br />
In Preparation of the arena realms we have made a number of fixes to various aspects of the area system. There are several issues that are very difficult to reproduce in controlled situations we believe these issues are fixed in 2.4 but we would like feedback from players to be sure.<br />
<br />
Please if you see any of the following issues occurring while playing on the TTR report it in this thread.<br />
Please post screenshots if able, this is a great help to us in tracking these issues down.<br />
<br />
The Arena Teams can sometimes enter a state so that leaving a team can result in leaving a different team than intended.<br />
Arena team win-loss statistics and individual team member win-loss statistics do not always match each other or the teams' gains/losses in rating.<br />
It appears that sometimes a rated arena team can get matched up against a skirmish &quot;team&quot; in rated arena matches.<br />
At the conclusion of an arena match sometimes there will be no arena team names displayed, the rating change column will display either &quot;---&quot; or a large random number, and the team that won will often report losing rating points several minutes after they have exited the match.</div></div><hr />

I never cry for heals (as I am the RL and need to consentrate on keeping the raid on track before keeping myself alive), and I try to always spell words correctly (although as I'm not a native english speaker, spelling mistakes do happen). <br />
<br />
In regard to my first post: Do you really think the new 150 badge X-bow look good? It does in fact remind me of the pink paladin gear design. Ugly but good.</div></div><hr />

Add to this the fact that Cataclysm has less stam than the S3 sword while Apolyon has 12 MORE stam and 10 equivalent dps more than the S4 sword and you have to wonder what Blizzard is trying to say by reversing this trend and making the S4 weapon this underpowered (or the Apolyon this overpowered). Pve for pvp weapons?</div></div><hr />

i think that sets are getting quite out of hand , its more and more extravagant , like clown sets that have nothing to do with WoW lore</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the loot from kil'jaeden , like apolyon, have never actually been seen. All the stats are from a leak several months ago. The stats could very well change before they were even put on the ptr, and will almost certainly change before they go live. <br />
<br />
As for graphics:<br />

I personally think they are coming right out of one hell of a crazy rave (invite plz!!). That said, I like them. Considering they are all going to be replaced relatively soon once we hit WotLK, I would at least like to keep something cool as a novelty item.</div></div><hr />

I have an 1872 2v2 and a 1770 3v3, but clothies with 490 Resil being hit for damage that should hit them for 2-3k from a warrior? I know the concept behind it, it's just Blizzard broke Resil when they introduced it, they need to cap resil at 200 so that newer teams getting into arenas aren't going up against these higher Resil folks until maybe 1800+. I only say this because most folks i know wanting to get into arenas go thru long rediculous Q times and to get rapped by guys who have full season gear like myself (no shoulders yet).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Carrex</div><div class="date">2008-03-04, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">TBH, the Arena system they have sucks. One is that people who recently make new teams end up getting owned by people with Full S3 gear, and that doesn't give other people chances to get some arena points. They should have the personal arena rating system be permanent for All 3 Teams which can let other people succeed in arenas. Which would make it impossible for people who have Full S3 gear be able to play people in S1 gear. And how are queueing system with personal arena rating be matched up instead of having the actual team rating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We definitely feel the need for warlocks to gain some sort of active defense so we don't have to try to balance them around the assumption that they're &quot;tanking&quot; melee classes. For example, an idea we're running with internally is the concept of a warlock being able to cast a spell that places a circle of demonic power on the ground. The warlock would be able to teleport to this location from within a relatively short range (ie: 40 yards), and would also be able to summon demons more quickly if they're standing within the circle.<br />
<br />
Note: this idea is intended as a sneak peek, it's not something that we're planning for 2.4, it would be more likely as an expansion ability, and may change entirely before said time.<br />
<br />
So no, we're not sitting around going &quot;rabble rabble, those darn forum locks are ruining our nerfing funz, no more fun for them, one year!&quot;<br />
