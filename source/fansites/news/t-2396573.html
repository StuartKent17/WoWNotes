Wow, the salt is real. Please make a better one. Don't use the excuse 'I don't know how' or 'I can't make videos', if this is genuinely 'badly' animated, then it shouldn't be difficult to do better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's got a timeless art style with models and environments becoming more and more detailed with every expansion.<br />
<br />
If you think it's ugly then fair enough, I think realistic games are ugly, but OLD looking? Fuck no. It ages so well thanks to its art style. Just wait for the inevitable HD remake of all the 1-60 zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe a few priests and/or paladins tried putting up shields to save atleast a few, but one paladin of each faction could have bubbled and be forced to watch the devastation at the end, giving eachother pained looks as their friends are dead and the zone is burning.<br />
<br />
Still, fantastic work!</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I think you are wrong. The intro is abslolutely great . His camera pans are excellent. I believe what the creator wanted to show with this intro, is that life in silithus goes on as usual while you can hear the clock ticking on the impending doom that is near. The burning man in the end opening his arms and accepting his fate is just 1 of the saddest or even the saddest think i have ever seen in a machinima video. <br />
My only complaint is the length. I really, really wanted to see more.<br />
Another think that surprised me is Silithus itself. Seriously i don't remember that zone, looking so good. Maybe it was just the video or the filters.....i don't know</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zulazibah</div><div class="date">2018-05-14, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard needs to hire This man and 1 more animator, and given access to in house animation technologies. Given one more hand on this the animations such as the Nelf riding in the beginning and some of the other parts would have made this 110% above what even blizzard does for cut scenes. <br />
<br />
I am not being negative, I love this video and I think as it is , SHOULD be put into the game as a mini quest line with this video at the end of the chain, like seriously officially. <br />
<br />
Having quest lines like legion with 2-5 minutes of compelling video content thrills me to play through. I really hope that silithus is a big deal quest zone now, because I played through it, i was a random quester and PVPer in silithus. I've never had as much emotion for the zone (I did for AQ and seeing the armored character at the end at the gates was definently emotional) as I do now after this video. I have LOVED legions videos, but they have missed opportunities such as this video shows, and to have someone on the team that can identify and excute this kind of story line is amazing. another creator i would like to mention is: Hurricane `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JNOxz9paA6E` The type of way that this makes me feel, the visualization of the transport pad up to naxxramas... the drag of the corrupted ashbringer brings this video to life and makes me want to raid this again. <br />
<br />
The other plug i must share is `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04dwYTPi_rk` the lost codex, this in depth video of how each boss works, and the story behind them, and the presentation makes you feel something for the no-name bosses previously thought as just filler. with back story mixed in with the mechanics of the fight is a real treat that should be at the release of every raid, Maybe not in the same style of &quot;intel received&quot; as this specific video, or in the lost codex format specifically, but something that gave insight into what you'd be up against.</div></div><hr />
