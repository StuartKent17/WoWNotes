The change to 50% from 100% was a significant nerf but kept the talent strong. I hope they compensate with some survivability or even a threat buff somewhere. I don't feel like Prot has much utility besides damage and holding threat against equally geared demon hunters and other strong burst AoE specs is quite difficult without Avatar being up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They've since datamined a &quot;plundered supplies&quot; bag which is the same prefix as Island drops, so maybe this is an improvement?<br />
<br />
But they're also mining Arathi Warfronts gear? Are we getting new appearances with heroic Warfronts? I hope not..</div></div><hr />

<br />
My first reaction as well.. it was already on the way out in builds that favor more mobility by going with the simplistic 3 button rotation. Not seeing how a nerf was needed to the only talent in the tree that actually makes the spec at least a tiny bit interesting.<br />
<br />
The changes to frost DK have me equally baffled.. well at least unholy got a buff.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">muto</div><div class="date">2019-06-05, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol at the Mage nerf. Shows how out of touch Blizzard is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably blizz saw Cabal data and were like &quot;Mage dps is visible on Details&quot; *Hits nerf button* :D jokes aside, lot's of classes getting nerfed, so I REALLY HOPE that this is only to compensate us being so OP in that build because of the new stuff we got. Also... m+ GS build is completely dead I guess. :D<br />
Frost Mages are at a really nice spot with regular, PI and no_IL builds being kind of viable in different situations, we just lack numbers.</div></div><hr />

Oh, well. <br />

&quot;Molten core exists&quot;<br />
like what the fuck do you want them to post?<br />
we know EVERYTHING that will be in the game...<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I wish they'd make the new dungeon heroic and normal too cause that mount is gonna be hard as hell to get<br />
<br />
like kharazhan it will become heroic and normal later on, and be split into 2 parts.<br />
<br />

<br />
correct, they buffed icicle damage, and are nerfing glacial spike cause its based on icicle damage.</div></div><hr />

SO STUPID!!!!. and as a warrior now unholy dk are stronger, you also just made survival hunters a lot stronger so RIP Warrior, Feral Druids, Enh Shammy. Fix the classes that need help not classes that don't. If you look in the 2v2 and 3v3 the classes you buffed are all on top and the classes you nerfed are in the bottom (POINTLESS). There is no such thing as enh shammy anymore. It is sad that you guys are not able to balance a simple class out. and it can be so easy. If you need help balancing a class or classes I got you covered, it is so easy to do. you just over complicate it</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skumnasty</div><div class="date">2019-06-05, 10:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For everyone complaining about nerfs and buffs... I assume you are playing on the PTR? If not, then to see a &quot;buff&quot; or &quot;nerf&quot; and think &quot;OMG they are buffing/nerfing this class that is already strong/weak right now!&quot; then you're being silly because this is a buff/nerf based on the class' 8.2 power, NOT their current power. Wether it will end up as a net buff/nerf with any other tuning/new items etc is yet to be seen.</div></div><hr />
