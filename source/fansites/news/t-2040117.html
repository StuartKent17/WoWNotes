WoW Moving to Subscription Model in China<br />
World of Warcraft is moving to a subscription model in China! Up until now, players have purchased a number of minutes rather than paying a monthly fee. Existing game time is being converted into days of gametime, with roughly 150 minutes to a day of subscription. <br />
<br />

One of the reasons it's still very popular is the fact that they can pay for the minutes as they want. Moving to the Monthly system is gonna mess that up for alot of Chinese players.<br />

Actually over 50% players were angered by this decision. It was announced on July. 30th and will take effect in less than one week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mythic+ rewards raid-level loot. It makes sense to only unlock it when raiding because available. It'll be a few weeks after launch.<br />
<br />
It's fine, gives people time to level up, finish their questing, start gearing up through normals, heroics and regular mythics and check everything else out without having to immediately stress about getting their raid teams together and moving straight away like we had in Wrath. Keeping Mythic+ locked until then is just logical, else the entire goal of a raider on launch will be to farm the fuck out of them until raids launch so you're already in Mythic Raid Loot before Emerald Nightmare comes out :P<br />
<br />
It's the same reason Titanforged ilvls are gonna be locked to like 850 or whatever it was until raiding opens.</div></div><hr />

Damn it, Blizzard<br />
<br />
Tell me about it. At level 100 people are already one shotting the rares making it pretty much impossible to get them unless you camp right on their spawn point with your finger on the mouse button ready to tag them when they spawn, and it was already pretty crowded at least on my server. Now they are adding even more people with their stupid CRZ thing, wonderful. What they really need to do is apply their new Legion mob scaling tech to the rares so they don't instantly die.</div></div><hr />

Yes, only people in a Blizzard beta have access to the beta launcher right now. Previously was Legion &amp; Overwatch. <br />
<br />
It's...interesting. I created a new character and streamed it to facebook but apparently it picks up any audio on your computer, not just wow so it was picking up netflix and other random stuff I was doing. I realize that most streamers are dedicated to playing &amp; talking but i was hoping i could sort of document leveling this new shaman so friends &amp; family could see the game or something. <br />
<br />
I don't see how people will make $ with this though. You can turn on video camera but I haven't seen anything for overlays or whatever that they would use to display ads and stuff. I guess you would do that through facebook?</div></div><hr />

I can't find the option either on my current launcher, or in my account settings, so I'm assuming so.<br />
<br />
I can't find any info anywhere. :-/</div></div><hr />

It's...interesting. I created a new character and streamed it to facebook but apparently it picks up any audio on your computer, not just wow so it was picking up netflix and other random stuff I was doing. I realize that most streamers are dedicated to playing &amp; talking but i was hoping i could sort of document leveling this new shaman so friends &amp; family could see the game or something. <br />
<br />
I don't see how people will make $ with this though. You can turn on video camera but I haven't seen anything for overlays or whatever that they would use to display ads and stuff. I guess you would do that through facebook?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, I appreciate it. :)<br />
<br />
I suspect the functionality isn't really for monetizing what you're doing (as far as Twitch streamers do at the moment); more the &quot;let-your-friends-check-it-out&quot; that you describe. That would mean ads and the like aren't really part of the audience, but I was wondering where your webcam put your face and what the quality of the stream actually was.<br />
<br />
As for picking up your other audio, did you check out the individual settings? It does appear that it's designed to only pick up the game audio, so I'd imagine that's a bug worth reporting if you've ticked the box and your viewers ended up with a background of Jessica Jones, Family Guy or Downton Abbey!</div></div><hr />
