Patch 2.4.2 : Zhevra Mount &amp; Mace Recolor<br />
Most of the time when a new patch is released, a few item recolors are added to the game. These recolors are here if devs need a &quot;fast&quot; way to add an item and just want to use a different color of an existing model (and actually it doesn't happen very often if you compare it to the amount of recolors available). Two additional &quot;sets&quot; of colors have been added with the 2.4.2 : One for the new &quot;Zhevra mount&quot; and another one for one of the 2H Mace model already available in the game files. Thanks to endarion for the work he did on these screenshots !<br />
<br />
As usual, we don't even know if these new colors will be used in the game at some point (and actually we're not even sure if the Zhevra Mount will be here), but it's still fun to check them. <br />

Blue posts<br />
During the last few days I didn't report any blue post because of all the 2.4.2 updates, even if there wasn't anything really important you might find a few of them interesting.<br />
<br />
Death Knight starting level<br />
We haven't completely finalized a number, but we plan to have them start at a level lower than 70. We didn't have Draenei or Blood Elves start at a higher level when they first entered the game so we are aiming to make this Hero Class at a good level to learn abilities but also get to Northrend a little faster. I understand that it may not be your favorite part, but leveling is part of the game, especially when creating a new character. The extra boost in leveling should help introduce the epic-ness (is that a word?) of the first Hero Class and give people more of a chance to try it out. While they may be a little behind in leveling, Deathknights will find their way into raid groups too, just like Shaman and Paladins did for the Alliance and Horde when they were first introduced.

Hunter Pet Growl Change<br />
Growl was scaling incorrectly before so it's been changed to scale with the hunter's AP starting at around 1200 AP. Other pet abilities such as bite, claw, etc will still scale with pet AP.

Arena Tournament : Penalty for adding players to a team<br />
With phase 2 beginning today, records have been reset and there is a penalty for adding players to a team. The practice phase has ended and now the fighting matters. You can still create a new team, you'll just have to earn the point penalties back, so good luck in your matches if that's the case! When phase 3 begins the teams will be locked and no changes allowed. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5974352939&amp;postId=59737786000&amp;sid=1#5))<br />

Will there be a new currency system in WotLK ? (Something with a higher value than gold ?)<br />
We do watch the economy of the game but we don't have any plans of changing the current setup right now. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5974483232&amp;postId=59734678567&amp;sid=1#15))<br />

Season 4 and Tournament Phase 2 posts<br />
First, we've got a post from Drysc to explains which items are going to be available once the season 4 is here.<br />
Yes, the Season 3 honor items will still be available for purchase without a rating requirement after Season 4 starts.<br />
<br />
There will be two sets of &quot;non-set&quot; items once Season 4 begins. The Season 4 honor items (boot/belt/bracer/etc) some of which will require a rating, and the Season 3 items (boot/belt/bracer/etc) which still won't require any rating.<br />
<br />
Just to sum up, when Season 4 begins:<br />
<br />
Season 1 honor set: Removed<br />
<br />
Season 2 arena set: Moved to honor, no rating requirement<br />
<br />
Season 3 non-set honor items: Staying<br />
Season 3 arena set: Arena rating and cost requirements lowered<br />
<br />
Season 4 non-set honor items: Added with rating requirement<br />
Season 4 arena set: Added to Arena with increased rating requirement<br />
Drysc also explains the changes behind the rating requirements added to honor items.<br />
The non-set items are there to fill out the arena sets, they're essentially placed there specifically so that arena players have a reason to participate in other aspects of the game. We want to see their faces around, we don't want them just standing on top of the battlemasters all day.<br />
<br />
So, with them being arena items intended to fill out the current top-end arena set, and our increase to rating requirements all around, it's actually very logical.<br />
And if you didn't know yet, the Arena Tournament Phase 2 has begun !<br />

What kind of easier you're talking about? You mean getting exalted with a faction like SSO (after a month starting with neutral) to purchase stuff near karazhan level/2.3 badge level??? Because going into a raid to try a drop there is nowhere near that easy. Wanna compare season 4 stuff that is killer gear (common, almost Sunwell level) and you could get after a day of afk bg farming with something that MIGHT drop for you from a certain boss in a certain Raid that you will waste gold in repair bills, consumables, etc... (that could need up to 25 ppl instead of only you afking in a BG)?!?! Non-sense.<br />
<br />
Altought I do agree they should use a rating like a &quot;BG Rating&quot; using BG stuff to calculate it, like BG objectives done (cap farm in AB or helping destroying a tower in AV, etc...) it would be insane to give season 4 level of gear for just some little honor grinding.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aRtFuL</div><div class="date">2008-04-28, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">BG Gear should be totally built around BG play and require BG rating to achieve. Arena should require Arena play and require Arena rating to achieve. That's the way it should be. The stats between the 2 types of gear should not even be the same.<br />
<br />
Arena players are not going to suddenly play more bg just because they know the s4 bg gear requires rating - they are going to play anyways because they need to, and will stop just the same once they are done to concentrate on pvp. I have no idea what Blizzard is trying to do here. They might as well just move those gear into arena points system.<br />
<br />
Arena players has no reason to play outside of arenas anyways, and no matter how Blizzard tries to justify arena to be end-all pvpers fact remains that players that are high-rated in arenas are not necessary good in other forms of pvp, because in arena you don't get use all types of abilities/materials/terrains available and you don't always have your partners with you in world/bg. Blizzard should try to embrace this and give people the rewards for being good at doing what they are good at, instead of constantly try to beat the natural order through overpowering gear/requirements in only 1 form of pvp (fixtured pvp mind you).</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, growl doesn't scale. Blizzard thinks it does, but they also think a shot rotation is using autoshot and arcane shot whenever the cooldown is up--nevermind steady shot or multishot. They have no idea how hunters work.</div></div><hr />
