In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm we’ll be making several changes to class talents and abilities. Here you will get a glimpse into some of the changes we have in store for the druid. The information you’re about to read is certainly not complete, and is only meant to act as a preview of some of the exciting new things to come. Let’s kick things off by checking out some of the new druid spells and abilities!<br />
<br />
New Druid Abilities<br />
<br />
Thrash (Level 81): Thrash deals damage and causes all targets within 10 yards to bleed every 2 seconds for 6 seconds. The intent here is to give bears another button to hit while tanking. Talents will affect the bleed, such as causing Swipe to deal more damage to bleeding targets. 5-second cooldown. 25 Rage.<br />
<br />
Stampeding Roar (Level 83): The druid roars, increasing the movement of all allies within 10 yards by 40% for 8 seconds. Stampeding Roar can be used in cat or bear form, but bears might have a talent to drop the cooldown. The goal of this ability is to give both bears and cats a little more situational group utility. 3-minute cooldown. No cost.<br />
<br />
Wild Mushroom (Level 85): Grows a magical mushroom at the target location. After 4 seconds the mushroom becomes invisible. Enemies who cross the mushroom detonate it, causing it to deal area-of-effect damage, though its damage component will remain very effective against single targets. The druid can also choose to detonate the mushroom ahead of time. This is primarily a tool for the Balance druid, and there will be talents that play off of it. No cooldown. 40-yard range. Instant cast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Changes to Abilities and Mechanics<br />
<br />
In addition to the new abilities listed above, we intend to make changes to some of the other abilities and mechanics with which you’re already familiar. This list and the summary of talent changes below it are by no means comprehensive, but they should give you a good sense of our goals for each spec.<br />
<br />
All heal-over-time spells (HoTs) will benefit from crit and haste innately in Cataclysm. Hasted HoTs do not reduce their duration, but instead add additional HoT ticks. Haste will also benefit Energy generation while in cat form.<br />
<br />
Unlike the other healers, Restoration druids will not be receiving any new spells. They have plenty to work with already, and our challenge instead is to make sure all of them have a well-defined niche. A druid should be able to tank-heal with stacks of Lifebloom, spot-heal a group with Nourish and Regrowth, and top off lightly wounded targets with Rejuvenation.<br />
<br />
We want to add tools to cat form and depth to bear form. If a Feral cat is going to fill a very similar niche to that of a rogue, warrior or Enhancement shaman, it needs a few more tools -- primarily a reliable interrupt. Bears need to be pushing a few more buttons just so the contrast between tanking and damage-dealing is not so steep.<br />
<br />
Barkskin will be innately undispellable.<br />
<br />
We will be buffing the damage of Mangle (cat) significantly so that when cat druids cannot Shred, they are not at such a damage-dealing loss.<br />
<br />
Druids will lose Abolish Poison with the dispel mechanics change, but Restoration druids will gain Dispel Magic (on friendly targets) as a talent. All druids can still remove poisons with Cure Poison and remove curses with Remove Curse.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Talents and Talent Changes<br />
<br />
Tree of Life is changing from a passive talent to a cooldown-based talent, similar to Metamorphosis. Mechanically, it feels unfair for a druid to have to give up so much offense and utility in order to be just as good at healing as the other classes who are not asked to make that trade. We are exploring the exact benefit the druid gets from Tree of Life. It could strictly be better healing, or it could be that each heal behaves slightly different. You also will not be able to be banished in Tree of Life form (this will probably be true of Metamorphosis as well). Additionally, we would like to update the Tree of Life model so that it feels more exciting when you do decide to go into that form. Our feeling is that druids rarely actually get to show off their armor, so it would be nice to have at least one spec that looked like a night elf or tauren (and soon troll or worgen) for most of the time.<br />
<br />
We want to make the Feral cat damage rotation slightly more forgiving. We do not want to remove what druids like about their gameplay, but we do want to make it less punishing to miss, say, a Savage Roar or Rake. The changes here will be on par with increasing the duration of Mangle like we did for patch 3.3.3.<br />
<br />
Balance druids will have a new talent ability called Nature’s Torrent, which strikes for either Nature or Arcane damage depending on which will do the most damage (or possibly both), and moves the Eclipse meter more (details below). The improved version of Nature’s Torrent also reduces the target's movement speed. 10-second cooldown.<br />
<br />
Restoration druids will have a new talent called Efflorescence, which causes a bed of healing flora to sprout beneath targets that are critically healed by Regrowth.<br />
<br />
We plan on giving Feral cats and bears a Kick/Pummel equivalent -- an interrupt that is off the global cooldown and does no damage. We feel like they need this utility to be able to fill the melee role in a dungeon or raid group, and to give them more PvP utility.<br />
<br />
We want to make sure Feral and Balance druids feel like good options for an Arena team. They need the tools to where you might consider a Feral druid over an Arms warrior, or a Balance druid over a mage or warlock. Remember that the PvP landscape will probably look pretty different for Cataclysm with a focus on rated, competitive Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Balance<br />
Spell Damage<br />
Spell Haste<br />
Eclipse<br />
<br />
Eclipse: We are moving Eclipse from a talent into a core mechanic of the class and making it less random. Balance druids will have a new UI element that shows a sun and a moon. Whenever they cast an Arcane spell, it will move the UI closer to the sun, and buff their Nature damage. Whenever they cast a Nature spell, it will move the UI closer to the moon, and buff their Arcane damage. The gameplay intention is to alternate Arcane and Nature spells (largely Starfire and Wrath) to maintain the balance.<br />
<br />
Feral (Cat)<br />
Melee Damage<br />
Melee Critical Damage<br />
Bleed Damage<br />
<br />
Feral (Bear)<br />
Damage Reduction<br />
Vengeance<br />
Savage Defense<br />
<br />
Bleed Damage and Savage Defense: Feral druids will receive two sets of passive bonuses depending on whether the druid is in cat or bear form. Bleed Damage will be improved for cats. Savage Defense is the current bear mechanic for converting crits into damage absorption and will be improved for bears.<br />
<br />
Vengeance: This is a mechanic to ensure that tank damage (and therefore threat) doesn’t fall behind as damage-dealing classes improve their gear during the course of the expansion. All tanking specs will have Vengeance as their second talent tree passive bonus. Whenever a tank gets hit, Vengeance will give them a stacking attack power buff equal to 5% of the damage done, up to a maximum of 10% of the character’s unbuffed health. For boss encounters we expect that tanks will always have the attack power bonus equal to 10% of their health. The 5% and 10% bonuses assume 51 talent points have been put into the Feral tree and the druid is in bear form -- these values will be smaller at lower levels. Remember, you only get this bonus if you have spent the most talent points in the Feral tree and are in bear form, so you won’t see Balance, Restoration, or Feral druids in cat form running around with it. Vengeance will let us continue to make tank gear more or less the way we do today -- there will be some damage-dealing stats, but mostly survival-oriented stats. Druids typically have more damage-dealing stats even on their tanking gear, so the Vengeance benefit may be smaller, but overall the goal is that all four tanks do about the same damage when tanking.<br />
<br />
Restoration<br />
Healing<br />
Meditation<br />
HoT Scale Healing<br />
<br />
HoT Scale Healing: HoTs will do increased healing on more wounded targets. The mechanic is similar to that of the Restoration shaman, but with HoTs instead of direct heals. In Cataclysm, we anticipate druids using a greater variety of their spells so there is a distinction between healing and HoT healing.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoyed this preview, and ask that you provide your initial thoughts and feedback on what was presented here. Please keep in mind, what you’ve just reviewed is a work in progress and as we move closer to the Cataclysm beta, you’ll see these changes as well as others continue to develop in response to testing and feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I knew it! I knew they were smoking something over there at Blizz HQ. The truth comes out! Wild Mushroom itself is a gimmicky move and sounds, yet again, like a PvP talent.<br />
<br />
Why are the level 85 talents so PvP oriented?<br />
<br />
We plan on giving Feral cats and bears a Kick/Pummel equivalent<br />
<br />
Now that is a good addition. :)</div></div><hr />

Wild Mushroom sounds like a lot of fun and Regrowth applying healing effects on the area where a recipient of a critical heal walls should see the spell being used a fair amount more than currently.<br />

Oh, so an on-use self boost to healing, letting you decide as an individual when you require more throughput instead of the boss being at 30% isn't good enough?<br />
<br />
To finally rid the restoration druid of that horrific tree model as well is quite blissful.</div></div><hr />

It's also totally true. The spells are being changed though, note the new affect of critical Regrowths making them to be like a smaller Healing Rain.</div></div><hr />

dont like that they change Tree of Life like that. I love to run around like a tree, kinda the reason why i wanted to heal as a druid in the first place. oh well, cant win every time i guess.</div></div><hr />

Fair, as not, what would you have liked? Druid Resto already has:<br />
<br />
A big heal<br />
A HoT<br />
A smaller heal that ends in a HoT<br />
A HoT that ends in a smaller heal<br />
A medium sized heal that is buffed by a HoT<br />
A big AoE heal with a long cooldown<br />
A small to medium AoE heal with a short cooldown<br />
A HoT triggered by critical heals<br />
<br />
That's a LOT of spells to work with. Hell, that's about as many as any Priest has, and WAY more than Shaman and Pallies have. It sounds like they're going to try to add buffs to those heals rather than just give you yet another button you might push but won't. They're only going to add so much to each healing spec. So wouldn't you rather they make those heals do interesting things, rather than giving you yet another heal to fill a niche that doesn't really exist?</div></div><hr />

All heal-over-time spells (HoTs) will benefit from crit and haste innately in Cataclysm. Hasted HoTs do not reduce their duration, but instead add additional HoT ticks. Haste will also benefit Energy generation while in cat form.<br />

You must be one of the few. After healing as a Tree of Life for over 3 years (I think!) I am thoroughly sick of the horrible, lifeless model. Sure, I'll miss the one or two chuckles I got from /cower'ing in killshots but thats about it. I am really looking forward to being able to spend most of my time in caster form in heroics I outgear, throwing DPS spells without other players questioning my decision when I am still keeping them alive.<br />

It is also a change that is totally required for PvP, to remove druids from the defensive hiding in Tree Form playstyle so many had to adapt to in order to become successful.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Restoration druids will have a new talent called Efflorescence, which causes a bed of healing flora to sprout beneath targets that are critically healed by Regrowth. &quot;<br />
<br />
Regrowth Really?....Regrowth?....ohh well my QQ is most likely useless since i cant see what they are doing with the spell in cata but it seems REALLY stupid to not have it work whit nourish aswell <br />
<br />

They are changing the roles of the other heals in the game. We've already seen that Shaman and Priests will have multiple &quot;primary&quot; heals that they will choose from. There's no reason to expect Regrowth to stay in the niche it currently occupies.</div></div><hr />

A few pleasant additions (barkskin undispellable, trees unbanishable, mangle being less of a DPS loss as a kitty), but nothing that you wouldn't really see in a major content patch. I suppose the biggest change is resto druids going into their humanoid forms again, which is something I know a lot of druids have been crying out for for a long time (I don't care much personally, I'm happy being a tree or a fat cow, but it's nice to see that blizzard have taken note of the many, many requests). The new moves look fun, and it's great that ferals are getting an interrupt and some more utility, and that bears are getting more complexity, but in my mind, not a whole lot has changed in comparison to other classes. Maybe druids are just in better shape than most other classes, but it seems a bit of a &quot;nailing a few bits on, nothing to see here, continue as you were&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Buffing Mangle damage might be risky. There's a specc floating around for inexperiance druids which is basically Mangle and Ferocious Bite. God forbid that ever overtakes the 'current' style of feral dps.<br />

Any thoughts I may have previously entertained about rolling a Druid are gone with this preview, and unless they revoke the ToL change I definitely will not be rolling one in Cataclysm.<br />

On the upside of things, I really like they way they turned Eclipse into the Balance mastery and their intended handling of it. I'm curious though: how exactly will that work? Druids already have a UI in every form. A double-UI is unheard of.</div></div><hr />

Speaking as a Restoration Druid I do not play to be a tree. I play as a Druid because I enjoy the healing style afforded by our use of HoTs.

<br />
Tree of Life is changing from a passive talent to a cooldown-based talent, similar to Metamorphosis. Mechanically, it feels unfair for a druid to have to give up so much offense and utility in order to be just as good at healing as the other classes who are not asked to make that trade. We are exploring the exact benefit the druid gets from Tree of Life. <br />
<br />
As an ex-druid, this really shocked me. A lot. I believe many druids won't agree with this change. I mean - tree defining talent basically gone, dead. It's like taking away Shadowform (this would probably turn ofic. forums upside down), saying Blizzard doesn't like priests giving up so much healing power and utility to be as good damage dealers as other hybrids.<br />
I bet my Shadowfiend (sorry pal) this Tree change won't make it to the release.</div></div><hr />

I've played Moonkin for 4 years now, Love the spec and everything about it even the form, But I can tell you if they changed it to be nelf form and we had the ability to activate moonkin form/aura to give us an increase in damage or whatever I would gladly accept those changes.<br />

<br />
How else would you &quot;fix&quot; Tree Form? Blizzard have stated they wish to remove talents that are simply &quot;passive&quot; in their nature of improving damage and healing and that is basically what Tree of Life is. Its a refreshing change to see them look at an outdated mechanic and seek ways to improve it. Making it an on-demand healing boost with a new model is the perfect way of doing this.</div></div><hr />

It's a faster spell. That seems like an improvement to me. All classes have buttons that make their spells more powerful sometimes. And there are plenty of fights where extra incoming damage is predictable - whether its because there are adds or the boss has a phase or ability that hits extra hard. So now you have a button that lets you heal extra hard for a little while. I fail to see how this is useless.</div></div><hr />

Every spell in the game is getting completely rebalanced. Do you really think they're going to forget that ToL's current passive bonus composes a significant amount of a Druid's healing throughput? Stop applying Cata Preview logic to the way the game currently works. It's all changing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Go on then. Your very welcome to roll another class and leave those who enjoy the druid play style to continue as restoration. Here is the thing. I am currently sitting here, typing to tell you that I am 100% happy with the change to Tree of Life proposed for Cataclysm. Since it was introduced with its snare and reductive mana cost talents originally, Tree of Life has always been a controversial talent and one with a hardly world class model to support it. Over the previous expansion, Blizzard has eeked away some of the parts which made the talent undesirable - first the snare and then the mana reduction, leaving us with a button we pushed to go into a form where our heals were balanced with other healers. How incredibly exciting!<br />
<br />
So now, when we are possibly going to be presented with a new mechanic to make our healing more dynamic and at the same time the removal of a model which has been the bane of many restoration druids for a long time, there is no reason not to be happy.</div></div><hr />

Stop thinking of it as changed in the current state of the game. They're doing it because trees are unable to cast anything but heals without gimping theirselves, and clearly they'll balance heal effectiveness around not being able to stay in tree 24/7. It already said tree may change the effects of spells instead (I can picture it turning some heals into multi target ones).</div></div><hr />

The whole group charge thing seems... well what the hell is that? That's seriously their grand spell mid way?<br />
<br />
And actually trees do have a new ability, jut not another heal. You now get a bed of flowers to sit under your healed toon.</div></div><hr />

Yes I didn't like beeing an old barrens bush as a Night elf, new model sounds fine...but not getting a new spell like all the other healing classes just pisses me off. It would not necessarily have to be a pure healing spell ( look at the holy lolgrip inc -.-) but something would have been nice. And stop that stop whining stuff, if the holy palys wouldn't get anything new, all holy palys would freak out ._.</div></div><hr />

(I never post in caps, but this change warrents it! Plus, I might be just a tad tipsy!)<br />

Finally a return to CLASSIC healing, where we don't all sit in a useless form which offers NOTHING except an a place to put healing benefits which other healers would otherwise obtain PASSIVELY.<br />

No. I would be thankful for letting me be equivalent to other healers in raid utility.

if its not stated in the preview its not in my mind man even if they equalize the sp a bit its like taking something away from druids thats always been there<br />
<br />
its why ive played tree since tbc i dont want to look like a night elf (puke)<br />
<br />
are they taking away bear form and putting it on cd NO<br />

are they taking away cat form and putting it on cd NO<br />

If you think this change means resto druids are going to be nerfed to the ground out of form in cata with ToL on cd the same way that your healing would suck out of form in wotlk... I don't know what to say.<br />
<br />
Most likely, healing out of form in cata will be on par with the rest of the healers and the ToL shift cd being an improvement in healing. Think of it like the holy priest change (chakra) where they cast same type of spells and get better at it. It's like that except on cd and for everything whereas a priest has to cast/charge it up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe I have confused you. It can be expected that in Cataclysm Druids will have their healing abilities made &quot;equivalent&quot; in power to the other healers. When we are in caster form, there will be no disparities. Now, say there is heavy incoming raid damage, which you (as a good Druid healer) are aware of, you can now hit your &quot;Tree of Live v2.0&quot; button, adopting the updated model and receiving a considerable boost to your healing for a short period of time.<br />
<br />
For WotLK Priests and Paladins have had cooldowns which tanks or other raid members may call out for if needed. Think of the Cataclysm Tree of Life as being something similar to this.<br />

I don't like ToL being turned into a cool down ability. The whole point of a druid is to shape shift into a more powerful form for your chosen job. I was estatic when resto finally got a shape shift heading into BC and now they are taking it away from me to make it it a cool down ability. Ah well it's not making me leave my favored class, I will still play and I will adjust. I do love how HoT's will now benefit from haste and crit now, and the AOE? effect from regrowth will be nice as well. I wasn't expecting much in the way of new spells, the arsenal of a resto druid is large enough already and we can effectively fill any slot with a quick talent and glyph swap. Might not be the best healer of choice for a specific roll, but we can do it. Well we'll see how all this pans out.</div></div><hr />

Wild Mushroom (Level 85): Grows a magical mushroom at the target location. After 4 seconds the mushroom becomes invisible. Enemies who cross the mushroom detonate it, causing it to deal area-of-effect damage, though its damage component will remain very effective against single targets. The druid can also choose to detonate the mushroom ahead of time. This is primarily a tool for the Balance druid, and there will be talents that play off of it. No cooldown. 40-yard range.

I say hello. Please note my Tier 10.<br />
<br />
How else would you &quot;fix&quot; Tree Form? Blizzard have stated they wish to remove talents that are simply &quot;passive&quot; in their nature of improving damage and healing and that is basically what Tree of Life is. Its a refreshing change to see them look at an outdated mechanic and seek ways to improve it. Making it an on-demand healing boost with a new model is the perfect way of doing this.<br />
<br />
<br />
I was being sarcastic about the t 10, because its ugly as all hell. And like i said before even when i had trinkets to use i always forgot about them when i needed them cause i was busy keeping people up and then when i remembered them i didn't need them.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this completely. Being stuck in tree form 24/7 and not even seeing a visual change when I get a cool new item was a big turn-off for me, and one of the reasons I ditched my resto druid.

<br />
ToL is simply going to be another CD druids use for harsh situations. It will not mean druids will be bad outside of ToL, and be on-par with today's druid only when under the effect of this cooldown. This change does not by any means mean a nerf to druids, but merely another gimmic for druids. <br />
<br />
To me, this change is very much welcome. The restoration tree never had any cooldowns until now. I wouldn't say Nature's Swiftness counts as one. With these changes all healers will have a gimmick such as this:<br />
<br />
Paladin: Divine Illumination, Avenging Wrath.<br />
Shaman: Unleash Earthliving.<br />
Priest: Guardian Spirit, Pain Suppression, Power Infusion*.<br />
Druid: Tree of Life.<br />
*Not self-only. Better used on another player as of now.<br />
<br />
Now, in my point of view, priests are the ones with the worst situational talents to improve their healing. Guardian Spirit and Pain Suppression are both really good abilities, but they both have a short duration and long cooldown. Then on the other hand, priests are getting Chakra, which seems truly awesome. <br />
<br />
Edit: Restoration is not getting any new spells. But they are getting a revamp which will make it work as a completely new spell. Tree of Life is the new restoration spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh dear, logic. How ever will I cope being a Tree of Natural Life and Flowing Crackling Arcane Energy of All Abilities Druids Have?<br />
<br />
Here is the issue. There is no way Blizzard could make a sensible argument for giving a Tree of Life the ability to use all the spells in a caster druids arsenal. Thus, the most logical thing to do is to remove the limiting factor for the overall goal, in this case, Tree of Life.<br />
<br />
This is a wonderful change, especially given the interesting mechanics that could be implemented with it. It doesn't take much to read some of the druid blogs and experience the scorn many players have towards the current ToL model and mechanic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trinkets can sometimes be difficult to remember as they are often chopped and changed. I'm sure you would remember a core mechanic with a lot more ease, letting the benefits it provides weave into your existing play style so you use it to your advantage, much as to how current Warlocks use Metamorphosis or when a raid feels the need for heroism or divine sacrifice.</div></div><hr />

You're absolutely correct. I have played Feral since original beta and I love looking at the same model(well updated a few times) every time I go to instances/raids.

It's also a means to likely break snares, deal with MS, etc. It will also mean druids will NOT be some uber, OP class (as usual) in pvp. You can finally sheep them, though they can cleanse sheep from a teammate (for example).<br />
<br />
These changes are nice, and they allow a resto druid to have some flavor and new mechanics to work with come the x-pak.<br />

p.s. - the pvp bias stab is most likely just a personal frustration based on the classes I play, who have had to deal with trees for years, who oftentimes teabag my toon after 15 minutes of attempting to kill them, only to have some crappy DoT like moonfire kill me.</div></div><hr />

Stop spamming. A lot of us prefer pre-tbc when Druids healed as bloody Druids and not some lame Tree. We did not sign up for this all those years ago.<br />

TREE FORM is nothing like BEAR or CAT form. It is an aritificial buff. When TREE FORM uses a new resource and dramatically changes the playstyle of a Druid, and is not just some useless art, then let me know!</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, I agree with the other poster that Tree Form isn't really a &quot;form&quot;, it is a &quot;buff' through a form that limits other abilities in a negative way. Moonkin Form was very much the same way, but was saved with the new Eclipse UI. Now it will feel much more like a new class instead of what Tree Form and Moonkin Form used to be: Outfits. So instead of changing the resource/UI of Trees, they made it a limited time buff which may do fun things that they haven't even mentioned yet. <br />
<br />
I assume it will be a huge armor boost<br />
Maybe unlimited nature's grasp charges while in tree form<br />
Maybe immune to any CC<br />

This change makes no negative difference to your healing (and you should be watching Grid anyway!) yet offers us the possibility of a cooldown for when things get really tough, making you stronger as a whole. It also allows the use of your non-restoration abilities without breaking form and losing the associated spellpower, an example of which could be cyclone-ing a mind controlled ally on Deathwhisper, rooting a rogue Blood Beast on Saurfang, applying Faire Fire due to the absence of a balance or feral druid, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nathanyel</div><div class="date">2010-04-10, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Especially the feral part feels rather lackluster in comparison to the previous previews, they could've gone a little more into the details, but that may be due to the still rather early development state.<br />
<br />
Thrash: Swipe plus bleed?<br />
Stampeding Roar: additional dash (dang, Worgen druids will be pretty fast) that works on the group - Drums of Speed (http://www.wowhead.com/item=29530) as a class ability? Burst Aspect of the Pack? The 10y range is restricting. Might have a use for encounters where the raid as a whole has to move, see Heigan Dance, the long cooldown might be softened by multiple druids using it (since caster druids would be able to use it as well and only lose one, maybe two GCDs)<br />
Reliable interrupt is actually the best-sounding change for cat so far, and yes, even in PvE.<br />
Buffing Mangle again? There are other ways to make feral dps more forgiving, some of which they might've hinted at later, but that was way too vague.<br />
Cat Mastery: sounds very good, though of course a special effect like the shadow's orbs would've been nice. Obviously &quot;Melee Critical Damage&quot; is the replacement of (half of) Predatory Instincts (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=33867), which would not fit into the new talent philosophy.<br />
Bear Mastery: Soooo we'll continue to stack Stamina, as it becomes an offensive stat as well for tanks... meh. I always liked a dodge/agi-focussed build, though that already died with 3.3, and likely won't come back.<br />
<br />
Last but not least Shroom Bomb... it's 4am over here, I was wondering whether I was seeing things when I read the name... even bears might use it to catch aggro on a predictable spawn.<br />

It also allows the use of your non-restoration abilities without breaking form and losing the associated spellpower, an example of which could be cyclone-ing a mind controlled ally on Deathwhisper, rooting a rogue Blood Beast on Saurfang, applying Faire Fire due to the absence of a balance or feral druid, etc.<br />

CUT DOWN THE TREES!<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I agree with the other poster that Tree Form isn't really a &quot;form&quot;, it is a &quot;buff' through a form that limits other abilities in a negative way. Moonkin Form was very much the same way, but was saved with the new Eclipse UI. Now it will feel much more like a new class instead of what Tree Form and Moonkin Form used to be: Outfits. So instead of changing the resource/UI of Trees, they made it a limited time buff which may do fun things that they haven't even mentioned yet. <br />
<br />
I assume it will be a huge armor boost<br />
Maybe unlimited nature's grasp charges while in tree form<br />
Maybe immune to any CC<br />
Give side effects to spells cast while in tree form<br />
Drop delicious apples as treats!<br />
<br />
Before you knock it, wait and see!<br />
<br />

i dont know where you raid but in icc i dont see many resto druids popping out of tree form because they cant do damage</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Tree of Life was also changed to a situational cooldown which may boost or improve our healing spells. This is fantastic in of its own right, even without the model being removed which just makes it even more delicious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
or<br />
<br />
A new mechanic, giving us a &quot;cooldown&quot; ability which we have been lacking for WotLK, further developing our healing and the intricacies and knowledge involved with it and a new flashy model that lets other healers know we are meaning business?<br />
<br />
Tough one right there. Please let me keep my brown log and strict 5+1 rotations(!)<br />
<br />
<br />
They could just update the model. <br />
<br />
And i dont want cooldowns as a healer, as a dps i love them, but as a healer i hate them</div></div><hr />

I guess I must admit, shamans are probably gonna be the most OP healers in cata from the looks of things.</div></div><hr />

A few pages ago I listed some examples. Tonight, I dropped out of Tree of Life on multiple occasions. We had a close kill on 10 man Marrowgar (Heroic) so I subbed out to add dps for the last 200,000 health as I new I could keep the tanks alive fine in caster form. On Lady Deathwhisper (heroic again although we could not kill her due to an all melee setup) I was dropping form to cyclone as needed and to aid with dps in bringing the boss into phase 2 before additional adds spawning.<br />
<br />
Similar situations do occur on other bosses as well and even more regularly on trash where a snap cyclone can make a massive difference.</div></div><hr />

I was referring to PvP. Yes it helped in PvP to prevent Poly, but in every other way it hurt. Disc priests and Holy pals can kill targets while healing themselves. It is much more difficult for a tree to do this. <br />
<br />
Also, if you &quot;don't care about pvp&quot; that is your problem. I'd say 75% of new 81-85 abilities are mostly PvP related for every class so far. Looks like Cata is gonna be at least 50% focused on pvp, if not more. I, for one, enjoy that. Plus, most classes don't need new swings, spells, or heals. They need new FUN abilities and tweaks on the old ones. So far, cata seems to be doing this marvelously!</div></div><hr />

Anyway, can't wait to see how it will work out in pvp^^ got some nasty traps in mind hrhrhr....<br />
<br />
<br />
/facepalm League of Legends mate, legends....<br />
<br />
but yes, its very close, missing the slow on it though, but in return gets a remote detonate. Wondering how long it will last.. Teemo's shrooms exist for 10 minutes<br />
<br />
also... no CD? can you put down tons of them in the tunnels in WSG and just passively nuke down any flagcarrier?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Both Cat and Bear form (the original two) bring up completely new abilities and resources (rage/energy instead of mana). This is what makes them different than just a &quot;buff&quot;. Like I said, Moonkin and Tree both just increased dmg/healing while restricting the other and called it a &quot;form&quot;. It really was just a restrictive model.<br />
<br />
At least Moonkin will now have a new UI associated with it which makes the form a little more than just a model with a buff attached to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Needs more info on this. Will the bed just heal the target it's under? If others stand in it will they get healed aswell? Or will it just heal others nearby for X amount for Y amount of time? Or is it there to make my FPS go down in raids even more :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
That might as well be a new healing spell. This has tons of potential. It should be OP enough to be able to stand in fire. ;P</div></div><hr />
