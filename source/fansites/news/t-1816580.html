Arena Skirmishes Bonus Event July 10 – 13<br />
Service Update July 10, 12:05 p.m. PDT - We are aware of an issue preventing the quest The Arena Calls from properly displaying your number of wins. Arena Skirmish wins are being correctly counted, and you will be able to complete the quest after your tenth win.<br />
<br />
Through the end of the day on Monday, Arena Skirmishes award triple bonus honor. There’s never been a better time to queue up for the Arena and crack some skulls. Keep an eye out for the event-only quest The Arena Calls. When you win 10 Arena matches, the quest awards 500 Conquest Points which do not count against your weekly Conquest Point maximum.<br />
<br />
In case you’ve never participated in an Arena Skirmish, here’s an easy how-to guide:<br />
<br />
From anywhere in-game, open the Group Finder (default hotkey: i)<br />
Select the Player vs. Player tab on the bottom of the window.<br />
Under Arena Battles, choose either 2v2 or 3v3.<br />
Click the Join Battle button to be matched up with teammates.<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s Arena PvP! Rush in and bash your opponents.<br />
<br />
Will you answer the call to battle?<br />
<br />

And if Warlocks can control/manipulate souls, which are undead, to haunt people, then they are technically practicing necromancy..<br />
I suppose that depends on your definition of necromancy, and it's ok to have your own. Control of souls vs. raising soulless UD. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/617753692859666432))<br />

<br />
abilities are non-canon?<br />
Of course you use souls, you have soul shards. You dont use them to raise the dead though. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/617748069967249408))<br />

You guys really need to change how you get credit for events. Dying when it was 5sec away from being completed and missing out suck<br />
Totally agree. Will work on fixing. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/617559646082088960))<br />

Pretty much ... those bugged/flaky/whatever beams are pretty messed up though<br />
<br />
I don't think the whale shark dropping two is going to make that suddenly viable each day. The fact that, and I keep hoping everyday that this will change, the shipyard equipment blueprints are not account wide is the only reason you can still get a group to kill that stupid thing. that will end soon though ...</div></div><hr />

Getting 10 a day is easy: go to Fangrila and do the 3 x challenges in the Challenger Arena there. You can even find groups for it (search for 'Rumble' in Premades). Killing the 3 NPCs gets you most of your Fel-Corrupted Apexis Fragments for the day. I always start there, then do the rest of my Tanaan dailies and 10 x Fel-Corrupted Apexis Fragments is so easy.</div></div><hr />

Last i checked, it was all still fiction and creative license regarding definitions of fictional constructs like &quot;necromancy&quot; is perfectly fine. The moment necromancy becomes fact, you can resume quibbling over definitions.... I'll be busy with prep for the ensuing zombie apocalypse.</div></div><hr />

Won't be no relaxing until the movie release. Knowing the Warcraft community, it will all be shot down and called horrible up until the movie releases and then it'll be called horrible and badly made for another year after hitting cinemas by these same &quot;fans&quot;. My hopes aren't at an all-time high either, but I'll be damned if I'mma spend the months before even watching the damned thing with condemning everything I see from it. <br />
<br />
Moving away from that, I really was hoping for a preview of Dominic Cooper as King Llane and Ben Foster as Medivh...can't wait to see what Ben makes of Medivh!<br />
<br />
Edit: Medivh!! Think I saw him in that picture!!</div></div><hr />

Yes, complain about the PR team going to comicon to do press for the movie. <br />
Because the PR team spends all that time balancing the classes.<br />
/facepalm</div></div><hr />

Maybe a better content could be a better decision.</div></div><hr />

The trailer I saw was a low quality and poor shot. What I could make out was a ton of orcs who were big ugly bastards with big teeth, wearing the type of armor you'd see in game. Guldan was recognisable, the dark portal looked like you'd expect. People are shitting on a film they know little about, and they wonder why Blizz has kept quiet about the film. <br />
<br />
I have to admit, I was worried that the film was going to look less like Warcraft and more like a Sunday afternoon family film. If people want to cry and bitch, then cry about no Warcraft 4 or about the lack of content outside of raiding. I could go on but you get the point. The film looks awesome atm, even better they haven't condensed the entire film in to the trailer.</div></div><hr />
