Patch 6.2 - Shipyard Costs<br />
Since we last looked at the shipyard (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4845-Garrison-Shipyards-Spec-Specific-Trinkets-Blue-Posts-Eventbrite-Blizzcon-Party), some of the placeholder costs have been reduced. <br />
<br />
Building the shipyard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38574-all-hands-on-deck) now costs 150 x Garrison Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources) and ~150 gold, down from 5,000 x Garrison Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources). Building your first ship (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/39055-ship-shape) now costs 150 x Garrison Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources), down from 1,000. Building subsequent ships now costs 300 x Garrison Resources (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/824-garrison-resources).<br />

The State of the Game - and Ideas to Fix it<br />
The impending sense that the game is dying is far from new; in WotLK people cried “bring back TBC!” in Cata people cried “bring back WotLK” and so on and so forth… But as someone who has played since TBC it's fairly clear this game is not what it used to be (in good and bad ways alike). Spend five seconds on the Twitch front page and WoW is so far down I wonder how many people even play (stream) this game anymore. Many of the top WoW streamers have either started playing much less, or quit altogether. Though we should not exclusively use the opinions of top streamers as a litmus test for the game as a whole, it is important to appropriately weigh the experiences of people who have played this game at a very high level, for a very long time. We should certainly not base our personal experiences of the game on who streams or doesn’t, but my experience has been largely the same. My once extremely active friends list has dwindled down to a couple of players who are rarely even online, some only logging on to do garrison chores.<br />
<br />
Despite these feelings, what GCDTV has been able to do has been an extremely good sign. Not only is it a venue for high level players to play and for anyone interest to watch, but it shows there is still hope for the game, and most importantly, what this community can do if a few people step up.<br />
<br />
Quoting Babbi: I !@#$ing love this game, well at least I used to. The main question is: WHAT HAS CHANGED? <br />
<br />
And that’s what I’d like to figure out. Inspired by numerous posts on these forums and Arenajunkies, I’d like to start an intelligent and calm discussion and try and figure out where this game has improved, where things have gone south, and what we (the community) and blizzard can hopefully do to address them. I’ve compiled praise, complaints, and suggestions from many, and though I don’t necessarily agree with all of them, I’ll include as many as I can because it is important to have a discussion on this topic. This will make observations on the game as a whole, but mostly focusing on PVP.<br />
<br />
II. TL;DR Version:<br />
There have been many improvements to streamline the game as a whole, but they have come at the cost of “MMORPGness” and immersion.<br />
<br />
PVP Problems<br />
Though the game is more balanced (meaning nearly every spec has a top tier comp), people seem to be having less fun.<br />
<br />
Burst damage is too high, sustained damage is too low, and burst/sustained healing is too high in comparison.<br />
<br />
That results in a meta that somehow both feels slow, and too fast. (Because people’s health spikes up and down significantly under CDs, yet nothing happens when CDs are down.)<br />
<br />
Dumb/unskilled CC still exists. CC breaks should have their model changed from reactive to proactive (used before CC hits, instead of breaking it after it lands).<br />
<br />
Too many defensive cooldowns perpetuates the current problems in the meta &amp; encourage training targets.<br />
<br />
Too many spells (damage and healing) that provide significant burst are instant casts.<br />
<br />
The number of interrupts in the game requires that there are many instant casts. (Add something like an interrupt DR so the game can be shifted back to casting.)<br />
<br />
Mana is no longer an integral part of arena, which forces dampening (bad mechanic) to end games. (Make healer mana relevant again, no longer need artificial fix.)<br />
<br />
Pruning abilities resulted in unfun mechanics at the core of many classes. (Rather than pruning damage rotations and niche abilities, mobility, passives, defensive cooldowns and CC breaks should have been removed/merged.)<br />
<br />
There is a difference between mechanics and tuning. Look at both and address bad mechanics as well as tuning.<br />
<br />
There are many tools the game has to make changes for the PVP community that only affect PVP.<br />
<br />
We as a community need to be more positive and helpful (in dealing both with ourselves and Blizzard). <br />
<br />

<br />
This was a very interesting read. Thanks for taking the time to put this together, as it obviously took a lot of work. I'll try to respond to what I can.<br />
<br />
Regarding pruning: we actually see a lot of conflicting feedback here, even in this thread. Players want their CC effects back (even niche ones like Scare Beast), but feel that the game has too much CC. Or they want burst damage toned down, but want us to give back abilities that contribute to burst (such as Colossus Smash for Fury).<br />
<br />
For example, this thread makes the argument that, due to pruning, players don't have enough options to respond to something another player is doing, which leads to predictable gameplay. It also makes the argument that classes have too many defensive cooldowns, too much mobility, too many CC breaks, and too many interrupts. Don't those two arguments contradict each other? If not, why don't they? Honest question; if I'm just missing something here, I want to know about it.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong -- we're very open to feedback about which abilities you feel shouldn't have pruned, and what you feel is missing from your class. Just be aware that if you feel like you're missing another CC or defensive ability, you're essentially asking for us to put more of those in the game.<br />
<br />
I also think it's dangerous to make the argument that niche options add a skill element. There was an example given of a Priest using Mind Soothe to eat Spell Reflect. That's definitely a good trick that a skilled player would use, but I would stop to question what exactly it is about that trick that makes it stand out.<br />
<br />
At least in my opinion, the difficult part in that example is recognizing that Spell Reflect is active and quickly casting something unimportant. Mind Soothe made an obvious choice, when it was available. Now that it isn't, you have to think about the potential repercussions of whatever spell you cast being reflected. Doesn't that actually add more skill to dealing with Spell Reflect? Again, honest question.<br />
<br />
I'll also stress the importance of remembering that there are a lot of people who play this game, with a lot of different playstyles, in a lot of different communities and sub-communities. That's not just a PvE vs PvP thing -- it happens even within the PvP community. While a multi-rank 1 Gladiator might like having a few niche abilities they only use in specific circumstances, an entry-level PvP'er could be turned off by having to learn so much about other classes they've never played. A nerf to a class that's over-performing in Arenas could make them completely undesirable in RBG's. The challenge to our designers is in finding ways to accommodate all of those players as much as possible, which often means making hard decisions to make the game better for one group but potentially less enjoyable for another.<br />
<br />
Now, having said all of that, let me try to get one final point across: we agree that PvP in WoD is not the best it could be. We think we made a lot of great changes, and we've seen a lot more people trying out PvP in this season, but there were certainly a few missteps. Perhaps more importantly, there were some very valuable lessons learned for the future.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't expect any huge, game-redefining changes in Patch 6.2, but that doesn't mean we aren't listening and acting on your feedback, and taking it to heart as we make our plans for what comes next.

<br />
Because being able to solo content as 10 DKs has always required some of the best gear and the best players. You can't just find 10 random DKs, give them voice chat and win. It's never been that simple. Current-game solo has never been that simple, for death knights or not.<br />
<br />
Back in Wrath and Cata we had Raegwynn wiping out bosses left and right but he was a tank with Heroic gear in a decent Heroic progression guild. The entry costs are high.</div></div><hr />

Better 7.0 come rather quick, because at this point in 11 years, this was the game content with the least player activity thus far.<br />

Too many defensive cooldowns perpetuates the current problems in the meta &amp; encourage training targets.<br />
<br />
Too many spells (damage and healing) that provide significant burst are instant casts.<br />
and then<br />
<br />
Pruning abilities resulted in unfun mechanics at the core of many classes. (Rather than pruning damage rotations and niche abilities, mobility, passives, defensive cooldowns and CC breaks should have been removed/merged.)<br />

That made zero sense, it should be the opposite otherwise you playing the game for wrong reasons. Its like saying that i dont enjoy playing soccer because i get turned off by how good a professional soccer player is. Its the opposite, when i see a cool move and want to learn it myself.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2015-05-05, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Someone really needs to make a similar State of the Game thread regarding PvE, about streamlining, leveling being so easy that you feel completely uninvested in your character, talents every 15 levels quickly making you feel like everything is spoonfed to you, Garrison being way too self-sufficient, removal of attunements/faction rewards/necessary world mats for professions/hidden rewards all stomp out all world activity because you can achieve pretty much the same standing still browsing lists of pugs/LFD/LFR.<br />
<br />
WoW suffers tremendously from this paradox of removal of dull elements (attuning, unlocking difficulties, faction farms for worthwhile items, keys, certain gear thresholds) making people bored, because many player-friendly changes over the years, cutting down on things you &quot;don't want to do&quot; makes you not appreciate what you achieve. Do you think you can only feel satisfied hitting max level once or twice before it's just nostalgia? Leveling has reduced a ton of clutter, made it more fair, giving classes all the tools they need early, side-effects of overhauls has left almost everything in the world complete pushovers. There were times when you actually had to THINK for a moment to avoid getting overrun and killed. You learned from mistakes, you actively engaged to conquer obstacles. Now you run from mob to mob, one-shotting, able to remove your healthbar because it's irrelevant, and this makes you frustrated whenever you're not progressing as fast as you can, because all challenge is effectively removed. Which also makes other players obstacles and not potential aid/friends because you sure don't need to party up and have an incentive to chat and help each other.<br />
<br />
But the discussion is completely neutered because people just think &quot;oh it was never hard just time consuming&quot;. You're wrong, but you refuse to see why. And that's understandable. It's a shit ton of factors together that has created this situation.<br />
<br />
We don't ever want to feel left out when we happened to play a class that wasn't needed in a particular setting, so we got the Bring Player Not The Class treatment, that has sadly reduced everyone to tank/healer/dps... and in a wider sense that is a good thing, that we no longer think that X boss MUST be tanked by a paladin, or you NEED atleast 3 druids on Y fight to combat constant raid damage... but it takes away flavor.<br />
<br />
And the Garrison... Blizzards complete paradigm shifts incarnate. Truly the Garrison and Draenor world content is the epitome of &quot;choice&quot; that the players &quot;craved&quot; in MoP. Where we felt &quot;forced&quot; to do &quot;mandatory&quot; tasks in order to catch up. So that's gone. Pretty much nothing in Draenor is enticing once you've passed 630. We didn't want to have raid level items &quot;gated&quot; behind factions, so we lost that carrot-on-stick to care about factions. Hell I don't even know where half the quartermasters are. I have no reason to care.<br />
<br />
I do blame this paradox, this constant urge for Blizzard to &quot;improve&quot; our experience, but together takes away something you cannot put in words. Players just do not care anymore, because effort is no longer rewarded outside of top-level arena or raids. <br />
<br />
Success is guaranteed until you hit normal raids.<br />
You think that makes the game engaging?</div></div><hr />

Your second statement merely shows how little Blizzard cares about everything that is not raiding. They dumped the difficulty so that EVERYONE can do it w/o much hassle and called it a day.</div></div><hr />

No its like getting turned off because some professional soccer players stomped over your soccer team which is certainly not fun for entry level PvPers, especially those who are considering alts.<br />

<br />
Oh my, where to begin? Shall I start back in Wrath? Cata? Mop? Or the WoD PTR pre-release?<br />
<br />
How about something trivial: Garrisons won't be required.<br />
<br />
Tannan jungle comes out .. &quot;you'll need a level 3 garrison&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, I know both of you may be new to WoW so I'll just say SoO (Siege of Orgrimmar) lasted OVER A YEAR. Before SoO there was DS (Dragon Soul) which was released in late 2011. MoP (Mists of Pandaria) was released in early October 2012. Now, they claimed during DS and ICC (which later had a pitiful RS (Ruby Sanctum) which developers through in out of sheer stupidity, in my opinion) that they didn't want final tiers lasting THAT long.<br />
<br />
Instead, what do they do? They make final tiers last LONGER. L-O-N-G-E-R.<br />
<br />
Their excuse? Their team was being brought up to speed. We &quot;believed&quot; it up until we got LESS content than ever and now see less and less in patches that aren't happening more frequently to justify their team size.<br />
<br />
Remember how it was *implied* flying would happen after 6.1 probably maybe kind of sort of and the community totally believed it? Funny that. Would you be surprised to never see flying in any xpac ever again? Funny that. Now, if you suggest let's not ban mounting up -- and force people to run or walk, your thread gets deleted magically. Not locked -- DELETED. Sit and think about that.<br />
<br />
So yeah... excuse me if I'm skeptical of them being honest, they don't have a history of being even remotely accurate or even being able to hold their word.<br />
Now since you're not a developer you might not understand this: There's a difference between we can't/won't do it and we can't do it within this time frame.<br />
<br />
They HAD to get WoD out so they ditched many features. If they had let SoO run another 6 months or more it would have tanked wow.<br />
<br />
Also, and this is important so take it to heart, how a community reacts shouldn't control you. If your skin isn't thick enough to handle it, and Lore has proven his isn't, then get out of the kitchen if that fire is too hot.<br />
<br />
They all but refuse the help of people who take PvP seriously. They all but refuse to actually address PvP in a serious way. So yeah, that &quot;honest criticism&quot; they claim they want -- I call bullshit. They aren't putting forth an honest effort. They aren't reaching out. They are playing PR in the most horrible of ways.<br />
<br />
My personal bets? They put a programmer in a leadership / managerial position who doesn't know how to do either of those and right now they are digging a nasty hole for themselves.</div></div><hr />

No its like getting turned off because some professional soccer players stomped over your soccer team which is certainly not fun for entry level PvPers, especially those who are considering alts.<br />
<br />
Its also clear thorough blue forum posts that PvP participation has increased in WoD so there is some logic to that statement.<br />
Maybe random BG's and Ashran but as of a few months ago there was a 30% decrease in arena activity and the ladders have stagnated; I'd wager it's only gotten worse at this point especially on Horde where I couldn't get into a yolo RBG for 4 days in the evening. (Full Conquest Gear + Multi 2200 - Literally just trying to cap.)<br />
Players at the top don't even queue anymore due to MMR changes and they'd rather sit glad and play alts; At 2k-2400 range. Where people are trying to learn/climb.<br />
<br />
There are so many issues with PvP in this game it's pretty much beyond the point of repair.<br />
They keep saying they're learning but what are they learning? That ignoring the Duelist/1 time Glad level player is working or something? That Ashran is super super fun and all we want? - They're letting rated play rot with cheating and the same few players piloting/camping the ladder with alts to the point there's literally no incentive to play anymore.<br />

I would feel terrible if I was stuck on heroic BRF right now.<br />
<br />
It is not the same heroic &quot;BRF&quot; since the ilvl upgrade for all gear. So yes, you can basically stomp heroic BRF with mythic BRF gear since it was designed for &quot;almost&quot; 680, but not 700+</div></div><hr />

Garrisons are sooo anti-social feels like your trapped in there and there is no reason to leave, everything is done through the garrison in some part. Garrisons also caused the loss of a major city for each faction in WOD. the lack of flying mounts also adds to the isolation imo<br />

TL;DR garrisons anti-social cancer content killed WoW<br />

(and as for PvP its been a joke in wow for a long time, they should just drop it and stop &quot;attempting&quot; to balance it at the expense of PvE)</div></div><hr />

There's a lot of truth to this. The garrison is fun but it does make WoW feel very much like a single player game. It also feels like it is most of what there is to do at high level and you can spend half your play time running around doing daily garrison housekeeping. Farm your herbs, farm your mine, do your pet daily, restock your shipments, manage your missions, vendor all the crap you picked up. If, like most players, you have an alt or two as well this can take best part of an hour to do each day at which point you have spent a lot of time on a pointless grind, haven't seen a single other player and are probably feeling utterly bored and frustrated at the fact that this is literally almost the only thing to do if you don't have a raid scheduled.</div></div><hr />

In Rift I spent hours finding new items for my dimension, tweaking it making it mine, then I would invite people there and pvp, complete with a scorboard and announcer. Yes in rift you can have your own private BG. THAT is player housing. <br />
Similar in LotRo. Going out to find trophies and cool decorations added to the game. <br />
Sadly blizzard came up with the worst, least customizable PH I have ever seen.<br />
PH Is not the problem, shitty implementation of PH is the problem.</div></div><hr />

Garrisons are NOT player housing. Player housing is what you have in Rift, Wildstar, and many others. Garrisons are a glorified daily hub with the choice between 5 useful buildings.</div></div><hr />

you put it better than I did tbh. <br />
I really enjoyed mop and played like an addict through the whole expansion, I quit wod a few months ago I do miss wow but the thought of logging in and being in that single player prison is sooo off putting I doubt I will resub in WoD ... when wod was announced at blizcon my mind was blown, but when they spent the whole panel talking about garrisons I started to worry, and clearly they where well founded worries.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand what they were thinking, how did they ever think garrisons where a good idea. out of all the experienced devs at bliz how could none of them see what a terrible idea it was.... im sure there are no players who would rather keep garrisons over something else (be it faction major cities or anything else)<br />
<br />
In vanilla devs didn't listen to the whine, now they do just look at the contrast :/</div></div><hr />

Way to dumb down the game more. I guess you should be able to get a shipyard at lvl 90 then eh? Sickens me that everyone has access to everything without putting in any effort. Mythic raiding is the last minor medium in which real mmorpg gamers can distinguish - of course they give out mythic gear without ever killing a mythic boss either.<br />

<br />
Personally, I love the garrison system. You don't have to be OCD about everything that goes on in the garrison, you CAN let work orders bottom out and then fill them back up a few days later, it's not like there's a massive penalty for not refilling the work orders. You don't even really have to fill out or collect your missions more than once a day. It only takes me like half an hour to do four characters worth of garrison chores per day.<br />
<br />
Garrisons are not the main problem with WoD. The problem is we need a reason to leave them other than raiding. The content in WoD is bone dry. The rep grinds are extremely tedious and pointless. There are no daily hubs and the one daily we had is boring as hell and became massively irrelevant once people realized how worthless apexis crystals are. Ashran is utter trash. (Seriously, a PvP zone where the main objective is worthless and side events are zerg fests?) Without the ability to fly, few people give enough of a crap to do activities out in Draenor like archeology, fishing and pet battles either.<br />
<br />
TL;DR If you want people to do something besides sit in their garrisons, there needs to be something for them to do outside it.</div></div><hr />

All the good changes will be in next xpac i hope&quot;,but in wod the pvp is kinda bad so atm they cant do anyting about this just w8 for new xpac.<br />
<br />
I have read a lot of post over the years that simply state wait until the expansion, the one after that and the one after that and so on and so forth. This is what Blizzard banks on that people will just to continue to hang on and it why the get the swing in subs they do every expansion. What looks somewhat cool on paper for many, end up simply sucking balls when they play it and continue to play it for any length of time. It seems they should just stick to making raid content at this point, they seem to do at least a fine job of creating those types of environments and just simply scrap the rest. WoD world content after leveling, simply blows.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WernerCD</div><div class="date">2015-05-05, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&gt; I'll also stress the importance of remembering that there are a lot of people who play this game, with a lot of different playstyles, in a lot of different communities and sub-communities. That's not just a PvE vs PvP thing -- it happens even within the PvP community. While a multi-rank 1 Gladiator might like having a few niche abilities they only use in specific circumstances, an entry-level PvP'er could be turned off by having to learn so much about other classes they've never played. A nerf to a class that's over-performing in Arenas could make them completely undesirable in RBG's. The challenge to our designers is in finding ways to accommodate all of those players as much as possible, which often means making hard decisions to make the game better for one group but potentially less enjoyable for another.<br />
<br />
This means that it's to easy for a Veteran to play... but too hard for a newblet...<br />
<br />
So THAT means that in the expansion, well get LFPvP, HeroicPVP, MythicPVP? Where LFPvP is stand still, whoever smashes buttons faster wins! and Mythic requires actual skill?<br />
<br />
After all... it's just damn important that all players can experience all things... so N00bs need to be able to &quot;win&quot; at PVP and then work their way up to real PVP?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ronaldmc</div><div class="date">2015-05-06, 10:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that the Garrison system made most of the game feel like a single player game. Interacting with people is key to an MMO. The new missions in the garrison to fight bosses, get Harrison Jones as a folllower, etc helped a bit because I see people asking in the chats to visit each other's Garrison, but the visiting lasts almost zero time (go, talk to or kill npc, bye). In a world where people would interact, I would expect mutual beneficial and extended interactions. Invasions work wonders IMO, but they could be more varied (for example, an aerial attack where people would need to jump rooftops or fire cannons, or drive around the garrison, etc).<br />
<br />
Another major thing I miss are active professions. To create items we had to trade (a lot) with people, go to different parts of the world, collect, level, hunt recipes and wait for cooldowns. Today we have only the cooldown part and everything else is connected to it. Log in, use cooldown, put work orders up, wait. Rinse and repeat until you have 100, 200 to create an item. Done with profession. That's not fun, that is not challenging, it doesn't make you go to AH, talk to people, spam trade chat, walk the world. Maybe a bit, but not as much as before.<br />
<br />
As for the classes, I like the pruning to core gameplay skills so they aren't unbalanced... However, I did like having situational side skills. I started playing a priest because it was &quot;different&quot;. It could mind control people and mobs (so much fun throwing dungeon minions at each other or throwing a player off-cliff), they could mind soothe mobs you didn't want to face or players for extra challenge while hunting you (the thrill of not knowing if it would be enough), shackle undead would give an extra thing to do in specific fights (you had this extra button you would use 1/20 of the time but it made the game feel different at that little while).<br />
<br />
Extras for extra pushing &gt; &quot;Looking for people&quot; features are amazing to allow more players to participate in more content and experience story, but don't forget that you also have to stimulate that extra push. If you play normal mode, you get extra story, extra cinematic, better equip, extra quest. If you go mythic you get extra boss, extra mechanics, extra cosmetic items, extra achievement, etc... The extras don't need to be core story, core equipment, core must haves. But they can be side ones that make the core parts feel more whole and fulfilling. So, for example... in the Garona questline, we could have extras (in dgs, raids, quests, archeology or whatever) showing a bit of her background story. It is not a core thing but it adds to it if you push a bit more.<br />
<br />
Just coming up with ideas as I write. Hope I didn't bring up a bunch of crap, haha</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">elvor0</div><div class="date">2015-05-06, 11:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh my, where to begin? Shall I start back in Wrath? Cata? Mop? Or the WoD PTR pre-release?<br />
<br />
How about something trivial: Garrisons won't be required.<br />
<br />
Tannan jungle comes out .. &quot;you'll need a level 3 garrison&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, I know both of you may be new to WoW so I'll just say SoO (Siege of Orgrimmar) lasted OVER A YEAR. Before SoO there was DS (Dragon Soul) which was released in late 2011. MoP (Mists of Pandaria) was released in early October 2012. Now, they claimed during DS and ICC (which later had a pitiful RS (Ruby Sanctum) which developers through in out of sheer stupidity, in my opinion) that they didn't want final tiers lasting THAT long.<br />
<br />
Instead, what do they do? They make final tiers last LONGER. L-O-N-G-E-R.<br />
<br />
Their excuse? Their team was being brought up to speed. We &quot;believed&quot; it up until we got LESS content than ever and now see less and less in patches that aren't happening more frequently to justify their team size.<br />
<br />
Remember how it was *implied* flying would happen after 6.1 probably maybe kind of sort of and the community totally believed it? Funny that. Would you be surprised to never see flying in any xpac ever again? Funny that. Now, if you suggest let's not ban mounting up -- and force people to run or walk, your thread gets deleted magically. Not locked -- DELETED. Sit and think about that.<br />
<br />
So yeah... excuse me if I'm skeptical of them being honest, they don't have a history of being even remotely accurate or even being able to hold their word.<br />
Now since you're not a developer you might not understand this: There's a difference between we can't/won't do it and we can't do it within this time frame.<br />
<br />
They HAD to get WoD out so they ditched many features. If they had let SoO run another 6 months or more it would have tanked wow.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First up, no, I've been playing almost consistantly since Vanilla, I skipped Cata and that was about it. I was more specifically talking about them referring to SoO when they said they don't want tiers lasting that long and that they haven't broken that yet. I quite frankly don't remember what they said back in 2007 about ICC because that was 7 years ago and remembering what a Blizzard blue said 7 years ago about anything isn't something I hold to my memory. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to argue at all about WoD and the time it took. I agree that for the time it took, launch content was and is woeful. <br />
<br />
No, they didn't imply that 6.1 would have flying. Some blues said that it's something they were thinking about it as a possibility. That isn't implying, that's saying they're thinking about it and when they'd thought about it, they decided to not put it in. Granted, there's a lot of situations where they'd said they want to get something out and it didn't happen, but that's actually a prime example of what you quoted me for. Someone saying they're thinking about it, is NOT a fucking promise or an implication that this is going to happen. Hold Blizzard responsible for stuff like welching on not having the final tier last as long by all means, but it irritates me that like I said, they take a passing comment about flying in 6.1 and take it as red that it IS going to happen. <br />
<br />
Personally I don't see what Lore is supposed to do. If he commits to a statement and the devs can't keep up with that, it makes the company look bad and Lore gets the fire. If he's not commiting to definitive statements, he's accusing of being a spin doctor. It's a really crap position to deal with. Yes, Blizzard need to do better and like I said, hold them accountable when they've done something contrary to what they've definitely said they will do. But the WoW community is toxic as all hell, and again like I said, will knee jerk at the slightest provocation about anything and are completely unable to differenciate between &quot;we'd LIKE to&quot; or &quot;It's something we're considering&quot; and &quot;We WILL&quot;<br />
<br />

5000 GR is fine for older characters, but if you've just dinged, that's 8k worth of garrison resources you need to get to Tannan(5k for shipyard, 1k for boat and 2k for lvl 3 Garrison); a questing area. Don't be fucking rediculous. Oh no, they can get to the questing zone, THE HORROR. Seriously, why does it matter that the SHIPYARD is easy to get? It's wasn't difficult to get before either, it was just time consuming and had no player input. Sitting there waiting for garrison resources to pile up isn't effort, skill or meaningful to any degree. It's just waiting for something to happen and NOTHING else. Dat effort. &quot;I sat around and had a wank while my garrison stockpile fillled up and waited for my followers to come back from a mission, fear my acomplishments!&quot; This has to be most laughably terrible argument I have ever seen for the game being dumbed down.</div></div><hr />
