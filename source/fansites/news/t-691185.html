<meta name="description" content="Important - Patch 3.3.2 is not this week 
After checking with a few people, I can confirm that Patch 3.3.2 will not be deployed this week. It also means that Season 8 will not start this week either, as the season cannot start without the patch.  
 
At this point I'm not sure if it means that we will also have to wait one more week to fight the Lich King. It all depends on whether Blizzard wants to release the encounter and the new season on the same day.

Patch 3.3.2 Patch Notes<br />
A couple of hours ago the korean patch notes appeared on my forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/general-discussions-22/3-32-minor-patch-notes/), I was happily waiting to get an english version but apparently it will be harder than expected. <br />
<br />
I really hate to post that kind of translated notes because the most complicated changes might have translation errors, be careful with them. I'll try to get an english version up as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
However I had the translation double checked and these notes should be fairly accurate, even if Blizzard's version will look nicer.<br />
Dungeon and Raid<br />
Icecrown Citadel<br />
The Scourge and the Lich King's last hold, Frostwing Hall will be added to the game. However, in order to enter the wing, the Ashen Verdict must shatter the barrier first.<br />
<br />
Halls of Stone<br />
Since Brann Bronzebeard exercised constantly, he will walk faster during the escort.<br />
<br />
Forge of Souls<br />
Devourer of Souls will cast Mirrored Soul less frequently.<br />
Trash mobs Spell Reflect abilities have been changed. It now has a cast time, 2 charges, and chance to reflect reduced to 75% from 100%<br />

Some monsters between Jedoga Shadowseeker and Herad Volazj have been removed.<br />
<br />
Pit of Saron<br />
Dead players are now able to enter the dungeon during Krick and Ick or Forgemaster Garfrost encounter.<br />
<br />
Utgarde Pinnacle<br />
Players only need 3 harpoons to bring down Skadi’s drake during the encounter. (Down from 5)<br />
Svala Sorrowgrave now casts Rituals of Sword only once. (Down from 3)<br />
<br />
Vault of Archavon<br />
Toravon the Icewatcher has been added to the Vault of Archavon. He awaits your challenge in both 10 and 25 man difficulty<br />
<br />
Violet Hold<br />
New portals will open faster after players defeat bosses<br />
<br />

<br />
They better seriously make an enormous overhaul on 5man heroics for Cata they have been a complete joke since day one in wrath offering no challenge nor demands in CC, marking, level headed pulling or skill. And every tier they become a faceroll for the previous tiers free gear, free 232 and frosts good job.<br />
<br />
Kind of nice for the patch not to be this week, I mean bad for the pvp'ers ofc because that is your thing and like the pve'ers you need new content to make your playing worthwhile, but VOA boss will be a joke and reward 264 tier which is BS and defeats the objective of killing end wing bosses for tokens to unlock 264.</div></div><hr />

* The Scourge and the Lich King's last hold, Frostwing Hall will be added to the game. However, in order to enter the wing, the Ashen Verdict must shatter the barrier first.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like it will be added, but not available.<br />
<br />
I've always thought there will be a final barrier between the Frostwing bosses and the lich king.<br />
<br />
This could put an extra ~2 weeks on this instance, before we see the lich king (i.e give us 2 weeks to kill sindra and dreamwalker).</div></div><hr />

The wording on this is quite shady. <br />
<br />
It unlikely means there will be even longer before we can enter the wing so does it mean we will actually have one more barrier between us and Lich King? Or is it only there to further describe why until now we haven't been able to enter? I am leaning towards the latter as the throne area is unlikely called &quot;wing&quot;, but I'll wait for the English notes.</div></div><hr />

Arena Season 8 was supposed to start one week after the end of Season 7. <br />
<br />
Season 8 models aren't in patch 3.3 and have to be introduced in Patch 3.3.2.<br />
<br />
= Patch should have been January 26th, they probably postponed because of a last minute bug and this is why Blizzard never announces patches, that kind of stuff just happens.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you're obviously not a caster. I can barely DPS on those stupid skeleton guys in FoS because I know as soon as Missile Barrage procs and I cast it, those stupid reflect shields are going to suddenly pop up while 5 missiles are in mid-air and bounce right back at me, killing me. I've also killed someone before on the Devourer of Souls for the same reason, Mirrored Souls popping up while 5 missiles are in the air and there's not a thing I can do to stop them. Tell me what DPS or healer has over 30 000 HP and will survive that? <br />
<br />
As for all the Heroic nerfs, they were necessary as well, as when you have 4 lvl 80s in full tier 9+, Heroics are so damned boring. I hate Violet Hold, it puts me to sleep.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how exactly this is going to be coded. When the DoT receives the additional duration, does the game treat the spell as though it were just cast, or does it continue to tick using the damage values present when it was first cast.<br />
<br />
Either way, if I know elemental and I'm sure I don't, you still won't be able to maintain a rolling flame shock indefinitely, but you could still maintain it for a bit longer.</div></div><hr />

MMO Champion and the 'rest of the internet' don't have some super secret source inside Blizzard telling them whats going to happen. They have the same info that is available to anyone who looks for it and they compile it to one source and make educated guesses from there. <br />
<br />
Every arena season so far has had one week between the end of one and the start of another. We knew the arena season was going to end soon so they were able to make estimates from there and narrow it down has time went by. After the season ended they were then able to use Blizzards past behavior and make an educated guess on when the new patch would come out. <br />
<br />
Blizzard changed their previous pattern.</div></div><hr />

The Scourge and the Lich King's last hold, Frostwing Hall will be added to the game. However, in order to enter the wing, the Ashen Verdict must shatter the barrier first.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know, for sure, what said barrier is exactly? Downing the other wings?<br />
<br />
And I'm assuming not, but did Blizz have anything to say about the Lich King fight being available directly after Sindragosa's death? Or is there more gating to be expected?<br />

After checking with a few people, I can confirm that Patch 3.3.2 will not be deployed this week. It also means that Season 8 will not start this week either, as the season cannot start without the patch. <br />
<br />
At this point I'm not sure if it means that we will also have to wait one more week to fight the Lich King. It all depends on whether Blizzard wants to release the encounter and the new season on the same day.<br />

I will give you an example of which achievment will be harder with that change.<br />
In UP on second boss (Svala Sorrowgrave) the abomination which should be killed by her (The Incredible Hulk) will be harder becouse you will have only one attemp to kill him. With all the damage and aoe (happy trigger morons) done nowadays good luck with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They better seriously make an enormous overhaul on 5man heroics for Cata they have been a complete joke since day one in wrath offering no challenge nor demands in CC, marking, level headed pulling or skill. And every tier they become a faceroll for the previous tiers free gear, free 232 and frosts good job.<br />
<br />
Kind of nice for the patch not to be this week, I mean bad for the pvp'ers ofc because that is your thing and like the pve'ers you need new content to make your playing worthwhile, but VOA boss will be a joke and reward 264 tier which is BS and defeats the objective of killing end wing bosses for tokens to unlock 264.<br />
<br />
<br />
qft<br />
<br />
i suppose icc is better then sitting in one room at toc, what ever happened to the great dungeons like ST, BRD, even Kara? please blizzard bring that back. the little things matter the most, we like detail and variety.<br />
<br />
i know things have gotten extremely casual, but i'm sure blizz has a perfectly good reason for making it so. $$$<br />
<br />
then there's the issue with pvp/pve. they've said they would have to overhaul everything to focus on each aspect individually, so that making changes to balance one does not affect the other. this should have been done such a long time ago, even before bc came out. they simply weren't prepared, now they are playing catch up while they slap one band aid after band aid. <br />
<br />
lets hope they admit these are issues they intend to work on and take them seriously. i would so love to see cata be successful and resurrect my love for the game. <br />
<br />
call it a joke, meh.. a time dump regardless, but what isn't in life.</div></div><hr />

And that matters because you couldn't already get a protodrake by luck from the Oracles or by buying a zillion mounts for jousting every day or a dragonhawk mount for freeing a few captured idiots and killing 15 lv 80s that are no challenge before? So you actually had to do 3 weeks of dailies that took you 15 minutes to complete and you could buy loads of stuff from marks. I don't see how that is different from easily obtaining another differently colored mount?<br />
<br />
Does it deprive you of your special position in this game now? How about how easy it is now to get a Bronze drake? Whoha..another 280% mount that nobody ever uses...?<br />
<br />
Serious folks...aren't we a bunch of sad losers? You piss and moan about changes to bloody outdated content and I piss and moan about you pissing and moaning...</div></div><hr />

Stupid and doesn't belong here. Half the QQers in different threads claim here that Blizzard is losing customers because the challenge is gone and the game is too casual, the other half of QQers claim the game was casualized to make more money. How does that work?<br />
<br />
I am sure guys like you will be happy when you finally get your wish and need to invest 3 hours in a full Kara clear for 2 Frost emblems or whatever the equivalent of this will be in Cataclysm.<br />

it belongs anywhere and everywhere. my qq is your qq as you've just proven. certain changes have obviously been made to appease certain types of gamers is all, blizz like any other great company uses sales techniques, i just think sometimes their perceptive on what is a proper change is miscalculated. <br />
<br />
love to hate this game? actually this is the only mmorpg i've ever played besides diablo. i came from css to wow, and i do love the game, i just feel that some people including myself feel neglected. i'm sure there are others that feel the same way.<br />

i really hope they dont listen to you and retards that want CC in heroics. it sucks marking every dam trash in that instance just to get through it. BTW wrath heroics weren't all that easy when they came out, why do you think people were traumatized of oculus. As far as I remember the hard ones (the ones ppl usually tried to avoid) were 1.Oculus, 2.OK, 3.AN, 4.HoS, and 5.UP</div></div><hr />

That means we dont have to refresh anymore the FS on the target, or at least very few times.<br />

The FS actually last 18 sec and we can cast 3 LvB during that time, so with the bonus we are gonna have another 18 sec duration on FS and so on...</div></div><hr />

There are some easy hc's already imo like vh or the one with anub those are easy ... even oculus is lol now 12 mins pugged , 12 mins for 8 triumph maybe a drake and easy ?

Even a fresh 80 just uses them for badge runs. Its not like the gear wont be upgraded in a few days. At least Blizz is recognizing what people want to do and not hindering it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering that the emblem changes are mostly for new players to join the game and catch up, imagine what they'll learn now and QQ about on Cataclysm... &quot;what? shouldn't heroics be 10 min runs? Wtf?!&quot;.<br />
<br />
They should remove the Red Proto Drake from the Glory of the Hero like they did with Naxx ones... same reason (and worse for heroics since they're nerfing the achievements). Probably even move the Heroic Achievements to Feat of Strenght panel after the 1st time they transformed those into lolchievements.<br />
<br />
And looks like ppl really have a hard time in FoS... thinking and reacting to spellreflects and mirrors... well, that's what Blizzard got with their new philosophy... players who burn all their CDs when the game says to NOT attack... lol...<br />
<br />
And btw, can't blame Blizzard if they're postponning... they probably want to do it all at once instead of 2 downloads in a row or giving all the candy to dataminers before it's actually possible to reach and defeat the Lich King (they said that they've put a lot of effort in that cutscene...).</div></div><hr />

Sarcasim? Personally i think they need a new hotfix for astral shift for shamans, next cast within 10seconds becomes instant is defently a decent buff. WTF QQ stunlock *instant heal* Theres surviability? bout time ele shamans got one there burst is already top notch with the wtf lava blast 15k crits in relentless.<br />
<br />
I dont even play shamans and know they need some buffing but hex is just stupid it needs a nerf for the decent buff i sujested make damage break the damn cc before i bubble and hearthstone.<br />
<br />
As for prot... haha losers he dmg needs a nerf with the intercept shield bash wtf silence crit a clothie like a mofo. Dmg needed a nerf seen mages die in a shield bash unless they are frost. Give prot palas a bleed effect tho for plate pvp... dmg nerf yay for clothies u dont got pwned but they gunna get facerolled now by other plate wearers.<br />
<br />
pve wise im looking forward to voa boss's why you ask? I like raiding, 2days after reset im saved totc25, totgc25, totgc10, icc10, icc25 and voa25. Im bored for a weak! No other upgrades for me and unless its icc im only after god dman trink from totc25 or shield upgrade right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
on that topic gear is far to easy to get now... played pre tbc i didnt mind waiting 2 months to get my damn bloodfang hem (kept losing roll to other rogues ¬_¬ but i wont QQ i just took it out on alliance backstab style) Im really looking forward to cata this may be lame to some but the recycleing blizzard does... recycle old raids just give them 85 versions keep tactics the same would see alot of crys from &quot;lbrs is to hard waaa&quot; to &quot;you know blizzard i knew i loved you for a reason&quot;</div></div><hr />

Can't even think on that... I prefer to think that they WON'T do that, because... they alread did it trough the entire expansion, nerfing raids and heroics after each patch...

When all they are doing is make them less time consuming. Why is it that everyone keeps saying adding cc to hcs will make them harder? The trash in hcs can be made hard by adding a lot of different mechanics, instead of &quot;sheep&quot; and &quot;sap.&quot; When was sheeping and saping still standing mobs hard? It was just unnecessary waste of time. You ppl didn't do hcs in tbc with a prot pala? You didn't need cc when a prot pala was tanking hcs. They only thing missing back then was the easy aoe every class can do now. <br />
<br />
Edit: Having to cc every pack in tbc hcs resulted in class stacking in order to complete them. It often occurs to me that ppl who are whining about cc'ing in hcs are often mages and rogues.</div></div><hr />

If your dps is extremely low you should optimize the used spells and your gear. Our 2 enhancers are both in the top 10 of the DDs(of course it is depending on the encounter) but an average position 4 is possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would like that blizz start to make real hard raid. I remember how much time i farmed fire resist gear. nature resist gear, Frost resist gear. in that time you did not have 3 piece that capped you in a resistance. You had to farm dungeon, drop, things like living essence four hours etc... But when you were finaly 40 with some kind of FR gear, finaly you could kill that boss.<br />
<br />
Now its just get that good gear. dps that boss, go to the next....<br />
<br />
where are the long farm days for a raid for weapon stones, oil, for flask. Now its just to easy, you can craft flask everywhere! that just dumb, any noob can create a fucking flask ? where is the fun with that. Before you had to go in BWL or Scholomance to craft your flask. That was epic<br />
<br />
Now its so stupid, you can get your tank Def cap before entering a raid. In Vanilla, the tank had to kill raid boss to get drop so he could start getting def gear.... this is just too easy now... <br />
<br />
Also right now, you can see what spec your tank have and can say WTF NOOB GO PROT. In Vanilla, you had no fucking idea what was the spec of your tank !!! <br />
<br />
Also there is no true boss fight like Nefarian when every member in your raid had to equip a Onyxia scale cloak that you had to farm on onyxia to be able tu survive when he landed...<br />
<br />
<br />
Man blizz, stop making wow a game for Dumb ppl....<br />

And to the person whining about the new raid systems and ease of obtaining gear... first of all.. please look up the definition of irony. If you put [irony:on] then qq for 6 paragraphs the [irony:on] would imply that you don't actually mean any of it,.. which I find hard to believe as you went on and on and on.. But to put it simply: you are confusing people having to be skilled to raid with people having ungodly amounts of free time to farm. Just be honest... you are mad because other people have gear that is just as good as yours,.. and you don't feel superior anymore. qq</div></div><hr />

Because, in those few months, people are actually playing the game.<br />

Just because it will change, doesn't mean there isn't a problem now that can't be fixed.<br />

<br />
Where did you read this?<br />
<br />
<br />
It isn't hard to determine. You take http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50376 and copy the hit and crit, then convert the agility and attack power based on the stat values and you come out with a figure for strength. (or just look at http://www.wowhead.com/?item=51001 and copy the amount of strength) <br />
<br />
For what it's worth, it's probably all still wrong, as an item with socket at ilvl 251 and 4 stats instead of 5 will come out different when passed through the item budget calculator. With no agility, it will likely have more crit on it. <br />
<br />
Doesn't make him wrong either.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also the amount of stamina for a plate wearing ring is too low. See http://www.wowhead.com/?item=51559 for a more likely comparison. The possibility of there being hit on it is still there, but if they are going to itemize the ring for more strength for the plate dps, they might also consider replacing it with ArP or haste as it's a more favorable stat</div></div><hr />

Speaking of bed times and letting the adults talk, it sounds like you didn't get your nap today. You should tuck in early. Customer support does not equal keeping you informed to perfection. A loose timeline is a courtesy. Only the ignorant could so vastly underestimate the complexity of events supporting that timeline and the delay risks. And only the child would stamp their foot and moan about it when things didn't go their way.</div></div><hr />

WTF is that about? This is why release dates should never be &quot;guessed&quot; at. If there are &quot;sources&quot; saying no patch...at least give a reason as to why. Unless said source could give you a reason as to why, then they imo are not credible at all<br />

This is a sarcastic post in response for all those guys saying that CC in BC was fun and hard and required a lot of skill...<br />
<br />
<br />
(witch is false, it take no skill to spam sheep on a target... and CC was only needed if you didn't have a pally tank)<br />
<br />
I also work from 40 hours/week, maybe more, i dont want to farm all the days for potion, oil, flask etc... <br />
<br />
But there is ppl that will say it was more hard during these time etc... and you know for these guys<br />
time consuming = hard and hard = fun. So Time consuming = fun.<br />
<br />
this so a korean ways of thinking when you look at their MMO where you need to farm like hell (not hard only time consuming) to acheive something</div></div><hr />

And normally the patch download happens first thing in the morning and still isnt up for download. So one of two things would have to happen for the season to start. The new season start with no PVP drops from the new VoA boss and no S8 gear to buy from the vendor or the patch download will start really late. <br />

They better seriously make an enormous overhaul on 5man heroics for Cata they have been a complete joke since day one in wrath offering no challenge nor demands in CC, marking, level headed pulling or skill. And every tier they become a faceroll for the previous tiers free gear, free 232 and frosts good job.<br />
<br />
Kind of nice for the patch not to be this week, I mean bad for the pvp'ers ofc because that is your thing and like the pve'ers you need new content to make your playing worthwhile, but VOA boss will be a joke and reward 264 tier which is BS and defeats the objective of killing end wing bosses for tokens to unlock 264.<br />

* The Scourge and the Lich King's last hold, Frostwing Hall will be added to the game. However, in order to enter the wing, the Ashen Verdict must shatter the barrier first.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like it will be added, but not available.<br />
<br />
I've always thought there will be a final barrier between the Frostwing bosses and the lich king.<br />
<br />
This could put an extra ~2 weeks on this instance, before we see the lich king (i.e give us 2 weeks to kill sindra and dreamwalker).<br />
<br />
<br />
My guess is on an event that progresses as people complete daily quests outside of the dungeon, kind of like the phases of dailies everyone went through to unlock stuff on the Isle of quel'danas, but I also think we're looking at 1-2 weeks.</div></div><hr />
