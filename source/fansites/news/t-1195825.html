Welcome Your Friends (Old and New) to Azeroth<br />
Do you have a friend who's interested in getting back into World of Warcraft in time for the upcoming launch of the Mists of Pandaria expansion? Let them know we're providing certain players who've taken a break from adventuring in Azeroth with seven days of free game time to get them back in the fight. One-time WoW players whose subscription ended more than 30 days ago can take advantage of this offer by clicking here (https://us.battle.net/account/management/wow/claim-promotion.html?promoId=SEVEN_DAYS_PROMOTION) (EU here (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/claim-promotion.html)), logging in to their Battle.net account, and claiming their free game time. Time is of the essence, as this offer ends September 19.<br />
<br />
Don’t forget about our Recruit a Friend program, either. If you have friends who haven’t experienced World of Warcraft at all yet, this is a great time to bring them into the fold. For bringing in a new recruit, you can earn an epic flying mount -- the swift and sleek Obsidian Nightwing -- along with 30 days of game time, and your friend will get perks (including bonus XP and bonus levels) designed to make it easier for the two of you to adventure together.

Challenge Mode Difficulty and Nerfs<br />
Seriously blizzard, if CHALLENGE modes are ever nerfed to the point say like the cataclysm heroic dungeons were, what would be the point in calling them CHALLENGE mode runs?<br />
That isn't the intention. Now, there could be times were a particular dungeon has a specific mechanic, pull, or encounter that is more difficult than we intended in all difficulties. In cases like that you may see us make adjustments to the dungeon across the board.<br />
<br />
But, to be clear, our intent isn't to make Challenge Mode dungeons more accessible or easier over time. In part this is also why, as you acquire more powerful gear over the course of the expansion, it will be scaled down in this setting so that the challenge remains roughly equivalent from the start of the expansion to the end. We also don't allow matchmaking for them, as they're intended to be difficult for organized groups.<br />
<br />
I can totally see you guys nerfing a previous set when a new set comes out however. Seems to be par the course. Nerf it when it's not current content.<br />
The Challenge Mode dungeon structure is really closely bound up with the leaderboards we’re going to have. It isn’t really possible to “nerf” the content meaningfully without invalidating those leaderboards. It may be helpful to think of the Gold medal armor sets as analogous to Gladiator mounts. We may have a new “season” of Challenges, with new dungeons to race through, but that doesn’t mean that past seasons’ rewards will suddenly become more attainable.<br />
<br />
Hey if challenge modes are cool and go well, will we get challenge raids like AQ40 and MC??? If so you guys should have challenge mode raid achievements for each raid and dungeon just basically saying you did em cause I think that would be cool and well worth my time to play.<br />
If players really like Challenges and we see a lot of interest in the leaderboards, there's definitely the potential there for extending the system to raid content in some form. We've already seen a lot of interest in raid speed runs -- from our very own BlizzCon Live Raid to other events that fansites have hosted with streamed races between top guilds -- and it’s compelling to us. We'd love to explore formalizing that system!<br />
<br />
Wouldn't it defeat the point of them? Normals for leveling, heroics for that initial gearing for T14 (and they are much easier than Cata's were on launch, I've tested them), and Challenge modes for those who want a challenge. I get it, some people can spend more time on and in WoW than others, but isn't it ok to have something like this for those who want to be challenged?<br />
Not only that, a good, organized Challenge Mode group will likely find farming Valor in Challenge dungeons to be more efficient. They're not set on a lockout like Heroic dungeons are, and the bosses reward more Valor than on Heroic, plus there's a daily quest to complete a specific Challenge Mode dungeon each day for a Valor bonus.<br />
<br />
Conversely, a player who doesn't readily have four friends online at regular intervals will probably find running Heroic Dungeon Finder to be more efficient for obtaining Valor. Challenge dungeons are at least on par with the most difficult Burning Crusade Heroics, and death will still cost ya.<br />
<br />
Now, in this thread I've been sharing a lot of information I've learned from Ion Hazzikostas, an awesome man, so I just want to throw in my own copper (psst, I have more than two!). <br />
<br />
I've never been more impressed with a World of Warcraft endgame design model than I am with Mists. I think the way various prestige, vanity, fun, diverse, and power-increasing progression systems are designed shows such a commitment to the creation of gameplay with broad appeal, while preserving the philosophy that prestige can be earned through a combination of effort and exceptional performance.<br />
<br />
Did I just go full fanboy on our devs? I'm sorry. <br />
<br />
You never go full fanboy. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/235573-are-challenge-modes-going-to-be-nerfed-at-all/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6551925497?page=8#143))<br />
<br />
No Nerfs For Challenge Modes<br />
If at all feasible, we're not going to be adjusting the content itself. Persistent leaderboards are the backbone of the system, and if we make the dungeon easier, then your 14:13 time last week might actually be more impressive than my 14:05 clear today, but there would be no way of knowing that. It's conceivable that we might adjust the actual Gold/Silver/Bronze cutoff times slightly if it turns out we were badly off the mark with the tuning, but we're pretty confident in our numbers.<br />
<br />
As far as composition goes, I can't promise that every possible composition will be able to get Gold. (Apologies in advance to the prospective monk/monk/monk/monk/monk groups out there.) Every composition will be able to get Silver (subject to some fairly basic ground rules such as &quot;you have a healer&quot;), and every class should have multiple viable group makeups in which it can obtain Gold, assuming masterful play.<br />
<br />
Can I do Temple of the Jade Serpent as many times as I want in challange mode per day? Or does it have a lock system?<br />
You can run the same challenge mode dungeon as many times per day as you like.<br />
<br />
It'll be a bit before we hear an answer on that one, as I suspect Watcher reacted to it with a &quot;hmm, good question&quot;. I'm sure a dev somewhere has at least considered the question, but they might not have settled on their final answer yet.<br />
We like the gameplay of adjusting talents to suit the situation. We don't like the gameplay of cycling through power cooldown talents to effectively benefit from an entire tier of choices simultaneously. Our plan is to allow the former while disallowing the latter.<br />
<br />
Does this mean you have a workaround for the dreaded &quot;You have entered too many instances recently&quot; or will this be popping up during challenge modes?<br />
<br />
I am specifically thinking of running in engaging boss 1, failing somehow and resetting. Rinse and repeat that 5x on the current system (Assuming reseting a challenge mode works like resetting a normal instance) and you'll be locked out for an hour minus however long it took you to wipe those 5x.<br />
Challenge modes have a special reset system. The party leader can instantly reset a challenge run from inside the instance via a menu dropdown from his or her unitframe. The group gets ported back to the entrance, and everything in the instance reverts to its original state. There's no limit on how often you can do that. You may still want to finish a somewhat botched run though, if you aren't capped on Valor for the week, since each completed run will award Valor.<br />
<br />
What's the word on profession items and weird items such as Nifty Stopwatch, Potions of Speed, Swift Boots, Rocket Boots, netherweave nets, flasks, food and other &quot;creative items&quot;<br />
There are no restrictions on items or consumables. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/235584-no-nerfs-for-challenge-modes/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6551925381?page=2#22))<br />

Just wondering GC, have you found out why stealth level was reduced yet?<br />
No, we're not sure how it happened, but it was indeed lowered so we raised it back up for rogue and Feral druids, restoring the same effectiveness they had in 4.3.<br />

How is this not counter your often-stated goal of increasing the clarity of game mechanics to new players? I know I'd be confused if my DS magically hit harder when I switched specs, just like I was when CS magically changed its cooldown when I first specced my paladin Prot last expansion.<br />
I sympathize with what you're saying, but it takes a fairly sophisticated player (and certainly not a new one) to notice that Death Strike is or is not doing 308% weapon damage + 2079. Put another way, the tooltips have never been as remotely accurate as they are in 5.0. In previous expansions they often out and out lied because the damage was affected by so many considerations that the tooltips weren't sophisticated enough to catch. Spell tooltips are pretty smart now, smarter than ever anyway, but they still have limitations. We try to get them as accurate as possible, but there are plenty of situations when that is not the case.<br />
<br />
It's hitting for 280% in blood. The tooltip is just wrong, they forgot to reduce it to 200% in the tooltip before adding the 1.4x modifier for blood. They just added the 1.4x modifier, and left it the same according to the tooltip. It still doing 280% + whatever.<br />
<br />
This is likely the case. We have to manually build tooltips a lot these days and the tooltip may not have been updated, but the damage was.

PvP Power and Resilience Effects on Gear Strength<br />
PvP power and resilience is an undeniably great stat for PvP and you will definately be wanting more of it. If you would like to know more about how PvP power/resilience works in MoP, Vanguards guide is a great read, although very long and complex. You can find it here: http://www.arenajunkies.com/news/525-mists-pvp-power-and-resilience-guide/<br />
<br />
i wouldn't worry, for pvp, pvp gear is now the best gear you can wear, if you wear pve gear you'll do less damage and take far more This is very true. In the above guide if you check some of the graphs, you will see the large disparity between the damage done with and without the PvP stats.<br />
<br />
Pvp power and pvp defense doesnt work on like outside of sw while you duel other people??<br />
Whenever you are attacking another player, PvP power will boost your damage done. Whereas PvP power only increases your healing done if you are not in a dungeon or raid. So in duels and world PvP, PvP gear will be better (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/235531-mop-pvp-gear-is-weaker-than-pve-gear/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5299231191?page=1#8))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ssjgohan4life</div><div class="date">2012-09-13, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the most part I agreed with the video, somethings were a bit off like when he was saying Temporal Shield was the best but then he clarified it was only good if you weren't going to die from the dmg, which is the whole point of a shield, to keep you from dying, not to heal you after you took the damage. My only major problem is his assessment of frost, he must not be very experienced with it to think it's the lowest, that said he is also on the beta, THAT said he does more dmg as frost in this video than the other two specs, so I dont know what he thinks he's talking about lol. As a frost mage whose topped the charts and ranked top 1-100 on many fights before this patch and now do even MORE dps, I say its very viable. Glyph that makes your pet do more damage, brain freeze procs is a guaranteed crit, ice lance is a guaranteed crit (when used with FoF) and all this dmg is increased by our mastery, so basically if you are at the shatter crit cap you are critting with just about everything doing double damage.</div></div><hr />

I do too have been in the beta and the zones are awesome especially Kun Lai Summit the who zone reminds me so much of Storm Peaks in terms of scale the mountains are huge. And Valley of The Four Winds reminds me a lot of Nagrand with wide open grassy areas with massive rocks jutting out of the ground here and there. And a couple of recognizable characters have set up a camp there too. :)<br />
<br />
But in all MoP is shaping up to be a good expac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they keep talking about challenges and the leaderboards and whatnot but no one has yet asked what will happen with every new patch (5.1 , 5.2, etc) considering blizzard loves to make huge changes to every class every major patch.<br />
im also sure a few months from now lederboards will be full with groups that stack fotm classes especially DPS ones<br />
<br />
So you mean like.. all world firsts/high rated arena/BG teams, etc?<br />
<br />
It's a competition. Blizzard even said that some compositions will be a lot better than others, but that all classes will have a combo that'll be able to reach gold.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't hold my breath waiting on that fix since it is specific to a DK trying to farm old content for a mount. If your gear is decent, just do it as Frost. Here's a thread describing how: us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6490009084 (sorry not allowed to post links yet)</div></div><hr />

Like how we trusted them that heroics would be &quot;heroic&quot; again? Ye, didn't take long until there were nerfs.<br />

Wish the challenge mode was really hard though. Like getting Gold would be insanely hard and stuff</div></div><hr />

What I think it means is that if you hit Templar's Verdict it can no longer proc another Divine Purpose after 1 so you can't just chain TV anymore. Basically no more strings of 2-5 TV's since DP can only proc once.</div></div><hr />

That is exactly the premise of Challenge Mode and tye experience of [seasoned, veteran] internal testers. I believe the terms &quot;pulling my hair out&quot; were quoted in a recent Blues conversation on the difficulty of Gold -relative to anything before it. <br />
<br />
TL:DR Gold should be the hardest challenge in the history of Wow; in their words. <br />
<br />
Bring it on!</div></div><hr />

I think it's worthwhile putting it on the front page just to give exposure to someone making an effort to share information (just, you wouldn't post a link EVERY time this person made a video). At the same time, I agree the video isn't an authoritative source on all things mage. Personally I prefer a textual write-up when it comes to this sort of information that I can consume in much less time than 30 minutes, but I did recommend it to a more casual friend of mine that prefers videos.</div></div><hr />

I suppose that is a valid argument. I might just be too informed to not nitpick the video :[</div></div><hr />

Further, they offer gear that is high end raid quality, whereas Blizz chose to award Tmogs and more Valor points. I thought it funny they gave a shout out to a dev for copying another game's design and just improving on it. Maybe proof the other devs look at other games while the higher ups don't? Wish I worked for a company like that... &quot;Boss, here's an idea I've been kicking around. (insert another company's marketing strategy here)&quot;. &quot;Brilliant!

<br />
What do you propose instead? Every game be completely independent and unique? Don't be silly. Yes it *is* good business's and design to take a trending idea and refine, capitalise on it. Also you (and I, et al) do not know how long the Challenge Mode system design had been under development.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc5eb8aebd26</div><div class="date">2012-09-14, 07:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All due respect, but that 'seasoned' mage from the guide isn't all that informed.<br />
He is assuming some things that are just not true, which effectively lowers the DPS of all viewers 'because that guy on YouTube must be right why would I try finding out stuff myself'<br />
Icy Veins made the same mistake, but that is corrected now.<br />
<br />
The point that bothered me the most was the Living Bomb part, he assumes that you must let it run out for the explosion to trigger, which is true... if you still play in Cata...<br />
In MoP you can refresh it right before the last tick, and still let the explosion go off, making the rotation way more forgiving and providing a dps boost for every player that is not a simulator (perfect).<br />
<br />
Here is how it works now (tested and confirmed):<br />
LB ticks 5 times for me + one explosion on the last tick<br />
If I refresh it after the explosion I get a total of 10 ticks +2 explosions<br />
If I refresh it right after the 4th tick it triggers the explosion and I get a total of 10 ticks + 2 explosions.<br />
If I refresh it right after the 3th tick it doesn't trigger the explosion and I get a total of 9 ticks + 1 explosion</div></div><hr />

If you play arcane properly you can top above both other specs at lvl 85 in DS, without the lvl 90 talents.<br />
Also he has no clue how to play a frost mage.</div></div><hr />
