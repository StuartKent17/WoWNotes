<br />
I realize that, but even with it sticking out it doesn't look right. The direction of the stairs has nothing to do with how far it sticks out. They are going too much to the right , should be angled more to the left. That being said, the whole platform looks too far off center from where it should be for how much it sticks out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mind Shock: Detonate all targets afflicted by your Shadow Word: Pain, dealing 65% of remaining damage immediately. 10 second cooldown<br />
This so that:<br />
&quot;Mind Blast, Mind Spike and Mind Flay deal 45% extra damage when Shadow Word: Pain is present on only one target.&quot;<br />
Could work when needing to switch target and not be penalized in single target.<br />
There, done. Multi-dotting not improved but single target buffed by about 25%, and more interesting than merely buffing Blast and Flay and nerfing VT/SWP</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree. I like it overall though. I like the buff look. They really need to work on the butt though. It's a big flat for the rest of the model and seems noticeably so in game. All of the males need a slight adjustment. The &quot;junk&quot; needs a bump out slightly too. They're a bit too neutered in a manner.</div></div><hr />

Awesome that they added that into the game. And I am curious if that is the original player of for Leroy Jenkins or not. Sounds a lot like him. And knowing that he is a follower you can get. Just really, really hate that UBRS for level 60 or so range is being completely removed from the game (went and checked it out on live. Old instance portal doesn't work, but there is now a level 55 or so LBRS, and UBRS is level 100). I wonder if this means that the recipe for Arcanite Reaper will no longer be attainable. Which would suck so much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not JUST you but it's definitely not a shared opinion or even particularly valid. <br />
<br />
You might not like the way things are going but you should still be able to objectively look at the artwork and understand that it is not &quot;bad&quot; That dark portal graphic (especially the video) is high resolution, has excellent detail and coloring, and a distinct animation that is different than we've seen before.</div></div><hr />

I believe you meant Plans: Arcanite Champion (http://www.wowdb.com/items/12834-plans-arcanite-champion). Blizzard has stated in the past that it basically doesn't care much for old recipes, so if their source is removed... Yeah. Better farm it while you can.</div></div><hr />

They have awkward animation in modelviewer that looks alot more disturbing than the original model. I also don't like how they seem to be craning their necks out like some sort of chicken. Their animation makes them look super fidgety and high-strung to me as well. Perhaps it will look better with time, but from what i've seen of the other models, the skeleton is mostly (if not all the way) complete which worries me about my Night Elf druid main. Guess i'll be using the old model then.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Login screen looks great. Idk why people are complaining, it's tradition, it's nostalgic (Even the music is homage to every expansion before it!), and the DP plays a MASSIVE role in this expansion. It's how Garrosh was able to travel back in time, it's how he brought the Iron horde to our world, the first questline we do will be in a suicide mission to shut it down for crying out loud. It was even the final scene in the cinematic. Showing some orcs in an army standing around would just be a hot mess of NPCs sitting in the idle animation, which would more than likely cause lag for players on older computers. Besides, that shit is too complicated for a simple login screen. The whole thing is meant to get people hyped. It says we're going back to classic Warcraft. It's not reused, it's brand new. The only thing reused is the fact that it's the dark portal we all know about...It's like saying Draenor is &quot;reused&quot; because it's supposed to be an old version of Outland. No, it's built from scratch with brand new visuals and everything.Having just the dark portal is inviting and mysterious, and if you replaced that with some random city or landscape it wouldn't define the expansion like the DP does. Dark portal is the first thing you see when logging in, and when going to Draenor.<br />
<br />
Anyways, that space goat looks so dang cute! But it's also kind of creepy though because it's body parts and features are that of the Draenei - a sentient race of people. That's like seeing a flesh colored dog with human legs, eyes, ears, and mouth.</div></div><hr />

Are people really complaining about nerfs to abilities in a beta build of an expansion that hasn't even been theory-crafted, has had tiny amounts of raid testing and is only just starting to have number/balancing passes?<br />
<br />
Do people really, after 10 years of this game, still not understand that in a new expansion everything resets and you have no real clue how powerful or underpowered an ability was at level 100 just because you've used it in live at level 90?<br />
<br />
Do people really, after 10 years of this game, still not get that things are about to fluxuate wildly over the coming weeks and months towards release as testing goes on?<br />
<br />
I sometimes think that Blizzard should just go back to NDAs on everything, not telling players anything about what they're doing until they finish it and abandon all social media and forum posting. No matter what they say people always seem to put in the extra effort to be really stupid about it.</div></div><hr />

In general, you're definitely right. But, that particular hair-moustache combo looks strikingly like Vinny to me!</div></div><hr />

Almost every new character model looks terrible. Some actually worse than the old ones *cough*human male*cough*</div></div><hr />

I was hoping we'd see completely different models that had the same overall feel of the old ones. <br />

Of course I understand that their biggest concern was alienating players who liked the way their character looked and didn't want any changes.<br />
