Upcoming Changes to the NA WoW MVP Program<br />
Hey guys!<br />
<br />
Over the past year we've had it on our plate to breathe a bit of life in the MVP program for World of Warcraft (you may have seen me mention it here and there, and I know the MVPs have been eagerly waiting for movement on this). After nearly a year of discussions, we're finally ready to start moving forward with a refresh of the MVP program for World of Warcraft!<br />
<br />
Most of our active posters here know that when the MVP program was founded, it's goal was to recognize active forums poster who contributed to our community through things like high-quality class guides or assisting and guiding new players with helpful information. While being active and posting in a constructive manner will still be something we take into account, we realize that we now live in a world with Icy Veins, Wowhead, Reddit, and numerous other communities that didn't necessarily exist at the onset of this project. This leads our MVP group to not being able to actively fulfill it's original purpose on our singular forums platform.<br />
<br />
All of this led us to think we needed to be realigning the purpose of the program slightly, as we want to more actively empower the group to engage in discussions with us on various community issues, happening on the forums and in our greater community. This would also include working to provide insight into community and gameplay feedback they may see around the community, with direct conversations between the WoW community team and the WoW MVP group as a whole on a regular basis, much as we do in our conversations with folks on Reddit, Discord, etc., something that hasn't been utilized to its best.<br />
<br />
To facilitate this, we will be moving the WoW MVP program to an application-based recruitment system, which will address a few concerns we have currently with the recruitment process, as well as letting us asked targeted questions to candidates during certain recruitment periods, and hopefully widening the audience. We expect to open recruitment early next week, after the President’s Day holiday, so be on the lookout for a thread if you're interested!<br />
<br />
Of note, these changes DO NOT affect any region or franchise outside of World of Warcraft in North America, and these changes also do not apply to our awesome Customer and Technical Support MVPs who do great things.<br />
<br />
We look forward to getting to work on the program and hearing your feedback!<br />
<br />
I hope this doesn't mean Crepe is losing his MVP status. I notice community MVPs are not listed as being spared these changes.<br />
We're asking the MVPs to reapply for the process, but we will be keeping everyone who is able to meet the newer standards going forward! <br />
<br />
I wouldn't expect any of the familiar faces you know to go away unless it's their own choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat Log Tool - Wipefest<br />
Wipefest (https://www.wipefest.net) is a web tool that uses data from Warcraft Logs (https://www.warcraftlogs.com/) to display insights and timelines for raid encounters.<br />
<br />
Insights aim to answer common questions that you might have about each pull, such as &quot;Who is soaking Annihilations on Garothi Worldbreaker (https://www.wipefest.net/report/7HFRByQ6hYNA9wmc/fight/5?insights=2076-6)?&quot;, or &quot;What pod rotation did we use on Antoran High Command (https://www.wipefest.net/report/yxW1hraPm9NfgcDR/fight/13?insights=2070-3)?&quot;.<br />
<br />
The timeline aims to provide a concise overview of the important events within a fight, such as major boss abilities, big cooldowns, and deaths. Timelines can be filtered easily, letting you quickly dig into certain mechanics, such as Fusillades, Fel Shields, and healing cooldowns (https://www.wipefest.net/report/7HFRByQ6hYNA9wmc/fight/12?filters=R-MH09,2070-0F04), or if people used defensive cooldowns before they died (https://www.wipefest.net/report/vkmJtn6pzA4WV1bC/fight/17?filters=R-0506PD0D).<br />
<br />
You can also select players to focus in on them (https://www.wipefest.net/report/cJtAzp6k8G2fTCNm/fight/15?filters=R-0HCR02AP0I0EMHMT0D,F-HEPPTMHS,H-AMLPGHFMVFRVRATK,PRHO-DHDPLFGSS1S2LC,2064-0ECW0GFBTPFDHS0NCIUPFO0bPE&amp;focuses=140,35), giving you more information about the fight from their perspective. This feature still needs contributors to enable more specializations (you can find out more at the GitHub repository (https://github.com/JoshYaxley/Wipefest.EventConfigs/).<br />
<br />
There's also a Discord server (https://discord.gg/QhE4hfS) for any questions and suggestions!<br />

Warcraft III Event<br />
Two different Warcraft III streamers have been invited (https://vk.com/yesitshappy?w=wall-97914992_12591) to an event at Blizzard that will take place at the end of this month. They haven't shared any details about whatever may be announced. <br />
<br />
There was a job posting for an unannounced MMO RTS project that required mobile experience earlier this year.<br />

Venruki and Ziqo’s European Cup #1 MVP<br />
<br />
MVP: Wallirik – XRB to the moon<br />
<br />
During the European Qualifier Cup #1, Wallirik rose to the top of the heap as Ziqo and Venruki’s choice for MVP. As a part of a Warlock, Shaman, Druid team, Wallirik landed crucial spell locks and fears throughout the tournament to keep Zeepeye alive. According to Ziqo, not only was he solid defensively, he was also able to “180 situations” and generate “instant kills” using combinations with his Thalkiels consumption. This combination of offensive and defensive plays put him as both analysts choice for MvP.<br />
<br />
Honorable Mention: Tsx – Ascendant formerly known as Rockets Esports<br />
<br />
Tsx caught us all off guard in Europe Cup #1. Having joined Rockets Esports just 1 hour before sign-ups closed, he immediately displayed his individual prowess landing impossible Polymorphs against defending World Champions ABC, leading to their elimination from the tournament. His aggressive playstyle became an instant hit with the analysts, fitting perfectly with Ratapai’s play style.<br />

Snow Fight - A WarCraft Tale<br />
During these cold winter months, we’ve got a children’s book for you that’s sure to warm even the Lich King’s icy heart. Snow Fight: A Warcraft Tale is an exciting adventure featuring little Arthas, Thrall, and Varian, who give bullying the cold shoulder and learn that games are better with fair play.<br />
<br />
Written by Chris Metzen and illustrated by Wei Wang, the book was created with the idea of finding fun ways to share some of the Warcraft universe’s characters and ideas with kids. As Metzen says, telling lighter stories about our favorite heroes and villains seemed like a perfect way to share our passion for Warcraft with the young, imaginative minds we love most!<br />

I wouldn't mind a good mobile Warcraft game, providing feels like Warcraft. Hearthstone does too much of its own thing, it doesn't satisfy my desire for more Warcraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they are making an MMORTS for mobile, it probably won't be a port of Warcraft III, though. Honestly I'm not even sure what &quot;MMORTS&quot; means, I just hope it's something with real, meaningful gameplay, not a clicker/builder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Honesty, it doesn't sound all that ridiculous to me. With all the volatility that has existed in recent months, it would not surprise me at all to see Blizzard reeling things in a bit. If not to appear to be more concerned with their community, then at least to help make their standing with the community appear more unified in the future. Let's be honest, the outrage over the most recent unpopular changes were unprecedented. Some of you will say that it was just another day on the forums, but it really was the largest backlash in World of Warcraft's history. When your MVP's are the ones taking an active role in the outrage, it just makes all of the impressionable players who are looking to others for guidance - all the more likely to join in the outrage. Even if that outrage is justified, it still leads to a lot of unnecessary hysteria. This has the effect of making the players who aren't even going to be swayed by unpopular changes, into joining in on the craze, and contributing to the discussions in an extremely counterproductive way.<br />
<br />
I have to say that I am really impressed with how smart their PR is becoming. The way that the Allied Races completely drowned out the recent opposition and outrage - was absolutely masterful. * Release overwhelmingly unpopular changes ----&gt; Release overwhelming popular additions = Profit from the players celebrating, and benefit from the opposition being drowned out. I'm not suggesting that the Allied Races were released just to silence people, only that Blizzard has become extremely skilled in their PR. Many people struck out on the forums - not because they wanted to start some sh*t, but because they feel like they are seeing their last hope to influence the development and direction of the game. Seriously... when I saw the Allied Races announcement, I immediately thought of how brilliantly well that Blizzard had played their hand. It surely must have the effect of discouraging people from engaging in the kinds of discussions if good PR can very effectively snuff them out. <br />
<br />
This isn't the makings of a shady company, I'm not saying that in any way. These are simply the makings of a company that is learning how to manage their PR in the best way possible. I don't blame them for that even for a moment, it's a natural progression in business to minimize opposition and negativity. That doesn't mean people have to like it, nor does it mean that it's a good thing for the consumers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They only had to make it work for a single race, and couldn't even do that.<br />
<br />
Tbh, all belts that got something handing... clips through my nightelf. Quite annoying. Makes those belts useless for mogs, even tho they are usually the best looking ones.</div></div><hr />

Probably because they don't consider them broken.</div></div><hr />

Not saying the people who gets it doesn't deserve it, but an MVP posting in a thread almost always derails the conversation because people consider the green text to be officially Blizzard sanctioned, and thus true. Often these posts are just personal opinions, and an MVP's analysis on a subject have sometimes proven to be flat out wrong. No one is perfect, but that is the problem of the MVP system. Blizzard giving some posters more validity in an open debate, where most of the arguments put forward are based in subjective experience. That is just an invitation to create a toxic enviroment. <br />
<br />
Believe me, if you disagree with an MVP, no matter how polite you are, people (not nessecarily the MVP) will give you shit for it, because you're either being a fanboy of Blizzard or a coorporate mouthpiece (as was the case under WoD) if you dare actually liking whatever people are ranting about on the official forums this week.</div></div><hr />

They're probably hoping not enough people will notice and/or forget about it, as they did with the Nightborne faces.</div></div><hr />

Why not? Clash of Clans and the newcomer Clash Royale are the two most succesful mobile games of all times.<br />

If Blizzard does a good job I'm looking forward to a game like this in Blizz Style.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh you know they will. blizzards entire &quot;business strategy&quot; since they started was 'identify popular product that people enjoy, make our own version of the same thing but better'. <br />
<br />
i'd imagine they will identify what people hate the most of that type of game and eliminate those frustrations, similar to how they got rid of items for their moba or how they got rid of wanting to level in WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I havent finished my Voidie grind yet. But from what I've read, it is a transmog set that is race-locked to the associated race. So theoretically, yes, you can just xmog the shoulders onto another outfit of any character who is of that race, once the armor is unlocked.<br />
<br />
If someone can confirm/refute, that would be great.</div></div><hr />

This was a set specifically for Nightborne though. The fact that they didn't make a belt that didn't clip is stunningly incompetent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, good eye! That's how the original Draenei female looked back in the TBC alpha...for about a week. And then someone said something about furries and they chopped their tails off and removed the animations completely. Quite a lot of us screamed bloody murder about it, but just like derpfaced chihuahua worgen females, the &quot;furry panic&quot; always results in an uglification of something that looked pretty cool. And likewise, Blizzard jamming their fingers in their ears and saying &quot;nope, we can't hear you! we're not making something that a furry might like! we universally will destroy our own product in order to make a TINY group of people less likely to play our game!&quot; (and honestly, ruining the aesthetic of various races DOESN'T STOP FURRIES FROM PLAYING, so I really don't get their freaking point. Just go to Goldshire. They're there. Blizz didn't stop SHIT.)<br />
<br />
AAAAANYWAYS, If you look at the original art for Draenei, you'll see the females did have long whip-like tails. I personally really loved the way they looked!<br />
<br />
And no. I'm NOT a furry. I'm just tired of Blizzard's rampant hatred of a group ruining really cool-looking races.<br />
<br />
Also, in b4 Vulpera-nerf. They're cute, and Blizz will destroy them because OMG FURRIES.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Armakus</div><div class="date">2018-02-18, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honesty, it doesn't sound all that ridiculous to me. With all the volatility that has existed in recent months, it would not surprise me at all to see Blizzard reeling things in a bit. If not to appear to be more concerned with their community, then at least to help make their standing with the community appear more unified in the future. Let's be honest, the outrage over the most recent unpopular changes were unprecedented. Some of you will say that it was just another day on the forums, but it really was the largest backlash in World of Warcraft's history. When your MVP's are the ones taking an active role in the outrage, it just makes all of the impressionable players who are looking to others for guidance - all the more likely to join in the outrage. Even if that outrage is justified, it still leads to a lot of unnecessary hysteria. This has the effect of making the players who aren't even going to be swayed by unpopular changes, into joining in on the craze, and contributing to the discussions in an extremely counterproductive way.<br />
<br />
I have to say that I am really impressed with how smart their PR is becoming. The way that the Allied Races completely drowned out the recent opposition and outrage - was absolutely masterful. * Release overwhelmingly unpopular changes ----&gt; Release overwhelming popular additions = Profit from the players celebrating, and benefit from the opposition being drowned out. I'm not suggesting that the Allied Races were released just to silence people, only that Blizzard has become extremely skilled in their PR. Many people struck out on the forums - not because they wanted to start some sh*t, but because they feel like they are seeing their last hope to influence the development and direction of the game. Seriously... when I saw the Allied Races announcement, I immediately thought of how brilliantly well that Blizzard had played their hand. It surely must have the effect of discouraging people from engaging in the kinds of discussions if good PR can very effectively snuff them out. <br />
<br />
This isn't the makings of a shady company, I'm not saying that in any way. These are simply the makings of a company that is learning how to manage their PR in the best way possible. I don't blame them for that even for a moment, it's a natural progression in business to minimize opposition and negativity. That doesn't mean people have to like it, nor does it mean that it's a good thing for the consumers.<br />
<br />
I'm terribly confused, what did I miss on the forums? What were people complaining about?</div></div><hr />

Nightborne female faces are still broke besides one as well and it's the same thing for Lightforged females.</div></div><hr />
