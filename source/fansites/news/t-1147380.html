Siege of Niuzao Temple<br />
Niuzao Temple extends across two fortified islands far beyond a towering wall called the Serpent's Spine. For years, tenacious pandaren defenders have protected the narrow bridges connecting the isles, staving off any would-be invaders. Yet recently, the mantid created their own bridge--a massive tree root--and seized one of the islands by surprise. Now, these brutal insectoids are poised to assault Niuzao's remaining guardians.<br />

Rogue Class Design<br />
Ghostcrawler, I know you probably won't make your way this deep in the thread, but I just wanted to say thanks for all of this great information and feedback. I really appreciate the openness you've shared with us in these posts. Kudos.<br />
We read everything. We just can't always respond to it all. But if you make good points, I promise we will consider them. <br />
<br />
GC, I’d say thanks for the posts you’ve made, but they confuse me. Not the content of the posts, but that you take the trouble to post them yet the content of them is generally dismissive.<br />
I understand your point of view and I sympathize, but it is something of a no win scenario for us. If we agreed with any particular feedback and there weren't compelling reasons to not make a change, then we would do it. Everyone is happy. That happens sometimes. More often, we disagree or we agree but there is some other reason we aren't going to make a change. The way this comes across to players more often than not is that ideas were suggested and ignored or dismissed. They are never ignored or dismissed.<br />
<br />
It would be great if it was possible for us to debate those issues every time they come up, but I don't know a reasonable way to do that. Sometimes I find a bit of spare time to make a forum post or a blog to try and explain our design intent so that at least you have some frame of reference, and the other developers and the community team do likewise.<br />
<br />
As I said in one these recent posts, it often feels like the only kind of post from us that is going to be acceptable to some players is &quot;Yes! You are spot on! Buffs and / or changes incoming!&quot; But imagine what the game would be like if we did that every time a suggestion came up. Yes, we should only make the good changes and not the bad ones, but we have yet to find a litmus test to easily detect good from bad. (Let us know if you know of one!) Instead we use our judgment, which is a mix of gut instinct, experience and feedback.<br />
<br />
Realize that some of the time we choose to post nothing at all it's because we want to avoid the &quot;But you just dismissed all of our concerns&quot; responses. It's a bummer for players to read a post that says &quot;We disagree&quot; or even worse, &quot;we agree but we have a good reason not to make the change.&quot; I get that.

No, because I hold higher regard for the SNES title as well as most every other of that era.<br />

Blizzard? Bad at making music? Word of Warcraft has some of the best video game music out there, bar none. The Northrend transport theme (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dumZn8MrX6M)? Storm Peaks (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38TA-X0dXr4&amp;feature=related)? Ulduar (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2-CabYoAUk)? Grizzly Hills (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpyInx0ldfo)? Karazhan (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TO97aU-hYM)? Arthas, my son (www.youtube.com/watch?v=86f_U_q4SFg)? Easily some of the most beautiful, and, importantly, fitting, pieces of video game music out there. As for the pet battle music, they seem to have accomplished exactly what style they were shooting for, which is that of the &quot;1990's RPG game.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering that the music, note for note, came from &quot;Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness,&quot; Blizzard can't emulate something that hadn't existed yet. Warcraft II was released 12/09/95, while Pokemon first came out 02/27/96.<br />

Easy to do when the music was originally composed in MIDI format in the '90's. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to sound like too much of a white knight or anything, but;<br />
For all those badmouthing Pico, I think you're a little out of touch. A lot of people don't really care what style or such a video is done in, who it is that's doing them, or otherwise, but more care if they can personify with the person transmitting that information, when it comes to hosts for these types of things anyhow. That's why people like The MMO Report. He isn't some hunky guy, he's a genuine geek but with charisma and a sense of humour, something a lot of gamers wish to be/friends with. Pico probably represents the same thing for females while still being attractive to a large chunk of the male audience.<br />
<br />
I think she's fine and does a great job. Sure she isn't a trained media guru, her voice isn't exactly the most clear, but I understand her fine. That said, everyone starts somewhere. Half of idols/celebs out there were fucking horrible when they started but were trained and got experience in small time stuff they most likely enjoyed before they were offered any big TV/Movie deals (not that i'm suggesting that's what Pico is aiming for or is suited for).<br />
<br />
Anyway, these reports are mainly for the people who don't sit on the internet all day competing over bullshit and complaining about every last little thing, because they, and you, likely already knew all the information that she talked about. But instead of doing something else with your time, you come on here and decide to slander someone for fuck all reason.</div></div><hr />

Wait, am I reading this right? There's an entire 3 boss raid only in heroic mode? That'd be awesome. For me, as a heroic raider. But if 4 of the 14 bosses Blizz promised are heroic only, there'd be some (fairly legitimate) QQ.<br />

You may see it as a cop-out, but I think Blizzard made a good move here. Not only did the WC2 music mean less time and resources spent (since it's only slightly modified), but it really is a good fit for the pet battle feature in terms of pace, tone, and - yes - nostalgia.</div></div><hr />
