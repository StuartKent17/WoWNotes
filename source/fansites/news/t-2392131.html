Our favorite flannel shirt developer (https://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Ben_Brode) is leaving the Hearthstone team and Blizzard.<br />
To my friends, coworkers, and the Hearthstone community,<br />
<br />
After 15 years at Blizzard and almost 10 years working on Hearthstone, I have made the incredibly difficult decision to embark on a new journey.<br />
<br />
Man, that was a hard sentence to type.<br />
<br />
I was 20 years old when I started here. My first role was ‘Night Crew Game Tester.’<br />
<br />
Since then, Blizzard has been good to me. I got to cast esports events, announce BlizzCons, play in Rock Bands, write raps, and work with incredible people. But the biggest opportunity came in 2008 when I joined “Team 5.” The Hearthstone Team.<br />
<br />
I am very proud of Hearthstone. I think we made an impact on the industry. People tell me that Hearthstone brought their family closer together, or that they became close friends with people they met at a Fireside Gathering. Others tell me they were inspired by Hearthstone to become game developers themselves. It’s incredible to be a part of something that touches so many people.<br />
<br />
But as proud as I am of Hearthstone, I am even more proud of the team.<br />
<br />
There is no team like the Hearthstone team. People have come and gone over the 10 years Hearthstone has been in development, but there’s something special about the Soul of the Team. We knew our most important product wasn’t the game, but the team itself. A great team can do great things, and I think the Hearthstone team is the greatest. It isn’t just a job. It’s a shared passion. We get to come to work and focus on the game we love and try to make it better every day.<br />
<br />
We frequently check the Hearthstone subreddit looking for opportunities to improve the game. I have loved the silly memes, engaging in spirited debates, or even just being held accountable to our shared high standards for the game. We try to be highly available on social media, and I think our team helped push the envelope in this regard. It has been especially satisfying to me to see the team step up over the last few years and help engage in these ways as I became more focused on direction and less on actual design.<br />
<br />
I get too much credit by virtue of being a public face, but the 80+ people on the development team are still there, and they are the ones actually making the cards, brawls, events, missions, and features. I am confident the game is in the best possible hands, and I’m excited to see where a new generation of leaders takes Hearthstone from here.<br />
<br />
I am very fortunate to be able to take a crazy risk right now in my life, and I’m excited to be scrappy and a little scared. I’m going to help start a new company. We’ll probably make games, but we haven’t figured anything else out, yet. I’m looking forward to designing, programming, and actually creating things again. I’m going to miss the on-campus Starbucks, though. Dang.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, thank you for taking a chance on me, and thank you for taking a chance on Hearthstone. I can’t wait to see what you do next.<br />
<br />
And to the passionate community of players – I will miss you, and the laughs we shared together. Thank you for making being a part of Hearthstone so much fun for me. I’ve loved every minute.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Ben Brode</div></div><hr />

This still happens. People who aren't fit for positions / don't put in the actual time and energy to get hired get hired ALL the time. You just need to know the right people. Ben Brode was a pizza delivery guy and he got hired because a friend of his worked for the company and called him up specifically to deliver and the people in charge liked him and gave him a job.<br />
<br />
It's not what you know, but who you know, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was an ok fellow imo. I mean 15 years at Blizzard so not surprised he was thinking about moving on after such a long time with them.</div></div><hr />

If you saw some of the recent interviews, you know that there are pretty much 3 expansions in a row already completed, so yeah, i guess it's pretty boring, stagnant and slow, since making cards is so easy compared to other games.</div></div><hr />

This is what worries me the most. That one day we'll see a slightly updated version of this, with a few more bodies in the pit; Blizz counted among them.<br />

Very sad to see him leave, but I hope he finds some new excitement with other projects. Looking forward to seeing what he does.<br />
<br />
Working on the same thing like this for a decade can get very stale for people like him. He was on the small team that started Hearthstone and probably preferred that to being mainly the figurehead of the game. He didn't make a big decision like this overnight, so it's good that he's getting a fresh adventure. He's got the nads to say farewell- I can respect that.</div></div><hr />

Considering he's starting an own company, only to do the same stuff he's doing now... You can see where this is going.<br />
I'll miss him alot. Even if he was 100% fake, he was super entertaining and a hell of a voice actor.</div></div><hr />

However on game design, i dislike the direction Hearthstone has taken.<br />
<br />
First off, the obvious one: RNG.<br />
<br />
Since the second (Goblins vs. Gnomes) i felt that there was too much RNG going, RNG has always been a part of Hearthstone but during the &quot;Vanilla&quot; era i felt that you could at least steer RNG in your favour, cards like Brawl or Mad Bomber reflect that, you can't expect a good outcome but you can manipulate the board in your favour to increase your odds.<br />
<br />
Next, card generation and (near) infinite value, if you played against a freeze mage in earlier days, you knew how much burn that Mage had, so you planned around 2xFrost Nova's, 2x Blizzard and so forth, however since a while ago there has been so much random card generation that a control mage suddenly had 3 or more Ice blocks, Blizzards and so forth, that's not cool to play against.<br />
<br />
Control Warrior used to be a &quot;value deck&quot; because of cards like Cairne, now these cards pale in comparison to the Death Knights cards and various other spells and minions that generate tons of value out of nothing.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the time it takes to nerf powerful cards &amp; decks, a balance patch every three months is simply not enough, the Meta in the last few years has gotten very stale after the first month or so, people were ready for shake ups, those however usually happen only if some decks are really out of control (which takes again like 2+ months to nerf them) or sometimes certain powerful decks survive a standard rotation, that cube lock survived the standard cycle is a disgrace, you expect fresh new decks and then you face the same shit.<br />
<br />
I'm going to miss Brode during card reveals but yeah, competition for card games is growing and Hearthstone currently relies more on it's community than the game itself to keep people entertained and after 3+ months after an expansion, a lot of Hearthstone streamers switch over to other games than play Hearthstone for 8+ hours a day on stream.</div></div><hr />

Next, card generation and (near) infinite value, if you played against a freeze mage in earlier days, you knew how much burn that Mage had, so you planned around 2xFrost Nova's, 2x Blizzard and so forth, however since a while ago there has been so much random card generation that a control mage suddenly had 3 or more Ice blocks, Blizzards and so forth, that's not cool to play against.<br />
<br />
Control Warrior used to be a &quot;value deck&quot; because of cards like Cairne, now these cards pale in comparison to the Death Knights cards and various other spells and minions that generate tons of value out of nothing.<br />
<br />
Lastly, the time it takes to nerf powerful cards &amp; decks, a balance patch every three months is simply not enough, the Meta in the last few years has gotten very stale after the first month or so, people were ready for shake ups, those however usually happen only if some decks are really out of control (which takes again like 2+ months to nerf them) or sometimes certain powerful decks survive a standard rotation, that cube lock survived the standard cycle is a disgrace, you expect fresh new decks and then you face the same shit.<br />
<br />
I'm going to miss Brode during card reveals but yeah, competition for card games is growing and Hearthstone currently relies more on it's community than the game itself to keep people entertained and after 3+ months after an expansion, a lot of Hearthstone streamers switch over to other games than play Hearthstone for 8+ hours a day on stream.<br />
<br />
And this is why I play TESL mostly, well said.</div></div><hr />

One misconception is that people leave out of sheer unhappiness when in reality, it can be detrimental to your career to stay in one place too long in the tech, entertainment, and video game industries. He's admittedly been at Blizzard for 15 years and his experience and notoriety from Hearthstone can (and likely will) land him an even more lucrative job at another company.<br />
<br />
You can stay at one place and hope you can work your way up the line or transition between companies every few years for an ever increasing salary and position that skips the glass ceiling effect that tends to happen in established companies. Chances are he's getting a bigger job at another company that pays more money.<br />
<br />
But anyways, he was seemingly a pretty great guy that has passion for his work. Hope he finds success wherever he goes.</div></div><hr />

but this post is about the fake brode, never liked him, and i'm surprised that he was that popular, unlike Ghostcrawler who at least was very good human being (but he was still face of many bad blizz decisions), brod feels like someone who enjoy bullying/trolling ppl, because he did troll ppl at least</div></div><hr />

as shown in 1502 video made by shitload of streamers and youtubers, do u REALLY see them test how game should work or balance? like seriously ?<br />
it took less than 1 day to build pirate warrior deck, if they were actually testing 'balance' during msog internal beta, they were testing how to play while smoking as much weed as possible then, or kotf with druid overlord that again fucked balance in 1st week, so claiming they actually 'test balance' is like like claiming pigs can fly, except pigs can fly sounds more realistic<br />
as for bugs, just check disguised toast will answer that, again pigs flying sounds fare more realistic than blizz testing 'game bugs'<br />
so now that testing bugs, or balancing is out, and art for at least 50% of cards is taken from warcraft tcg (already made since ages)... so what exactly is 'hard' they do?<br />
while i didn't play Yugi since ages, my friend who used to play it claim it is more balanced than hearthstone, and from watching HS no one can deny the game is 99% luck (or 'pure skill' as they like to call it) and 0.9% again luck then 0.1% luck because what else u need to win? the 'skill' that the card u get helps u win the game?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard canceled more games than any other company on the market right now. They are insane. They prototype like a hell and game has to go through several checkpoints to actually get it into serious production - and even then it is not the rule, it will be released.<br />
<br />
Now imagine you are relatively young passionate guy, who loves games and want create something different or something own - in blizzard, you will ever hardly get this chance - so you have two options - you will either stay in a good work but will probably never work on your dream game or risk it, leave and start doing something own. <br />
<br />
In general, leaving blizzard hardly ever proved as a good move - &gt; most companies funded by ex-blizzards crashed and burned or are forgotten but I really hope Ben will do something special.</div></div><hr />

depends I guess, if you want to make your own special game with your vision you wont have any luck inside blizzard, they make copy pasted games from genres and try to improve them or put their blizz touch on it, they are not a company making alot of random smaller games or something, what blizzard releases is very strict.</div></div><hr />

In a 27 year period they've cancelled 3 games that were known of or in a known development stage. That's hardly &quot;insane&quot;. At least learn how the industry works before commenting on it will you. Games being cancelled can happen quite a bit. The bigger names probably have way more cancelled games in their roster than Blizzard has over 27 years.<br />
<br />
Warcraft Adventures. A text based game which at the time Myst had already made it's name in that market.<br />
Starcraft: Ghost. A really poor looking Starcraft stealth game.<br />
Titan. The remnants became Overwatch because they didn't want to handle a second MMO.<br />
<br />
I hardly believe that bigger companies have cancelled 3 games or less in their lifetime.<br />
<br />
However other games that were briefly known of but with no major work done on them were Pax Imperia 2, Crixa, Nomad and Shattered Nations. But again these were barely spoken of and that would bring the full total to 7. Crixa and Nomad never saw the light of day other then being mentioned.<br />
<br />
And I can guarantee you 7 over a 29 year period is absolutely fuck all in terms of how many games companies like EA have cancelled.</div></div><hr />

That &quot;we&quot; know of. Never forget that. I'm sure they're going through concepts, arts and possibly even more than that for new games all the time where quite a few doesn't even make it through first cut.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is common. Not really something to be critical about. Any company in any design field does that. <br />
<br />
I mentioned the other 4 that went through barely any major public stages.<br />
<br />
Those 4 were at best tech demos and very unfinished in the first place.<br />
<br />
It's not uncommon for big game devs to cancel games and I imagine if people did their research they would find some bigger names cancelled way more games.<br />
<br />
Look at Warlords. That has a slew of cut content for example. It's just how the industry works. Concepts might end up just remaining concepts or content that might not have worked well gets cut or reworked.</div></div><hr />

I have no doubt the game quality will stay the same, but yet it will feel a bit less joyful when it doesn't have his laugh bringing the news to us.<br />
<br />
So much this. Both of them just had that enthusiasm and love for their game that can't really be replicated.</div></div><hr />

They are insane. They prototype like a hell and game has to go through several checkpoints to actually get it into serious production - and even then it is not the rule, it will be released.<br />
<br />
Now imagine you are relatively young passionate guy, who loves games and want create something different or something own - in blizzard, you will ever hardly get this chance - so you have two options - you will either stay in a good work but will probably never work on your dream game or risk it, leave and start doing something own. <br />
<br />
In general, leaving blizzard hardly ever proved as a good move - &gt; most companies funded by ex-blizzards crashed and burned or are forgotten but I really hope Ben will do something special.<br />
<br />
pretty much this, i recall few year back how blizzards working on few difrent ip game and heartstone was 1 of them and you never heard of saw anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few?<br />
<br />
Other than expansions back then this is what we know of that was being worked on around since at least 2010.<br />
<br />
Diablo 3. Released.<br />
Blizzard DotA/All Stars. Renamed to Heroes of the Storm and released.<br />
Hearthstone. Released.<br />
Titan. Game cancelled with assets supposedly used in Overwatch which was released.<br />
<br />
So out of 4 recent projects only 1 was cancelled. That's hardly anything. We literally saw everything alongside Hearthstone released with the exception of one game that was already cancelled before Hearthstone even happened. With some of that games assets/ideas being used for Overwatch.</div></div><hr />

People said this when Metzen, Pardo, Brower and Ghostcrwaler left. I believe the term was &quot;another rat flees the sinking ship&quot;.<br />
<br />
Still waiting on that ship to sink personally.</div></div><hr />

The game had to be developed and polished so yeah. He's been with Blizzard since his 20's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Companies cancel games if they do not live up to what they want it to be, hence why they are prototypes. You do know that 90% of any prototype in any sector, never make it past prototype right? I mean Nokia during the peak years, developed over 100 phones annually and eventually only half of them ever hit the market. Prototypes are trials, nothing more nothing less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ye, I get he has been in Blizzard during these 15 years, but didn't know it took them 6 years to develop the classic Hearthstone when they are lashing expansions out one after the other every few months :D :D :D</div></div><hr />

Wasn't Samwise the reason we got MoP? ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, he also worked on other games at Blizzard for a long time.<br />
<br />
There's a whole seperate site owned by the people who own mmo-champion devoted to hearthstone.... though this is more blizzard news then just hearthstone news.</div></div><hr />

This person was so rubbing salt in - HS is expensive as fuck and then this two faced &quot;friendly HAHAHA guy&quot; goes all happy dandy being friends with every HS player, meanwhile HS siphons so much dollars out of his &quot;friends&quot;. He wasn't your friend, he wasn't the designer, he was huge corporations mascot that funneled money from you.<br />
<br />
And he's gone! But yea, we'll get new mascot, still, feels good HAHAHAHAHA.<br />
<br />
What's it like existing in that perpetual state of joyless bitterness by the way? Cos I feel like my friends would think I were way cooler if I could affect such a dour stance to life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If yes, then it's even more of a loss. MoP was the last really good expansion. Except for the dailypalooza (forcing dailies for raid-gear/dungeon-gear/valor points) was the most stupid idea ever. But beside of this it was a very good expansion. Especially 5.2 was the best patch ever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JohnnyMccrum</div><div class="date">2018-04-21, 12:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I'd love Samwise to leave. He is an absolutely terrible artist. His older designs were entirely stolen from other works like Tolkien, and his method of making them &quot;more badass&quot; was just adding more spikes, but he added more and MORE spikes to the point where everything looked like a fucking mess. He is the main reason behind the shoulder problem, and the main reason boss design is so overcomplicated. He is also a huge weeb, he didn't contribute that much to WC3 at all asides from pandas. and he didn't contribute much since MoP, where he got a whole fucking expansion.<br />
<br />
Samwise will never leave Blizzard, because Blizzard is the only place that tolerates his complete and utter incompetence. Metzen had more sense.</div></div><hr />

Just like WoW did every time that X person left... :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ManiaCCC</div><div class="date">2018-04-21, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a 27 year period they've cancelled 3 games that were known of or in a known development stage. That's hardly &quot;insane&quot;. At least learn how the industry works before commenting on it will you. Games being cancelled can happen quite a bit. The bigger names probably have way more cancelled games in their roster than Blizzard has over 27 years.<br />
<br />
Warcraft Adventures. A text based game which at the time Myst had already made it's name in that market.<br />
Starcraft: Ghost. A really poor looking Starcraft stealth game.<br />
Titan. The remnants became Overwatch because they didn't want to handle a second MMO.<br />
<br />
I hardly believe that bigger companies have cancelled 3 games or less in their lifetime.<br />
<br />
However other games that were briefly known of but with no major work done on them were Pax Imperia 2, Crixa, Nomad and Shattered Nations. But again these were barely spoken of and that would bring the full total to 7. Crixa and Nomad never saw the light of day other then being mentioned.<br />
<br />
And I can guarantee you 7 over a 29 year period is absolutely fuck all in terms of how many games companies like EA have cancelled.<br />
<br />
Buddy, blizzard canceled dozens games. You mentioned just a few. Also Kaplan already mentioned, that prototyping games in Blizzard is easy - what is hard is to push it through all the technical, budget and marketing guys. <br />
Also Diablo 3 was canceled and restarted two times - just example - or more recent cancelation - King in the north expansion for Diablo. <br />
<br />
But point is, Blizzard structure is not allowing some crazy ideas and new IPs. It took them how many years to announce new IP? 14? For young passionate guys like Ben this is not just &quot;enough&quot;.. They want create new things and get it done in less than decade.<br />

<br />
Not at all - their history of canceled games is long - from nomad and pax in early days to more recent King in the hill expansion or Titan. <br />
<br />
Just look what they released in past 15 years. Keep in mind, they are one of the biggest, if not THE biggest game developing studio, yet, their portfolio is quite small. They are very VERY careful what they want to release. And many times, it is more about quality control, marketing goals, e-sport than some &quot;let's try something new and crazy&quot; - this is why so many ex-blizzard employees are trying new things in their own studios. Several Interview also supports this - working in Blizzard is great and dream job for many, however for creative process they are quite rigid.</div></div><hr />

Some people say cribbage is entirely a game of chance too until they get absolutely toasted by someone who's good at the game.<br />
or actually know, because everyone who played card games can't deny that hearthstone is the most RNG card game that exist, check any other card game out</div></div><hr />

I love my job, I've been with the same IT firm for the better part of a decade, I love the people I work with...but I just have this feeling that I'm stuck in a rut. I've recently been interviewing for positions elsewhere, I can't even put my finger on why I feel like I need to leave. It can happen to any of us.<br />
<br />
Besides the fact it was because hearthstone had a game plan and Ben wanted to change it and couldn't also helped the situation, look at how he acts he isn't unhappy.</div></div><hr />
