<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, we'll be making several changes to class talents and abilities across the board. Here, you'll get a glimpse at what's in store for the rogue class, including a look the new high-level abilities and an overview of how the new Mastery system will work with the rogue's different talent specs.<br />
<br />
New Rogue Abilities<br />
<br />
Redirect (available at level 81): Rogues will be getting a new ability to help them deal with changing targets. Redirect will transfer any active combo points to the rogue's current target, helping to ensure combo points aren't wasted when swapping targets or when targets die. In addition, self-buff abilities like Slice and Dice will no longer require a target, so rogues can spend extra combo points on those types of abilities (more on this below). Redirect will have a 1-minute cooldown and no other costs.<br />
<br />
Combat Readiness (level 83): Combat Readiness is a new ability that we intend rogues to trigger defensively. While this ability is active, whenever the rogue is struck by a melee or ranged attack, he or she will gain a stacking buff called Combat Insight that results in a 10% reduction in damage taken. Combat Insight will stack up to 5 times and the timer will be refreshed whenever a new stack is applied. Our goal is to make rogues better equipped to go toe-to-toe with other melee classes when Evasion or stuns are not in play. This ability lasts 6 seconds and has a 2-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
Smoke Bomb (level 85): The rogue drops a Smoke Bomb, creating a cloud that interferes with enemy targeting. Enemies who are outside the cloud will find themselves unable to target units inside the cloud with single-target abilities. Enemies can move inside the cloud to attack, or they can use area-of-effect (AoE) abilities at any time to attack opponents in a cloud. In PvP, this will open up new dimensions of tactical positional gameplay, as the ability offers a variety of offensive and defensive uses. In PvE, Smoke Cloud can serve to shield your group from hostile ranged attacks, while also drawing enemies closer without the need to rely on conventional line-of-sight obstructions. Smoke Cloud lasts 10 seconds and has a 3-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
Changes to Abilities and Mechanics<br />
<br />
We're also planning to make changes to some of the other abilities and mechanics you're already familiar with. This list and the summary of talent changes below it are by no means comprehensive, but they should give you a good sense of what we want for each spec.<br />
<br />
In PvP, we want to reduce the rogue's dependency on binary cooldowns and &quot;stun-locks,&quot; and give them more passive survivability in return. One major change is that we'll put Cheap Shot on the same diminishing return as other stuns. The increase to Armor and Stamina on cloth, leather, and mail gear will help with this goal as well.<br />
<br />
In PvE, even accounting for active modifiers like Slice and Dice and Envenom, a very large portion of the rogue's damage is attributable to passive sources of damage. Yes, they are using abilities for the entire duration of a fight, but we want to reduce the percentage of rogue damage that comes from auto-attacks and poisons. More of their damage will be coming from active abilities and special attacks.<br />
<br />
We would like to improve the rogue leveling experience. Positional attacks and DoT-ramping mechanics will be de-emphasized at low levels and then re-introduced at higher levels for group gameplay. We are also providing rogues with a new low-level ability, Recuperate, to convert combo points into a small heal-over-time (HoT).<br />
<br />
To complement the change to combo points, non-damage abilities such as Recuperate and Slice and Dice will no longer have target requirements and can be used with any of the rogue's existing combo points, including combo points remaining on recently killed targets. This will not affect damage abilities, which will still require combo points to be present on the specific target you want to damage. To coincide with this, the UI will be updated so that rogues know how many combo points they have active.<br />
<br />
Ambush will now work with all weapons, but will have a reduced coefficient when not using a dagger. When opening from Stealth, all rogues will be able to choose from burst damage, DoT abilities, or a stun.<br />
<br />
As we've done recently with some of the Subtlety abilities, we want to make sure more rogue abilities aren't overly penalized by weapon choice. With a few exceptions (like Backstab), you should be able to use a dagger, axe, mace, sword, or fist weapon without being penalized for most attacks.<br />
<br />
Deadly Throw and Fan of Knives will now use the weapon in the ranged slot. In addition, we hope to allow rogues to apply poisons to their throwing weapons.<br />
<br />
We are very happy with Tricks of the Trade as a general mechanic and as a way to give rogues more group utility, but we don't want it to account for as much threat transfer as it does now.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Talents and Talent Changes<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, the overall feel of each of the rogue's talent trees will change, as we would like each tree to have a clearly defined niche and purpose. The talent details below are meant to give you an idea of what we're going for.<br />
<br />
Assassination will be more about daggers, poisons, and burst damage.<br />
<br />
Combat will be all about swords, maces, fist weapons, axes, and being engaged toe-to-toe with your enemies. A Combat rogue will be able to survive longer without needing to rely on Stealth and evasion mechanics.<br />
<br />
The Subtlety tree will primarily be based around utilizing Stealth, openers, finishers, and survivability. It'll be about daggers, too, but less so than Assassination.<br />
<br />
In general, Subtlety rogues needs to do more damage than they do today, and the other trees need to have more tools.<br />
<br />
Weapon-specialization talents (for all classes, not just rogues) are going away. We do not want you to have to respec when you get a different weapon. Interesting talents, such as Hack and Slash, will work with all weapons. Boring talents, such as Mace Specialization and Close Quarters Combat, will be going away.<br />
<br />
The Assassination and Combat talent trees currently have a lot of passive bonuses. We plan to dial back the amount of Critical Strike Rating provided by these trees so that rogues still want it on their gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Assassination<br />
Melee damage<br />
Melee critical damage<br />
Poison damage<br />
<br />
Combat<br />
Melee damage<br />
Melee Haste<br />
Harder-hitting combo-point generators<br />
<br />
Subtlety<br />
Melee damage<br />
Armor Penetration<br />
Harder-hitting finishers<br />
<br />
The initial tier of rogue Mastery bonuses will be very similar between the trees. However, the deeper that a player goes into any tree, the more specialized and beneficial the Masteries will be to the play style for that spec. Assassination will have better poisons than the other two specs. Combat will have very steady and consistent overall damage. Subtlety will have strong finishers.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoyed this preview, and we're looking forward to hearing your initial thoughts and feedback on these additions and changes. Please keep in mind that this information represents a work in progress and is subject to change as development on Cataclysm continues.<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/deathknight.jpg Death Knight - New Rune Mechanics (Death Knight Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-death-knight/))<br />
Ghostcrawler explained the new rune mechanic in a blue post.<br />
I'll take a stab at explaining the rune mechanic. Once you see it in action, it's pretty easy to understand.<br />
<br />
Just focus on Blood Runes for the moment. The big change is that rune #2 will never start filling up until rune #1 is full. They always fill 1 then 2. Today 1 and 2 can both fill at the same time.<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm, when you're killing things, you use rune 1. Then any extra &quot;red&quot; in rune 2 will fill rune 1 back up again. If both of them are full, you can use 2 Blood Runes immediately. But after that, rune 1 will fill up first and then rune 2. If it helps, imagine rune 2 is the extra tank.<br />
<br />
This sounds like it will slow down DK attacks, and it will to a point. That's part of what we're trying to accomplish. We can then fill those extra GCDs with things like free abilities or runic power abilities or we have room to add talents that make runes fill faster. Remember, slow attacks can hit harder though. Instead of DKs hitting fast like a rogue, they'll hit slower and harder, like a warrior, which fits a lot of player's image of a DK anyway. Dual wield will hit faster of course.<br />
<br />
I'll try another comparison. Imagine that all rogue abilities cost 100 energy. They have to wait until they get 100 energy, and then immediately use an attack so that they aren't wasting future energy. That's how DKs play now, except they have 6 runes to watch. Now imagine the same rogue except all his abilities cost 50 energy. If he hits an attack when he has 60 energy, then 50 is consumed but he has 10 energy still left and a head start on the next attack. That's the way we want DKs to play.<br />
<br />
If that still doesn't make sense, then focus on what the experience will be, which is that you'll have more breathing room in your rotation and won't have to hit a button every single GCD. If you don't use a strike the second it's available, that's more okay because the extra tank will store extra rune resources rather than just wasting it. You'll still be hitting a lot of buttons though. We're keeping double rune strikes and Death Runes and disease multipliers and all of that. We'll have to make some changes in some abilities to accommodate the resource change, but it won't be unrecognizable to you.<br />
<br />
We're not sure DKs even need Rune Strike any longer. If it survives, we'll turn it into an instant swing. But if we turn it into an instant swing, then it really isn't that different from existing strikes so it's possible we can just make a tanking rotation without it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Like they said there's a lot of passive talents in the Rogue trees. Most likely you will get new talents in those trees, new offensive attacks. Just the ones announced that are not spec dependant do not feature any.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Health will be much higher compared to the ratio we see today. You will no longer get bursted in a few GCD, and you most probably won't use Combat Readiness as an OHSHIT! ability. At least I don't think so. So rather, you use it when you get focused and start getting damage instead of when you are at 10% HP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
combat readiness is fun.... imagine the noobs who dont know you've popped it giving you a perma shield wall..... cept i dont understand the idea that they want to fix our reliance on activated defenses when evasion is down, but a short-duration(if someone is paying attention) buff like this. makes no sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
in addition, their &quot;justification&quot; for putting cheap shot and kidney shot on the same DR is that EVERYONE is going to have more health and armor(making them tougher to kill) ........?<br />
<br />
I mean, dont get me wrong, i think its good its on the same DR, but they could at least do a better job at explaining things better than that have-baked answer.(we're nerfing your control, all those classes that you could hurt pretty bad now you can't hurt as bad..... this is balanced.....somehow)</div></div><hr />

Say a boss has a targetting attack, that he targets 10 players in a row, and smotes them with lasers.<br />

Damn brutal first post. <br />
<br />
Rogues are a lightly armored melee class capable of dealing massive damage to their enemies in a flurry of attacks. They are masters of stealth and assassination, passing by enemies unseen and striking from the shadows, then escaping from combat in the blink of an eye. Rogues can also craft poisons that damage or cripple their enemies, reducing their effectiveness in battle. Groups will find rogues valuable, for not only do they deal massive damage, but they can open locked doors or chests, and disarm hidden traps as well<br />
<br />
Technically, all of these changes still coincide with their original description. Maybe smoke cloud will work better than vanish though, we can only hope...</div></div><hr />

well.... not extending the talent trees(no new -end-of-tree- talent), and they ARENT giving us more spells that that(they are only giving 3 new spells out and those are them)..... so the only hope is that somewhere, theres enough talents takin out of our tree that &quot;give&quot; us a new attack.... which frankly, i doubt will happen, cuz lets face it, we have 1sinister strike, 2backstab, 3ghostly strike, 4hemo, 5mutilate.... and thats just combo-builders... we have 1evis, 2enven, 3rupture, 4deadlythrow i mean, we REALLY dont need extra attacks.

We are a class based on stealth - based on careful manipulation of our surroundings, using the threat and overbearing nature of our teammates and raid mates to allow us to smash into our enemies with a tactile precision. These changes seems to aim rogues all down the path of what we now call a combat rogue - everything seems to point towards making us fill the old position of fury warriors.... just dual wielding DPS classes that don't do anything but spam abilities and try to stay alive as long as we can. This is a one dimentional style of play that frankly, I find offensive as a long time rogue player.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, GTFO. I'm going to go level a mage, at least there invisibility is cool. Or maybe I'll go play my warrior, since they don't have to do stealth at all, and are much better at standing there and clubbing things.<br />
<br />
Terrible ideas. If this is all Blizzard does for rogues in Cata, I will certainly not be playing mine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What do people not understand about the word preview? Also and I ask you to NOT reroll a Mage as we already have enough whiners as it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only if you keep attacking them.<br />
<br />
if he pops it too low on health he dies anyways, if he pops it too high on health, you just peel off for a second, and come back to finish him. Its kind of like shieldwall, just the area of &quot;popped it too low on health&quot; seems quite a bit larger of a down-point when comparing the 2.<br />

<br />
think of Forge of Souls with all those annoying ranged mobs<br />
put a smoke bomb in the tank, and tada, no more ranged adds out of the tank's range<br />
<br />
in pve it is pretty much a death grip for ranged mobs<br />
<br />
Then they aim for the healers if they are outside the smoke. We all know how hard headed pugs are<br />
Rogue: Smoke bomb away! everyone get inside it!<br />
Ranged: screw you! im setting up a rotation<br />
*Ranged dies* <br />
Ranged: WTF! its the tanks fault and the rogues for not placing it on top of me!<br />

Some of you folk are apparently not clever enough to see its PvE applications, but then some Warlocks don't use Demonic Circle on most fights. Clever people will find excellent uses for the spell, and don't be surprised if Blizzard throws in the occasional add-intensive encounter where Anti-Magic Zones and/or Smoke Bombs can make things smoother.<br />
<br />
<br />
People have already mentioned how Smoke bomb is primarily a pvp ability. Of course it has uses in pve but with a three minute cooldown it is limited.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand why blizzard stills favors this class on PvP, seriously. Not trolling, just I don't understand why they get more and more tools to avoid damage and improve survival.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of these things are really good changes. I really like the idea of moving away from stunlock, I really wish they'd just get rid of cheap shot all together, I feel like its holding rogue back from getting a lot of other stuff because it would be too OP with the amount of stunlock rogue has. I wish they'd go farther away from stunlock and more into abilities to return to stealth.<br />
<br />
Making FoK go off the ranged weapon finally is good, it was weird that I was throwing swords and axes and such. <br />
<br />
I don't think the talent trees will be that much more specialized than they are now, it's still going to be melee dps, melee dps, or melee dps. I'm glad they're getting rid of the weapon specialization talents, those are a bit annoying.<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of smoke bomb, I think it's a neat idea for an ability. *however* as our level 85 ability? There's no arguing its a pure PvP ability, and for those of us who don't pvp, it really doesn't give me much urge to level to 85. I look at the other classes and the new things they're getting and feel much more desire to get them to 85 to play with those. This makes leveling rogue those last 5 levels sort of ho-hum. Maybe I'll be waiting to see what paladin ends up with. Get him to 85, then do rogue when I get around to it, maybe after shaman if I feel like dinking around in pvp.</div></div><hr />

Redirect will transfer any active combo points to the rogue's current target, helping to ensure combo points aren't wasted when swapping targets or when targets die. In addition, self-buff abilities like Slice and Dice will no longer require a target, so rogues can spend extra combo points on those types of abilities (more on this below). Redirect will have a 1-minute cooldown and no other costs.<br />

Some clarifications regarding what &quot;All equivalent debuffs&quot; entail: <br />
<br />
&quot;All equivalent debuffs&quot; means if you have the debuff today, you will have it in Cataclysm, but at 20% healing received. To avoid further confusion, we are talking about Mortal Strike, Furious Strikes, Wound Poison, Aimed Shot, Permafrost and Improved Mind Blast. <br />

This is a fair and very good review. Every review is greeted with disdain by partisans who want their class to receive an incredible boost in power from new abilities. Smoke Bomb looks fantastic, and if you seriously cannot fathom the incredibly potent strategic uses of an AOE that blocks out incoming ranged attacks then stay the hell out of my Battlegrounds, please.<br />
<br />
And, again, it's going to be one of those spells where smart Rogues use it in all the right situations in PvE- to protect healers from ranged aggro, to help LOS pulls, whatever they throw at us- and are beloved by all... and crappy Rogues whine about how they want more powerful offensive abilities and wonder why nobody wants them in their guild.</div></div><hr />

Blizz wants to reduce auto attack and poison damage, yet they don't give us any new offensive abilities... Instead they give us defensive cool downs. Unless smoke bomb chokes enemies to death with a darth vader style force choke.... I don't see how we are going to &quot;out DPS hybrids&quot; like Blizz says they want pure DPS classes to do in Cata.<br />
<br />
I think we are going to see the way of the finishing moves going the way of the Dodo bird. If they try to give us that damage back in sinister strike or mutilate or Hemo... we're going to have huge damage from our generating abilities, and then shitty comparable damage from our finishers.... It seems to me it should be the other way around. Retardedly huge finishers, smaller generators.</div></div><hr />

Why does everyone think rogues are gods?.................... a hot that is a &quot;low level ability&quot; meant to ease their solo play. Its not gunna do anything better than demon-armor or whatever you warlocks have at the end of day.<br />
<br />
Rogues got nerfed in their preview and everyone rejoices(instead of 2 stun DR's, both cheap-kidney are combined into the same).... THIS MEANS the opening &quot;10 second &lt;dead in a stunlock&gt;&quot;(if you dont trinket) is now a max of 7 seconds. and if they vanish cheap you again, .... yeah... Instead of being able to stun you with chain vanish's till oblivion, you'll go immune quite fast if we do it that way.<br />
<br />
But of course... rogues are gods.... [rolls eyes]<br />
<br />
and cloak of shadows? i bet you it wont negate incoming spells already, it doesn't drop DoTs off you. And you can just AOE the smoke if you dont wanna go in it while waiting(Shadow fury! if ur destro)<br />

Apparently the rogue forum is filled with people that dont read. They said that if you use swords or other weapons that you wont do as much damage with abilities like backstab.

You sir, are retarded. It doesn't protect you from damage. Any competent player will just run up and AoE you, and no more flag capping. If you have a healer pulling aggro in a heroic, your tank is retarded.

The coefficient for using other weapons will be lower with those abilities, sure. But they never make it better to use one weapon over the other for any specific kind of ability, unless it is a weapon specific talent. And, slower weapons work better for white damage and poisons ( to some extent, don't critique that too thoroughly). I just don't see how normalizing weapon damage is going to encourage the use of daggers.</div></div><hr />

That being said, it is likely we will similar technology used in abilities for other classes. Since it didn't exists pre-Cata, Blizz obviously hasn't created any content in which it would be necessary/useful. They will be creating encounters with the new abilities in mind, so it might seem more useful once we see the content. Plus, once it is in players' hands, there is a fair bit of room for creativity with this ability, so it might turn out to be situationally very useful. <br />
<br />
Also, it seems some people might be suggesting that a mob will go after ranged rather than charge into the smoke cloud to pursue their previous target. I didn't think we knew yet. Do we?<br />
<br />
I'm hoping there will be some talented buff to Vanish when used within the cloud like dots not breaking stealth. Vanishing after a smokebomb is well cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Smoke Bomb (level 85): The rogue drops a Smoke Bomb, creating a cloud that interferes with enemy targeting. Enemies who are outside the cloud will find themselves unable to target units inside the cloud with single-target abilities. Enemies can move inside the cloud to attack, or they can use area-of-effect (AoE) abilities at any time to attack opponents in a cloud. In PvP, this will open up new dimensions of tactical positional gameplay, as the ability offers a variety of offensive and defensive uses. In PvE, Smoke Cloud can serve to shield your group from hostile ranged attacks, while also drawing enemies closer without the need to rely on conventional line-of-sight obstructions. Smoke Cloud lasts 10 seconds and has a 3-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
Just in case a hunter ever, ever, ever, ever even THOUGHT about killing a rogue.</div></div><hr />

But they never make it better to use one weapon over the other for any specific kind of ability, unless it is a weapon specific talent. And, slower weapons work better for white damage and poisons ( to some extent, don't critique that too thoroughly). I just don't see how normalizing weapon damage is going to encourage the use of daggers.<br />
<br />
Again READ...they said that they are going to redue all coefficients spells and weapons. Just like in the shammy with the new overload proc that lets lava burst be affected. In the Q&amp;A they said all coefficients will be redone to make sure things are op'd. So they will be doing coefficients to make sure that daggers will do more damage to &quot;dagger&quot; abilities. With this they are opening up more abilities that can be used by all specs.

If you go back and read my previous posts, I'm mostly interested in Blizzard not pushing us into a leather-armor-wearing-warrior, and fixing our OLD abilities that work just fine. We literally have an ability for every offensive situation you can think of. Why change a good thing, unless you make it better? Blizzard just took like 5 years of rogue tradition and shit on it to make us more 'defensive', and able to stand toe-to-toe. FUCK THAT.

<br />
I see a lot of complaints about PvE and pure damage abilities. People like that should just play a mage, there's your pure dps. And make us a magical sandwich while you're crying in the kitchen!<br />
<br />
As for PvE use for Smoke Bomb, not all tanks are perfect at pulling in caster mobs. Another example would be the trash mobs from the ice boss in VoA that launch painfully big frostbolts. (Accidentally get targeted by two at the same time = instant death) People will find out more uses, but that requires you to think instead of whine about it on a forum.</div></div><hr />

Patience, young one. To judge someone only by their past mistakes is foolish, and close-minded. How would anyone have a chance to improve if they were judged only by the mistakes they have made, and not what they have been allowed to accomplish? A quiet mind and a touch of hope brings light to stunning opportunities. <br />

I understand where you are coming from here - (not the preview part, there's no point in even having this discussion if you want to just write all of it off as worthless). Blizz has made those claims in the Shaman thread in particular, and in some of the others. But they also claimed that they want all the rogue abilities to be useful no matter what weapons you have (excepting Mutilate I think they said, or BS. Whatever). So I read that as they will make all weapons do equivalent damage with regard to their speed in terms of the finishers. Let me explain:<br />
<br />
A finisher with a dagger may do a big fat number. Say 20k damage. But then because of the way daggers work with the other abilities and white damage attacks, it will be about the same total damage as a rogue with axes, whos finisher was only 15k, but does more with white/poison/abilities.<br />
<br />
I don't think Blizzard can both push more daggers and normalize weapon damage across all abilities. Does not compute is what I'm saying.</div></div><hr />

If you're fighting against a warrior you should know how to deal with it. The smoke bomb can be a pretty good distraction, if you manage to stealth away fast enough. Warrior charges in, finds out there's no rogue and then BAM! Daggers in his ass.</div></div><hr />

I think the preview part is very legit. Im not writing it off as worthless...im saying this is just a taste, nothing final and certainly these arent the only things that will get put in. But everyone is bitching about how rogues got shit on. Why because of a couple abilities they decided to let you in on. Im just saying take everything with a grain of salt, there will be other things added. <br />
<br />
And now to the other part. I do see what your saying about daggers having there effect on white damage, but again if you read they say they want to reduce white damage and make rogues more on their abilites...so ya combat will be able to use abilities no that require daggers with swords now..but at a cost of lower damage, but their abilities they do use will compensate for that.<br />
<br />
On the other hand you use daggers, ull get your big numbers from your abilities requiring daggers and your OTHER abilities in your tree that will balance the damage out. Since reducing the amount of white damage vs actual abilites that will balance out the coefficient variable with the weapons. Does that make sense? (and no that isnt sarcastic just seeing if u see were im seeing this side of it)</div></div><hr />

Yes getting everything you want would be nice. But talk about gimicky &quot;omega&quot; abilities. Before all this has been released.

Turning in combo points for a heal will be great for leveling and soloing, I for one only got to lvl 70 once with my rogue because it was tedious and usually too much downtime for my taste (having mostly played druid, warlock before). So no wonder why.<br />
<br />
As for smoke bomb, you wont be targetable. How would that work out for soloing, I mean would the mob/mobs evade? or would they just stand there looking dumb while you where in the smoke cloud and for example bandage yourself.<br />

ya because Redirect has no PvE utility at all. Or the fact that you can now use abilities previously lock with weapon restrictions (i know at a cost see my previous post) <br />
<br />
Or the fact taht you dont need a target for envenom or slice and dice.<br />
<br />
Or being able to put poisons on throwing weapons.<br />
<br />
Its stupid posts like this that bog down these forums WAY too much</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taraxacum</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I just hope they are going to be doing some nice reworking of the talent tree's to go with these changes. I like the sound of a lot of the changes but they so far seam very PvP orientated. As a DPS class I'm surprised most of the changes are to do with survivability - were getting larger health pools, more armour, a HoT, defensive damage reduction, further means to be non targetable. Is it me or am I not seeing much damage there?<br />
<br />
They are doing away with the specific weapon base for skills/talents is good so any weapon will suit us, though it does also state that assassination will be more dagger based - a slight contradiction there I feel. Assasination is stated as being more burst based for damage (there must be a load of changes there to come PvE wise) which will be interesting to see how they plan to achieve that as currently that's Combats speciality. The other thing that's going to be interesting to see them achieve is keeping our DPS competitive. Were loosing a lot of Crit bonus from talents (presumably to help reduce our white damage as they stated) but I'm so far not seeing ways how this is going to be compensated for.<br />

So in my view a lot of nice things for people who PvP but nothing really new for those that do PvE. Yes they COULD all be used in PvE but we'd be relying on specific situations on encounters to use them and I cant see that happening. The whole base of a lot of changes and reworking here it to help 'bring the player not the class'.</div></div><hr />

If you're seeing that happening, then the rogues you run with are terrible. I'd argue rogues have more survivability than many other classes during raids. Between feint, cloak, evasion and vanish-immuning there's not much that another class can survive through better than a rogue in a raid.</div></div><hr />

You must raid with some seriously bad rogues, the kind that doesn't know feint is a survival ability and who haven't vanish immuned anything in their life. In our raids rogues rarely die even when rest of the raid wipes.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, rogues can also easily become to immune to attacks that would otherwise kill them (which means they can also simply continue dpsing while all other have to run away).</div></div><hr />

Maybe the rogues in all the raids I'm in do suck, maybe there's only a small percentage of rogues that can raid properly. And that would mean Blizzard is catering to those 'bad' rogues.<br />

dont get me wrong, i see it useful. but in a rotation on an average 5-7 minute boss fight where switching to adds is a necessity, i think it should be a passive ability and not something that needs to be triggered with a 1 min cooldown.<br />

Or the fact that you can now use abilities previously lock with weapon restrictions (i know at a cost see my previous post) <br />
<br />
Or the fact taht you dont need a target for envenom or slice and dice.<br />
<br />
Or being able to put poisons on throwing weapons.<br />
<br />
Its stupid posts like this that bog down these forums WAY too much<br />
<br />
<br />
Redirect could be great if not for the 1 minute cooldown. It will probably be as weak as Cold Blood for PvE in practice. It's not a bad change, but its less of a real buff and more of a quality of life change.<br />
<br />
You can already use weapons with restrictions, you simply hit a weapon swap macro and eat a slight swing reset penalty. Again, a quality of life change.<br />
<br />
You still need combo points for SnD, you just don't have to pay attention to the mobs health to make sure to pop it before they die. Yet another quality of life change. Envenom is a damaging attack that also gives a very, very short duration self buff, so I don't see how you could use that without a target.<br />
<br />
Putting poisons on throwing weapons will be nice for PvE, but it won't offset being forced to use throwing weapons in order to FoK along with the loss of a second poison being applied while doing said AoE. In order to apply multiple poisons through AoE we will need to start weapon swapping, and even then, the poison application is weaker since you can only apply one at a time. This feels like the reverse of a quality of life change. Also, in PvP you will use a throwing weapon for deadly throw, but in PvE a lot of the better stat sticks for rogues are hunter weapons. So, unless blizz doesn't make a single bow, gun, crossbow with better rogue stats than throwing, we're going to need to sacrifice AoE capability in order to maximize single target dps.</div></div><hr />

i can understand why they didnt give us any new direct damaging abilities. Rogues are really well balanced from my perspective and adding another direct damaging attack to our already quite powerful arsenal could go 2 ways.<br />
<br />
1. Making for insanely stupid and complex rotations that only the super elite will be smart enough to use (i know wows hard rite, but people are stupid)<br />
2. Make us stupidly OP and then the tear shedders come out of the closet.<br />
<br />
I personally dont think smoke bomb will make it to live, too easy to have it being stupid op in pvp and stupidly useless in pve. Masterys look interesting and the new hot/snd mechanics are handy for pvpers and new player/alts but outside of that, really kinda meh.<br />
<br />
The only thing im really happy about atm is redirect finally being included, was horrible to constantly lose combat points without having the reflexs of an elven ranger(reading day of the dragon atm, gogo knaakzulu!).<br />
<br />
All in all, just hold out for a while, these arent set in stone and probably will change in the near future. But if not, looks like my pally will become my new main.<br />

<br />
exactly! right before your target is dead, use the remaining CPs to SnD...<br />
<br />
in most cases, its no more than one or two CPs on an almost-dead target anyways. Why waste a 1 min CD on 2 CPs? will it realllly effect your total dmg output after a 7 minute fight? highly doubt it.<br />
In a current situation, i could see it being more useful for mutilate rogues to keep up a steady dps cycle when not on single target bosses like Saurfang and Festerf**k. for Combat, its nowhere near as necessary to have.</div></div><hr />

Wait. Hold on.<br />
<br />
The rogue drops a Smoke Bomb, creating a cloud that interferes with enemy targeting. Enemies who are outside the cloud will find themselves unable to target units inside the cloud with single-target abilities.<br />
Units. Not just 'enemies' or 'friendly targets' but 'units'.<br />

To clarify on Combat Readiness: when activated being hit will build up the Combat Insight buff. If not struck within 6 seconds of the last hit it will fall off and the Combat Readiness state will end. If the rogue continues to be hit however Combat Insight will continue to reapply, and it can be applied up to a maximum of 30 seconds total.<br />
<br />
<br />
Numbers aren't quite hammered out yet but it restores based on max health and the more combo points used the longer it lasts. While it's introduced as a low level ability it obviously scales with gear and base health upgrades (being based on max health and all) and be useful for more than just leveling.</div></div><hr />

Combat Insight will stack up to 5 times and the timer will be refreshed whenever a new stack is applied.

Smoke Bomb (level 85): The rogue drops a Smoke Bomb, creating a cloud that interferes with enemy targeting. Enemies who are outside the cloud will find themselves unable to target units inside the cloud with single-target abilities. Enemies can move inside the cloud to attack, or they can use area-of-effect (AoE) abilities at any time to attack opponents in a cloud. In PvP, this will open up new dimensions of tactical positional gameplay, as the ability offers a variety of offensive and defensive uses. In PvE, Smoke Cloud can serve to shield your group from hostile ranged attacks, while also drawing enemies closer without the need to rely on conventional line-of-sight obstructions. Smoke Cloud lasts 10 seconds and has a 3-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
can just give that right back to u...it says units inside the cloud, so maybe aoe heals, but no singletarget heals.</div></div><hr />

Combat readiness will be mostly useless in raids. It will be useful in battlegrounds against idiots, but against skilled players will basically be a &quot;don't touch him for 6 seconds, then blow him up&quot; cooldown, which can be ignored if the rogue waits for low health to pop it. It will be used often in PvP, but won't be the amazing ability some are making it out to be. I will love it for soloing though.<br />
<br />
Recuperate will have plenty of use for soloing and battlegrounds. I really don't see it having any use in raids though, and I worry that bad healers in 5 mans will use it as an excuse to not heal through unavoidable damage. Im looking forward to see what I'll be able to solo with it though.<br />

Smoke bomb will be useful in PvE to the extent that you can save your raid a wipe when you bring your raider's wife's friend's husband in to tank something on an offnight and he doesn't know how to LoS or taunt properly. Otherwise it seems like a nice way to try to restealth in battlegrounds or buy time to get a heal in arenas.<br />
<br />
Overall though, I think I'm more excited about the DK and shaman changes seeing as I have a Blood DK tank alt and a Restoration Shaman healer alt. After seeing those, the rogue abilities seem a bit underwhelming.</div></div><hr />

While this ability is active, whenever the rogue is struck by a melee or ranged attack, he or she will gain a stacking buff called Combat Insight that results in a 10% reduction in damage taken. Combat Insight will stack up to 5 times and the timer will be refreshed whenever a new stack is applied. Our goal is to make rogues better equipped to go toe-to-toe with other melee classes when Evasion or stuns are not in play. This ability lasts 6 seconds and has a 2-minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
So this means i will have the chance to tank bosses in pve ??? <br />
What do you guys think about that combo transefer thingy?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're talking the last 1-3% of a mob's health, you can already do that with evasion. Otherwise, no, you won't be tanking. It has a 30 second maximum duration by the way, and you'd be getting smashed to pieces while getting the stacks up, plus you won't be crit immune.</div></div><hr />

&quot;combat readiness&quot; seems easy enough to make useless in pvp. someone just hit the rogue once to get it to proc, then wait 6 seconds (attack the rogues teammates). after 6 seconds, the buff drops off and starts a 2 minute cooldown. then everyone is free to attack the rogue and be sure that he won't get the defensive bonus. surely this makes the new skill useless, and blizzard will have to find a new way to implement it in beta.<br />
<br />
Expecting people in PvP to not be idiots that want to unload their abilities all at the same time is...unrealistic, at best. The only time I ever see people wait before attacking someone is when a paladin bubbles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2) Cheapshot on diminishing returns... lol.<br />
<br />
3) Smokebomb looks like a good development for the game. If it works like previous posters say (ie. a target from outside the smoke unable to heal/buff a team mate inside the smoke) then one of two things is gonna happen. They gonna make it so YOUR friendly units, including yourself cant be healed/buffed inside the smoke also AND/OR itll be nerfed to hell and back because every 5s team will have a rogue... Race to see who can gib the other teams healer quicker?<br />

Those are usable at low health to mitigate large amounts of damage. 10% per stack that stacks up to 50% is something you'd have to use when you first see the train headed your way, or paired with someone else's defensive cooldown to get the stacks built up. If the rogue is down to 20% health before popping this, they'll get bursted down to 6.5% health instead of 5%, then finished in the next hit anyway. It's not a bad ability, just not something super amazing either.<br />

No, the sword ambushes will hit for about the same as dagger ambushes, or possibly less as a 'penalty'. The damage modifier will be adjusted accordingly. Look at the new state of hemo and imagine the same idea applied to ambush.</div></div><hr />

I guess you should use it when you are on 80% to avoid getting to 5% health as you will be a bad target to attack. (I don't know anything about pvp)<br />
<br />
On Smoke Bomb, this will produce interesting uses in PvE. I assume that firendly units can kinda see through the cloud. If so it can be cast in a &quot;random mob instagibbing healers&quot;. I hope that encouters will be designed so there is a use for the ability :)<br />

That's pretty much how it would be used, though using it as low as 60% probably wouldn't be terrible if you had a healer. Still, most defensive cooldowns can be used effectively at more critical levels, so I'm a bit torn.<br />
<br />
As for smoke bomb, I see it as artifically enforcing LoS rules, such that the mobs instagibbing the healers will continue to instagib said healers. They just will stop casting spells and wade into melee range to do said gibbing.</div></div><hr />

Non-targeted abilities can hit creatures inside since they do not require LoS. Targeted abilities, including friendly heals or buffs, cannot target any creature inside the smokebomb area from the outside. It is a pretty basic effect that has existed in RPGs since day 1 (I am pretty sure it existed in 1E D&amp;D as fog cloud). This means that they have the code now to create such effects on the fly in combat which can lead to very interesting raid encounters as well.</div></div><hr />

Smoke Bombs should logical have identical behaviour on mob AI and aggro with corner pulls. Both are circumstances that break line of sight. So if say the rogue, the tank and the mage are inside the smoke bomb but the dps DK and the holy priest are outside, the bombs will react the same way they would if the tank corner pulled the mobs and the rogue and mage also hid, but the DK and priest didn't.</div></div><hr />

that is what I thought, was commenting on someone saying that the ranged fighting mob will come inside the cloud to smack people, which is not true as you say.<br />
<br />
looking at all the new stuff they are addind to all classes and fact how much time they have before cataclysm, I think that 99% of these new cool abilities will make it to live servers, sounds like finally they will put less stress on pushing numbers with perfect &quot;fingering&quot; and add more functional gameplay into pve and spread it more over classes in pvp.<br />
Or they might just want everyone to feel excited and then they fail to implement 99% of it....<br />

Redirect will transfer any active combo points to the rogue's current target, helping to ensure combo points aren't wasted when swapping targets or when targets die. In addition, self-buff abilities like Slice and Dice will no longer require a target, so rogues can spend extra combo points on those types of abilities (more on this below). Redirect will have a 1-minute cooldown and no other costs.<br />
<br />
I still don't understand why they won't simply allocate combo points to the rogue rather than a target, seem like this ability to transfer CPs from one target to another, on a 1-minute cooldown, is just messy. While I can understand it would be insanely imbalanced with the current way CPs are generated, they could simply address the ease of building CPs so quickly (fewer ways or at a slower pace, etc).</div></div><hr />

SnD has always been a personal buff. The CP transfer is on a 1 minute CD. If you think rogues are amazing at single target dps like festergut, check out kitties, furies and arcanes; not to mention bears who can switch to kitty form with the 9 stack up.<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't balance around 2s. I wouldn't consider smoke bomb a CC. Stuns are being nerfed. Rogues can't &quot;insta apply&quot; all debuffs. I'd love to get crippling+wound+mind numbing+deadly all up in 1 button press. Sap is a CC that can't be used on you if you stay in combat or if the rogue isn't in stealth. Blind is a CC on a long cooldown. Gouge is an incapacitate that breaks on damage, and most rogues are running envenom which requires the DoT of deadly poison to function. Prolonged stunlock is gone with the CS nerf.<br />
<br />
Shadow Priests got a new nuke for situations like nuking down a spike, ice block or blood beast. Rogues still need to wait for poisons to stack and debuffs to get up regardless before theyre back up the maximum DPS. Damaging a target without sunders up lowers overall dps quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

Smoke Bomb does create a very interesting raiding mechanic as well. You can use it to determine who gets hit by random targeted boss abilities. Obviously unless you stack rogues like crazy it is not dependable, but you can once per 3 minutes hide the entire raid. This reminds me of LoS based mechanics in raiding which are scarce these days (Sindragosa has one, but admittedly it does not take any real effort to hide behind the tombs), particularly the drakes in BWL.<br />
<br />
In fact between Smoke Bomb and healing rain (the new shaman AoE healing spell) I see a pattern. Helpful targeted AoE spells can reinforce the somewhat forgotten raid mechanic of contracting the raid in groups for healing purposes.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if it would also work at Queen lana'thel in ariel mode. Now, granted, these are all easilly dealt with regardless by normal thinking and reacting, but it's not beyond the realms of Blizzard to change some mechanics in Cata where it could be handy.<br />

If its a cast at feet however it's a big Meh in PVE other than some very specific uses, and used as a gimmick more than anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Usually you blow defensive CDs when you're low on health or when burst is coming, but this ability seems pretty useless for that since it has ramp up time =/<br />

Oh come now, as a healbot priest, letting rogues die during a boss fight is one of the simple pleasures I will still very much allow myself to indulge in.</div></div><hr />

lets not forget these things are not a 100% its just to see how it well <br />
work take warrior for example Lot of THINGS were nerfed countless spells for other<br />
classes as well.<br />
<br />
bottom line is [well Burst pvp well remain?]<br />
<br />
if its still the same there is no reason to pvp anymore and ofc not 100% of wow players<br />
are hardcore in pve you can only find 2-3good guilds in each server EU/US so it come to<br />
5k-10k players who really hardcore pve and millions who pvp.<br />
<br />
when i say hardcore pve i mean [spending the next 8hours finishing raids everyday]</div></div><hr />
