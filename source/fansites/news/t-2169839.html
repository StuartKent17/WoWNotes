Are you downloading the PTR for the first time? I'd be hard pressed to believe the build is that big.</div></div><hr />

I updated it this morning first, it was fully installed. Then it wanted to update this afternoon, 12gb.</div></div><hr />

Lord baby Jesus in the manger.... What the hell would take up that amount of space in a single PTR build? Would the Tomb of Sargeras raid and assets seriously be that huge?<br />

Holy shit, those crafted legenadries are actually kind of cool. Makes sense that they're geared towards outdoor content instead of raids/dungeons.</div></div><hr />

I'd never take that off, it's a guaranteed equip when out in the world. Just FLAT OUT immunity to stealth and invis? That's crazy, I'm so sad I'm not a clothie.<br />
<br />
The movement speed/flight thing for leather/mail is cool I guess, but considering we'll have flying mounts anyways I don't really see it as being a big deal. Movement speed/passive flight don't matter much when you have flying mounts, the entire point is sort of negated. It's nowhere NEAR as powerful as the stealth-sight thing. I'd kill for that, and I've got Spectral Sight.</div></div><hr />

hey fellow fire mages, we complained enough. Now we get a buff. !</div></div><hr />

<br />
Item - Warrior T20 Protection 2P Bonus (New) Berserker Rage generates 0 Rage.<br />

And thinks &quot;Yeah, that's the one. That's what prot warriors need.&quot;. And then they can't even be bothered to put a 4 piece bonus into this build as well.</div></div><hr />

Fire isn't really as great when Ilvl goes up, compared to other specs.<br />
<br />
the only problem is that it looks like a flat +18% damages on spells.<br />
It cannot go live like that, or fire mage will come from the bottom to the top of rankings.<br />
<br />
One other important thing is that this flat buff on spell power % makes intelligence even more valuable now, regardless of any secondary stats, Ilvl will be more and more relevent for dps increase. Even more than now 7.1.5</div></div><hr />

Are you seriously? This is nonsense of some sort, it would be better returned 5% in stone fist and 4p - it's not even funny, my blood boiling in 810 has more damage than the shaman crushing lightning in 891.. <br />

They are doing this to most of the single target classes - enabling higher cleave and aoe output via single target spell usage. I'm going to assume Tomb has a lot of aoe in it.</div></div><hr />
