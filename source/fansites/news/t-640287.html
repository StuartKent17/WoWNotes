<meta name="description" content="23/03 Ulduar testing schedule updated 
The PTR testing schedule has been updated. The Flame Leviathan encounter was heavily bugged when it was tested on PTR yesterday and it wouldn't be surprising to see a new build deployed on PTRs tonight or early tomorrow to fix the issues before the testing. Stay tuned?  
Here's the current schedule for Ulduar PTR testing: 
 
On the North American test realms: 
 
Flame Leviathan - Tuesday Night, March 24, starting at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT.

The PTR testing schedule has been updated. The Flame Leviathan encounter was heavily bugged when it was tested on PTR yesterday and it wouldn't be surprising to see a new build deployed on PTRs tonight or early tomorrow to fix the issues before the testing. Stay tuned? <br />
Here's the current schedule for Ulduar PTR testing:<br />
<br />
On the North American test realms:<br />
<br />
Flame Leviathan - Tuesday Night, March 24, starting at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT.<br />
Hodir (Hard Mode) - Wednesday Night, March 25, starting at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT.<br />
<br />
On the European test realms:<br />
<br />
Flame Leviathan - Tuesday Night, March 24 at 19:00 CET.<br />
General Vezax (Hard Mode) - Wednesday Night, March 25 at 19:00 CET.<br />
<br />
Emalon the Storm Watcher is also available to be tested in the Vault of Archavon depending on PTR Wintergrasp status. Test Patchwerks will also be available on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
For Hard Mode testing, Shirts of Uber (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?item=45280) will be available on Ursula McWeaksauce to help simulate a raid having obtained Ulduar gear. Check the entrance area of Ulduar for the vendor.<br />
<br />
This schedule could change at a moment's notice due to server, bug, or patch status. I'll try to keep everyone informed as much as possible. Ulduar and the bosses to be tested will remain also open a variable length of time. How long they stay open depends upon a host of factors including designer availability, bug status, etc. We're very interested in seeing combat logs and parses for all raid testing on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Quick Ulduar FAQ:<br />
Q) Where's all the trash?<br />
A) Trash has now been completed, and players will see the trash associated with each boss during their tests.<br />
<br />
Q) Where's the loot?<br />
A) All loot should be present.<br />
<br />
Q) What about achievements?<br />
A) Should all be complete now. As always, please report any bugs. <br />
<br />
Emalon the Stormwatcher<br />
It's probably a good time to talk about Emalon, a new wing has been added to the Vault of Archavon with Patch 3.1. The end boss is Emalon the Stormwatcher (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/march/emalon.jpg).<br />

Those chambers are the connection between Dragonblight and important bases of the dragonflights = doesnt mean that all are raid instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basic facts that almost everyone knows.<br />
But I'm pretty sure I overheared somewhere that a new wing is opening there.<br />
Or it was probably this new VoA wing, since this came as a surprise for me, I'm not sure :p</div></div><hr />

Do you know if it just inc stats by 8% not inc SP? Maybe it's worded poorly. Who knows....</div></div><hr />

The shirt also adds 152 spell power.</div></div><hr />

What. The shirts are for testing hard-mode encounters on the PTR. Just for the PTR.</div></div><hr />

reading is the real hard mode....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Viserion</div><div class="date">2009-03-24, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just for clarification the shirt adds 130 to each rating (spell, crit, haste, hit, etc.) and 8% to each statistic. So what you get from your stats (Crit from Int for instance) will add to the 130 on top of each rating.<br />
<br />
Int = 100<br />
Crit(rating not percentage) = 100<br />
(puts on shirt)<br />
<br />
Int = 108<br />
Crit = 230 + New percentage after 108 crit from int</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it would if you had a talent that gives you SP from another stat, ie: Mind Mastery. Which is exactly what the person you quoted was saying they don't have.<br />
<br />
Read next time.</div></div><hr />
