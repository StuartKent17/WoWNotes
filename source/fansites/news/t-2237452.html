Considering the announcement said <br />
After deliberating over the many exceptional entries, our judges have chosen four outstanding pieces by two very talented artists. I would say no, you aren't the only one who noticed.<br />
<br />
Most likely they just were, simply, the best, alternating between best character/environment. It would have been nice to see what others came up with, though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jademist</div><div class="date">2017-06-16, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woah...someone from my small Uni won the art contest.</div></div><hr />

I noticed this as well. Really shows how many people are still playing (or care), it seems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. would be an awesome new NPC or even player race and indian culture could be quite interesting to explore in a WOW setting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had skimmed through the text, but my point still stands that out of the all the entries, only 2 people managed to be noteworthy for essentially 4 places. Perhaps they were the most worthy, but I am hard pressed to believe that there wasn't at least one other person as good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't usually give out a second place winner IIRC unless there's really something outstanding but not quite the winner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You already have a indian style culture in WoW, masses of the same type of people breeding like rabbits? Selling wares that dont usually work? Hogging all the oil fields? Blowing shit up because its fun?<br />
