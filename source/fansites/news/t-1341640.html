Vale of Eternal Blossoms - Garrosh Defeat Cutscene<br />
After Garrosh's defeat, there is an extra cutscene in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms.<br />

Patch 5.4 - Visions of Time: Courting Destiny<br />
Patch 5.4 adds a quest line on the Timeless Isle that involves working for Kairoz (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/72870-kairoz) of the Keepers of Time (http://wowpedia.org/Keepers_of_Time). He is on the Timeless Isle because the Bronze Dragonflight is not as powerful as it once was, only being able to catch furtive glimpses through time. He has created an hourglass that will allow for a window into the timeways, but you must collect 50 x Epoch Stones (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/105715-epoch-stone) to make it usable. <br />
<br />
After collecting the stones, you embark on a series of weekly quests to use the Vision of Time (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/105930-vision-of-time) in different locations to calibrate the Vision of Time. Kairoz eventually will reveal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33376-seeking-fate) that there is a traitor among the Bronze Dragonflight.<br />
<br />
As the hourglass grows more powerful, he will send you (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33378-courting-destiny) to the Temple of the White Tiger to see a glimpse of Garrosh and Anduin, which is the scene you see below. <br />

<br />
Oh don't worry there will always be a war, they just know that the Burning Legion is coming back, and I'm pretty sure they'd like to save their world first before trying to kill each other over it. So, yea, it'll stay Warcraft. Lots of obvious foreshadowing in both making peace with the horde ATM, and the &quot;I will end you&quot; line.</div></div><hr />

Tirion just destroyed Frostmourne... the spirits trapped in it are what killed Arthas.<br />

<br />
Very weak move, Blizzard. You had the chance to be in the spotlight again with something awe-inspiring, instead all we get is one-dimensional character stereotypes and platitudes. The coming of a new Warchief is an epic, climactic moment - one of the most important events in recent WoW history. And now it will forever be remembered as a bland disappointment and completely generic story development.<br />
<br />
There would have been so many possibilities! Anything from Blood Elf supremacy to a Forsaken grab for power... but now? To end... like THIS?</div></div><hr />

Yeah!!! Blizzard, why don't you give Orgrimmar to the Alliance and have to re-do all the zones on Durotar just so the people who play Alliance like this guy can feel some kind of sense of pride? <br />

Really, give it a rest with your pride in whatever faction. It's a video game, and Blizzard won't make a TON of work just to make you feel like a the Alliance won a war.<br />

Got a real strong inclination someone from the alliance will do something to piss Vol'jin and the horde. It's just gotta be, why else would Vol'jin even think for a second about following Garrosh's path. Either someone almost completely forgotten from the Alliance's past will stir things up or Jaina herself. It's just gotta be, otherwise; they'll need to change the name to World of Peacecraft and that won't be any fun.<br />

Link to the Horde ending. Thrall and the other Horde leaders throw their support behind Vol'jin. So yeah, he's Warchief alright. <br />
<br />
Being an Alliance player, I really have nothing for or against Vol'jin. Seems like it may be interesting though. <br />
<br />
From the Alliance standpoint, I was quite satisfied. You have to keep in mind that it would be impossible from a gameplay standpoint for the Alliance to do anything more than what was portrayed in the cinematic and what was alluded to in the future in the following quest text from Varian. The King, standing *in fucking Orgrimmar* tells the new Warchief, with the other leaders present that if this shit hits the fan again, they will be utterly destroyed. And not a damn one of them did anything other than stare blankly as he grabbed his sword and left them to rebuild their faction. <br />
<br />
Couple that with the fact that even from a storytelling standpoint, why would the Alliance want Orgrimmar, Thunderbluff, or any of the Kalimdor capitols? What would we do with them, install indoor plumbing? They would be more trouble than they're worth and Varian was absolutely right in saying it would cause too many casualties. He seems to be making the smart play, heading back to Eastern Kingdoms, re-establishing an Alliance presence in Theramore, and focusing on the Horde race that *is* a genuine threat still, and *does* have things that the Alliance wants, The Forsaken. What better than for this new &quot;proactive&quot; Alliance to capitalize on it's current position than to retake Gilnaeas? And no, I don't think for a second we'll &quot;reclaim Lordaeron&quot; so let's not even go there. Gilnaeas is good enough, as it's an expansion of a Horde race at the moment, not one of their capitals. So the Alliance can take it, gameplay balance is unaffected, and the Alliance gets to feel badass for a bit and maybe get some good storytelling especially when you consider Jana seems to have a permanent case of the Mondays.</div></div><hr />

I always wanted to see him shine, brings a tear to me old eye it does. A Warchief I'm proud to serve. Even Sylvanas gave him a little nod of respect haha.<br />

Also, the post-cinematic in Vale does a beautiful job of bookending the whole expansion. And we finally know... what is worth fighting for :)</div></div><hr />

Yeah. Metzan is pretty terrible at personalities. I also don´t get the new anger Thrall has towards the alliance. It was like they decided that becase Jaina has gone hardcore, than now Thrall must also?<br />

The only anger Thrall really showed was at the thought of Garrosh being chained up by the Alliance, and if you think of Thrall's long history, you might realize that the imprisonment of orcs by the Alliance might just be a sore point for him.</div></div><hr />

Give me a break. Blizzard officially spit in the face of half it's play base right there. Not only that, but they went with the most obvious choice for a replacement, thereby giving no one a decent story ending.<br />

Would have been way more fun to end this in a bloodbath with a some leaders killed while they could, then brought back War in World of Warcraft in next expansion.<br />

The entire expansion was about a war and Cataclysm was covered in territorial conquests that took out entire quest hubs for one faction and gave it to another. Don't worry. There's always been war in Warcraft. For Thrall's sake people.</div></div><hr />

Vol'jin is a good choice for warchief, because he is cool but he is also less stable as a choice so there is a good possibility for more horde leadership politics once he has served a while (without it necessarily ending in another revolt). I mainly play Alliance, and the main reason for me why it is so hard to get into that 'Alliance fist pump' is that Varian is just so annoying most of the time. I think it's a combination of his weird model and the script he gets... If literally any other alliance leader had done that part in their way I would have liked it better.

Didn't you see the hate in Vol'jins eyes when he looked up at Varian? Vol'jin hates the alliance as much as any orc. The war will go on, the &quot;uphold honor&quot; crap was just about crossing lines. There are things you don't do, even in war.<br />

Horde gets a wise choice for Warchief, Alliance gets a tough speech and stern warning from their leader.<br />
I'm fine with this in either direction.<br />
<br />
But that is also the problem with it. ---- It is just .... 'fine'.<br />
<br />
It is a decent pick and a nice movie, but really shows no courage at all by Blizzard. I'm not so much against the move, just slightly disappointed they weren't more bold. Let Jaina go off the handle and kill half the room ..... let Thrall smash Garrosh to bits and then exile himself forcing a new warchief to take his place. Have Sylvanas use this opportunity to raise all of the dead in Orgrimar and take a huge offensive. In other words: where's the BOLD ACTION to set up the next expansion? ... ah well ..... for the Horde .....</div></div><hr />

<br />
i was going to say bitch but c word sounded better :/<br />
<br />
Yeah, I completely agree. I'm kind of irritated that she got to him like that and he believed her and stomped over to the horde. 'Oh, you were only assigning a new warchief? well this is awkward... -makes manly speech to recover-'<br />
<br />
Obvious joking aside, I liked both cinematics. Was pretty shocked that Thrall was about to just mace Garrosh's face like it were nothing.</div></div><hr />
