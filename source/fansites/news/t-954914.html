Tier 11 Shoulders and Head for Justice Points<br />
Sometimes raids don't go our way. Sometimes drops don't go our way. I think anyone who has ever farmed for a mount or a particular piece of gear has had a similar experience and, while not getting a drop can be frustrating, one hopes that delayed gratification adds a little savor when you finally do obtain the object of your desire. Good things really do come to those who wait, or at least, exercise persistence and patience.<br />
<br />
I should add that, unlike the olden days, you aren't leaving empty handed from any boss encounter, and you can spend the Valor Points you're obtaining to acquire even more powerful gear.

We Want Your Comics!<br />
We’ve spent 8 years adding awesome community comics to our Comics section (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/media/comics/), but we’re far from finished. We’re looking for the best new World of Warcraft comics to become front page news on our site, and we’d love to have your help, whether you’re a seasoned contributor or a first-time cartoonist. If you’d like to have your comic displayed on our website, submit it here (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/community/comics/).

API - HTML scraping no longer allowed<br />
This is important to anyone who is still scraping the new Armory HTML, as it will break anything that relies on doing so.<br />
Now that the API is live, we want to make you all aware that HTML datamining (via us.battle.net/wow or any of the other regional wow sites) is not acceptable. Within the next 7 days, we will start to blacklist users that are making excessive requests to our regular community sites.<br />
<br />
If you are currently in the process of porting over to the API and have not requested a key yet, please do so. We do not want to interrupt service for community sites that are following that path.<br />
<br />
Unless you're making 1000s of requests a day, its unlikely you'll get caught up in this. This is highly unlikely to apply to blue tracker sites (Assuming they are doing it sensibly), or personal guild sites. <br />

I would actually be pretty surprised if that were true. I'd imagine total population of dwarves and orcs would be pretty similar. Orcs are traditionally (i don't know how cata has changed things) the third most popular horde race, behind Belves and Tauren. And, unless i'm mistaken (quite possible) Alliance has always had relatively even population numbers, excepting gnomes.<br />
<br />
I will say i have noticed a larger number of orcs wandering around in recent months, but that could just be my server.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes raids don't go our way. Sometimes drops don't go our way. I think anyone who has ever farmed for a mount or a particular piece of gear has had a similar experience and, while not getting a drop can be frustrating, one hopes that delayed gratification adds a little savor when you finally do obtain the object of your desire. Good things really do come to those who wait, or at least, exercise persistence and patience.<br />

My guild killed Majordomo and Ragna 5 times and ONLY 1 pala token dropped. Yet the mount manage to drop on our last kill on ragna. Each tier same stuff. Most wanted token (Pala/priest/warlock) which almost all the time are half of raid in guilds are not dropping equaly to others. Gettin sick of tokens for warriors/rogue/dk etc going for offspec when half of raid dont have 4th tier set bonus cause it does not drop. They should drop equally.</div></div><hr />

Blood elves are the most attractive male model in the game by far. They have some quirky animations, and the stigma of being &quot;girly&quot; but when all other male models have ridiculous bodybuilder bodies, the pretty boys with actual normal human bodies reign supreme.</div></div><hr />

Warcraft Realms says otherwise: http://www.warcraftrealms.com/census.php<br />
<br />

I rarely see people playing male ones and always tend to see female ones. Quite surprising. Surprised about the worgen too.

<br />
They look horrible<br />
<br />
Fixed that for you. Alliance has the worst character models, most of the females look like they are butch as hell, especially dwarf and humans. Space goats have the most awkward animations and the tail propping your cloak up as a male looks so dumb, hence why more people play females of that race. Worgen just look dumb and gnomes have proportional issues regardless of gender. No one plays female Taurens on Horde side though, which isn't surprising since they also have stupid looking animations and character design.<br />
<br />
People wonder why there are more Horde players in the world, it's because Horde has better looking characters for the most part.</div></div><hr />

It's not a huge gap between Orcs and Dwarves. Maybe a percent of the overall player population if I remember correctly.<br />

They got the best animations, the best emotes, the best voice acting, the best everything. I suppose the problem must be that the average person just can't take being exposed to that level of awesomeness.</div></div><hr />

Pecentage of people who play Orc/Dwarf male/female =/= more people choose to play female Dwarves than female Orcs. Grats on the promotion.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">denisgsv</div><div class="date">2011-08-10, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">actually there are less female dorfs why ... cos thats the % from the race .... so lets say :there are 1000 orcs and 500 dorfes female orcs are 10% ? then 100 , and female dorfies 13 ? then its 65 ? so the dorf female are still a rarity even if they got bigger percentage .... there are lot more orcs then dorfes .</div></div><hr />

These statistics are interesting but please represent them also in terms of the total number of characters played not just in terms of the characters of the same race. I believe that in actuality there should be less female forsaken than orcs simply because there are huge amounts of orcs.</div></div><hr />

This includes me who plays female as a male consequently. Which sucks cause everything looks so small on them.</div></div><hr />

I noticed that API section on US lately and i love it, tried few things with it and bumped into your post saying you dont want to share it there for some reason. Also /waggle :O</div></div><hr />

The Draenei one doesn't shock me. The Blood Elf one does, as does the Night Elf. I have both a female orc and a female dwarf, heh.<br />
<br />
agree the NE one does to me as well</div></div><hr />

Mostly agreed to be the best looking female designs, plus both races share the same body type and face type. Belf and draenei are just blue and pink reskins of each other.<br />
They... aren't?<br />
<br />
Have you seriously looked at how thin/flat BEves look compared to Draenei?</div></div><hr />

Just for fun I added all the ratio percentages to the number of people who play each race (at level 85 only) from wowCensus:<br />

<br />
with this you can actually compare all the females / males with each other. Female dwarf still loses. by a tiny bit.</div></div><hr />

Really now? You make that bold of a statement and then even have the courage to question the sample size of the OP? Troll harder please. I'm genuinely surprised when I see male Blood Elves, Draenei, or Night elves, and I see them rarely. Therefore from my experience this data does not accurately reflect my in-game experience. This is my opinion, not a fact. Other people are obviously going to have a different in-game experience but from my point of view I have serious doubts about the sample size and how well female characters and female players were represented in this poll.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I'm definatley not compaining here as a male Draenei player! XD<br />
<br />
At least our race won't die out due to a shortage of females :3 (Payback's a bitch, isn't it Orcs? :D)</div></div><hr />
