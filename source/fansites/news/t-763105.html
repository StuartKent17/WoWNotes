If you've been playing WoW for a while, you probably got stuck in ghost form one day because you died in a strange location and spent countless hours looking FOR THAT DAMN GRAVEYARD TO SPIRIT REZ.

Hunter Pet Skills Update<br />
Hunters already got a lot of utility pet skills in Build 12942 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1965-Hunter-DK-Pet-Changes-Archaeology-Blue-Posts) but the latest beta build added a few more that I forgot to mention.<br />

Hillsbrad / Alterac Mountains in Cataclysm - Updated Screenshots<br />
Blizzard finished updating most of the world zones and I'm currently working on a huge update of all the zones pages, for the moment here is a nice set of screenshot of the new Hillsbrad Foothills. <br />
<br />
The Horde defeated the Alliance there and controls most of the zone, the remaining Stormpikes had to retreat in the mountains. Also, the Alterac Mountains zone is &quot;gone&quot; and has been merged with Hillsbrad. <br />

Beta - Heroic Dungeons Now Available<br />
Heroics are now available.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the Pre-made Character Templates should provide you guys with characters in level 333 Superior (blue) quality gear - which is the minimum expected gear level for succeeding in heroics. I strongly encourage you to copy over a new pre-made if you want to test heroics.<br />
<br />
Available character copies should also be reset.<br />
<br />
*We're looking in to the issue of not being able to use dungeon finder. You should be able to form up a group the old-fashioned way and walk into a heroic. <br />
<br />
[...] Here's a quick list for easy access to active threads on both dungeons and raids. We will be sure to update it whenever something new is available. <br />

Gear scaling in Cataclysm<br />
You're too focused on hit alone.<br />
<br />
This piece of gear wouldn't exist, but to save me from having to make three versions, consider this series of boots:<br />
<br />
Level 83 quest blues with 10 attack power, 10 Stamina, 10 crit, 10 hit, 10 parry.<br />
Level 85 quest blues with 12 attack power, 12 Stamina, 12 crit, 12 hit, 12 parry.<br />
Level 85 tier 1 raid with 14 attack power, 14 Stamina, 14 crit, 14 hit, 14 parry.<br />
Level 85 tier 2 raid with 16 attack power, 16 Stamina, 16 crit, 16 hit, 16 parry.<br />
<br />
When yo go from level 83 to level 85 you stay at the same amount of power relative to creatures. Why? Because the creatures are gaining levels. Their health goes up, so you need that extra AP. Their damage goes up, so you need that extra health. Your chance to crit and hit and parry them goes down, so you need those stats as well.<br />
<br />
So far, so good.<br />
<br />
When you start raiding, the bosses are level 88. This makes them a little harder to hit and everything, so you need that extra budget on your gear to keep up. Still not a problem.<br />
<br />
Now let's look at the final piece of gear. You're going from a tier 1 raid to a tier 2 raid. The boss hits harder so you need that health. The boss has more health, so you need that attack power. But the boss is still level 88 like he was in tier 1. This means you crit him more than the previous boss, because your crit went up. You do more damage to the harder boss than to the easier boss. You also hit him more (unless you're hit capped, which you probably are) and you parry him more.<br />
<br />
We solved, in an awkward way, the parry problem in Icecrown by putting a debuff on you. That basically allowed the creatures to scale with your gear. We couldn't solve the crit or hit problems, so players just became more and more powerful and eventually capped those stats (or got close to it in the case of crit). Just as players are often very worried (and sometimes rightfully so) about not scaling with gear, the bosses were not scaling with your gear. All of those problems that can happen to players when their damage (or healing or tanking) don't scale were happening to the bosses. You were scaling too well with crit, hit and parry.<br />
<br />
A different way to go would be that the tier 2 raid boss is actually level 89 or 90 instead of level 88. Then you'd naturally need more crit and hit and parry to face him. That makes intuitive sense, but it does some weird things to our game because creature levels were never intended to be used that way. For example, the boss would get crushing blows and resists. Even worse, it does weird things to the next tier of content. If Deathwing at the end of Cataclysm (spoiler!) is a level 93 boss, then what is the first boss at the end of the next expansion? Level 93? Level 90? Level 96?<br />
<br />
Instead, we are just faking the bosses gaining levels. We haven't worked out the exact mechanic yet, but imagine they are level 88++ or level 88.3 or level 88 SKULL SKULL BAD SKULL. As you get more powerful and get better gear, they get more powerful... exactly like all those bosses you handled while leveling up. Rather than critting and hitting the more dangerous opponents more often, your relative power stays about the same. You scale. <br />

Beta Testing<br />
Heroics not Enabled?<br />
We're doublechecking to make sure the hotfix that unlocked the heroics was applied to each PTR. As a separate note, if you are not eligible to enter into a Heroic (ie You are less than level 85) then the error message will still say the instance is disable for beta. That incorrect error will be corrected in a future client build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850268403/heroics-not-enabled-on-gilneas/))<br />

Tol Barad<br />
Daily Quests<br />

There are 6 random dailies available on the peninsula island every day. These are available at all times, regardless of who wins Tol Barad. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26723613120/bugs-tol-barad/))<br />

Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Average ilvl in Dungeon Finder<br />
Our average ilevel is there primarily because Dungeon Finder restricts usage and we didn't think it was fair to say &quot;You must be this high to ride the ride&quot; without defining &quot;this.&quot; It's there to stop a fresh 85 who has no idea that's he's doing something terribly wrong by queuing right away for heroic Grim Batol. I would not use our ilevel as much of a serious metric. It's very easy to game by sophisticated players.

Early Cataclysm instances difficulty<br />
So what do we do when we need to AE tank and do not have Inquisition? <br />
You do what level 15 warrior tanks do who don't have Sunder Armor yet. You make do.<br />
<br />
We don't spend a great deal of effort balancing the dungeons at levels below max level. We compensate for that by making them pretty easy. You didn't see a lot of tanks posting about how hard Utgarde Keep was at 70 or how hard Hellfire Ramparts was at 60 and I doubt you'll see many paladins complaining about how hard tanking is when they are 82 or whatever.<br />
<br />
The level 85 dungeons and to a greater extent the heroics and raids are more tightly balanced because we want them to be more challenging.<br />
<br />
If you're having trouble on the PTR with level up dungeons, it's probably because the content isn't finished yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859118390/paladin-tanking-video-thoughts-concerns-etc/))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
AE Tanking<br />
It's also highly possible that the abilities just aren't tuned right yet. If you have a reasonable idea how to tank and are feeling that AE tanking is nail-bitingly difficult to generate enough threat, then it's probably just undertuned. We want tanks to have to actually push their buttons and not just autoattack their way to high threat, but it shouldn't be so tight that a hot tick risks pulling aggro.<br />
<br />
We recently consolidated a lot of janky threat mods that were on a lot of different abilities into core abilities like Righteous Fury and Defensive Stance. For example, warriors used to have a threat reduction modifier on Battle and Berseker Stance. We took that away and increased Defensive Stance's threat to compensate. You may be seeing data from in the midst of all of those changes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859118390/paladin-tanking-video-thoughts-concerns-etc/))<br />
<br />
[...] I used Defensive Stance as an example. We buffed the threat of Defensive Stance, Righteous Fury, Bear Form and Blood Presence and tried to get rid of any invisible -threat modifiers on other things. It's easier to tune and avoid bugs (in this case) if it's just one number and not scattered eight places in the data. As just one example, when we removed Blessing of Salvation (for LK) we added a separate, invisible spell effect that applied that buff just in case we changed our minds for any reason. Now that Salv as a 100% uptime blessing is long gone, we just added it to the tanking stances.<br />
<br />
Sorry for any confusion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850278218/um-please-don-t-actually-do-this/))<br />

Getting more powerful over time<br />
That goes straight to customer satisfaction and longevity of the game. The more you play, the more powerful you should become. Not the weaker. <br />
You do get more powerful. You get more powerful in an absolute sense, but not in a relative sense, because the challenges you can face become more powerful too. It is a fundamental pillar of RPG design othat as you get more powerful, you are able to handle more powerful opponents. Games lose their steam pretty quickly if you become more powerful and just use that power to steamroll the same weak opponents. Where is the glory in that? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850257725/the-problem-with-hit-scaling-in-raid-tiers/))<br />
<br />
Hit rating<br />
Hit will never be an interesting stat as long as there's a hard cap on it.<br />
I know this is an old argument, but this is *why* we think hit is an interesting stat. If you could just stack hit forever, you probably would, because it's a very good stat. Some of the biggest decisions to be made about gearing come when you have to engineer enough but not too much of this one stat so that you can focus on the others. We want you to look at stats other than just ilevel. Otherwise, we might as well just give all the armor and weapons a power stat, and you just pick whichever has the most power. Hit keeps you from just stacking your best stat. Maybe it doesn't add a ton of depth to say &quot;stack hit, then stack your best stat&quot; but it does add some.

Optimizing talent builds<br />
I appreciate all the work the OP put into that post, but you have to look at your definition of &quot;mandatory.&quot; You're taking several talents with no +damage benefit and calling them dps talents because they may lead to higher dps. But under that argument even +health talents are dps because you're likely to do higher dps when you're alive.<br />
<br />
My personal philosophy, as I have expressed before, is that the community tends to be over-obsessed with cookie cutter builds. It's somewhat understandable because the WoW community has evolved in a direction where being badly informed is worse than being a bad player. We're all very quick to judge each other based on litmus tests, such as gear scores, achievements, or proper talent builds, that likely don't measure performance half as well as we want them to.<br />
<br />
Even many of the so called cookie cutter builds today are honest about those talents that are a toss up. Picking talent A over talent B may be a theoretical dps benefit in the sims or even for the author of the cookie cutter build, but that doesn't mean it will work for you. I have deviated from these sacred builds often on my own characters because I found that I don't rely on certain abilities or mechanics as much as the build assumes I should. Now maybe my dps (healing, etc.) would improve if I could manage to do that, but in the interim using a build that is bad for me just because it's the anointed one doesn't make sense. A- dps with the &quot;bad&quot; build is superior to C+ dps with the &quot;good&quot; build.<br />
<br />
If it's a talent that provides a 10% dps increase or offers an ability you'll use constantly, fine. It's hard to argue that won't benefit most players. But when I see players obsess over talents that provide a theoretical 1% dps increase that is vastly overshadowed by the noise of their own performance, I shake my head a bit. Want to see what I mean? Compare a parse of yours on the same boss from week to week. You'll probably see a dps variance of 5-10% or more. That's the role of your skill, latency, bad luck, lacking the perfect raid comp or whatever else. Worrying about that 1% dps talent was a rounding error. Let's not forget that what may be 1% on one boss probably is not on another.<br />
<br />
Finally, getting back to a &quot;mandatory&quot; talent, consider what you'd call a talent that wasn't mandatory. You'd probably call it junk, the way many of you dismiss the &quot;PvP talents.&quot; If a talent is useful, then it becomes mandatory. If it's not useful, it's dismissed. That narrow sweet spot in the middle where a talent is truly optional is held to be very, very narrow indeed by many in the community.<br />
<br />
The Devs may be correct, in theory, that we don't need to squeeze every last drop of DPS out of our talent trees to down bosses. But in practice, you try to get in a raid with a tree that sacraficed 1% DPS for some fun utility, and you don't get an invite. Why would the raid leader take someone that didn't even spec the &quot;right way&quot;? <br />
Posts like this make me very sad. You're portraying yourself to be at the mercy of uninformed yet tyrannical raid leaders who are quick to judge your performance based on perceived &quot;tells.&quot; I know you need some basis to evaluate potential recruits or even pug members. But I do wish there was some way to turn around this virtual phobia of inefficiency -- this terror of being WRONG -- that we have managed to instill in our player base. I honestly think it's one of the greatest challenges facing the game. <br />
<br />
I agree with a lot of what you're saying GC, but I gotta disagree with one thing you said. It is true that if you look back at parses from previous weeks your dps may vary by as much as 5-10% based on skill, luck, latency etc. However, you can't say that because of that fact, a theoretical 1% dps increase is any less significant than it would have been. <br />
I'm just saying it's not worth it. How many attempts can you name in your lifetime as a WoW player where your doing 1% more dps would have made the difference between success and failure? And how many of those attempts could you have gotten 10% more dps if you had just totally nailed your rotations etc. on those fights instead of worrying about a theoretical 1% dps gain from a different talent?<br />
<br />
Every bit helps, totally. I'm not saying throw a dart board at talent trees and expect to be competitive. But at times it's a bit like stooping down to pick up pennies in the gutter because you're about to plunk down six figures on a house. Hey, that's one-one hundredth less dollar I have to pay. :)<br />
<br />
On a stationary fight, those movement boosts are useless. On a fight where you can't AE, those area damages are useless. If you have enough mana, then you have enough mana. Yes, I can understand the argument that it might be convenient to pick all of that stuff up because it might be useful on some fight, but if you're hardcore enough to pick up a talent because you read it was a 1% dps increase, then you should be hardcore enough to know for which fights it applies to and perhaps even be willing to swap specs accordingly. There are players that swap out a lot of glyphs in between fights or even re-gem. Some cutting edge guilds respec for every boss when they're working on progression. They probably coax a 1% dps increase out of doing so. Does that mean you should?<br />
<br />
Min-maxxing is fun. It's part of the game. Sometimes (more rarely than is claimed) it's even necessary for progression. Just keep it in perspective. It's probably not going to doom your attempt if you pick up a fun talent instead of a 1% dps increase. If the Saturday pug won't take you because you lack the anointed talent, you're probably better off not running with them.<br />
<br />
Interestingly, the community seems to have adopted 1% dps as the trade-off they're willing to make. You don't often see posts or guides advocating a gem or talent because it provides a 0.3% dps increase. There is something magical about 1% for a lot of players. <br />
<br />
Hey GC, was wondering if we could maybe drag you back to this thread again to focus a little on the first part of Slant's post. The part I quoted pretty much sums up how I feel right now, and I know a few others who feel the same. Sometimes it seems like Cata is right around the corner and there's just not enough time for everything to happen. <br />
We see this every expansion. Some players start to freak out because their list of demands hasn't been met yet and they sense release is imminent. Then the expansion ships and everyone is focused on some other overpowered ability that was only a blip on the beta radar.<br />
<br />
It's inappropriate for me to provide any hints about how close we are or are not to ship. We need to provide that information through certain channels. We're happy with the talent trees given the confines of the talent system. If we were making WoW 2.0 (which we're not), the talent panes might look very different. Perhaps there would be even fewer choices and all centered around utility. Increasingly I think exclusive choices (like Starcraft's campaign upgrade system, or the way Paths of the Titans was going to work) is the only way to make interesting choices without cherry picking. On the other hand, one thing we've definitely learned through this process is that (most) players want a certain amount of safe choice. Maybe that gets back to the whole &quot;terror of being caught being wrong&quot; problem, or maybe the game's just too complicated. We talked about an even more radical overhaul where choosing a spec was a bigger deal and you had maybe 3 talents after that, but ultimately we understood the risk of changing too much a game that some players have stuck with for over 5 years.

Talents prereq<br />
What we do sometimes is say stick Repentance as a prereq for something you desperately need. The hope is we can count on paladins (in this example) having the crowd control, and the player can pick up the talent guilt free. And yet, we see a lot of complaints about the prereqs. &quot;Why do I have to get that talent that doesn't benefit my dps?&quot; If there aren't enough core dps talents, some players get agitated (and I'm not trying to dismiss that response as inappropriate). But that leaves less room for the utility ones.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to say we're unhappy with the talent trees. By and large, we're very happy with how they are shaping up. I'm just trying to explain some of our reasoning and why some of the alternate talent trees we see pitched are not tenable from our perspective.

Frostfire in Cataclysm<br />
The intent is that for fire mages that emphasize the mastery stat, frostfire bolt with glyph becomes a better option than fireball with glyph (and yes it's a temporary aberration that scorch is better than fireball).

Judgements of the Pure<br />
Judgement of the Pure lasts for 60 sec and Judgement has an 8 sec cooldown. Even if you missed a couple times in a row, it would seem like you would have ample opportunity to still get the buff up (and even if the buff falls down, your healing doesn't totally collapse). Judgement costs 5% of mana, so it's hard to imagine that's a huge mana loss if you miss.<br />
<br />
I would consider that +hit as optional for PvP, soloing or when you just want to burn things up in a 5-player run. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850276521/state-of-holy-paladins-build-12984/))<br />

Oh yeah, thanks Blizz, rub more salt in the wounds of the worgen. &quot;Hey, isn't this goblin mount AWESOME. Mounts are just AWESOME aren't they? Especially NEW mounts. Mounts you can just sit back on and tear up the turf with! I bet you can't wait for all the NEW AWESOME MOUNTS in Cataclysm!&quot;<br />
<br />
What are you complaining about? As a Worgen, you can still use all those other mounts in the game! And to be honest, running on all fours is unique to Worgen, so it's actually more awesome than riding one of the hundreds of other mounts in the game!<br />
<br />
Also, think about it this way: you choose to run on all fours, or you can ride horse, or an Elekk, or a nightsaber, etc etc... but those humans, Draenei and Night Elfs, they cannot run on your feet!!<br />
<br />
So if you're not a Worgen, I can imagine you're pissed: I mean, Worgen get something new (running on all fours), all horde get something new (Goblin mounts), but the other members of the alliance actually do not get something new.<br />
<br />
In short: all people who whine that Worgen are missing out on something because they are not getting a mount, are out of their freaking mind!!!!</div></div><hr />

Light-hearted for Horde, at least.<br />

Also, I'm kinda shocked that the Dalaran NPCs are still Horde-hostile. You would think that after all the Sunreavers did to even allow Horde to set foot inside Dalaran itself and the Kirin'Tor's neutral stance towards the two factions have been in the last few years that the Forsaken would... yanno... stop killing them.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I don't like boars either, which is why I advocated having a different mount rather than no mount at all. Giving up a racial mount entirely just so I didn't have to have a boar as a racial mount doesn't seem that great of a trade to me.</div></div><hr />

Think about it this way: as worgen we've had our mounts showing up in every single worgen image.<br />

Anyway, tried the new AOE for chimera pets yesterday, felt a bit wonky to use, not entirely sure -how- it's supposed to work. Wether I need to target a mob before using it or not. I did notice it seemed to share a Mind Sear animation, and ticked for fair damage. Since it has to channel the spell, it's alright. :)<br />
I do hope they fix the annoying bug with pets in the next build, where pets that re-appear after you dismount only have like 5% health on them, and can get twoshot if you forgot about that. =_=</div></div><hr />

Accidentally fall off of a cliff in a zone where you don't have a flying spirit, and you'll understand why this feature rocks! I remember many times going straight forward to my corpse but there was some huge ravine in the way, and it took me ages to run around some cliff.

Beta Testing<br />
My personal philosophy, as I have expressed before, is that the community tends to be over-obsessed with cookie cutter builds. It's somewhat understandable because the WoW community has evolved in a direction where being badly informed is worse than being a bad player. We're all very quick to judge each other based on litmus tests, such as gear scores, achievements, or proper talent builds, that likely don't measure performance half as well as we want them to.<br />
<br />
The Devs may be correct, in theory, that we don't need to squeeze every last drop of DPS out of our talent trees to down bosses. But in practice, you try to get in a raid with a tree that sacraficed 1% DPS for some fun utility, and you don't get an invite. Why would the raid leader take someone that didn't even spec the &quot;right way&quot;? <br />
Posts like this make me very sad. You're portraying yourself to be at the mercy of uninformed yet tyrannical raid leaders who are quick to judge your performance based on perceived &quot;tells.&quot; I know you need some basis to evaluate potential recruits or even pug members. But I do wish there was some way to turn around this virtual phobia of inefficiency -- this terror of being WRONG -- that we have managed to instill in our player base. I honestly think it's one of the greatest challenges facing the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are a number of huge underlying problems that Blizzard is not adressing at all imo. Blizz is making the game more and more complex and that will be it's downfall. I have played since early Vanilla and have seen the amount of buttons on my bars grow immensly, seen the stats explode, seen the abilities grow wild, etc. etc. To some extend, that is a very good thing because you want to feel like making progress and learning new stuff while leveling. But what I've seen for Cata is going to be insane, I cannot possibly keybind all the stuff I want to use, if I even have the time to decide upon which button I should use in a given situation. Also, what I quoted above, this is the biggest issue. Achievements and ilvl addons and cookie cutter specs will still be part of the game, that's just the way it is. Everyone will copy their specs from the most progressed guilds on the server or just theorycraft on EJ and such, there will always be a 'best'spec'. And there will always be ppl that have to sign themselves over to these kind of raidleaders because they just lack the skill to lead one themselves, don't have complete overview of a fight, don't grasp mechanics of all the other classes and roles, etc. etc. <br />
<br />
Imho blizz should get rid of achievements, ilvl addons and stuff like that in stead of creating the asshole raidleaders we all run in to, even in guilds, perhaps especially in high end guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is looking more and more likely that the Cata dungeons, while awesome looking, are going to be nothing more than Wrath snore fests once again and all his talk about returning to the TBC progression model is a bunch of crap.<br />
<br />
TB stated the one prior challenging regular instance has reportedly been nerfed and that this level 85 regular instance is about as challenging and interesting (aside from the looks) as wet toast.<br />
<br />
I know I'll be flamed for this with such great lines as this is only beta etc, etc but it appears a combination of a lack of design imagination (possibly from trying to rush Cata to market for the holiday season) and beta QQ have already worked their magic.<br />
<br />

If you haven't figured it out already, he has an incredible ego. Listening to his videos it became quite evident he believes he is a cut above most players, if not some of the better raiding guilds.

Judgements of the Pure<br />
Judgement of the Pure lasts for 60 sec and Judgement has an 8 sec cooldown. Even if you missed a couple times in a row, it would seem like you would have ample opportunity to still get the buff up (and even if the buff falls down, your healing doesn't totally collapse). Judgement costs 5% of mana, so it's hard to imagine that's a huge mana loss if you miss.<br />
<br />
I would consider that +hit as optional for PvP, soloing or when you just want to burn things up in a 5-player run.<br />
<br />
Does that mean he considers it required for raiding? I can see that, my judgements would hardly ever hit bosses with 0 hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the +hit argument is contradictory to everything they said about shuffling stats around and removing annoying rating calculations (defense, etc), hit was supposed to go the dodo way but for some odd reason they're keeping that one. I understand that they need to have us worry about more than a single stat (otherwise DPS would just stack strength/agility and call it a day, etc), but they aren't selling the whole philosophy behind it very well.</div></div><hr />

In all fairness, I love the worgen idea of running on all fours, makes it more &quot;realistic&quot; if you will. However alliance race do get ONE new thing. Draenai finally get there own paladin Elekks ( Nothing new on the model front I guess but you see what I am saying )<br />

Also I am happy that cats got some love, whilst I wont be bringing my cat alot of the time to raids - due to the fact that its highly possible with my guild they will need the buff from a pet, it is awesome to see that the pet I first tamed back years ago has some uses.

It returns your spirit back to the GY, not your body, for those occasions as already mentioned where you were not able to find your body because you got lost somehow.<br />
<br />
Running from somewhere on old kingdoms to Northrend doesn't really take very long. Maybe ten minutes or so depending on time spent waiting for a boat. I did it several times with new level one characters, dieing in or near a starting area and ghost running to Dalaran to resurrect; which is no longer possible with the recent PTR patch.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I remember auto-walking in Tanaris while getting myself something to drink. Found myself dead somewhere between Tanaris/ Un'goro. Walked all the way back, but I jumped too far and missed my corpse (seemed to be unreachable) -.-'. So I had to walk all the way back from Un'goro to Tanaris and decided just to take res sickness.

On the PTR I died in Icecrown. Due to a bug I didn't get a ghost mount. While trying to get back to my corpse I fell off the cliff. I was unable to get back to my corpse and then walking back to the graveyard wasn't possible. However in the help menus I did find this feature to teleport me back to the graveyard. It looks like now that is in a more obvious place in case you need to use it. <br />

It is no challenge whatsoever of being slightly better than the statistical average. Being in such status, you are better than 50% of the playerbase by default. Very basic mathematics here, even I can wrap my silly head around the fact. So... when someone describes himself as being &quot;above average&quot; simply by looking at the statistics, guess what? That someone is indeed better than most.<br />

I can't tell you the number of times wipes are at 1% or your trying to push into the next phase and miss it by 1%. It's like the entire game is designed around 1%.

The idea its that if you are missing certain buffs or debuffs you can bring another pet to get it. Since all pets will be doing around same damage now there is more flexibility than in WotLK with only wolf dedicated raid pet.</div></div><hr />

Did you fail to notice that the hunter will have the ability to bring ALL the buffs based on the pet they pick? This in no way is singling out Shaman. The only thing this is doing is allowing a hunter to bring a missing buff to a raid. This in combination with the buff changes in Cataclysm will help the 10 mans get the majority of the buffs.<br />
<br />
My only problem with this system is pet leveling. On the PTR the closest a low level pet will be the hunter is 3 levels. If a hunter is expected to have the option to bring all these pets to a raid based on the composition it is silly that they would need to level all of these pets to max level. Otherwise the hunter is going to lose a little bit of DPS (or a lot if BM).</div></div><hr />

Cat its not the new wolf since the buff its the same that DKs and Shamans already bring. There is not a new wolf, instead you can choose your pet based on the buffs/AOE your group is missing, cause all pets should do about same damage. Also currently rhino attacks from behind so the knockback seems more like a knockforward. QQ<br />
<br />
Also put your back to the wall if you dont want to be knocked. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read his entire post and all it accomplished was the underlying statement that players are the problem and not the system. I say, bullshit.<br />
<br />
The players ARE the problem, and just because you COMPLETELY missed the entire point he was trying to make, doesn't make it BS.<br />
<br />
1% Boss/Mob health != 1% DPS. <br />
<br />
Or if you want real numbers, <br />
<br />
Heroic LK = 100M HP<br />
1% = 1M HP<br />
<br />
Very Good DPS=15-20k DPS<br />
+1% DPS = +150-200 DPS<br />
<br />
Over the course of a 15 minute fight, assuming you go all the way to the enrage timer, you are talking about 135-180k more total damage. Or roughly .1% of HM LK's HP.<br />
<br />
How many wipes have you experienced where the boss resets at &lt;200k hp out of 10s of millions, where everyone played perfectly but still wiped? IF you wiped at that point, there are probably a vast number of more significant problems that should be addressed, and will do MUCH more good if corrected, then the fact that the warlock in your group didn't take the perfect cookie-cutter spec. <br />
<br />
The system isn't designed around a 1% difference either way. Players have created that false illusion, which is what GC was getting at. His point was that people will scream that, because someone missed out on a statistically insignificant DPS increase, obviously they must be bad.</div></div><hr />

If you want 10/25 mans to get majority of buffs so easily why not just make a &quot;cataclysm raid aura&quot; to give everyone every buff? The buffs have always been divided among the existing classes. To have a class that can fill the role of any missing buff can cause raids to be 9man+a hunter composed. That can even be made to dungeons so that 5mans have all the existing buffs/debuffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You fail at teh maths! Try to pay more attention next time.<br />
<br />
1: The reason you &quot;can't tell you the number of times wipes are at 1%&quot; is because it sticks out in your mind. It is memorable. It stands out. If you actually counted it up it would be negligible. Maybe a half dozen times in your entire WoW experience.<br />
<br />
2: In almost every DPS tree there are always a couple of &quot;monster&quot; talents that boost DPS by 10%-20% (think mage ignite,any of the .5s or 1s cast time reduction talents, enh shaman dual wield, etc.) The 1% talents are what people who did pay attention in math class call &quot;insignificant&quot;. You will lose more DPS because the kid down the street is downloading porn than you will with the 1% talent. Now if you skip all of the 1% talents yeah, you will suck. But you pretty much have to go out of your way to be stupid to do that.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: You can't skip all the 1% DPS talents. You can skip 1 or 2.</div></div><hr />

Eh. They have. Mages have a version of Bloodlust/Heroism now too. All the buffs are more widely spread, and one of the ways they are doing it is to have Hunter pets bring a lot of them (but not at once, they're fill ins. A hunter can't bring multiple buffs, only the one their current pet brings). Not the only way mind, one of the ways. The point is not to make it so you don't have to think about raid comp at all, but rather to make more raid comps viable.</div></div><hr />

I still remember the one time where a guildie died on an Icecrown cliff that extended a bit into Scholazar Basin and he ended up in SB at the bottom of said cliff with no spirit healer nearby. I ended up needing to fly out of Dalaran and look around for a few minutes for his corpse. (After resurrecting him, I asked how he died. Apparently he liked to reach the ground more quickly by shifting out of flight form, but he didn't switch back into it fast enough before the ground embraced him.)<br />
<br />
I'm also happy to see that Blizzard is giving Beast Mastery some love for the next expansion, as the 51-point talent for WotLK is nothing but a vanity talent. Great job putting in some useful utility. :)<br />

The only real complaint I have in this news post is with TotalBiscuit's commentary for his Halls of Origination video. I didn't appreciate his condescension towards associating the &quot;unchallenging&quot; content with the average player, as if 95% of the populace are mouth-breathers. It seems to me there's this attitude starting to arise from him (and in general) of either being &quot;hardcore&quot; (whatever it is the definition may be) or you are a loser with nothing to really contribute -- you are just a warm body and you are holding the cream of the crop back because you somehow take away their fun.<br />
<br />
Here's a newsflash, TB: Yes, there is room for improvement, but you also need to remember that it is a regular 5-man instance and not the heroic version, let alone a raid. You even have the bonus of running these instances with players whose playing styles you are familiar with. Just wait until Cataclysm goes live, when the &quot;average&quot; player will most likely be pugging those dungeons. (I still remember back in WotLK's early days, where the escort event in H HoS was bloody murder. In H Gundrak it was highly preferred that you take a hunter to spring Frost Trap on Slad'rans adds. For H Oculus, it was good to have a paladin or bear tank.)</div></div><hr />

You can blame it on a number of variables that caused a wipe. Missed rotations and what not. Movement fights vs standing still. However, having a constant 1% DPS is still a constant and it comes off the bottom line. Unlike a variables he mention that may or may not come into play.<br />
<br />
Hell, How many times have you got a large crit on a mob and it's health pool lands at, Guess WHAT? 1% health and he does not die. The entire game seems to be based off a 1% margin. Why wouldn't players be high concerned? We're constantly smacked in the face with it.<br />
<br />
I read his entire post and all it accomplished was the underlying statement that players are the problem and not the system. I say, bullshit.<br />
<br />
You do realize he was talking about a theoretical 1% dps increase, like if the stars allign for that particular talent. That's not constant at all. And not something to pound your head on the desk about. And this is exactly why players are the problem. <br />
<br />
And saying some one is a windbag and then rambling about some crazy 1% conspiracy in the game is hilariously ironic to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over the course of a 15 minute fight, assuming you go all the way to the enrage timer, you are talking about 135-180k more total damage. Or roughly .1% of HM LK's HP.<br />
<br />
If you had 16 DPS in a 25 man raid group hitting ust 1% extra, it changes the numbers drastically (Many times there are 2-3 talents that provide 1%). Your hypothetical 135K-180K now becomes 2,160,000 - 2,880,00 est. Thats significant DPS even when looking at a 100 million health pool. I've seen many Heroic PP fights end with roughly that much health left and it results in a wipe. <br />
<br />
All the little 1% add up from every player and missing out on them is a mistake. To say it's a &quot;statistically insignificant DPS increase&quot; is a fallacy. When dealing with millions of hit points. (baring that person knows how to play in the overall scheme of things - priority, raid awareness and such).<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR: You can't skip all the 1% DPS talents. You can skip 1 or 2. <br />
<br />
Thats very true to some extent but just how many raiders in a group can you take and miss out of all those 1% increases? If all toons had 4 talents of 1% and you had 10 people miss half of them is it worth having a raid miss out on that increased DPS? I can't see how it would be a good thing for the benefit of raiding. You need those talents.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
There are some talents that are direct increases and not so theoretical. I don't think it does a raid group any good to skip the DPS increase talents even if they are 1%. Were not talking about increased stamina talent, making you live longer so you have more DPS time. Thats theoretical. There talking about dropping those stray points into talents that offer a direct DPS increase. You can't just bypass them cause you want to take a talent thats for pvp or just for flavor. To many raiders do that in a raid group and suddenly your down a significant amount of damage.</div></div><hr />

16 DPS raiders x 10k = 160,000 raid DPS. If you had 10 people skip 2 1% talents each you wind up at... 158,000 raid DPS.<br />
<br />
Which brings us to the point GC is trying to make: that is well within the range of uncertainty, noise. A single raider with a wonky connection will lose more than that. If two of your raiders didn't sleep well, if the warlocks started smoking weed earlier than usual tonight. The RNG causes more swings than this. You can get more DPS by buying a new video card.<br />
<br />
Which is exactly GCs point. Kicking someone out of your raid because of one talent point here or there is overdoing it.<br />
<br />
Where he is sort of wrong, or why he doesn't understand why this is happening is two fold: 1) that's usually the only criteria you have to judge a total stranger on. I doubt that if a friend of a PUG raid leader said &quot;Get this dude, he knows what he's doing&quot; said PUG leader would kick him for a gem choice. We overblow the importance of cookie cutter builds and gemming because that's the only information we usually have. and 2) often times you have to be a total bonehead to get them wrong. Not always, some times talents are a toss up. But sometimes they are very clearly pvp, pve, or useless, and it doesn't take a sim to reach that conclusion. So it's not that the talent is more or less than 1%. Its that you have to be an idiot to take whatever you took instead.</div></div><hr />

Agree. How else are you expected to judge someone by it? A pug, in general, stops being a pug when you already know everyone in it, so every pug is a risk. Add the future achievements for sticking with guild members, and the combat changes, to Dungeon Finder and it's not too surprising to not know someone in a pug, or the chance of getting a baddie going up. Kicking weaker links after already starting can make more people quit because they don't want to wait any longer. Add some other way to check or some incentive to taking that risk with a pug (perky pug continuation) and there might be more people willing to pug or stick around. That isn't even getting into the fact that some people might suck but get better with practice given the opportunity, but again, no incentive to carrying them til they get better if you're never going to see them again and they might cause a wipe.</div></div><hr />

Why dont they just make all talents baseline and get rid of talent trees?<br />

I'm counting...like...five Forsaken settlements/outposts and literally no Alliance towns. Eastpoint Tower...which sounds like it could be an alli outpost, is populated by a couple orcs and their forsaken therapist, Southshore is a plague-ridden ghost town, and Dun Garok is filled with ghosts. The only thing close to an Alliance presence in Hillsbrad I can see is the Strompike Guard and they're just there to serve as glorified whack-a-moles for leveling hordies. <br />
<br />
So...yea...wtf. Please tell me we get Strahnbrad or something...</div></div><hr />
