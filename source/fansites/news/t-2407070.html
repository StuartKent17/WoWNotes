Thats a 4% nerf, not a 40% nerf.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, that's not correct. If your baseline passive was 25 and it got nerfed to 18% (as it did), the difference is actually greater than 16%. It is defined as:<br />
<br />
((ORIGINAL - NEW) / ORIGINAL) = DELTA<br />
<br />
((25 - 18)/25) = 0.28. In this case, it was a 28% nerf.<br />

- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes. It is a flat passive. They're doing this to ensure that they don't change a spec's rotation/priority (which tuning individual abilities can do).<br />
<br />
Yes it's a 10% nerf of the 40% nerf that already exists, but from the start of beta enh has been nerfed 44%, rather than 40%.<br />
<br />
The way you explain it makes it overly confusing, enh has been nerfed 44% over the course of beta, the dmg of their skills has been nerfed an additional 4% from where it originally was.</div></div><hr />

how much testing can be done with raid-quality gear right now?<br />
<br />
speccs that shine with certain stat caps won't show how good they are or how rotations change at higher stat values (mostly haste).<br />

in the past, fury warrior was often behind arms at the start of the expac, while they were on top at the end most of the time compared to arms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no, im refering to enhance shaman.<br />
<br />
They were at -40% damage (effectively 60% damage) now they are at -44% damage (effectively 56% damage). if you do the new damage (56%) over the old damage (60%) you see that they are dealing 93.33% of the damage they were dealing before. 100% minus 93.33% shows you that its a 6.66% damage nerf.</div></div><hr />

Yesterday, while playing Fury, I was actually thinking &quot;This is a little too overpowered. It will definitely get nerfed&quot;. I just didn't expect it to come this fast.

The survival hunter changes, and combined with the shaman changes, this dev team needs to go. They have no idea what is fun and what is not. BFA looks a lot like Legion, that looked a lot like WoD. Each with 1 big different feature. <br />

I've played BM since BC in raids (not every raid of every xpack but you see the picture), it has always been &quot;viable&quot;, just not the top spec of the 3. Anyway I dont care if I make 3% less dps than another spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pyro wouldn't be worth hardcasting if it only did 250 or 300% of a normal hardcast. Sounds like it was taken from 400 to 350%, as Pyroclasm applies additional damage on top of the spell's original punch.<br />
<br />
Even if the spell offers a second stack to cut down on the loss of hardcast Pyro bonuses, chopping the bonus down this way seems far worse than reducing the proc rate - especially if Blizzard favors movement heavy fights.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like it was taken from 400 to 350%, as Pyroclasm applies additional damage on top of the spell's original punch.<br />
<br />
Even if the spell offers a second stack to cut down on the loss of hardcast Pyro bonuses, chopping the bonus down this way seems far worse than reducing the proc rate - especially if Blizzard favors movement heavy fights.<br />
Someone in the Discord implied they may be balancing the damage around an azerite trait. Hope that's not true. I really wanted to use this talent competitively without stretching to make it work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't earn the heritage armour if you boost or race change.<br />
<br />
Assuming Mag'har starts at level 20 (i'm not sure) then you have to level 20-120. They should change the wording, &quot;newly created&quot; is sort of ambiguous.</div></div><hr />

The real annoyance here is that not one dev has actually taken the time to write in forum posts. Some great Shaman have compiled HOURS of gameplay and Blizzard Dev's have not replied to one of the posts.<br />
<br />
I know that the general public is cynical, especially in wow... But this might be one of the first xpacs that I've seen so much discontent regarding the classes.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should have stated months ago that Legion Artifact Wep's would make us seriously over-powered &quot;to defeat the legion&quot; and that BfA was going to bring us back down from that.<br />
<br />
Ele Shaman, regardless of Barakashama's comments, have ridiculously slow cast's and terrible maelstrom generation..<br />
<br />
I love Ele Shaman and Fire Mage why must you destory both my classes, Blizz! Any explanation, ANY, would be nice. I'd take a &quot;So we just don't have the resources at this time&quot; just so I felt like there was some attention being given to our class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gross. I don't enjoy talents requiring legendary XYZLMNOP to function as intended, and while I can't immediately name such situations in Legion (if any), I would rather that talents stand alone in themselves rather than be crippled and dependent on a specific drop or trait.</div></div><hr />

Am I misreading this. How is it account wide when only Mag'har orcs can wear it?</div></div><hr />
