PTR Development Notes - Build 23753<br />
This week’s PTR update contains mostly tuning changes, which include some of the mechanisms around the Broken Shore, but also a large round of adjustments to Legendary items. These adjustments are part of our overall goal to bring Legendaries more in line with each other in terms of value, particularly in how their benefits apply to your primary role (tanking, DPS, or healing).<br />
<br />
This first round of adjustments is not comprehensive - in fact, we’ve already made some additional changes since this build was put together, and we expect tuning to continue as part of an ongoing process. Still, we’d greatly appreciate your feedback on these changes, as well as on any other Legendaries that are still in need of tuning. We’ve created a separate thread here with more details on exactly what changes have been made.<br />
<br />
Thanks, and happy testing!<br />
<br />
<br />
PTR Build Deploy 3/14/2017<br />
Greetings all,<br />
PTR Realms will be coming down today in order to deploy a new 7.2.0 build. No ETA for today's push but I'll ping the thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual.<br />
<br />
As always, I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. <br />
<br />

Just take off Frostbrand, leave it at 30% and you fixed the problem. Why is this so god damn difficult?</div></div><hr />

If you think the bracers are bad, you are retarded. Lowest CD of any cheat death that puts out actually decent throughput if you use it correctly...<br />
<br />
Secondly, they nerfed the shield amount, but slapped more stats on the thing. It's probably more of a buff than a nerf.<br />

I will never understand how the problem with pure utility legendaries was not recognized by the devs immediately during design and how it took so long to correct, but great changes nonetheless. Such a simple fix.<br />
<br />
easy because they underestimate players, and to an extent the value of legendaries, as most players look at absolute values, so which will give me the biggest dps/healing/tanking boost and undervaluing things like utility and surviveablilty (for non tanks) boosts, I mean look how hard it can be to get some players to use defensive abilities that are part of their class to make other players jobs easier in dungeons/raids, compound that with several specs having legendaries that massive increase their performance/output to reinforce the idea that if a legendary is not a dps boost it's bad</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a typo, item says .4s extension per chi for SEF and .3 extension per chi for Serenity.<br />
<br />
---<br />
Shitty napkin math<br />
---<br />
Curently: <br />
2 charges, 15s duration, 1min 30s CD per charge<br />
Average of 17 chi would be +10.2s per charge<br />
basically looking at a 25-26s duration per charge, giving it an effective 1min 5s cd per charge<br />
Over a 10 minute fight looking at 10 SEF.<br />
<br />
In 7.2 with trait:<br />
2 charges, 15s Duration, 1minute 18s CD per charge<br />
Average of 17 chi would be +6.8s per charge<br />
looking at a 21-22 second duration per charge, giving an effective cooldown of 57 seconds per charge<br />
Over a 10 minute fight looking at 10 SEF.<br />
---<br />
So you looking basically the same number of SEF uses, but you're looking at losing around 4 seconds of SEF per use, and about 40 seconds of SEF uptime over a 10 minute encounter.</div></div><hr />

there are better classes for cleave and aoe, WW has a that stupid mark of the crane buff they have to put up on adds and because if the shitty tab targetting atm its just not worth it for me sometimes, why the fuck am i targetting something thats thats underneath us in kara instead of the mobs infront of me.

Yeah, it's getting super old, but I think hell will freeze over before tab targetting is ever fixed.<br />
