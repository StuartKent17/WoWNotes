Mythic Plus Explosive Affix Hotfix<br />
We've recently pushed a hotfix that should result in fewer Explosive spawns on certain bosses in Underrot, Temple of Sethraliss, and King's Rest on Mythic+ difficulty. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1054916822766481408))<br />

Mythic Plus Azerite Armor Vendor Now on PTR<br />
Thaumaturge Vashreen is now on the PTR and selling Mythic Plus Azerite Armor caches and specific pieces for the new currency, Azerite Impurity (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-azerite-impurity). While we don't know the amount of Azerite Impurity (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-azerite-impurity) rewarded from your mythic plus cache or breaking down pieces, we do know the costs on the vendor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Item Level 355 Cache - 125 Azerite Impurity (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-azerite-impurity)<br />
Item Level 370 Cache - 400 Azerite Impurity (https://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/1718-azerite-impurity)<br />

Conquest Rewards Adjustment - Oct. 23<br />
With weekly maintenance in each region, we've adjusted some Conquest rewards for Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
Now, when you Rated Battleground ends in defeat, depending on how closely you lost (how near to the winning team in points/flag captures/etc.), you can gain 20-40 Conquest. Additionally:<br />
<br />
2v2 – First win of the day rewards 35 Conquest; additional wins rewards 25 Conquest (was 10). Rated Battlegrounds – First win of the day rewards 150 Conquest (was 100); additional wins reward 100 Conquest (was 65).<br />
<br />
Rewards for 3v3 and unrated Battlegrounds have not been changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
PSA: We're currently working on a hotfix that will increase the gold and Azerite rewards from Emissary quests. We hope to have this change live within the next 24 hours, so if you have an active Emissary that rewards gold or Azerite, you may want to wait to complete it! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/warcraftdevs/status/1054875828293533696?s=21))<br />
<br />
With weekly maintenance in each region, we’ve increased the Conquest gained from 2v2 Arenas by 250%, and Rated Battlegrounds by 50%. See our thread here (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769708072) for the details. (WarcraftDevs (<br />

In the newest PTR build, Flaskzertauren will be selling new chest and shoulder items that contain the newest Azerite traits for testing.<br />
Flaskzertauren is located in The Great Seal of Dazar’alor for Horde, and the Harbormaster’s Office in Boralus for Alliance. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1052671582865305601))<br />

Do I need to have my artifact weapon equipped to be able to do the &quot;win ten rated battlegrounds&quot; tint unlock now that BfA is out? I'm not sure if the weapon scales for pvp which would make winning difficult.<br />
You don’t need to have your Artifact weapon equipped or transmogged onto the weapon you're using in order to earn progress towards unlocking any Artifact look or tint. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1052258959367626752)) <br />

Raid Testing Schedule - October 25th-26th<br />
On Thursday, October 25th and Friday, October 26th we will be conducting raid tests of the Battle of Dazar'alor. <br />
<br />
BOTH FACTIONS:<br />
Testing is open for both factions. However, for some bosses, raid members will temporarily re-live events as the opposite faction using a story flashback.<br />
<br />
Thursday, October 25th<br />
<br />
King Rastakhan- Heroic Battle of Dazar'alor<br />
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br />
Horde will experience this boss as if they were Alliance.<br />
High Tinker Mekkatorque - Heroic Battle of Dazar'alor<br />
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br />
Alliance will experience this boss as if they were Horde. <br />
<br />
Friday, October 26th<br />
<br />
Champion of the Light: Frida Ironbellows (Horde) / Ra’Wani (Alliance) - Mythic Battle of Dazar'alor<br />
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br />
Each faction will test their respective Champion of the Light boss <br />
Stormwall Blockade - Heroic Battle of Dazar'alor<br />
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br />
Alliance will experience this boss as if they were Horde. <br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a test environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br />
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested. <br />
<br />
Q: How long does testing last?<br />
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.</div></div><hr />

there's a difference between a reasonable amount of a time and an unreasonable amount of time. They're just making your play more by spacing things out such an extreme amount.</div></div><hr />

This means, once you acquire a specific piece, the next patch will be just around the corner if they stick to the legion patch timing.<br />

Oh and suddenly Dagger in the Back gets a nerf and that piece isn't great anymore.<br />
<br />
Why not an item you can buy from Dudebro that lets you upgrade a Mythic+ Piece (and ONLY a M+ Piece) 15 ilvl with progressively increasing costs?<br />
<br />
Example: 340-355 is 100 Magic Whateverthefucks, 355-370 is 200 Magic Whateverthefucks, 370-385 is 300 Magic Whateverthefucks.</div></div><hr />

Ya mon, had to read 1st bluepost again. Their goal is you're able to buy 385 random piece every 2-3 weeks, and a targeted 385 will be a long term goal. I don't envy people that will try going for multiple sets.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind maintaining a sub because I have something to do, or aim for - AS LONG AS THE PROCESS IS ACTUALLY FUN.<br />
<br />
Grinding out M+ every week purely for currency and refusing to trade gear to other people to salvage it for currency is not fun to me. Maybe it is to other people, I can't judge that. But I am not resubbing over this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will get currency once a week from the weekly m+ chest depending on your highest completed m+ dungeon. You can also get currency from scrapping Azerite Items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said that the currency comes from two locations: a very small amount scrapping or disenchanting an appropriate level azerite item gained after 8.1 or the weekly chest. <br />
<br />
So it's a time gate.</div></div><hr />

The only real &quot;fix&quot; i can see for the drop part of Azerite armor is to simply have the armor drop like any other loot at the end of a dungeon.

<br />
First, we’re adding a new (as yet unnamed) currency, which you’ll earn from your weekly Mythic+ chest as well as from scrapping (or disenchanting) epic-quality Azerite Armor. This currency is rewarded in addition to the item in the chest (which can no longer be an Azerite piece), and the amount you earn will scale up based on the highest level Keystone you’ve completed. For example, completing a level 10 Keystone will reward you with about three times as much as clearing a level 7. Similarly, scrapping higher-item-level Azerite pieces will give you significantly higher amounts of this currency than lower-level pieces.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't have mattered because Blizz said anything from pre-8.1 wouldn't yield the currency anyway. They almost always do that just to prevent exactly what you're thinking of.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand why not just let azerite gear drop from M+ as any other slot, but okay...<br />
<br />
A currency should be a way to compensate bad luck, not a way to add more RNG. The weeklye cache should keep it's chance to drop azerite gear, with bad luck protection in place, making it that if after a reasonable amount of time you didn't get any piece or you got one you dind't like, you have a system in place to get what you want.<br />
<br />
That should be the concept: you have a chance each week, but if after 3-4 weeks you didn't have any luck, that's fine: head to vendor and choose your new azerite piece, you totally earned it.<br />
<br />
That's the currency concept that can work, not this silly choice between guaranteed random piece vs way too long time investment just to avoid the slot machine. If the chance to get something is too low or the time it takes is too long it doesn't really matter that we get to choose or that we are able to target that piece of gear, it's just not worth my time and i'd rather spend those weeks playing something else that has a little more respect for me as a customer.</div></div><hr />

if it takes you 3 months it's quite literally pointless since by the time you get it it's obsolete.<br />
<br />
look at that the blue wrote previously. Taking the blue post information, completing a +10 for the week should allow you to buy Relinquished Azerite Helm in 2-3 weeks, which means a targeted piece would take around 6 weeks to obtain, considering current ratios.<br />
<br />
&quot;We’re still nailing down the exact numbers, but our goal for tuning this new currency is that you’ll be able to purchase one of the Azerite caches that lines up roughly with the item level of the gear you’re getting from your Mythic+ runs every two or three weeks&quot;<br />
<br />
One CACHE aka random piece 2-3 weeks. Now look at the prices from random piece to targeted. And apply math. Its literally stupid considering they want to patch in 3 month cycles lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying their current fix is perfect; however, if they did as you suggest, two things would need to happen:<br />
<br />
1) Allow ALL potential Azerite pieces to drop from the end of every Mythic; or<br />
2) Fix Specific Azerite pieces to drop from said dungeon<br />
<br />
These would then cause the following:<br />
<br />
a) make RNG pull from a ridiculous pool size of possible gear; or<br />
b) limit which classes run specific dungeons (current issue)<br />
i) Some classes are naturally better suited to run specific dungeons, even more so with certain weekly affixes<br />
ii) Running the same dungeon gets boring FAST when you need to run only that one for a very specific piece of gear already (non-Azerite).</div></div><hr />

Well after all this stuff goes live, you'll be able to scrap any epic quality azerite you get. So emissary cache, warfront, possibly world boss and LFR azerite/Mythic 0.</div></div><hr />

People who will want to aim 385 gear are mostly raiders / hardcore players, by the time they'll get 2 specific 385 items the 385ilvl will be irrelevant with <br />
the new 420ilvl raid gear that will be out by then.<br />
Blizzard are specialists in putting nice ilvl gear at a vendore that you can aim for but by the time you will actually get it it will be useless<br />
just like they did with the gear you get when you're exalted with BfA factions: 355ilvl when you're already should be well above 360 (unless you're 100% casual).</div></div><hr />

Except that you won't get Azerite from weekly cache after this change and M+ keys don't drop azerite armor. Your sources for this will be Emmisary cache drops, raid drops, and however many M0 you can stomach for drops.

They said in their first announcement that they are balancing the amount of points you get around it taking 2 to 3 weeks to get a &quot;random&quot; piece of gear cache. By that logic, and only if you're doing mythic 10+s, you can expect to get a specific piece of gear after a minimum of 6 weeks at the very best, and more likely around 8 to 10 weeks. Considerably longer if you're only a &quot;casual&quot; mythic+ player (5-9)<br />

What is the point in the 355 and 370 options? Random, lower ilvl, ilvl that can be obtained through emissary and by the time this all shows up there will be a new raid where LFR drops 355ish, normal 370 etc? I don't actually see the point in the random 355 and 370 pieces.<br />
<br />
Maybe it is more beneficial to you going for an ilvl that's one tier below the highest. They said +10 will give you 3 times the currency +7 gives you. So you should be able to get 370 gear way faster than 385 which means you could go for your BiS and actually get it midtier.</div></div><hr />

So emissary cache, warfront, possibly world boss and LFR azerite/Mythic 0.<br />
<br />
Which doesn't matter at all until we see how much currency these items are breaking down to, vs how much higher-end pieces cost. <br />
<br />
People really need to wait and see how this plays out. Until we see the final setup in the live version of the game, this is basically just pre-order hype.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it is more beneficial to you going for an ilvl that's one tier below the highest. They said +10 will give you 3 times the currency +7 gives you. So you should be able to get 370 gear way faster than 385 which means you could go for your BiS and actually get it midtier.<br />
<br />
But the 355 and 370 are totally random and the ilvl will be fairly obsolete by that point. I see your point I just find it kind of pointless especially the 355. Even for new players LFR will be more beneficial and so will world quests and save your mythic currency for the 385 target or random.<br />

I am interested to see how much you get overall from the cache and the scrap. If scrap is good enough I won't be sad doing 10 M0 a week and all my WQ to get some extra currency if it remotely worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what exactly is your point? That we should settle with what we get through the random 385 pieces? and be happy with that? While that might be fine for a casual player who only does that +10 every week its not fine for anyone who does high M+ or Mythic raiding those parts of the games requries you to gear your character at the best possible way you can.<br />
<br />
This dosent even begin to take into account what happens when you want to biuld multiple gear sets like one for Single Target one for AOE and then there is healing and Tanking. With the random system youll get about 1 item every 2-3 weeks according to Blizzard themselvs meaning you can buy 6 pieces every 3 months of you get one every 2 weeks.<br />
Each tier lasts about 3-4 months so after that higher pieces will come out and youll need to start over again. And again Blizzard intended for us to have multiple sets of azerite armor to switch between for different situations at the same time they dont want us to reforge.<br />
<br />
It would have been more fair to the players if they let the Azerite armor drop from end of the dungeon instead of this timegating nonsens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm saying you should do +10 and get specific 370 gear since you can get it thrice as fast compared to 385 gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That might be fine for the casual player but for those of us who want to aim for the top end gear this system really isnt good enough. As again the idea behind this isnt just to get just 3 pieces and thats it you would be needing to carry about 5-9 pieces depending on class and avilable viable traits.<br />
<br />
And if you do spend those 5-7 weeks to get that shiny 385 and then the traits on it is nerfed shortly after i would expect quite alot of saltiness and rightfully so.<br />
<br />
Azerite armor as a concept is deeply flawed and so poorly implemented in the game its no wonder so many people absolutely hate it. And that sucks but its easy to see the potentional behind the system if they just changed the things people hate about it.<br />
But in Blizzard efforts to make content last as long as possible through artifical means they are ruining the players experience of the game.</div></div><hr />

Thaumaturge Vashreen is now on the PTR and selling Mythic Plus Azerite Armor caches and specific pieces for the new currency, Azerite Impurity. While we don't know the amount of Azerite Impurity rewarded from your mythic plus cache or breaking down pieces, we do know the costs on the vendor.<br />
chaud is it possible to copy a toon and then scrap or de an azerite piece?<br />
<br />
cant really test because i dont have the 50gb of hdd space<br />
<br />
I did, I scraped a 370 Azerite piece on PTR and got nothing</div></div><hr />
