<br />
When a human is found unconscious on the shores of Kalimdor, with no memory of who he is or how he arrived there, how will he survive? Enslaved by an Orc Shaman, he must fight for survival against members of both the Alliance and the Horde. Will he strike the uneasy balance with the other races he'll need to find the secrets of his past?<br />

<br />
I'm actually going to start studying comic book art =3 just because that looks so awesome (My current style is more anime-esque..)</div></div><hr />
