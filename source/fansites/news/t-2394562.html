@_@Forgot all about that and tbh i think blizz has too! Its not like kids dont grow up in WoW i mean look at Anduin and Nomi!!</div></div><hr />

(Adding a toy you can buy for 50 silver in 2015 doesn't count as an update.) Legion even had the perfect opportunity for a lore-friendly new questline, since the Nightborne had children models and we were helping refugees from the city. It's pretty ridiculous. There should be a new child to bring around for every expansion.<br />
<br />
It's also high time that there at least be some small reference or easter egg for the original children finally growing up and how they turned out. Pretty sure the human orphan started out roughly the same age as Anduin, and Anduin is now king. It'd be a nice touch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trassk</div><div class="date">2018-05-02, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">blizzard has had many opportunities to update this event. Pandaria, could have had a pandaren kid, Warlords, could have had a brown skin orc kid or arakoa kid or another draenei kid. Legion, could have had a suramar elf kid or even make an actual tauren youth (that isn't just a shrunk down version of a tauren)<br />
<br />
But no, lets instead hype up an event thats been the same year after year with nothing new to look forward to.</div></div><hr />
