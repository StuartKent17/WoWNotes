Actually, I'm more hoping for some rogue changes.<br />
Looking at the T10 mage talent, you get 50% crit damage increase for 2 talent points.<br />
The T10 rogue equivalent needs 5 talent points to get 25% crit increase, and it ONLY works if your health is higher than the target... That's kind of silly.<br />
<br />
Also eagerly making ritual sacrifices to anyone listening in hopes of getting more inscription updates.</div></div><hr />

We actually have to use 5 points like rogues, plus, it burns 5% of the spell's critical cost. That's why its called &quot;Burnout&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />

Like move Blood Frenzy into the fury tree or very low in the arms tree..<br />
<br />
As of now besides rogue ( who doesn't need any since they are best single target dps ) , warrior is the only one with a dps spec that brings no utility.. <br />
<br />
Add onto that no cc and fury warriors are going be be even less popular in raiding. 5 mans etc..<br />
<br />
Pretty sad even the new dks in all 3 trees bring raid utility..</div></div><hr />

Looking at the T10 mage talent, you get 50% crit damage increase for 2 talent points.<br />
The T10 rogue equivalent needs 5 talent points to get 25% crit increase, and it ONLY works if your health is higher than the target... That's kind of silly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spell crits only do +50% extra crit bonus damage, whereas melee is +100%, and the 50% crit damage increase is of those 50%, that is, the increase from the talent is really 25% of the base damage, the same as the rogue talent. You seem to be talking of Spell Power, which is not a new talent at all, just moved to a deeper tier. If you look at the equivalent new talent for fire, it is 5 points like the rogue one, and has a penalty too. In general, the new talents seem weaker point for point than some of the old ones. In any case, you can't compare single talents across classes, or even across trees. The arcane crit increasing talent may be more powerful than the fire one because arcane lacks other multiplicative modifier talents as powerful as firepower and empowered fireball. And the rogue is different, and all in all apparently quite competetive when looking at the full picture.</div></div><hr />
