<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Markanis</div><div class="date">2007-08-22, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just read that buffed.de thing and guess what, new CoT Instance: Stratholme, you're going to help Arthas &quot;cleanse&quot; the city and burn it. And they are thinking about making the Death Knight unlockable at about 55-60 maybe so that you don't level like a mad-man to level 80 just to have it because they think it isn't fun. AND they are also thinking (remember 'thinking' ;)) about adding the Blademaster and Jeff Kaplan would like to see the Demonhunter and Archmage so...hintedy hint hint eh? ^_^</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lithander</div><div class="date">2007-08-23, 12:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some interesting passages summed up:<br />
<br />
- New CoT Instance Stratholme.<br />
- Fight alongside Arthas, &quot;cleanse&quot; the city from the scourge and burn the houses.<br />
- It's a 5 man instance for level 80 characters. It's planned that you come back to the instance repeatedly on level 80.<br />
- CoT-Stratholme has nothing to do with unlocking or developing the Deathknight storyline.<br />
- Death-Knight starts probably in the level range 55 to 60.<br />
- You don't need to be 80 to unlock the Death-Knight. 55 to 60 is most likely enough.<br />
- They will explain in detail why &quot;your&quot; Death-Knight manages to defy the cotroll of the lich king.<br />
- Any race can become a death-knight. You unlock the DK with a character and the DK will be of that race even if it is a gnome. :P You'll still keep your old char though.<br />
- Seems like you have to face some challenge or test after the creation of the DK, only if you succeed you get your Death Knight. (all pretty vague, there's no hint however that you can't repeat that challenge or that any other mechanic is planned to avoid anyone and his mom rolling a DK.)<br />
- They developed a system that allows the runes to light up on the weapon when the combo is changed. (combination of runes?)<br />

I really hope this isn't accurate... I have no desire to be a friggin Tauren death knight, and I really don't want to level an undead to 55 just so I can have one with a useful racial ability...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
i agree with you 100%. its just stupid, its the most dumb idea ever to do it like this.<br />
<br />
1. what about all the made progress like reputation? honor points? etc etc<br />
2. nobody wants to lvl a new character from 60 till 80 just to have a death knight, its not even your own its pre made, wow i play with a premade character, how cool is that........well its not. i want to feel i am that character. and you only get that if you lvl from 1 till the end!<br />
3 its just stupid^^<br />
<br />
i still think its better to transform a character into a death knight (or any other hero class) then a new 1. they just have to put in like 6 or 7 hero classes and let people choose if they want to transform and into what they transform!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would rather be Undead more than anything else. Plate looking cool on them is about the only thing good about it a Tauren. Taurens are massive targets in PVP and warstomp is absolutely worthless. I would much rather have Will of the Forsaken which is probably one of the best racials in the game. Also not being able to fit through doors on your mount is a real bummer...</div></div><hr />

So what your trying to say is.... racials stay when you become a DK? :&gt;<br />
And how are you aware of such info? :]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going from the above post, whatever race you complete the DK quest with, is the race your DK will be... So with this information, after completing the quests, I will be a Tauren Deathknight... Which taking a small assumption, means I will have the same racials...</div></div><hr />

Blizz rly put the details a notch higher it seems for WotlK (enviroment wize that is), and from what we hear, the quests and everything should be a bit different too (not that we won't get our 'go kill 20 hell chicken' usual quests...). I hope they meet the expecations they're giving us!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Racials are carefuly balanced to not upset classes, now if every race could be DK... They'd be able to choose (to some extent) what resist they want for a racial, or what proffesion, or to be or not be snare/stun immune. That's just a load of cr*p if you ask me...</div></div><hr />

This is what he's quoted to have said there:<br />
<br />
<br />
Ja, wir haben eine Entscheidung getroffen. Aber wundert Euch nicht, wenn wir uns doch noch mal anders entscheiden. Wisst Ihr, Spiel-Design ist eine sehr flexible Geschichte. Aktuell wird aber jede Rasse zum Todesritter, als auch Gnome. Wir haben einige Dinge seit der BlizzCon überdacht. So müssen Spielercharaktere wahrscheinlich nicht mehr Level 80 sein, um den Todesritter freizuspielen. Wahrscheinlich geht das schon früher. Wie ein Wahnsinniger auf Level 80 zu spielen, nur um möglichst schnell den Todesritter zu bekommen, macht keinen Spaß. Es bringt die Leute dazu, durch das Spiel zu hetzen. Wir werden daher wahrscheinlich etwas anderes machen. Wir haben viele Ideen dazu. Wir haben uns zwar noch nicht auf eine Sache festgelegt, aber vielleicht wird der Todesritter schon zwischen Level 55 und 60 freigeschaltet. Dann erstellt Ihr Euren Todesritter und dann durchlauft Ihr Eure Bewährungsprobe. Wenn Ihr die bewältigt habt, bekommt Ihr Euren Todesritter.<br />
<br />
Which I translate as:<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, we made a decision.But don't be surprised if we decide to change our minds. You know, game design is a very flexible matter. Right now, every race can become a Death Knight, even Gnomes. We have thought through some things since BlizzCon. Players probably don't have to be level 80 to unlock the Death Knight, the class will be accessible earlier. Powerleveling to level 80 in order to get to play the Death Knight as soon as possible is no fun and makes people rush through the game. Most likely we'll find a different solution. We do have a lot of ideas regarding this topic. We haven't decided yet, but maybe the DK will be unlockable between level 55 and 60. You can then create your Death Knights, after creation you have to go through a trial. When you pass it you get your Death Knight.<br />
<br />
Pretty vague stuff. :/ The trial sounds fun though!</div></div><hr />

Point is, if done well, u'd probably get some part of the accuracy back by retranslating it back to English (in my experience anyways, and it's part of my job, just my 2 cents...)</div></div><hr />
