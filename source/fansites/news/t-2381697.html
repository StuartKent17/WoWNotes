Mike Morhaime on 20 Years of StarCraft Esports<br />
Mike Morhaime, president and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment, goes back to the beginning with StarCraft, and has had a hand in every expression of the sci-fi title since then. Beyond his involvement in creating the original game, Morhaime has been a fan of StarCraft esports since before esports was even a word. On the 20th anniversary of StarCraft, Morhaime took time to share some of his favorite memories on the growth of the game’s esports scene.<br />
<br />
When StarCraft was released in 1998, Blizzard was already known for real-time strategy (RTS) games. Warcraft and Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness were two of the genre's top titles, so when it came time to make a new game, another RTS was the obvious choice.<br />
<br />
“The artists were tired of drawing fantasy, so we thought we’d set this one in space,” said Morhaime. “The first pass was converting all of our tilesets. We used the Warcraft II engine and reskinned it, and we showed up at E3. People were pretty underwhelmed. There weren’t any mechanics yet. We had three months to put something together, and nobody was raving about our game yet.”<br />
<br />
Back in 1996, the first alpha version of StarCraft was skewered by critics as “Warcraft in space.” Seeing the unenthusiastic response lit a fire under the nascent crew of Blizzard developers.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/march/thumb/mmsc01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/march/mmsc01.jpg) <br />
<br />
“There were a lot of RTSs in development at the time, and we felt like we needed to do much better,&quot; Morhaime said. &quot;So Bob Fitch rewrote the engine, we modified the art, and really leveled up our ambitions for the game.”<br />
<br />
When StarCraft launched in March of 1998, it received high praise and became the best-selling PC game of the year. But as Morhaime soon found out, that achievement unlocked a new horizon: people were playing the game on a serious, competitive level.<br />
<br />
As Morhaime said, “There were companies that were doing tournaments, so we added support in Battle.net for pro players to have gamer tags. Then we started hearing that it was taking off in Korea and that there was a lot of competition going on. I hadn’t really seen anything like that until I took a trip out there. When we hit two million copies sold they held this big celebration, and this auditorium was completely packed. That was the first live esports event I ever went to.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/march/thumb/mmsc02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/march/mmsc02.jpg) <br />
<br />
“It was incredible. The crowd was really into it and they were cheering every time something happened. It was so much fun and there were so many people there. The fans were completely into it. It was amazing.<br />
<br />
“The other thing that was surprising was that everyone there knew StarCraft. You could talk to people at the hotel or even people on the street, and StarCraft was a household thing. At the event, I gave a short little speech, and I introduced Bob Fitch as the lead programmer of StarCraft. He got a standing ovation.”<br />
<br />
It was the birth of something special. Korea’s interest in StarCraft had exploded, and Morhaime had a front-row seat to the burgeoning esports scene in Seoul. For Blizzard as a whole, exploring new ways to support StarCraft esports fans, players, and casters begat more support for StarCraft as a franchise.<br />
<br />
“Every time I visited Korea I got to see something live,” Morhaime said. “They’d have little mini-stadiums and stages where people could compete. There was an esports studio at the COEX [Mall].&quot;<br />
<br />
“I went to the opening of GSL [Global StarCraft II League]. After the opening, every time I came to GSL I would go and watch the games in their studio and just get a bunch of pizzas for everyone. I remember Artosis [caster Dan Stemkowski] would complain because there were no vegetarian pizzas, and he’s a vegetarian. I don’t eat pepperoni either, so I always made sure to get a vegetarian pizza for myself [and for] Artosis.”<br />
<br />
StarCraft was a phenomenon and in Korea it had become a household name. But without the engaged and popular esports scene that Korea boasted, few in the West knew about the high-level play that professionals were exhibiting there. If only there were an event that Western audiences could get behind to experience the thrill of esports. Enter the BlizzCon, in 2005.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/march/thumb/mmsc03.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/march/mmsc03.jpg) <br />
<br />
“Although BlizzCon grew out of the desire to have a World of Warcraft fan meetup, we decided to make it into a festival celebrating all of our games,” Morhaime said. “At the time StarCraft and Warcraft III esports were both pretty big, so we did invitational tournaments for each of those games. Esports wasn’t really a mainstream thing in the U.S. yet, so I think this was really exposing people to esports more than anything. People loved it.&quot;<br />
<br />
“There was a year [2011] we had the GSL Finals at BlizzCon,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I think it was MMA vs Mvp, and MMA won. The hall was completely packed. There were people sitting on the floor because we ran out of seats. They had some technical difficulties with soundproofing the player booths or something, so it went very late into the evening on Friday night. And it was just awesome because everyone stayed. They had to fill time, so they showed a documentary about Tasteless living in Korea. So we just waited, and the games were awesome and epic, the crowd was awesome, and it was this really great moment because StarCraft II was still pretty young.”<br />
<br />
StarCraft II, which launched in July 2010, had a lot to live up to. With such a huge scene of ravenous fans, big expectations fell on a second installment to the popular franchise and the development team was committed to making a game worthy of the name StarCraft. After being developed under the codename Medusa, Blizzard announced the highly anticipated sequel to a gargantuan crowd in Seoul.<br />
<br />
“In 2007, we rented out the Olympic Park and had a Worldwide Invitational event, which was mostly themed around StarCraft. We had some Korean K-pop bands come and play, like Super Junior, Ivy, and Psy was our headliner. When we played the StarCraft II cinematic and made the announcement, that was huge.”<br />
<br />
Looking back on the long and rich history of the franchise, Morhaime shares his unique perspective as a fan—albeit one with some influence—on StarCraft’s place in the esports pantheon.<br />
<br />
“I think with StarCraft II we were a little bit late, coming 12 years after the original,” he said. “If we were a little earlier, it would’ve been better for the game. But I think [it] has a permanent place in the history of esports because StarCraft II, at least in the very early years of Twitch, was the game of choice, and a key reason they decided to start the company in the first place.&quot;<br />
<br />
With his hands-on development years behind him and his duties as president of Blizzard front and center, Morhaime still follows the game’s esports scene as an informed fan. He attends live events, holds occasional viewing parties at home, and keeps up with the best of the best as they display their skills on a global stage.<br />
<br />
“I think esports is like regular sports or a live concert,&quot; Morhaime said. &quot;It’s qualitatively different when you’re there with other people sharing the experience with the crowd. Even when you’re watching online, it’s important to hear the cheers of the crowd to make it feel more real.”<br />
<br />
Bringing that level of connection to fans is one of StarCraft’s main contributions to the conversation around gaming over the past 20 years. Like millions of others around the world, Mike Morhaime, the StarCraft esports fan, is ready to see what the next two decades of StarCraft will bring.</div></div><hr />

If you can find someone with those pets out, and you can be sure SOME people will be doing that while AFKing in Dalaran, Stormwind or Orgrimmar, then yes, you can get it. But would you want to?</div></div><hr />

Forced business that goes against the idea of making games to experience creative talent, and instead promote the idea of making meaningless games to be forgotten in an history of endless and pointless entertainment for generations to come.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Accurate. They made an ecosystem that mirrored many aspects of RL and all they think of is money... a little disheartening when you imagine the possibilities instead of sucking up to the lowest common denominators.<br />

<br />
The diablo 3 pet is literally a recolor of the battlecruiser model from sc2 ported to d3 as a pet.<br />
The overwatch skin is a recolor of the base skin for widowmaker.<br />
The hots icons are the exact same icons that have been available in sc2 for years.<br />
The HS rewards are 3 random card packs, nuff said.<br />
<br />

So? Why not give WoW a recoloured Zergling, Baneling or Mini-Thor pet then? Instead we get a FoS which will sit tucked away in the achiev tab for no one to ever even see.</div></div><hr />

Like they wouldn't give a recoloured version of a collector's edition mount for free? Oh wait, there's like 3 dread ravens now...<br />
I bought SC2 collector's edition and have the green Baneling pet, don't see the harm in people getting a purple one for the SC 20th anniversary.</div></div><hr />

How is that moving the goalpost? A recolor of a base unit from SC2 and a recolored widowmaker is not the same as handing everyone a free version of the pets from the most rare CEs.<br />

hm, let's see, just yesterday I had last boss in seat (or whatever is the instance in mcaree called) bug so that it never left the invulnerable phase. Getting wiped took some effort as there isn't much damage to be taken.<br />
Last boss in pit of saron doesn't activate more times that it does (and then there's the bug with the dmg increased buff that should be slowing him down, but instead speeds him up)<br />
Just after last patch, mobs on stairs in violet hold would evade<br />

<br />
Well, some of us apparently have higher standards of quality, because I'd argue an ability not working as soon as there's slight bump in the way is pretty gamebreaking. I mean would you really expect the game &quot;not work&quot; happening in an AAA title nowadays? Though people are being plagued by FPS drops since mid 2017. When I run the game on my macbook, half of the time I get ~20 FPS which gets fixed by increasing (???) graphic settings.</div></div><hr />

It's a difference of definition, not standards. A gamebreaking bug is a bug that breaks the game, aka 'you can't play anymore'. Getting a disconnect as soon as you open a bag is gamebreaking. Having a boss bug on you, is a bug. It doesn't break the game, it breaks the encounter and (most likely) not even always. Bug &lt;&gt; gamebreaking bug.</div></div><hr />

This is just lame as hell. Recolor a pet, make a toy - something. We are paying a subscription to a game during a content drought; I don't give a crap that there's an expansion coming up, as it's half a year away and I already paid for that, too.</div></div><hr />

You need to learn the difference between &quot;omg this sucks&quot; and &quot;This is bad because ____.&quot; I know it's hard to grasp, but there is a such thing as a valid complaint, and in fact, they are actually quite common. <br />
<br />
There is nothing about this achievement that is fun or likable. It's as if they literally did nothing, and they might as well have done nothing since there is no event, there are no rewards, and the feat of strength literally means nothing. In fact, for extra salt to the wound, all of the Starcraft pets are from collectors editions, so even getting the achievement depends on the generosity of others or you happening to (or going out of your way to) buy a copy yourself. I would not be surprised if Blizzard is hoping someone might buy a digital deluxe version of the game to get this garbage Feat of Strength.<br />
<br />
I'm being quite serious when I say that it would have been better to add nothing at all. It would be less offensive than this garbage, lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
Give players PLAYER HOUSING in WoD... Players bitch about not seeing people in the world anymore.. just can't win<br />
<br />
Bullshit. You can give someone piss and call it peach tea, but that doesn't make it acceptable for when someone asks for something to drink.<br />
<br />
Calling Garrisons housing is an excuse for blizzard to not actually work on what people wanted, if anything they are using this as an excuse to never add it. And that's fine, I'm not complaining about it but making posts like this is pure garbage. You should damn well know better.<br />

If for some reason you are struggling to get it, just PM me and I will make an alt on your server (assuming you are not EU, if you are, I can't help you unfortunately).
