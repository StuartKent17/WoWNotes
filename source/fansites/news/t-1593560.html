And answer a question with a question: Why not reward players who subscribe every month?<br />
<br />
Lmao! What a joke... What rewards have I gotten for being subscribed to this game for 9 years uninterrupted? Beta access isn't really a 'reward' considering it goes away, few pets here and there from anniversary stuff again not directly related to being subbed for so long, I had to PROMISE TO SUB for a year to get free diablo 3 (glad it was free, I would have felt ripped off if I bought it), but that wasn't a reward for my loyalty to the game, but a reward for my loyalty to a promise with a predetermined reward. A reward for keeping your sub should be a nice surprise and not a bribe like the one year contract was. It would be simple to give people who have been subbed for 5, 7, even 10 years some awesome title or in game item exclusive to the amount of time you have played the game without canceling your sub. Really hope this expac is on point... Otherwise, I'll finally cut this out of my life.<br />
<br />
To clarify, I don't care about the &quot;legendary&quot; that you could get in LFR being removed.</div></div><hr />

It expires a monthish from the expansion release, and I presume it's not the 90 you get with the expansion (since that doesn't expire, and you wouldn't be told in-game to 'log out to boost your character.') So... yeah, that's odd.</div></div><hr />

You probably have items other people who didn't play back then didn't have. On top of that you probably remember those one-off events and the weird stuff that entailed. THAT is the reward.<br />
<br />
Wanting something on top of that is being greedy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would make logical sense. IIRC, the Asian version of WoW comes with all expansions baseline, but charges by the hour for access (due to the differences in gaming culture.) Giving the Asian players one free 90 per account if they play within a month of the expansion's launch is roughly equal to us getting a free 90 when we buy the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are so many other ways to reward players who subscribe every month than removing content... This is the first time a legendary quest is removed.<br />
<br />
Idk why don't you give a fancy pet to every player every full year of subscription ? That's a way to reward ! Why don't you grant a big price reduction for a limited time period for people who subscribed a full year ?<br />
There are many many ways to reward players who pay, if you want to. Removing content is rewarding them while punishing the others when there are so many other ways to do that without punishing...<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I have the legendary cloak, I finished the quest pretty early actually, but I have been so much in the position where I can't afford WoW, or I have IRL problems that prevent me from playing, and I have been already &quot;punished&quot; so many times for that (anniversary pets, old mounts, etc.), I don't like when Blizzard removes content, because taht's something new players may want to be able to do, get the legendary item from an Xpac, and now this one will be impossible to get.<br />
I was happy to be able to get the legendary axe with my tank, and the legendary staff with my mage, I think a lot of people would have been happy to be able to get the cloak, even if it doesn't grant them any advantage in battle, it will be a collection object in the future...</div></div><hr />

They want to reward players who sub every month with a cloak players already obtained? How about upgrading cloak to lvl100, or, at least, letting us transmog its visual effect over new cloaks? Liars.</div></div><hr />

Wrong, a lot of people cared. There were many people who were midway on the Atiesh quest lines that never were allowed/able to complete it and is still a sore subject with many.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure the 1-2 people that are around from back then, actually started the questline and still play today care about it. Anyone else? Doubtful.<br />

You know what the funniest part about the removal of the legendary cloak is? Because the total number of cloaks gained will stop at the end of the expansion and with WoD, stat squish and attack/defense value scaling percentage on top of certain fights being &quot;fixed&quot; to be soloable in WoD, this cloak may actually end up being more rare than the other legendaries that are still around.<br />
<br />
Think about it. Once WoD hits it's going to be easier for people to farm all the old raids, so although the drop chance is admittedly low you have form now until the end of WoW to get it so technically (though unlikely to happen) if everyone wanted it, they could and would eventually get one, becoming far more common than the cloaks.</div></div><hr />

There aren't many unique quests in the game, I sure would love to do the Atiesh quest even if it's super old and easy to get. I love reading the texts and seeing the special events when you work on a Legendary for example. Shame you can't anymore :(</div></div><hr />

Progress is reset at the start of every expansion pack. 10 years or 1 year makes ZERO difference in terms of anything meaningful. In 2 months, you wont be able to tell veterans from new players gear wise. This is a completely moot point.<br />
<br />
I seriously don't think that they're going to start giving people stat boosts for being consistantly subscribed, that would be fucking stupid. I mean I'm subscribed almost consistantly and I still think that would be stupid. It would mean players are not better due to skill, but by paying for an arbitary stat increase.</div></div><hr />

WoW is your first MMORPG I guess? BTW: Path of Titans would have been a similar system. WoW hardly gets new players - only manages old players to come back from time to time. Having a system like that (and like many other MMORPGs before WoW had and EVE Online still has) would encourage existing players to keep the sub running and would be a little but noticeable reward for long term players. It's not stupid now. It would have been stupid until Cataclysm when subs where constantly rising and new players came in all the time. Since Catacysm the subs are on a constant decline. Even the release of MoP only managed to get about 800k subs back and lost them in the following months. Right now the task is different. It's to keep players from leaving and getting rewards for not leaving is one way to do that.</div></div><hr />

Still too good as it seems. Or in other words, they kindly leave us an ability to cast while moving, it's just that it'll be a damage loss nonetheless to keep it in line with other classes / specs. I'm still overwhelmed they didn't disable Heating Up / Pyroblast! procs from Scorch yet.<br />

THESE FURY CHANGES... :****D Blizzard listened to the cry's of the true warriors out there and are fixing us.Thank you Blizzard.<br />
I doubt it had something to do with whining. They would have brought these changes anyway sooner or later, however not everything is being worked on strictly simultaneously and so this got in a bit later than other tunes.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW is your first MMORPG I guess? BTW: Path of Titans would have been a similar system. WoW hardly gets new players - only manages old players to come back from time to time. Having a system like that (and like many other MMORPGs before WoW had and EVE Online still has) would encourage existing players to keep the sub running and would be a little but noticeable reward for long term players. It's not stupid now. It would have been stupid until Cataclysm when subs where constantly rising and new players came in all the time. Since Catacysm the subs are on a constant decline. Even the release of MoP only managed to get about 800k subs back and lost them in the following months. Right now the task is different. It's to keep players from leaving and getting rewards for not leaving is one way to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh I assumed you were complaining about Timeless Isle or something asinine, nevermind.<br />
<br />
Yes, WoW was technically my first MMO, I've been here almost since day 1. Path of the titans was not a similar system, it was merely a different form of the same progression system that gear uses. You still had to persue it, you wern't given it purely by having thrown money at Blizzard for so many years. It didn't make players that had played for more years innately better than ones who had just joined wheras extra stats for veterancy would mean newer players could NEVER be as good as veteran players as far as stats were concerned. Which is rediculous. Balance? Nah fuck that: &quot;I'm in as good gear as this guy, and I'm as skilled, but he's still innately better than me!&quot; People would be seriously PISSED. &quot;Oh well, you started playing in Mists? Well I started in Vanilla, so you'll never be as good as me, fucking suck it you little nooblet!&quot; You can catch up with gear if you put the effort in, you'd NEVER catch up with veterancy.<br />
<br />
Older MMOs may well have used those systems, but they also used gear, exp and level loss, with the exception of EVE, which is a /very/ niche game, those systems all went the way of the dodo, because they have no place or desire to most people in the current landscape. <br />
<br />
And it still would be stupid, WoW may be in decline, but so what? It's still got more players than the other &quot;big&quot; MMos combined. And you know most of them wont make it past a few years without going free 2 play or being shut down completely. Wow may be in decline, but I guarentee it'd piss off a larger portion of it's player base than it'd appease. You'd suddenly have a whole new table of ability that you could never effect or catch up. &quot;LFM SoO, ilvl 570, 10 year players only!&quot;</div></div><hr />

If you get a permanent stat boost like that it would utterly destroy the concept of a new expansion as a reset. To take your earlier comparison to D3, expansions are now more like seasons, and that's how it should be in an MMO.<br />
<br />
I've played since the start, and having stuff like the original Quel'Serrar, Benediction, T0.5 set, now unobtainable titles, Dark Portal tabard etc. is reward enough. I am pretty sure no real veteran player would feel the need of a pay-to-win stat.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, those are our rewards, no one will ever be able to get stuff like that ever again. The memories, opening of An Quiraj? Awe-some in the full sense of the word, once in a life time experience, never gonna happen again, nor will anything like it. Zombie Invasion? Fucking great, bundled with now unobtainable Blue Judgement, a tabard and the FUN. The FUN we had and still have playing, people seem to forget that one. Frankly my most treasured now unobtainable items are a complete set of Brewfest Mugs :)</div></div><hr />

Indeed I remember back then people were disapointed about it. Acctually about the removal of naxx 60 as well. Even nowadays you can still find posts about people asking for they to bring it back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also loved the comment of the blue making jokes about giving stuff to people subscribed. I keep my swtor sub because they give stuff out, even when i am not playing (minor things most of the time but still nice that they reconize people playing their game). No reason to do the same with wow. Personally i would only sub wow again if i intended to play in that moment. Sucks for them I supose.</div></div><hr />
