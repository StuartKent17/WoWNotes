Valley of the Four Winds Zone Preview<br />
Important - The zone is incomplete and not intended to be played through yet. This preview represents unfinished work and will see significant changes the future. There are many placeholders and missing mobs in the zone.<br />
<br />
One of the more interesting NPCs that we came across was Farmer Fung (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/VotFW032.jpg), who may be associated with the new Tillers daily quest farm. Jogu the drunk appears to sell tips (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/VotFW031.jpg) on tomorrow's crops for 10 gold. We even came across Hemet Nesingwary and Hemet Nesingwary Jr! <br />

New Quest Icons<br />
Mists of Pandaria brought us some small improvements to make questing less frustrating. Quests which require you to speak to an NPC or interact with an object now have nice icons above them and on the minimap, making them easier to spot. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/thumb/questIcons.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/questIcons.jpg) <br />
<br />
Quest icons also appear on both the Zone Map and World Map in a limted radius around you, making it easier for you to find the next quest. This will be especially helpful for those of you who want to complete The Loremaster (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1682) achievements!<br />

No, which makes me curious how Blizzard is working the beta...and the real beta. I'm guessing special limited content access beta servers for AP owners, which explains why we can't ticket bugs in game, and don't receive survey requests etc, etc as well as the fact that we don't have access to new content that is being released and previewed on fan sites. My little QQ, oh well. At least I made it in during one of the later waves, so I am still seeing some of the new cool stuff.</div></div><hr />

Sod the stats look at the stupid name: &quot;5.0 Dungeon - Levelup - Stormstout Brewery - Boss 3 Loot 1 - Agi Gun&quot; no way am I playing a game with item names like that. <br />

<br />
Beta is actually the best time to address things that need to change. Otherwise, how would anyone know to change them before it goes live? So what do you think the purpose of beta is if not to report what you believe to be errors?<br />
<br />
And to be honest, I think the DPS on the weapon is likely going to be close to that for live. As I'm writing this I noted two of the items I got from Jade Temple, which were previously &quot;&quot;5.0 Dungeon - Levelup - The Jade Temple - Boss x Loot x - Agi xxx&quot; were just changed from AiL 425 to AiL 410 and have real names now. The DPS for my 410 gun is 2,005, so Brewery will probably be somewhere between 410 and 425 or 2000 and 2300 DPS on the final version.<br />
<br />
Firebelcher Hand Cannon is the gun with 2005 DPS<br />
Hopecrusher Gauntlets. which have 408 agi/611 stam</div></div><hr />

Weapon Damage was increased while abilities based on weapon damage were reduced going into the Beta. This was done to mitigate issues with scaling, especially at low level. While some abilities have been modified since for balancing reasons, at the time the conversion was made there was actually no net change in damage despite the increase in weapon damage.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to say you aren't correct about these being the original test servers. What I doubt however is that MMOC is using an 'exploit' and brazenly posting a video on their home page confirming that they are exploiting. I honestly don't believe MMOC would be posting exploit video, but maybe that's just me being Naive. I believe they have the full support of Blizzard being in that dungeon.<br />
<br />
Whether or not that means MMOC testers are on a newer or different server or just that their test accounts have been flagged for special access, who knows...</div></div><hr />

I've seen the MMOC streamers on Mekkatorque and I believe my brother grouped with them once or twice, so they're definitely on the same server as everyone else. The only thing I can think of is that you can bug into the zone where the dungeon is physically located and then enter it in the old fashioned way, or that they're playing in Bibi's sandbox. Not sure if the latter would work, but I thought I'd mention it anyway.</div></div><hr />

Wheres the bragging rights to finding that secret hidden quest which gave a funny looking staff and only a few people have it etc Blizzard just lost -50 reputation with the Wayne25uk Clan.<br />
<br />
Firstly, if you're reffering to the dungeon, it's the normal version of it in Beta, what would you expect? If you're talking about quests, well, you know what happened to secret hidden quests? They never existed. Aslong as there's internet nothing is secret or hidden. I prefer funny and straightforward questing over clueless questing where I have to find some old man's wife. There never was any challenge in questing aslong as sites like Wowhead and Thotbot existed, and if you didn't use those sites all the quests were like 'Kill 30 of these guys' anyways. There never were any bragging rights (bragging is for scumbags btw) about quests, those always resided in raids and achievements. Also, I don't think Blizzard cares about their reputation with the ''Wayne25uk'' clan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because blizzard DOESN'T want any content that only a few people experience. its the main reason for things like LFR.<br />
<br />
and another thing, when are we gonna get around to destroying nesingwary and his kid? I am sick of him and his weak-arse quests.</div></div><hr />

It's Beta. Grow up. Number's aren't finalised yet. Good god, literally anything to complain about...<br />
<br />
I know it's Beta, but the stat jump is just ridiculous... Even for a Beta version of a game... And no need to act all though on the Internets Mister.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hopefully some day you'll look back and think &quot;man i was ignorant at that age&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
if you think you could balance 40 separate tiers of 3 choices of talents AND keep each talent interesting and not just fluff, you should be working for NASA or something. Or you need your head examined.<br />
<br />
right now with 6 talent tiers of 3 choices they have 3^6 = 729 different ways to spec your talents<br />
<br />
if they have 40 talent points that you want.. that would mean 40 rows of 3 choices... <br />
<br />
so you're asking for 3^40 = 12,157,665,459,056,928,801 different ways to spec your character, that is impossible to balance (obviously). <br />
<br />
i really hope i dont have to explain any further why your problem with &quot;too few talent points&quot; is ridiculous<br />
<br />
also think about this. they have to consider future expansions. Say in the lvl 90-95 expansion they add another tier. That's 3^7 = 2187 different possible talent specs they have to try to balance. <br />
<br />
Personally i don't believe they'll even be able to pull that off and will have to redo talents again somehow.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i guess what im sayin is, think before you post, or read a book or something.<br />
<br />
edit: btw that's 729 possible talent specs PER CLASS... and they have to balance 11 classes somehow, that's 8019 talent specs in the entire game, shit like that doesn't get handled overnight,</div></div><hr />

What a shameful post. I'm not even biased since i quit Wow 1 year ago so i CBA, but really ? You seem to hate this game since early Cata, literally everything you mention post-WOTLK is bad in your opinion. Then you ask people to stop beeing sheeps and follow Blizzard ? Son, if Wow has +8m suscribers still its for a good reason : because Wow is a damm good game. Have your opinions, yes, but dont try to shove them into other people's throat.<br />

Of course they care you tool,where do you think they buy their Nerf bats from? It certainly isnt cheap to make those things,and ever since i started making ban hammers they always come to me,so if they want good deals they better keep that rep up boyo!</div></div><hr />
