Patch 4.3 Raid Preview: Dragon Soul<br />
World of Warcraft patch 4.3 will offer players the opportunity to take the fight to Wyrmrest Temple and beyond, assisting Thrall and the Dragon Aspects as they seek to bring an end to the Black Dragonflight once and for all. 10- and 25-person raids will get to take on Deathwing himself, with three levels of difficulty to consider and epic gear to claim.<br />
<br />
Forged by Deathwing during the War of the Ancients, the Dragon Soul harnessed the power of the other dragonflights, until it was ultimately destroyed. After recovering a version of the artifact from the Caverns of Time, Thrall and the allied dragonflights now rally at Wyrmrest Temple in a desperate bid to use its might to defeat Deathwing.<br />
<br />
Created by the titans as a sanctuary for all Dragonkind, the crumbling Wyrmrest Temple is now the final hope for the forces allied against the black dragon Neltharion, once the Earth-Warder and protector of Azeroth, now Deathwing the Destroyer. It is here that the remaining aspects -- Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, Kalecgos, and Thrall -- have gathered to empower the Dragon Soul -- Azeroth's last chance to stop the great behemoth. As they begin to charge the Dragon Soul with energy, Deathwing and his entire army assault Wyrmrest Temple. Players must thwart the attacking forces long enough for Thrall to charge the Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />
Before you face Deathwing the Destroyer, you must prevail against six mighty bosses.<br />
<br />
The most powerful elemental still under Deathwing's sway, Morchok -- once a passive guardian -- is now convinced that his only respite will come with Azeroth's demise. Morchok rages against the foundation of Wyrmrest Temple, Azeroth's last beacon of hope in the Hour of Twilight.<br />
<br />
Countless ages ago, Warlord Zon'ozz and his soldiers waged endless war against the forces of C'Thun and Yogg-Saron. Millennia have passed, but the warlord still serves the chaotic might of the Old God N'Zoth. Deathwing has now unleashed this legendary faceless one to crush the defenders of Wyrmrest Temple.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Since the fall of the Bastion of Twilight, Yor'sahj the Unsleeping has eagerly assisted Deathwing, providing the Destroyer with the means to release more faceless ones from their prisons deep beneath the earth. Their numbers are endless and their power is beyond reckoning, and Yor'sahj intends to reap a grim reward for his faithful service.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hagara the Binder, one of the first students of arcane magic under the Forsaken, showed surprising potential for one who had started learning so late in life. But in her undisciplined attempts to bind elementals into servitude, she was ensnared and twisted by the Windlord, Al'Akir. Now fiercely loyal to the Twilight's Hammer, Hagara binds others for her elemental masters to torment.<br />
<br />
More an abomination of dark energy than a dragon, Ultraxion has spent his short life absorbing the essence of captured nether dragons. Ultraxion is the only twilight dragon Deathwing has praised, and his arrogance is overshadowed only by the crackling energies surging through his twisted form. Loyal to his master, Ultraxion swears to bring about the fall of Wyrmrest Temple.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Though once vast in number, only a few dozen twilight dragons now remain. Astride these hardened survivors are the last vestiges of the Twilight's Hammer's army: the elite drake riders of Deathwing's personal escort. Led by the insidious Warmaster Blackhorn, they move with unholy purpose, driven to protect their dark master.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
When Deathwing first channeled the Dragon Soul's power against the other dragonflights, the massive energies that he unleashed threatened to break him apart. Rather than forgo this weapon, he had adamantium plates fused to his scales to hold his body together. Later reinforced with elementium, these plates are now his weakness -- the sole vulnerability to Deathwing's lethal presence.<br />
<br />
Your assault on the massive Deathwing will begin a battle unlike any other. It is a fight so wide-ranging and intense that it comprises two unique encounters, taking place across Azeroth. Taking to the skies, players will parachute from soaring gunships to attack the monster mid-flight and attempt to weaken him by ripping away his armor, exposing the molten flesh beneath. Should they succeed, they will plunge into the depths of Maelstrom for the final encounter.<br />
<br />
No adventurer has yet taken on an enemy so large and dangerous and lived to tell the tale. Will you?<br />
<br />

Transmogrification Rules<br />
Since we announced the transmogrification feature coming to World of Warcraft with patch 4.3, we have monitored thousands of follow-up comments, questions and suggestions from players all over the world.<br />
<br />
What follows is our current list of rules for transmogrification. This is a set of rules that we expect to change over time, and is not intended to be 100% comprehensive, but we hope that it can be referenced to answer most questions that players currently have about what they can and cannot expect to be able to do with transmogrification.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The character must be able to equip both items.<br />
Only uncommon (green), rare (blue) or epic (purple) items may be transmogrified. (exceptions: a select few of these items will prevented from being used to transmogrify if they are inappropriate)<br />
Items must share the same armor type (examples: plate for plate, cloth for cloth)<br />
Weapons must be the same weapon type (exceptions: Guns, Crossbows, or Bows)<br />
Guns, Crossbows, and Bows can be used to transmogrify Guns, Crossbows, or Bows.<br />
Main hand weapons can only be used to transmogrify Main hand weapons.<br />
Off-hand weapons can only be used to transmogrify Off-hand weapons.<br />
One handed weapons can be used to transmogrify a Main hand or Off-hand weapon.<br />
Using an item for transmogrify makes it soulbound.<br />
Using an item for transmogrify makes it non-refundable.<br />
Using an item for transmogrify makes it non-tradable.<br />
Heirlooms and Account Bound items can be transmogrified.<br />
Heirlooms and Account Bound items can be used to transmogrify.<br />
Legendary items cannot be transmogrified.<br />
Legendary items cannot be used to transmogrify.<br />
Fishing Poles cannot be transmogrified.<br />
Fishing Poles cannot be used to transmogrify.<br />
Mailing an item strips its transmogrification.<br />
Placing an item in Void Storage strips its transmogrification.<br />
Vendoring an item strips its transmogrification.<br />
The displayed enchant will be that of the currently equipped item.<br />
There may be individual items that are excluded from being transmogrified on the basis that they were originally added to the game as absurdities. (examples: a weapon that looks like a fish, or a chest piece that is invisible)</div></div><hr />

I mean, that does make sense. They're beings of chaos. Some lore sources say they enslaved the elementals and made them fight anything that moved, including each other. The implication being that it was just for the hell of it.<br />

<br />
Not really, notice that when they state the aspecs they sepparate each one with a comma, but when they mention Thrall they use a comma and &quot;and&quot;, which is a bit reduntant, used when you finished enumerating a list of nouns and continued with another subject. so no, i dont think that is evidence of thrall being an aspect.<br />

<br />
this is the actual line:<br />
<br />
&quot;It is here that the remaining aspects -- Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, Kalecgos, and Thrall -- have gathered to empower the Dragon Soul -- Azeroth's last chance to stop the great behemoth.&quot;<br />
<br />
In my opinion, they included thrall in the same hyphens to say that he, alongside with the dragons, is gatheres to empower the dragon soul (on his role of azeroth's shaman). That is why they useb both comma and &quot;and&quot;. <br />
<br />
But hey, i could be wrong, Thrall can really become an aspect. Its blizzard, its not unlike of them to do crazy thinks. Its just not too likely.</div></div><hr />

I just hope they come up with some &quot;Unique&quot; models for those left.<br />
<br />
INB4 Hagara is a Generic undead male/female on warlock set and Morchok being some generic elemental... Would be a sad day, seeing there is 0 new models at the moment on the last raid of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the actual quote. It strongly implies Thrall is included in the &quot;Aspects&quot; category now.<br />
<br />
Considering there's a comma before &quot;and Thrall&quot;, I doubt he's included in the aspects, but the double dashes condratict that. Then again the double dashes are used weirdly anyway /shrug.<br />
<br />
As for the boss models, kinda sad there aren't new ones (unless they are placeholders), but hey, you can't expect members of the same race, be it a faceless or a dragon, to have way different features than others, now can you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just as he had exchanged his armor for robes in order to<br />
fight another sort of battle—one to calm and heal the earth<br />
—Thrall realized he had exchanged his ability to help as an<br />
individual for something far greater. He was not, could<br />
never be, an Aspect. But he was what helped bind them<br />
together, to do what they needed to.<br />

Whether there's a comma before it or not is grammatically correct either way and sort of implies the same thing. I think it's an absolutely crazy idea and would like more of an explanation, but it seems to be what they're saying... Maybe he's like a temporary aspect substitute or it's somehow a necessary step to use the Dragon Soul.</div></div><hr />

Legendaries are legendary, and if you have them from when they were current content, or if you have had the patience and dedication to grind the raids every week since then to get them, why shouldn't you be allowed to show them off? And as for the straw man argument that &quot;zomg everyone will have legendaries,&quot; it's simply not true. If I remember correctly, the most wide spread legendary is the TF, and it's still only like 3% of the population that has it. If you think 3% is &quot;everyone,&quot; then I don't know what to tell you.</div></div><hr />

Patch 4.3 new content is really awesome, it is going to be so fun, and I'm trully excited to experience all of it. But when I see those bosses models makes me wonder if Blizzard has reached its limits of creativity. It's ok if Blizz intend to use Twilight Dragons because it goes with the lore and stuff, but even with that limitation Blizzard is capable of making bad ass models for them, I think. Seeing this bosses is like going back to Grim Batol or even Trone of the Tides, so boring. And that Ultraxion just seems like Theralion in a very stressful day, nothing really new. Come on Blizz, I know u can do better than this, I have seen it before.</div></div><hr />

Why is it surprising that creatures that enjoy chaos, destruction and death would willingly fight each other? <br />

Isn't Chromatus dead?<br />
<br />
No, he's just inanimate. <br />
<br />
From the wowpedia <br />
Concerned that some other dark power might try to revive Chromatus after its defeat, the dragons had attempted to destroy the corpse. They had failed. Some powerful spell, probably woven into the dark marriage of magic and technology that had animated him in the first place protected the body from all their efforts to obliterate it. Kalecgos stated that Malygos created a number of Arcane Prisons during the Nexus War, and Alexstrasza decided that representatives from all the flights will watch over the body of Chromatus, as he is not dead.</div></div><hr />

Its been that way forever. Sunwell's bosses were never mentioned beforehand, bar maybe in Quel'Danas quests or Magister's Terrace.<br />

Personally I'm thrilled to bits at this. So long as it doesn't become Hyjal 2.0 with waves and waves and waves of trash that respawn after every wipe.

You have to have someone filling in for the Black Dragonflight, who are in charge of the Earth. Who better than the world's most powerful Shaman?

You have to have someone filling in for the Black Dragonflight, who are in charge of the Earth. Who better than the world's most powerful Shaman? I wouldn't be at all surprised to find once Deathwing dies, there's a cinematic or cutscene of Thrall being changed into a pure Black Dragon (with hints of green of course) to once again unite the 5 Flights. <br />

There's already another uncorrupted black dragon, he's the one giving rogues their shiny legendaries.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever stopped to consider that maybe NPCs that don't have chest pieces are actually topless, and don't feel they need chest armor? In many forms of combat, armor is restrictive and impedes the skills of the combatant. So go ahead and try to justify it all you like, but WoW classes all utilize chests for either armor or stat augmenting purposes. To forsake that piece of armor is to not achieve your maximum potential. In short, no invisible chest for you! Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, that's also possible. But it still doesn't change the fact that the sentence was badly worded. :) In some ways, if that is what they were going for, it makes the original sentence even worse from a clarity point of view.<br />

<br />
Yup and I considered that. But if you read the details, he's not exactly letting the other Aspects know he's around, what with the slinking in the shadows and staying alone bit. Not exactly a very good candidate for becoming a Black Dragonflight Aspect, especially considering his extreme youth and inexperience in dragon terms.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scratches</div><div class="date">2011-09-20, 03:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not really, notice that when they state the aspecs they sepparate each one with a comma, but when they mention Thrall they use a comma and &quot;and&quot;, which is a bit reduntant, used when you finished enumerating a list of nouns and continued with another subject. so no, i dont think that is evidence of thrall being an aspect.<br />
<br />
this is the actual line:<br />
<br />
&quot;It is here that the remaining aspects -- Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, Kalecgos, and Thrall -- have gathered to empower the Dragon Soul -- Azeroth's last chance to stop the great behemoth.&quot;<br />
<br />
In my opinion, they included thrall in the same hyphens to say that he, alongside with the dragons, is gatheres to empower the dragon soul (on his role of azeroth's shaman). That is why they useb both comma and &quot;and&quot;. <br />
<br />
Considering there's a comma before &quot;and Thrall&quot;, I doubt he's included in the aspects, but the double dashes condratict that. Then again the double dashes are used weirdly anyway /shrug.<br />
<br />
Wow, for speaking the language you guys sure don't know your grammar. ;)<br />
<br />
It's called an Oxford comma, which is standard fare for Chicago-style writing, and, in this idiot's (me) not-so-humble opinion, is the only way to do it -- leaving that comma out just makes things look so unprofessional, lol.<br />
<br />
I won't disagree that it's some very poor wording from whoever wrote it, but it's not the grammar's fault.<br />
<br />
It is here that the remaining Aspects -- Alexstrasza, Ysera, Nozdormu, Kalecgos, and Thrall -- have gathered[...] <br />
Here, the double hyphens (pseudo-em dashes) are used to demarcate an appositive phrase; in this case, the names of the referenced Aspects -- complete with an Oxford comma, and the implication that Thrall is (or will be) an Aspect! lol<br />
<br />
[...]to empower the Dragon Soul -- Azeroth's last chance to stop the great behemoth. <br />
And here, another &quot;em dash&quot; is used to demarcate a parenthetical phrase (subordinate clause), which further describes the Dragon (Demon?) Soul.<br />
<br />
Also, while not uncommon in American writing, it's generally considered bad form to use more than one subordinate clause (which both entries above are examples of) in any given sentence, as it can quickly lead to confused readers -- and as you add more clauses or parenthetical phrases (and nested phrases) beyond that, the rate of confusion begins to grow exponentially. See? lol<br />
I should know; I'm guilty of this faux pas more often than I'd care to admit... (but I love my writing to sound intelligent and--resultantly convoluted! lol)<br />
<br />
And this has been your English lesson for the week.<br />

Benedictus is a boss for the last 5 man dungeon before Demonsoul Raid. I think Blizzard should made Benedictus and the Dark Mage be like the Twins Emperor for Demonsoul raid. <br />
<br />
Chromatus is lock up thank to the Blue dragonflight creating the arcane prison during the Nexus War. There have to some ways for the Twilight Hammer to find where the prison is at in order to turn him back on.<br />

I am shock and happy that I was right about Nerubian do attack Old Gods, and the only one that can control them is C'Thun. The biggest question I have is what happen if Nerubian do meet C'Thun again?</div></div><hr />

It is how each of the dragonflight were killed.<br />
<br />
Alexstrasza was killed by her dragonflight's special power, a tree wrap her around and crush her. (i think i mess up that death.)<br />

Nozdormu is frozen in time dead.<br />

Ok I guess that makes sense in order to prevent people from &quot;Need to transmogrify&quot;. <br />
Only uncommon (green), rare (blue) or epic (purple) items may be transmogrified. (exceptions: a select few of these items will prevented from being used to transmogrify if they are inappropriate) Why restrict white and grey items? an option to make your character look like a complete noob hobo and then smashing in faces of those who expect an easy prey is pretty worthwhile IMO. <br />
Weapons must be the same weapon type (exceptions: Guns, Crossbows, or Bows) Same as first. Would be odd to see a mage wielding a spear which is a transmogrified staff. <br />
Main hand weapons can only be used to transmogrify Main hand weapons. <br />
Off-hand weapons can only be used to transmogrify Off-hand weapons. Useless IMO. I cant think of any game breaking mechanic or abuse to see a cool offhand to be in mainhand. <br />
Legendary items cannot be transmogrified. Legendary items cannot be used to transmogrify. Big FU Blizzard! why? <br />
Mailing an item strips its transmogrification. Another FU! <br />
There may be individual items that are excluded from being transmogrified on the basis that they were originally added to the game as absurdities. (examples: a weapon that looks like a fish, or a chest piece that is invisible) People would dare to look dopy and stupid. So what? Seriously so what?

what sparked the conversation about chromatus...<br />
<br />
What sparked it is the complete lack of him in the final raid... which is strange considering they made a REALLY big deal about him in the novel Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects. He was defeated, but they made it VERY clear he was only subdued and was locked away. <br />
<br />
For history, Chromatus is the &quot;final&quot; Chromatic dragon experiment by Nefarian - a 5 headed dragon that took the power of all the aspects to defeat in the novel. <br />
<br />
Looking at the complete lack of nearly any original models for the entire raid (aside from an armored Twilight Dragon), I'm inclined to think Blizzard simply decided to not include Chromatus in favor of spitting this last dungeon out as fast as possible to get this expansion over and done with.</div></div><hr />

...how do you know that any of the dungeons are going to be similiar to Violet Hold or Black Morass? THEY HAVEN'T TOLD US AT ALL ABOUT THE FIGHTS.

Reason: You did the quest (obviously as you got it) means you got it, so I dont see why not making them avaliable to this feature, It would atleast take players like me back to actually do the old content again on alts to obtain them for flavour and not just obtain them and put them in the bank, and I know many rogues and warriors want to use the Warglaives once again, so this feels to me like old legendaries are crap to put in bank but old epic models can be reused making them more valuable, so what makes it so unfair to make legendaries reused? They dont want a whole raid have models that will look like legendaries? If all of them put the effort to do it, why not? Who does it hurt? As I see it as the moment, legendaries are in the afk in orgrimmar set wich non actually care about. Legendaries last 1 content no more then it goes to bank. I myself im a paladin tank so I dont bother that much, but I just want to state my opinion on these &quot;rules&quot;.

Why they didnt add Chromatus as a boss - to replace one of those shitty nasty drakes - it would be 100 times coolerLook, if we killed Chromatus we wouldn't have any powerful evil dragons left to fill in after Deathwing is dead. And what evil dragons we did have left would pale in comparison to the Aspects and be insignificant because of that.<br />
<br />
With Chromatus Blizzard has the ability to bring up a convincing draconic threat that they won't have to pull out of their asses. In other words, Chromatus will be the new Deathwing.</div></div><hr />

Atleast put them to some use, they are worthless and they are'nt put to any use so they could might aswell make them gray<br />

This exactly. Or a later introduction as a Heroic Only boss. <br />

And to all the people crying over the Transmog &quot;rules&quot;, are you ignoring the fact that these are &quot;for now&quot; rules that may change or be altered later?

Yeah, if you'd like your bloodied arcarnite reaper to look like a sharpened stone on a stick. I think the point was that he would like his level 1 warrior to look like t12-character.

Very disappointed on one rule for this new transmogrify, the armor type rule. I have some mail sets, there is no plate prior to 40, that look fantastic and wanted to apply their skins to current armor (go look at what battleforge armors look like - banded is another but not on par with battleforge). I have all the pieces and now it looks like I won't be able to use it on my characters current armor.<br />
<br />
Complain on the official forums. No seriously, do. Blizzard said that these are the initial rules and that they will be looking at other ides to modify restrictions, the more people complain about thinks like what you're saying and the fact that i have to change my weapon when i get a new weapon type the more likely they are to change it.<br />

All in all this is looking good, i'm just hoping Blizzard doesn't get carried away with what they deem to &quot;look acceptable&quot;. Agreed. I really feel &quot;if its too 'silly' for your game why does it exist in the first place&quot;? IE they should have thought about it when they added it, not 5 years later.</div></div><hr />

Would be odd to see a mage wielding a spear which is a transmogrified staff. Useless IMO. I cant think of any game breaking mechanic or abuse to see a cool offhand to be in mainhand.

I guess your right. It's not like that we have every ret/arms/blood/unholy walking with Jeklik's Smasher. Oh wait...<br />
<br />
Did you ever read something said about transmogrif?<br />
<br />
For example, their reason about main-hand/off-hand is because some weapon models were created as main-hand or off-hand only and using the off-hand model as main-hand would not fit the main-hand place correctly. Not all 1-handers were created as both &quot;main-hand/off-hand perfect match&quot; model.<br />
<br />
Altough not usable (for now), the Warglaives set is one of the most well know weapons that if you use the main-hand as off-hand (and vice-versa), it will be glitched since they were done to only show correctly on their matching hands. There are usable models (for this release) that will have the same problem. I guess nobody here wants Blizzard wasting time, of what is left of their dev team still working in WoW, re-doing those models to show correctly in the other hand.<br />

Actually I think that since they're removing Deathwing from the board and beginning the redemption of the Black Dragonflight they may actually have created Chromatus to be his replacement as the Anti-aspect and new source and ruler of evil dragons everywhere.<br />
<br />
Edit: In other words, he's like how they set up Bolvar just in case they ever wanted to reuse the Lich King idea. Only he's a huge evil dragon instead.<br />
<br />

Legendaries shouldn't even be mentionned,how legendary is an item if you can reuse it again and again it was most obvious they weren't going to be available and once again certain managed to complain about it and prove me sadly that some people aren't intellectually mature.</div></div><hr />

Millennia have passed, but the warlord still serves the chaotic might of the Old God N'Zoth. Deathwing has now unleashed this legendary faceless one to crush the defenders of Wyrmrest Temple.<br />
<br />
Wait what?? The Old Gods were fighting against themselves in the past??<br />
<br />
Didn't you read the lore? The Old Gods used Azeroth as their staging ground with the elementals fighting serving as their armies. This is why they were chained.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just what is &quot;intellectually immature&quot; about thinking that legendaries should be available as transmogrification sources?<br />
<br />
They're the hardest items to acquire, but they're completely useless as soon as the content ends. It doesn't even make sense lore-wise for a rogue who killed Illidan and took his warglaives to ever use any other weapons, especially not some blue piece of crap. For game balance reasons, legendaries can't scale with level, but their appearance should most certainly be available for use if you've already earned them.</div></div><hr />

One man's clown is another man's artist. I don't think it's wrong for being suspicious of Blizzard, of all companies, and owner of WoW, of all games, deciding what is &quot;mature&quot;, not least when you consider all the &quot;mature&quot; things they've done in the game.</div></div><hr />

Becouse hunters get an exception on this. Sounds incredibly bullshitty to me, and very unfair. So lets say a hunter got this gun, and he wants it to look like a bow then that's fine, while if I want to make my axe look like an awesome sword I can't do that. That means since I am currently using an axe I can't mog it to look like for example the Hammer of the Naaru wich matches paladin T5 really well. I would have to find some axe to go with it. And what if no fitting axe exist? Thats bullshit. If it's going to be like that for us, then if a hunter wants his gun to look different then he should very well get a darn gun to mog it with! Naturally plate shouldnt be able to look like cloth and vice versa, but I dont see what's the problem with weapons of the same type, meaning /1h/2h/ranged etc.<br />
<br />
It just...doesnt make any sense to me. Why make the exception? What makes hunters so special? Am I missing something here?<br />

I'd imagine it's the fact that there are way fewer ranged weapons available in each tier of content compared to melee weapons of all types.</div></div><hr />

Could be...could be. But it still sounds a little dodgy. I also feel like a lot of the fun is pulled out of mogging by forcing you to stick to the same weapon types. It's going to annoy the hell out of me. Am I being selfish?</div></div><hr />

It's been a few months since I last played, but this feature initially sounded like the type of thing that would draw me back in (I love dressing up my dollies). If I can't transmogrify the cloth and leather pieces of my Dwarf hunter's mountaineer set on to mail armor, or the cloth bits of my rogue's Bloodsail set on to leather armor, then I have next to no interest in the feature. I wish Blizzard would worry more about immersion and &quot;coolness&quot; when structuring their world and quest content than they seem to when structuring customization and designing gear. As if any piece of gear existing in the game today could look 1/100th as stupid as the Blizzcon bear mount...</div></div><hr />

I managed to put together a pretty decent Ironforge guard out of only mail for my dwarf as well as a mail deathguard set for undead hunter. <br />

The hood for mountaineers would be a bit hard though. you'd have to go for a chainmail type hood and find a matching cloak. Special branch of t mountaineers?</div></div><hr />
