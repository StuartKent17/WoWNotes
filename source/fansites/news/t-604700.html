<br />
Notes about the class changes list<br />
A longer explanation might get the attention of most of the users. The list posted yesterday IS NOT from the patch notes, it's more than likely a leak from an internal mail/meeting discussing potential changes for classes. 90% of them probably won't be in the initial release of the 2.4 Patch on PTRs and even if they're added later, keep in mind that you'll be playing on a TEST server used to ... test changes and see how it works with enough people to gather an accurate feedback. <br />
<br />
<br />
Spell haste and Global Cooldown<br />
In 2.4, Spell haste will let you decrease your global cooldown, Nethaera explains how efficient it will be.<br />
With haste gear you can work toward lowering the GCD down to 1 second, but it will take more than just gear to max it. <br />
You can max it with the use of both haste on gear and abilities/talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid UI changes in 2.4<br />
Another feature has been added to the raid UI in 2.4<br />
The Raid UI now can display the range of players relative to you. The option to enable this is in the Party &amp; Raid section of the UI Options.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzcast Episode 2<br />
The Episode 2 of the Blizzcast is currently in post-production and will probably be released in the the upcoming weeks. Bornakk reminds people that you won't necessarily see tons of new things here.<br />
<br />
If you missed the first Episode you can download it here (http://us.media.blizzard.com/blizzcast/blizzcast_episode1.mp3) or just check its page (http://us.blizzard.com/blizzcast/archive/episode1.xml) on the official site for a transcript/stream.<br />
And to build off what was said, the tag line at the top of the official BlizzCast page is &quot;Taking you deeper into the world of Blizzard.&quot; While new game/content information might be discussed from time to time, that isn't the primary goal. Instead we want to bring some unique perspectives to the variety of aspects involved in making games and our company in general.<br />
<br />
<br />
2.4 Potential class changes<br />
Read this first<br />
It's unconfirmed and potentially fake (50% chance I'd say)<br />
Most of these changes won't be in the initial release of the 2.4 Patch on PTR, it's more a todo-list for classes changes than a full list of changes at the release.<br />
According to the source, they're a list of changes that Blizzard will like to experiment on the PTRs. You won't see them in patch notes until Blizzard decides or not to test them on a PTR build. That's why they're called TEST servers<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;Blue posters are always right&quot; minute<br />
What we've posted on the forums is the extent of the notes we've made public at this point in time. The complete official notes have not been posted yet. Please take anything posted outside the forums or website with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
This could perfectly be a fake, seriously, if you didn't read this before going through the changes you'll probably make a hundred of puppies sad. <br />
<br />
Can't say you weren't warned now. The full list of change follows<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
Mystical Skyfire Diamond now reduces the next spell cast by 20%, down from 50%. (It also might just be changed to straight stats, still in debate. Don't be surprised if this metagem just gets added stats with the current effect in the initial 2.4 notes, it's still being worked on.)<br />
Shaman Gladiator 4-set bonus now reduces pushback by 30%, down from 70%.</div></div><hr />

Why would they nerf elemental after they buffed it? That makes NO sense. the Treant thing seems super fake, that would make it amazingly op.<br />
<br />
Sorry but i doubt half of these changes are super fake. If they were real, i'd almost quit because shamans were getting the nerf stick again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, this seems rather odd<br />
Nutiring Instinct will still suck, as a druid's AP is calculated based on our form. Basing anything on it outside of cat form is a waste.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, if you're in Cat/Bear form, you'll get lots of extra healing now. I see that as a very big definite plus.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stormgust</div><div class="date">2008-02-06, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the lifebloom nerf won't get past the PTR, unless Blizzard plans to remove Resto Druids in PVE.

However, before I take these in as such, I'd like to see a citation. Some of the changes seem ridiculous, particularly the elemental shaman changes as mentioned.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ippe</div><div class="date">2008-02-06, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, obvious fake. One look at the mage changes is enough to confirm that.</div></div><hr />

Thats proof right there its fake. Turn undead doesn't work in pvp since players are humanoid and this spell only works on Undead and supposedly demons now.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Yep, those are real. Only Blizzard can continue the joke that is Lightwell. It would be really really funny if it was not so sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They do. I hibernate enough hunter pets to know.<br />
The pattern of the notes doesn't work though, just off what was done last patch. Shamans renerfed to the bad point of 2.3. ES has nothing happen to it, its mana efficiency scarcely changes. And the mage nerf just looks like a complaint for 5v5s. And as pointed out above, bears would recieve far too much healing from their Nurturing instinct.<br />
Though the moonkin changes would rock. =P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeffer</div><div class="date">2008-02-06, 10:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fake imo.<br />

Priests and Druids don't need to be nerfed at all in PvP, and I hope that Blizzard ceases to listen to the chain whining eventually. <br />
<br />
The biggest glaring fake about the patch notes is that I really, really doubt Blizzard will be lowering Shadow Priest raid damage by 20, Blizzard has fucked Shadow Priests enough in BC and, they're not exactly heavy hitters in the upper content. List written by a Mage, probably with tears in his/her eyes while doing so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Blizzard stated themselves, &quot;Don't believe any notes they don't submit&quot;.<br />
<br />
These notes had to be made by an angry mage or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Turn Undead now lasts 10 sec. in PvP.&quot; <br />
<br />
Is also a big give away, lock pets don't observe PvP CC related mechanics IIRC. And the change itself is so random and pointless to be warranted regardless. If you want to deal with a warlock's pet, get your own locks to CoS -&gt; Banish it or just kill it with a warr/rouge/hunter/enhanceshammy/retadin.<br />

I find it hard to understand why you post something like this when you initially in your post have a statement which says everything that isn't posted by blizzard on their sites are basicly fake. <br />
<br />
But okay if let ten monkies type on a computer long enough they will eventually write, in this case the real patch notes - or wait, I believe that myth was actually busted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2.4 is to bring everyone up to speed - make the end game really easy, it closing TBC by not only the storyline but all the new 70 will be epic laden quickly and easily. <br />
<br />
Nerfing every class is not this<br />
<br />
Some are just plain ridiculous<br />
<br />
I REALLY hope someone doesn't believe this - Very OTT</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aRtFuL</div><div class="date">2008-02-06, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think this has a rather good chance of being real.<br />
<br />
Why? Because the patch notes didn't yell for nerf or some BS ridculous changes to Mortal Strike, which most other classes whines day in and day out about.<br />
<br />
Also, they buff mages in that list, fully justified imo. Mages are so easily destroyed at the moment in pvp (even by slightly more geared warriors with some experience and smarts on fighting mages).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If fake, best fake ever :)<br />
<br />
However, this seems rather odd<br />
Nutiring Instinct will still suck, as a druid's AP is calculated based on our form. Basing anything on it outside of cat form is a waste.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's because they are nerfing you Mr endless cycloning OP druid. There is no justification whatsoever in a hybrid class having either the ability to cast better than a caster, CC better than a CCer or melee better then a meleer. If this patch note proves to be real it shows that Blizzard finally sees the light.</div></div><hr />

as for turn undead, it wont work on undead players, but it would work on demon pets is what it is saying. If they do like what bloodlust does for warriors, where it drains the hp of the pet instead of it taking damage, it could work.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the changes make sense for arenas, specifically 5v5 because of the insane burst elemental shamans can still do. They're trying to balance it out it seems. Same thing with the icy veins changes. the cookie cutter 5v5 teams can do way too much burst for 3 dps so i think they're trying to change that which is good. I would say around 70% of changes to classes are made with arenas in mind these days. On a side note, lets make earth shield undispellable shall we? :D</div></div><hr />

yeah, seems like they &quot;forgot&quot; to add additional changes, like EotS reworked to 70% passive (stacking with arena bonus), LB n CL back on 3s cast, LO now also grants 15% more spelldmg to LB and CL, or so, if these are not comming up, then its the worst patch notes for eleshammy which i ever seen. tbh these fack notes wants nerf only pvp viable build in only 1 bracket to the hell? lets call it balance :D anyone who made them really get to hate shaman, bcs that &quot;insane&quot; burst isnt such big to high resi targets anyway, any sort of AP/veins build have better burst imho then any eleshammy can achieve</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Shamans are ok, and still need nerfs.<br />
<br />
Stuns, silence, and other CC hurt any other class. <br />
<br />
Now imagine if you leave an uncotroled elemental shaman for 10 sec. He will instagib one of you in no time.<br />
<br />
Shamans don't need CC. You had mana problems and spell pushback problems. Now you got water shield, wich is verry good tool especialy after buff, and pvp set buff.<br />
<br />
If shamans receave a CC, then it's the same like warriors would get &quot;beast Within&quot; spell effect. Copletly devastating and unbalanced.<br />
<br />
game is not balanced 1v1, at least for a resto shaman it is, however for a warrior or any other sucks ass 1v1 class is not. In group you have team8 who should CC persons for you, and assist and save your ass on right time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Agreed. Waaay too many (some overpowered might I add) buffs to the mages.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Actually, scratch that. Not really overpowered as some are pretty much useless.<br />
<br />
Strictly speaking for PvP:<br />
<br />
- We'll never spec far enough into arcane toget improved Blink.<br />
- Prismatic Cloak is still a joke talent<br />
- Putting points in frost ward and ice flows (why isnt it 70% pushback reduction? :( ) means less points for other damage talents.<br />
- No one specs for slow...<br />
<br />
<br />
Still some very good buffs for mages in there. Blink's mana reduction being the main one. We pretty much have to use it every time the cooldown is up and that's 800mana gone instantly. Finally get some sort of push back resist (100% resist with icy veins is awesome).<br />
<br />
Looks like mages might just be back in the game to be taken seriously in arena.</div></div><hr />

The one that makes more sense would the one affecting shadowbolt. The current mechanism favors the stacking of destro locks - something akin to the rolling ignites mechanism. Yes, destro locks do need to see their dmg nurfed in end game, while Blizzard should do something for haste and crit affecting dots, even if in lessened effect. <br />

I would question several of the gross inaccuracies in the notes that pretty much solidify the fact that they're not real, along with the fact that this would pretty much be the end of Shadow Priest raiding.

Nurturing Instinct: Increases your healing spells by up to 50/100% of your Agility, and increases healing done to you by 25/50% of your Attack Power.<br />

<br />
THIS IS THE VERY FAKE. Imp Mend pet give 15%/50% at the very moment. Whoever made this fake patch note used a talent calculator and only saw 15% and a 2 point talent so he assumed it was 30%. FAKE FAKE FAKE<br />
<br />

I know a blue posted this one and i hope it never happen, or at least to something else than Healing Grace. Shaman resto druid is already VERY HEAVY on must have talents and this change would just force PvPers to take a PvE talent.<br />

<br />
If something is ok, it doesn't need nerfs. If something is not ok, then it either needs buffs or nerfs. Given the average shaman population in arena is very low (even lower than mage one, and that's already pathetic), I'd hardly dare say we're overpowered, would you? :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Stuns, silence, and other CC hurt any other class.<br />
<br />
Um... true, but not true. For instance, a mage under attack by a rogue will have his dps severely diminished, since he can't cast. However, he will have tools to run around and control the target (Ice Block, Poly, Blink, Frost Nova, etc.). An Elemental Shaman will have one ability to get out of stunlock and even that one will be a trinket on 2 min cd. You have a point with Silence, however, I'll point to you the fact that only Holy Paladins really suffer from the same problem of one school and permanent casting. Every other class/spec either doesn't cast all the time or has more than one spell school. As for CC in general, that one heavily depends on the type of CC and the class it's targeting. For instance, druids are completely immune to polymorph, while warriors have tools against fear. However, land a sheep on a warrior and he'll be limited by a pvp trinket. In this case, it's a matter of perspective.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now imagine if you leave an uncotroled elemental shaman for 10 sec. He will instagib one of you in no time.<br />
<br />
Things die. That's why I agree that giving us CC or anti-CC would be deadly. Enhancement Shamans deserve anti-CC, though, because they need a tool to get to target reliably (akin to warrior intercept, but something a bit weaker).<br />
<br />
<br />
They cant do this without changing casting time. And it would totaly gimp elemental shaman. FAKE<br />
<br />
Elemental Shamans get a small bonus on CL and LB casts. It received this bonus shortly before the 2.3 launch in order to keep the pre-2.3 dps in light of the patch changes. So bonus reduction/increase is perfectly possible separately from cast timer. <br />
<br />
However, such a change would effectively neutralize everything we've worked for in 2.3, returning us right back to whining boards. What's worse, these patch notes would also mean a drop in LO bonus by around 3%, not to mention the direct effect such a change would have on mana (clearcasting procs on crits), items (Lightning Capacitor is best trinket in game for Ele Shaman BECAUSE of LO), etc. All in all, if this were true, we'd be looking at a HUGE drop in performance raid-wise + the effect the changes would have on pvp burst (byebye heavy burst, hello whining ;))<br />
<br />
All in all, there's a couple of reasonable changes in there (Boomkin regenerating mana with crits for instance), but overall, I can't shake a feeling that this was written by a frustrated raiding mage. I might be wrong, of course and it's just a nightmare come true. We'll know soon enough.</div></div><hr />

The main thing is: WE DON'T KNOW.<br />
So how can you say it's fake?</div></div><hr />

They would probably know their own talents, and not write this. In addition, some of the changes listed there are so stupid that if someone inside blizzard suggested that, they need a good boot in the arse.<br />
Oh, and there are some things on that list that apparently wasn't on the list posted in the benefactors forum on EJ(which is were it originated), which would probably make them fake ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
has blizzard ever done stupid changes in the past to create &quot;balance&quot; in the game? Plus, if they implement this on the TEST server (YOu know that PTR thing were people can test the latest changes on). Does not mean it will ever get implemented on live server.<br />
<br />
Experimenting is goood ;)<br />
<br />
Who know what those devs are up to man, they do the craziest things these days. And second, it's their game, they can change talents, they can change/add new ones.</div></div><hr />

Come on, that's like trying out block value blocking 3-4 times as much damage as it does now, at least?<br />
And actually writing flat out wrong things in the notes is a bit odd.<br />
Improved Mend Pet now has a 50/100% chance to remove one Curse, Disease, Magic or Poison effect, up from 15/30%.It's 15% rank1 and 50% rank 2 on live servers now. Smells a lot like someone just looked at a talent calculator and didn't even check what rank 2 was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
treants *are* a 41 point talent after all.... and balance druids do suck in pvp (only use for this change). Hell, most serious PVP moonkins go 40/0/21 and get NS over treants anyway. (That or even more in resto.)<br />
<br />
Besides that, the pets hitting the target (no pet bar, remember?) would just break the roots 2 seconds after it lands, basically just wasting DRs.<br />
<br />
In short, it's not THAT powerful.<br />
<br />
the moonkin form changes however, would be amazing, and I would love blizzard long time if true.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlock pets. That said, I'm unsure if pet targeted spells, such as Hibernate, have reduced effect in PvP. <br />
<br />
<br />
They do.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nevbo</div><div class="date">2008-02-07, 11:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the changes to incenerate and nerf to Imp shadow bolt are there to influence more warlocks to become fire destro locks instead of shadow destro.<br />
The lifetap change was probably because too many people complain about warlocks never being oom *except locks*.<br />
<br />
The shaman changes would not be as bad if they rebuffed LO proc to do full dmg instead of half but could not crit. Tho they would have to reduce the proc rate from 20% to like 10-15%.<br />
<br />
The mage changes are not that great at all for all you people going omglawl uber mage changes oped. Icey veins no longer stacks with bloodlust REALLY sucks, no more making use of molten fury + bloodlust + veins for a huge dps spike on mobs.<br />
The arcane talents that were changed NEEDED it, Slow has always been too expensive and blink has also been a expensive spell to cast.<br />
And OMG IMBA mages get their armor increased by 100% of their int instead of 50% now, Oh what will you do with those mages that have an extra 400-500 armor?<br />
The improvement to the reflection talents has been needed for awhile, the spells used to reflect a certain % of the dmg after talents, then they changed it to a low reflect chance, now its a decent reflect chance and a viable pvp talent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Priest changes are a given, mana burn has always been a powerful tool, a disc priest making other casters gib within 15 seconds draining their whole mana pool. Tho if they put this in they need to reduce the mana cost of hunters viper sting, and warlocks drain mana by 50% too.<br />
The change to lightwell would not be so bad if they accually made it moble and follow the damn priest, then also make it so the dmg being healed will not be removed if u take damage. Would make this a GREAT pve talent then.<br />
<br />
The paladin changes are probably purely for anti-warlock aspect of pvp, Lawl stupid felhunter spell lock is for kids, *turn undead*.<br />
<br />
Druid changes are iffy.<br />
They did not say which co-efficents of life bloom are being reduced, if its the HoT or the final bloom, or the whole thing.<br />
Cyclone is a very effective pvp tool and useful for pve, reduction to 20 yards kinda sux alot tho. Will make it a very situational spell.<br />
<br />
The change to tree of life.... more of a Meh, Druid is strong for healing with his hots, and in raid situations healing touch is almost never needed unless u know people are not gunna take burst dmg between that big heal. 3 second cast is a long time even if the heal is REALLY big.<br />
Change to Tranquility talent would be nice if it accually reduced to cooldown to the damn spell too, 10 minutes for a group HoT Channeled spell really sucks.<br />
<br />
I already made my reply about nurturing instinct, IMO its how bears will beable to be healed through crushing burst dps and spell burst. Sense druids lack a form of parry/block for crushing chance reduction and any form of spell dmg reduction it will just help healers heal them. So instead of healers healing druids like htey have 2500 healing it will be like 3500 healing, basicly like healing a lock with fel armor on. This also means that non healing equiped hybrids can help heal a druid tank too because it will be like they have a boost to healing.<br />
<br />
Moonkin changes are nice, meleeing for mana was never a good idea in a caster form. tho I can see how this 2% increased in total mana on spell crit can get abit IMBA, spam rank 1 wrath at .5 second cast and almost no mana cost to fill up your mana bar.<br />
<br />
The force of nature change would be nice if that root did not suffer diminishing returns on its self, make it a &quot;unique&quot; root that lasts for 4 seconds each application, so it will just keep refreshing every time the treants get a proc.</div></div><hr />

I went through the &quot;notes&quot; (what i see as an internal memo, a brainstorm), and read the responses. Then I decided to look over each change and make my own comments to them, to try and bring a little constructive feedback into this thread.<br />
<br />
About me: I play a decent rogue in a decent european battlegroup, for pvp pleasure. I also play a maintank on another realm, for pve pleasure.<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
* Cyclone range reduced to 20 yards, down from 30. Reasonable change from a 2s/3s perspective, likely to be true<br />
* Lifebloom healing coefficient reduced by $ Seems over the top, depends on how much, unlikely to be true<br />
* Natural Perfection now reduces damage by 2/3/4% down from 1/3/5% Minor adjustment, likely to be true<br />
* Tree of Life: You may now cast any Restoration spell in this form. Sounds logical, likely to be true<br />
* Improved Tranquility: Now also reduces the mana cost of Tranquility by 10/20%. Minor adjustment, likely to be true<br />
* Moonkin Form no longer gains 150% attack power or mana returned from melee hits, but now refunds 2% of your total mana every time you critically hit with a spell. 2% sounds high, but fits the scaling of moonkins overall with crit, likely to be true with other percentages<br />
* Force of Nature: Treants now have a 15% chance to proc Entangling Roots on the target. PvP buff change, helping kiting from moonkin, seems likely possibly with % tweaking<br />
* Nurturing Instinct: Increases your healing spells by up to 50/100% of your Agility, and increases healing done to you by 25/50% of your Attack Power. Feral druids need help in PvP context, likely to be true with different %<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunter<br />
<br />
* Improved Mend Pet now has a 50/100% chance to remove one Curse, Disease, Magic or Poison effect, up from 15/30%. So what if its an internal draft and it was 15%/50%, blizzard employees are people too. I write that off as a typo<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
<br />
* Blink mana cost reduced roughly 40% Likely to be true, the mana cost of blink is excessive<br />
* Improved Blink now increases the distance you Blink by 15/30%, and you have a 15/30% chance to reduce the cast time of your next Fireball, Frostbolt, or Arcane Blast spell by 50% after you Blink. (Might just do one of these effects…) Possibly an attempt to bring another spec than 17/0/44 into the PvP sphere of a mage, not unlikely<br />
* Prismatic Cloak now reduces damage taken by 3/6%, up from 2/4% <br />
* Mana Cost of Slow reduced roughly 40% Possibly an attempt to bring another spec than 17/0/44 into the PvP sphere of a mage, not unlikely<br />
* Arcane Fortitude now increases your armor by an amount equal to 100% of your Intellect, up from 50%. <br />
* Mana Shield now scales with spell damage. (Max rank with full S3/best gear will absorb around 1Kish, added damage absorb doesn't cost/consume mana to the shield, it will always cost what the tooltip says) Same, trying to add more specs to a mage's PvP sphere<br />
* Improved Fire Ward is now Molten Shield New placement of new spell, increased survivability for fire mages<br />
* New Talent: Molten Shield – Reduces all damage taken by 2/4% while using Molten Armor, and causes your Fire Ward to have a 25/50% chance to reflect Fire spells while active. New placement of new spell, increased survivability for fire mages. If you try to follow the concept here, adding more specs to the mage arsenal in PvP seems likely<br />
* Frost Warding: Chance to reflect Frost spells while Frost ward is active by 25/50%, up from 10/20%. Burst defense for RMP mirrors? No comment on likelyness to be true<br />
* Icy Veins no longer increases the chance your chilling effects Freeze the target, but now reduces pushback by 100% for 20 sec. Possibly overpowered change, not likely to go through<br />
* Icy Veins spell haste bonus no longer stacks with Bloodlust. Very likely to see an overall bloodlust nerf<br />
* Ice Flows now gives you a 15/30% chance to avoid interruption caused by damage while casting any Frost spell.Mages need pushback protection. Likely to be true.<br />
<br />
<br />
Priest<br />
<br />
* Mana Burn effect reduced roughly 50%. <br />
* Mana Burn cast time reduced by 1 second.<br />
* Improved Mana Burn: Now increases the amount of mana burned from your Mana Burn spell by 10/20%.<br />
Looks like they're attempting to adjust manaburn so its always 2 second cast but slightly less effective. Makes sense to overall slightly nerf Mana Burn since especially while combined with haste effects is pretty ridiculous. Likely to see manaburn adjustment, this seems likely to be on test<br />
<br />
* Focused Will now reduces damage by 2/3/4% down from 1/3/5% Surivability adjustment, likely to be true<br />
* Lightwell: Charges increased to 15, up from 5. Lightwell sucks ass, this wouldn't help a bit, but hey, its an internal memo<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
* Turn Undead no longer fears the target, and now incapacitates it. <br />
* Turn Undead now works on demons. (Prob will be renamed to a diff spell) <br />
* Turn Undead is now subject to diminishing returns. <br />
* Turn Undead now lasts 10 sec. in PvP.<br />
I see this as partly a warlock counter and possibly getting ready to see Death Knight summoned creatures that possibly will be vital to them in PvP without them being permacontrolled by a paladin<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
* Envenom no longer consumes the Poison applications. A little weak change, but a slight PvE buff. Envenom needs help though, so this seems likely<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
* Lightning Bolt: Spell coefficient reduced by $ Excessive change, don't think we will see that on test<br />
* Lightning Overload can no longer proc on instant cast spells. (aka NS+CL won't proc it) Burst adjustment, seems likely that they want to test it<br />
* Lightning Overload can no longer critically hit.Burst adjustment, seems likely that they want to test it<br />
* Tremor Totem and Poison Cleansing Totem now pulse every 3 seconds, down from 5. Necessary help since the totems are destroyed fast in PvP anyway<br />
* Earth Shield mana cost reduced by 50%This in combination with dispell protection and the charge change makes Earth Shield more spammable, in the event it is dispelled which happens alot<br />
* Earth Shield now has 6 charges, down from 10. <br />
* Healing Grace: Now also reduces the chance your spells will be dispelled by 10/20/30% Believe this was a confirmed change<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlock<br />
<br />
* Life Tap: Spell coefficient reduced by $ <br />
* Life Tap now consumes toughly 10% more health when used.<br />
* Demonic Knowledge now increases your spell damage by an amount equal to 4/7/10% down from 5/10/15%<br />
* Improved Shadowbolt: Now only works for the Warlock. Not likely that this will go through<br />
* Improved Shadowbolt: Now increases Shadow damage by 3/6/9/12/15%, down from 4/8/10/14/20% Not likely that this will go through<br />
* Incinerate spell coefficient increased by $ Even if noone uses Incinerate doesn't mean that noone ever will. Look at Shadowstep for example. Shadowstep was a laugh for a year until the repeated buffs and now everyone are speccing it<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
<br />
* Endless Rage now properly generates 25% more rage from damage dealt (previously only 12% cause of a bug) Believe this was an official statement<br />
* Improved Hamstring: Now has a 10 second cooldown. Makes sense, to reduce chain imp. hamstring+macestun procs<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
* Mystical Skyfire Diamond now reduces the next spell cast by 20%, down from 50%. (It also might just be changed to straight stats, still in debate. Don't be surprised if this metagem just gets added stats with the current effect in the initial 2.4 notes, it's still being worked on.) Possible. Wouldn't count on it<br />
* Shaman Gladiator 4-set bonus now reduces pushback by 30%, down from 70%. Unlikely change <br />
<br />
Overall, these changes don't look over the top for me, in general. Given that it's an internal memo, we have previously numerous times seen stuff on PTR's that didn't go through on Live. Some things are excessive, like the Lightning Bolt coefficiency and the metagem change. Some things look silly, like the Lightwell change.<br />
<br />
But overall, i think there's sense to the bulk of this.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrostemplar</div><div class="date">2008-02-07, 12:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, for those claiming &quot;mage wish list&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
Blink mana cost reduced roughly 40%<br />
<br />
<br />
It is a changed claimed for a long time (making it less likely to be implemented? ;)). Fact is that blink mana cost scales too well. 600 mana + for blinking is one of the things that hurts mages mana reserve. In raiding is still an issue, but not as much.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Blink now increases the distance you Blink by 15/30%, and you have a 15/30% chance to reduce the cast time of your next Fireball, Frostbolt, or Arcane Blast spell by 50% after you Blink. (Might just do one of these effects…)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mmmh - nobody (I know off) has the improved blink talent, but this change (buff) seems a bit odd - increasing the distance has been going around some forum ideas for some times, particularly due to the increased mobility of some melee classes (rogues..) and the need to reach the hunters faster. The chance to lower the cast time after blinking is weird but actually makes some sense. One thing though - it is quite new - at least I had never seen it written on a forum. Usually the request is to blink to drop target (à lá feign death).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Prismatic Cloak now reduces damage taken by 3/6%, up from 2/4%<br />
<br />
<br />
Mostly Irrelevant as PVP mages do not usually have PC.. I think ^^ . I don't know any mage that claimed fo this change.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Cost of Slow reduced roughly 40%<br />
<br />
<br />
Quite similar to the blink &quot;thing&quot; but it is something not really pressed forward for many - very very very few mages have slow - one of the reasons being the very high mana cost compared to a bit less powerful R1 frostbolt. And that it demands 40 points in an underperforming tree to get it. Cutting its cost makes sense but I don't think it is on the &quot;wish list&quot; of anyone but the rare deep arcane mages (I think I've met a couple at most in the past month and an half.. if that many).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcane Fortitude now increases your armor by an amount equal to 100% of your Intellect, up from 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Irrelevant... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Shield now scales with spell damage. (Max rank with full S3/best gear will absorb around 1Kish, added damage absorb doesn't cost/consume mana to the shield, it will always cost what the tooltip says)<br />
<br />
<br />
This one is strangely worded - the idea is that MS scales with SP dmg but the mana consumed is capped at its default absorption value? <br />
This skill should have been adjusted to the TBC Stamina values from launch to a) 1/1 ratio and b) increased absorption value by 50%+. <br />
This possible change is an improvement that actually goes more in line with the changes in all shields (to scale with spell dmg), but still lacks a lot in the claimed improvement of efficiency.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Improved Fire Ward is now Molten Shield<br />
New Talent: Molten Shield – Reduces all damage taken by 2/4% while using Molten Armor, and causes your Fire Ward to have a 25/50% chance to reflect Fire spells while active.<br />
Frost Warding: Chance to reflect Frost spells while Frost ward is active by 25/50%, up from 10/20%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Makes some sense - although I think not many (anyone?) talents fire ward - so no, this is not any mages &quot;wet dream&quot;. The reduces all damage takes seems a bit off, as MA already reduces the crit chance, but it may be a way to promote the talent... which I doubt it will be taken anyway, unless further viability is introduced in fire PVP.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Icy Veins no longer increases the chance your chilling effects Freeze the target, but now reduces pushback by 100% for 20 sec.<br />
Icy Veins spell haste bonus no longer stacks with Bloodlust.<br />
Ice Flows now gives you a 15/30% chance to avoid interruption caused by damage while casting any Frost spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the big one. Pushback protection in PVP for frost. At a cost though. Anyway, as one PVP mage said the other - &quot;IV made me realize how few spell I actually cast... all instants really&quot;. The recent &quot;trend&quot; was to put back casting into PVP and to end with spell pushback. <br />
<br />
What I did not see:<br />
-Mana gems on its own separate CD<br />
-Increased damage on the empowered fireball talents<br />
-Improvement of &quot;playing with fire&quot; (at least 2/4/6% increased dmg)<br />
-Changes in combustion<br />
<br />
So no, this is not a &quot;mage wishlist&quot;. Some changes would be good (blink mana cost, mana shield and probably IV) the other mostly irrelevant as are improvements for seldom used talents.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you that (if these notes are true) Blizzard looks like they are trying to open up other specs to be viable in arena, but I think they're wasting their time. Who in their right mind would give up on the water elemental for improved blink or the new cost efficient slow? I sure wouldn't.<br />
<br />
They'd be better off buffing frost tree and the utilities that mages use (blink, counterspell etc) rather than trying to make the arcane tree viable or the fire tree viable in arena. It's just not gonna work out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ozzhis</div><div class="date">2008-02-07, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello,<br />
<br />
Before I say anything else, I agree that the patch notes might be fake. I play a mage myself, and I wouldn't see those changes coming for my mage either so soon or in such quantity. This was probably written by a mage (as someone said here) as a wishlist (and a mage that couldn't spell the talent called 'ICE FLOES' and not 'ICE FLOWS'. &quot;hip hop indahouse yo&quot;); still, it has a couple of good ideas, mainly the one concerning Icy Veins and the introduction of some passive pushback resist for Frost (which, at some point, will be implemented if Blizzard can't buff deep fire to have acceptable performances in arenas).<br />
<br />
Another thing pointing to a fake is that (as some also said before me here) the changes in all the classes are very different in number (poor Rogues only got something regarding Envenom) and also in quality (mage changes might be the best ones among these notes).<br />
<br />
Now, I do think that it's useful to have these notes, even if fake, in mmo-champion. They're tied to the game we play and, even if they do not go live, they at least incite discussion and as we know, ladies and gentlemen, it's always through discussion that we reach 'the' point. Also, they are marked as &quot;possibly fake&quot;, which is much better than turning on the hype machine and saying &quot;omg they are teh reealz stuffz&quot;.<br />
<br />
Though yeah, having a source, like you do for Blizzard information, would be a plus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
maybe part of the reason blizzard hasn't responded to the &quot;QQ, my pet needs more stam and more armor and a % of my resilience&quot; is because they want people to try other trees. while highly situational, dragon's breath could be great for pallys or rogues, and arcane puts out some decent overall damage. i'm not saying that they are viable specs right now, but you may see some people switch over at some point with the new changes. as a warrior i despise slow, and while i only see it in bg's and not arenas, running a war/lock/druid or even war/druid/sham combo a slow mage would rofl me. <br />
<br />
rogues said the same thing of the HARP spec nerf and lolstep still sucks, and now most of the rogues i see in arena are shadowstep, and it works great for people who know how to use it. a mage with 3k armor (thats a swag, dunno an actual number) and taking 6% less damage with a 13 second improved range blink and a 1k shield from mana shield that is talented to cost less mana rivals the double iceblock. i also don't see water elemental as any special reason to go frost, at best they get off 1 freeze before being blown up, and even then we have caught them early with intercept or HoJ or deathcoil to avoid the shatter combo.</div></div><hr />

poor rogues?! did you read warrior changes :D our already underpowered 41 pt talent is getting fixed to be slight less underpowered. while i argue that they could be real and not are totally unreasonable, i hope someone forgot all the other warrior changes in that memo, would be sad if blizz failed to fix certain things, let alone actually make some real changes.<br />

that would be a sad day. ele shamans were having fun, and i don't consider them op. to me the only real op things are the synergies created for classes like disc priest / ele shaman / ua lock or frost mage where you are insta-burned or insta-killed. granted synergy is what makes them strong, but players are smart and i think at times they create combos and situations which blizzard did not intend, a sad side effect of adding so many new skills/abilities to the game.</div></div><hr />

No I didn't miss - thing is put it in context - I was replying to the &quot;mage wishlist&quot; idea. The wishlists usually revolve around buffing the currently best performance trees/talents, not creating alternative ones that may be chosen but not really more powerful. So from a &quot;whishlist&quot; perspective, this would not deliver ;)<br />
<br />
If these changes are true, yep it is an attempt to create alternatives to the &quot;go frost or get lost&quot; arena team spec. Not that the class gets significantly more powerful, but certainly more varied. <br />
<br />
One the other hand arcane needs some help - it has been thrown out of end game raiding by fire and in PVP frost still is way better than anything else...</div></div><hr />

<br />
that is true what i was saying they are going for. same they are trying to do with envenom and shadowstep and endless rage and all non-cookie builds. attempting to at least give classes different options for specs. and true arcane is more of a support tree to buff your fire/frost dps with clearcasting and crit and +spell damage. arcane missiles and arcane bolt are not superb on their own, but to me are not THAT far off being viable again. i imagine blizz is happy enough mages have some variation with pve specs.</div></div><hr />

Instead of 100% gear dependency for spell scaling they should remodel that to something like <br />
55% on primary stat Spirit (1 Spirit = Spell Power x 2 and Intellect = 0.5 Spell Power or something like that) the other 45% of bonus is set with current gear only stat (+x to spell healing and +y to spell damage). <br />

Regarding arenas - no that I pay much attention to those, but some do - only shamans have worse representation.<br />

<br />
Now, if a lock has problems against a mage... even a frost one... :). Against a non frost, the felpuppy vs a mage is a balanced fight :P. <br />
<br />
<br />
Leveling as a mage is average - if you leveled one and more than one class you'd know that - there are faster (hunters, rogues, locks, druids) and there are slower (priests, warriors*...). But that is not really much of a concern. Like BGs - mages are good at BGs? really? /care (personally I think that warriors rule at PVP as long as they have a healer - making their BG performance variable - but the really good BG performers were always hunters and Locks).<br />
<br />
<br />
Raiding - forget it - mages have been subpar since TBC was out. Really subpar. <br />
<br />
Where mages are really strong is in 5 man - water, portals and sheeps are always nice to have available. <br />
<br />
*without a pocket healer :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think a pet with 3k hp, 0 resilience and runs out of mana before his 45sec duration is OP, then you really are an idiot. I'm sorry, but that's all I can say to you.<br />
<br />
RMP is powerful, but you know what? Mages rely on the rogue and priest more than they rely on the mage. The HARP nerf to rogues hurt mages just as much as it did rogues. Now the mage/rogue combo is no where near as strong as it used to be.<br />
<br />
In the 5's all mages do is just sheep a target, remove curses and try to get in a shatter combo. Hell the 2346 setup (warlock replaces mage) is better than a mage in the 5's.<br />
<br />
So mages are now really gimp in the 2's (they always have been but the HARP nerf hurt hard), good in the 3's (as long as you have competent rogue/priest with you) and replaceable with a more stronger class in the 5's.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if you're a warlock losing to a mage, you are a terrible, terrible warlock.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: You lose to one class, and you say that the warlock nerfs are getting unbalanced? GTFO.</div></div><hr />

Mages r powerful in arena? You kinding me rite?<br />

Do you know how long can a low resilience mage survive against full pvp gear atm? best is about 15 secs. That's how long it takes me to take down an epic mage that has low res. They are gone in 3 or 4 hits - and that's given even a frost mage. If I was lucky and proc sword spec they can be gone in under 8 secs.<br />
<br />
No other classes has as little pvp survivability even without resilience.</div></div><hr />

mend is an arena buff, and a huge one at that for dotters or other classes that drop CC/debuffs on the pet. granted its a bm buff largely but you may see some mm hunters go for it. any hunter that plays a drain setup knows how important it is to keep the scorpion up.</div></div><hr />

BM is great for arena if your 3v3 and 5v5 need a burst in dmg , ive play lots of games as BM and .. all i can say is that im more useful as MM/surv . but dude .. this &quot; hunter buff &quot; is like if health funnel was removing dots and shits by each tick...i mean ..

100% of all those each tick is imba. warlocks will never kill your pet lol. also being a warrior pets are easy to kill when not healed, but ultimately if a healer starts early we wont waste the time downing one.<br />

trust me i'm waiting for more warrior changes other than some minor talent/ability fixes, its not just hunters :D</div></div><hr />

But I think these pages would successfully manage to destroy the destruction warlock. Why would you raid with a destruction warlock after these nerfs if they no longer bennefit your shadow priests and they get a 5% damage nerf on improved shadow bolts which for a destruction spec is HUGE.<br />
<br />
Affliction warlocks remain rather unchanged so it would promote raiding as affliction over destruction in my opinion.<br />
<br />
One of our greatest counter classes can no imobilize our pets. Great. So, that means we are no longer viable as a means of taking down healers. If this is the case I can't see anyone actually wanting to take a warlock to arenas or even to plows. This would be a huge nerf in my opinion. <br />
<br />
I agree that it reads as a mage wish list. Every single thing listed for the mage is a buff and every single thing listed for the warlock is a nerf. If that isn't what magists want then I don't know what is.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2008-02-21, 03:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I think this has a rather good chance of being real.<br />
<br />
Why? Because the patch notes didn't yell for nerf or some BS ridculous changes to Mortal Strike, which most other classes whines day in and day out about.<br />
<br />
Also, they buff mages in that list, fully justified imo. Mages are so easily destroyed at the moment in pvp (even by slightly more geared warriors with some experience and smarts on fighting mages).<br />
<br />
That's because they are nerfing you Mr endless cycloning OP druid. There is no justification whatsoever in a hybrid class having either the ability to cast better than a caster, CC better than a CCer or melee better then a meleer. If this patch note proves to be real it shows that Blizzard finally sees the light.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me guess...you play a level 70 mage. I guess it means nothing to you that these notes would basically destroy every class in the game that is not a mage right? I mean, hell, if these ever go live I will have absolutely no desire to ever play my warlock in raids again. I only play my warlock in raids. I only play my warlock. In short, if these were real I'd be going back to duel boxing Dark Age of Camelot because it would be proof Blizzard cares nothing at all about 95% of its players (those that don't play mages).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2008-02-21, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, the changes make sense for arenas, specifically 5v5 because of the insane burst elemental shamans can still do. They're trying to balance it out it seems. Same thing with the icy veins changes. the cookie cutter 5v5 teams can do way too much burst for 3 dps so i think they're trying to change that which is good. I would say around 70% of changes to classes are made with arenas in mind these days. On a side note, lets make earth shield undispellable shall we? :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard has claimed they do not balance for arenas. If it is truely the case that they balance only for arenas (or even 70% for arenas) now and they ignore PvE content balance as a whole then I really don't see this game keeping players. Arenas is such a SMALL part of this game that the PvE nerfs will effect players much more to the point of quiting.</div></div><hr />

Although my main is a mage, not only I play other chars as I have friends that have other chars as mains. WoW has recently seen (proposed of effective) a series of nerfs to locks. Although it might seem unfair (or harsh or whatever) fact is that these changes are way too late really.<br />
<br />
Locks have had a great ride in TBC. It is not bound to last. They are great at PVP (maybe not the best after the recent changes but still solid), great at raiding, the lowest upkeep costs, reasonably good utility. It is not bound to last.<br />
<br />
Previously locks were bellow average in raiding, not because of the class per se, but due to two issues: debuff limits and threat. It was a great PVP class, and based on stamina. In TBC, with great spell sclalling, great buffs (e.g. the armor...), the halving of item cost of one of their base stats, the great synergies (with SPs) and with the issues resolved their were bound to shine.. to much really.<br />
<br />
It makes no sense that locks have better damage, better survivability, better sustainability and more utility than mages (of any spec). Ofc that it didn't help mages the completely unexplainable nerf to their primary nukes (aka &quot;damage tax&quot;).<br />
<br />
After one year, Locks (and SPs) seem to be getting &quot;normalized&quot; (while hunters.. but that is another subject). Yes, that means getting damage nerf, as currently, with similar gear levels their damage is IMO above what it should compared to other classes.</div></div><hr />

A. You only play mage, you don't know about anything concerning balance. Your opinion means nil.<br />
<br />
D. Go check out WoW Raid Simulator. Mage is every bit equally capable of hanging with Lock in DPS, problem is 90% (including you apparently) are too dumb as fuck to know what they're doing. Your gimpness does not afford you a handicap, or it might, look what it did for Huntards.<br />
<br />
E. Lock beats you in PVP. So? Warlock should be the only job with counter-classes? Be glad you don't have three, like we do.<br />
<br />
F. Don't talk about shit like 'synergies' if you don't know what you're talking about. You likely don't even have a clue how multipliers work and how much an SP means to fire or arcane mage.<br />
<br />
G. Locks were hot shit pre-tbc, but you'd likely not know that because you weren't there. And PVP? Hell if you think we're good in PVP now, you should have seen when it took 3+ of some jobs to kill us.<br />
<br />
H. Mage's never were and likely never will be as good, in general, across all tiers because - again, in general - they're just uneducated. That could be the only explanation as to why simulationcraft puts Mage at within single to low double digit DPS of Warlock in the same gear stats, but so many fail so hard in reaching their potential.</div></div><hr />

lawl @ mage complaining about a nerf.<br />
<br />
10% tax, yeah that's rough. Try 200% dot tax. Try 2 second casted spells getting instant cast coefficients both talented and untalented. Yeah, that 10% tax (where albeit you get higher dps) compares at all with what Locks got done to them in 1.9.<br />
<br />
I say apply a 1.9 style nerf to mage ass.</div></div><hr />

A more complete answer: you are an ignorant 1st poster troll wannabe with no manners that instead of debating the issue at cause resorted to ad hominem, which is particularly funny taking into consideration that you know absolutely nothing regarding the person/char you are opposing. (this is the abstract for fast readers)<br />
<br />
So for more info - not that I owe you any - I've been playing WoW for over 2 years (ehh pre TBC), did end game pre-tbc but never went past Loot Reaver in TBC - and no it was not due to be unable to find a end game guild - I got bored out of the game and didn't play for 8 months or so (early June 2007). For Blizzard happiness I've returned since the begining of the year. <br />
<br />
More irrelevant info: My favorite fight ever is Nefarion (hi Nefy /hug) and it took me over 40 drakki kills to get my DS0 chest (to be replaced by the banana one 2 weeks later, but alas). I could fill the board with more details, but what I normally write is boring enough. <br />
<br />
Now to the points: <br />
A) too stupid to deserve any comments; (B-C were deleted due to excessive stupidity I guess)<br />
<br />
D) is uninformed, particularly if you are arguing that a certain class is composed of more &quot;expert players&quot; than other, which is quite funny (which reminds me of what a smart hunter with a sense of humor said &quot;Before the patch I was struggling. Now I'm skilled&quot;). End game damage is a function of class abilities, group composition and encounter design. When you analyze a sufficiently large amount of encounters player skill and group composition stop being a important factor. There isn't any significant skill in pressing the same button during an encounter (ok, mages have it way harder (lol) as they have to press 2) - destro locks and fire mages playstyles are just that similar :P<br />
<br />
E) I never mentioned mage vs lock pvp, much less my own PVP - as a PVE specced firemage I get beat by everything but prot specced players and healers (not that I kill them). The anti-class (or counter class) concept is a bit broken at core, and it seems to be more of a psychological forum created excuse to make up for the &quot;game not balanced on 1on1&quot; than anything that Blizzard has said. And no, mages don't have 3 &quot;anti classes&quot;... lol.<br />
<br />
F) The ignorant one is you - SPs/mages is not synergy but, from a biological point of view, parasitism (actually not quite but I can't really recall the non symbiotic relationship :P) - but feel free to tell me what advantage a SP has in having a mage in his party (besides the mage not going OOM). To see synergy, go to Destro lock ISB/SP... nab. <br />
<br />
G) So tell me how many locks did minimaxing guilds took into end game? How many were in the first KT kill by Nihilum? Now tell me that they were &quot;Hot Shit&quot; and that Nihilum are nothing but a bunch of noobz and you are the expert... lol. The PVP part, your reading comprehension is lacking (like your manners...), so I'll make it easy and self quote with a boldie:<br />
<br />
<br />
They are great at PVP (maybe not the best after the recent changes but still solid)<br />
<br />
Anyway it a fun way of admitting that locks were OP and needed a nerf.<br />
<br />
H. See D) really. Anyway your &quot;simulationcraft&quot; may be full of fail, really. <br />
----<br />
<br />
Now for something more valuable: Blizzard buffs and nerfs classes according to their own (quite mysterious and that seems to defy logic) internal design. Even if all the announced (and they were &quot;ideas to be tested&quot; not final), locks will remain a strong class in all sectors, still wanted in raids, just not as dominant. Raidingwise the class still will be in a better situation than in pre-TBC.</div></div><hr />

lawl. You've never even heard of it, it's way past your comprehension level. Before this thread you likely didn't even know the damn thing existed. Go go http://www.shadowpriest.com you have a few months of reading and crunching before you can even talk to some of those guys in a language they'd understand. Possibly years. Might not ever happen in your case.<br />

I'm just glad you made it clear you've played for 2 years and don't know a damn thing, though. Keep up the good work! Fully backing my statement that some classes attract dumb players.<br />
