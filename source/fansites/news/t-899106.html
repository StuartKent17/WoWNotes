<br />
A few things worth mentioning:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other classes aren't in the game files yet<br />
The helm of the warrior set is bugged on female models. <br />
Multiple recolors have ALWAYS been here, and doesn't mean that Blizzard is going to use one color for each spec or anything like that. It's been like this for years. The official previews don't have multiple colors so just assume there's only one. <br />

And this maybe the weakest since, if not even weaker than ToC as far as this Tier art goes. <br />
<br />
IMHO... It's bland and instantly forgettable, no inspiration, and no care it seems. I wonder if blizzard cut the art budget on this, or if it just that their best artists are that much better than the people they left WoW in's hands?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, how about the faces are so out of place on that set that it distracts from overall feel of the armor?<br />
<br />
While the cracked stone with a lava undercurrent look is nice, they did little to accentuate it and seems like an afterthought on what could have just been bland grey steel plating.<br />
<br />
When Blizzard said they were making a plate class tier resemble stone giants, I was expecting something along the lines of Lord Anthrycist (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/firelands_raid_04.jpg), not the same Fire Giants we saw years ago in Molten Core. The fact that a giant's face on our armor is so laughably tiny also lessens the feel of the armor. If they insisted on staying with the face of the giant on our armor, they could have easily stretched it out so that half the face is our left shoulderpad (easily done if symmetrical without needing to craft to a left/right with differences to make each unique) and half is the right, or that the face itself was the entire shoulderpad. <br />
<br />
This armor just feels lackluster, as if there's no real thought put into it, or that it was pulled from the back pages of someone's sketchbook after they rushed something together in a matter of minutes.</div></div><hr />

Overall looks like a fucking molten golem, cannot be cooler!<br />
<br />
Helm looks intense I love it!<br />
Belt looks intimidating and very overpowering.<br />
Shoulders are molten rocks, delicious! <br />
Rest of the set goes together very well, personally I like the black and orange one.<br />
<br />
Something somewhat new and creative, and IN MY OPINION the best looking tier since onslaught.<br />
<br />
Also, best T12 set, by a mile, sorry clothies :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baracuda</div><div class="date">2011-05-05, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sure, how about the faces are so out of place on that set that it distracts from overall feel of the armor?<br />
<br />
While the cracked stone with a lava undercurrent look is nice, they did little to accentuate it and seems like an afterthought on what could have just been bland grey steel plating.<br />
<br />
When Blizzard said they were making a plate class tier resemble stone giants, I was expecting something along the lines of Lord Anthrycist (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/april/firelands_raid_04.jpg), not the same Fire Giants we saw years ago in Molten Core. The fact that a giant's face on our armor is so laughably tiny also lessens the feel of the armor. If they insisted on staying with the face of the giant on our armor, they could have easily stretched it out so that half the face is our left shoulderpad (easily done if symmetrical without needing to craft to a left/right with differences to make each unique) and half is the right, or that the face itself was the entire shoulderpad. <br />
<br />
This armor just feels lackluster, as if there's no real thought put into it, or that it was pulled from the back pages of someone's sketchbook after they rushed something together in a matter of minutes.<br />
<br />
I guess I can agree with making the faces larger or just the entire shoulder, post on official forum if you actually want a chance to for ideas to go through ^^</div></div><hr />

Isn't that what Warriors use to DPS? their face? Just kidding! love you warrior types really :P<br />

The faceplate lacks detail as to guide attention to the shoulders, similar to tier 6. A molten rock mass held together by rivets and runed elementium framework. The molten giant theme suits the warrior better than Anthrycist would have, though some improvements can be made to the belt and lighting effects to add to the concept of being bound within a mobile furnace.</div></div><hr />

PFF what? T3 is a billion times better than T2, T2 lookes like something Wall-e put together. T6 was one of the best looking if you take into account all 8 pieces and pair it with Bulwark of Azzinoth. Best RP set ever.</div></div><hr />

This ^<br />
I still think all plate armours should look like plate. The DK looks like something a clown form a Tim Burton movie would wear and the paladin has a dress. I mean really? The paladin's set looks more like a warlocks. Tailors should be able to do new paladin armour pieces instead of blacksmiths now.</div></div><hr />

I admit it, i lol'd. If you look at the bottom set, her belly and back are covered. Which is good, because i like that color setup the best.<br />
<br />
I actually like the Golemag (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=11988#screenshots:id=159363) shoulders. The first warrior set i've been impressed with in a very long time. I'm also more fond of the orange/yellow, and then red, as far as colors are concerned. Though blue is always a nice color, it defies the essence of Magma, Lava, Fire, and RAGE!!!!<br />

The helm looks like it has a single dimension cut down the middle, its way to linear. It looks like some weird samurai ninja armor. The belt and gloves, with that elemental crack in the middle; looks horrible. This looks like a step down in the number of geometric sides aloud on the gear.

You know who's face that is? It was the guy who said warrior t11 looked dumb.<br />

We warriors like to put the face of people who don't like our gear on our gear so they can not like our gear while they're on our gear. &lt;---did i do it right? I don't think so... If you complain you'll be next.<br />

not to mention that more often than not people also tend to close the eye not looking through the scope then firing a scoped rifle(or any sort of firearm for that matter) so its perfectly reasonable for hunters to have a eye patch.</div></div><hr />

Living things?<br />
I have not seen an animation of this gear set as of yet... To me 'living things' would be like the t6 warlock wings, or the t10? shammy shovel tusks.<br />
Warrior gear, and tank gear in general have had plenty of faces on their gear.<br />
t7 warrior (ghost face killah), t8 warrior(goats), t10 warrior (piggy) t11 dk.<br />
<br />
In my opinion everything but the helm looks good.<br />
Shoulders look decent but they could be a little bigger or more fiery. The helm is super boring... It needs some t6 face spikes added...<br />

When hunting it is advised to keep both eyes open in order to locate target after the shot.<br />
Also would impair perception.</div></div><hr />

This tier set actually makes me wish I got my war up to level. In my own eyes, easily without contest the best T12 set (and one of the best war sets to date).<br />
<br />
Hell, to any war bitching at this set, you made out pretty awesome. Be thankful you don't look like Hunters or DKs this time around (kings of goofy looking for T12)<br />
<br />
the rest of the sets so far have been meh, sorta middle of the road, not to bad, but nothing exciting.<br />

The colors will be just like they were for the last few sets of tier, a different color for each i level within the tier. One color for the entry iLvl, one the middle iLvl, and one for the heroic iLvl.<br />

I just wish the bellts looked like they fit better instead of sagging in the front like they currently do. Even on the draenei and the tauren, the largest player model bodies, the belts look like they are falling off.</div></div><hr />

... You know, you do understand that these are two completely different games right? With completely different capabilities? You know that those sort of graphics on your left will never, ever show up in WoW?<br />
<br />
If you are simply comparing the design and not the more detailed graphics, then the one for WoW fits this raid Tier far better.</div></div><hr />

What about 2011? I love the t12 and that other one looks nice to. You trying to turn people against it or bring them into rift or something? Oh and if the left picture was the warrior t12 people would still complain. Oh! let me try...<br />
<br />
The left one as to many spikes<br />
The left one looks to plain<br />
The left one looks like it only has 1 color<br />
The left one looks like to similar to that one thing<br />
<br />
WoW has it's own style to it just like Wind Waker did. They made Wind Waker to look all cartoony and it turned out very nice. Why choose a game just because of graphics? It could have the shittiest story line ever made and the shittiest game play around.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Let's compare 2 Zelda games i haven't played in a while.<br />
<br />
Twilight Princess - A lot more modern graphics i guess you could say and was fun and enjoyable<br />
Wind Waker - Cartoony looking but very fun and enjoyable<br />
<br />
I bet people would agree that graphics don't make the entire game (They do make some of it)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, to be fair, WoW's graphic system is quite outdated, and when it comes to design it's very subjective. A bit of relativity also comes into play. If you've played WoW enough, you get accustomed to the graphics and styles.<br />
<br />
Personally, though, I haven't played much at all in Cata partly due to my class' tier gear and what Blizz wants the Rogue class to become :p<br />

What, dont you like alladin? =P The full set should get you a carpet mount...<br />
<br />
The time sets were cool are long past. Unlikely we will see the ammount of creativity they had back at classic and tbc while designing sets. Having to theme sets after the instances (a lot of them awful) is also ruining it.<br />
<br />
I mean, when this warrior set and the paladin &quot;armor&quot; (seems more like pure cloth) are the top of the tier this far, then we know how messed their current design team is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am very disappointed in lately appeared Tiers after Cataclysm.<br />
They are each other same like, and that warriors set not to mention the priests Tier 12 head gear is a disaster.<br />
<br />
I suggest very strongly you go back to our beloved designers because you are running out of pick-up lines with currents.<br />
