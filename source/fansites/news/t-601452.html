I don't really see why Blizzard wanted to make a PTR patch for this, but I guess they've got their reasons.</div></div><hr />

::)<br />

<br />
* Improved the performance of conditional macros, slightly increasing the framerate.<br />
* Fixed a crash triggered by many unit frame AddOns.<br />
These two fixes alone justify a PTR testing period. Do you have any idea how much grief the Addon community has gone through trying to track down and fix these problems? It's not even certain the bug has been fixed. Now the Addon developers and testers can hop on the PTR to find out.<br />
<br />
Stop complaining about every little thing Blizzard does. They usually have good reasons.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2007-07-01, 02:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Add-on one is the only valid reason I see, conditional macros causing a &quot;slight&quot; framerate increase should be a known issue, anytime your pulling memory for a seperate action its going to take some off your framerate<br />
<br />
as for the Addon issue, I currently suffer this one from a few of my mods, but from what I saw so far, I was on earlier at 11am EST and there were only 11 70's online on PTR, is that really enough to test to make sure this bug is fixed?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mitko_A</div><div class="date">2007-07-01, 06:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's y you release a patch on the PTR with something like this + something catchy so ppl get on the PTRS</div></div><hr />
