you do not need to do this on multiple characters, its just story like previous similar quests</div></div><hr />

Was thinking the same. I stumbled over the quest and did it and the world died. Got teleported randomly around Suramar for 5 minutes before I decided to shut down the game for now. Now I can't back in.</div></div><hr />

Sargeras is the void's greatest threat. Of course they want us to take care of him. They send us away to take care of their enemy and they get free rein on Azeroth. Seems like a heady play.</div></div><hr />

I have been saying for a while that I predict we go to Argus to take care of Sargeras and come back to all hell breaking loose since Azeroths &quot;Protectors&quot; were off doing work and the big bad of the next expansion goes nuts on the world.</div></div><hr />

Thing is, if we don't take care of Sargeras, we are fucked regardless, so I don't see what that plot point would accomplish exactly.</div></div><hr />

If it's anything like the two class campaign quests in patch 7.1.5 that were a prelude to patch 7.2, I wouldn't count on it. I did the two on most of my characters, but some were not level 110 at the time and thus were ineligible. When I did get them to 110 after 7.2's release, the 7.1.5 quests never popped up.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The Diamond king has been made a pawn&quot; - those 2 sentences together...<br />
<br />
Man... That'd be genius.<br />
<br />
Imagine it's not Azeroth speaking but N'zoth faking everything, he sends us to fight Sargeras in Argus and whether we die there or not, Azeroth is pretty much exposed while we are all gone, the perfect opportunity to strike and be the main villain next expansion!<br />

I highly dislike having to level in the same zones, with the same quests and content on multiple characters, they really need to make character levels account-wide. Reputation and Gear while you're at it too, those get repetitive on alts too. /sarcasm<br />

You sound like you should stop playing this game if you're sick and tired of repeatedly doing the same thing on each of your alts. Or just stick to 1 character if you can't handle multiple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unlike the crowd here on MMO-C, most people won't play a game they don't enjoy playing, thus making time played rather than a sub (which can run without you logging in, duh) is the smarter choice. And of course they want us to spend as much time as possible in-game, us wanting to play = they earn money. <br />
<br />
If it's &quot;tedious&quot;, then don't do it. Can't fault the developers for learning their lesson from how WoD turned out with its &quot;maximum reward for minimum time spent&quot;-policy.<br />

Never seen such a message.<br />
<br />
However, there's a message about bringing your friends to Azeroth, but not forgetting to go outside with them as well. That message still pops up.<br />
Ty at least somebody who isn't completely stupid there is. <br />
<br />
They bitch about subs, they bitch about time spent in wow, they just bitch. <br />
<br />
Why about stop playing wow since you guys looks like a crack-head with a huge problem to get over your wow-addict?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I've heard how player engagement means time played, blah blah, It doesn't mean shit to an investor. If you play 1 hour a month or 200 hours a month, You are still worth 15 dollars.

Newsflash, but &quot;time spent&quot; in a game requiring a sub to access, is already quite self-explanatory as to why it's valuable information. The investors aren't being duped just because you're desperate for ways to downplay the success of the company.</div></div><hr />

Sure thing. I mean, it's not like it was used as the metric for a decade before people got worried that subs were dropped so low in WoD that they decided not to show the public them anymore. But sure, it's just a better way of measuring your money. God, this community sometimes.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;Blizzard are crooks!!!!!!&quot;-crowd will always make up new little lies in their minds.

You just made it clear that you're talking out of your ass. <br />
<br />
Sorry if the community at large won't buy into your tinfoil-hat stupidity and rather look at the official metrics and numbers. Again; A sub can run without a person even logging in to play the game. Thinking it's the ultimate way of gauging the health of a game is just asinine. Subs are also not the only revenue stream from this game.</div></div><hr />

You confuse your own peeves with the game for how everyone else feels. It alienating you for whatever reasons =/= it alienating everyone else. <br />
<br />
Your song has been sung since forever, yet the game is still around, it still pulls millions, it has hours spent out the wazoo. Giving feedback on what one dislikes on a personal level? Fine, we all do it. Acting like what you dislike about the game is bad for a fact? Not so much.

Difference here is that Legion, unlike past expansions, has gone to the extremes in keeping people to play for as much and as long as possible with grind and RNG literally everywhere, going well beyond to play on the player's compulsion with this &quot;Carrot on a stick&quot; approach throughout (They even stooped so low as to make reputation mounts RNG too ffs)...

<br />
You call it &quot;extremes&quot; and them &quot;keeping people&quot;, others would call it them making it possible to always have something to do in-game, after an expansion where the biggest single contributor to players leaving en masse, was the lack of shit to do. <br />
Most people are quite capable of turning off the game and not login should they not be enjoying what there is on offer. Most of the players are adults at that. You and other randoms on a forum don't need to assume the responsibility of managing the &quot;compulsion&quot; (will to play) of strangers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Blizzard delivers &quot;average playtime activity&quot; -&gt; Cry because you don't understand how it works but unless shut the fuck up just cry and show off how ignorant you can be and OFC cry about &quot;BLIZZARD FOOLING INVERSTORS!!!&quot;<br />

Yes it is extremes... Blizzard are pretty hopeless when it comes to finding a balance, it's always going from one side of the spectrum right towards the complete opposite end.<br />
<br />
WoD: &quot;Nothing to do!&quot;<br />
Legion: &quot;OMG Just stop piling all this on us!&quot; (Not gotten [any of] your stuff? Tough, here's more RNG! ~ Blizz)<br />
<br />
And I would have to mention about the player compulsion thing, as it affects me indirectly... I used to be a high-end raider, doing just Mythics. But I got demoted to social simply because I refused to burn myself out running older raids and all difficulties because of people wanting the chance of them Titanforged procs. (This damn system should've never gone beyond +10 from the base ilvl...)<br />

Nice, personal insults. It was fine metric for a decade before, but when subs go down to lowest ever, suddenly its the GO TO METRIC! Nice logic.<br />

Lowest ever since it's peak, here you go http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5063-WoW-Down-to-5-6-Million-Subscribers<br />
<br />
One of the last time subs were acutally reported. Lowest subs since december 2005 (Even though subs were going up at that time and would continue to go up until WotLK).<br />
<br />
It is not a coincidence that they report on a meaningless stat like &quot;time played&quot; to investors after that point or soon after.</div></div><hr />
