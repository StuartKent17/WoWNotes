Why don't you just let everyone buy whatever they like? Maybe people like this? Did that ever crossed your mind?<br />
<br />
PS: After this expansion there will be another. In order to buy the other expansion and play it you will have to buy this first. Guess you're just a stupid fanboI after all.</div></div><hr />

Yeah how is that? because they put a dragon design on a door and added a few cherry blossoms? okay, for the newness you see you can probably point out an equal amount of lack of detail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know that polygons are always perfectly flat right?<br />
they could of course put more polys in there to make it more round but it's probably done like this to keep the polycount low so relative slow computers can render it without much trouble.<br />
it has to do with the poly budget instead of lazyness.<br />
<br />
I like this screenshot though, it manages to grasp the asian style quite well.</div></div><hr />

Be sure to stop by each day for the latest look behind the veil of the expansion’s development progress.<br />
<br />
This statement was released on 30th April 2010 and might give us an inclination on the state of the expansion currently. The 30th of April was a week or two before the release of the Alpha of Cataclysm. This might mean we are 2 months or so ahead of Cataclysm's scedule. So perhaps an October release?</div></div><hr />

The expac is looking good. :D</div></div><hr />

I agree, it's def something they'll fix. I'm 99% sure there is a position in blizz where testers nitpick little details like that, many companies have it for commercials to make sure they don't portray anything in a negative light, or something that can be misinterpreted, the same will be done at some point I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

While I'm sure plenty of people will, a lot of people are also like me. I have never rushed to level cap on any expansion (and I've been playing since late Vanilla). I like to take my time in the new zones, collect the quests, explore the areas, and really take it all in. That's fun for me! Based on what we've seen so far, I'm really going to enjoy questing in Pandaria. Spots like this will be fun to pull out my toadstool and fish for a while. I'm tossin' my hat in the &quot;Looks good, I'm excited!&quot; ring here.</div></div><hr />

Hell, the door having to go through a rock in order to close was the first thing I noticed, and my finger twitched looking for a beta forum to post it on.<br />

We just going have to find that door and find out if rock is blocking the door or between the door gap. If it is rock and the door are touching each other, then we should report it to blizzard.<br />

You should check out some of the Developer Panels about level design from Blizzcon. They've majorly revamped how they actually create the world, and to be honest, it looks like a ton of fun to actually design this stuff with the proprietary Blizzard tools.<br />
<br />
The biggest advances they made were in how the work with ground textures, as they've almost completely and totally gotten away from the old 'make one small texture and repeat to infinity' process of texturing mountains and roads and such. It's actually really cool.</div></div><hr />

The engine actually has been receiving iterative improvements to its core with every single expansion. It is no longer the same engine it was when WoW released, it isn't even close. The lighting is vastly improved over the original game, for example, as are the ways in which it handles textures and models. The tools Blizzard uses to build the world are also completely new, barely even two years old, if we are to believe last Blizzcon. They have an entire team at Blizzard devoted solely to coding new kinds of world-building tools in fact.</div></div><hr />

That is like saying ...I can't even compare it to anything because the statement is just one big failure of a generalization of a complete idiot. I can say false stuff too like...Anyone who has cancer will die, no matter what. <br />

I believe the people keeping the game alive are the people here for the social aspect, because most of them are casuals.

So..No..Not everyone who is here for the social aspect will quit before it launches, and I bet most that quit will come running back. <br />

well at least you go on to prove that you can say false things by claiming that &quot;casuals normally enjoy the game waaay more than someone who is elitist or hardcore.&quot; I don't think it's fair to claim that either player enjoys the game more, and I guarantee you'd be hard pressed to find information backing your statement. just because elitists take certain aspects of the game seriously doesn't mean they aren't enjoying themselves. go look up the word &quot;competitive.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I pretty sure they upgrade the graphics engine each expansion. I know they did for Cataclysm and they announced some additional render effects at BlizzCon to be released with Mist.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2012-03-13, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They upgrade the engine all the time and sometimes between expansions, they just don't upgrade the style much which has always been cartoonish. That's why the change to water effects back during Wrath were out of sorts with the rest of the environment - realistic effects in a cartoon style setting. Someone earlier encouraged someone to find fault with it. Ok, it's not near the quality you would find in more advanced engines in most games today but it's pretty good for people running on lower end video processors (I guess, I've always kept mine up to date) since they tend to make their engine to be compatible within about 5 years so it can appeal to a very broad audience - which may explain why it's the most popular MMO. If you're running a bad/old GPU you really can't play the latest titles.</div></div><hr />

You're a funny guy. Vanilla WoW didn't look remotely like this. It's not a case of rose colored glasses - anybody is free to google old Vanilla screenshots.

there is a reason they are testing a 64 bit client now. One of the things discussed at blizzcon was the games requirements going up in MoP. Namely they said they will be doubling farclip (view distance), adding new blending effects, and no doubt using a much greater polygon count. Point being. the game is going to need to cache a whole lot more. A lot of ram and vram will go a long way in MoP. I can easily use 2.4gigs in 32 bit mode now with large address aware 32 bit client. 64 bit client inherently uses a litte more, add in a new ultra setting that will use even more then that. you will see a 3.5 gig large address aware limit in 32 bit app real quick. So yes, they definitely consider these things :)</div></div><hr />

Well, if this picture is the last nail in your decision to not buy MoP, then you won't be missed very much.</div></div><hr />

Trees have never been blizzards best work imo with WoW, the engine is old, they probably can't do much better.<br />
<br />
I will say though, I like the screen shot, looks good so far.</div></div><hr />

It is just a goddamn gate and as various others have pointed out it doesn't make sense because it doesn't fit.<br />
So please stop acting like 12 y o fanboys. There is no point in 100+ comments of people stating they &quot;love it&quot;.<br />

Yes because somebody liking something clearly means they're a 12-year-old fanboy. Not that, maybe, I don't know...they actually like it. No. That can't be it. <br />
<br />
I like it. I'm 31 years old. Come at me, bro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, because people aren't allowed to like anything in this game right? Heaven forbid the people commenting ACTUALLY like it as it is a VAST improvement to the game. Lets be internet cool guy who hates wow because its the cool thing to do and slam people because they have a mind to think for themselves and comment how they really feel.<br />
<br />
Im 30, I like this game and I love that picture. Umad?</div></div><hr />

Exactly my first impression &quot;how the hell do they close it with all the items blocking the door leaf. At least the trees looks better now :)</div></div><hr />

From this very specific angle. Walk a few yards to the side and I'm sure there will be giant box cutouts of the tree like there are on the old trees. Even on the old trees, from the perfect angle, look nice.</div></div><hr />
