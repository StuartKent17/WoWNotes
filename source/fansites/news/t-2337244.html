Christie Golden's Before the Storm Delayed<br />
Christie Golden's upcoming novel Before the Storm (http://amzn.to/2ywUb30) has been delayed until June 12, 2018. It was originally scheduled to release on May 15, 2018.<br />
<br />
Amazon doesn't have the official cover art yet, but it was posted on Twitter (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7147-Antorus-Raid-Release-Date-Before-the-Storm-Cover-Art-Blue-Post). The book description was updated, but you can see the original description here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7088-Before-the-Storm-Patch-7-3-Character-Races-Build-of-the-Month-Subrace-Fan-Art).<br />
<br />
An all-new, official prequel novel to The Battle for Azeroth, Blizzard Entertainment’s next expansion to the critically acclaimed World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
In Before the Storm, Anduin Wrynn, king of Stormwind, and Sylvanas Windrunner, warchief of the Horde, are new to their positions of power, both ascending before they were truly prepared. As the Alliance and the Horde struggle to recover from the devastating war with the demonic Burning Legion, a terrible discovery will test both leaders, threatening to reignite the bitter enmity between their factions and shake the very foundations of the world of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Developer Interviews<br />
We're continuing to take a look at new information from the BlizzCon developer interviews. Automatic Jak (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj2YSBC-XiI) talked to Sigma at Blizzcon 2017.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The team went into Legion knowing that they might have to revisit some of the classes that received major changes once player feedback was collected.<br />
There most likely will not be complete class revamps again any time soon.<br />
Mythic dungeons are a great way to show off each class’s unique toolkit.<br />
The team likes classes having unique abilities.<br />
Going forward a big question is what unique abilities each class should have.<br />
The team wants to spread out class strength and weaknesses more.<br />
Utility will be spread out and balanced more in the future.<br />
Everyone should feel like they have some sort of cooldown to help them survive.<br />
The best thing the team can do to help showcase unique abilities is to have more variety in dungeon encounters.<br />
Talent tweaks and the future of the class artifact abilities are being looked at moving forward.<br />
The passive health increase on Artifact Weapons was essentially to also help healers heal into a set of players with higher health pools who take more damage that stays balanced with the amount of healing done.<br />
Thorns and other design elements are being experimented with more to counter the issue of healing getting boring as players get stronger.<br />
The team is pretty happy with where raid cooldowns are at now.<br />
Steady damage is important to the design of healing in encounters.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Vol'jin status: still dead, not letting that stop him (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/926538661277048834))<br />
<br />
Thanks all for another incredible BlizzCon full of excitement and hugs. I love this community so much! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927249082917142528))<br />
Was talking back stage with one of the convention organizers, who works on several big conventions... he said something that made me think. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927249707511902208))<br />
&quot;You look at big cons like ComicCon, E3, GamesCom, ChinaJoy... those are for hundreds of games/things. BlizzCon is for 5 games [franchises]&quot; (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927250368643268608))<br />
&quot;BlizzCon matches them in scale (with the new North Hall), with just 5 games. It's incredible.&quot;, he said. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927250594854723584))<br />
It really is incredible. It's because of the people. The community. The FAMILY. I am so honored to have the privilege to contribute to it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/927251109948768256))<br />
<br />
In a creative industry, it's valuable to let your creatives take some time every cycle to work on whatever they're passionate about. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925209563141251072))<br />
WoW's level designers took on crafting the oceans of Broken Isles as a fun project once pencils were down for most of the world. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925210061835603968))<br />
I'd encourage everyone to take a swim, you'll find all kinds of cool little moments, and giant pearls, and salty krakens, and passion/love. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925210325992927232))<br />
Plus it drives the Secret Finding Discord nuts so, bonus (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925222028403027968))<br />
<br />
I would consider everyone a creative - designers, artists, engineers can be creative, even producers with their multi-colored spreadsheets! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925224112590438401))<br />
Did you know that Gull Rock in Stormheim was created by a producer that wanted to see what would happen if he learned to add seagulls? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925224438387245056))<br />
The result was a LOT of seagulls, who were then eaten by Falcosaurs. Never forget the look he gave me when I told him they ate his seagulls (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925225275423571968))<br />
A combination of unfathomable sadness and &quot;did you have time for that, let me consult my spreadsheet&quot; (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/925227433493544961))<br />

Then why does my Shadow Priest only have something that barely reduces damage taken while silencing me for the whole duration ?<br />

Then we'd deal with all our villains in 2 expansions. What else would their be? It's important to develop the characters and stories we have now so there's some breadth. Otherwise we'd just be dealing with the same thing over and over again, just skinned differently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But isn't that what BfA is essentially? A reskin of the Horde instigates a war, alliance reacts plot of MoP? And then both sides go on to recruit the locals and set up a presence on the new continent? Also I'm not sure if it's character or story development if they completely drop the Genn and Sylvanas story thread in Stormheim then suddenly set us up a Garrosh by making Sylvanas, who was working with Varian in the opening cinematic of Legion, have sudden desires to conquer Stormwind as opposed to supporting her people as she always has in a book no less. Not to mention Teldrassil being razed out of nowhere and Anduin suddenly becoming a Warrior-priest hybrid out of nowhere. That's more like let's make huge story leaps with little to no build up as it's easier for us that way.</div></div><hr />

That said, she has never shown any interest in lore in comic, and would absolutely be standing on top of a burning Teldrassil.</div></div><hr />

Orcs bad guys, attack first. Humans good guys, defend their land from evil. Orcs ultimately lose due to infighting and betrayal from within. It wasn't until WC3 that orcs were anything but always chaotic evil bloodthirsty monsters.</div></div><hr />

I think it's going to be a change in one of the following.<br />
<br />
1. Who attacked first and why<br />
2. Void elf lore change<br />
3. Night elves are going to be written to do something<br />

<br />
Garrosh didnt get corrupted. He willingly infused himself with the essence of the Old God in a bid for power and domination. Just like his dear old daddy did (except that was demon blood). However, unlike daddy he was unwilling to finally see the error in his quest for power and instead blamed others for for his path. It was a nice juxtaposition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, he corrupted himself. Regardless of that the Old Gods were involved and the last boss of the expansion had nothing to do with the initial premise of the expansion.<br />
<br />
No reason BfA can't end up in an Old God invasion or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So I guess we can take from this that Blizzard really likes to reuse the Horde started it plot. The older RTSes, WotLK with Wrathgate, Pandaria and it's whole plot and now BfA again. You'd think at one point they could try the morally grey war story as opposed to another one where one faction is painted as the villain and the other in the right.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wonder why the book is delayed, thought she already tweeted that she finished it? I guess it's to better coincide with the expansion release.<br />

If she had, it's possible someone high up on the writing team actually read through it all and went &quot;um no&quot; and asked for some major rewrites. A two month delay would suggest some major work has to be done on it as opposed to some fixing, grammer checks and plot consistency (haha who am I kidding Golden doesn't really care about that, also bet it had something to do with an AnduinxGenn fanfic level of writing). I mean Blizzard rarely releases their books based on when an expansion releases so why would they start now?</div></div><hr />

You're the one who brought up the irrelevant point of character vs. player distinction, so I dunno why you're now complaining about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty stupid statement and or design goal. <br />
Players should be easier to heal when they get more powerful, until new content is released and the cycle starts again. <br />
A system where everything scales and you are always getting crushed no matter how much gear/power you acrue is not a fun system to play in.</div></div><hr />

There is a character.<br />

On the contrary, there is no human, it's a character in a comic about WoW.</div></div><hr />

Have you read those comics? It's a comic about gamers playing WoW. They're talking about raiding and such...UI...etc. all the time. So, what they're saying is that it's a real human playing a Night Elf character.</div></div><hr />

So I guess we can take from this that Blizzard really likes to reuse the Horde started it plot. The older RTSes, WotLK with Wrathgate, Pandaria and it's whole plot and now BfA again. You'd think at one point they could try the morally grey war story as opposed to another one where one faction is painted as the villain and the other in the right.<br />
<br />
The old world Cataclysm revamp there was a lot of grey. Even in the Barrens. At Honor Point you have the Alliance taking over a Horde outpost, holding all its people hostage. The captain horrifically beats the prisoners and when one protects the beat of another, the captain beats him until he's permanently blinded. The questgiver who sends you to kill the captain is disgusted by this and can't believe the Captain's superiors know what he's doing.<br />
<br />
On the other end of the zone the small orc clan laying siege to Northwatch is apparently into cannibalism and wears a man's scalp as his helmet.<br />

It's a trope. http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainsActHeroesReact<br />
Also a good dose of http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/YouCantThwartStageOne<br />
<br />
Typically the darker faction is the one who initiates a plot, and has a good deal of success before the heroes have a chance to stop anything they do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2017-11-14, 02:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But isn't that what BfA is essentially? A reskin of the Horde instigates a war, alliance reacts plot of MoP? And then both sides go on to recruit the locals and set up a presence on the new continent? Also I'm not sure if it's character or story development if they completely drop the Genn and Sylvanas story thread in Stormheim then suddenly set us up a Garrosh by making Sylvanas, who was working with Varian in the opening cinematic of Legion, have sudden desires to conquer Stormwind as opposed to supporting her people as she always has in a book no less. Not to mention Teldrassil being razed out of nowhere and Anduin suddenly becoming a Warrior-priest hybrid out of nowhere. That's more like let's make huge story leaps with little to no build up as it's easier for us that way.<br />
<br />
Apparently something happens, before the cinematic, that explains it - and you can find out for yourself for the low, low price of $25 ($14 Kindle) in Christy Golden's new WoW fan fict...er, novel, &quot;Before The Storm!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Good news: They explain it.<br />
<br />
Bad news: The person explaining it is Christy Golden.<br />

The delayed release date of the book would seem to indicate that the Expansion won't be out until at least July 2018, as they will want the book out on the shelves before then to build up hype.<br />
<br />
There is no way it's being released before September 2018. We go through this every period before an expansion, the calculations for release are either extremely pessimistic, or incredibly optimistic. I'd bet on September/October. 8-9 months is a good amount of breathing room for people to catch up alts, and average guilds to tackle the entire raid progression.<br />

<br />
The team went into Legion knowing that they might have to revisit some of the classes that received major changes once player feedback was collected.<br />
<br />
Gee, ya think? They weren't done at release. They still aren't really done. They bit off WAY more than they could chew. <br />
<br />
There most likely will not be complete class revamps again any time soon.<br />
<br />
Thank god. They completely screwed the pooch in Legion, in terms of class revamps, they created enormous amounts of instability doing it the way they did it. I don't even play anymore, and I feel relieved at this.</div></div><hr />

That'd be true if it were the game.<br />
<br />
This is one of the guild members' interpretation of their guild members actions, displayed in comic format.<br />
<br />
It is not Gigz making the panel. It is DLC's creator portraiting Gigz in the way he/she sees Gigz acting in game and on voice.<br />
<br />
No matter how you look at it, the Gigz in the comic is not even somewhat relatable to the human who plays Gigz and in no way, shape, or form is involved in how the character in the comic acts.<br />
<br />
But I digress, this whole tangent that spawned off a troll response is getting tiresome.</div></div><hr />
