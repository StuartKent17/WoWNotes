<br />
Season 3 Gear rating requirement in Season 4<br />
Shoulders requirement will be lowered to 1950 Personal Arena Rating, weapons to 1800.<br />
There will be no changes to gear availability/rating requirement until Season 4 starts, which will not begin when patch 2.4 goes live.<br />
<br />
When Season 4 starts here's what will happen:<br />
Season 1 removed<br />
Season 2 moved to honor<br />
Season 3 rating requirements and prices lowered<br />
<br />
Shoulders : 1950 rating<br />
Weapons : 1800 rating<br />
Season 4 gear added<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 4 isn't expected to begin any time soon, but as always we plan to give at least a two week notice before it does. Stay tuned to these forums or any of your fine local fansites as I'm sure the information will spread fairly rapidly once we do announce a Season 4 start date.<br />
<br />
Season 3 prices and Season 4 rating requirements are not yet announced. All information contained herein is of course, as always, subject to change.<br />
<br />
What about the S1 Gear being removed ?<br />
You get to keep your items of course, they'll just no longer be available for purchase from the vendors. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5286577719&amp;postId=53773201214&amp;sid=1#44))<br />
<br />
<br />
First &quot;real&quot; screenshot of Kil'jaeden ?<br />
I got an interesting mail a few hours ago, with a nice screenshot attached. According to the sender this is a leaked screenshot from a GM, I won't fully confirm it but it definitely looks legit enough to be posted. Keep in mind that it could be a fake, it's not &quot;that&quot; hard to get the 2.4 running on an emulated server and spawn Kil'jaeden, in this case his scale on live servers could be different.<br />

Do away with the rating. <br />

<br />
Why keep rating on S3 at all? It'll be inferior to S4 anyways, so this change is just pointless. Remove the rating already. The serious PvPers have already had it for showoff for quite a long time if they've put their hearts into it, and they'll have S4 shoulders and weapons in no time in any case.</div></div><hr />

Is there anyone out there who will seriously consider the 50 point difference enough to compensate for inferior weapons? I'm not saying they should do away with the rating. I'm saying that it should be something, you know, not retarded like this. 1700/1850 seemed pretty logical to me, because it drops the shoulders to a rating requirement once held by the weapons, and the weapons become much more available. If I had a preference, it would be to have the weapons be available at 1650 and the shoulders at 1750.</div></div><hr />

Stop punishing players for playing with their friends by placing ratings requirements on gear. We earn the points, so we should be able to spend them as we see fit.<br />

Although many of us [i]could[i] join some highly rated team if we [i]wished[i] to, many of us choose not to join a team that takes arenas so seriously, hence we'll probably never hit an 1800+ rating.

Not available from Vendors, just like Veterans gear is no longer available.<br />

And I do agree, the 50 points drop is a pretty worthless change unless the S4 requirements are going to be something like 2k for weapons, and 2250 for shoulders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll still need to win at least 60% of the game to maintain a rating of 1600 nowadays, and you really can't maintain that rating if you have anything less than S2 and/or most ideal team setup. So really you are not that good and they are not as bad as you think. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as i know Kalgan plays a warrior, this is why they dont get nerfed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior is already very nerfed. Cry more?<br />
<br />
Just because you are beaten on equipment and teamwork doesn't mean the warrior class is OP. Several classes can hit much harder than geared warrior in melee when you put the per attack damage of the 2 classes side by side, and most of them got more utility.<br />
<br />
Just because you fail to kite a class that is supposed to be kited doesn't mean the class owes you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mazorp</div><div class="date">2008-03-20, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1650 and 1800 on the S3 gear would be fine with me personally. Those rating can be easily obtained by your slightly above average player, but put them out of reach from the scrubs who lose 10 games a week. Those rating would also mean that many would see have a REASON to get S3 in those slots.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2008-03-20, 03:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arena has two failings.<br />
<br />
1. Only the most skilled players get the best gear with the ridiculous effect of putting a handicap on the underdog.<br />
2. The least skilled players can still get many incredibly good items making a total joke of much of the PvE progression.<br />
<br />
The problem is that if they make the gear easier to get it exacerbates problem two, if they make it harder to get it exacerbates problem one.<br />
<br />
To make everyone happy they need to give out less gear and reduce the poor player handicap. The only way to do this is to normalize the gear inside the arena. The simple way is to just make a standard set of gear for each class that you get when you go to arena. For slightly more effort they can either make an arena waiting room where you can get whatever enchanted top tier arena gear you want but it cannot be worn outside the waiting area or the arena.<br />
<br />
If you want to go further and still encourage BG participation you can easily just upgrade any previous season gear to the top season gear inside the arena.<br />
<br />
This solves every problem.<br />
<br />
First, it means that arena will tend to be much more skill based since the gear difference will be totally eliminated.<br />
Second, it means they can make the reward for arena victory be the ability to wear that gear outside the arenas. This allows them to make the gear much harder to get. Being able to make the gear harder to get also appeases the PvE guilds since they won't all be outgeared by people who just lose some arenas once a week. <br />
<br />
Just as an addendum here is my pet theory why they haven't done such a thing, since it is pretty obvious that that is the solution and they must be aware of it. My theory is that Blizzard are well aware that gear plays a much bigger part in victory than many of the PvPers like to admit. The system as it stands means that those who spend most time doing PvP will tend to have the most success in PvP. This makes the PvPers happy since those who are hardcore into their PvP will tend to do very well at it. If they normalize the gear inside the arenas a lot of those who live and breathe for arena are going to suddenly find themselves losing a lot more to the very scrub teams their gear used to allow them to steamroller. In effect, the artificial gear handicap serves to make PvP more rewarding for those who are most interested in PvP and Blizzard seem to be loath to upset this situation.</div></div><hr />

Bollocks, you can get to 1850 no problem in full season 1, especially as the current-season equivalent (boots / belt / bracers) etc, make up for a large part of your gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;see it form far distance&quot;... WHO F*CKIN CARES what u SEE !<br />
<br />
And as sidenotes:<br />
<br />
- My warriors old S2 shoulders were much more recognizable form far away than my current S3 shoulders are. So following urs and Blizzards &quot;logic&quot; I got my 2000 PR shoulders to be recognized LESS than with the older one that didnt have any PR at all ?<br />
<br />
- U know any PvE loot where the boss is extremly hard because the item(s) he drops LOOKS good ? Tier gloves drops from the easier bosses, shoulders from the medicore and helm/chest/pants from the harder bosses... u know why ? cause hands give the least increase, shoulders a medicore and helm/chest/pants the most. logic can be so easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
actually it's not irony but the reason blizzard itself gave for the rating needed for the shoulders. It is the most visible armor part and thus only elite should have it. It was in a blue post when s3 was about to start.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpohagan</div><div class="date">2008-03-20, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arena has two failings.<br />
<br />
1. Only the most skilled players get the best gear with the ridiculous effect of putting a handicap on the underdog.<br />
2. The least skilled players can still get many incredibly good items making a total joke of much of the PvE progression.<br />
<br />
The problem is that if they make the gear easier to get it exacerbates problem two, if they make it harder to get it exacerbates problem one.<br />
<br />
To make everyone happy they need to give out less gear and reduce the poor player handicap. The only way to do this is to normalize the gear inside the arena. The simple way is to just make a standard set of gear for each class that you get when you go to arena. For slightly more effort they can either make an arena waiting room where you can get whatever enchanted top tier arena gear you want but it cannot be worn outside the waiting area or the arena.<br />
<br />
If you want to go further and still encourage BG participation you can easily just upgrade any previous season gear to the top season gear inside the arena.<br />
<br />
This solves every problem.<br />
<br />
First, it means that arena will tend to be much more skill based since the gear difference will be totally eliminated.<br />
Second, it means they can make the reward for arena victory be the ability to wear that gear outside the arenas. This allows them to make the gear much harder to get. Being able to make the gear harder to get also appeases the PvE guilds since they won't all be outgeared by people who just lose some arenas once a week. <br />
<br />
Just as an addendum here is my pet theory why they haven't done such a thing, since it is pretty obvious that that is the solution and they must be aware of it. My theory is that Blizzard are well aware that gear plays a much bigger part in victory than many of the PvPers like to admit. The system as it stands means that those who spend most time doing PvP will tend to have the most success in PvP. This makes the PvPers happy since those who are hardcore into their PvP will tend to do very well at it. If they normalize the gear inside the arenas a lot of those who live and breathe for arena are going to suddenly find themselves losing a lot more to the very scrub teams their gear used to allow them to steamroller. In effect, the artificial gear handicap serves to make PvP more rewarding for those who are most interested in PvP and Blizzard seem to be loath to upset this situation.<br />
<br />
<br />
That argument sounds pretty enticing, but you do that and the game will cease to be a Massively Multiplayer Online ROLE PLAYING GAME. This type of game is about character progression, i.e. about putting work in, progressing by attaining more gear. If you want instanced gear in addition to instanced pvp scenarios, go and play a fps. This is pretty much the fundamental problem with what Blizzard is trying to do with pvp: It is wholly inconsistent with the type of game they've made. You take away the sense of achievement felt from actually earning gear (and sure the pro-pvers would argue that pvp gear isn't earnt at all), and you won't really have much of a motivation to keep playing. <br />
<br />
I'm solely a pvper nowadays (due to real life commitments I can't afford to commit so much time to a computer game - i.e. a pve guild), but I guarantee that if gear became instanced the game would be straight boring. I guess thats the extreme end of the commitment (pve) -------&gt; casual spectrum.<br />
<br />
But anyway, the below blog makes a similar argument:<br />

Well look at it this way. On my lock I have over 1200 shadow damage in my PVE gear. I have a couple S1 and a couple S3 items and I am happy if I can just maintain a rating of 1500 and maybe hit 1600. Yes I suck. There is only one item I need from arenas for my lock and that is the weapon. So this just means I will stop playing arenas with my lock, because I suck and I can't get a good rating to even get the old S3 weapon<br />
<br />
My paladin is prot, I heal in arenas, and I am not willing to spend the money every week to change spec constantly. My team gets around 1450 rating. I only want the shield. Why should I build up a gladiator healing set so that I can get my tanking shield? So I will just stop playing arenas with my paladin. <br />
<br />
Now think about it. There are probably 1000 2v2 teams in my battlegroup with prot paladins or prot warriors that just do it for the shield. How many 2v2 teams have casters geared like my lock? Maybe another 1000 2v2 teams? So easily 2000 less 2v2 teams might play now in my battelgroup. So there will be less of us that suck for the good teams to win against. It is now just going to make it so much more difficult for the teams to get a good rating, because the people that suck don't play anymore</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This is an interesting change. I think we'll see 2000 req for s4 weapons and 2150 rating for the shoulders, or along those lines. It seems that they want to make Crown Jewels only to give them to the absolute best. And this is the first hint that something in this game will still be really hard to get.<br />

Couldnt agree less with you. PVE players should never be able to get good gear from PVP by just loling in arena, never ever. That is just lol that you can get a shield for example with 5900 armor by just doing some weekly matches, a shield that is equal in terms of armor and sta as Hyjal shield that requires 25 man geared up and that have raided for months. IMO weapons should be at 2200+ and shouders 2300+ or something. Like in the old days were only a handful of people had the R14 weapons. It was really disgusting to see a green lev 60 player walking around with the R14 sword when the new honor system first was released.<br />

Did it ever occur to you that not everyone should get the same rewards for just &quot;waiting out the seasons&quot; ? I love this change personally. More rating requirements on gear would actually make it GREAT to hit 1700 for that chestpiece or whatever. It would be more like killing a new raidboss than collecting badges.</div></div><hr />

Yep, reminded me of finally getting rank 11 for the mount and rank 12 for parts of the epic gear, trying to &quot;make it&quot; was what made the old system great. The downside of that system was that it was not compatible with having other things to do in your life if you wanted to get to the top.</div></div><hr />

I personally think that these ratings are maybe even too low, the cost of the weapon should be closer to 2000 then getting the weapon and shoulders could be called an achievement. And no, i dont have a arenateam even close to 1850.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps some rating - like 1650 for the weapons, 1800 for the shoulders - would be appropriate to keep the losing teams from getting the gear. But then, think about the BoJ loot that will be available in 2.4 which is even much earlier than S4. An S3 quality 2h axe for 150 BoJs? You don't need to be good in any way to get it, even less so than in arena, you just need time. Seems to me they finally gave in to the pve players whining about the ease of getting gear through arena.</div></div><hr />

Yes the hit rating is very important, but at 500 to 700 ms lag and a lock + paladin group vs warrior/druid, rogue/druid in almost every game it really is impossible for me to get 1600 and since I will not be able to get any gear on my lock in arenas that actually beats PVE gear then there is no reason for me to even play arenas on my lock. Same goes for my prot paladin. I want only one item and that is the shield. I was willing to take 3 months of sucking at a 1400 rating playing 20 to 30 games a week to get the shield, but since I will never be able to get the shield I have no reason to go play and constantly suck</div></div><hr />

What the hell is the point of Lowering the Rating needed to buy S3 gear by only 50 points, you just might as well go for the S4 crap, I mean honestly are they that stupid?!?

Just because they're one season outdated it doesn't mean they completely suck and any nub should have access to it.<br />
<br />
It's like... why would the hardcore pve'ers spent hours and hours raiding BT for T6 gear, when t6 would be released in kara (accessable for anyone) a month later?<br />
<br />
Keep it up, Blizz.<br />
<br />
<br />
How about T6 equivalent gear for badges from Kara? Oh wait!</div></div><hr />

You can still have the S4 shoulders to show off with. Being older doesn't make the S3 shoulders suck, but they aren't the status icon they used to be, are they? The issue with rating is obvious if you're one of the less fortunate on a realm that is absolutely dead pvp-wise. It can be very hard to find a proper team, and even then you're competing against lots of ideal setups like warrior/druid. And that's not to say warriors are OP, I think it's actually the resto druids that are.</div></div><hr />

Yes you guys are wonderful and awesome and all that. Us sucky players get +-200 points a week. So we are willing to spend 13 weeks to try and get the weapon and allow you guys to climb over us. In that time you already bought every item so why do you care? How many of the 2000 rated teams actually go make new teams just to walk over the 1500's? I would imagine many of the if you look at the win/loss ratings. These are people that already sit at a high rating with awesome pvp gear and just really go rape the sucky people, because it is fun for them.<br />
<br />
How many teams did you play that sucked to get to your 2000 rating? I know I sucked so I probably gave you your 15 points. So you need to rather thank me and people like me than saying we aren't allowed to get out dated gear compared to your gear.<br />
<br />
In my PVE guild I don't think any team is in the 1500 range even. Most of the guys hang around the 1300 or 1400 rating. How did they get there? They fought people like you. You gained your points and they lost their points. Blizzard is removing the carrot for all of them to still play. So now imagine what will happen to your rating when all the people you climbed over don't play anymore and only people in the 1700+ bracket play. <br />
<br />
The 1700's will end up in the 1400's and you will end up in the 1700's, because now you have the best competing against the best and no more sucky players to climb over. <br />
<br />
So yes you guys might love showing off or what ever, but you need to remember how you where able to get where you are. Most of the pve guys I know don't care who gets what from arenas or badges. Get what you can get. It has to do with doing what ever you can to progress in the game.</div></div><hr />

well it would only be like 3-4 weeks for a cheaper item, the weapon would take 13 weeks, however you would need 1850 rating for that, which it seems like you wouldn't have :/ no offense of course, just calling it as i see it.</div></div><hr />

indeed, i understand your position. my mage is probably the same, short of getting carried to 1850, i will be in a few s3 pieces + 0.5 set in 2.4, and maybe some honor pieces if i have time to farm it. point being with rating requirements i am still stuck farming loads of honor to get season s2 pieces to be in a place to get the rating for s3. <br />

If you checked right there actually are highrated lock/warr 2v2 teams, but that doesn't mean they're overpowered. Its more like they have the decent amount of skills needed for that, while lock/druid or warr/druid isn't juuuust as skill required.</div></div><hr />

The simple way is to just make a standard set of gear for each class that you get when you go to arena. For slightly more effort they can either make an arena waiting room where you can get whatever enchanted top tier arena gear you want but it cannot be worn outside the waiting area or the arena.<br />

<br />
<br />
This is what the TTR does. Besides, the blue level 70 pvp gear will be available through honored reputation with various factions, which means for pretty much everyone because you can get honored without even trying. That will at least give everyone a little bit of resilience and some more stam right when they hit 70.</div></div><hr />

There isnt any, if you can reach 1800 you can reach 1850 aswell.<br />
Who would buy S3 shoulders/weaps if you can get S4 stuff? Hardly anyone.<br />

So S4 is likely to have higher ratings recuired then S3 currently does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This issue did catch my attention enough to want to have my say and I would urge Blizzard to take it on board...<br />
<br />
Im a pretty casual gamer, not into PvP that much (altho it is a great way to fill in 'blanks' and can be a laugh, consider me joe-gamer with roughly average skills, at least in PvP)<br />
<br />
My mage at the moment has just over 7k hp and I believe 18 Resi (yes, safely in LoLvile, I know), I am very much PvE geared/spec'd and dont wish to pour a lot of time grinding honor to get sta and resi up - which is essential arena stats as we all know. (Reason for this btw is Im an alt-aholic, with many 70's I cant do all things to all chars XD) Dont worry, there is a point in here somewhere.... -&gt;<br />
<br />
Atm, I play 2v2 with my bf who isnt that good ;-p our rating is floating around 1400, no complaints there we arent geared for it and lack experience... BUT, once we have both gained some exp and some item upgrades I still wouldnt expect us going much past the 1600-1700 mark. To think that even down the road after exp/gear'ing up and then time spent pushing that rating up, we wont even be within a mile of LAST SEASONS items is actually depressing.<br />
<br />
I understand the need for a rating system and there should be some structure in place, but currently (nor it seems in the future) there are no goals for the casual average PvPer :/ This is what I would have hoped S3 would become. Lets face it, you need nothing more than TIME to get S2 (even now and indeed come S4 launch), S4 will be the new latest-and-greatest in the PvP world and well you should have to work hard for it, but having S3 a fraction below S4 makes no sense and excludes the bracket I believe Im in (and Im sure Im not alone there).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont think so; they just keep it up till the broad mass of top players &amp; jobless ppl who have time to play wow the whole day has their S4 shoulders &amp; weapons to make them feel special again and then they will lower the S3 ratings so that casuals get em.</div></div><hr />

This means that there will be NO DIFFERENCE, in shoulder and weapon, between a person who works hard but can't pass 1850 rating...<br />

I'm sorry, but I shouldn't have to be stuck with the same pair of shoulders as every BG scrub in the game, simply because I can't get past all the team-sellers, point-sellers, and general asshole S3 teams that come back to 1500 to stomp me.</div></div><hr />

They clearly said that shoulders should show an achievement in pve or pvp.<br />
<br />
s3 shoulder = ilvl 146 = t6 skin<br />
t6 shoulder = ilvl 146 = end of BT to get<br />
<br />
s3 is the equivalent of t6 so it should be as hard as having t6 shoulder, according to wowjutsu ONLY 6.2% of the guilds are killing mother shahraz (94.5% of the guilds are killing prince malchezaar for exemple).<br />
<br />
So isn't it logical that 6.2% of the pvp guild or pvp players should have s3 shoulder ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selenti</div><div class="date">2008-03-20, 06:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">People are misrepresenting this. It's not like players who can't get 1850 are stuck in S2 forever. They can buy all the new badge gear that is T6 equivelant. The weapons are just as good in terms of DPS as S3. They can buy all of S3 except the shoulders and weapon. Actually, they can buy all of S4 other than the shoulders/weapon, which will be even better. It's really not that bad. Things are amazing right now for casual or mediocre players, they're being handed gear left and right.</div></div><hr />

It's like its easy to get 1800 and very hard to get 50 more rating :-X<br />
<br />
1700 or 1650 for both weapons as shoulders should have been fine imo, since now the shoulders/weapons are still hard to get for alot of ppl and why should gear which is not the very best still be very hard to get? tho, I can see why this is done, since T5 still isn't easy to get for alot of ppl while it's not the best pve gear too...maybe that's the reason?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">salty</div><div class="date">2008-03-20, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm am highly annoyed with BoJ trashing, specifically the off-handed dismissal of the difficulty of acquiring them and the ridiculous claims that it poses any threat whatsoever to raiding or PvP.<br />
<br />
The currency of PvP gear can be snoozed - arena points and honor can be earned through continuous failure and AFKing. High rating requirement is all that keeps PvP from being the preferred path of gearing over raiding, god I hope they keep the standard high. And even with those conditions in place, PvP gear sucks for PvE - lack of hit rating basically guarantees you will not top charts or play special roles in pure PvP gear (gg missing on your MDs, taunts, dot uptime cycles with cooldowns, etc). Furthermore, the fact that the stat budget for resilience and stamina handily dulls DPS attributes and resilience is a joke for tanking, providing no dodge or parry bonus to weigh it against defense rating (and with capped defense, resilience is literally useless). Only PvP healing gear pulls its weight in PvE... except for the crappy mana efficiency. <br />
<br />
As far as BoJ rewards go... starting with 0 badges, you will be hard pressed to buy that 150 badge weapon in less than 4 or 5 weeks with Kara and ZA on farm, meanwhile you can easily collect at least 1 upgrade per week in a raid, especially when you break through to new tiers of content.<br />
<br />
Despite what people say about theoretical calculations about how many badges someone can earn in a week &quot;casually,&quot; one Karazhan clear, two ZA clears and a couple of heroics is NOT casual by any definition of the word -- that's the damn truth. That is a raider -- even if they're not on T5/T6, a casual is not a raider so go ahead and discount ZA from that list. Furthermore if they're not raiders, chances are they aren't going in for weekly Kara clears or at least full Kara clears. A few heroics here and there is not going to deck you out in T6 in any quick timescale. One T6 upgrade every 4 or 5 weeks is no threat to anybody's BT/Hyjal farming and damn sure not going to get anybody warglaives, set bonuses or a head-to-pinky T6 outfit. And being so ridiculously late to the game, 1 or 2 T6-quality pieces is not going to catapult a Karazhan raider to the top performer in a T6-farming guild.<br />
<br />
Badges of Justice are rewards for tackling difficult instances -- and bear in mind that a heroic group is organized, screened and executed by a leader who has certainly put forth enough effort to deserve rewards that even a raid tag-along can get without an ounce of effort beyond signing up for a roster. What's more -- it's a way for me to keep my alts up to speed as viable swap-in replacement for my main if my guild needs me. I keep a DPS (Hunter-main) a healer (Priest) and a tank (Druid) geared up and ready to rock and I work hard to get both of my alts geared up, raiding T5 on my main, healing Kara clears on my priest and tanking heroics on my druid.<br />
<br />
IMO there are way too many one-dimensional arguments spewn out by single-minded whiners on these 2.4 posts.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">swirl_child</div><div class="date">2008-03-20, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well Ill put it to you like this...<br />
<br />
Even tho I wouldnt personally agree that T4 = S1, T5 = S2 etc... skins may match but it ends there imo (Maybe thats just the PvE'er in me talking :s)<br />
<br />
You want to show an achievement/have a sense of achievement?<br />
<br />
T4 = Kara and Gruul, most would agree that both are pretty much lolfests, Kara is pugged and Gruul takes 22+ so-so players willing to throw themselves at Gruul to down him, somewhere between easy and a notch above easy<br />
<br />
T5 = Some parts are pretty easy and some get tougher, but it does scale up and getting ur head and chest doesnt come so easy<br />
<br />
T6 = MH/BT (Havent personally been, but my understanding is some opening bosses are quite easy and they scale up a lot in difficulty), so again we can see the scale going up<br />
<br />
SW loot - Well, I dont think they are going to just hand that stuff out, do u? Only the higher guilds and skilled players will get it (at least any time soon)<br />
<br />
So now for PvP loot.... for shits, lets use our hands.... ready?<br />
<br />
S1/2, put your left hand as far down as you can - this is the skill needed to obtain these items...<br />
<br />
S4, put your right hand as far up as you can - this is the skill needed to obtain these items... (rated)<br />
<br />
ooops, did I forget S3? ok back track slightly, move your right hand ever-so-slightly down - this is the skill needed to obtain these items... (rated)<br />
<br />

<br />
Only the good PvE guilds get T6 stuff, so why should not only the good PvP people get the S3/4 stuff? To be quite honest, there is going to be (I HOPE!!) not much difference between S3 and S4. Otherwise S4 would be FAR superior to PvE equipment (bear in mind that Sunwell loots are very very very minimally better than temple loots). The only higher-level loots will probably come from Kil'jaeden himself. And that will take the BEST of the best guilds at least 1-2 months to get to.<br />
<br />
So my point is: Keep the freaking rating req on S3 (ok, lowering it by 50 is ok, but NOT more!) and make a req of 2000+ for EVERY SINGLE S4 item. Either that or: lower the points you get for Arenas by half, and don't allow to carry over ANY single arena point.<br />
<br />
This way, it is fair for both PvE and PvP.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the BoJ comments above: Everyone who starts off with 0 BoJ's should not have ANY right to whine at all, because this clearly is a freaking slacker that just wants shiny T6-instance equivalent loots for free. New BoJ loot was announced almost 1 month ago. That's at LEAST 4x21=84 badges already (Kara farm), give it another 1-2 weeks until 2.4 comes onto live then you'll have 126 badges. Combine it with some Zul/Heroic runs, and basically you could have your first badge loot already the minute the vendor spawns on live (well, minus the 30 minute travel to sunwell for ally chars :))<br />
<br />

<br />
OR somebody who has just spent all their badges on their Nth BoJ piece on their list, working hard to build a gear set that allows them to be viable in 25-man raids one or two tiers above their gear. And last I checked the cost of badge rewards was... badges, which are hardly free and do require effort and time to attain.<br />
<br />
Anyway my point was that raiding is still going to net you better rewards and faster, PvP is not a replacement for PvE raiding, and BoJ rewards are not FREE epics for slackers. To further refine the point: PvP and BoJ epics are NOT going to destroy end-game raiding.</div></div><hr />

S4 in the hands of good PvP players is much more deadly than S2 or S3 in the hands of a crappy AV AFKer.<br />

You can take your elitism and shove it. You'll still be able to successfully complete scripted encounters and recieve the corresponding loot. And yes, that loot will make you a special snowflake. But stop pissing in everyone else's cheerios.<br />
<br />
From an indivual perspective, raider # 23 in a high end raiding guild really doesn't do anything special other than show up on time to practice the polka. The only real challenge in 25 man raiding is getting 25 monkeys into the same cave at the same time for long enough to teach them the strat that the raid leader got off wowwiki. It is more of a social challenge than a gaming challenge. I've been in good raiding guilds, and bad raiding guilds, and the only real difference is the strength of the leadership. Unless you are the GM of a world first guild, your epeen flaunting, elitist attitude is pathetically meaningless.<br />
<br />
And there is nothing wrong with &quot;welfare&quot; epics. In no way do they prevent you from completing your 25 man polka successfully. Just like you getting your Sunwell loot doesn't really impact my ability to roflmelt you in arenas. What they do accomplish is the elimination of the lolepix dominance of raiders in PVP. Anyone who has been rolled by full T3 premades while wearing their rank 9 blues knows what I mean. So you play your game, and let others play theirs.</div></div><hr />

I am sure that chupavida is in an arena team that can easily beat the rating requirements and is not one of the &quot;I want all the good things for no effort now!&quot; guys.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I completely agree with you: You deserve the S4 items. But just to make sure that JoeSchmoe that every day afk's through AVs, and loses 10 games a week in the arena does not get equivalent gear as you, wouldn't YOU agree to put rating reqs on all S4 items?<br />

<br />
Only the good PvE guilds get T6 stuff, so why should not only the good PvP people get the S3/4 stuff? To be quite honest, there is going to be (I HOPE!!) not much difference between S3 and S4. Otherwise S4 would be FAR superior to PvE equipment (bear in mind that Sunwell loots are very very very minimally better than temple loots). The only higher-level loots will probably come from Kil'jaeden himself. And that will take the BEST of the best guilds at least 1-2 months to get to.<br />
<br />
So my point is: Keep the freaking rating req on S3 (ok, lowering it by 50 is ok, but NOT more!) and make a req of 2000+ for EVERY SINGLE S4 item. Either that or: lower the points you get for Arenas by half, and don't allow to carry over ANY single arena point.<br />
<br />
This way, it is fair for both PvE and PvP.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the BoJ comments above: Everyone who starts off with 0 BoJ's should not have ANY right to whine at all, because this clearly is a freaking slacker that just wants shiny T6-instance equivalent loots for free. New BoJ loot was announced almost 1 month ago. That's at LEAST 4x21=84 badges already (Kara farm), give it another 1-2 weeks until 2.4 comes onto live then you'll have 126 badges. Combine it with some Zul/Heroic runs, and basically you could have your first badge loot already the minute the vendor spawns on live (well, minus the 30 minute travel to sunwell for ally chars :))<br />

I love the fact you mention, &quot;Only the good PvE guilds get T6 stuff&quot; then go on to speak of badges, which are attainable in greens depending on the group to purchase t5-6 quality loot.........but no blizzard didn't make it incredibly easy for PvErs (yes sarcasm intended) to gear up for end game.........anyways I'm not trying to flame your post, I do agree with much of this.......but atm the gaps, be it pvp versus pve, or s3 vs s4, just don't measure up..........I suppose in time</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadlybonne</div><div class="date">2008-03-21, 12:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I managed to get 1950 rating 2v2, hitting 2k even with 50 points difference is pretty hard. 50 points make a big difference because if your rating goes up mostly depends on which teams u will face. I played dpriest rogue.<br />
<br />
The main problem with arena for me, is keeping people in their arenateams. I would advise to make a special system to reward players with an ubercool looking set with same stats as the current season that rewards pro player to stay in their current teams and battle for glory.<br />
<br />
Lets face it, as soon as &quot;pros&quot; got their weapons and shoulders, they leave their team , help friends, sell points ... Only the uberpros 2200+ stay in their team to compete for gladiator. There must be more incentive rewards so people dont own noobs in full arenagear. Make them loose something if they remake teams, like gaining special points for maintaining the same team each week at a certain rating. Points u can use to buy the same equipment but with ubercool graphics. This way people would stay in their teams not steamrolling lowbies or getting bored and remaking teams.<br />
<br />
Its also alot harder to gain your 1850 rating as an average skilled player once your 8 weeks into the current season, since people have their weapons and shoulders, u will meet fully geared teams smashing in your face, making your win ratio alot lower and thus harder to achieve 1850. Not only do people have to fight people from their own rating but also 2k+ teams or boosters which isnt fair.<br />
<br />
The main reason why i think ratings on s3 should be alot lower is for people who play special combos or class specs which arent as viable. I know a fully geared enhancement shaman which i try to help to get 1850 for his weapon. Its pretty hard to achieve this when u dont have the perfect setup. For all people really hard trying different combinatiosn to get their weapon or shoulders, this would be fair</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadlybonne</div><div class="date">2008-03-21, 12:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A big problem is skilled teammates. I been playing for 2 years, and was lucky to find a rogue that got me my weapon, he was really good, and was playing at the 1400 ratings 2v2. I tried him out for my 3v3 and we did fairly ok, then i saw his 1400 rating and asked him to do 2v2 together. We managed to get 1950 2v2 and then when he got his weapons he moved to another server with his friends which all have full gear weapons + shoulders. He got his shoulders on the new server and i can't find a decent replacement to get my shoulders.<br />
<br />
My server only has one 2k+ 5v5 team, 3 teams above 2k 3v3 and 3 2v2 above 2k. Im on skullcrusher eu cyclone bg. Saying it is easy to achieve 2k is a joke because there just arent many good teams to play on. Check your own server and how many teams actually have achieved 2k+ not so many. Might be different server to server.<br />
<br />
I want the ratings to be alot lower for these reasons. Some classspecs are not viable to achieve the ratings and so people who are failry good and tried to whole season to get the rating, need to be rewarded when they dont play any common combo of the current season.<br />
2 Teammates are hard to find and thus its quite unfair for alot of decent people to never be able to reach it<br />
<br />
I probably will never reach 2k this season and i have no problem that i wont have my shoulders. I also wouldnt mind not having them in s4. Offcourse it would be fun that the ratings would be around 1850-1900 for shoulders s3 which only the best combos will be able to get. Nobody that has a strong combo will ever get 1850 unless uberskilled people that can make anything work with alot of practice.<br />
<br />
there should be no rating on weapons so ele shammies, enhancement shammies, fire mage, bm hunter,and all other classes with specs that are hard to achieve high ratings,<br />
<br />
i know alot of these people are playing hard and trying out different people, even paying skilled ones. the game would be quite boring if people rerolled each season and only played the classes that pown them.<br />
<br />
I cant complain, i play a priest which is viable in all brackets quite nicely. But i guess the game would be less fun playing a gimped class or spec<br />
<br />
there needs to be a middleground found , so weapons and shoulders arent free, but at a rating so that gimped classes can also achieve them</div></div><hr />

there are some specs, that really suck in arena (*but Blizzard makes gear sets for them), I mean feral druids and enh. shamans etc. I hope Blizz will do smth to bring them up a bit, or they just should produce only resto items for hybrid classes, coz they have no other chance to survive in arena... The longer these specs have troubles to get 1700+, the longer the situation with AP-selling will exist...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deadlybonne</div><div class="date">2008-03-21, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a note, i also understand the need for skilled people to have a difference. They want people to notice a difference between good and worse players. I believe weapons and gear is not the way to achieve this. From their point of view, there is no reward in being skillfull if all people can just buy the same weapon and gear. Sure it sucks when everyone would have the best stuff like a 2k+ player has<br />
<br />
I believe they should make cool , funny, usefull rewards for skilled players.<br />
<br />
All good players want to have is being different ,<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to find a good way to reward these people without creating a geargap. The main reason why op people want high ratings so as few people as possible can wear it and thus creating more importance to their character.<br />
<br />
Reward skilled players with a better looking gearset and they wont have a problem with no ratings. <br />
<br />
This is the same way to fix pve complaints. All the complaints about welffare epics are about that people have the same gear and look the same. Raiders want to be special, look special.<br />
<br />
If top pvp players had a special looking set, and raiders would have a special set, there would be alot less complaints.<br />
<br />
Sure it sucks, raiding and spending alot of time when somebody wears the exact same set from pvp alot faster.<br />
<br />
The diversity in bc got lost, blizzard needs to make sure people dont all look the same... If they do, then people will try to make sure other people can't have the same stuff and then ratings requirements came along....<br />
<br />
Its very simple to fix this and i dont understand why its so hard to make differents sets, is it really so much work ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read about two pages into the topic and all I saw was &quot;QQ the ratings are way too high&quot; or &quot;How are we supposed to compete with teams that can get those high ratings&quot;?!<br />
<br />
Quit your moaning and bitching.<br />
<br />
You still have access to all the S3 &amp; S4 pieces except the weapon and shoulders, which entitles you to nearly the same gear that people that earn their arena armor and weapons (aka skilled players).<br />
<br />
The shoulders have the least amount of stat increase of any of the arena set pieces and are to distinguish teams that hold 1400 ratings and those that can hit 2k.<br />
<br />
Yes the weapons are a nice upgrade to the S2 weapons (more so for melee because of armor pen), but they are not a game breaking difference. Instead of investing your time in QQing, you could instead learn how to play your class properly, work on strats with your teammates, practice in duels, and farm to enchant your welfare epics, you'd all probably be competing near the 1800-1900 bracket quite easily.<br />
<br />
Just because you pay $15 a month and blizzard is trying to cater to the casual player doesn't entitle you to top tier pvp gear automatically. Oh and don't try to compare the heroic badge loot to tier 6 because all the items in Sunwell will eclipse what you can get from running H.mech everyday.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Occulte</div><div class="date">2008-03-23, 07:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry Billy (and others with the same mentality) but your comment is very shortsighted and misguided.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has all but destroyed the ranking system thanks to personal rating requirements. How? Simple, they have given a huge incentive for highly skilled arena players to slum around the lower ranks while running people to 1850 so they can get their weapons, for the low low price of 3500 gold. Don't forget the 8 separate teams those same gladiators run up to 2k every week so they can sell spots off to desperate players in need of points.<br />
<br />
What this has done is knocked the majority of your players down 100 to 200 points easily. So your teams that could hit 2k are now lucky to get 1800 much less 1850. Your 1850 teams will never hit the 1800 mark. When you queue up on a 1650 team and end up fighting 1 guy that should be at that level and then the number 1 2v2 team in your battlegroup, well then you have a serious problem.<br />
<br />
So no, pulling the &quot;blah blah those that deserve it get it&quot; card is complete and utter horsesh*t. First of all, 2200 and 2300 players should not be down in the 1900 and below ratings every day of the week, nor should many of their customers be anything over 1600. Have you ever walked around your server and seen guys holding season 3 weapons that have 1400 2s, 3s, and 5s teams? Do those guys deserve their weapons? Because they shelled out 3500 gold to get them? Please.<br />
<br />
The last thing Blizzard is doing is catering to the casual player. They are further rewarding people that put in a ton more time whether it be farming arena teams or farming gold to pay for the items in arena. Blizzard is attempting to fix the team selling stuff with their newest lack-of-thought completely retarded &quot;fix&quot; in the next patch. However, even that will have no effect on 4 2400 rated players running some guy shelling out cash to 1850 with their 5s team.<br />
<br />
I can certainly empathize with the people complaining about the lack of reduction in requirements for arena season 3 gear when season 4 hits. Especially considering they will get to fight guys with season 4 shoulders and weapons all the time now at the 1500 - 1600 range. ;-)<br />
<br />
This is further good news for gladiators though:<br />
<br />
Season 3 weapons and shoulders for 2.5k and 3.5k respectively.<br />
Season 4 weapons for 4k.<br />
Season 4 shoulders for 5k.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MdJ</div><div class="date">2008-03-23, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Occulte, it sounds to me like you faced some full s3 team at lower ratings, got killed, and are now QQ'ing about it. <br />
Yes, there are some people selling points and personal rating, no, it's not a floodgate of 2400 rated players killing poor noobs. Billy's points mostly stand. If you are skilled enough for 2k, you will reach 2k, if you are not, you will not reach 2k and instead go whine about it on forums. Even if your comment weren't grossly exaggerated, I still wouldn't see the problem with it. Shoulders are a status symbol, you're not supposed to get them unless you are skilled. <br />
Moreover, all these people in full s3 that are supposedly walking around at 1500 rating: it won't take them more than a couple of hours to get 1800+, so I doubt you'll be facing them for very long. <br />
<br />
The last point that annoys me is that the lack of a weapon and shoulders is a disadvantage for lower rated players, and that's why they can't get to the higher ratings. This is, of course, purely ridiculous. The difference between S2 and S3/S4 weapon and shoulders won't suddenly make you a terrible player or a very good one. Stop blaming other people for your lack of skills or dedication: if you want 2k, practice your ass off, find some good teammates, and repeat until succes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SageOTG</div><div class="date">2008-03-23, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really, the rating requirements shouldn't change so drastically. Whether or not 50 points difference is acceptable, I can't really say. With the way arena has been for the past half of the season, I'm leaning towards agreement with the new ratings. Maybe decrease it by another 50, but I'd say no more than that.<br />
<br />
If you play a warlock in high-end arena brackets (as I do), or probably even low-end, you know that melee stomps a hole in warlocks. Giving all rogues access to S3 weapons right off the bat of S4 is a definite no-no. The top end and armor penetration is very substantial in comparison to S1 and even S2 I would say (I have a rogue too now, imagine that). Does it make you a better player by wielding better weapons? Of course not. But when you are good enough to lock down a warlock (which honestly isn't very hard) the extra damage adds up significantly - especially if your teammate has half of a braincell. Imo, Blizz can remove the weapon requirements when they fix/remove Cheat Death. That's not even touching on Warriors, but honestly I think they are a far more balanced class regardless of their power. The rest of the melee classes, I imagine, see less benefit than a rogue...particularly because of how easy it is to deal damage with a rogue. Don't get me wrong, they are a very complicated class to play well...but let's be realistic: power should have limits when your source of damage output comes in the form of infinite energy and auto-attack. Yes, rogues are just one of the classes, but those thoughts alone are enough to make me agree with the costs.<br />
<br />
As for casters...who really cares. 20 more spell damage for us, woohoo. Weapons only excite casters for the recognition they bring :( Give us more! :P<br />
<br />
It might look like I'm doing some QQing...but in reality, S3 weapons are too overpowered to be handed out to every player with arena points. It's like putting a bazooka in the hands of a child. Too much power for such naive hands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love how you make a comment in your post about how outlandish my points are, and then make a generalized and typical statement to start your rant.<br />
<br />
I got my S3 weapons 3 weeks after S3 started. I got my shoulders about 3 weeks after that when my mage and I found a decent priest to play with. So no, believe it or not there is nothing in my post with regards of what I can or cannot do. It's for the other people that have made countless comments to me about this. To be so naive as to say there is no difference between S1 and S2 when compared to S3 is pretty sad. 2k RATED PLAYERS (myself included) HAVE NO BUSINESS PLAYING DAY IN AND DAY OUT IN THE 1500 - 1800 RANGE! I'm sorry to come off like such a martyr here, but it is ruining the arena for many players.<br />
<br />
To think that Blizzard put in this PR rule to benefit &quot;skilled&quot; PvP players is absolutely laughable. They did it to stem the massive flow of whining and PvE tears of our fabulous raiding brethren. And before we get into yet another PvP vs PvE war, I didn't totally disagree with the PvE whiners. However, this idea failed miserably. There are people that would never hit 1850 without the help of a gladiator (and lots of gold) that have weapons, and there are people that are good enough to hit 1850 that will never see it without the help of others. THAT is not a fix, that is yet another broken thing Blizzard has handed us. I don't mean to speak for the entire server-base of the game, but this is certainly what we are seeing in our battlegroup.<br />
<br />
To Scorched: I was generalizing the cost, not going off of something I know to be fact.</div></div><hr />
