You might recall that Blizzard &quot;reset&quot; the Titan project back in mid 2013 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3262-Titan-project-reset-delayed-until-2016). Mike Morhaime confirmed to Polygon (http://www.polygon.com/2014/9/23/6833953/blizzard-cancels-titan-next-gen-mmo-pc) today that the project is now cancelled.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team set out to make another amazing MMO after World of Warcraft, but they didn't find the fun or passion.<br />
Metzen said the decision to cancel Titan was excruciating, but cancelling projects has always resulted in better quality work.<br />
Right now Blizzard doesn't want to spend time working on another MMO.<br />
Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm helped Blizzard realize they don't have to work on giant projects.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, it doesn't mean that the development team is no longer working on something. Multiple sources who seem to point towards a new unannounced project from Blizzard that would be codenamed Prometheus and could be another project built around a new license for Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this last bit is very much unofficial and unconfirmed.</div></div><hr />

Say what you will about the current state of WoW, or any of Blizzard's games, but Blizzard knows what they're doing.

WoW is almost 10 years old, I really wanted to see what they could do with something more modern.</div></div><hr />

Sadly this seems to suggest they're finding fun and passion with WoW in its current incarnation; something I certainly haven't felt since WOTLK. Sad news in any case; all i've ever wanted was a WoW-esque sci-fi MMO. The only options, such as SW:TOR, have been train wrecks.</div></div><hr />

I don't want WoW to die, but at the same time I really want a new MMORPG from Blizzard, they make very good games and have always been the go-to-company for me when it comes to games. <br />

<br />
They won't. Releasing details will only increase fan disappointment and is a bad move business wise. Everyone looks to blizzard as the go-to example of how to make an MMO and letting their competitors in on whatever trade secrets they had in the works on a next-gen MMO would be bad for business. <br />
<br />
If blizzard comes out and says &quot;here is what our next-gen mmo was going to be&quot; nothing would stop a competitor from stealing those ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that games are much harder to develop and take a lot more time to put together, I would say 7 years is about right. Think about how long Half life 3 has been in development. Think about how much Destiny cost. Games are getting so big that its hard to see them not taking more time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you define &quot;a major title&quot;? By all accounts, Hearthstone is a huge success and making a lot of money. Heroes is poised to be the same. Blizzard is still a behemoth in the PC gaming space and I'd argue that any release by them is a major one.</div></div><hr />

Or...<br />

Maybe they see the coming demise of the subscription MMO market.<br />
<br />
Or....<br />
<br />
They really did scrap it because it was just crap. Which, if true, is a big kudos to them. Most gaming companies would release it anyways to make some money to recover their losses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't know what to say about Heroes of the Storm since I haven't played it at all, but Hearthstone has been an overall let down for me. I may have put a few dollars into it in hopes of more fun gameplay, but then I realized for immediate fun a lot of dollars would have to be sunk in. Then Naxx was released, another money sink for more fun gameplay and I called it quits. I am not against a system the requires money to play since I do play WoW but I felt that what Hearthstone had to offer was much too shallow for my liking.<br />
<br />
I really hope blizz doesn't come out with tons of small games like this. So far, I am not a fan. Titan was hope for something big and new - a WoW2, if you will, and I am very much craving that same sense of wonder I had all those years ago when I logged into the World of Warcraft for the first time.</div></div><hr />

Bungie wanted to make a sci-fi mmo but didn't have any experience in doing so.<br />
Blizzard has experience making an MMO.<br />
Blizzard wanted to make a sci-fi mmo that was casual friendly and a new IP.<br />
A lot of resources were dumped into Titan at the expense of every other project Blizzard was working on, a bad move for them, but a good move if it was for the greater good of ActivisionBlizzard.<br />
Titan had resources pulled from it a handful of months before the bigger alpha and beta testing was going on for Destiny.<br />
Destiny is strongly reminiscent of vanilla D3 when it first launched. An expectation to grind the exact same things over and over again with very RNG loot the only carrot on the stick to motivate players to keep playing.<br />
Seeing that Titan has been completely 'scrapped' shortly after Destiny launches only makes the suspicions all the stronger. I'm hoping that it means that Blizzard quality products come out of Blizzard again.</div></div><hr />

Nah the early artwork of titan we saw really really look like it is what destiny is now pretty sure they shared it to bungie and handed them over the stuff. Rumor of it being a mmofps in voordination with bungie. Destiny is Titan I have no doubt no matter what they say. All the thing about titan being futuristic earth with real world location, mmo fps rumor mill. Yup. No. Doubt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That does make some theoretical sense considering Activision apparently made a deal with Bungie to develop a game nearly 7 or so years ago, rumours of Titan suggested it was a loot shooter, members from the Titan team moved back to the WoW team not long before Destiny was announced along with it's release date. Then again they could have just had a team umming and ahing over a WoW clone for seven years whilst trying to figure out how to make it gun centric and appear different.<br />

<br />
That's the thing that puzzles me about WoW - they hire top artists and coders. Their dungeon design is first rate. And yet they hire some random guys off the street to design the classes. <br />

From playing on WoD beta, the expansion content is beautiful and first-rate, but they have flat out ruined the fun of a large number of specs.</div></div><hr />

You are not very good at tinfoil hat conspiracy.. Titan &quot;was cancelled&quot; after Destiny launched. The point is that Titan never existed, it was Destiny all this time. So since Destiny launched, and since they probably cant say that Titan was in fact Destiny (activision probably dont want), they just come out and say they &quot;cancel&quot; Titan and its over, they dont have to show/prove anything.<br />

If you read the history of Bungie and their divorce from Microsoft you'd also see that Bungie has no interest in outside interference. They are a development studio though and need a publisher such as Activision to distribute/market their games. They had been working on this new IP in 2007. <br />

There are already several people who report to have played the WoD beta on a xbox controller pretty comfortably on multiple classes. The only thing that seems to be annoying to manage with a gamepad are bags.<br />
Some are even planning to level to 100 using a gamepad, just for fun.<br />
<br />
The ability pruning seems to have made that easier by a huge amount since blizzard also cut many core dps abilities, especially on classes that had more complex rotations.</div></div><hr />

I agree with your sentiment, I read the not having fun is that every iteration of Titan they produced was just a WoW clone, there is only so much room to innovate with in the MMO Market that no matter what direction they took Titan it was either WoW 2.0 or was too close in concept to other Sci-Fi titles.</div></div><hr />

There's a major problem with your theory:<br />
<br />
Titan was cancelled. Destiny launched already. If it was cancelled, how is it that it managed to launch?<br />
<br />
<br />
ie. Titan WAS Destiny. Destiny is made by a Bungie, but distributed solely by ActiBlizz. Not a massive brain leap to put 2-and-2 together is it? &quot;Titan&quot; gets developed, Blizz + Bungie. Bungie finished it off (With the staff returning to WoW - see 50% staff increase posts previously) Destiny launches.....Titan gets cancelled.....it's not THAT hard really is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Money? Or to break it down, Bungie wanted to make an FPS MMO, but didn't know how to get the MMO bit right (As someone pointed out earlier in this thread) so pay ActiBlizz an ass-ton of money for their expertise. They get to release the /sarcasm-on &quot;biggest console game ever!!!&quot; /sarcasm-off, and ActiBlizz gets to distribute it.<br />
<br />
As for the PC release, Destiny was &quot;meant&quot; to come to PC....whether it will or not, is probably down to how much money it makes now.<br />

Because your average Joe doesn't care about graphics or custom rigs. All they've ever played is consoles and most likely don't educate themselves on capabilities of computers. They just want to play a game.

How is WoW supposed to work on a gamepad? This isn't Diablo 3 with a total of 4 abilities and a 2d perspective. How would you target enemies or cast aoe spells without being 10x as slow as PC players?<br />
<br />
I can't even imagine how much the whole UI and gameplay would have to be watered down and modified to be managable on a gamepad.<br />
<br />
The same way FF XIV did, the ability pruning in WOD is only making it easier for them to push to consoles. Some classes only have 3-4 buttons in WoD, cooldowns can easily be used with control pad modifiers (like hold R2 and press X button) for example giving them even more buttons potentially.<br />
<br />
They'd have to give console players their own servers however because I can't see intermediate guilds recruiting control pad players let alone hardcore high end guilds, it would divide them from pc users and I doubt they'd want console players feeling left out like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They lost the passion for making new franchises a while ago. In fact the last game from the current franchises to have a new plot would be diablo II. Warcraft 3 plot resembles a LOT the starcraft story (lich king, zerg overmind, Arthas, kerrigan and so on). Ah, and starcraft II, from what I saw they were following the burning legion idea, a powerful new force to wipe out the galaxy. Won't even comment the &quot;story&quot; of diablo 3.<br />
<br />
Also I am still MAD they canceled starcraft: Ghost. Yes, I realize that was some years ago but it still upsets me. It was not the first and wont be the last they cancel anyways (and we just saw it again). I wouldnt mind paying to play the game in the incomplete stage.</div></div><hr />

I'm not surprised. They just won't repeat the magic and it's better to focus their resources on WoW. <br />
<br />
This!<br />
<br />
Initial WoW sales benefitted more from timing than quality. In today's market, if they were to release a subscription MMO of any significant success (let's call it 4+ million subs), the majority of those subs would be coming from their own base. That's not a sustainable business model unless they killed WoW (hush, trolls) and they know they would not retain a high enough percentage of subs if they did that.<br />
<br />
They are honestly doing the right thing with Hearthstone and HoTS, creating spinoff titles using their existing IP until they identify the next big incoming wave and make their move to jump on it ahead of the crowd.</div></div><hr />

Ghost was scrapped, but we ended up with some inspirational material that has led to NOVA being a Blizzard Hero and the most likely Ghost hero if Blizzard ever added SC heroes to Hearthstone. Obviously she plays a decent role in SC2.<br />
<br />
Titan may lead to advanced features into WoW. It also may form the basis of the next generation WoW engine. I do believe that WoD was done as a tie in to the upcoming WoW movie (so that we understand who the villains are/where) since that will allow them to focus on hero development from the first war. Which means that WoD is somewhat of a diversion and sandbox for Blizzard. The next expansion could truly be epic, and I think that they are starting to slowly bring more meaningful story to the game as well.<br />
<br />
One interesting item will be if Ogres and Arroakoa become new races in the next expansion from the AU. It would slowly integrate them into the story and make sense, rather than just have them &quot;appear&quot; after a short intro. More focus on the &quot;EPIC&quot; nature. I am rambling...sorry.</div></div><hr />

I'd say not far considering they scrapped the original idea less than a year ago to go back to the drawing boards. <br />
<br />
All in all, no shock here. I figured from the start that it would never become reality when there was talk of it being an MMO. <br />

I hope that this is good for WoW though. Instead of focusing on the next MMO they're looking to release, they can actually put some effort back into WoW so this game becomes as quality as it was all the way through WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Except Activision is not Blizzard so your argument immediately breaks down. They are separate entities.

They have been promising that for 4 years and each cycle has only gotten longer. This will change nothing about WoW or SCII or D3. It only means that more cheap FTP with giant cash store games with little depth and next to no story are going to be the norm for Blizzard from here on out.<br />
<br />
Oh and I echo that I wouldnt be the least bit surprised if WoW is announced for Consoles this Blizzcon. Every other MMO is doing it now.. D3 is on consoles. Why wouldnt blizzard do the same to wow? Its more money for old content and just take a look at ptr and beta if you think wow is too complicated to be on console. Not fucking now it isnt.<br />
<br />
And keep an eye out for news within the next few weeks about massive layoffs from Blizzard. They are going to axe a huge amount of people, instead of put them on WoW or any other project. Gotta save them pennies.</div></div><hr />

As for the PC release, Destiny was &quot;meant&quot; to come to PC....whether it will or not, is probably down to how much money it makes now.<br />

And again, I did say it wasn't that big a leap to think it, not saying it's the truth<br />

Bungie was unable to make a MMO while being owned by Microsoft. They wanted creative control and the only way to do that was to cut ties. That happened in 2007.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately no, I means smaller and smaller PopCap style games like Hearthstone. WoW2 could literally wind up being something you play on your smart phone and here's the problem - it will have no soul. There will be no addons*, no way to put your own custom sounds, etc. It'll probably be F2P with Microtransactions. <br />
<br />
* Whether you like addons or not, it says a lot for the quality of the game that addons are a thing that you can create.<br />

I'm not sure what you're on but DOTA 2 and LoL were never based on a Blizzard game. They were based on a game mode made by players on the WC3 map editor and engine using WC3 art assets before then being made standalone by the same players. Then one of the original members of the team brought the name and game to Valve who made DOTA 2 and finally Blizzard released their game based on the same format of LoL and DOTA 2.</div></div><hr />

It has always felt like some obligation, &quot;Blizz must release a next gen MMO or they'll be swept away by Conan/LOTRO/FFXIV/Wildstorm/ect&quot;, when they're quite happy working WoW and developing projects they like, Hearthstone for instance. After 10 years, the players are still here. A lot of them won't be going anywhere. Unless they get an idea that truly hits them like Hearthstone did, I don't know if there's a need for it.<br />
<br />
I do hope some of the expertise they gained via the project might go toward a reworked WoW engine. I'd be nice to not have a new game, but a complete work of the engine to modern specs and tech, using our characters. Everything Cata should have been.</div></div><hr />

WoW changed something about blizzard.. they no longer make games for their players.. but do as they want how they want and damned the consequences regardless of how thier players respond a 50+% drop and nothing in the future shows anything changing soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Broadband connections appeared around 1999, online games flurished from then and onwards. I was 26 back then, now i am 41. So what, will I still play wow for another 10 years? I would like to see a new MMO from Blizzard, before i &quot;retire&quot; from semi-hardcore and hardcore mmo-rpg gaming. This is an important matter, people who were 13 or 20 when wow appeared now are 20 30 or 40 like me. I would be really interested to see some statistics on this. As we get older the game gets older, our habbits and needs are different from a game, i will admit that Blackfuse 25heroic was the first time i felt despair in wow (Well until i master the belt :P ). What is Blizzard going to do about it? Will WoW die of old age? or just rise from it's ashes as a phoenix? I think , now that Titan is out, will be the later.<br />
<br />
I remember some posts some years ago, about Titan and many users said that Blizzard can't release another MMO until WoW dies. However it is 2014 and WoW is up and kicking hard, where new mmo-rpg challengers obviously failed. <br />
If Titan was indeed &quot;sold&quot; or &quot;given&quot; to another company to make Destiny, i can't be sure. After all what would be the point of Bungie releasing it as their own? On the other hand perhaps when blizzard bought themselves back from activision, Titan -&gt; Destiny was in the deal? And they hid it by saying they are scrambling it but instead they ported it to Bungie or worked for bungie? who knows.<br />
<br />
All in all, it seems WoW has more years of fun and Titan was the victim. I am ok with it, however i will think twice not to play and focus on Star Citizen for example!</div></div><hr />

They would be better off reinvesting into a new WoW 2.0 where we can migrate our characters and all the things we have accumulated over the years into a new engine.</div></div><hr />

pc gaming has so much more potential than crappy moba games, but people like league, farmville, and other crap for some reason.<br />
<br />
popular != good, that's like saying miley cyrus and taylor swift are the best musicians because they sell records...or apple products are the best cause they cost the most.<br />

the main problem is pc gaming is catering to the lowest common denominator. and stuff that requires any thought (like a rts game) is ignored in favor of casual games. so all we're going to see going forward is league (casualized dota) and hearthstone (casualized magic: the gathering) and so on.</div></div><hr />

However, i have been hardcore wow sub for many years and although i havent cancelled, i havent logged in since July. The $15 hasnt been a big deal. But Blizz you're right on the fringes of losing me, so i sure hope wod doesnt disappoint. There are quite a few other fun games around right now that have been taking my playtime.</div></div><hr />

popular != good, that's like saying miley cyrus and taylor swift are the best musicians because they sell records...or apple products are the best cause they cost the most.<br />

Bullshit. No it's not. Consoles can never compete with the graphics, customization, and game-to-game sales of PC games to consoles. Saying otherwise is spreading entirely false and biased information. Just wanted to clarify this for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats something I always wanted them (or some fan base) to make. Huge scale battles, things we could not do in warcraft I and II back then. The battles from the first two games were suposed to be huge armies facing each other but due to limitations they could not do that in the time. Was even hoping they would use some world of warcraft sets for the classes (for example the paladin tier 2 for the paladin unit, perhaps changing the set and aperance of the unit when you upgraded it, like changing sets).<br />
<br />
Still if I that happened I would bet it would be done by fans instead of blizzard, dont think they have the interest of doing it.</div></div><hr />

Another MMO even of a different genre would have an over lapping customer base. WoWs widely popular success was also a surprise for the developers and not something they thought they could replicate or so said by the developers many years back. You then having a general decline in the MMO playerbase and lack of success which makes market outlook seem bleak. Then comes the question can Blizzard really do a FPS game or do the higher ups even like FPS games. Ghost got canceled. Then there is also potential overlap with Destiny which because it isnt an MMO is quite accessible even if it can be quite hard. <br />
<br />
Even if the game was looking good it might not have had that hit feeling the developers needed to overcome many discouraging risk factors in todays market.</div></div><hr />

It's been a strange year.<br />
<br />
- Pardo gone<br />
- Ghostcrawler gone<br />
- Mumper has the most badges in untapp'd - IN THE WORLD*<br />
- No patches for Wow<br />
- Numbers diving<br />
- A very strange blizzcon. WOD presentation very off-key.<br />
- Movie coming.<br />
- Titan cancelled.<br />
- WOD beta feels a bit.. lacking?<br />
<br />
Something big is up. For me, Blizzard's rudder has drastically changed direction lately.<br />
<br />
Titan cancellation is very good news for us as huge Wow fans. As others have said, you can't make another mmo as successful as Wow. You just can't. The only, ONLY thing project in the world that could kill they have said for ten years now, is Wow itself. But I think it's not Wow that will kill itself, it's Wow2. Today's news is further confirmation of that. For years on here, I said Titan will be Wow2. Believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that Destiny had something to do with it. Either it was a part of the same project, converted over to Bungie, or simply Activision realized its top developers were working on similar projects and just wanted to go all out on Destiny, taking a lot of energy (and maybe resources) out of the Blizzard project.<br />
<br />
Regardless, it's not like they aren't going to come out with another game ever. I just was really interested in what genre this new IP would be in, considering they already have sci-fi (SC), fantasy/steampunk (Warcraft) and post-apocalyptic/apocalyptic-horror (Diablo).</div></div><hr />

I mean, Ghost was essentially a completed project and they scrapped it because it didn't measure up to their expectations. I think Blizzard is a better company for it.<br />
Meanwhile they have a history of releasing shit services in game. Blizzard has rushed things and released unfinished things. Blizzards philosophy might be to hold themselves to a higher quality, but they do not always especially now when they have such a loyal fan base name. To measure of to ones expectations is a vague hidden slider only known by those in charge.<br />
<br />
But hey even EA has canceled projects that didnt meet their standards. We wont know if Ghost just fell short of expectations, bad market timing, or if the developers made a shitty game unless someone comes out with more clarity on the subject. Saying something didnt met standards or expectations is just a vague PR cover. Sure if something you know isnt going to do well for what ever case that has you cancel it before it even hits selves then obviously it didnt meet expectations, but there can be so many factors behind that choice other than the game was blah.</div></div><hr />

Sad news in any case; all i've ever wanted was a WoW-esque sci-fi MMO. The only options, such as SW:TOR, have been train wrecks.<br />
<br />
If you considered WotLK the &quot;fun&quot; part of WoW and nothing since suggests to me that you're a wrath baby who didn't truly experience the content before when it was relevant and cancelled your sub before MoP; which was enjoyable and fun with all the story and lore we were exposed to.<br />
<br />
I can't wait for WoD, already pre-ordered my collector's edition. It will be the best expansion to date. Good to hear there will be more resources now for future patches and expansions; even if the death of a potentially good new game had to occur. I'd rather buy expansions for a game i enjoy and have invested in, than for a new game and all its future expansions that i have no info on or haven't played. GG Blizz, you finally did something right.<br />
<br />
Now stop nerfing hunter cards in hearthstone and steer away from a pay to win, back to the free to play game it was supposed to be; before you lose people and that game dies as well.<br />

<br />
- Bungie developed destiny, Activicion is the publisher. Titan was developed by blizzard, but they didnt find the passion for it and scrapped the project. I assume its how they feel about making warcraft, passionate.<br />
<br />
- Blizzard also feels they dont need to developed large games, thanks to the experience with heroes of the storm and hearthstone, this dosent mean they will make mobile apps and free to play games nedxt to wow, thats reading into something that isnt there.<br />
<br />
- Not the first time, blizzard scrapped Starcraft ghost a fiew years back. Look at it this way, Tolkien started over when he didnt feel the story of LOTR was satisfying instead of editing it, could be similar phlosophy in the developement at blizzard. Im not saying it is tho.....<br />
<br />
- The team developing wow was recently expanded as evident in recent interviews, obvious where they put their money. Wow, HotS and Hearthstone have different developement teams.<br />
<br />
. Project prometheus may start a new and exciting blizzard series next to the three excisting universes, tho nothing is confirmed yet. Blizzcon soon.<br />
<br />
- Wod suffered for the early announcement, and i think the project got bigger then they anticipated - or we as player base are more demanding. Anyhow, the current tier has only been reinforced with fixes in 1 patch and added an extra arena season. It certainly shows that they had less time then intended. But we know blizzard delivers, and they wouldnt make all these descissions without considering the quality of the product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PR speak for the market has dwindled too much to risk the investment and development costs of an MMO.<br />
<br />
Especially when they can make more money with f2p games, which is what they are doing and will continue to do, so get used to it if you don't like f2p.<br />

Edit: Destiny likely beat them anyway, another reason, they took too long, beat out by several other studios, with some flops.</div></div><hr />
