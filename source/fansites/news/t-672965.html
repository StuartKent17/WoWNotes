Non Battle.net Accounts offline on November 12th<br />
Apparently, if you didn't merge your WoW account to a Battle.net account you won't be able to play the game after November 12th. The good news is, you get a free penguin! <br />
Q: What happens if I don’t merge my World of Warcraft account with a Battle.net account?<br />
A: After November 12, 2009, you won’t be able to log in to the game unless you merge your account with a Battle.net account. You will need to log in using your Battle.net account username (your email address) and password.<br />
<br />
Q: How can I obtain the penguin pet?<br />
A: Once you’ve successfully merged a World of Warcraft account with a Battle.net account, the penguin pet will be sent via in-game mail to all existing characters on the merged World of Warcraft account, along with all future characters on that World of Warcraft account. Players who merged previously will also receive the pet this way.<br />
<br />
Q: Do I need to merge by a certain date in order to receive the penguin?<br />
A: We plan to remove the ability to get the penguin pet at some point in the future, we haven’t determined exactly when just yet.<br />
<br />
Q: If I create a new World of Warcraft account, will I receive the pet?<br />
A: Only existing World of Warcraft accounts that merge with a Battle.net account are eligible to receive the penguin pet. If you create a new Battle.net account after November 11 and merge an existing World of Warcraft account with it you will still be able to receive the pet. However, please note that we plan to remove the ability to get the penguin pet at some point in the future.<br />
<br />
The penguin will most likely be Oswald (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55068/oswald/) (also known as Mr. Chilly, he was renamed in the latest PTR build of Patch 3.3 but Oswald is a nice name (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_%28comics%29) too), Mr. Chilly was the pet given to US beta testers who converted their account to Battle.net when the feature was on WotLK beta servers. Please note that Pengu (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44723/nurtured-penguin-egg/) was also changed in Patch 3.3 and doesn't have his scary red eyes anymore. <br />

You agreed to switch to single Battle.net account at any time Blizzard chooses to tell you so each time after the patch, when you click &quot;accept&quot; on the terms of service. They don't need any more reasoning for demanding it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Potentially anyone can have any pet (without restrictions of discontinuation), pets don't even affect the game at all outside of being able to make gold off of em. QQ more, keep using your other pets if you want to be a unique snowflake.<br />
<br />
Oh and also @Blizz: ZOMG ITS A CONSPIRACY!!!11!11111!!! Oh wait, my account's already merged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The pet is a &quot;thanks for listening and merging on time&quot;. For those people who for some reason wait until a month after the deadline to merge, they will not likely be able to get the pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: If I create a new World of Warcraft account, will I receive the pet?<br />
A: Only existing World of Warcraft accounts that merge with a Battle.net account are eligible to receive the penguin pet. If you create a new Battle.net account after November 11 and merge an existing World of Warcraft account with it, you will still be able to receive the pet. However, please note that we plan to remove the ability to get the penguin pet at some point in the future.</div></div><hr />

Isn't it obvious? They want everyone to transfer to battle.net already so they can finally decommission those old login servers that keep dying all the time. Also money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Becuse battle.net is theire new gaming platform (community so to say) where you will have all friends and can chat with them whatever Blizzard game they are currently playing etc, and only idiots would not want to merge. So Blizzard are giving them a hand the hard way.</div></div><hr />

You're not paying anymore than you're already paying for your subscription. From what I've seen, Battle.net will be an incredible tool, it's a community tool. It will link all Blizzard games simultaneously, allowing you to actually chat with others on Battle.net, even if you're playing Starcraft II in the middle of a scrim match and your friend is raiding Blackwing Descent with their guild. It's going to be truly awesome. It's like Steam for Blizzard without the stupid program. Think of your Battle.net account as a skeleton key to all your games, instead of three to four logins, you have one master login that's linked to all your Blizzard games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-At blizzcon they said they wanted to do a revamp to the LFG interface by allowing the feature to look in the battlegroup<br />
-A few weeks/months ago a feature was show about the new battle.net stuff ( cross-realm friendlist)<br />
-Now they said it will have to be done BEFORE 12 November( a thursday), EXACTLY a year After they released WoTlk.<br />
<br />
Imho, does this mean 3.3 will be released on 11 November together with the new battle.net features?<br />
<br />
The 3.3 release sounds logical since its been a year we set foot in Northrend.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tural</div><div class="date">2009-10-10, 08:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why exactly are they doing this?Keep your friends list between games, be able to chat between games, only need one login between games, ability to track statistics and achievements between games, ability to do things like with the Battle Bot/Grunty/Oswald pets and how they are mailed to each character you create because Battle.net is a more improved platform with newer technology, removing the necessity to run two login systems on their side, removing the problems created by having two login systems, so their resources can go into making one stable/improved system with this multitude of new concepts.<br />
<br />
So yeah, maybe because it allows for a lot more features and provides a more stable infrastructure for their games to rely on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guys, during the signup it asks me for my address details and everything - can I just lie about them?Not advisable, as if you ever need to contact Blizzard, you're going to be SOL with fake information. There's no detriment to filling out your real info, it's not like Blizzard's going to sell your info or come rob you or something. Why wouldn't you provide your real details?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dart Matsuraki</div><div class="date">2009-10-10, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's get some facts out there for reasons to switch to battle.net.<br />
<br />
1) This is probably the most important reason. When you create a Battle.net account, and merge a WoW account to it, that WoW account's info gets sumperimposed by the Battle.net account's info. Now you're saying, &quot;So what?&quot;. Well, if you get hacked without a merged WoW account, chances are the hacker will merge your wow account to a battle.net account that he created and all of a sudden *POOF* your WoW account's info is gone and it'll take you a lot longer to convince them that that WoW account was yours.<br />
<br />
2) When Cataclysm launches (or even earlier) all friends list/ignore list/socializing functions within Blizzard's three franchises (Diablo 3, Starcraft 2, and World of Warcraft) will use battle.net. Your in-game friends lists will be shared between those 3 games, and without a battle.net account, theoretically, you wouldn't have access to your friends lists, etc. <br />
<br />
3) Log-in servers. This isn't being lazy on Blizzard's part, but any smart company will realize that funding two different sets of log-in servers when you can just consolidate it all in one cluster (which at this point is most likely more advanced than the older servers) is a positive change.<br />
<br />
4) Streamlining. This one is simple to explain. Accessing 3 franchises, the blizzard store, and each of the 3 games websites by having to remember only one set of Log-in credentials.<br />
<br />
5) And last but not least, TO GET CHILLY BACK! The little guy was always following me around during the beta. Glad to see him back into the game, even if his name is now Oswald.</div></div><hr />

Your in-game chats are logged even if you're not merged. This is something you agree to every time you click &quot;I Agree&quot; when you patch up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Does this apply to EU players?<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is the pet in game yet for existing merged people?<br />
<br />
No. They haven't given the pet out yet, they will likely do so early next month, just after the deadline.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do i need to create a new account on battlenet or where to merge my wow account and battle.net<br />
<br />
EU: https://eu.battle.net/account/creation/tos.xml<br />

You have an option to merge on your battle.net account management page, once you have made the account.<br />
<br />

They already do. That's how they check to see if someone really was spamming when someone gets reported.<br />
<br />
They can access backlogs of any kind of chat in the game. That doesn't mean they're watching everything you type to learn your dirty little secrets, but if they have a reason to investigate your account for any sort of infractions, they can look at all of your chat.</div></div><hr />

No, not really. The manpower that would be required for Blizzard to actively monitor chats in game would be ENORMOUS. This is in place so that if, say, RandomJerk whispers you and begins threatening you, you can report it and Blizzard can look up the log to confirm your story, then take action against RandomJerk. <br />
<br />
POTENTIALLY, they could set something up to keep an eye out for specific words and phrases and notify them if they're found, but given the nature of the game, such a system could be quite a hassle, either giving false-positives over innocuous statements or not encompassing enough to be worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

IP geolocation is very unreliable. You get an option to change the country on the first step of the sign up process, so it shouldn't really be an issue if you sign up using the wrong URL (Though I may be wrong, not tested ;D)</div></div><hr />

So cancel your account and leave instead of having to hold shift and press a key. Shun the new features and benefits of upgrading because you're concerned that you're going to do something irresponsible with your account.<br />
<br />
Getting hacked:<br />
Phishing: Doesn't matter if it's your email or WoW Account, they have either one and can log in to your account.<br />
Keylogging: Doesn't matter if it's your email or WoW Account, they have either one and can log in to your account.<br />
Guessing: Use a more secure password.<br />
Brute forcing: Use a more secure password, the time and resources that would go into this would never be made up for in the stuff they'd get from your account, which is why you shouldn't even be worrying about this if you're not being irresponsible with your security already, which would then negate your claim that it's a security risk since you're already putting yourself at risk on your own accord.<br />
<br />
So please enlighten us about this massive security risk that's not dependent on the user being irresponsible.</div></div><hr />

Convenience factor: Check the &quot;remember my username&quot; box.<br />
Security factor: Someone simply knowing your email cannot do any harm. The worst case scenario is that they start sending you some phishing emails. You could, however, always use an alternate email or a subaddress (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_address#Sub-addressing), making it youremail+battlenetyay@example.org if you're extremely worried about people knowing the exact email you use.<br />

Yes, that's in the first post and has been answered a half dozen times in the thread.<br />
<br />
Q: How can I obtain the penguin pet?<br />
A: Once you’ve successfully merged a World of Warcraft account with a Battle.net account, the penguin pet will be sent via in-game mail to all existing characters on the merged World of Warcraft account, along with all future characters on that World of Warcraft account. Players who merged previously will also receive the pet this way.</div></div><hr />

Yes. The pet is basically a &quot;Thanks for merging when we asked you to!&quot; The only people who won't get the pet are those who wait and do it long after the old accounts are cut off.</div></div><hr />

Then you are stupid. I haven't had a single problem before or after I merged my account to Battle.net already several months ago. Well enjoy your unability to log in game :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
95% of statistics used on forums are made up by their authors, myself included.<br />
<br />
That pet name is just awesome btw.<br />
<br />
I don't understand whiners though... you can create + merge under 5 minutes and you get free authenticator for account and one login for every blizz game, but some ppl of course have to QQ like they're loosing hand...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumps</div><div class="date">2009-10-10, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stupid question but... just HOW do you merge them? oO<br />
<br />
<br />
You go to google and type: battlenet<br />
<br />
then the first link should be to http://www.battle.net/<br />
<br />
Click that.<br />
<br />
Then click on the &quot;Create or Manage a Battle.net Account&quot; link<br />
On the next page click 'sign up now'<br />
Then follow the prompts.<br />
<br />
The email address you give them must be real, AND it will be the one you use for login in the future (instead of your account name).<br />
<br />
Once you login to your new battlenet account, you can enter your wow account information and the wow account will be merged with battlenet.<br />
<br />
If you buy new games you can merge them here as well.<br />
<br />
And you use the same login in all your blizzard games.<br />
<br />
(Makes it easier for the hackers ;-)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">harky</div><div class="date">2009-10-10, 10:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So that means there are 2 factors. Convenience factor (typing @) and security factor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Step 1: Create a new email.<br />
Step 2: Link account.<br />
Step 3: 'Remember login' option.<br />
Step 4: There is no step 4.<br />
<br />
Battle.net lets you register for betas, download all your old blizz games online, access Blizz store directly. Laaaaaaazy.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, its easier for a hacker, they only need to steal one password.<br />
Its easier for blizzard since you give them the right to monitor all your communication to ban you in all your games if you do something wrong in one of them. (&quot;We will never allow you to transfer to a PvP server&quot; ;-) )</div></div><hr />

People who subscribed to the Blizzcon internet event got the grunt pet on ALL of their merged wow accounts, so if you had accounts in Europe and American you got it on all. <br />

So presumably this is going to be the same here.</div></div><hr />

You can be on multiple accounts, run two copies of the game, log in, and select the two different WoW accounts, one per game client.</div></div><hr />

Sure, but if you have an un-merged account, and they manage to get your password, they can merge it to their own battle.net acct, and it'll be that much harder to get control of your acct back.</div></div><hr />

You can log on to the same battle.net multiple times simultaneously, but not the same WoW account. It makes multiboxing easier :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What? I have no idea is my account merged to battle.net or not, I guess I'll find out on november 12th then &lt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you login using an email (&quot;Daelos@example.com&quot;) or a username (&quot;Daelos&quot;)?<br />
If a email: You're merged.<br />
If a basic username: You're not merged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You realize that most passwords are just given away by their owners by actions like:<br />
- buying gold (give us your password and we will give you 5% more gold!)<br />
- buying powerleveling (100% SAFE!!!)<br />
- sending to gs email (use this form and you will get GM rights! this movie is a proof!)<br />
- downloading trojaned addons from some site because they cba to use popular portal<br />
<br />
Let's face it, many ppl are just too *intelligent* to not get &quot;hacked&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Assuming you have any.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
whatever Blizzard game they are currently playing etc, and only idiots would not want to merge. So Blizzard are giving them a hand the hard way.<br />
<br />
<br />
And people who are not sheep.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
9/10 people uses the same password for their email and WoW<br />
<br />

<br />
Yay, personal attacks because you know you haven't got a case.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because they people hacking WoW accounts have a major interest in other games.<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;other games&quot; would be your other wow accounts. If you have 2, 3 or 10 wow accounts you use the same login for all of them.<br />
And for all future games, like diablo 3 and starcraft 2 and what comes after.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(Also, those games can't be logged in to with the Battle.net account, they still use the old Battle.net, not the current log in.)They already do that. They log all chat already, there is nothing different. Also, maybe you shouldn't be doing something against the ToS, eh?<br />
<br />
<br />
If I do something and its against the tos, then the tos is amoral and wrong (since I don't do wrong things) - and its not their job to snoop.</div></div><hr />

Much easier to hack. Of course there doesn't seem to be anything which prevents you from making 4 battlenet accounts for 4 different games</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nezoia</div><div class="date">2009-10-10, 10:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a) Most likely you got an email with your account name in in your inbox somewhere, even if you don't use battle.net<br />
b) You signed up for a guild forum, or several for sure. Perhaps some other forums, related to other games, with that email<br />
c) Most people, including you, are keen to re-use the same password everywhere<br />
d) As in c), that goes for WoW too<br />
<br />
e) You sign up for my guild, I steal your account. Simple, and easy. <br />
<br />
Battle.net does not prevent or make this easier. But I'd vote the Battle.net login system for more secure in general. <br />
<br />
- Thinking you know more than Blizzard about security is stupid. <br />
- Thinking you know more than Blizzard about XSS attacks, or web/email scams is also stupid.<br />
<br />
In reality: You don't want to know how easy it is to get your personal information, because if you did, you would lock yourself into your house, and cut all wires to the outside world. <br />

If anything Battle.Net accounts over more security, because any time a hack has been made you can change the e-mail linked to the account to whatever you want. Assuming your computer is clean, that means any previous hackers now have no idea what your login is..<br />
<br />
Do not use the same password for your email and your battle.net account.<br />
Get an authenticator.<br />
Change your linked email if any hack attempt has been made.<br />
Make an actual attempt to keep your computer safe.<br />

Here's the thing. There's no reason NOT to merge. those who don't want to merge are either lazy because they don't want to take the time to do it, or are too scared of having their email as their log-in. You have absolutely nothing to worry about.<br />
<br />
<br />
blizzard shouldnt be alowed to force there customers into merging accounts<br />
<br />
Actually, You are using their intellectual property. You don't own your WoW account, you're technically renting it, and if you want to keep playing WoW or any of blizzard's other games, you'll agree to these changes. You agree to the fact that blizzard can do anything they want to your account the moment you hit that &quot;Accept&quot; button that you see when you first create your account and EVERY time a new patch drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You quote &quot;special&quot; as though the pet was advertised as the selling point of Battle.net. The word &quot;special&quot; appears nowhere on battle.net in regards to the pet, and the pet is only for players as a thanks for listening to them, merging when they were asked to and not quitting because you think the system is bad and coming back months later. In short, it's a thanks for not doing exactly what you're doing right now.<br />

If you consider 5 minutes to fill out a form, wait for two emails and click on a link a &quot;TREMENDOUS WASTE OF TIME&quot;, think of the amount of time Blizzard will be spending to support a legacy (old) login system. They will be wasting resources that I'm sure would otherwise be spent making bosses hard, epics epic and nerfing that class that keeps beating you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
think about it this way. everyone has wanted cross faction heirloom items, collectors pets, card game items. this is a nice and i believe only way to have blizzard allow these types of items cross faction. other than that the security is better and all your blizzard games will now be merged as well. to inlude a common chat between the games too.</div></div><hr />

Eventually, once they have a 2nd game that costs a monthly fee, you can bet they'll have a subscription plan that covers both games for a fee lower than what it would be individually to play both games. Sort of like how Sony did the Station account subscriptions, which was actually handled pretty decently (even if game development wasn't).<br />

And in the end, it doesn't matter if you want to merge or not. It takes a couple minutes of your time, and the benefits of not having to worry about losing your game discs far outweighs any hassle a few minutes of your time causes.</div></div><hr />

Much easier to hack. Of course there doesn't seem to be anything which prevents you from making 4 battlenet accounts for 4 different games<br />

Blizzard don't want your details so they can sell em to third party's, they are building a single, unified, structure that will cover all of there games. This is good for everyone in the long run, especially if you plan on playing another blizzard game in the future. As all you will need to do is add the cd key, and your away.<br />

I can: in my loc battle.net accounts works much-much worse then &quot;normal&quot; ones, they causes countless &quot;qq&quot; posts on forums coz this. And our &quot;support&quot; didnt work as well as EU (or US) do (for example - in-game tickets can be unreaded for 4-5 days...) so if &quot;shit happend&quot; (and in 85% it will) and my new acc will not work &quot;it will be good&quot; if i will be offline &quot;only&quot; for 4-5 days...<br />
<br />
So is this a &quot;good one&quot; ?... Or, maybe, you have more questions?<br />

Q: How do I log in if I’ve merged multiple World of Warcraft accounts?<br />
<br />
A: After you log in to World of Warcraft using the Battle.net Account, you will be prompted to select which of the merged World of Warcraft accounts you wish to play. Players with multiple World of Warcraft accounts are still able to log in and play them simultaneously.</div></div><hr />

this is just the same thing imo. merg or you cant play.<br />

is my opinion retarted to some people? yes probably.<br />

is my opinion un-founded? no its not.<br />
<br />
reguardles of how complicated it will be for me to make and merg 5 acounts with emails we have not used in years and game keys we cant find ( bought 5 sets of games - 5 vanilla - 5 bc - 5 woltk ) and atm we only have 1 set of games still available. so we are screwed either way. <br />
<br />
this system lets blizz and the players using it controll the acounts more easly, and i have no problems with that. however i play 1 blizz game ( world of warcraft ) i have no use for a battle.net acount wich is why i never made one. the consept of geting one started given my situation is enough, however having to log into everything with my email ( wich is long and anoying to type ) puts me off as well.<br />

this stunt lost 5 members $75 a month. oh well maybe ill spend that money and do a faimly movie night every month. we will have to see. oh and we were going to buy caticlysm so that wuld have ben another $250.</div></div><hr />

Er what? You can create a new email, it's not hard these days and keep the email addresses somewhere on a paper (or find out from acc management). And you don't really need to merge under 1 email, although you could. <br />
<br />
And it doesn't take very long to merge all 5, just acc name, pw is all. Then click the links in each email. No need for cd key.<br />
<br />
Btw, some companies do require you to change/merge accounts because they upgraded their tech. It's the same here. The reason we never upgraded is because there were initial problems with the b.net system.<br />
<br />

I had the same problem. I was like 12 year old or something when i started and made a new Wow e-mail :P... and i've totally forgot the name of it and the pass.

<br />
They can access backlogs of any kind of chat in the game. That doesn't mean they're watching everything you type to learn your dirty little secrets, but if they have a reason to investigate your account for any sort of infractions, they can look at all of your chat.<br />
<br />
Going abit offtopic here, but:<br />
Huh.<br />
As far as I remember from some part of the EULA I actually read, they don't record whispers, right?<br />

&quot;Q: What happens if I don&#8217;t merge my World of Warcraft account with a Battle.net account?<br />
A: After November 12, 2009, you won&#8217;t be able to log in to the game unless you merge your account with a Battle.net account. You will need to log in using your Battle.net account username (your email address) and password.&quot;<br />
<br />
I have merged my battle.net account long time ago, probably nearly as it was released for Europe. I wanted to sign for SC2 beta, and this was required. <br />
I can't complain about that, really nothing bad about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lemme merge, but let me login with my old username, that is only for wow.<br />
<br />
reason given for why not.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, there's no problem about them having your username or not. Last time I checked you need someone's password and not only the login-ID to steal it.<br />
<br />
While the hacking issue might not be one of the reasons at all (seeing as the main reason to merge is to get onto Battle.Net), if it is, it's about having an easier way of getting your account back if you GET hacked, rather than avoiding being hacked in the first place.</div></div><hr />

How you cannot get it?<br />
<br />
I DO NOT WANT that my username is actualy my email! <br />
<br />
Can you get it now? <br />
<br />
On top of that &quot;the most important email char = @&quot; is a bitch to type in.<br />
<br />
So that means there are 2 factors. Convenience factor (typing @) and security factor. <br />
<br />
So basically,<br />
A) You are too lazy to type in one email once and then put it on &quot;remember&quot;.<br />
B) ...uh, what the hell is that thing about &quot;security factor&quot; supposed to even mean...? No, really?</div></div><hr />

Not sure if it's been answered already, but if it hasn't:<br />
It puts up a list of the account names of all accounts you have merged to that email and asks, &quot;which World of Warcraft account do you want to log in to?&quot;. Confirmed as I have that list :).</div></div><hr />

See the ToU Section 17, paragraphs C and D (near the end of the page):<br />
<br />
C. Blizzard may, with or without notice to you, disclose your Internet Protocol (IP) address(es), personal information, Chat logs, and other information about you and your activities: (a) in response to a request by law enforcement, a court order or other legal process; or (b) if Blizzard believes that doing so may protect your safety or the safety of others.<br />
<br />
D. BLIZZARD MAY MONITOR, RECORD, REVIEW, MODIFY AND/OR DISCLOSE YOUR CHAT SESSIONS, WHETHER VOICE OR TEXT, WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, AND YOU HEREBY CONSENT TO SUCH MONITORING, RECORDING, REVIEW, MODIFICATION AND/OR DISCLOSURE. Additionally, you acknowledge that Blizzard is under no obligation to monitor Chat, and you engage in Chat at your own risk.<br />

Does not limit whisper out.<br />

Pokemon is also fun. Fun is a kind of indescribable feeling of enjoyment, something most people had when they decided to play WoW and/or post on forums, fyi.<br />

Edit: About Battlenet account mergers. Do people honestly think the game is going to break (aside from the usual breaking) because of this crap?

If they don't like it they can still simply drag it out of their inventory and enter DELETE. Done.<br />

Best thing I read here so far was something along &quot;Boohoo, whats the point in giving a special pet to everyone..then it's not special anymore.&quot; Why do *you* call it special then in the first place? Blizzard never mentioned &quot;you're going to receive the special ultra unique and rare penguin pet.&quot; They give out a pet to everyone. Just like ony whelp on birthday. I bet you're one of these people who complain about presents &quot;uh.. no I wanted the green mega ranger, leave my home and never come back again I hate you and I'm going to kill you and your whole family just because you gave me the red instead of the green mega ranger!&quot;</div></div><hr />

The penguin pet coming to us with the battle.net linking happens to coincide with their 5th anniversary.<br />
<br />
It's a free pet for everyone from Blizzard to say thanks for playing.<br />
Same as last year, we all got a free pet just for logging in!<br />
<br />
The only thing I am slightly annoyed with is Pengu's eyes no longer being red :(<br />
The new pet looks too similar and the red eyes on Pengu would have really set him apart.<br />
<br />
Other than that I have no problems with everyone getting the pet. After all it is an anniversary present for their customers!<br />
<br />
As for the battle.net merging being mandatory? It's about time.<br />
If you're worried about security, buy an authenticator. They only work on battle.net linked accounts and they cost bugger all.<br />
And for peace of mind on your account there really isn't much better you can do, short of never visiting any web-sites ever again.<br />

Prob because this is needed for the new Battle.net system that allows you to talk to players in other Blizzard games.<br />
<br />
- &quot;I don't want to use my e-mail everyone I know will know my account name!&quot;<br />
Then create a new e-mail adress. I play on an e-mail adress made just for this.<br />
<br />
- &quot;But my e-mail as account name would be soo long and it wil lhave symbols in it.&quot;<br />
Theres a 'save account name' option for a reason.<br />

- &quot;This is stupid!&quot;<br />

You get the pet as long as you merged before that date. If you have already merged, you still get the pet. The pet is just a &quot;thanks for merging on time&quot;.<br />

Now just on this thread alone it has been more than 2%, but let's just say 2% quit because of this, that's a tens of thousands of subscription paying people they will lose.<br />
<br />
Surely there has to be a better way of just making it optional, where by if you don't merge them you don't get any of the features?<br />
<br />
They could continue to make it optional like it currently is, but they would then be diverting resources away from other areas to maintain a bunch of legacy authentication servers. In doing so, maintenance times would be longer and those people who are apparently quitting because of this would instead be quitting because Blizzard are spending so long on server maintenance days that they can't take the wait.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When will we be able to get the pet?<br />
<br />
Likely sometime just after the 12th.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone have the same problem with me?<br />

<br />
- &quot;Why ?? It's useless!&quot;<br />
Prob because this is needed for the new Battle.net system that allows you to talk to players in other Blizzard games.<br />
<br />
- &quot;I don't want to use my e-mail everyone I know will know my account name!&quot;<br />
Then create a new e-mail adress. I play on an e-mail adress made just for this.<br />
<br />
- &quot;But my e-mail as account name would be soo long and it wil lhave symbols in it.&quot;<br />
Theres a 'save account name' option for a reason.<br />
<br />
- &quot;This is stupid!&quot;<br />
Get over it...<br />
<br />
There simply is nothing bad about this, it just requires a bit of work and I guess that is why you get a pingu in return.<br />
<br />

Good. Less idiots in the game.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to deal with it, then do it before the 12th so you don't have to deal with the busy servers on the BNet site.</div></div><hr />

So Blizzard are giving them a hand the hard way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, know this is an earlier comment but I still wanted to respond. <br />
<br />
I have already merged my account.... but if I had not, you would have instantly made me want to avoid it at all costs. My favorite part of this whole process is that the &quot;Real ID&quot; thing or whatever they have planned is slated to be entirely optional. <br />
<br />
If I don't tell you the names of my alts, there is a reason for it. If I don't tell you my username on other games, there is a reason. I have no interested in this cross-game platform system they're setting up (I also thought Steam was a stupid idea, only barely tolerable because you could set it to offline mode). I understand that it makes sense from the developer's side, but I'm quite content to maintain different circles of friends and associates for every game I play. I find guilds tend to do better when they focus on a single game anyways.<br />
<br />
<br />
On an unrelated note, I've not had any issues with my battle.net account. It's been just as fast, no downtime, and I've had no security issues.</div></div><hr />

Non Battle.net Accounts offline on November 12th<br />
Apparently, if you didn't merge your WoW account to a Battle.net account you won't be able to play the game after November 12th. The good news is, you get a free penguin! <br />
Q: What happens if I don’t merge my World of Warcraft account with a Battle.net account?<br />
A: After November 12, 2009, you won’t be able to log in to the game unless you merge your account with a Battle.net account. You will need to log in using your Battle.net account username (your email address) and password.<br />
<br />
Q: How can I obtain the penguin pet?<br />
A: Once you’ve successfully merged a World of Warcraft account with a Battle.net account, the penguin pet will be sent via in-game mail to all existing characters on the merged World of Warcraft account, along with all future characters on that World of Warcraft account. Players who merged previously will also receive the pet this way.<br />
<br />
Q: Do I need to merge by a certain date in order to receive the penguin?<br />
A: We plan to remove the ability to get the penguin pet at some point in the future, we haven’t determined exactly when just yet.<br />
<br />
Q: If I create a new World of Warcraft account, will I receive the pet?<br />
A: Only existing World of Warcraft accounts that merge with a Battle.net account are eligible to receive the penguin pet. If you create a new Battle.net account after November 11 and merge an existing World of Warcraft account with it you will still be able to receive the pet. However, please note that we plan to remove the ability to get the penguin pet at some point in the future.<br />
<br />
The penguin will most likely be Oswald (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55068/oswald/) (also known as Mr. Chilly, he was renamed in the latest PTR build of Patch 3.3 but Oswald is a nice name (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_%28comics%29) too), Mr. Chilly was the pet given to US beta testers who converted their account to Battle.net when the feature was on WotLK beta servers. Please note that Pengu (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44723/nurtured-penguin-egg/) was also changed in Patch 3.3 and doesn't have his scary red eyes anymore. <br />

Oh no, you have to spend five minutes making a battle.net account. FIVE MINUTES of your life wasted.<br />
<br />
Stop whining, this isn't a big deal. And Blizzard is giving you a motherfucking penguin pet for typing a couple of words in. There is no reason to complain.</div></div><hr />
