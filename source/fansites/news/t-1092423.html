Scroll of Resurrection Revamp - Free lvl 80 Character and more!<br />
The new Scroll of Resurrection revamp seems to be on live servers and includes a free level 80 character and a free character/faction change for the person you're bringing back to the game! We will probably get more information from Blizzard very soon.<br />
<br />
We can only assume that the Spectral Gryphon and Spectral Wyvern Mounts teaser (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2668-Cataclysm-Post-Mortem-Dungeons-and-Raids-Darkmoon-Faire-Issues-MMO-Report) from yesterday means people doing the recruiting also get nice perks.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Kaeh for his forum post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1092411-New-scroll-of-ressurection-amazing)!<br />

Idd, now we would have many lvl 1's being boosted to 80 and not knowing their class. The game is already in a very easy difficulty but why make it even more easier? next step: free lvl 85's (90's) in pandaria with full epics... and why skip all the content?</div></div><hr />

It does seem like it's an act of desperation and it's near the end of the 1st QTR. Looks like they're trying to soften the blow again.</div></div><hr />

PvP is the best thing about this game. Sure, it's easier to get the gear, but out playing someone with the same gear is much more gratifying than rolling them.<br />
PvP isn't easy unless you're at like 1550 rating, or if you're just referring to baddies in BG's.</div></div><hr />

2. I love seeing everyone here complain about things. The deep rooted issue is that you're unhappy with the game and are too addicted to actually step up and quit.<br />

3. The whole point in doing this is so that said persons reactivate their accounts thus getting $15 for every sucker who falls for this trap.<br />

4. &quot;Remember the good old days in WoW? I do, time to start playing!&quot; -- LOL the &quot;good old days&quot; are over, this game is nothing like it used to be, and the fact that they are using nostalgia to sucker more players in is pretty sad, but good move on their part.</div></div><hr />

Seems like they'll get a free mount.<br />

Honestly though, one of the biggest reasons why my friend stopped playing was the whole $70-80 issue just to catch up to date. They actually resolved it with this revamped scroll of resurrection.</div></div><hr />

Don't understand the hate, its not like they've never played the game before and their whole account is being put to 80. Its one char and with the free transfer and faction change its better for them to come back instead of spending so much money.<br />

I'm fairly certain it'll be included but I'm not jumping in on it 100% just yet. Might test it out once somebody I know signs on to confirm or not.<br />
<br />
On the level 80 thing; These people are supposed to have been playing prior. You're not recruiting somebody new - You're bringing back somebody who used to play. If you're bringing back somebody who doesn't know how to play it's your own fault.<br />
Luckily I have 3 people I can do this with already lined up.<br />
Friend with a spare account that, old ex of mine who wants to start playing again and a friend whose time is about to run out this week.<br />

There is a time limit on how long you must wait before you use this, so you can't just do it the second his account runs out, gonna probably be a few months till you could even use it on his account. (Assuming they don't renew)</div></div><hr />

You could look on it as a sign of desperation, or you can say that their subs losses of the past year has made them re-evaluate*their business strategy for the game. Now all they need to do is feed those returning more frequent content to keep them there, but I wonder if Blizzard's re- evaluation of their model goes that far.

I don't think that'll work unless there's a new criteria in this revamped scroll of resurrection. In the old one, the player you're sending the scroll to had to be inactive for 90+ days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Returning customers probably have played the content already, and they're still making you go through the worst of the content anyway (i.e., Cata's leveling zones). It's also just about reaching the 90 day mark for TOR and it's just in time to pull the rug out from under Game Update 1.2, and steal away all it's thunder.<br />
<br />
Marketing at it's finest.<br />
<br />
It's not marketed at new players, it's marketed at players who left in late Wrath and early Cata. You're not going to see brand new players come to the game with fresh 80s and not know what the hell they're doing. They are people who have probably played a fair bit, understand basics, and can learn. If you have idiots in your LFR.... yay? You can probably win without them. LFR is basically 10 man difficulty with 25 people (i.e., not at all challenging)<br />
<br />
As for 'What about our loyalty!?' What loyalty? The people who cry and whine the loudest about this are probably the same people who clear content quickly and stop playing, or threaten to quit because your Flavour of the Month class was nerfed, or whine when top level world first guilds clear content within a month and use that to gauge content difficulty for everyone.<br />
<br />
You don't have any loyalty to the game, you're here because you can't bring yourself to leave what you've invested money into. If another MMO was better and convinced you to leave that investment, you probably would. RAF and SoR do have loyalty benefits. You get stuff from them as well. You also get more time for things like Achievement drakes, rare spawns, heirlooms for enhanced leveling. New players (and a lot of lost subs) don't have these benefits. That is your benefit for loyalty. Stop being greedy little bastards.</div></div><hr />

Scrolls of Resurrection can only be given to people who have an account that's been inactive for a set amount of time, from a person with a currently active account, and there's a limit to the number of scrolls you can give out, IIRC.<br />
<br />
I never used the old Scroll of Resurrection system because the only friend I had who quit and wanted to come back lost all his account info and couldn't recover it. So I gave him the free veteran's reward account I got and signed him up with the Recruit-A-Friend feature.<br />
<br />
Also, for people who never used RAF, you can also grant people free level ups with that, too, up to level 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Long road to catch up: Start now, enjoy between 1 and 85 &quot;wasted&quot; levels just so you can catch up to your already established friends, and then do some additional catching up. <br />
<br />
Expensive to buy more than one expansion at a time: You pay alot for something you then need to pay per month to play.<br />
<br />
It's perhaps desperate, but it's also intelligent. I daresay they NEED to make something similiar for new people as well, atleast when it comes to startup costs, perhaps have Cataclysm keys unlock the 3 previous expansions as well or something along those lines. The current startup cost is immense, even moreso considering it's a monthly subscription on top of that, in addition to the fact that you won't really know if you like the game or not until you reach the real content which is endgame.<br />
<br />
Ohwell, it's a nice deal anyway for anyone who was thinking about returning, for sure.</div></div><hr />

Except it won't. It's Buy-to-Play, like Guild Wars was. So it only competes with WoW for your time. You can play both, same way people do with WoW and TOR, it'll just be substantially cheaper. I know this is pretty much how I see myself playing it.</div></div><hr />

It's classic marketing: get numbers by throwing your budget at the ones that left or are about to leave.<br />
Pretty much all subscriptions with semi-aggressive campaigns work like this. Phone companies, internet providers, Gyms, etc.. (hell, even banks!) don't reward you for being a regular, paying customer. But to join, or return, they'll load you up with gifts.*:rolleyes:<br />

<br />
I hate to say this because I really love this company and I have always welcomed every single one of their changes, but at this point it seems Blizzard just isn't having fun with the game. If you don't like your own work, how do you want players to like it ? You know, I'd like to say that I want them to stop for a moment and really fix what they think is wrong with the game but then I remember the backlash they would get for any tiny little change, it's really not an easy task. I feel WoW has grew into a living being on its own, Blizzard have seemingly lost any control over it. Not to Activision or any shareholder, oh no ... they've simply lost it to the community. When you start making your game based on statistical data and not on what you think would be fun and entertaining, it should be a great indicator that you're doing something wrong.</div></div><hr />

Scroll of Resurrection has to be gifted to an account that's been innactive for six or more months from a player who has an active account. And there's a limit on how many you can give out, IIRC.<br />

It's not like new people will be signing up for the game and getting to level 80 instantly.<br />

That's correct. It was 90 days under the old Scroll of Resurrection. Who knows, they might change it in this one if they're really desperate for people to come back.<br />

Blizzard has some real competition now with Swtor (no matter what you may think of it) and TERA as well as GW2 coming out soon. They need to do something to try to retain as many subscribers as they can. This is not a &quot;desperate&quot; move, this is a logical move. If you owned a store and several more stores opened in your area that sold similar products, you would take measures to make sure you kept as many customers as possible. That isn't desperation folks, that common sense. Also, to those complaining that Blizzard spent a lot of Cata development revamping the old zones and now returning players will be able to skip right over them...well, the revamped zones did not make them return, did they? So I guess they will not cry if they get shot up to 80 and skip them. And chances are if they stay subbed they will make some alts and see the content.*This RAF revamp is obviously meant to get previous players back and playing alongside their friends ASAP, which, let's be honest, is probably the most fun thing in WoW. running dungeons, pvping, questing etc. with friends. I am sure if there was not level boost with this people might come back, realize they have 85 levels to go through while their friends are at 85 doing other things without them. Not the best way to welcome them back to the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biged781</div><div class="date">2012-03-06, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure why this upsets people...<br />
<br />
First off, Blizz does not make money from selling copies of games (well, not a lot), they make money from subscriptions. As such, this is a very good incentive for people to start playing again. A company's #1 goal is to be profitable. If this lends itself to that goal then it is a good strategy. This does not signal the end and they are still by far the biggest and most profitable MMO on the market. That isn't going to change any time soon. And yes, companies do perform layoffs in order to streamline the company and be more efficient. It does not mean that they are about to go bankrupt, it means that they found redundancies and got rid of them. This happens all of the time. Anyone who thinks otherwise has obviously never worked a real job.<br />
<br />
Second, this is for returning players only, i.e., people who played and quit. Yes, there will be some who get to 80 and will not learn their class by 85, but does this not happen already? Do you really think this will become a bigger &quot;problem&quot; than it already is?<br />
<br />
Many of you just sound like jealous babies. Grow up.</div></div><hr />

That's the problem. An inactive person gets all this free stuff while we who already play would be forced to buy faction/server xfers which are insanely overpriced. They need to change the prices of these paid services or give current players a deal too because as it is currently this is unfair to people who have been actively playing, especially the ones on dead servers.</div></div><hr />

Demise? It's still got 10 million subs. Just because *you* don't play it doesn't mean it's going to die. The game has better end game (and has for years) than any other mmo. <br />
<br />
And as for pandas, wow has gnomes and blood elves too. People seem fine with Gnomes and have been from the start, but Pandas, no... that's just too much. The whole panda comment is silly. If you've played wow you'd know there are way sillier creatures in it.</div></div><hr />

totally agree. The reason I don't play anymore is because I'm bored and I don't enjoy leveling at all. Obviously blizzard is still losing a bunch of people if they're willing to upgrade cata for free and hand out 80s now.

You aren't entitled to anything for being subbed for 3 years. You got what you payed for. Quit being a child and understand how business works. Blizzard is a business. Subscribers are already giving them their money. Previous subscribers are not. Blizzard wants those players back and have put together a very enticing package to get them back. It's just business.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that the price of some of these services is too high. However, the level 80 boost is merely an incentive for players to return so that they may join up with their friends on even footing quickly instead of playing for 2+ months just to get to 85.<br />
<br />
Would I like a free level 80? Hell yes, I am leveling a mage right now and I just leveled a rogue. I would love to jump 40 levels overnight. However, I can see why they would do this, it makes sense, and if everyone were given level 80's for a fee the complaining would be even louder (and I would agree that is a bad idea).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tulani</div><div class="date">2012-03-06, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It does seem a tad extreme, but think about it. It's not like they're doing this for Recruit-A-Friend (IE, someone who's never played before (Ideally, at least :P)). Instead, they're doing this for people who have STOPPED playing. This would suggest that that player probably has or had a high level character - I know at least a few people who used to play the game in a different expansion, and considered coming back, but did not want to level again. <br />
<br />
Let's say that JohhnyQPaladin played back in BC, raided at level 70, then stopped. Now, if he wants to return, he has to level, but really, he just wants to check out the endgame content and play with his level 85 friends (leveling by yourself is pretty boring, after all!). Recruit-A-Friend doesn't seem enticing either for mainly the same reasons. So, this way, he can get to 80, level very little, and then start playing again with the old friends he hasn't played with in years. 5 levels is a lot less daunting than 10+, and most people would probably see it as a &quot;gentle introduction&quot; to the new game, rather than a tedious process. <br />
<br />
Also, the free transfers are because of another common reason people don't end up coming back or resubbing with the current incarnation of SoR: all their old friends have moved on to other guilds, other servers, etc. Who wants to come back only to realize that they know no one anymore, and that if they WANT to play with their friends and get help from them, they have to pay $25-$55? No way. <br />
<br />
Or perhaps JohnnyQPaladin DID play at level 85, but he really burnt out on his paladin after playing it for 5+ years, and that was why he quit. Chances are though, he had an alt (or at least a random level one on SOME server), and he thinks, &quot;I always DID want to try a mage...&quot;. With the current SoR, he'd either be forced to level a new character alltogether (&quot;but I just want to try out the free game time, I don't want to level in zones I've leveled a thousand times in!&quot;) or play the paladin he dislikes - either way, it taints his opinion of the new game. This way, he can come back and immediately start playing his Mage at a high level and with old friends, and possibly enjoy it more than he would have. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is smart. They realize that for a lot of players, the game is enticing - but the friends are what keeps people hooked. This isn't meant for people who are new to the game altogether. This isn't meant to be used to get your brand-new friend to level 85 so he can have no clue how to play his character. Will it be used in this way? Of course. But people already abuse RAF, and I think Blizzard figures that at least this way, those retired people will have one less reason not to come back. They're removing the barriers that might make a retired person go &quot;meh, it's just not worth it,&quot; the barriers that separate them from their friends that still play. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I just want to imagine that Blizz is listening to what people say when they give reasons for not returning, and aiming to do something about it. Of course this is a ploy for more money, don't ever think it isn't, but it's one that makes sense. What they're hoping is that the loss in revenue they take in giving free transfers is made up in the amount of people who wouldn't have resubbed, resubbing. (PS - if you think that it was &quot;a waste of time and money&quot; and regret doing RAF with your daughter and level with her from 1-85, then I think you missed the opportunity for quality time.)</div></div><hr />

This is much better than having a old friend spend 40$ for cata then $55 for a faction and server transfer to get the the server im on now(changed servers since they quit). Having your friend(s) back playing with you should be reward enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently you feel like playing World of Warcraft with your (likely) little daughter is good parenting and quality time. So is spending $60 for your daughter that terrible? Any regular sport or activity in which you can have your kids take place and learn social skills, playing in a team, developing cognitive capabilities through playing instruments learning to read notes etc. Will cost a hell of a lot more.<br />
<br />
I don't think playing an MMO with your daughter is that great of a decision. Especially when she is at a young age, that period is the most crucial for the development of a child and will serve as her fundamental knowledge and building blocks of her future education.<br />
<br />
So basically I'm saying QQ because I think its a horrible thing to do at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, not kidding.<br />
<br />
Sure, 1-60 is fast, but 61-80 isn't all that quick, and not all of us can sit and play wow for two or more hours per day. *I just leveled a rogue, full heirlooms and guild bonus. *It took me two months give or take. *You may have little going on in your life aside from WoW, but not all of us are in that situation. *Honestly it doesn't even matter if it is fast or not; it's the incentive. *Free 80 and I can try a new class? *Some will like the sound of that very much. *This is not an act of desperation, it is smart business practice kiddies.<br />
<br />
Also they may want to play a new class. *They may not want to pick up their old main. *This gives them a choice. *Again, incentive, and it costs Blizzard almost nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the idea is to get people back and up to end game where their friends are, since that is where the content is that people actual play and focus on. if people wanted to come back for cata for the 1-60, they prolly would have done so when it came out. this is only to get old players whom have been gone awhile back into game without having to grind to get there. another amazing idea on blizz's part. <br />
the mounts alone are going to have people re-recruiting :P</div></div><hr />

Its a scroll of res for people who played before with existing chars. Did you quit in vanilla with a 60? oh no you missed the new 1-60 but the quick 80 would by pass this.... wait.... I'm already 60 and missed it anyway because I used to play and already had a 60? oh.... then this just lets me bypass old content for leveling where I don't pay attention and don't bother with dungeons/raids because the goal is to get to endgame content.*<br />
And as for not knowing the classes they still have 80-85 which still takes a significant chunk of gameplay and most likely as former players they already have a decent grasp of their chars.<br />
<br />
TL:DR Former players will already have a 60+ toon so the 1-60 revamp skip is moot. As a former player they will already have a basic grasp of their class.*<br />
Great move on blizzes part to*incentivise former players on the fence to come back and play.*</div></div><hr />

Can you say, free level 80 Monk on release day?*<br />

I think so.*<br />

But...But...you wont know how to play your class :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Charblaze</div><div class="date">2012-03-06, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is... this is.... oh god. I'm going to go ahead and put this in the &quot;worst decision ever made&quot; column.<br />
<br />
Let's try to name all the consequences...<br />
<br />
1. People will abuse this for free 80s, then cancel their current account.<br />
2. It leaves the door 10 miles open for selling characters flat out.<br />
3. A flood of clueless players at 85 will occur.<br />
4. It's a system that stands to get little use (most WoW haters are WoW quitters and vice versa) outside abuse.<br />
<br />
1. If &quot;people&quot; have another account that has been subbed to WoW before but has been unsubscribed for a while, WHY NOT?<br />
2. This is obviously not a good method to get 80 characters. It takes like a few weeks now adays. TO get an 80 character the scroll of resurrection way, you're gonna have to BUY AN ACCOUNT, be INACTIVE IN THAT ACCOUNT FOR MONTHS, come back and get free 80s. too much of a hassle for people in china.<br />
3. I'm pretty sure if you're reviving someone who hasn't played the game before they will remember how to do it lmao. Even if that happens why does this affect you?<br />
4. You have seen the sub decreases for the past few months that were posted on MMO champ. those people quit. This can get them back. I'm pretty sure millions of people is not &quot;little use&quot;<br />
<br />
rethink your hate, please. This is an amazing idea</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wtf are you talking about.<br />
<br />
This is great and gets people back to playing the game WITH THEIR FRIENDS and more incentive to do so.<br />
<br />
1-60 revamp was great... the first time. I have no desire to do it again or level another alt. Even with the revamp it is still a grind to level up, even if it is faster.<br />
<br />
Chances are any friends that are recruited already know how to play the game (not like its hard) and have already done 1-60 anyways. <br />
<br />
I personally think this should be an option for those that are subbed for a certain amount of time anyways. I would love to have an 85 of each class but the leveling makes me want to tear my eyes out.<br />
<br />
This is a great move by Blizzard, this will bring a fair number of people back and just before an expansion is released, this is a great marketing decision.<br />
<br />
WoW is not dying by any means, I may not log in as much right now but I have other priorities but it doesn't mean I don't enjoy the game as much as I used to.</div></div><hr />

It means that they want people to have a stronger incentive to come back from the game if TOR wasn't their thing. And to people complaining about people not knowing their classes the time it takes to get from 80-85 takes about the same time as 1-60, leveling in WoW is nothing like PvP or PvE and most of the things you learn through leveling are irrelevant at max level. (Don't call me a fanboy. I no longer play wow anyway)</div></div><hr />

I don't mind the boost to 80 (IF it is only a boost), but free faction change/ realm transfer? So many people are complaining about this issue, I can see many people quitting for a month or two just for it.<br />
<br />
Also, is it definately just a boost, not insta 80? The 232 item sets worry me, noobs galore</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SamR</div><div class="date">2012-03-06, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really 80? Why not just make it 85? Sometimes I wonder wtf goes though their heads. All this does is make me wonder if they are worried about sub losses for there pandas. Keep on making the game easier and boring blizzard. Your making a good noose for yourself.<br />
<br />
It seems pretty obvious to me. They boost you to 80 and give you Cata. They want you to level through the Cata zones. It makes much more sense than a boost to 85 where you skip all the Cata zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Adding the word &quot;Boost&quot; in there can mean SO many different things:<br />
<br />
1: Your character magically dings to 80 from whatever level.<br />
2: You get an XXXX% exp gain from Quests<br />
3: Your Recruiter has to grant levels, reverse RaF-style.<br />
4: ??<br />
5: ?? <br />
<br />
~~~~~<br />
<br />
Anyone know exactly what they mean by &quot;Boost&quot; ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used a 7 free days to come back after just leveling to 85 in cata to play in 4.3. *Fortunately, most content is so mind-numbingly simple and most classes adequately stupid-proof that there is little to no risk of not being able to play at standard LFX levels even with zero prior knowledge of the game. *If anything, pre-4.0 fellows will be better able to adapt because they are used to things like talent-trees and non-linear questing that better equip them to be able to play at an acceptable level. *</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've tried to get co-workers and friends to play this game, but the fact that you have to put in months (and it is months for people who are completely new to the game) of leveling so you can start doing all the things you hear your buddies at work talking about ends up being a deal-killer.<br />
<br />
Maybe not a straight boost to 80 or whatever, but if Blizzard is ever going to start growing this game again, they're going to have to find ways to let newbies participate meaningfully with their max-level friends.</div></div><hr />
