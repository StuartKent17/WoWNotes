Yup, that was my first though as well. Although as someone said, might just be a promo rather than an actual scene in the movie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But then it showed this weird ass recorded scene as if we - the orc - ran at the alliance soldier; and I just fucking cringed.<br />
<br />
Please tell me I'm not the only one. I have decent hopes for this movie but they better not put pov shit that badly cut / produced into the movie.</div></div><hr />

The first scene is located in Burning Steppes, I believe. You can clearly see Blackrock Mountain and Dun Morogh's snowcapped mountains.</div></div><hr />

From literally 100% of the things I've seen, it looks great and, most importantly TO ME, has the Warcraft feel. Whether or not it will be successful who knows. I care, but I'm not sure.<br />
<br />
But everything I've seen so far looks fantastic for me as a fan.</div></div><hr />

It's all so squeaky clean and the set pieces look so... spray painted and fake. Look at the wall and that box in the dwarf screen cap, lothars(?) clothing in the same cap... that bothers me so much. And granted that skull doesn't get much actual screen time but it looks SO BAD in the first cap, it looks like something tacky you'd buy at friggen walmart for a Halloween lawn decoration.<br />
<br />
Still crossing fingers for a good movie though.</div></div><hr />

Real world dwarves, at least the once I've seen, would be more akin to tall gnomes than Dwarves, who are half muscle.<br />

Dunno how that looks black to you. It's very very dark red. Like a dark rosewood or maroon. And it's pretty obvious that the people making the movie are taking some liberties with the details. Blizzard is involved so green will probably become a possible color for their blood. They'll just say those most corrupted had pure demon blood in their veins or something like that.</div></div><hr />

Would you preffer it to be like one of the movie trailers we have seen lately? Where you basicly see most of the story/sketches/scares (depending on the genre) within the trailer itself?</div></div><hr />

That's part of it, for sure. I don't want to spend time picking it apart - it is what it is, it will make it's money back at least, and some people will enjoy it, but I'm just not feeling it. Life will go on.</div></div><hr />

That female orc (is it Garonna?) Looks out of place though. They probably should of done CGI too. It doesn't seem to &quot;fit&quot; for me.<br />
<br />
She is Halforcen (half human and half orc in one book at least), so that's why they let her look somewhat out of place.</div></div><hr />

Why is the girl orc the only orc not CGI (forgot the actresses' name)?<br />
<br />
It's not a girl orc, it's a half-orc. She's supposed to have a normal build.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is the dwarf CGI? You can't find a fucking dwarf human and put makeup on him? Is that too much work?<br />
<br />
Same reason the Orcs are CGI. Forced perspective and makeup on actors gets you the Hobbit (shrunk down bearded humans), it doesn't get you Warcraft dwarves, who are drastically different from humans in their body structure. Their arms go down to their knees and their forearms are thicker than their heads.<br />
<br />
Also, to the edgelords complaining about PG-13, all Warcraft games have been rated T, so a Fury Road type R doesn't even fit the property. LOTR was darker than this and it was PG-13. There is absolutely no reason to have this movie be an R unless you want it to be a financial failure.</div></div><hr />

I also really don't understand people complaining about there not being much new footage in comparison to previous previews. Unless it's a crappy movie where the entire movie is revealed in the trailer, that's what trailers usually are. Look at the Star Wars trailers for example, at least the US ones. Between the first and final trailers I'd say only 10-15 seconds of footage were added. Do you really want the entire movie ruined?</div></div><hr />

I've to say, the PG-13 broke my heart every time :(<br />
<br />
Dark Knight and Taken were PG 13, as were The Ring and Grudge (US remakes) and the LotR/Hobbit trilogies. Also, we just saw Lothar crotch-slash Blackhand complete with green blood splashing, so it'll be plenty violent.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackhand has Raptor spinal columns as capes. How fucking badass and metal is that?<br />
<br />
I give it 5 out of 5 Brutals<br />

The CGI sticks with the game pretty close, for some that is a lackluster...but for others that feels pretty awesome.<br />
<br />
I myself am in between, I prefer better CGI effects...but I really like how close they are with the game in terms of looks.<br />

<br />
On multiple occasions as well:<br />
<br />
&quot;Beside Grom was the enormous, imposing Blackhand of the Blackrock clan.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Orgrim marched only a step behind Blackhand, the hulking and intimidating leader of the Blackrock clan.&quot;<br />

The game is rated T, why the hell should the movie be rated R?<br />

I so badly want this movie to be good, but I have my doubts. I am going into it with pretty low expectations so maybe I'll be pleasantly surprised. Please be good.</div></div><hr />

I think america is obsessed with this move. It recently happened on Riddick (was on tv a few days ago).<br />
<br />
Probably so.<br />
<br />
I know their movies have more of the so called cliche scenes:<br />
<br />
Someone always running or busting through a pane of glass.<br />
Walking in slow-mo toward the camera as something blows up in the background.<br />
Sliding under the enemy. (check)<br />
In the path of something dangerous? Just stand there watching it come closer and stare at it.<br />
Advice to not do something foolish. Just do it anyway.<br />
Someone in one group or another is an outcast.<br />
Muscular people always pick up something heavy to throw,drop or pull over on someone.<br />
Someone dying lives just long enough to say something slightly to really important.<br />
Something along the lines of, we must protect our family/lifestyle.<br />
In a fight the with the least practical weapon will win at an important moment.<br />
Being in the wild for more than a day will always have you running into a hungry animal.<br />
Heroes always ask, is that the best you can do?<br />
<br />
<br />
The list goes on. I expect this movie to be filled with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Narnia movies had 3 movies so it was hardly a flop.<br />
<br />
Percy Jackson 2.<br />
<br />
Hobbit managed to split 1 story into 3 parts... each of which was highly profitable.<br />
<br />
There are movies hat despite critic rating or rotten tomatoe ratings manage to be profitable.<br />

The CGI is the least to be worried about for the movie people. Every big budget movie works on their CGI until the very last minute nowadays. See how bad that spiderman CGI was in Civil War trailer? yea it'll look 10x better in the movie. Youtube's shitty as 1080p video compression =/= 4k resolution in a theatre screen/IMAX.<br />

Depends what you mean by &quot;removed&quot; ... it's a hard story to tell without something -- so it's either puppet/suits or CGI. I don't think the CGI in this movie is any worse than the Hulk or the Avengers or X-Men.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would probably rather have bad CGI, you're right (as opposed to Star Wars / 90s Ninja Turtle style suits). But if the story and characters are good ... i can get past it. It's a movie with lots of non-humans in a very alien world. Puppets, suits, and the New Zealand landscape wouldn't be enough.<br />
<br />
Plus, CGI never ages well so someday this movie and movies made these days will be the &quot;old fashion way, like older movies&quot; .... if the characters and story are good, it will hold up, despite laughable effects.<br />
<br />
The scorpion king wasn't bad because of graphics ... it was terrible story-telling and bad graphics just made it worse.<br />
<br />
Ironically (if we are being liberal with the term), this concept is true of video games. Graphics rarely ruin the experience.</div></div><hr />

Would you preffer it to be like one of the movie trailers we have seen lately? Where you basicly see most of the story/sketches/scares (depending on the genre) within the trailer itself?<br />

Or they could of done what was done with the Terminator Genysis trailer and basically give away the whole story with in the trailer..<br />

The things that would make it R - extreme language, extreme violence, drug use, and nudity, have no place in a Warcraft movie. The demo market for this film is squarely the pg-13 crowd.</div></div><hr />

I don't like this theme of making orcs look 5 times larger just to show they're an important character, like what they did to many of the warlords in WoD like Blackhand. They're still normal orcs! Stop making them insanely large, we want normal orc to human size ratios! :'(<br />
<br />
If someone is trying to kill you with a large metal axe, there is no such thing as a &quot;dick move&quot;. <br />
<br />
I think that's what I'm having issues with - the orcs are just too goddamned big...with tiny human sized eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly, Orcs shouldn't be 8 feet tall; when they're placed next to the (clearly greenscreened) human actors (that look like they've wandered in from a Game of Thrones set), it becomes abundantly clear to me that there will be a lot of &quot;yeah, ok&quot; moments when it comes to humans fighting orcs in the movie. The slide to first base that Lothar did there was an example of this (totally unconvincing), and you'd think that any self-respecting 8 foot tall orc would be able to punt him away with a little swipe from his stop sign sized club. <br />
<br />
Secondly, I would expect Lothar to look the part; his presentation and body shape are not so intimidating when put in that armor, and especially not so when you consider how itty bitty the humans look next to the orcs. <br />
<br />
In my opinion, they really, really should have cast some more grizzled looking actors; the Stormwind army only conscripts children in this new cinematic universe, apparently. I mean, we've already seen two kids smashed to a pulp by giant clubs in the trailers. <br />
<br />
I'm guessing this will be an &quot;all hope is lost&quot; movie. Eugh.</div></div><hr />

still extremely dubious that it will make them any reasonable profit after all of their expenses, and somewhat meh about the movie itself...<br />
<br />
The cost of this movie is in the range of 100 and 200 million USD.<br />
<br />
Judging by the Facebook &amp; Youtube likes, the movie will deffo cash in at least $500 million and that's more than enough for a sequel.</div></div><hr />

Warcraft (to be released internationally as Warcraft: The Beginning)[3] is an upcoming 2016 American epic fantasy film directed by Duncan Jones and written by Chris Metzen. It is based on the Warcraft video game series and novels set in the world of Azeroth. The film stars Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell, Ben Schnetzer, Robert Kazinsky, Daniel Wu, Ruth Negga, Anna Galvin and Clancy Brown. The film portrays the origin story of the initial encounters between the humans and the orcs, with an emphasis upon both sides of the conflict, and will take place in a variety of locations established in the video game series.[4]<br />
<br />
The film was first announced in 2006 as a project partnership between Legendary Pictures and the game's developer, Blizzard Entertainment.[5] Filming began on January 13, 2014 and concluded on May 23, 2014. The film is set to be released by Universal Pictures on June 10, 2016.[1]<br />
<br />
Blizzard didn't license it, they're making it WITH Legendary, and Metzen wrote it. You can blame Blizzard all you want - they're responsible for it. <br />
<br />
Anyone still astonished?</div></div><hr />

It will for sure make it's money back, and then some, especially when it hits disks and streaming, but I'm not expecting it to break any box office records or win any awards. It'll be a good summer popcorn movie, and that's not terrible for them at all. I suspect a great many people among the 7 million who quit playing will wait for it to hit Redbox/Netflix.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Writer - Duncan Jones<br />
Writer - Charles Leavitt<br />
<br />
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Leavitt<br />
He re-wrote the 2015 film Seventh Son and the 2016 film Warcraft<br />
<br />
Are you citing a rumour from 2012?<br />
<br />
<br />
2012 Edit<br />
<br />
As of early 2012, the movie has still not been announced to be in production, so the chances of it being made are getting lower by the year. At Comic Con 2011, Chris Metzen said the movie was not dead, but gave few useful details saying it was still in the &quot;treatment stage&quot;.[45] In mid-March 2012, Nethaera said the movie is &quot;still on the radar&quot; with no other update.[46]<br />
<br />
According to IMDB, the manuscript writer will be Chris Metzen. (Jesse Wigutow was mentioned, but has been removed).[47] IMDB information on pre-release movies should be taken as suspect, though. IMDB generally only removes false information if someone reports it. <br />
<br />
In some ways they are making it with Legendary but they aren't the camera crew, or even the full on production stuff. Blizzard would be consulting on the project, after all it is their IP.</div></div><hr />

I think the movie looks good so far to me, but of course I will wait to see it to pass judgement. I like how the dwarf looks in the trailer, it would be stupid to make them look too much like LoTR. They are trying to make something different, just go in with an open mind, let go of your anger(until you see it). Either way there will be whiners, but I am hopeful. I have faith in Duncan Jones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a former US Marine, I agree. If anything, the opposite should be to blame, and that is showing militaries in less than pristine uniforms all the time. I mean, look at WoW as the worst offender. We loot brand new items in the game that are chipped, and worn and rusted. Hell crafted items that are literally brand new have flaws in them.</div></div><hr />

Much better trailer than they've shown so far. The only time I don't like the green screen and think it looks horrible is still the Stormwind shot. It's not even that it's bad, per say. Just that it looks off. I thought the dwarf looked ok, though.<br />
<br />
Stormwind looked somewhat better compared to last trailer. But yeah we aren't much time in SW in the movie, so I'm not too worried.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Besides that so epic and i hope they are able to compete with Lord of the Rings (reasonable the movie to compare with). But: consider! Lord of the Rings has a good and easy story: is World of Warcraft capable to deliver that to a for example 50 year old mother who got forced by his child ! Does she understand the (World of) Warcraft story? Other than that it would only be fighting, but if I see the history of (World of) Warcraft, there are more things to consider (important persons) or so, which many people forgot. Dont forget: the movie is called Warcraft, not World of Warcraft. I assume we see more expensions? Would love to see a flyer (handout) in the cinemas to understand the story behind Warcraft (many people dont or didnt even read and play dialogues or RolePlay or quests/small movies and skipped it)</div></div><hr />

It's stated to be at 100mio, but in the articles it was described as &quot;nort of 100mio&quot;. Universal considered it to be a problem movie because it has such a high budget, which feels weird. 100mio doesn't sound a lot for a fantasy epic movie. Hobbit was somewhere between 200 and 315mio, the latest Star Wars was 200mio.<br />
<br />
I'm honestly afraid they'll end up saying the movie is 100 minutes long in the end. That would be a problem.</div></div><hr />

known actors alone took a lot of the budget, i dont know how much Ian took, but for example RDJ alone took 50m budget from the avengers and iron man 3<br />
<br />
you can create a whole movie with RDJ budget.<br />

warcraft dont have any super high budget actor, so lots of the money is going on the production rather than actors or director</div></div><hr />

That's very true. Harrison Ford took 20mio alone from the SW budget. I honestly hope Warcraft movie ends up being good, wouldn't mind this going into a trilogy, but I feel that everybody - meaning fans, studios, critics - is expecting it to fail miserably. Underdog movie of 2016 for sure. :)</div></div><hr />

But think about it, if you ever done military service... they have a crazy fetish for keeping the uniform clean and polished.<br />
<br />
People think it's too clean and polished because they have been spoiled by that cliche of basically every medieval / fantasy film out there ever with armour rusted and covered in shit. I mean how could people possible clean their stuff 500 years ago, they didn't have the tech! And more importantly, why would they? It's not like people in the dark age would even want to look clean, it's unheard of! <br />
<br />
If you want to make someone look like a proper warrior you slap some half arsed ring mail armour on him, cover it with dirt and you're good to go. Totally authentic medieval costume. Even better, ditch the mail and just use some leather with spikes! I mean, leather got to be cooler then mail after all? And we all know that the cooler you look, the more functional the armour...</div></div><hr />

I think someone might have issues. I don't think the movie is going to be good either, but how can your life really be so vapid and empty that one of your moments of waiting excitement is seeing a movie not do well for a franchise you think is shit and lurking on the forums for that game? I really hope you're young, like 13 and not an adult, because that's an embarrassing thing to admit to if you're any older. <br />

No, I'm complaining about the CGI because I don't think it looks good, ultra realistic is not the angle you want to be going for when using Warcraft for inspiration, where even the Humans have proportions that would make Superman blush. The real people look awful when pasted onto the CGI and the Draenor Scenes and the Azeroth Scenes look like they're from different movies. That Dwarf pants next to Lothar, Gimli didn't have this problem 14 years ago.<br />
<br />
It can be as cutting edge as you like, that noone can deny, but its separate from it looking aesthetically pleasing.<br />

Not like it matters whether this movie succedes or not. <br />
<br />
If it doesn't, blind fans will say it was poorly advertised (which it's been), or that Legendary didn't pay enough (which they didn't). <br />
<br />
If it does, blind haters will say that people nowadays will watch anything with CGI (which they do) and that box office doesn't mean a movie is good (which it doesn't).<br />
<br />
Me? I'll probably enjoy it just for the references, but then again, I will watch pretty much anything and have a good time. I don't have any money invested in this movie, so I'm not about to lie to myself if it is, or does, bad. But besides an amateur marketing team, I'm not seeing the problem with this movie yet.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Part of it is getting the date right. As you may have noticed, these next two years, there are pretty big titles coming out. We wanted to make sure that we got that right, but there are some sequences and some things that Duncan Jones has done that are truly on the cutting edge.<br />
<br />
You want to have plenty of time to make sure that we dial those in. So by the time they get home and set up, it'll be a little less than two years. It'll be about 20 months but we really want to take our time and get this right because the technology that's employed really is some next generation stuff.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Man, are you in for a seriously rude awakening. Love how you've already setting up an escape clause for your outraged denial once the movie flops as badly as it is going to flop though. But it's cool, we all know you guys need to maintain the sense that you haven't wasted the last ten years of your life on a shitty franchise. We get it. (Doesn't mean we're going to stop laughing, of course, but we get it.)<br />
<br />
I don't see why people get so bitter about WoW, you people treat it like an ex girlfriend who dumped you for another guy and now you obsessively stalk her FB page and hope to see her dumped by her new boyfriend. I enjoyed many games, like Skyrim and WoW, for long amounts of time because they were fun. When they stopped being fun, I stopped playing, it's as simple as that. You might call it wasted time, but time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.</div></div><hr />

Universal considered it to be a problem movie because it has such a high budget, which feels weird. 100mio doesn't sound a lot for a fantasy epic movie. Hobbit was somewhere between 200 and 315mio, the latest Star Wars was 200mio.<br />
<br />
I'm honestly afraid they'll end up saying the movie is 100 minutes long in the end. That would be a problem.<br />
<br />
Blizzard spent all their time and money making Warlords of Draenor the best most content rich expansion we ever had so they didn't leave much of a budget for the movie. Especially since they make very little money off World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

I just hope that blizzards makes a stament saying how wc1,2 lore sucked..and that with the movie they are improving the cannon.Just like star wars did with force awakens for expanded universe.Evertying else..is ok<br />

Okay, thank you for providing a source, but I'm sorry to say its an incredibly biased one. So the CEO of the company publishing the movie says it looks good and is next gen. Of course he does. He's trying to sell tickets and next gen is a buzzword. That's also not &quot;experts&quot;. Its 1 guy who has a vested interest in the movie doing well because he invested several millions of dollars in it.<br />
<br />
I still don't think it's aesthetically pleasing to look at for the reasons I said, regardless of it being cutting edge graphical fidelity. I never said the CGI looked bad. I said I didn't like the way it looked. His opinion doesn't overrule that. Being cutting edge doesn't automatically mean the thing is pleasing to look at.<br />

Yeah but there's a difference between a larger than normal orc, and literally 2x the scale of an average orc. Hmm, I guess they can do what they want as it's a magical, fictional universe but it would have been nice if it felt more realistic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He doesn't look twice as big as other orcs, you can see him with Rend and Maim on either side of him in the shot from the Blizzcon trailer where Durotan is taking off his wolf cape and he only looks slighty larger than them. The new shot where Lothar slides under him just has forced perspective that makes him seem bigger than he is.</div></div><hr />

Well, that's one way to look at it, sure. I have no idea what they gain by doing so. It doesn't look wowish, it looks shitty, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
The problem is that Warcraft's version of Orcs is very stylized. You have to stay true to that design (to a certain extent) so that when people see it, they recognize it immediately as WoW.<br />
<br />
That being said, as the person you are responding to mentioned. WoW itself and Warcraft has remained very &quot;cartoony&quot; a design choice that is often criticized. So when you bring that to the silverscreen there are going to be elements that are cartoony. Elements that according to physics don't make sense. Oversized weapons, oversized shoulders... the teeth/tusks of orcs.<br />
<br />
Ultimately though you have to look at what the movie is trying to accomplish and the vision of directors/producers. Are they shooting for fantastic artistry and showmanship? Like Peter Jackson and LotR? Or are they simply trying to make a fun movie capitalizing on WoW's notoriety?<br />
<br />
Also you have to look at source material. LotR had never really been attempted. We got a goofy cartoon for the hobbit...<br />

<br />
Bottom line, you could criticize his design if you really wanted to. I am not a film maker, but perhaps there were even scenes that could have used a little more cgi and looked better or the same and been more cost effective?<br />
<br />
Bottom line is a design choice/preference isn't really going to make or break the movie. The story will...</div></div><hr />

Be real for a moment here. No way are they going to cater to the wow community when making a big production like this. It will be made to draw in as much people as possible and not to alienate those not familiar with the source content. See, i was a wow player (sub running out) and even i didn't know this. I guess i'll just wait and see it in motion properly. Since i'm familiar the basic story they want to show, the design choices might just make or break it for me, as you say.</div></div><hr />

I hate to break it to you, but you sound pretty bitter already.<br />
<br />
So you think this entire movie is a marketing ploy to get people interested in their mmo? I think that's a huge stretch. I think the marketing campaign for the movie in general is pretty poor. Which leads me to believe that they are relying heavily on fans (past and present) to carry the movie in the box office.<br />
<br />
(1) The trailers and marketing doesn't explain very well what is &quot;warcraft&quot; so for someone who has not yet been exposed its not a very compelling story.<br />
<br />
(2) For people familiar with the franchise most are being REALLY critical... but good or bad we are still going to see it, so its money in their pocket.<br />
<br />
As for the game and whether or not it will get you fired up to keep playing... Legion is the other half of the expansion we SHOULD have got in WoD... so my bet is on you playing it powering through it and hating it more than you do now.<br />
<br />
Really though my post that you quoted wasn't advocating a &quot;realistic&quot; depiction or production process but was merely pointing out that the movie just wasn't created for that. Warcraft (which has always had a bit of goofiness to its art) lends itself more to a stylized version (and more appealing to a wider audience) then say a super serious, super realistic, and ultimately darker version.<br />
<br />
So if you (as in everyone) still aren't getting it, Warcraft deals with some pretty dark themes, dark in terms of what view the subject matter culturally... its not JUST a fantasy story. There are things like zombies, demons and demon possession, death (blood and gore), sacrifice, soul stealing/rending, the occult, murder, genocide, rape, racism... one way to keep those (very heavy) topics light, is to keep it a little unrealistic (stylized) visually, it makes seeing these topics in action a little less impactful/easier to stomach.<br />
<br />
Perhaps this is the kind of realism you were hoping for:<br />

Heh. I am genuinely curious as to if the movie will have some intended goofiness to it. One of my first toons was an orc, and in the starting area is a quest to go smack the crap out of some lazy peons with a stick and get them back working. The Kobold poster prop eludes to a bit of in-game fun stuff, so I hope it isn't all &quot;RAWR!!&quot; serious.</div></div><hr />
