<br />
The program will be trialed during 2018 Season 3 quarterfinals matches across all regions, from Dec. 28, 2018, through Jan. 12, 2019. The Path to Pro team then will evaluate the program’s overall effect on creating a more positive viewing experience.<br />
<br />
To link your Battle.net and Twitch accounts, log into Twitch, visit https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections, and select the “Connect” option under Blizzard Battle.net. Users who try to chat with unlinked accounts will be met with an automatic reply and prompted to link their accounts.<br />

Follow the official Contenders Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/overwatchcontenders), and watch the official Path to Pro Twitter (https://twitter.com/owpathtopro/) for more updates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who is talking about hatespeech? In the bigger picture this looks more like a data gathering move to sell more of those cheer bits and other fluff in the future and monetize the streams even more. I doubt this has much to do with moderation at all, even if they bring it like that. That being said, better moderation on Twitch should not be bad, years ago Chat there was generally fun and had some good discussions. These days its all about braindead emote spam it seems. Doesn't make Twitch more attractive imho.</div></div><hr />

Well there is nothing worst than a corporate greed and data gathering in the hand of whom thinks to be the most ethic. It is how totalitarian regimes are usually born.<br />

As someone living in Europe you need to be daft as hell to not figure out which part of yours is the most left. I mean...come on think for 1 minute at least. Every country has a similar party. France, Finland, Sweden, Germany, UK, etc. Maybe use your brain for a little and put 2 and 2 together. Only difference is a different name.

Or, you could actually realise not as many people over here give as much of a feck as they do in the USA, and don't rant on and on about it in public forums? <br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, I have played on both EU and USA servers, and can tell you that on a game with a worldwide server, the general chat mostly takes a turn for the worse once the USA guys and gals start logging on. As soon as they do, it is usually a rant about Trump/Anti-Trump that distends into a ramble abotu SJWs and the same nonsense over and over.<br />

<br />
'Social justice' ideology is the most blatantly racist collection of ideas I have ever come across.<br />
The practice of actively dividing and assigning everyone into 'cookie cutter' identity groups - stripping individual agency by recognizing those prefabricated contexts INSTEAD OF anything the the individual values or does - and giving people 'identities' based on things that have nothing to do with the individual - is prejudice. And prejudice based on race is racism.<br />
<br />
The split you're seeing is people moving towards 'Libertarian' to push back against 'Authoritarian'.<br />
<br />
Those who think it's all about 'left vs right' are fundamentally misunderstanding the situation.<br />
<br />
The media (controlling the Overton window), academia ('social justice' ideology), and establishment political parties (globalism) are all trending towards authoritarianism.<br />
<br />
This is unacceptable.<br />

Not even close no.<br />
<br />
Not a single democratic party in Europe would call the US Democratic party &quot;left&quot;.<br />
In Switzerland they would be categorized center-right. And most likely same in any of the main EU countries.<br />
<br />
When in Europe we have a left/right debate. It's actually that.<br />
When the US have a left/right debate. It's the economic right wing VS alt right nutjobs.<br />
<br />
There is no left in US with any political force, period. Thus making the clivage VERY different in Europe and the United States.</div></div><hr />

Not a single democratic party in Europe would call the US Democratic party &quot;left&quot;.<br />
In Switzerland they would be categorized center-right. And most likely same in any of the main EU countries.<br />

Can't we all just agree that Twitch chat was, is, and continues to be completely stupid and spammy? Any stream with 100+ viewers devolves into people spamming the same over-used, unfunny memes and emoji. Nobody actually talks to each other in the chat, it's the equivalent of wearing noiseproof headphones, going into a stadium with thousands of people who do the same, and screaming dumb stuff repeatedly.</div></div><hr />

I disagree, I like twitch chat. It can be funny and its refreshing no nonsense stupidity is sometimes all I want when I'm watching a game. If I don't like it i'll close it.<br />
<br />
Also plenty of streamers with over 100 viewers have the sort of chat you mean, check out Lifecoach for example. It's nice to have a mixture as you aren't going to be able to have meaningful discourse when there's 50k people in a chat for an esport.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You just need a edgy mod to overreact and do something that they shouldn't because they're feeling powerful. As long as it was confined to their own stuff (usually that specific twitch channel or twitch itself), it was ok. Now it does not look ok if they're taking things outside of their own service since no system is 100% perfect.<br />

Yeah, you can just close the chat and not be bothered by it anymore.<br />
<br />
Just like how people say that if you don't like a tv show, you can just turn off your tv or switch channels. But somehow they can't turn off the chat that they think it should never exist because it's a &quot;cesspool&quot; or whatever.</div></div><hr />

I doubt this actually has a lot to do with moderation, although they claim this.

also while i agree that European &quot;left&quot; is actually more left than it is in the US, the US one is still on the left.. and far left actually exist there and its as bad as far right<br />

A private company banning your account for words said in another private companies chat room. The book was about the overreqch and authroritativeness of the government on social interaction. By connecting the accounts, blizz can literally be thought police and ban your entire account because something you say or have said on another private companies site.

The mere fact that it is introduced is enough to have fewer people who will follow these events via chat.<br />
It does not matter how many people use the chat for non-politically correct purposes, what matters is how much confidence you have on the impartiality of these people who can delete the library, arbitrarily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What people say isn't always the genuine reason. Looking at the broader picture it just looks like Blizzard is going to want to start to monetize the streams. They are already longer busy to get their userbase to link b.net, for example with WoW you could get a title if you linked B.net, this with overwatch and with Hearthstone it seems a few months ago they were actually testing the monetization as you could buy bits, use these to cheer at hearthstone teams and get ingame rewards in hearthstone (more rewards the more bits you bought). Seeing this happening in don't really buy into moderation needed excuse as the full and only reason. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense and it makes even less sense to ban b.net users based on what they say on twitch (unless they go really really far and out of line), as these users are what they at the moment need as a company, MAU's for their stock reports.</div></div><hr />

<br />
apparently they do. They need a place to spam and spew out anything that comes to theyre mind. Its a place where people say whatever they want while spamming pepehands and other weird stuff. <br />
<br />
Anytime I enter a stream with alot of people its always just random shite written in chat. nothing of interest. So I usually turn it off or put on full screen. With that in mind, I dont get why Blizzard does this. Im not bothered with the chat even though I find it stupid, I just turn it off.<br />
<br />
But alot of people has a big need of writing nonsense over and over again in chat. Those people are now mad and I could not care less.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look at it like this: When people go to watch football(soccer) on a stadium, they yell out a lot of stuff, but also there its a limit and a line not to cross. You cant enter any big stadium in EU and spew out whatever while everyone sits and listen to you. Toxic people who creates a negative atmopshere gets thrown out. <br />
<br />
Maybe Blizzard is thinking along those lines with chat. I dont know. Maybe.</div></div><hr />

Is Tryhard offensive? To whom? A white liberal pile of trash that makes the assumption that some black guy face is offensive to be used? (that they themselves said it was fine to use )and therefore they themselves implying it's racism? because they are in fact racist?<br />

What they want to start, what they are advertising and what they will have power on are separate things.<br />
Is their goal to monetize streams? Good, but since a couple of years the only reason Kaplan is giving is to &quot;purge toxiciy from the community&quot;, without even defining what toxicity means for them, so if the ultimate goal is stream's monetization, well, they are doing it in the wrongest way possibile.<br />
I simply don't trust a company like those which feels to show virtue signaling to a toxic demographic composed of people who are not and will never be customers, at the cost of mutilating oneself. Because it's exactly the kind of people whom will erase a library for the use of an emote, like a mad dog.</div></div><hr />

You'll forget about things like information control, third world working conditions, carbon footprint and data gathering when the company decides to ban mean words, give you a multiple-selection combo box for gender and start shutting down the people you disagree with.<br />

I hardly ever chat on twitch as I almost never watch stuff on twitch. But I do watch the AGDQ and SGDQ marathons at least a little bit each year. A few years back I got autobanned from the chat because I had a sentence that included the word &quot;triggered&quot; in it. Yes, I get that it's a word that people use to say something reminds them of some hurtful event in the past... but it's also a REAL WORD THAT PEOPLE USE. What pops up on your screen when someone runs over your trap when you're playing Junkrat? &quot;Triggered!&quot; Time to autoban the game of Overwatch from twitch. To possibly lose my 14+ year old accounts because some stupid auto-ban word comes up in casual conversation is frightening.<br />
<br />
I'm sure many people don't remember, but the word &quot;grapes&quot; was auto-censored on the WoW forums for a while because it includes a &quot;bad word&quot; inside it. Censorship is always bad, but automatic censorship is deplorable, especially when it leads to false positives.</div></div><hr />

Thats not even what i meant lol, this whole post reeks about starting to monetize streams in the future and gathering even more data on player behaviour with account linking. ppl that support monetizing in such ways are usually on the rightwing of the political spectrum (atleast here where i live), but not extreme right or extreme left, but i wasn't even talking about extreme left or right.

I think its being blown well out the water. High chance this is just for promotion reasons like they have done in the past with WoW and PVP. They want to get people watching, a good way to do that is to give the player something for tuning in. In order to give the player something they need to know they play the game and the account they are playing on! Would be cool to see different rewards based on time spent in the stream and contributions to the chat. :) <br />
<br />
They can't just go and ban you in game for saying something outside of the game that would be overreaching by a fairly large amount. Even if they were intending to do that you would see the ToS updated in all the Blizzard games you play to reflect that's what will happen.</div></div><hr />

Bollocks. Just don't be a douche in chat and this change will literally not effect you. I'd rather go into a chat with only 10 people talking properly than 1000 people spamming fucking emotes and shitty jokes that have been repeated 1000 times already.<br />

Blizzard want sensible chat alongside their events, I don't see an issue with that. If you reckon your Bnet account is at risk then the problem is with your behaviour, not the change Blizzard is making.<br />

And before anyone goes &quot;oh what about rogue mods banning people&quot;, Blizzard are a multi billion dollar company, you really think they'd not address that and let their reputation be destroyed by one power hungry low level employee?<br />

Blizzard hasn't really shown a lot of control in the past over what they're willing to bitch about. People aren't worried about getting banned over something ban worthy, they're worried about a &quot;Blizzard ban&quot;, like the pepe debacle.</div></div><hr />

its just an internet thing, ppl talking and shitting all over topics they have very little knowledge on. but yes, if the last couple of years are an indication of anything, its that this is a much bigger problem than at first thought. turns out not everyone can speak on everything equally, shocking, i know. if enough people shouting nonsense sound the same they get strenth in numbers and it can create the illusion of relevancy, even if what they say is not a fact, not correct and is just pure bullshit.<br />
<br />
on topic, yes its kinda shitty of blizz to do this but given that it is their platform which gives you teh ability to post on it they can do wahtever they want and not really affect free speach, they are not prohibiting you to do whatever teh fuck you want on a platform of your own ... or any other for that matter</div></div><hr />

We’re always testing out new ways to improve the viewer experience for the Overwatch Path to Pro ecosystem. As part of this, Contenders is trialing a new chat moderation program that requires users who wish to participate in Twitch chat to link their Blizzard Battle.net and Twitch accounts.<br />
<br />
The program will be trialed during 2018 Season 3 quarterfinals matches across all regions, from Dec. 28, 2018, through Jan. 12, 2019. The Path to Pro team then will evaluate the program’s overall effect on creating a more positive viewing experience.<br />
<br />
To link your Battle.net and Twitch accounts, log into Twitch, visit https://www.twitch.tv/settings/connections, and select the “Connect” option under Blizzard Battle.net. Users who try to chat with unlinked accounts will be met with an automatic reply and prompted to link their accounts.<br />
<br />
Follow the official Contenders Twitch channel (https://www.twitch.tv/overwatchcontenders), and watch the official Path to Pro Twitter (https://twitter.com/owpathtopro/) for more updates.<br />
<br />
Great... lets put a group of perpetually offended pussies... I mean.. millenials in charge of chat moderation.... this will end well....</div></div><hr />

This isn't a social matter, it's a political matter. The left/right stems from &quot;left wing politics&quot; and &quot;right wing politics&quot;. There is &quot;right wing populism&quot; and &quot;left wing populism&quot; which are both political ideologies derived from right and left wing political rhetoric. <br />

You clearly haven't been paying to attention to how Patreon, Twitch and Blizzard have been behaving recently. Most specifically Patreon. Your ENTIRE online presence (your &quot;brand&quot;) will be up for evaluation and you will be punished accordingly.

Why is every comment about spewing &quot;racism&quot;. Not all bannable comments are racist. This also sets a precedent that Blizzard can ban anyone and their game accounts for being critical of Blizzard during a stream, for using an emote or a meme. It doesn't have to be racist, it can be anything Blizzard deems. That's the whole point...</div></div><hr />

I would be willing to bet that this is being pushed by the sponsors more than anything given some of the issues Riot Games has had with the chat. LCS chat has been historically vile and Overwatch games can be pretty bad themselves at times. Linking them allows for data collection and better moderation of chat to try to make the chat a more interesting and appealing addition to watching the games live.<br />

Not all bannable comments are racist. This also sets a precedent that Blizzard can ban anyone and their game accounts for being critical of Blizzard during a stream, for using an emote or a meme. It doesn't have to be racist, it can be anything Blizzard deems. That's the whole point...<br />
<br />
Lets talk about realistic things, I've played wow since vanilla launch and have never seen them ban people who are critical of them except maybe in cases where its becoming just degenerate bashing and a witchhunt against a specific person at the company that provides no real discourse other then somehoe bashing them and their family and wishing harm.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard, much like Nintendo, has no reason to allow people to stream their game on Twitch anyway. If you don't support their product why should you be able to comment about it?<br />
However, if it becomes the point where you need to have an account with Blizzard to access third-party content, Blizzard needs to provide their own service instead of freeloading on an open platform. (Oh wait Twitch isn't actually an open platform. Disregard.)<br />
<br />
Email Account. Blizzard Account. Twitch Account. Mobile Phone. Account with Mobile Phone service.--Too many hoops and hurdles. Blizzard is just freeloading while at the same time demanding others to kneel. But also Twitch is freeloading on a concept while hypocritically demanding people to kneel. So its a lose-lose.</div></div><hr />

No its not rofl. You're not giving away your real name. Your twitch account isn't giving away your real name. Your twitch account isn't even giving away your b.net account to other viewers. Its a behind-the-scenes requirement on the insane toxicity of unfiltered twitch chat. Its exactly the same as requiring a subscription to the channel in order to chat, but it costs nothing except maybe 10 minutes of time to make an account if you dont already have one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all the complete ability Blizzard is going to have to censor whatever they want (tell me where historically this was ever a good thing.) And for the people saying they have been &quot;playing since vanilla and Blizzard has never censored anyone&quot;, keep in mind until recently everyone loved Blizzard and they were a &quot;could do no wrong&quot; company. Now this censorfest when there is all this negative sentiment and Blizzard bashing going on....coincidence?...I think not.<br />
<br />
Secondly,do they only want people who play Overwatch to watch Overwatch? If your someone who doesn't have a Blizzard account, are you just locked out of being able to chat. No matter how you feel about Blizzard, I really can't see how anyone can defend this garbage. It's setting an extremely disturbing precedent. <br />
<br />
And for the people who are saying, &quot;Racist comments blah blah, rape comments blah blah&quot;. Can you not just blacklist words on the twitch stream? Can you not just ban the person on the twitch stream? There will still be comments even with B.net accounts. People are just using this to try and whiteknight this straight up scummy move.</div></div><hr />

I would be willing to bet that this is being pushed by the sponsors more than anything given some of the issues Riot Games has had with the chat. LCS chat has been historically vile and Overwatch games can be pretty bad themselves at times. Linking them allows for data collection and better moderation of chat to try to make the chat a more interesting and appealing addition to watching the games live.<br />
<br />
It's amazing. The people trying to make this out to be &quot;evil librulz censoring mah speech&quot; are against the free market and companies deciding what to do with their own platforms.<br />

The problem with your argument is that 12 year olds today still act like this. So should their games be taken away by the companies after their parents have bought them said games? This is getting absurd that you have to do less and less to break the rules it seems.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure it was done in a completely respectable manner without cursing, threatening, or breaking the forum rules or TOS. Yup.<br />
<br />
Here's the secret that apparently a lot of you don't understand:<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't give a shit if you hate them or their game. The rage clicks from youtubers or influencers who does helps them in the end. The only time they actually take action against people is if they're actively cheating in one of their games, breaking the clearly established rules, or threatening developers. <br />
<br />
I spent all of WoD and Legion shit talking the game and they flew me and some others out to their HQ in Anaheim and then gave me a free media pass to Blizzcon, both in 2017. All expenses paid. <br />

If I faced any consequence whatsoever I would have learned earlier dude, that's my entire point. I faced no consequence, I just grew up normally. And, honestly, later than I should have. Because I grew up in the wild west era of the internet. It wasn't acceptable when I was doing it, and it isn't acceptable when the 30 year old edgelords are doing it now. And pretending this system of moderation is somehow some assault on the freedom of speech is laughable on its face.<br />
<br />
And yes, I do know a lot of them are 25+ year olds. I can look at the army of tryhard youtubers and their followers losing their shit right now alone, not to mention the people on 4chan going nuts over it. And they're all grown ass adults.<br />

<br />
I applaud this however. The internet is a cesspool where people are turned into assholes, because there just isn't the social corrective feedback that there is in real life. The internet is new, so our parents certainly weren't able to raise us to behave online. People often fail to realise that acting like a dickbag online has consequences on your personality, in real life as well.<br />
<br />
&quot;Freedom of speech&quot; means you won't be jailed for being critical of those in charge. It does not mean &quot;freedom from consequences&quot; for being an asshole. Nor does it mean a company has no right to decide they do not wish to interact with you.<br />
<br />
In the end, Blizzard is a company, and they get to decide how interaction with their customers goes. This loss of anonymity isn't the norm right now, so it'll probably cost them some customers. It takes balls for em to go &quot;Worth it, if the customers we lose were abusive&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm leftist. I strongly oppose government oversight and limits to freedom of speech on the internet. But if a company wants to enforce conservative values in the service they offer, I support their freedom to do so. <br />

It's not hard to avoid being banned, same way it's not hard to avoid ending up in jail in real life. If you can't do it, then I'd rather be without you anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackfoot</div><div class="date">2018-12-29, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This has sinister implications. At face value it looks like Blizzard is just trying to have you link your Bnet to Twitch and then use this to help police up their Overwatch Chat. While the butt hurt feelings crowd I am sure is cheering for this because all they do is spam emotes like autistic toddlers. The people who choose to speak their minds and say anything negative about Overwatch wether accurate or not doesn't matter. The fact that Blizzards chat mods can now ban you and remove your opinions from their chat has always been possible with existing tools. But now they are holding your Bnet account over your head as well. Say &quot;Overwatch SUCKS!!!&quot; enough times and you might could find yourself banned from talking over Bnet or possibly being removed from Bnet completely and thus losing your games library. If you think that's impossible. Then you really haven't been paying attention lately to how Blizzard and other companies have been dealing with criticism of their products lately. Down vote our reveal trailer for Diablo Immortal? No worries, we will abuse YouTube policies and either request the down votes be removed because of &quot;bots spam&quot;. Or they will just take it down and re-up load it again thus resetting the vote counter to look less honest. If you criticize their games because of cyber woman's running around in WW2, or call them out for re-writing history and making things that really happened in history instead now reflect modern inclusive ideals. EA and Dice apparently don't like the facts of what happened in WW2. So they took it upon themselves to re-write events to portray women replacing commandos who actually did a covert mission against the Nazi's and many of them died to make it a success. Or there's the one where they made it look like WW2 was 1800's in the South and slavery had just ended. They tried to make the French look like massive ass holes to the South Africans who had come over to aid them during WW2. Yet if the French were really this bad. How come so many former slaves left the US and immigrated to France? How come France has a reputation for being open minded about blacks when other nations were still much further behind in this department? Yet EA and Dice just had to create drama where none is to be found. Blizzard is being taken over by Activision. Its obvious if you only opened your eyes and ears and less of your mouths. A great number of the people who made Blizzard so beloved have been leaving but its becoming a flood in 2018. Its because Activision is taking over creative and social control away from Blizzard. I honestly feel sad for the people who are cheering this nonsense and thinking YEAH this furthers my cause! But what you are really saying is &quot;Yes big gaming company! Please feel free to police peoples words. Including mine in the future when my opinion will change and I want to voice displeasure for a product&quot;. Yet by that time you won't be able to do that because you cheered to encourage them to ban all words and phrases &quot;THEY&quot; deem non conducive to their image or profits. So yeah go ahead and link your BNETS and shout how this is all really great and its just gonna clean up Twitch chat and such. Just don't come out later on crying because you can't voice any opinion that isn't completely positive later on. <br />
By the way. Incase anyone is curious. Go to your Twitch settings and under CONNECTIONS is where you can remove your BNET from Twitch.</div></div><hr />

More along the lines of the sponsors having enough of the crap. Twitch chat has been a giant cesspool for awhile and giving problems to other companies like Riot Games who have had the most popular esports on the platform for years. Overwatch is wanting to overtake that, there's big money sponsors involved, and a key selling point to esports is the platform that also allows communication with other viewers during the game. The OWL chat has been pretty damn bad, not LCS bad, but pretty bad and it's entirely likely that they're looking into ways to curb it more efficiently than playing whack a mole with burner accounts. This is a test run before pulling it out for the larger viewerbase.<br />

Yup Twitch is starting to crack down on the streamers themselves for the ongoings in the chat if there's not at least reasonable attempts to moderate. This is an extension of that because sponsors are getting pissed and have been getting pissed about it for awhile.</div></div><hr />

What ever helps ya sleep bro. Blizz already moderates their chat with banned terms and words. Like Autism, Teeth, vulgar racial slurs, derogatory terms for various protected peoples.<br />

You have no idea how fair use works and I doubt many on this website even have remedial knowledge of it. Barely anything Youtube or Twitch does is protected by fair use. Barely anything on the internet alone is protected under fair use outside non-commercial use, and since you access the internet through a commercial ISP nothing is implicitly non-commercial. They (including this very website) have a legal handwave that protects them from what their userbase does (aka frivolous lawsuits). Well, protects them until someone with enough money convinces a judge.<br />
<br />
Just about the only thing protecting users from being sued for any minor copyright/patent infringement over the internet is that a judge recently ruled IP cannot be used as evidence.<br />
<br />
Even my shitty low-effort avatar could be copyright striked (or cease-and-desisted) if the holder cared enough, and since this website is partnered with an advertisement network (Curse) its implicitly a commercial website and they'd have to oblige and force me to change it.<br />
<br />
Its all mutually accepted, borderline illicit, double standards. Don't poke the bull and you won't get the horn--or don't and still get the horn because the bull felt like it.</div></div><hr />

Ok lets just say for a moment that this all starts off as just another &quot;protect the SJW's ploy&quot;. So Blizzard does decide to ban people for comments and such that they deem inappropriate. Exactly what is there to keep them from banning comments that are legit complaints? What is to stop them from banning you from talking in their games for things you have said in Twitch. All they have to say is that because both mediums are tied together then they should share the same punishments. So you log in one day and Blizzard nerfs your favorite character. I mean just guts this class completely. And now you are left with a damn near useless character. So you log onto Twitch during a Dev interview and throw out: Fix X class! WTF!, Or stop nerfing my class! And you get ignored completely. Infact Blizzard just completely ignores the issue across multiple medias. Something they have done before btw. Now you are pissed and you just want your class to work correctly. So the next Dev interview you just say: Fix X class! Please stop fucking X class over. BOOM! Some inclusive and over eager Blizzard drone flags you in Twitch. Now you can't say anything in Twitch. What ever right? Its just Twitch Pshhhh. So you log into WoW and start to get ready for raid. And one of your friends whispers you over BNET. You reply back...….wait nothing happens. You try to reply again......still nothing. Then DING! you get a alert over BNET. You check it and find out you have been globally muted for 2 days because of what you said on their Twitch channel.<br />

My point was that both parties are part of the problem and the &quot;normal&quot; people get caught inbetween. The fact that I have to say &quot;normal&quot; goes to show just how much the situation deteriorated. Nobody should be having to tell sensible humans what's right and what's wrong. <br />

Regardless of all of this, Blizzard shows that they have no clue what the majority of gamers are like and what the gaming community actively supports or is against. The typical gamer prototype is protective of the freedoms the internet provides.</div></div><hr />

How so? Left is all about policing thoughts these days.<br />
<br />
All of the narrow focused people on this post talking about left and right politics not realizing that this is 100% because of China's new rules on &quot;Harmonious chat&quot;. I mean seriously, lol. people think this has anything to do with SJW? Or the internet &quot;Woke&quot; weird and whacko hate for anything left? Sorry, no. It's entirely because of China. Which is a religious authoritarian government system that is putting muslims in re-education cramps and wants everything monitored so you don't talk bad about the country. Kthanks.<br />

<br />
The issue with anything American these days is that freedom of speech is mistaken to be an abdication of common sense of respectful behaviour by those considered &quot;the right&quot;, while the SJW's take common sense to such an extreme that it becomes irrational, aggressive hive-minding, forcing the definition of common sense to slowly cave unto itself and turn into deobjectivized subjective takes on reality.<br />
<br />
Freedom of speech is not about being an asshole, but common sense isn't about censoring anything someone finds subjectively offensive either. Especially not if it involves the levels of ridiculousness we see nowadays. Blizzard fell for the trap of what's &quot;trending&quot; and there's no going back now.<br />
<br />
Not to go off topic, but freedom of speech only applies to public places, and the more people start to realize that the less I need to read hate about progressives pushing people out using what the right likes to love, the free market. Privately owned websites, private property, and private companies are not &quot;Free speech&quot; zones. They can ask you to leave. <br />
<br />
But to my original point, this has to do with China, not America.</div></div><hr />

My favorite thing about the internet is white people (and I mean white people, like, peaked in highschool then went to college for the frat party white people) that amass followers by &quot;Destroying&quot; strawman leftist scenarios by bitching about it in-front of a camera, the most of which are fake and created by similar people on 4-chan to troll said white people. <br />

Your right, the game company that recently deleted terribly received launch video in order to reset the like to dislike ratio, who has been deleting peoples legitimate criticisms on the same video when they finally gave up re-uploading it to do said re-uploading can totally be trusted to be completely fair in their moderation right? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I mean it's not as if they recently announced the removal of an entire games e-sports division after assuring the people involved that it wouldn't do any such thing given peoples livelihoods were at stake? They would never use these new powers to shut down any more criticisms right? :rolleyes: <br />

<br />
This is down to America, not China. Even if all the censoring in the gaming world happened because of China, it is an American company that wants to push into the Chinese market and nobody else but said company chose to do so. That said, they can simply not broadcast in China, but they are not doing that, which in the end means that an American company willingly bends over to the Chinese censorship laws for the sake of more views. Bottom line, proof that this isn't down to China is all over the place because the same trends are evident in American-run things too, regardless whether it is cable TV, TV shows, Hollywood, games with a dominant American playerbase and so on.<br />
<br />
This is however beyond the point because the enforcement of mandatory, deobjectivized progressive speech that catters to subjective perception of fragile individuals is an entirely American thing (this in turn leads to the need to have software/staff that holds a stick and &quot;beats&quot; anyone who steps out of what is percieved as &quot;the red line&quot; on the internet, with the bar being pushed lower and lower). Another issue about America is that anything bad that comes out of its own system is attributed to &quot;bad stuff from the outside&quot; (ie Russia, China) and it feels almost as if certain Americans either can't comprehend or are in complete denial that these issues are innately tied to the fabric of American society. <br />
<br />
<br />
tl;dr The gaming and internet community is in the crosshairs of all of this and most importantly, gamers are quite frankly annoyed that their medium of fun is being subjected to the same scrutiny and standards as other mediums in real life are, regardless whether this is down to censorship laws of foreign governments or domestic interpersonal ecosystems. This is why decisions like these are highly unpopular.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s0ul</div><div class="date">2018-12-30, 12:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is clearly because China started banning games for &quot;inharmonious chatroom&quot; and Overwatch is on the list for corrective action. <br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard is becoming a fucking joke and the people who support this censorship in the name of moderation are just as idiotic. It's basically the Chinese social credit system. And then we have the entitled human garbage that play this game. They refuse to use the ignore and report button, and believe this moderation is somehow going to help the community. All this is going to do is make people even more intolerant of you shitty players.</div></div><hr />

you know just as good as me that this is not whats going on here. Its if you talk shit in the overwatch tournament games. Not if you watch some gamer play dark souls and talk smack or even other overwatch streams from random people. Its the official games only. <br />
<br />
And its probably to make only people with battlenet links able to watch the stream in the first place. Maybe they are charging money for it in the future, who knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is the capitalist free market that is dictating the changes like this. The Chinese system and the American system are not mutually exclusive; they are intervowen. Decision-making in capitalist free markets is dictated by profit and China knows this, which is why it is able to impose various demands, knowing said American company will bend it's behaviour to conform. This way Blizzard gets money and China censors whatever it wants to censor, with both sides being content with eachother. Now if we're talking about the individual buyer within the capitalist market, then we can obviously conclude that this is a simple &quot;take it or leave it&quot; situation for us consumers.<br />
<br />
The Chinese government is definitely totalitarian, though I would have to respectfully disagree on the assessment that it is religious. China has been hard at work to marginalize religion and belief as a whole, as goes with any country run by a communist party, regardless whether it is authoritatian or purely etatistic (China being a bit of both).</div></div><hr />
