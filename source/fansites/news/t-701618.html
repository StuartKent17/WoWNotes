Patch 3.3.3 Battlegrounds and Honor Changes<br />
Patch 3.3.3 brings a couple of changes to the Battleground system, the new system is heavily inspired from the current random dungeon system and it should be pretty easy to understand. <br />
<br />
Random Battleground and Call to Arms<br />
Call to Arms are no longer a quests and are directly integrated to the battlegrounds interface, a new &quot;Random Battleground&quot; option has been added and give you the same honor bonus as the Call To Arms, but applied to any battleground. <br />
<br />
The first time you win a Call to Arms or a Random Battleground, you gain 30 Honorable Kills worth of bonus honor and 25 Arena points.<br />
Losing the battleground doesn't remove the ability to get this bonus, you can just try again.<br />
After you won a Random Battleground or a Call To Arms for the first time of the day, the bonus is lowered to 15 Honorable Kills worth of bonus honor.<br />
You can only get the 30 HK bonus honor for a Call to Arms or a Random Battleground once in a day, the bonuses aren't &quot;stackable&quot; and both are lowered to 15 HK. (See screenshot) <br />
<br />

<br />
Honor Prices Changes / Battleground Marks Removal<br />
All the battleground marks are being removed from the game. <br />
<br />
Players will be able to exchange all their marks (AV (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/20560/alterac-valley-mark-of-honor/), AB (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/20559/arathi-basin-mark-of-honor/), EoTS (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/29024/eye-of-the-storm-mark-of-honor/), IQ (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/47395/isle-of-conquest-mark-of-honor/), SoTA (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/42425/strand-of-the-ancients-mark-of-honor/), WG (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/20558/warsong-gulch-mark-of-honor/)) for Commendation of Service (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54637/commendation-of-service/). Each Commendation of Service (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54637/commendation-of-service/) costs 1 mark and rewards you with 185 Honor.<br />
All the items bought with marks had their price changed and can now be bought with honor only.<br />
If you're interested in the old PvP rewards (some of them looked pretty nice), their price was also changed and it will be much easier to get them. Expect to spend 25,000 honor for a 2H weapon and 13,000 for a 1H. A full pre-BC epic PvP set will cost you 74,000 Honor. <br />
<br />
Of course some of the price changes are more interesting than the others, for example you don't have to farm marks anymore to get your PvP mounts and you can just buy them for 50,000 Honor. <br />
<br />

&lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Just as a reminder, this is the PvP part of the Patch 3.3.3 PTR Notes (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=23329393385&amp;sid=1), just in case you want to hear it from the blues. <br />
<br />
PvP<br />
The amount of Honor awarded for an Honorable Kill has been increased by 100% for characters of all levels. This change will effectively double the amount of Honor received from Honorable Kills, or for completing Battleground and Wintergrasp objectives; however, the amount of experience gained from completing Battleground objectives and the amount of Honor rewarded for completing each Wintergrasp quest remain unchanged.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; The Random Battleground system has been added! Similar to the Random Dungeon system in the Dungeon Finder, players can now queue for a random Battleground.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; The Random Battleground option can be found in the Battleground tab of the PvP frame and is only available for level 80 characters at this time.&#13; If this option is selected, players may not queue for specific Battlegrounds and a random Battleground simultaneously.&#13; Similar to the Random Dungeon system, players will not know for which Battleground they are chosen when selected from the queue until they zone into the Battleground.&#13; The Random Battleground option will only allow a group size of 5 players to queue together.&#13; Bonus rewards will be offered for choosing the Random Battleground option.&#13; Winning a Battleground using the Random Battleground option for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency and 25 Arena points.&#13; Winning additional Battlegrounds using the Random Battleground option after the first random win will award players with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; Losing a Battleground using the Random Battleground option will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13;[/list]&#13; Daily Battleground quests have been removed in place of the Random Battleground option.&#13; Battlegrounds will no longer award Marks of Honor.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; Players with existing Marks of Honor can still turn them in to their respective faction's quest givers, including individual marks for those who may have more marks for one Battleground than another.&#13; Items which previously required Marks of Honor will have their costs adjusted to remove these requirements.&#13;[/list]&#13; Whenever a Battleground has the holiday bonus active, it will now be referred to as &quot;Call to Arms&quot; in the Battleground tab and Calendar. In addition, Call to Arms Battleground Honor rewards have been changed.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; Choosing a specific Battleground with the Call to Arms bonus active will yield the exact same rewards as when choosing the Random Battleground option.&#13;&lt;ul&gt;&#13; Winning a Call to Arms Battleground for the first time in a day will award players with 30 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency and 25 Arena points.&#13; Additional Call to Arms Battleground victories after the first win for a player that day will award them with 15 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; Losing a Call to Arms Battleground will award players with 5 Honorable Kills worth of additional Honor currency.&#13; When using the Random Battleground option, players will not receive additional rewards if the Battleground chosen is under the Call to Arms bonuses. In addition, the rewards for the first victory of the day cannot be earned more than once, regardless of whether or not it is obtained from the Random Battleground system or the Call to Arms Battleground.&#13;[/list]&#13;[/list]&#13;[/list]<br />

Mobile Authenticator Warning Message<br />
After installing the most recent Battle.net Mobile Authenticator iPhone/iPod touch update (v1.1.0), all players will be prompted with a one-time warning that states:<br />
Running a “jailbroken” iPhone OS device may compromise the security of the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator.<br />
<br />
This warning message is being issued by Blizzard Entertainment as a reminder that running the Battle.net Mobile Authenticator on a “jailbroken” iPhone or iPod touch could potentially compromise the security of the Mobile Authenticator application. If your iPhone or iPod touch has not been “jailbroken” or modified to bypass software restrictions, please click “OK” and you will no longer receive the warning.<br />
<br />
Please note that this message will appear on all iPhone &amp; iPod touch devices and is not meant to indicate that your Apple device has been modified. <br />
<br />
Dodge and Parry<br />
I think the way you end up with conclusions like this is by following a chain of logic such as:<br />
<br />
1) I am a tank. It is my job to survive (among other things).<br />
2) It makes it easier to survive if I avoid spike damage and otherwise make it easier on my healers.<br />
3) I can avoid spike damage by emphasizing health and armor over avoidance.<br />
4) Therefore I should look for health and armor wherever possible.<br />
5) Since I don't really want avoidance, Blizzard should stop putting it on my gear or even in the game.<br />
<br />
That last step is where you go astray. You make a leap from thinking like a player (&quot;How can I survive better?&quot;) to designing like a player (&quot;I can survive better if Blizzard changes the game to make it easier for me to survive better&quot;).<br />
<br />
You'd be bored if there was no avoidance mechanic in combat. Bosses would hit you like a metronome for say 30K every swing. You'd be bored if there was no avoidance on gear because you'd only be choosing among say hit and expertise and maybe armor pen.<br />
<br />
Random numbers are an important component for keeping the game exciting. I get that they can be a thorn in your side. That's largely why they are exciting. Without them, you'd be a better tank, but you'd also be a bored tank.<br />
<br />
What we can do, and what we plan on doing, are making dodge, parry and block more attractive than they are today. I doubt they will ever be as attractive as armor and Stamina, but that's okay because we're never going to make a full set of gear that is just armor and Stamina. (And even if you assembled such a set, your healers would run out of mana trying to keep you up.) <br />
<br />
Relics and &quot;useless&quot; procs<br />
We actually don't like procs that are up 100% of the time and in 3.3.3 we changed several of the group buffs to just be passives.<br />
<br />
Sometimes the mechanic is necessary so that a damage rotation requires some ramp-up instead of just being at 100% from the first swing. So we can't get rid of every single case.<br />
<br />
The idols (and all similar pieces) are in a weird spot. Once upon a time they used to change your rotation ad little bit in order to maximize the bonus, but these days they are really balanced around being up 100% of the time and if we end up putting the proc on a spell or ability that isn't used often, well then the idol just sucks for that tier.<br />
<br />
We're not sure yet what we're going to do with these items. The current implementation doesn't feel that successful. They could just be stat sticks not tied to a particular ability, though that's not super exciting either.

<br />
However with the random option maybe we will be earning honor faster than we otherwise would. Also, some of the 90 marks were from BGs that my battlegroup struggled to win. Those 30 marks might as well be 30 loses. <br />
<br />
Hopefully we will be earning 50k honor faster than we could otherwise earn 90 marks.<br />
<br />
Also when it comes to opportunity cost, we could be using that 50k honor to buy epic gems. If we say an epic gem is worth 200g and 5 epic gems = 1 mount then a PVP mount costs 1,000g. That is cheap compared to some of the other vender mounts for sell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 13g multiplied by the number of days it takes you to farm 50k honor should also be factored in to the cost of these PVP mounts, making them more expensive than I first thought.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">wadark</div><div class="date">2010-03-14, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mounts are a concern for me as well. For, as Crusoe said, 90 marks now is one mount, but after the patch, those marks are only worth about 30% or so of the cost of the mount. So at first blush it might seem more practical to farm the marks before the patch hits.<br />
<br />
The problem with this line of thought, though, is that there are two major factors that factor in to this situation.<br />
<br />
1. Struggling to Win.<br />
Some battlegroups struggle to win certain BGs (or all of them). So given the amount of time it takes to earn 30 marks pre-patch, it may be much faster to farm the same amount of honor somewhere else post-patch. Which leads me to...<br />

2. No Specifics.<br />
The 90 marks that mounts cost now are specific to a few battlegrounds, which means you HAVE to run THOSE BGs to get the mounts. Post-patch, the 50k honor can come from anywhere. Mark turn-ins, HKs, random/CtA BGs, WG weeklys, etc. So even though the marks themselves are worth far less than they are now, you have to account for the fact that you have MANY new sources through which to earn the mounts.<br />
<br />
Conculsion:<br />
Post-patch will see these mounts become a lot easier to find.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wondering, if you lose the first random or call, does the +honor and arena points disappear? I hope not....<br />
<br />
<br />
No, those rewards only go away after your first win. Think of it like running your first Random Heroic, but the group falls apart after the first boss. You can join a new one and still get your two Frost Emblems...same concept here.</div></div><hr />

I did the same math. On paper that's a terrible trade-off and one I wasn't expecting given blizz's comments that it would be easier to accrue things. Even g iven the greater options for getting honor and the lack of bg specificity I was figuring figuring something closer to 200 honor per.<br />

Yes, Also note the big elephant in the room when people whine &quot;they cost a lot more!&quot;: You can do what ever you want. World PVP, Wintergrasp, any single BG working on rep/achievements, or spread them out and do something each. Hell go raid Southshore/Tarren Mill if it gets you going. If seems if you do and win one BG a day you can get a mount in under a month, shorter if you do Call to Arms and win daily. Not counting losses or honor earned actually playing it (remember, HKs give a lot more honor now).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before:<br />
3 Marks win<br />
1 Mark defeat<br />
If we take a 50% chance to win (not always true, but will do for calculation purposes):<br />
Average marks for a BG: 2<br />
BGs needed to get 90 marks: 45<br />
<br />
Now:<br />
1862 honor normal wins, 3723(double) first random and first call to arms wins<br />
621 honor defeats<br />
With the same 50% chance<br />
Average honor for a BG: 1241.5<br />
BGs needed to get 50000 honor: 40.27<br />
First random and first call to arms count double, so if they are 1 in 5 bgs you do, you end up with a number closer to 32 BGs for a mount.<br />
<br />
I'd say 32 BGs for an epic mount is 71.6% of the work it took before, so I'll say it's a win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering kills themselves are now doubled in terms of honor gained and objectives still exist alongside the ability to turn in Stonekeeper shards (30 Shards is 2k Honor, or 66.66~ per Shard, almost every dungeon has at least 3 bosses for 800 Honor per dungeon), the mounts, and equipment in general, are probably equally accessible for those who were a PvP oriented faction in a battlegroup. For those of us who are not, the mounts are absurdly more accessible even at a steep cost of 50k Honor.</div></div><hr />

There's no way farming your mounts is &quot;profitable&quot;, that doesn't make any sense at all.<br />

Is the thought of more honor for an honorable kill, and random battleground rewards too much for your puny mind to comprehend? Maybe you should learn to understand the patch notes before speaking. I'm glad you found a way to profit from PvP mounts though, I don't think anyone else has. Also, it's*</div></div><hr />

I think the idea is to encourage people to just run random. You can still select individual heroics but you don't get two bonus badges. They want as many people in the random pool as possible so the queues go fast, if they didn't reward random people would just run AB/WSG/AV and their other three BGs would remain dead during off peak hours. (At least on my battlegroup)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taking the time to farm 30 marks from AV,AB,WSG takes much longer than grinding out 50k honor. And you don't even have to suffer through the ones you hate. As alliance you can just plop your butt in AV all day for win after win then bam you get a mount.</div></div><hr />

Is it possible to get a clarification and/or confirmation on this one?

I would LOVE if that was true. The only way to get them now (If you've taken the time to farm the research tokens) is to get a friend of opposite faction to agree to exchange kills for battle tokens. Technically this is frowned upon by Blizzard, or so I hear, but the fact of the matter is that Halaa is a ghost town. Heck, it became a ghost town before Wrath even came out. =P <br />
<br />
As for the price of the PvP mounts, I'm pretty disappointed. I really dislike PvP. Heck, I haven't accrued 50k honor points in the years that I've been playing WoW. But I AM a mount collector... Those PvP mounts have been taunting me for years, combining something I love with something I hate... I was hoping the battleground marks would exchange for more. At LEAST 250 honor each. Or that the mounts would be a bit cheaper than that. I suppose honor will be easier to come by, and I'll be able to do some of the newer BGs rather than groaning at the prospect of farming WSG 30 times per mount, but I can't help but feel a bit disappointed, despite this logic. <br />
<br />
I'll keep my fingers crossed that they'll reveal the Celestial Steed as the next mount achievement reward. I'd gleefully farm PvP mounts to work towards that one. ;)<br />

Lets say Patch 3.3.3 is out and its a Tuesday, 20k honor minimium from WG with the stone keepers shards included, 3723 honor for just winning a random, and 1862 for winning any after the first; all this honor becomes easy to rack up 50k.

<br />
the marks were cool, but we all know that certain battlegroups get raped in certain gametypes. On mine, alliance side lost the vast majority of Eots and WG, while winning a larger percentage of AV's and AB's. The IoC's and SotA's were pretty much even.<br />
<br />
Now as far as marks go, having to play 25ish games of Eots/wg's just because alliance on my battlegroup suck at it isnt fair. This way, the players actually playing well and getting stuck in will be rewarded better for their efforts. Dont get me wrong, im not anywhere near amazing at pvp (at least on my main lol) but it isnt fair when i see 1 person on my team who's a wrecking ball and running around doing all the work like superman, who then has to play 30 WG's because his team constantly mess up and let him down. <br />
<br />
The new system sounds much better to me. Its a shame to see the marks go, but im sure the honor point system revamp and any new things blizz think of will do a good job of replacing them.<br />
<br />
I think the new system will make the mounts alot less hassle to get. One on hand it might mean 'doing' more, but on the other you dont have to keep on repeating BG's that you hate and your team fail at miserably. I love IoC, so its cool that i can play that 10-15 times in a row if i want and still be chipping away towards the pvp mounts. :)</div></div><hr />

Some of us have a couple of hundred marks spread over 3BGs because we don't like a certain battleground or 2. When 3.3.3 goes live we'll have to buy 10, use them with their GCD, buy 10 more etc. It's a nice change so we can get something for our old marks but this does seem like a boring hour long button mash. They could add a 1850 token for 10 marks without the unique limit so we can buy them and get away from what is obviously going to be a humped vendor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While a raise in cap might be nice, this is not your problem. Your problem is bad judgement -- you can easily spend your honor in gems down to say 50k or lower every day and run yourself back up toward the cap with a lot less chance of passing the cap on a BG win. Your only risk is caused by not spending enough.... you get nothing from staying within 5k of cap each day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However with the random option maybe we will be earning honor faster than we otherwise would. Also, some of the 90 marks were from BGs that my battlegroup struggled to win. Those 30 marks might as well be 30 loses. <br />
<br />
Hopefully we will be earning 50k honor faster than we could otherwise earn 90 marks.<br />
<br />
Also when it comes to opportunity cost, we could be using that 50k honor to buy epic gems. If we say an epic gem is worth 200g and 5 epic gems = 1 mount then a PVP mount costs 1,000g. That is cheap compared to some of the other vender mounts for sell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Depends on your battlegroup. On Ruin, you can lolwut your way to 15K honor for 20 minutes a week in WG and in that same span not come near enough WSG marks for 1 mount. And seeing as we never win AV, you would hope for quick losses and fast queues.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kriziak</div><div class="date">2010-03-15, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't look at marks to calculate the cost of mounts, but to the Battleground rewards.<br />
<br />
Before:<br />
3 Marks win<br />
1 Mark defeat<br />
If we take a 50% chance to win (not always true, but will do for calculation purposes):<br />
Average marks for a BG: 2<br />
BGs needed to get 90 marks: 45<br />
<br />
Now:<br />
1862 honor normal wins, 3723(double) first random and first call to arms wins<br />
621 honor defeats<br />
With the same 50% chance<br />
Average honor for a BG: 1241.5<br />
BGs needed to get 50000 honor: 40.27<br />
First random and first call to arms count double, so if they are 1 in 5 bgs you do, you end up with a number closer to 32 BGs for a mount.<br />
<br />
I'd say 32 BGs for an epic mount is 71.6% of the work it took before, so I'll say it's a win.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
you forgot the honor from BG now :) From those 45 BG (now) you get those 90 mark for mount and another 45k honor....</div></div><hr />

S2 five piece merciless gear sets for honor and BG marks have not been available for over 1 year+. blizz also removed all BC pvp weapons from honor/mark vendors.<br />
<br />
currently S1 and S2 armor is only available at isle of quel'danas for tier armor exchange badges dropped in BC raids. S4 gear/weapons is still in game, but you have to arena at 70 to get those<br />
<br />
reading the comment in starting post to this thread:<br />
<br />
If you're interested in the old PvP rewards (some of them looked pretty nice), their price was also changed and it will be much easier to get them. Expect to spend 25,000 honor for a 2H weapon and 13,000 for a 1H. A full pre-BC epic PvP set will cost you 74,000 Honor. <br />
<br />
<br />
looking at current honor/mark costs of 60 epic gear and how blizz made 90 mark mounts soon to cost 50000 honor. (90 marks that will be exchanged for 16650 honor) i can't see a whole PVP gear/weapons set going for 74000 based on their value judgement what mounts should and will be.. it that what it is on PTR?</div></div><hr />
