<br />
One major complaint was that the garrison mission system enacted like Farmville, where you just popped by and let the followers do all the work. The other major complaint being socially isolated from other players (which is not the case with class halls).<br />
<br />
This was announced in august that you will have &quot;missions&quot; that you do yourself, instead of just clicking a button and wait for 30 mins.<br />
<br />
<br />
I suspect you are smply afraid of the words &quot;garrison&quot; and &quot;mission&quot; in the sentence. I suggest you read into it a little more and wait for further details.<br />
<br />
So far it seems blizzard learned from their mistakes regarding garrisons.</div></div><hr />

It may come from world objectives. The keystone has a power level that determines the difficulty and reward. Higher levels of it will have some additional modifiers. There is now a single timer, roughly around where Silver is now. If you beat the timer, you upgrade your stone and can take on more challenging. If you fail, you lose the stone but still get loot.<br />

May I ask how this is a bad thing? How is it better to have the content relevant for literally 1-2 hours then irrelevant for the next 2 years of the expansion?<br />

It is a bad thing because you do not see an evolution of your character while leveling. Not to mention that it's an incredibly cheap way on skimping on the actual max-level open world content.<br />

I don't know about that, my guess is, the story will still go in a certain order between the zones, even if you will be able to do them in a different order.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I'm saying is that for Blizzcon...the best time for Blizzard to hype their upcoming games...the new stuff for Legion seemed pretty unimpressive. I thought the adventure mode stuff seemed kinda neat, but the idea of running 10 scaling dungeons constantly over the course of an expansion pack doesn't strike me as awesome. It strikes me as something that almost nobody will do after the newness factor wears off (see garrison invasions)<br />
<br />
It was all decent stuff, but nothing that struck me as &quot;OMFG I CANT WAIT FOR LEGIONNNNNN!!!!111111&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the world now have objectives you can complete in any zone for rewards and they swap out all the time so your not always doing the same ones<br />
You have a daily each day to do a few objectives for rep and rewards<br />
If you miss a day then its just like hearthstone and they stack up<br />
<br />
Some objectives last for a hour<br />
Some for a day<br />
Some for a week</div></div><hr />

That's not really new... Weekly quests are a thing. As are dailies. The only new part of that was how some may last a few hours. Doing a few objectives for a daily = tanaan and that was really boring to me. I don't like the whole &quot;fill the bar until completion with mindless tasks&quot; deal.</div></div><hr />

We dont even know how most of the quests will look like<br />
Secondly its more personal choice than ever so its way different since you get to choose most of your objectives for your quest<br />

Some may be world bosses<br />

Well this time its all over the zone not in specific areas like in draenor or tanaan<br />
Secondly its not just apexis zones and pretty much every activity that can we done in the world<br />
Thirdly they change all the time<br />

Nope, that's not what Blizzard actually says in their official recap. I'll repost the quote again:<br />
<br />
<br />
..for the very first time in World of Warcraft’s history, we’ll be putting a full cinematic as a part of the storytelling right within the game.<br />
<br />
I want to know if that means they're including production quality, pre-rendered cinematics (i.e. on par with the cinematic trailers for Blizzard games, or the in-game cinematics in Starcraft and Diablo) in Legion itself.</div></div><hr />

I do not want to do one stupid raid for 4-5 months on 4 level of difficulty and wait for one new raid till patch 7.1 and repeat doing one new raid for 5 months on 4 levels of difficulty.<br />
Not by any chance. I want to have some options like I had in TBC or WotLK where we had at least 3 raids at start ( all opened from the start ) so we could choose...<br />
<br />
And I hope they will give us a new raid and at least 1 - 2 new dungeons each new patch. And pls do 3 major patches not just 2 like in WoD... <br />

<br />
The item squish wasn't just a thing they wanted to do, it was necessary. It's why Garrosh had 3 health bars, not because it was a design decision, but because his health was too high for the engine. <br />
<br />
Besides, it's just numbers. Whether you're doing 1000000000 damage per hit, or 1000, you're still doing X% damage relative to the bosses health, and you are still equally more powerful than you were when you level up now than how it was before the squish. If the fact that your sword only gives you +300 STR rather than 3000 STR but still gives you just as much as a power increase is a decision that makes you want to quit, you should sort out your priorities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More and more MMOs have been doing this by default, since it means they can design events, dailies, world bosses, etc. in every single zone instead of just cramming everyone into a single end game zone. They have more environments to work with plus more space.<br />
<br />
You get &quot;more powerful&quot; by getting better gear.<br />

Not by any chance. I want to have some options like I had in TBC or WotLK where we had at least 3 raids at start ( all opened from the start ) so we could choose...<br />
<br />
And I hope they will give us a new raid and at least 1 - 2 new dungeons each new patch. And pls do 3 major patches not just 2 like in WoD... <br />
<br />
Or Blizz will piss me big time.<br />
<br />
Posts like this are interesting. You know damn well the second raid is going to be gated for a long time. You know damn well there won't be new dungeons later in the expansion. You know damn well there will be another 14 month gap at the end. History tells you this. It's like none of you fucking learn. You'll just keep being in denial and hand them your money then be confused when they do the same shit. You'll be back here saying the exact fucking thing when they announce Wrath of the Lich Queen.</div></div><hr />

Worst part is ofc that this content is 8-10 months away. And the current situation is dire on live servers. STILL these developers have the guts to sit and boast about all the things that they will add ... and NOT A WORD what they can do to improve current live servers.<br />
<br />
Just really sad to see dev team that is TOTALLY out of sync with the game - and ofc they are since they have ZERO connection to the live servers when they start working on next expansions. And Blizzard finds this perfectly acceptable. <br />

Disgrace really.</div></div><hr />

They've already spoken about not annoucing features unless they know they will be in the game after WoD.<br />

First the item-squish, now the scaling zones ... they really want to destroy power-up-feeling and want me to quit WoW :( Why are they doing this?<br />
<br />
Oh I'm sure it's just so that you'll have something to bitch about, they are most certainly out to get you. Or maybe because it's a great feature for anyone who wants a less streamlined and more open experience. Take your pick.<br />

Very much agree that it's disappointing, I've unsubbed and probably won't return until Legion. But it's not a delay when they never specified a date to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Dungeons can replace raiding?? Wtf?!?<br />

Scaling for everything? Why not just remove levels at this point. Joke.<br />
<br />
Sped up catch up mechanics for weapons? Yea cause having to make a choice and identify with it is just too difficult for the entitled ones so this way they can just have both. Time for a 3rd spec too huh?<br />
<br />
Disgusted with wow. After wod I thought for sure they would make it a bit less patty cake. At 33 with a newborn perhaps it's time to leave it to the kids. Been mmorpging for 20 years (well 10 if u count bc as the end of my mmorpg time as post that was more of a faux mmo or moba with chat)<br />
<br />
At least we are getting closer and closer to pantheon being released.<br />

Flying in an MMO is, imo, completely unnecessary, and does contribute to less immersion (which you yourself state as being important). Having a way to easily transport to places is nice though, and there are plenty of ways to do that WITHOUT flying. Adding a fast travel system (better than the current flight taxi's), would be a good enough change that would also negate most of the reason people want flying in the first place. The rest of the people, the ones who want flying so they can skip past everything and not have to have any sort of interaction with the game world whatsoever, shouldn't be playing an mmo anyway.<br />

Ask yourself why people run raids. Is it because they like the challenge? Is it solely because raids drop the best gear, for PvE? Is it because they enjoy the large-scale combat?<br />
Now ask yourself how any of these things would be ruined by having an alternative form of end game content. I'll answer it for you: they won't.<br />
If you enjoy raiding because it's challenging, you can still enjoy that same challenge in future raids. You will now also have an ADDITIONAL form of challenging content to do, which is a good thing. I'm pretty sure a large portion of the people that raid only log on during their designated raid times, and then aren't on the rest of the week because there's no other form of content where they can push themselves. <br />
If you're solely doing raids for the gear, then whether or not dungeons past a certain difficulty level will drop better gear than a raid would is irrelevant, because you're playing for the gear and not the content (plus I highly doubt they'd do that anyway).<br />
If you enjoy the large scale combat in raids, there's literally no reason you can't still have that. They aren't replacing raids with dungeons. You can just &quot;choose&quot; to do whatever you like now.<br />
<br />
You say they're removing rewards for skillful gameplay, yet they just stated that there are increased rewards for defeating higher difficulty level dungeons. Just like there are increased rewards for defeating higher difficulty raid bosses. Not sure where you see them removing anything.<br />
You say they're removing choice, and then you complain about them giving you the choice of which path you want to take while leveling? They also just stated they were giving people the choice of how they want to complete &quot;dailies&quot;, while also giving them the choice of when to complete said dailies - since the npcs that offer them won't be gone after the day is over, letting you save them for a day of your &quot;choice&quot;.<br />
<br />
I mean, you're literally just complaining about things to complain about them, with no real reason. You also even go so far as to contradict yourself in your attempt to criticize everything.</div></div><hr />

Pretty excited that we won't all be crammed into 1-2 zones at the start, and that you don't have to do certain dungeons at a very specific couple of levels while leveling up.<br />
<br />
Wasn't an issue in BC. Part of the RPG journey in WoW is, while leveling up, gaining access to new things, including higher level zones, with enemies you wouldn't defeat previously. Or seeing the growth of your character by easily dispatcing an enemy that you struggled against just a bit earlier.<br />
<br />
I'm giving a shit to scaling, but I'd rather not see RPG elements scrapped from this game anymore, they barely exist now. Next step is you starting in a lobby room, picking class, picking race, picking activity and jumping into the action. Not a bad system, but hopefully not WoWs.</div></div><hr />

I'm deeply sorry. Does my daily routine, which includes work and social acitivities, in some way negatively affect your convenience when playing World of Warcraft?<br />
<br />
It's time to get real. Hardcore is a thing of the past. People don't want that anymore. We've all been 10-20 at some point during classic WoW. Back then, raiding for a whole night wasn't an issue. But I'm in my mid 20's now. I have a job to do. I have a girlfriend, who is crazy enough to actually want some of my undivided attention for quite some time.<br />
<br />
I'm really sorry that we (as in &quot;the casuals&quot;) are disturbing your MMO experience. That said, we will continue as we always have, without actually giving a single flying f*** about what a hardcore whiner says. You want some challenging experience with great rewards at the end? Try higher education for a change. You'll have something that isn't wasted as soon as the servers go down.<br />
<br />

Ah. Burning Crusade. The expansion where 80% of the raid content was locked behind invisible walls. As someone who partcipated in BT raids back in the day, as fun as it was, I wouldn't want that to be a thing again. Too much time wasted on unnecessary farming and progression.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree with that. Been looking around on all of them - and ofcause there are some ok/cool ones, but overall it was a turnoff. Yeah I know we will get skins for them, and some of them will look great. But the basic weapons are a bit boring to me. Some of the stories about them are ok, just visuel boring.</div></div><hr />
