FinalBoss has an Interview with Ion Hazzikostas &amp; Kris Zeirhut on Sunday. If you would like to suggest any question, place them over in this thread! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1649976-FinalBoss-interview-with-Ion-Hazzikostas-amp-Kris-Zeirhut-on-Sunday)<br />
<br />
Game Systems<br />
<br />
When do we get the new Heirloom system?<br />
We are currently planning to have this system ready for patch 6.1.0.<br />
<br />
Do you tend to concern yourself with economics (other than gold sinks) or simply let the &quot;market&quot; do as it thinks best?<br />
Definitely agree we need more things players can use core gathering materials for. In retrospect, we would have liked for there to have been more crafted items that use those materials without requiring the time-gated resources, so this problem is something we're hoping to address going forward.<br />
<br />
BRING BACK CLASS QUESTS.<br />
For sure - the green fire questline was a great experience. We do want to do more of this in the future, especially in a way that highlights and reinforces class identity, and are actively working on some cool stuff along these lines.<br />
<br />
How well do you think the charge system works for spells, verses the more traditional cooldown, and are you planning on converting any more spells to be charge based?<br />
We're pretty happy with that system. The major advantage of that system is the way it allows for more open-ended decisionmaking in spell use that doesn't penalize a player for not using an ability the instant it comes off cooldown. It also lets you deliberately plan ahead and pool usage. I'm not sure we'd want to extend it to ALL abilities, but for abilities that commonly run into the two issues I just outlined, it can really improve usability without needing to add additional mechanics.<br />
<br />
Can you guys explain the logic behind versatility, given this? It seems to be simple a +betterer stat, and feels neither interesting or fun.<br />
Yeah I'm not sure that we actually accomplished that goal TBH. We're trying to strike a balance between the goal above and also the goal that we have enough variety in items, but I think we wound up with more secondary stats than we really need. This will be something we continue to refine in the future.<br />
<br />
Spirit as a secondary/primary stat. It's super discouraging that we as healers don't have any enchants, gems, or flasks with spirit. The nerfing of that crystal recently you get in the inn was hard hit also. My question is: What is spirit? Secondary stat or Primary stat? Why can't we have it on either gems and enchants or flasks? It should really be treated as one or the other. It just seems unfair as the odd one out, when tanks even get a stam flask to use.<br />
It's your best secondary stat as a healer, similar to what Armor is for tanks. Early on in beta, you actually could get Spirits gems/flasks/food, but we found that it undermined part of the point of consumable philosophy. We removed primary stats from gems and enchants in order to add some player choice and allow players to customize their secondary stats in a post-reforging world. If you want to try a crit-heavy build or want to stack mastery on your healer, you can use our profession system to accomplish that. But if Spirit were an option, it would clearly be the correct choice, and you'd never for a moment consider using any of those other secondary stat options. So in the interest of preserving some interesting choice, we removed Spirit and Armor food/gems/enchants and balanced healers around that change.<br />
<br />
How do you guys determine what will become a toy?<br />
We throw back a shot of vodka and take aim at the &quot;toy or not-toy&quot; dartboard. ;]<br />
<br />
How well do you think the charge system works for spells, verses the more traditional cooldown, and are you planning on converting any more spells to be charge based?<br />
We're pretty happy with that system. The major advantage of that system is the way it allows for more open-ended decisionmaking in spell use that doesn't penalize a player for not using an ability the instant it comes off cooldown. It also lets you deliberately plan ahead and pool usage. I'm not sure we'd want to extend it to ALL abilities, but for abilities that commonly run into the two issues I just outlined, it can really improve usability without needing to add additional mechanics.<br />
<br />
What's the deal currently with your stance on flying, any new developments, or insights?<br />
Overall, we’re happy with how ground travel in Draenor has played out thus far, and we’ve heard a lot of feedback to that effect as well, though we of course recognize that there are players who feel differently. We’ll have more to announce about our 6.1 patch plans in the very near future, but as the focus of our endgame outdoor content remains in the main Draenor zones, our reasons for disallowing flight in 6.0 continue to apply in 6.1. Whether you’re navigating your way to Orumo the Observer in Shattrath Rise, trying to reach a treasure cache atop a column in Spires, or working your way around the ledges encircling The Pit, you’re engaging in gameplay that simply would not exist in a world with unfettered flight. It was never our intent to make large-scale navigation of the world inconvenient, and in 6.1 we’re going to be improving our flight path system to always take the most direct route between two points, even if you have not discovered some of the intermediate nodes. Please keep the feedback coming – if you’re unhappy with the design, some of the most helpful feedback would be specific examples of situations or systems that feel frustrating without being able to fly in Draenor.<br />
<br />
What's the long term plan for WoW?<br />
As Ion said, we don't see an end to Wow coming anytime soon. As long as we have players that love the game, we will keep making new content for them!<br />
<br />
Whatever happened to the appear invisible functionality that was promised to be coming soon in 2012?<br />
It's an idea that's still on the table, but that team (which handles Battle.net functionality for every Blizzard title, not just WoW) has a ton of higher-priority issues and features to work on, so it's not likely to happen in the very near future I'm afraid.<br />
<br />
Scenarios were a great thing for DPS to jump in a quick queue for and do for slightly less rewards than a heroic. Is there any chance we will see end game scenario queues even if it is for the leveling scenarios already in game?<br />
That was definitely one of the great benefits of the scenarios for sure. We don't anticipate having queued scenarios for WoD atm (although I wouldn't rule them out for future expansions), and we do have some ideas for how we can significantly improve dps queue times, but they will take some time for us to make happen.<br />
<br />
Could you elaborate on how you would shorten DPS queue times?<br />
We could potentially allow another dps in a dungeon and use scaling tech to accommodate both 5 and 6 player groups for them.<br />
<br />
With all of the advances in scaling technology for both character and gear level, will we ever see a day when Wintergrasp and Tol Barad are playable at their original intended levels?<br />
Tol Barad and Wintergrasp were implemented with the idea that only one server was playing on them. It would be difficult to convert them. We'd rather create new content. They had their moment in WoW and it was glorious.<br />
<br />
Whats the go with Alchemy? Why does it have no transmutes anymore, no upgradeable class items etc etc.<br />
We are working on some Alchemy updates, more info should be coming along soon.<br />
<br />
will you open up the group finder to show groups from ALL realms in the region?<br />
We've slowly been increasing the number of groups sent down from the server and monitoring it's affect on server performance. Our primary goal with the Group Finder is to help players find someone who is interested in doing the same activity. A leadership system is an interesting idea and we'll monitor whether we feel it's necessary. We're also pretty cautious about providing too much information during the application process. While we want to minimize the amount of time someone will get invited to a group, then immediately kicked, we don't want to encourage discriminatory behavior.<br />
<br />
Any plan to get a better system for transmog? <br />
This is something we hope to do do in a future expansion. We love the idea!<br />
<br />
Are there plans to encourage making friends/connections in LFG/D groups? <br />
We think a &quot;Recently Seen&quot; or something would be great. Definitely on our &quot;want&quot; list right now. We're definitely looking for more ways for people to find each other and build relationships. Let us know what works for you now!<br />
<br />
What are your thoughts about the current system of talents in WoD? Are you satisfied with them or should we be looking forward to changes that make each tree more personalized and dynamic, much like the warrior tree?<br />
One thing we like about the talent trees is the variety they provide. But often, it's a matter of picking the right tool for the job. WoW is a very big game, with a lot of different activities. As a result, some talents perform far better in certain situations (dungeons vs. raids, battlegrounds vs. arenas) and we're okay with that. In the end, every talent doesn't have to be equally viable for all activities. But it is certainly something we try to do when we can.<br />
<br />
Any plans on making PvP and Battlegrounds a more viable way for low level characters and alts to level from? <br />
Unfortunately, some changes we made to battleground rewards broke some of the biggest contributors to XP in low level battlegrounds. We're working on a fix but it may not be available until 6.1.<br />
<br />
Our original plan was to use strongboxes at all levels, but we weren't able to get it done in time. We think this could make it a fun experience though.<br />
<br />
Can you comment on the changes you did to mob pathing with WoD? As a tank player I find myself annoyed by that quite often when trying to position mobs properly. They seem to react much more twitchy to my own movement than they did in MoP.<br />
We actually didn't change mob pathing directly -- we made a ton of improvements to server responsiveness, which means the server (and thus, the mobs) have a more precise idea of where your character is currently standing than they have in the past. The end result is that there's a noticeable difference in the feel of how certain mobs move around, especially for tanks. There really isn't a quick fix for this, but it's something on our radar for sure.<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
<br />
how do you feel about the success of Garrisons, and are there plans for a similar system in future expansions?<br />
Super happy overall with how garrisons have worked out, at least for now. One of our goals for the expansion was to add a feature that felt like it gave players new gameplay that feels important and thematically tied to the expansion. We'll have to wait and see on future expansions. Certainly, we have a goal of providing awesome new gameplay that mixes up your experience for future expansions, but that can take many forms (be it &quot;garrisons 2.0&quot;, elements of garrisons mixed in with other new stuff, other new stuff completely, etc). Regardless, new stuff that fits an expansion well and doesn't feel like an already-solved problem is definitely cool!<br />
<br />
Thoughts on having race-specific garrison buildings?<br />
We actually really love this idea, but in reality, it's not something that's really feasible for us to do. We have 13 races in the game and making unique buildings for all of them is just not in the cards. Instead, we tried to pick and choose specific buildings that could play to individual races character. (Tauren Leatherworking, Gnomish Workship, etc.)<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The art resources for this definitely come directly at the expense of other new content like dungeons or raids. So, while we all totally 100% agree this would be awesome, and we'd likely steer more in that direction if we could, it's not likely for the WoD garrisons. If we were to do an updated version of garrisons in a future expansion, it's much more likely (and would probably be an important goal for us).<br />
<br />
Is it intended that my friends are unable to use the portals in my spirit lodge or see my archaeology trophy room in my town hall?<br />
Not intended, will be fixed in 6.1.<br />
<br />
I don't like chaotic music in my garrison, but love wow music as a whole. Please let me put on something relaxing while mining instead of booming chaos themes.<br />
We are working on a way for you to have custom music in your Garrison. Hoping to get this into patch 6.1.0. I am personally super stoked about this!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the kind words! In regards to Garrisons carrying forward, we need to wait and see how it plays out. We designed the system in a way that it can be left behind, but we could also choose to take certain parts or technology and carry them on to new expansions.<br />
<br />
Why is the loot table on level 3 salvage crates so damn big?<br />
A common misconception is that large tables necessarily mean more randomness, or that items are competing with each other. There are lots of ways of constructing treasure tables to avoid this. After many reports from players concerned with seemingly poor yield of follower rewards from Level 3 salvage crates, we took a really thorough look through the data and tested extensively to make 100% sure we weren't missing something.<br />
<br />
A level 3 salvage crate actually gives you a guaranteed direct pull from the level 2 salvage loot table, PLUS additional chances to get transmog, legacy, or current items for your character to use or sell. The loot table is large to offer tons of variety, and there are definitely some jackpot items in there (Everburning Candle says hi), but it's not coming at the expense of the core follower items or resources you got from level 1 and level 2.<br />
<br />
Are there any plans to better integrate garrisons across a player's account, or perhaps even just realm/faction?<br />
We agree with you on this. We are going to try and find ways to make Garrisons easier on alts though the patch cycle.<br />
<br />
It seems as if a lot of the elements of Garrisons (follwer missions, work orders, etc.) were designed with the mobile Armory in mind. Will we be seeing an update to the mobile app to include Garrions features?<br />
Not likely. It's a really cool idea (one we've heard a lot), but as the Garrison is intended as a Warlords-only feature, there are several other potential improvements we could make to the mobile app that would have more long-term use, if we decided to expand its feature set.<br />
<br />
I should clarify: it's intended as a feature that we don't have to bring along with us into the next expansion (like a new profession would be, for example). However, it's something we can bring along if we want to, or even repurpose a lot of the same tech to provide something else. Opens up a lot of options for future expansions.<br />
<br />
Are there plans to expand the garrison further than level 3? The phase where the garrison is seems to be a little bit big for what they are.<br />
There are plans to do more with garrison building progression in patch 6.2. Details at a future date since we're still fairly early working on 6.2.<br />
<br />
Why does the amount of Missions decrease substantially when all the active followers are level 100? <br />
We were hoping not to have a bunch of irrelevant missions spamming up your mission list. We didn't plan well enough for the fact that those missions aren't really irrelevant when the salvage yard is OP. It's definitely an issue we talk about here, but solutions are complex and can have a lot of ripple-effect consequences on the rest of the system/game.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Originally missions all pulled from a single pool; players found that as they got their first level 100 followers they got fewer low-level missions and had a harder time leveling their weaker followers, so we made a change to ensure that some low-level missions would always pop if you had a follower in that range who needed them. We recognize this causes some odd incentives (you're encouraged to NOT max all your followers) and are discussing good solutions to that problem.<br />
<br />
do you guys plan on improving upon garrisons every patch e.g more buildings, more plots, extra interactions (similar to invasions) and more customization (faction guards) to prevent the garrisons from becoming stale?<br />
We plan to add some form of Garrison content in every patch, we want to keep it fresh too.<br />
<br />
Are there plans to expand the garrison further than level 3? The phase where the garrison is seems to be a little bit big for what they are.<br />

<br />
Any more info about how the Mine is supposed to work in regards to Carts?<br />
Carts showing up without a follower parked is a bug on our end. The carts are bonus you get based on having a Mining follower parked at the Mine. We reduced the overall number of carts but increased the amount of loot you get from each one. Thanks for the questions!<br />
<br />
Is it intentional to be garrison mission starved once all your followers are 100? It feels crappy to have to bring in a scrub level 90 and level 95 to spawn as many missions as possible for the salvage yard.<br />
Not intended. Don't have any details on a fix just yet, but we're looking into it.<br />
<br />
The Dwarven Bunker/War Mill transmog armor is currently Account Bound as opposed to Battle.net Account Bound. It's pretty frustrating to not be able to send it between my accounts, especially considering how rare the Iron Horde scraps seem to be. Is this intended or an oversight?<br />
That's an oversight on our part. We will get that fixed up. Thanks!<br />
<br />
Why do some Garrison work orders count towards such achievements like Working More Orders and others do not? Mines and Herbalist work orders don't seem to count.<br />
This is a bug, we are working to hotfix it ASAP.<br />
<br />
Just a quick question, would it be possible to convert Broken Bones to a currency?<br />
Definitely hear the feedback on broken bones.<br />
<br />
Art / Character Models<br />
<br />
are new worgen and goblin models in the works? Any updates on that?<br />
No plans for that at the moment.<br />
<br />
Are the already released new character models still being tweaked and worked on?<br />
We are planning to make some additional updates and tweaks to the new character models, yes.<br />
<br />
Does this include new customisation options? Because I'd love to see Mag'har/Blackrock/Dragonmaw/Laughing Skull skins for player Orc characters.<br />
Chris Robinson (our Art Director) has mentioned that he'd love to see stuff like that as well, there's just a lot of higher-priority projects that need the art team's attention first.<br />
<br />
Is there any consideration into redoing the run animation for Night Elves?<br />
Yes, I believe that's on the list of things to refine, potentially in patch 6.1. Don't quote me on that though. =]<br />
<br />
Any update on class accessories?<br />
The idea is still alive! We actually just had a meeting about this a few weeks ago. It's not on the table for 6.0, but we are certainly discussing it for a future expansion.<br />
<br />
Are there any plans for Moonkin remodels, bear remodels and warlock pet remodels? (Looking at you Felguard.)<br />
We hear you - primary focus for Warlords was on the main player models, but this is definitely something we want to do.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of spells out there that could really use some love, like Fire mage (Fireball, Pyroblast), Shadow Priest (Mind Flay, Shadow Word: Pain, and some others) and a lot of the effects for the melee classes are pretty poor, too.<br />
We totally hear you guys on this. We have a team of folks working to improve the overall sound, look and feel of Wow combat in general for future expansions. More updates to come on this in the future.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The time required can vary quite a bit depending on the particulars of the spell. We'd definitely like to take a look at some of the older spell visuals and update them though.<br />
<br />
PvP / Arena / Ashran<br />
<br />
What are you current feelings overall about the state of PVP. What's good, what's bad and where to from here?<br />
We had three big additions to PvP in Warlords: Skirmishes, Ashran and the Strongbox reward system. I think Skirmishes and Strongboxes have worked out really well, but Ashran has some definite problems.<br />
<br />
With respect to class balance in Arena and RBGs, we're evaluating it and making adjustments when appropriate. It's important that in each new expansion, we give classes cool new toys. The addition of new talents/abilities/glyphs and changes to tuning really rattle the status quo in terms of balance. Our first focus is to ensure that the general gameplay environment is fun (i.e. people aren't invincible or dying in a global). Then we move towards balancing out outlier classes. But, classes are going to have things that feel &quot;too strong.&quot; We just need to make sure they have weaknesses as well.<br />
<br />
What was the reasoning as to taking RBGS weekly conquest cap out and placing with ashran weekly 200 cap? Please allow RBGS 1 cap for 200 and keep ashran cap for weekly!<br />
Though many players understand how the rating to conquest cap system works, it's quite complicated. One number (my rating) converts to another rating (my cap) in a rather mysterious way. With the separate cap for RBGs, this became even more complicated.<br />
<br />
We think having a variety of competitive activities is important for WoW PvP to continue to be a success. RBGs require significantly more time to coordinate and run than 2v2 arenas, for example. So it's important that we incentivize people to do them in a way that feels good.<br />
<br />
To make the system simpler, we eliminated the additional conquest cap and provided bonus chances at loot for RBG victories.<br />
<br />
For Ashran, we felt like it was worthwhile to give end game PvPers that participate a unique bonus. It's a fixed size cap, so it feels good if you do it, but ignoring it doesn't really hurt your progression through the season.<br />
<br />
AMA question - Does Blizzard think PvP Healing -in general- is OP? If yes, what ways you're looking to adress it? For example, nerfing classes' healing individually, Resilience/Battle Fatigue or just gonna do it with 'turning bit of healing into kill buffs'.<br />
We don't think healing -in general- is OP. We do think that certain specs and spells are too strong. We recently removed the healing benefits of Predatory Swiftness from Ferals and halved the benefits of Heart of the Wild in PvP. Today, we have a hotfix to reduce the healing of Paladin Flash of Light by 20%.<br />
<br />
But at the same time, I think people often get overly fixated on the scoreboard. Healing is one type of defense a player can use in PvP, but there are a lot of others that don't show up on the scoreboard. For example, we have no &quot;damage mitigated&quot; column to show that a Warriors Defensive stance is effectively reducing a significant amount of damage being done to them. We also can't quantify the defensive benefit of a Warlock teleporting behind a pillar when they get in trouble. Some classes do not have strong escapes and their only strategy is to heal through the pressure.<br />
<br />
Now, this doesn't mean we won't continue to look at healing (specifically self-healing and off-healing) as way to tune PvP balance. We want every class to feel like they can compete.<br />
<br />
Anyways, could you talk about the design decisions behind the balance of racials? I know I'm not alone here when I say it feels like the Alliance has a definite upper hand compared to the Horde.<br />
Ah well, it is time for the alliance to shine. Horde has been quite the trendy thing for the last decade it seems. ;]<br />
<br />
Will you add new battlegrounds?<br />
We want to add new battlegrounds. Not sure when though.<br />
<br />
After the start of the pvp season.. are you guys committed to fixing the faction imbalance in arena due to racial passives?<br />
I addressed this in another post but the TLDR answer is that we think there is more at play than racials at determing faction representation on the ladder. Specifically, you cannot play arenas cross-faction and people usually play arenas with their friends. People will decide that one faction is the &quot;best faction&quot; and go to that one (even if the advantage is marginal).<br />
<br />
Throughout the Blizzcon tournament, we saw players playing different factions based on the comp they were playing against.<br />
<br />
Are there any fixes in the works to balance WoD PvP? If so, how soon can we expect them? The statistics on arenamate.net are quite frankly disturbing, even considering how new the season is.<br />
First, Vanguards is a great guy and we would all be so lucky if this was Warlords of Vanguard. Second, I think if you compared the representation at the beginning of this season to the beginning of Mists you'd be surprised at the diversity. Certainly, Disc priests have significantly higher representation than any other spec. But we've seen warriors or shamans doubling everyone else's representation in the past.<br />
<br />
But I'm more concerned about the general gameplay in arena and not that classes that traditionally don't have high representation now have high representation.<br />
<br />
Quick question, Will Oceanic get our own PvP bracket? Or stay in US with the old latency?<br />
No plans for a unique Oceanic bracket at this time. The small pool of players would make queue times atrocious.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
We also find that small regions have a harder time with collusion and win-trading. Right now it's best to keep ANZ with NA.<br />
<br />
Will there be balance changes throughout the PvP season or will we have to wait whole seasons again for things to get adjusted?<br />
We'll be tuning classes throughout the season. Early on in the expansion, we realize we've made a lot of big changes to classes and balance will be rather volatile. So, you could expect more changes early on and then the rate of change tapering off towards the expansion's end.<br />
<br />
What are some of the things you learned from Ashran?<br />
Some things we've learned our: - We haven't educated players enough about the benefits of the outer parts of the zone. The best way to earn honor is collecting fragments and there are a lot of powerful buffs littered out there. - We could use a good system for automatic raid management in certain areas. We don't put everyone in a raid in Ashran because not everyone is in the middle. Players that want to focus on the middle usually take care of that themselves. But we could do a better job with this. - We don't have any &quot;doppleganger&quot; servers so trying to balance factions by pairing servers is hard. In China, there are a lot more Horde players than Alliance. In other regions, PvP servers are mostly Horde players. PvP servers tend to be far more polarized by faction than PvE servers. It creates a lot of problems bringing people together. But we really wanted Ashran to feel like a zone attached to your server more than just a battleground you go to.<br />
<br />
When will Kronos be fixed in Ashran?<br />
We're working on it! We tried some new things with the AI for NPCs in Ashran's center road. Unfortunately, a lot of those techniques haven't stood up to large player counts. We've been hotfixing them and simplifying their AI. Before, they would try to navigate to whatever capture point was active. Now, they'll just get pissed and head straight for the enemy base attacking any enemy they come in contact with.<br />
<br />
Generally, we acknowledge Ashran has both design problems and technical ones (queueing). We're continuing to work to fix them.<br />
<br />
Creating a PvP zone for 200+ people is a really unique challenge and the way that rewards influence behavior is pretty profound. We're seeing a lot of different problems than what we saw on beta.<br />

please allow full, x-realm raids to enter ashran whole<br />
We have enabled cross-realm raids in Ashran. We held back on this until we felt we could enforce faction parity more. Otherwise, people would just starting looking for the &quot;all-alliance&quot; ashran. Definitely feel you on the Broken Bones.<br />

Any plans on making PvP and Battlegrounds a more viable way for low level characters and alts to level from?<br />
Unfortunately, some changes we made to battleground rewards broke some of the biggest contributors to XP in low level battlegrounds. We're working on a fix but it may not be available until 6.1.<br />
<br />
Our original plan was to use strongboxes at all levels, but we weren't able to get it done in time. We think this could make it a fun experience though.<br />
<br />
Really looking for answers about how pvp is going to be balanced this expansion. Can we expect balance hotfixes every week?<br />
I wouldn't expect balance hotfixes every week. Players often look at representation as a measure of balance and it takes significant changes to really move the needle in the representation department.<br />
<br />
Early on in the expansion, we're aware that a lot of class changes have been very disruptive to balance. We're also aware that a lot of bugs creep into the game. For example, Disc priest absorb shields were critting for a full 200% while other classes had their crit heals reduced. Fixing this bug will have a pretty profound effect on balance.<br />
<br />
We'll be spending a lot of time playing the game, gathering feedback and adjusting accordingly. But we don't want to change people's classes from underneath them throughout the expansion.<br />
<br />
how do you guys approach balance in terms of PVE vs PVP? I know in the past the PVP guy was told to just shut up by Jay Wilson of course that was a different game and I hope that doesn't happen in WoW.<br />
Also, the whole Jay Wilson &quot;Shut up PvP guy&quot; thing is absolute rubbish. I know Jay. I talked to him all the time. He is super nice and super supportive of everything we do. If anything I am the &quot;PvP guy&quot; and no one at Blizzard has ever told me to &quot;Shut Up PvP guy.&quot; It has always been the opposite. They hired me to help the team make PvP better because it is a goal they have.<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Healing overall in Highmaul, even on normals (at least as a holy paladin) is hard. Everyone seems to take a considerable amount of damage at the same time. If the fights are relativly short it's something that is handable. But any fights that last beyond 4 minutes and holy paladins have a hard time keeping up. There is very little AoE healing going on as a paladin. Our 2 AoE heals without a cooldown either cost way more mana and heal for little, or cost no mana and heal for a little more. I can't keep people up using Holy Radiance or Light of Dawn. Eternal Flame as a finisher is way better to use then Light of Dawn, especially with Beacon of Faith and spamming Flash of Light is the only way holy paladins can keep up with the other healers AoE wise, and it causes me to run on fumes for at least 1/4th of the fight. Is this a concern seen by the Dev team? I know we are supposed to use Holy Light as much as possible, but it's just too slow.<br />
We're keeping a very close eye on healing overall as raiding begins. From personal experience, observation, and talking to other healers, a lot of what we're seeing is a mix of learning new fights (and thus people in general taking large amounts of avoidable damage) and healers getting used to not panicking when someone is at 60% or 70% health. Both of those are things that should improve over time. We recognize that it's one of the risks of a more deliberate healing pace: in Mists mistakes might have been instantly lethal due to spikier damage, while in Warlords they're survivable in the short-term, but are bleeding healers try in the long term. If you aren't cleaning out the stands on Kargath, or people are triggering arcane mines on Mar'gok, that might not instantly wipe you, but it'll absolutely lead to your healers running out of gas eventually. That said, raid healing in particular tends to lend itself towards more specialization, and raid leaders may find that it makes sense to have their paladins focus a bit more on single-target healing, which is a clear niche thanks to Beacon, while other classes blanket the raid.<br />
<br />
Please comment on direction of Mages going forward.<br />
Mages going forward will be going forward. Unless they aren't.<br />
<br />
in regards to the ability pruning, I know that the most iconic abilities tended to be spared, and yet... Protection Paladins lost Avenging Wrath?<br />
We felt like both the Guardian and Wings were cool and wanted to keep them but thought it was a good opportunity to have some spec variation.<br />
<br />
Do you agree that the Shaman class has lost much of it's identity over the years?<br />
Probably the biggest blow to shaman identity came in Wrath (2008) when most buffs were changed to raidwide and were generally standardized among classes as a result. There was certainly something cool about bringing unique buffs like Windfury, and having a large number of those buffs that you could call uniquely your own. But it was quite a bit less cool being the Fury warrior who was only a viable endgame raid DPS with a shaman in your party, or being the raid leader playing party Tetris and cycling Bloodlusts through the melee group, or the elemental shaman who didn't get a raid spot because the spec's damage output was mediocre and they were only worthwhile if there was an open spot in the warlock/warlock/warlock/spriest group. I don't think returning to that would be the answer.<br />
<br />
So, yes, the shaman is no longer a buff-bot. What, then, is the shaman identity? We do see totems as remaining a large part of that identity, and tried in Mists to remove passive buff totems and refocus them as more concentrated and intense effects that do something powerful in the short-term -- Capacitor, Tremor, Grounding, Healing Tide, etc. (not going to argue that Searing fits into this model or is particularly sexy, though). I'd be curious to hear (from you, from everyone) what it is about the shaman class that most resonates (or resonated, in the event that you've lost that lovin' feeling) with you.<br />
<br />
&quot;...or the elemental shaman who didn't get a raid spot because the spec's damage output was mediocre...&quot;<br />
I don't mean to be disrespectful, Mr. Hazzikostas, but the very thing you said you were avoiding is happening right now as we speak.<br />
I really should have said &quot;abysmal&quot; rather than mediocre. When DPS shaman brought a suite of unique buffs in TBC, their damage was routinely 30-40% behind &quot;real&quot; damage-dealers, not the 10% that is often bemoaned today.<br />
<br />
Even with states of Normal Butcher, Heroic Butcher and Normal Ogron you feel enhancement and elemental is perfoming strongly?<br />
<br />
Check out Tectus or Mar'gok for a different picture, though.<br />
<br />
I realize it's not that simple (and no, I'm not going to argue that Fire Nova should be the defining niche of the Enhancement shaman) but what matters is the game in its totality, not a specific encounter.<br />
<br />
Do you feel that Shaman-balance should take the form of number tweaking, or is the sudden outcry for an all-out rework justified?<br />
We've already made some numbers tweaks, and we'll make some more as needed. There's no question that Enhance and especially Elemental were weak during the initial days of Warlords, but at this point we're seeing both specs performing very solidly in dungeons as well as a range of encounters in Highmaul. We'll of course continue to watch balance as gear and strategies evolve, and watch PvP representation and success as the arena/RBG season really gets underway. In the short term, I would not expect a drastic overhaul. Drastic overhauls of classes are something we do rarely, and then almost exclusively with expansions and not patches. There are plenty of shaman out there who are having fun who don't want to log in to find their class completely changed overnight. But that doesn't that there isn't room for improvement. A number of the points above regarding talents are very valid, and there's definitely room for more differentiation through that avenue. And the Call/Persistence/Projection row is terrible.<br />
<br />
What would you like to tell Shamans who feel like second class Druids?<br />
Druids are cats/bears/turkeys/trees; you are mail-clad warriors of the elements. Have faith, and try to focus feedback in a constructive way that focuses on specific areas of discontent. We're listening.<br />
<br />
In any case, the numbers don't entirely bear out that assertion (Elemental has very strong single-target DPS, as Butcher parses will attest) though there was regrettably some real damage done in terms of overall community perception during the first couple of weeks before the hotfixes. We are keeping an eye not just on damage, but on representation.<br />
<br />
With the loss of Ancestral Vigor and Mana Tide and the output of other healers, it seems R Sham's only justifiable presence is the ability to continue to heal during HTT. Do you have any ideas to remedy our plight?<br />
Ancestral Vigor was honestly a stopgap measure at a time (mid-Cata) when Resto Shaman was by far the dominant arena healer, but the weakest healer in raids. We used AV to prop the spec up and help ensure they'd usually have at least a single raid slot while we tried to sort out the thornier balance issues with the spec. At this point, however, we feel that the overall Resto healing toolkit holds up against other specs head-to-head, and there's no longer a need for Vigor.<br />
<br />
Why does the Vers + 505 Int proc pvp trinket proc when using burning rush.<br />

Hi five! Gaming has gotten me through some rough times as well.<br />

I don't have an answer, I just wanted to respond to your comment because everyone else was doing it and I want to feel included.<br />
<br />
(but srsly glad you're enjoying the game, and hoping for the best for you!)<br />
<br />
Hey guys love the expansion. How much attention do you pay to the outside community. The Instance, Wow Insider and MMO-Champion in particular<br />
I have a long commute and listen to a lot of community podcasts. Specifically Convert to Raid and the Instance.<br />
<br />
As a huge fan of Legendary, The Weekly Marmot, PST, and PST Rapid Fire, I miss your videos a ton, but I was wondering if you ever miss making that content. Also, what was your favorite moment during your YouTube/Tankspot/GamebreakerTV times?<br />
Definitely miss making that content. I've actually started a new podcast with Mike B recently -- I won't directly promote it here, but you could probably find it on Google or something.<br />
<br />
Favorite moment would probably be the original &quot;Halo MMO&quot; tinfoil hat stuff, especially now that I've been able to peek behind the curtain as a Blizzard employee :P<br />
<br />
What Dev throws the best parties?<br />

I don't know, but my money is on Alex Afrasiabi being the most interesting guest at a party.<br />
<br />
WoW Development<br />
<br />
What do you guys look for in applicants to work on the Game design team for WoW?<br />
We honestly look for great game design instincts above all else. Clearly someone needs to be a good personality fit as well, but it all starts with a key understanding of the fundamentals of great gameplay.<br />
<br />
Why was this boss fight fun? Break that down for us and tell us why. Why was this quest terrible? Break that down for us and tell us how you would improve it.<br />
<br />
We are always looking for well rounded designers that can handle lots of different situations and problems. We hire designers from all sorts of different sources, it all just comes down to their individual talent.<br />
<br />
How many of you actively play the game outside of work hours and now many reached level cap in this expansion?<br />
Almost all of us I'd say. It's actually a very different experience playing at home with friends/family than it is playtesting at work, so it doesn't feel like &quot;work&quot; when playing from home. For example, even though I've run missions like crazy for the better part of a year, it has still been a blast logging in every chance I get to make sure my followers are being used efficiently. =]<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
All of us play, with a wide variety of playstyles. Garrison missions have probably had a non-trivial impact on office productivity the past few weeks.... We love the game, and of course it's also essential to be experiencing the gameplay and potential issues firsthand so that we can really understand what's working well, what isn't, what's frustrating, etc. Personally, I've been doing tons of Heroics, daily CMs, and jumped right into Highmaul last night (I couldn't raid on Tuesday night either!).<br />
<br />
How long does it take to create, test and ship out a raid instance at this point in time?<br />
The anniversary video was talking specifically of the encounter creation part of it (a week didn't encompass the environment and creature art time). No doubt that was still a feat though, it was amazing to see it come together so quickly. Certainly, the production value of the raid encounters these days is significantly higher (environmental gameplay, visual effects, encounter mechanics, flex difficulty, etc) so it takes many more hours to make an encounter today than it did back then. So, lots of time!<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Making a raid zone nowadays is a huge endeavor that touches virtually all parts of the team in some form. From start to finish, Throne of Thunder or Siege of Orgrimmar each took 6-7 months to go from a 2D layout and a general concept to a playable, tested, tuning, and polished experience. (Spoilers: We're working on the next big raid zone right now.)<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
Is there a chance that we could have an option to stop moving background in certain dungeons/raids? Grimrail Depot causes 2 of my guildmates to have motion sickness when we are doing the second and third bosses. <br />
Ugh, sorry to hear that. =[ Not sure that we have a quick/easy solution for that, but we'll take into consideration.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Sorry, there's actual motion going on and not a simple graphical effect that can be disabled. Agree it's rough for your friend. All I can suggest is to zoom in a bit and you can largely avoid having much movement in your field of view.<br />
<br />
The UI community, especially those of us from EU, would really love a dedicated CM for that department, there currently is no easy way for us to report problems and we tend to find them first<br />
I know our UI team reads the UI forums regularly, but feel free to contact me about addon development issues if you like. Easiest way to do that is probably through Twitter at @CM_Lore. <br />
<br />
Oh one other thing I should note just to be clear: that includes the EU UI forums. :)<br />
<br />
The “Currency” tab has been bugging me since WoD ever since the start of the expansion, as it’s always sorted alphabetically (and always last) and the “collapse”/”expand” state is never saved upon a reload of the UI.<br />
Currency tab is a known issue. We'll get that fixed.<br />
<br />
In regards to addons, how do you determine what will become baseline in the client? For example, being able to determine and sort by the cost per item in a stack on the AH is extremely useful.<br />
We try to add things that feel like they would be useful to the majority of our player base, but without adding bloat or confusion. Good examples of this would be armor sets, raid frames, bag sorting and cooldown counters. We tend to stay away from addons that are very complicated with lots of options since those lean towards smaller groups of players and would complicate the game for others.<br />
<br />
How do you feel about this shift over time, and have you thought about any new ways to inspire the growth of closer-knit communities and cameraderie, like your addition of the Premade Group Finder and Guild Achievements?<br />
We feel like it's crucial that we support both the &quot;easy in, easy out&quot; gameplay of dungeon/raid finder for players that are just in the mood to quickly run some content. However, the addition of the group finder is a first step toward improving the other side of the coin, as we also want the game to do a better job of fostering cooperative play and enabling longer-term relationships to be created. We have more stuff in mind for the future to continue to make this better/cooler.<br />
<br />
So where are the fungal whales in the Zangar Sea?<br />
Sounds like we need a follower mission for that... The Fungal Whale Expedition.<br />
<br />
Are you able to reveal any plans you have for future expansions?<br />
We have plans for an expansion that will come after this expansion, and it will be the next expansion. That is all for now. ;]<br />
<br />
Just a quick question: Why not add a title for having lots of titles? Like , the Entitled?<br />
Where is the &quot;Like&quot; button on Reddit<br />
<br />
Is Sargeras going to eventually be a 10 phase fight that takes 2 hours to complete and rewards us with a 10 minute cinematic farewell to WoW?<br />
Multiply all that by 10!<br />
<br />
This is a lore question, but I think it could be game related as well, where on Draenor is Dentarg? I have not seen him at all.<br />
Good question, I can't say I have a good answer that I wouldn't be making up on the spot.<br />
<br />
it seems like recently taxis have been eating pets, elementals, and demons.<br />
This is a bug, and we're working on a fix in the near future.<br />
<br />
Would you consider adding a keybind / casting modifier that allows us to target &quot;targetable spells&quot; at our current target or ourselves?<br />
I don't know about using a player's location as a target for the spell, but it could be cool to have some type of smartcast interface to cast a spell at your mouse's location. Maybe in the future.<br />
<br />
There seems to be a lot of people that have an issue with Garosh's father being the last boss in WOD. Is he definatelu the last boss or may there be a surprise for people?<br />
There will be a surprise, and we're looking forward to players hearing more sometime &quot;soon&quot;!<br />
<br />
How about randomizing secondary stats on Apexis Crystal gear? Same way it happens with gear from all other sources. Also adding something like a 1000 crystal re-roll thingy will make it worthwhile.<br />
Fair point, probably would have been a good idea to do so in retrospect.<br />

You mean like they added it back after the subs dropped in cata? Or when the subs dropped in MoP? Oh wait...they weren't the cause for the drops, not did it stop the peak to 10 mill. I wonder what that means. Hint: Flying does not effect subs in any way, shape or form.</div></div><hr />

Where have I heard this before? Oh right, months and months through out beta and when it was announced by the vocal people on the forums. And this expansion was the one that sold the most in it's firt 24 hours. Please. I'm screen saving this to see the huge drop that you're claiming.<br />
<br />
And even if they lose all 100 peolple to this, I'm sure that they'be happier to make the game how they like it, a game they want to play. It's obvious that the devs resent the idea of it, and I agree. Hope it doesn't come back til the last patch or when Draenor's main land is irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ditto. I think no-restrictions flying, especially with how fast flying mounts are, makes the world feel much smaller. As long as players have efficient flight paths available from various flightmasters, I don't think the loss of flying will be a major problem. For those on PvP servers, lack of flying mounts also makes things a lot more fun and interesting.<br />

&quot;How about randomizing secondary stats on Apexis Crystal gear? Same way it happens with gear from all other sources. Also adding something like a 1000 crystal re-roll thingy will make it worthwhile.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Fair point, probably would have been a good idea to do so in retrospect.&quot;<br />
<br />
Fuck. That. Shit. Can you even imagine spending 5k crystals on a shoulder item only to have it be itemized with your two worst stats?<br />
<br />
Be like doing random dungeons while leveling and getting a Stamina/Intelligence item on your warrior. Like... it is not possible for warriors to ever be able to use INT, so why in the hell are you rolling it? Or cloaks with agility, etc.<br />
<br />
Except worse.</div></div><hr />

Shit argument. People don't need to see the very same ground texture 1 more time than they already have just to appreciate it. &quot;I made this ground texture, and I know you've had to remain on the ground to &quot;admire&quot; my work until now, but I just don't think that's enough for you to REALLY appreciate how much work I put into this rocky texture here!&quot;<br />

<br />
You know when Blizzard can start forcing players to enjoy the stuff they work on? When they actually do their best to get all of that shit in the actual game. A game with developers that's too lazy to even try and work in all the models they create, where every expansion, there's an arsenal of armour and weapon models unused and obtainable almost as large as the arsenal of armour and weapon models that are used and obtainable. They don't get to whine about their artists being under-appreciated when they themselves do not even appreciate the work of their artists enough to actually put it in the game, while the players actually want to see those models put in the game.<br />

I don't see this logic.<br />

It worked fine in Pandaria. I see the beautiful content from forced ground mounts while leveling, I see every hand crafted vista and view, I enjoy it, awe at it and remember my experience of seeing it the first time. I don't grow to appreciate their work more by being forced to walk over it 20 more times, I start to grow a disdain for it.

Yep. But, not like I ever have to leave my garrison anymore. Everything sells terribly (I did make some off inscription). Once I have my rare spawn mounts I never have to leave again. I dont ever see myself going for a run just to see the scenery. Honestly, you should have to farm things like the Barn to have the mine and garden work. I have enough herbs, I have enough ore.

<br />
good that shammies gets alot of attention thou they sure fucking need it.<br />
<br />
dont get me wrong DK:s are doing good on dps, but there are major flaws in frost both stat and scaling.<br />
<br />
For instance oblitarate deals no frost damage, thus mastery dont effect it.<br />
We also dont have a good talent for singeltarget dps or wtf cooldown, while other classes have plentysome that increases their burst by a TON, all we have is empowered rune weapon and pillar of frost, both wich is not WTF cooldowns. if empowered rune weapon only was for 5 seconds u dont lose any runes, would be so much better or so you can glyph it so it does it instead of the heal and reset runes. so you can choose.<br />
<br />
pillar of frost is a GREAT cooldown, that increases our damage, but its not a WTF cooldown either its a cooldown that increases our damage but not a burst cooldown compared to other classes i feel we need one.</div></div><hr />

I already completed both stable achievements (the necklace and the claw ones) and in truth they took me around 15mins each day. It's not like they're all on separate zones and there's no flight paths available. <br />

Do they really want to play the game or wished everything was like the followers' missions?</div></div><hr />

Hint: Flying does not effect subs in any way, shape or form.<br />
<br />
What? MoP and Cata numbers TANKED after their releases because people hated the double gating grind with dailies in MoP and Cata had terribly difficult dungeons for casuals/pugs. They absolutely reversed their philosophy after they saw what it was doing to the sub numbers. Here's another fact, each expansion had an increase in subs. It still remains to be seen if WoW will maintain the 10mil from launch or drop off.<br />

<br />
No reputation grind fixes, who in their right mind finds it fun to kill endless amount of mobs for low rep gain? How is that fun gameplay? Same as the 40man raids roaming The Pit for apexis crystals etc..<br />
Somewhere in the line of communication there's a huge block. Dailies were bad, but this is even worse, i'd take a bunch of dailies any day over this nonsense. Who do you have to write and how big do the capital letters have to be that they acknowledge this is NOT FUN gameplay.<br />
<br />
No flying.. figures.. Still got half of the MoP and some Cata content where you can fly to be done so not even mad.<br />
Would have been best to just continue to play as i originally intended one expansion behind everyone else, when difficulty doesn't matter and content gating is made up.<br />
<br />
Yet there's acknowledgement to shortening random hc queue, what? The queue is now the shortest it has been in 5 years. Maximum of 20 minutes for dps on very low traffic times meaning from 05am to 07am and mostly it's around 10 minutes. In 10 minutes you can't even complete a single daily quest. I've taken bathroom breaks longer than what the queues are now, and you can't even finish those cause the lfg pops up, have to run click yes with pants around ankles.</div></div><hr />

To me personally the immersion is the most important thing in a game.<br />
Regardless if flying is there or not, the worlds immersion is still there, same trees, same hills.<br />
Choosing the method how to move in the world is still up to the player.<br />
Want to experience the ground level, nothing wrong with that, you can even when flying mount are opted in.<br />
And don't give me that if flying mounts are in you're forced to use them because they are superior crap.<br />
If you want to experience the ground level you choose to experience it, that simple.<br />
If it's travel time you're worried you leave 1 minutes early. <br />
<br />
Skipping quests while leveling or finding treasures, is a reason not to have flying, but guess what that part is now over. Nothing to find since it's all been discovered.<br />
<br />
World pvp or more people on the ground, don't even start.. People who are done with the world are now standing in their garrisons or cities and out there you meet the same people as you did before the people who are LEVELING or grinding something. And no one wants to meet gankers (read the only form of wpvp), except the gankers themselves. If you have to choose between gankers and flying, I choose personal realms, where you play alone. If you choose doing group outdoor content with people who don't understand how to play the game (NO not in the sense of what's my idea of playing, but in the basic most simplistic way, how to press the one button their class has, or where to stand and not to die. No one plays this game to stand in fire and die, so why are people still doing that?), i choose personal realms.<br />
And people wonder why the community is so bad.. Because it's full of people who would rather play alone (I know i would, currently my happiest play time is soloing heroic Dragon Soul 25, cause there's no other 24 people to worry about, if i fail it's only me and recovery takes as long as it takes me to do it, not full raid who runs to the entrance with all the mobs after them to prolong a wipe just to live) than play with others who don't care or bots or whatever hinders the group.<br />
In a game where skill doesn't matter, difficulty is non existent, there's only one measurement, time consumed. Anything that prolongs and hinders that is bad.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Breccia</div><div class="date">2014-12-05, 06:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My stance has always been: they already know if flying will ever be possible, or not.<br />
<br />
Based on the belf and draenei starting zones still not having flying, and the blue posts as to why not, it's pretty safe to say that adding flying to a zone that is not designed to have it is a difficult task. Therefore, if they ever planned on having flying, even a &quot;maybe&quot;, it seems pretty reasonable that they made flying an option from the very start, as they did with all the other BC zones. I also would bet that, if they did put in the work required for zones to have flying possible, they wouldn't throw all that work out by never allowing flying -- it would be wasted time. By contrast, if they planned to never have flying possible, they very likely skipped all the work involved in making it possible -- it would also have been wasted time. <br />
<br />
So, I think they know if they'll add flying ever, and they aren't telling us. To me, the smart move is to make flying an option for them, one that they can control and add when they feel it's warranted, so they don't have to spend the (apparently) large amount of time and effort to add flying to a zone that wasn't designed for it. My Archaeology achievements will wait until then.</div></div><hr />

Unsubbing because you can't fly on Draenor is a little silly imo.

Yeah &quot;world pvp&quot;, you're grinding reps mobs with just enough mobs that you can pull or doing your stables limited supply mount-in-training when some random guy from opposite faction pops in and decides he wants to pvp with you while you aren't interested in slightest and just want to get the thing you're grinding done asap, essentially forcing you to a graveyard run, cause you refuse to pvp with such morons. Or even better they spent a charge off from the 3 charge mount-in-training forcing you to go back to garrison to get new reins just for one mob, what a great enjoyment...<br />
At that point i myself am doing that so much missed in-game &quot;social interaction&quot;, bnet inviting the son of a bitch and giving him a piece of mind mind, just cause of one fuckin nerdrage that they cost me 2 minutes of my time that i didn't want to invest in them in the first place, that's just ridiculous for a grown up man who never looses his temper over anything and can rationalize every other situation he'll encounter, but all hell breaks loose if someone ganks in a videogame. Great fucking immersion, i'm sure the neighbors of every gamer in the world really appreciate the yelling and cursing.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a one organised world pvp event or faction war in outside Draenor since release, for the matter of fact i haven't seen one organized world pvp event outside since classic southshore/tarren mill, oh wait no, there was one rp faction world pvp war during tbc in Blasted Lands, one. All the rest is just ganking, nothing but pure ganking on opponents that don't want to fight or are outgeared or outleveled.<br />
<br />
And the immersion of more people in the world, yeah that's great.<br />
You see 40man raids camping rare spawn mounts, in one spot, for 17 hours. They don't do anything else, but stand in one spot. Great immersion!<br />
Oh wait they do, 50% of them dual screen a movie while they wait, the rest spam /general /raid /say with how they masturbated 7 times in the last hour or anal dirge. Great immersion! <br />
In a roleplaying game it seems that 50% of the population are roleplaying 13 year old boys who've discovered words about genitals for the first time and now repeat the same word over and over.<br />
Or you encounter single person or groups grinding mobs for rep or other items, not contributing to the world in any other way, but their own goal to reach exalted or gaining an item.<br />
Or the most typical player, the leveling guy questing, doing a quest and then moving to the next quest.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen a single player or group actually roleplaying in the outside world in 3 years, in a roleplaying game, oh the humanity!<br />
It's all loot loot loot gank gank gank. There's the immersion. For that flying doesn't have anything to do with it.</div></div><hr />

Name and shame possibility to outlaw players for a bounty on their head.<br />
Basically player hunt. You can put wanted posters for players on billboards in similar as the quest boards are now in major cities and then anyone can take that task to hunt down said player.<br />
<br />
Let's see how long the ganking is still fun when 40 man raids are after singular ganker's head for a money or extra conquest points or other reward.<br />
<br />
This system would only be available if you're killed by a player outside of instanced zone, say BGs, arenas, etc..<br />
You can't bounty people who kill in pvp instances, only outdoors and open world killers.<br />
<br />
The bounty could be player decided or game generated, such as if a higher level ganks a much lower level the bounty would be bigger, if the pvp participants were evenly matched in level and say item level the bounty would be smaller. It wouldn't be an automatical system that each wanted request is automatically generated on kill, but the player who got ganked would need to report it to an npc, after which the game would put the bounty on the board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on the belf and draenei starting zones still not having flying, and the blue posts as to why not, it's pretty safe to say that adding flying to a zone that is not designed to have it is a difficult task. Therefore, if they ever planned on having flying, even a &quot;maybe&quot;, it seems pretty reasonable that they made flying an option from the very start, as they did with all the other BC zones. I also would bet that, if they did put in the work required for zones to have flying possible, they wouldn't throw all that work out by never allowing flying -- it would be wasted time. By contrast, if they planned to never have flying possible, they very likely skipped all the work involved in making it possible -- it would also have been wasted time. <br />
<br />
So, I think they know if they'll add flying ever, and they aren't telling us. To me, the smart move is to make flying an option for them, one that they can control and add when they feel it's warranted, so they don't have to spend the (apparently) large amount of time and effort to add flying to a zone that wasn't designed for it. My Archaeology achievements will wait until then.<br />
<br />
When are people going to stop pulling this bullshit out of their asses? There are plenty of items in the game already that makes you fly or glide into any place you want.</div></div><hr />

I was really, really looking forward to flying through Draenor. <br />
<br />
It's not like I'm &quot;threatening to unsub&quot; or anything like that, I'm just disappointed that I won't be able to do it for 6+ months, if ever. I've been flying in this game for so many years and now they've removed that and it rubs me the wrong way.</div></div><hr />

There's a few treasures left on my map, but the contents aren't GR so I don't care. I'm on a PvE server where the other faction is almost non-existent. No flying for me now just means I have to remember to start a flight path to Nagrand early so I'm not late for raid and run around mountains to go farm trees. It's probably why I essentially don't leave my garrison much on my main unless it's raid night. There's nothing left to interest me in running around little cliffs to go collect arbitrary items. <br />
<br />
It was fun leveling, it was even fun for awhile at 100 for a bit bc of treasures. I've ran outta stuff that made it fun now though and it's now just a time sink. Plus, somehow seeing people running around on dragons that can't fly looks ridiculous to me. But whatever. I'm not gonna quit over it. I just think it's dumb.</div></div><hr />

Worgen update requests are because people complained about how bad Fem worgen was during cata beta and they still went live that way. They got close in alpha then sorta ruined it by beta. Worgen is pretty darn bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And my answer is still the same it has been the last 3 years. I don't have 220 euros extra to spent on character transfers.<br />
3 years ago i had reasons to be on pvp realm, 3x irl friends on same realm and top 50 raiding guild. <br />
Now none of those reasons exist anymore, there's no reason to stay, but there's also no reason to start over 9,5 years work over 11 characters.<br />
I'm planning on starting number 12 for first horde toon as soon as the other 11 are level 100 and that will be on pve realm.<br />
But that still leaves my 4 mains and 6 alts on pvp realm and behind money gate.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry this is absolutely beyond ridiculous to complain about. You can fly on that mount in the VAST majority of the zones in the game. You can walk in the others. And again, they've never said there will be no flying in Draenor later on. For now, no. It's designed for flying so it's as simple as flipping a switch when they are ready to do so.<br />

Oh for god sake get over it already. Spending months and months and months and months pointlessly whining about it will take MORE of your time than lack of flying ever will.

How many people would buy WoD or the collector's edition if they knew they would never fly in WoD? I guarantee you a lot less than did in actuality. Flying has been a part of the game longer than death knights and dungeon finder, removing it is insane. Regardless of what happens with WoD repeating this insanity in future expansions will tank the sales. The fury is not done yet either. Blizzard is quite capable of doing 180s and has done it on numerous occasions when faced with subscription loss.</div></div><hr />

Where's your proof to back up your guarantee? Blizz is seeing and awful lot of people who love the change. Enough so that they haven't changed thus far. It will be added eventually, I'm sure. But I'm not seeing this attitude outside of a few very vocal &quot;squeaky&quot; wheels. Those who complain are always going to have higher representation on forums such as this. That's the nature of the beast and Blizz knows it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AngryLakitu</div><div class="date">2014-12-05, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How I got to this point I don't know because I normally realize I am reading the vitriol that is the comments section of a piece of content, slap myself, close the tab and move on with my day... but alas, I found my way to the bottom and there was this little box to leave a comment, so why the heck not?<br />
<br />
A lot of people complain about things, this I know to be true because I internets. Through my own experiences, I've come to realize that the majority of these people either like to complain for the sake of complaining or because they lack the capability to view things from another perspective.<br />
<br />
Because I can't do anything about the former (complaining for the sake of it), I thought to myself, &quot;Hey, why don't we try to entertain the fruitless venture that is giving a different perspective.&quot;<br />
<br />
I've found also that this group of complaining people remain ignorant of other positions because of an inflated self-worth or entitlement so what I say from here will be lost on most, but maybe it'll resonate with someone. I'll keep it brief where I can:<br />
<br />
I'm loving WoD. A lot. I haven't run out of things to do and in fact the opposite is happening: every day I come across something new to do. Two days ago I found out that in order to get the plans for Level 3 War Mill you need to level up 20 followers to 100. Now, this is a fact that years ago I would have known before the game even launched; things are different now, I'm different now. I knew that achievements were tied to level 3 plans, but I didn't get to looking up each one yet. So here I am with my new piece of knowledge -- half upset I didn't look it up earlier and may have hurt my progress, half excited about a new adventure. I spent the rest of that play session looking up followers on wowhead and hunting them down in game. These types of experiences have happened dozens of times already. I did a random quest and got the feather that launches you into the air... Man, has that been the best thing since sliced bread. Now I go out and adventure around just to see how far I can float or if I can find a glitch or bug spot for fun. Can I make it over that hill? I dunno, let's find out! I then spent the rest of the session floating around instead of gearing up in dungeons like I wanted, but I had a blast so I didn't care.<br />
<br />
Why am I telling you this stuff that you obviously don't care about because all you do is be the bestest there ever was and do mythic progression and complain about slight inconveniences like they are the worst thing evar because doing 10% less deeps than your best friend is making you feel incompetent and it's totally the classes fault?!<br />
<br />
Perspective.<br />
<br />
I know this is the hardest thing to wrap your head around, but it's probably the most valuable thing you can have when you want to argue a position. That's right, I'm not imploring you not to complain or not to voice your discontent, but hoping you understand the extra impact perspective can have on your arguments. Do you hate that flying isn't in the game? That's fine, I get it. And it's because I get it that I can actually stand behind and agree with some of your arguments. It's not because they are universal truth and it's not because they are infalliable (which they most definitely aren't). I simply agree with you on some points while holding a different opinion because I can understand the perspective you come from that allows you to experience the upset feelings you are writing about.<br />
<br />
Trying to impose your opinion on someone will both never work and actually result in the opposite of what you want. Discussion boards like this are just a smattering of statements being thrown around with no real broader picture in mind when topics are discussed and stubbornness that the absolute truth is only what /you/ feel. I guarantee that if you started these flight/no-flight conversations from a mutual perspective, you'd have such greater conversations and develop your own reasonsing to an even stronger level that can actually be taken seriously by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
If you go to Blizzard and say, &quot;This thing about 'immurshon' is BS because I'm just sitting in my garrison. Totally unsubbing.&quot; they don't see that as you voting with your wallet like you are trying to impart. That isn't what you are doing. You are picking a single topic and claiming it the divine answer in a whining manner. Even the lists some people try to make and ask for answers to each topic is pointless, because you are reading them as specific points and counterpoints with no greater perspective of them as a collective.<br />
<br />
If you go to Blizzard and give a reasoned argument that has grown out of the /proper/ argumentative process and in doing so developed tightly your own ideas and thoughts to support it, you'll get more results because you won't be asking for flying to be added back in because the reasons the other side made are bad, you'll be asking for systems or changes to mitigate the negatives you are experiencing because of their design decision. You'll understand their perspective and build your arguments around those constraints which will hopefully cause them to rethink their position. &quot;So Draenor isn't made for flying, I get that. What about a somewhat frequent mission reward for gathering that is a charge based item giving you a speed boost as long as you have a node on your minimap? Probably combat implications there, so maybe you can't engage in combat while (or shortly after) it is active and lose the burst if you get hit by a player?&quot;. &quot;Could you create flying but with a ceiling to prevent it from hindering the treasures you have hidden?&quot; Sure, those are maybe not the best idea and certainly have flaws, but you've not only planted the seed of an idea they could actually use as feedback to get their creative juices flowing, but by doing so you inherently impart that you are upset or inconvenienced by no flying. Maybe it doesn't resolve ALL of your concerns or quite fully address what you want, but you came to a compromise/conclusion after pages of discussion stemming from a mutual interest in further refining /your own/ opinion instead of bashing someone elses.<br />
<br />
And look, you didn't have to say unsub or call someone else a name once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And by scrapped I mean it won't be in this expansion. Didn't they say they were getting them out in this expansion? I don't remember the exact quote.<br />
<br />
But at this point it seems like to me that they're focused on garrisons and raids, and refuse to add anything or do anything other. Which is fine I guess, I like both, but unless they're planning on getting the next expansion out before the end of next year I'm not sure why they seem to have to be cutting things left and right or putting them on the back burner for another expansion if they aren't in a rush. <br />
<br />
It's also kind of sad that even though I like garrisons, they seem to be scrapping all of these other features that could come to life during this expansion and live on as permanent fixtures versus the garrisons that they've said they want to keep in Draenor to this expansion. Maybe they're just expanding on them now to practice/expand for future implementations of a similar feature. Who knows.<br />

No flying because they wanted to put in stupid jumping puzzles like in Guild Wars 2 , that once done in that zone which can be all done in a few hours becomes point less to not having flying. <br />
<br />
The world is small they just put roadblocks and a mountain or a hole in the ground you got to go around to make the world look bigger than it is.<br />
<br />
No new BGs. Dungeons are ok not great not bad just ho hum.<br />
<br />
Its all been lack luster and not flying at 100 after you lvl 6 toons on the ground yeah I seen it ok big deal. Now give me my damn flying.<br />
<br />
Garrisons is just a phone App game and then tie professions to it was a bad idea. Send followers out wait 30 mins or 10 hours just like a App game ohh thats real good MMO'ish game play LOL lame.<br />

I all ready know 7 people who all ready quit playing it and rest of the guild who came back they gone again. It has not been fun at all compared to BC, WoTlK, MoP, Cata was still crap too but this is worse than Cata.<br />

&quot;No flying in Draenor in Patch 6.1; though there will be some flight path improvements&quot;<br />
<br />
Smart decision. Watch subscription numbers continue to increase if 6.1 has some fun raids. Most of the players I know, both in game and IRL, do not want flying in this expansion.<br />
<br />
That surely counts as a reliable statistical sample to predict subscriptions. I'm so happy you shared this with us.</div></div><hr />

Flight paths suck because if I fly over something I see and want then I have to wait for the damn flight to end and back track. Right now I'm on my free game time from Blizz but I'm unsubbing until flying is back.</div></div><hr />

There is no lore why you can't fly anyways. Npcs can pop flying mounts. Also you have uncovered all flight points. Last but not least you can't even use any of your flying mounts you have collected over the many, many years. It just doesn't make sense. Once you are max level there is just no reason not to fly.</div></div><hr />

This pile of horse shit they call WoD is not MMO design. it's the worst aspects of other genre designs lazily tacked into WoW in the hopes they can increase their bottom line.<br />
Couple years ago the suits were wetting their pants at the amount of money Zynga and Facebook were making and decided &quot;Let's do that, make it so dev team and oh by the way we're cutting your budget by 20% to help pay for that stock buy out we just went through..&quot;<br />
This has to be the least argumented post I've read in a long time.<br />
<br />
Were you just looking for a random thread to complain in?<br />
<br />
What about the design is bad? Are the dungeons too hard? Didn't you get enough free epics? If you're just here to complain just because you feel like it, don't bother posting.</div></div><hr />

So you sit in your Garrisons because you can not fly?Ok. So lets say you get to fly,then you will be out of your Garrisons?Doing what exactly?All the things you can possibly do, you can do now perfectly without flying.So I dont understand, what exactly you are so desperately waiting for?What is it? If you can do things without flying, but you choose not to, because it will take 5 more minutes of your precious time, you are just lazy to begin with. Its not like you dont have access to some content because you cant fly.</div></div><hr />

Or when the subs dropped in MoP? Oh wait...they weren't the cause for the drops, not did it stop the peak to 10 mill. I wonder what that means. Hint: Flying does not effect subs in any way, shape or form.<br />
<br />
I leveled my first toon to 100 and enjoyed the content. That being said I haven't been back since because I want/need to level my alts so I can get them to end game and use their professions. However, I'm not running through all this crap again. I absolutely despise running through mob loaded zones getting knocked off my mount constantly having to fight things that don't help anything except to waste my time. Yes, my subscription is one of those that will be lost due to lack of flying. Been off the game for a couple months now and won't return until I see a &quot;Flying ability enable for Draenor&quot; patch note.<br />

You sound like the liberals that want everyone to stop drinking large sodas because it makes some people fat. Blizzard needs to protect us from ourselves because we might miss a few pixels they wanted us to see! Get real. Nobody forces you to fly but the rest of us want the option. I'm voting with my wallet. I'll bet that people like you won't quit the game if they DO add flying but I can guarantee that some will quit due to it not being offered!</div></div><hr />
