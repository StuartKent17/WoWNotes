Throughout the discussions regarding Azerite Armor, there’s been a lot of talk about how you earn Azerite pieces from Mythic+ dungeons. Players have told us – and we agree – that the process of earning Azerite Armor through Mythic+ feels overly based on luck, and that there isn’t enough control in the players’ hands. Even with our bad luck protection systems in place, the sheer number of potential Azerite pieces you can get from the weekly chest means that trying to get ahold of a specific piece feels hopeless.<br />
<br />
That’s a problem we want to solve, and give you some control over the Azerite gear you earn through Mythic+. So here’s what we’re working on for Tides of Vengeance:<br />
<br />
First, we’re adding a new (as yet unnamed) currency, which you’ll earn from your weekly Mythic+ chest as well as from scrapping (or disenchanting) epic-quality Azerite Armor. This currency is rewarded in addition to the item in the chest (which can no longer be an Azerite piece), and the amount you earn will scale up based on the highest level Keystone you’ve completed. For example, completing a level 10 Keystone will reward you with about three times as much as clearing a level 7. Similarly, scrapping higher-item-level Azerite pieces will give you significantly higher amounts of this currency than lower-level pieces.<br />
<br />
To spend that currency, we’re bringing back an old friend: Thaumaturge Vashreen. He’ll have two main types of items for sale. The first are caches that reward a random dungeon Azerite Armor piece for a given slot (helm, shoulders, or chest). They’ll be separated out by item level as well (at 355, 370, and 385), with higher item level caches requiring significantly more currency to purchase.<br />
<br />
But we recognize that with six or more options per slot, this may still not be enough control for high-end players who want to be able to work towards a specific piece that perfectly complements their build. Thus, Vashreen will also offer Item Level 385 versions of the specific dungeon Azerite Armor pieces for each class, sold at a premium.<br />
<br />
We’re still nailing down the exact numbers, but our goal for tuning this new currency is that you’ll be able to purchase one of the Azerite caches that lines up roughly with the item level of the gear you’re getting from your Mythic+ runs every two or three weeks, with the specific 385 pieces as long-term goals for top players.<br />
<br />
Overall, we believe that this change will improve things in a lot of different ways:<br />
<br />
Mythic+ players of all skill levels will now have a clear path to upgrading their Azerite slots High-end Mythic+ players will have a way to target specific Azerite pieces to optimize their setups Duplicate or unwanted Azerite pieces from other sources (such as raiding) now have some additional value The piece of gear in your weekly chest will have a more reliable item level <br />
<br />
You should see all of this hitting the Tides of Vengeance PTR sometime in the next week or so. We really do appreciate your feedback, and believe that this, in addition to the new traits and other improvements coming to the Azerite system in Tides of Vengeance, will help ease a lot of the concerns about Azerite Armor in Mythic+ and as a whole.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully blizz can carry their fixes in bfa into the expansion afterwards, so it can have less issues at launch.</div></div><hr />

I think they will be adding this system soon if they are mentioning current ilvls. That or they are using current ilvls to represent the rewards we will be getting in the future. though I imagine they'd just say normal, heroic, mythic ilvl equals.</div></div><hr />

They will probably treat like how they treated valor points in MoP and cata. Blizz will bump the ilvl up of the items from the vendor when M+ gets scaled up but reset whatever currency is used to 0 when that happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know that its a &quot;Small amount&quot;. They said the &quot;intention&quot; is that players can get a piece of azerite gear of &quot;appropriate&quot; item level every 2 to 3 weeks; but thats the RANDOM pieces of gear. The targeted SPECIFIC gear pieces they only said &quot;will be a long term goal for high mythic+ players&quot; so probably pretty unreachable for your average player.<br />
<br />
So random piece of maybe &quot;appropriate&quot; level azerite gear every 2 to 3 weeks, or a specific one probably 1.5-2 months, which is absurd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they have stated they don’t want us as players to be able to spam run dungeons to acquire azerite pieces. They want them to be available only via lockouts, such as raiding and the daily cache rewards. I’m not saying I agree with it, but that is their stance.</div></div><hr />

The item level of the tokens are not random. You either buy a 355, 370, or 385 token at increasing costs.</div></div><hr />

Because nerd, at the end of the day it’s still an MMO and RNG loot drops have always been a part of that.<br />
They are not just going to give players ways to BiS gear out their characters in a matter of weeks. Something you have to accept when playing an MMO is that character progression is something that is supposed to take time because it gives the player a sense of accomplishment. Getting things too quickly is bad for the game in business sense and player satisfaction experience. Seriously if you want to have everything now then go play a PtW phone app game</div></div><hr />

<br />
You think you do, but you don’t.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, the change is welcome, but it’s a band-aid on the Gaping wound that is Azerite. Sure they can fix the RNG behind acquiring Azerite gear, but the system is still garbage in terms of compelling and/or fun gameplay, consistency (cuz they keep tuning and retuning traits so fucking much), and being a better alternative to literally any system they had prior. Legendaries were better than this garbage and many people hated those, I was also happy to no longer have tier sets dictate what I was forced to equip in certain slots, but now we have that but worse. Blizzard didn’t just drop the ball on Azerite, they dropped it into a fucking industrial shredder, tried to get it back, lost a hand to the shredder and now the ball is unsalvageable and covered in hand meat so no one can stomach retrieving its pieces.<br />
<br />
What a colossal fuckup.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm, maybe they should just call it Azerite. Allowing you to use to it to craft things, switch traits and some other stuff, while sacrificing your HoA levels. That being said they should have made the system that replaced the already developed artifact weapon system, feel well... more developed. That's my primary issue at the moment, it is just missing depth and the 8.1 changes aren't revolutionary.</div></div><hr />

This feels like gated slow progression towards certain azerite pieces. You cannot loot Azerite in M+ and now it won't appear in M+ cache so most of the scraps will come from a weekly chest and few raid items you might be able to get a grip on. OR the high-end players will be forced to grind all m0 every week to get just a few scraps out of 340 azerite piece.</div></div><hr />

What sort of genius would save up to buy a token? Either you're not a cutting edge player and this will be a quick way to get decent item level azerite gear, or you are and you can finally target your BiS. Knowing you will definitely get your BiS chest/ helm in 3 weeks is a far, far better feeling than knowing you could get it at any time, and are just as likely to get any other item</div></div><hr />

Wow. It only took nearly five expansions before Blizzard realized that removing tokens and the related vendors was probably a bad thing even when they half-assed it with the legendaries at the very end of Legion when you could build up and target specific items only to take it away again and look even more clueless when they bring it back.<br />

But then now even with one of the most experienced raider at your disposal you couldn't get these systems right. More than fixing these issues find out how did you go wrong this badly in your decision making and make sure it doesn't happen again. Its a shame that after a decade of experience you would release an expansion that was widely criticized by your fans for all its flaws which could have been easily avoided upfront. You have some really great minds in your team and your fans deserve nothing but the best. I hope you would come back strongly with a better process and greater expansions in the future.</div></div><hr />

This feels like gated slow progression towards certain azerite pieces. You cannot loot Azerite in M+ and now it won't appear in M+ cache so most of the scraps will come from a weekly chest and few raid items you might be able to get a grip on. OR the high-end players will be forced to grind all m0 every week to get just a few scraps out of 340 azerite piece.<br />

Keep your Lootbox crap ideas out of this Game.<br />

Saying this as a person who waited 7 weeks to get 1 azerite out of the weekly cache, while some other people pulled 5 and wished they actually got a non-azerite for a change. <br />
<br />
Especially since they want to disincentivize repeated reforges and rather have people carry 3 sets of azerite different for each spec, the amount of stuff we're getting needs to have a steady flow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc7f933b7749</div><div class="date">2018-10-20, 12:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This system will mean the following for min/maxers before they burn out.<br />
- M0s will be spammed to scrap for currency<br />
- WQ offering epic Azerite prioritised<br />
- LFR, Normal, Heroic and Mythic will be done for Azerite to scrap for currency.<br />
- FH, A'tal and other keys based on Affixes for the week will be sort after even more so.<br />
<br />
There could be potential benefits to some guilds and the pugging community because quality (albeit potentially toxic) players will be actively involved in lower skilled content. However here is my issue with the so called &quot;fix&quot;, they should not have removed the chance of Azerite from the weekly cache. Instead the cache should have dropped what it had originally in the PTR, which was at least one item, with one guaranteed piece of Azerite. RNG or not, having a suboptimal 385 Azerite piece after an hour's work was a good trade compared to what is currently planned (3 weeks for a chance of a Random Azerite piece and longer for targeted pieces, of which potentially the 3 weeks they mention could require players to do ALL the aforementioned content).<br />
<br />
Lastly the fix disassociates the item from the dungeon itself. Yes, doing King's rest on say a +12 on a fortified week might be hell on earth, but I'd give it a go knowing full well there was a 30% chance that it could drop my BIS Azerite. Dungeons and their associated Azerite pieces would have more meaning when I complete them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO, the basic system should actually have been something like this:<br />
<br />
Every time you obtain a piece of Azerite Gear, your &quot;Azerite Resonance&quot; increases based on the ilvl and source of that piece. Resonance would be a stat on your Heart of Azeroth, which would gradually increase until it reaches 100%. Upon reaching 100% the Heart of Azeroth with resonate with nearby Azerite Armor to help you find it, giving you the option to spend it and bonus roll any source of Azerite Armor, giving you a guaranteed drop. Scrapping Azerite Gear would yield a small amount of Azerite Power.<br />
<br />
Additionally, I would give players a method to gain some sort of &quot;Titanic Essence&quot; which could be spent to manually Titanforge a piece of gear, obtained mainly by scrapping Titanforged gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why are they giving us 385 when mythic raiding quality will be around 430? <br />
<br />
Why do they have to include random chests even in this iteration? How can they not see that this RNG is killing their game?<br />
<br />
Because raid Azerite Gear will always be better within the raid, but depending on how they work out the traits, might not be as good outside of the raid.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">McFuu</div><div class="date">2018-10-20, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, they say it will take 3 weeks or so to earn enough &quot;currency&quot; to purchase items. But they also said that you can get the currency from scrapping epic quality gear, so... which is it? Does it take 3 weeks or does it take a couple of days of crushing mythics? Surely they can't mean running mythics daily for 3 weeks, that's ridiculous amounts of no-lifing and Blizz has gotten far past that.<br />
<br />
Also why do they keep putting up road blocks to us trading items? First it was changes to looting, then in Legion I noticed that if you traded an item you lost the xmog (not a big deal but it seems stupid), now people are going to actively avoid trading because scrapping offers currency.<br />
<br />
I mean... I only play this game because of my guild... but if they really start sucking some of the bigger enjoyment I get, giving people items, helping them out, teaching them the ropes, .... why not just make this single player?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. 3 weeks for an random item that is probably garbage or like 6 weeks for some BIS piece? Even legendaries had a better droprate at first.<br />
<br />
2. Nobody will ever trade loot again because you need to scrap your crap gear to buy new gear. Good thinking blizzard.<br />
<br />
3. What is going on that every fucking solution involves some super frustrating RNG. How can they still not get that rng sucks.<br />
<br />
I mean at least they are trying something but this is stupid.<br />
<br />
Make that currency drop at the end of every mythic+ dungeon and let it scale with the keystone level. For example: You do 8 level 10 Keys and have enough currency for one random item or like 12 Keys for a targeted one.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alopex Major</div><div class="date">2018-10-20, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cool, how about for people who don't do M+.</div></div><hr />

One piece. Every two to three weeks.<br />
<br />
Yeah, okay, that is totally making me resub, FOR SURE. Nothing like grinding dungeons for 3 weeks to get a chance at one item! Or, of course, grind for a month and pop the item you want, only to have the trait suddenly be nerfed the next week.<br />
<br />
How exactly ARE they hoping to balance this, anyway? On the one hand they're saying &quot;oh we want Azerite traits to be more equal&quot;, and on the other hand they're saying &quot;this one specific piece you want is worth grinding for 2-3 weeks&quot;. I can't really see how those two can be reconciled.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise people will run m+ 24/7 burning themselves out, then buy all 3 BIS items in a week or 2 and unsub because &quot;ran out of content&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. 3 weeks for an random item that is probably garbage or like 6 weeks for some BIS piece? Even legendaries had a better droprate at first. Prime case of short memory. I wish I could get my BIS leggo in 6 weeks early Legion. I spent whole raid tier having only Aggramar's Stride and Prydaz. That's at least 4 months if not more for 2 random leggos. <br />
<br />
World top players had 3-4 after clocking as much as 1,3k m+ runs. <br />
<br />
This system is much less luck / rng based, and more tied to completing your weekly chest on as high level as possible and good old timegating (which in this case is beneficial, because people doing similar content will have similar acquisition rate of gear instead wild variance based on luck, so no one will be &quot;left behind&quot; too much due to poor luck). <br />
<br />
You can also target a slot at lower price, already better than emissary garbage that always tends to give me item for that 1 slot that I already have highest azerite in, or if all your slots are in an acceptable state, hoard the currency for an even better item.</div></div><hr />

They want them to be available only via lockouts, such as raiding and the daily cache rewards. I’m not saying I agree with it, but that is their stance.<br />
<br />
Is that not what they are doing now? Spam run to the currency to buy the gear? Pretty much the same thing just an added middle man step. Don't like your piece? Then just run more M+ for the currency till you get it? <br />

Because nerd, at the end of the day it’s still an MMO and RNG loot drops have always been a part of that.<br />
They are not just going to give players ways to BiS gear out their characters in a matter of weeks. Something you have to accept when playing an MMO is that character progression is something that is supposed to take time because it gives the player a sense of accomplishment. Getting things too quickly is bad for the game in business sense and player satisfaction experience. Seriously if you want to have everything now then go play a PtW phone app game<br />

<br />
It is not to be bought with any currency, in-game or real. It is just that instead of getting ONE RANDOM CRAP IN M+ CACHE you could pick one from three available items, maybe even with one being a 100% chance of Azerite. So imagine you play a Warrior and you choose arms spec. You open your weekly chest and inside you get an actual CHOICE of a 2h weapon, jewelry piece and azerite shoulderpads.</div></div><hr />

except what you just said doesn't even apply to WoW with RNG titanforging. people doing world bosses and ending up with better trinkets than what you'd get from mythic uldir invalidates the whole thing, i honestly don't know why they dont make it so you can get azerite armor from M+. you can get everything else from them as well except 3 pieces of loot and you can EASILY gear up right now doing anything in game, raiding isnt king of the totem pole anymore. they just put an arbitrary lock on M+ just to string people along.</div></div><hr />

so we are down from 1 week to 2-3 weeks for 1 item. noone so far knows how long we need to get this &quot;premium&quot; item . i guess arround 4-5 weeks....they already said it will be for a much higher ammount of this currency....<br />
<br />
so right now its 1 more way from blizzard to keep us down , and let us grind like stupid morons for an azerith crapp random gear with random traits....<br />
<br />
since we are already forced to use the uldir azerith items, and since they sayed they wanted to implement more wways for players to get better azerith items, this solution is more than just bullshit .<br />
lets face it like it realy is : mojority of players runs key from 4-8 each week....they do NOT get azerith gear from m+ inis after all, but 1 for 100% from the chest the IL we dont mention atm, <br />
so from 8.1 its u dont get it from m+, u dont get it from your chests. but u can farm 2 weeks now for 1 item.because we made u farming stupid currency to be able to buy all 2 weeks 1 item of your wanted IL ......<br />
so i short iam asking myself why they do not just completly remove the weekly chests and just give us currency ... they wont, because than it will bascaly the same crapp like at cataclysm with the curency we got from NHC and HC inis and could buy items in OG......<br />
<br />
so yeah , i think all of those people who are happy now, and look forward to it. dosent even understand what kind of impact this changing will have on the game.<br />
right now blizzard is literarly every time they announce a change , fucking with the players...i still wait for the fact that e have to pay 50 bucks for our subs, instead of 13 ....</div></div><hr />

<br />
You just need to do the one +10 a week just like now to get the max cache of currency. Outside of that, depending on scrap values, you wanna do all raid difficulties, pvp, m+0s and emissaries that reward azerite to scrap for more currency. However depending on scrapping values obviously some of these activities are not gonna be worth your time, but i'd wager you prolly gonna be farming at least uldir HC, BoD normal/HC for more scrappies if your best parts are from dungeons, given that the vendor pieces scale beyond 385 since new gear from BoD will be much higher.</div></div><hr />

It's not even a proper trial either, just the Battle of Lordaeron and &quot;Hello, Welcome to Kul'tiras/Zandalar Harbo-&quot; FORCED LOCK, LOG OFF IN TEN, PLEASE BUY OUR GAME. Best bit was people are still getting DC'd and kicked out bugs that they still haven't fixed from Beta in the scenario. Otherwise you get three free days to play your other characters till Legion stuff. Oh and the trial character is able to unlock the Allied Races from Legion if you've done their respective grinds but your original characters can't.<br />
<br />
It's not even three free days. It's three (3) hours MAX per character and it works for eleven (11) characters. It's actually 33 hours of gameplay for Legion and older content, divided to 11 characters.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
This system will mean the following for min/maxers before they burn out.<br />
- M0s will be spammed to scrap for currency<br />
- WQ offering epic Azerite prioritised<br />
- LFR, Normal, Heroic and Mythic will be done for Azerite to scrap for currency.<br />
- FH, A'tal and other keys based on Affixes for the week will be sort after even more so.<br />
<br />
There could be potential benefits to some guilds and the pugging community because quality (albeit potentially toxic) players will be actively involved in lower skilled content. However here is my issue with the so called &quot;fix&quot;, they should not have removed the chance of Azerite from the weekly cache. Instead the cache should have dropped what it had originally in the PTR, which was at least one item, with one guaranteed piece of Azerite. RNG or not, having a suboptimal 385 Azerite piece after an hour's work was a good trade compared to what is currently planned (3 weeks for a chance of a Random Azerite piece and longer for targeted pieces, of which potentially the 3 weeks they mention could require players to do ALL the aforementioned content).<br />
<br />
Lastly the fix disassociates the item from the dungeon itself. Yes, doing King's rest on say a +12 on a fortified week might be hell on earth, but I'd give it a go knowing full well there was a 30% chance that it could drop my BIS Azerite. Dungeons and their associated Azerite pieces would have more meaning when I complete them.<br />
<br />
Learn to read:<br />
<br />
The currency will be dropping in the WEEKLY M+ cache. That means doing a single +10 will be better than 3 runs of +7 or 1000 +0's.<br />
<br />
Only thing that needs to be clarified is whether &quot;the amount you earn will scale up based on the highest level Keystone you’ve completed&quot; means completed IN TIME or just completed with no time goals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only problem is that until you spent your 9 weeks farming m+ for currency, you do not get any Azerite pieces from there. Due to the change, you can only get Azerite pieces of higher ilvl from raids, pvp, and with luck from warfronts. The only thing this change does is move the possible piece from the emissary chests to a vendor and lessen the rng on getting multiples for the wrong slots, nothing else. That is better than the current system, yes, but it does not address any of the other issues. <br />
Remember that Blizz explicitly wants us to farm multiple sets of Azerite gear for different specs/situations. Especially with them doubling down on spec-specific traits, the gap between someone running two DPS traits and someone running two healing traits on their dps gear will widen - and Blizz balances around the former. You are still just as screwed if you play multiple specs as you were before the change. Don't get me wrong, it is still better than before. However, we have to be careful to not make Blizz think that this change completely solved the issues. Unless we somehow get showered in currency.</div></div><hr />

Check WoW forum. Way too many people see this as an improvement (or at least they have now brighter view of this expansion). Saddest part is that a lot players actually think that they managed to point out Blizzard the problem, which is hilarious. It's just a part of Blizzards strategy ..</div></div><hr />

<br />
The currency will be dropping in the WEEKLY M+ cache. That means doing a single +10 will be better than 3 runs of +7 or 1000 +0's.<br />
<br />
Only thing that needs to be clarified is whether &quot;the amount you earn will scale up based on the highest level Keystone you’ve completed&quot; means completed IN TIME or just completed with no time goals.<br />
<br />
Why don't you learn to read? The blue post specifically states that currency required for a targeted piece to be a &quot;long term goal&quot; and the 2-3 week time line is for random Azerite pieces. In short if you want to reduce the amount of time it takes to get &quot;specific&quot; Azerite, you need to do one high key and collect epic level Azerite to scrap. This means for minmaxers only - you're wanting to do ALL the content including LFR. So do me a favour and take your own advice with the L2R.</div></div><hr />

Due to the change, you can only get Azerite pieces of higher ilvl from raids, pvp, and with luck from warfronts. <br />
<br />
And incursions, as finishing incursion rewards you with cache that drops only weapons and azerite pieces. Scales as emissary, so 370 ilvl. If they are like invasions, once per day, thats a lot of wpns/azerites.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">s0ul</div><div class="date">2018-10-20, 02:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow it's unfortunate how many of you lack reading comprehension skills. I don't know how you get through your daily lives without being ridiculed. <br />
<br />
<br />
That’s a problem we want to solve, and give you some control over the Azerite gear you earn through Mythic+.<br />
<br />
Okay so they completely disregarded the fact that Azerite acquisition overall (not just from Mythic+) is a problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
The first are caches that reward a random dungeon Azerite Armor piece for a given slot (helm, shoulders, or chest). They’ll be separated out by item level as well (at 355, 370, and 385), with higher item level caches requiring significantly more currency to purchase.<br />
<br />
They're giving players an illusion of a choice. It's basically the same fucking RNG infested shit. You roll a dice and hope you get one of the six pieces.<br />
<br />
<br />
But we recognize that with six or more options per slot, this may still not be enough control for high-end players who want to be able to work towards a specific piece that perfectly complements their build.<br />
<br />
Okay great! They know the problem. They know players want to target specific pieces.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vashreen will also offer Item Level 385 versions of the specific dungeon Azerite Armor pieces for each class, sold at a premium.<br />
<br />
Wait why can't players target 355 and 370 pieces? There's absolutely no reason why they shouldn't be able to do this, because again, the problem is players want more control and less RNG (as acknowledged by Blizzard).<br />
<br />
<br />
This currency is rewarded in addition to the item in the chest (which can no longer be an Azerite piece)<br />
<br />
Why was this necessary? No reasons given.<br />
<br />
Use your brains before you post &quot;FUCK YEAH!!!!&quot; or &quot;OMG blizzard listening,&quot; because it seems like most of you didn't even read their post. The currency should be a bonus and not something that should help with &quot;bad luck protection.&quot; Players will hog these pieces in raids and dungeons now instead of trading them to those who need it. There's just so much wrong with this. It's like all feedback fell on deaf ears, yet again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should never put a player in a position where he has to consider whether or not to trade loot because he can scrap said loot to get currency for better loot for himself.<br />
<br />
There's a few other issues with it that I'm not going to list but rather let you experience (!) (players that know, definitely know them), but overall; not a huge fan of this change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guess the next big feature in two expansions will be the reintroduction of reforging.<br />
<br />
They didn't realize anything other than that people are mad and they are bleeding subs and as usual they think the solution is some sort of PR band-aid that makes it look like they are giving the players something they want, when the reality of it will be not much better than what is in the game now. It's mostly oh yeah, a currency system sort of worked in legion for legandaries so let's do that now even though the two systems are nothing alike...<br />

Yes, and whether they pull off appropriate cost balance will determine if we can expect to be able to purchase an appropriate item level of gear compared to the mythics we run or not.

<br />
Not really, but atleast they dont exactly make it worse. Getting multiple azerite pieces still takes forever, reforging costs are unchanged and to actually experiment or collect multiple sets like they want us to, takes eternity still. At least you arent relied on cache RNG to get one specific piece but its still a long time to get enough currency to buy it.</div></div><hr />

You should be able to grind out your azerite pieces in a couple nights, not in several weeks. Thats whole damn problem with the system. If you are going after dungeon drops, they should drop. Not several weeks to get it. The whole weekly lock out of dungeon gear is trash. As the raid gear is still better.<br />

If you aren't raiding OR doing m+ then you dont need 355 or higher azerite items. Especially with outdoor content scaling to your Ilvl now, you are just making wqs harder with better gear. <br />
<br />
And everything pre Legion is soloable easily, and legion isn't meant to be done solo. Its not &quot;legacy&quot; content yet as blizz is under the delusion its still current.</div></div><hr />

you can get 355 azerite from emissarys or worldbosses and couple of weekly quests, like time walking or warfront quest for 370 lewts.And its not like normal mode raiding is hard either, dont need guild for that, tho might be slightly harder to get groups.<br />

Also doing low level M+ keys that are complete joke anyway to do with 340 ilvl, you can earn the new currency towards 355/370 caches. You arent completely out of loop, sure you cant get higher azerite from WQs but its not like you need to be clearing +15s or raid heroic/mythic to get beyond 340 azerites.</div></div><hr />

GTFO of here, Blizzard. Take a damn hint about the hate for these layers upon layers of RNG.</div></div><hr />

I'm actually for the reintroduction of Reforge.<br />
<br />
Yeah they actually said it after my comment, and they said only after 8.1 drop. but WQ 355 will drop token too.</div></div><hr />

Please don't. Every m+ chest I've opened has been a weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Per Blizz, 2-3 weeks of running M+ will give you enough to buy one of the 'random' caches.<br />
Yes, you can spend more and buy one of the 'premium' specific items for a higher cost, but wtf is that going to be ... 4-5 weeks of M+ farming?<br />
That sounds like a good deal to you?</div></div><hr />

Then your luck accounts for less than .001% of the playerbase. Sure that's made up, but you are BY FAR the minority in that regard.</div></div><hr />

Entitled. What a nice edgelord word.<br />
<br />
Who gives a fuck about mythic raiders anymore anyway. Mythic raiding isn't the current end game anyway.<br />
<br />
Keep lying to yourself inside your pleb m+ bubble. <br />
<br />
End game in wow has always had one name. Raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How about some love for us casual peeps, that like to do world quests? They upped the ilvl for emissary Azerite... I'm getting 355 cache on an alt that did no m+ or raiding so far, only things I did was timewalking, world bosses, warfront etc. casual content. I bought a BOE DMF trinket, rest of the items are from the aforementioned content. <br />
<br />
Also new Darkshore warfront is coming, so even more free gear inc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe this when i see it, even thou we would all love to push high keys to get high amount of resources, its not gonna happen.<br />
Im calling it now, its 99% certain that they will cap this at lvl 10. (or 15 if thats the new chest cap)...<br />
<br />
Im already dissapointed. God i hope blizzard surprises me and actually make it scale with your highest key done per week.</div></div><hr />

Players have told us – and we agree – that the process of earning Azerite Armor through Mythic+ feels overly based on luck, and that there isn’t enough control in the players’ hands.<br />
<br />
Geez, one would think these things would get tested BEFORE being rolled out</div></div><hr />

You know what's NOT great? Constantly complaining and offering nothing but toxicity towards the game and the community. But hey, you do you. You're pretty new to the game anyway</div></div><hr />

You're right. BFA is definitely my first expansion. I'm glad you made that comment, it just proves how near sighted you are. Yes, I agree there is a lot of negative comments floating around these boards because BFA is in a very poor state right now. But I guess according to your first post, we should all be satisfied with this small improvement. Even though, Blizzard's suggested improvement is still very RNG based (random caches). Or, you can farm currency and buy the azerite piece you want in let's say estimated 4-5 weeks. But hey, you do you bud.</div></div><hr />

The community literally never being happy is the problem. Blizzard owes us nothing. WOD was &quot;the worst expac ever&quot; according to forums, and it still had more subs than people think BFA does because of some dumb &quot;leak&quot; people took as the word of God over the devs saying they're NOT bleeding subs according to their own data.<br />
<br />
The community is toxic. Giving ACTUAL feedback is great. But that's not what is commonplace on these forums and official Blizzard forums.<br />
<br />
There was a video from Wowcrendor the other day that pretty much nailed it. People have been saying the same thing since 05/06. WoW is dead/dying. This sucks that sucks. Rep grind sucks etc etc. This game is clearly not for those people or everyone.<br />
<br />
If you have nothing constructive to offer just don't say anything.<br />
<br />
I'd say you're near sighted too but since BFA is all you've ever seen you can't see anything else past or present.</div></div><hr />

1. I have no idea what their sub #'s are &amp; if they're worst than WOD. Common sense tells me Blizzard would never admit they're bleeding subs...why would you think they would admit something like that? A lot of people are unhappy with the game, I wouldn't be surprised if sub #'s have been falling dramatically. <br />
2. I can see your point about not saying anything constructive, that doesn't help anyone - but the fact is, people have told Blizzard what is wrong with azerite armor, people aren't just using a blanket statement of 'azerite armor sucks'. They have left Blizzard constructive feedback as to why a lot of players don't like it. This is why a lot of people still aren't happy with this 'azerite armor improvement' Blizzard will be implementing because it's still very RNG based and if you want to target a piece specifically, it will probably take upwards of 2 months to get. <br />
3. I was being sarcastic, BFA is not my first expansion.</div></div><hr />
