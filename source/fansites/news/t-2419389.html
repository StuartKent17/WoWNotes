<br />
Greetings heroes, I am community manager Brandy Camel, also known as Nevalistis.<br />
On behalf of the Diablo team welcome back to Sanctuary for our newest season.<br />
<br />
For those of you still rocking your heroes in Reaper of Souls, you might have noticed we did something a little bit different for Season 14:Themed Seasons.<br />
<br />
The Season of Greed is our first Themed Season and we plan to explore additional themes in the future. If you'd like to know more, click the link in the video description below.<br />
<br />
We'd also like to let you know that the forges here at Blizzard are burning hot. And we have multiple Diablo projects in the works. Some of them are going to take longer than others. But... we may have some things to show you later this year.<br />
<br />
We hope you stay tuned, while we work to bring these Diablo experiences to life.<br />
<br />
None of this would be possible without the support that you have shown us for over 20 years. So whether you first joined us in D3 or you are a seasoned veteran, thank you.<br />
<br />
Diablo is, and always will be, part of Blizzard's identity, and we can't wait for the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if that is true. Why did they go into maintanance mode and hardly done jack shit to keep players in d3 if they knew something new was coming to it. Shareholders first. To make them happy they need to sell a lot of copies. You aren't selling a lot of copies to a dead game. If they knew a expansion was coming. They would do what they could to keep as many as possible playing. Instead of basically just giving up on the game like they have done</div></div><hr />

<br />
Development takes time and resources. Resources spent on new content to current-state D3 better suited towards future state D3 (like a new expac) or D4.<br />
<br />
If you look at a timeline of D3, it makes sense:<br />
<br />
Release was what, 2012?<br />
Reaper of Souls was 2014?<br />
Rise of Necromancer 2017?<br />
New expansion (or new game) 2019</div></div><hr />

<br />
Short Term : <br />
<br />
Announcement at Blizzcon : Either DLC Hero for D3 or Diablo (1 or 2, but not both) Remaster, with the new version (minus graphical update, just the software changes) coming Free to Battle.net. <br />
<br />
I'm was expecting Warcraft III remastered first, as they've been patching it in the same way they did with Starcraft before announcing the remaster, while we've seen nothing for D1/D2. This makes me think it has to be a DLC Hero. <br />
<br />
It could also be the console version coming to Nintendo Switch. <br />
<br />
Long Term : D4. 1 to 3 years/Blizzcons away from seeing anything out of that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An open world Diablo seems likely to me.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of fans expected an open world in Diablo 3 already instead of zoning between small maps.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I am afraid that they are not going to increase the complexity of build paths to be more like Diablo 2 or Path of Exile.<br />
<br />
Dumbing down character builds is something Blizzard unfortunately is enforcing in all their games.<br />
<br />
I have high hopes for the atmosphere of the game though, they can't possibly fail to capture the gory, dark, gothic, demonic style this time can they? After all the backlash they got for Diablo 3.</div></div><hr />

And are you dense? They started to recruit for an unknown diablo project in 2013, that is 5 years ago. The last year there has been tons of job listings for diablo. WoW Expansions are announced a full year in advance.<br />

Exactly. Necro expac felt like a small sub-team anyway, was not a full on xpac like RoS.</div></div><hr />

A true RoS sized xpac.<br />
<br />
IMO this is way too late in the game to do that. As much as I love Diablo 3, I could not see myself playing through another expansion worth of content this late into the game, even if it's a stepping stone towards a new game. I'm even starting to tire of waiting for a Druid (or any) class addition. Seasons just aren't cutting it.<br />
<br />
D2 remaster is where I think the content is headed.</div></div><hr />

An just what have they announced hot shot? Absolutely nothing. I'm sure it's coming but to expect a release next year is ridiculous.<br />

It's not like it went anywhere... You can still install and play Diablo 2 today. You don't need to have been born before a certain time to enjoy or understand Diablo 2.<br />
<br />
Also LoD came out in 2001, if she is 27, she was 10 when the expansion launched, and it was a successful and popular games for many years following the release. I was younger than she was when I first played Diablo and WarCraft 2.<br />
<br />
Also, the community manager is a community manager, not a game director. All she will say is what she's been told to say.</div></div><hr />

Necro pack was more than likely salvaged assets from a scrapped expansion. It was ready enough to just put it in a pack and release as is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's being outclassed does not mean it is a bad game. I for one, preffer the casual grind of diablo 3 and good animations and fluidity is also good for my eyes. <br />
<br />
Being second does not mean you are shit</div></div><hr />

I fucking agree.<br />
The game does not only look worse than Diablo 3. It also has innacurate targeting. I was so frustrated trying to target monsters.<br />
But yeah, Asian F2P horde will zerg everything making it popular, regardless of its quality.</div></div><hr />

In any event, this is all definitely good news, no matter what it is. Its been a long time since they asked us to get hyped about diablo. They would not do that for just a new character class i dont think. I would be pretty happy with a D3 switch port and a D2 remaster. Would be thrilled with a D4 announcement</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) There are multiple projects in the works.<br />
b) They'll make an announcement later on in the year, i.e. at BlizzCon.<br />
c) The community will be happy.<br />
<br />
My impressions:<br />
<br />
a) An expansion is, at this point, unlikely.<br />
b) They'll release multiple packs while we wait on the new project, e.g. a druid pack, new maps, new acts, etc.<br />
c) The major announcement will be Diablo IV or, if we're lucky, a Diablo MMO-RPG.<br />
<br />
P.S. Diablo I and II Remastered seems unlikely.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard released a video letting the community know that there may be a Diablo announcement later this year. <br />
<br />

<br />
Greetings heroes, I am community manager Brandy Camel, also known as Nevalistis.<br />
On behalf of the Diablo team welcome back to Sanctuary for our newest season.<br />
<br />
For those of you still rocking your heroes in Reaper of Souls, you might have noticed we did something a little bit different for Season 14:Themed Seasons.<br />
<br />
The Season of Greed is our first Themed Season and we plan to explore additional themes in the future. If you'd like to know more, click the link in the video description below.<br />
<br />
We'd also like to let you know that the forges here at Blizzard are burning hot. And we have multiple Diablo projects in the works. Some of them are going to take longer than others. But... we may have some things to show you later this year.<br />
<br />
We hope you stay tuned, while we work to bring these Diablo experiences to life.<br />
<br />
None of this would be possible without the support that you have shown us for over 20 years. So whether you first joined us in D3 or you are a seasoned veteran, thank you.<br />
<br />
Diablo is, and always will be, part of Blizzard's identity, and we can't wait for the future. <br />
´<br />
inb4 a Battle Royal game set in Diablo Universe :(</div></div><hr />

100 players jump from the heavens and have to fight to the deat....wait I feel like this has already been done. Hm, anyway, you have to fight to the death and scour various landscapes for gear and items to help you throughout the game. The games are timed, and there is a death zone that will slowly close in to a final ending zone. Obviously this a rough idea, but I feel like it could really catch on if Blizzard put their minds to it. But seriously, imagine the how awful this would be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both D3 and WoW stopped having talents trees (whether that is good or not is up to the player to decide) because blizzard at its core decided the old talent trees were not fun anymore and became obsolete.<br />
<br />
But I was thinking about this the other day while playing WoW, these games stopped being RPGs anymore, I remember in D2 being able to place points into intellect, stamina and so on, becoming different from my friends with the same class, also picking my talents on my tree.<br />
<br />
Now? we all have the same stats, spells, all that change is the gear that eventually you will have the same, most &quot;choices&quot; are 1 or 2 talents you swap here and there that is it! I even read about Blizzard blocking gear swap in mythic dungeons now so...<br />
<br />
Where is the RPG element to these games? Why should I get excited about a new D3 class/expa or D4 ? there is really nothing they can give me other than new enemy models and maybe spells.<br />
<br />
Thinking about abilities another thing I hate about WoW recently and Blizzard not giving you new abilities but instead taking them and giving them back each expansion... I mean cmon...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most likely is a Witcher type Diablo game - and I'll buy it. <br />
<br />
Diable 1 remake is guaranteed - and we may get a release date. D2 remake would also be VERY cool, and I would buy it, after playing D2 to death (4 copies of the game plus expansion, for mule accounts.)(And I want a ZOD, damn it) <br />
<br />
Mobile platforms for D1 &amp; 2, for sure. <br />
<br />
D3? New class, maybe. Full expansion, unlikely, as the D3 team is too small. They scrapped the expansion they had planned, and have been dribbling out bits and pieces of it over time, with the new map areas and mobs. A new class is doable tho, so I would not be shocked if they dropped a druid class. <br />
<br />
Overall, what I'm getting from this is they had hoped to announce the new project at Blizzcon, as an almost finished thing, beta starting soon, blah blah blah, but it's delayed, so they're gonna throw some things out there to keep people interested. Which is fine, it's better than nothing, like in the past. They've been saying they're still committed to the franchise for years and then ignore it in their events. They really need to get their PR game in gear, they make rookie mistakes, for a company of their size and experience. D3 is one of the most successful video games in history, and should be treated with more respect, but they've let it grow moldy on the shelf because they go spastic on the shiny-of-the-moment. Morhaime needs new blood in his PR team, it's just dumb at this point.</div></div><hr />

Well, interesting is, that now you can download Diablo 2 client through battle.net what wasn't possible days ago. We have no idea if it is Diablo 2 remaster or just Diablo 2 integration into new battle.net, but If I could bet, I would bet on Diablo 2 remaster.

Well, interesting is, that now you can download Diablo 2 client through battle.net what wasn't possible days ago. We have no idea if it is Diablo 2 remaster or just Diablo 2 integration into new battle.net, but If I could bet, I would bet on Diablo 2 remaster. Their legacy team has to be doing something.. so maybe this? <br />
<br />
Here is the link <br />
The link they posted is as follows: https://battle.net/download/getInstallerForGame?os=win&amp;locale=enUS&amp;version=PTR&amp;gameProgram=DIABLO_2<br />
<br />
Doesn't look like any new Battle.net integration is there, yet. D2 is still played, the servers are up and running, and they still maintain and patch the game - taking it off the old system and putting it onto the new one will be a big deal when it happens, so an announcement of that would need to happen. But yeah, interesting change. I registered one copy of D2 and LOD back in 2010 (according to the launcher), but I couldn't download the installer. <br />
<br />
Just downloaded the game, it's running (!!!!!!) (I thought it didn't run in Windows 10), even though Windows Defender thinks it's a virus. <br />
<br />
Time to play some D2!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, PoE feels pretty similar to D2, but that's not necessarily a good thing in every aspect. What I love about D3 are the graphics and the UI, PoE murders my hands after a while with the lack of customization. D3 is still a lot more polished in many systems compared to PoE.</div></div><hr />

They've recently listed a whole bunch of job openings (https://careers.blizzard.com/en-us/openings) for an unannouned Diablo project. From the job listings, which include a variety of entry level to senior positions for artists, engineers, and even a creative director, you can infer that it's a AAA PC game that will support DX11. At the very least it will have dungeons, as they are hiring dungeon and environment artists.<br />
<br />
The wording in all of the listings very much suggests a traditional Diablo gameplay experience: killing monsters and getting loot in a dark, gothic world. The rigging job suggests that characters will have complex facial rigging, which suggests a fairly high level of detail, and IMO may mean that it won't simply be a top down isometric game, or at the very least will have in-engine cutscenes or talking heads.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They've also got a bunch of job openings for a seperate unannounced AAA mobile game built in Unity 3D that involves &quot;a diverse range of characters and creatures,&quot; &quot;3D game environments,&quot; &quot;quests,&quot; &quot;regular content updates,&quot; and &quot;player progression.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
They're also also hiring people with experience developing 1st/3rd person action games for AAA PC or next-gen console games to work on unannounced project(s) for their incubation team(s).</div></div><hr />

Like, to be totally honest, that game is pretty much as perfect as it can get without completly remaking it and i think a new RoS type expansion could drown the game in features.<br />
<br />
So a D4 would make most sense, but its not the world is hungering for that, D3 is still fresh for people and it has a surprising amount of playerbase during each Season, so what would D4 add?<br />
<br />
In the end, while i love the Diablo IP, i can't really see what they should be making that people are actually looking for? Other than ofcourse a D2 remaster, but that is kind of a boring announcement xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's simply too much power creep. If they did another D3 expansion, you won't be replacing your level 70 gear with level 80 rares or even level 80 legendaries. You will only be replacing them with the same level 80 legendaries. Most meta builds get around 20,000% bonus damage from set bonuses and other synergies. So if you wanted people to replace their 70 gear with 80 rares and have it actually be an upgrade overall, you would need rares to have around 200,000 main stat. Paragon adds to this issue as well.<br />
<br />
That numbers bloat adds another problem. Lag. In top end play all the numbers already can cause lag, especially in 4 player. Amp up everyone's numbers by 20,000% and the game will be unplayable due to lag.<br />
<br />
They could do a stat squish, but that begs the question, why would you do a stat squish and expansion when you could just do patch content? Everything in D3 scales to your level, so it's not like in wow where you still get stronger relative to older content.<br />
<br />
A D3 expansion simply makes no sense. I bet we're getting D4 and D2 Remaster.</div></div><hr />

Diablo RTS. Why? Because Starcraft is done for now, there is a hole in the RTS development, and the Warcraft IP is doing other things. Diablo has nothing going on and it gives them an opportunity to flesh out the world (how they did War 3) and do a different approach to their RTS games.<br />
<br />
If not that then a Diablo VR game, because some of their heads have been quotes saying they are working on big things with VR and horror/scary games work well in VR.</div></div><hr />

On-topic: I see a lot of people asking for a D2 remaster and I gotta say I'd be 110% on-board with that. As stated above, that game took up a very, very large part of my youth.

Ya honestly I want a War 3 remaster over D2 remaster... Not so say the people who want that shouldn't get it, but I have been hankering for some Warcraft RTS action way longer then the Diablo fans have been without an update to their RPG... I do wonder how much work it would be to remake everything, the sprite work on that will be monumental... They have just as many if not more sprites in D2 then in SC1, and they are also a lot bigger as well, then comes all the item sprites...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This here. Absolute truth. I would bet you 100$ the devs on Diablo are super passionate guys being muzzled by stack holders requirements from above. When they released the D1 thingy in D3, you saw how proud they were and everyone hated the patch. Heck, they even said out loud they had to work on their own time to do it.<br />
<br />
If they somehow manage to release something &quot;à la&quot; Hearthstone that brings millions of players back and satisfies the shareholders, they would unlock again the infinite dev money well. I would even go as far as say that the only thing keeping the Diablo franchise alive may be the fact that the original Blizzard guys are still over there in key roles in Blizzard Entertainment.

<br />
Another XPac with additional content is the immediate news. Or to say, in the coming months.<br />
Diablo 4 is the &quot;will take a little more time&quot; news.<br />
<br />
That said, I would not be surprised to see HD overhauls and forward platforming of Diablo and/or Diablo 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's time.<br />
Almost everything apart from story continuation can be done within the current game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ragedaug</div><div class="date">2018-08-09, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This here. Absolute truth. I would bet you 100$ the devs on Diablo are super passionate guys being muzzled by stack holders requirements from above. When they released the D1 thingy in D3, you saw how proud they were and everyone hated the patch. Heck, they even said out loud they had to work on their own time to do it.<br />
<br />
If they somehow manage to release something &quot;à la&quot; Hearthstone that brings millions of players back and satisfies the shareholders, they would unlock again the infinite dev money well. I would even go as far as say that the only thing keeping the Diablo franchise alive may be the fact that the original Blizzard guys are still over there in key roles in Blizzard Entertainment. I really hope I'm wrong though as this would look grim for them...<br />
<br />
The &quot;dev&quot; money comes from finding a way to monetize it. Hearthstone and HotS get constant updates because the players are constantly paying into it. Currently Diablo primarily has XPacs and new iterations to fund the franchise. so I wouldn't expect to see a lot of content outside those two requirements. That said, it behooves them to create the new content if players show they are willing to pay for it when it's available.</div></div><hr />

No, it really can't.</div></div><hr />

Are you talking new expansions? If not, how do you think it will be funded?</div></div><hr />

This too is my stance. <br />
<br />
Then again, I don't even like like Diablo 3 and I have all 3 plats for the game on playstation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like many who played the old Wolfenstein and Doom games, when they were at that age.<br />
Hell, I played Ultima 6 on my brothers C64 when I was 10. It uses a text parser where you had to write what you wanted to ask NPCs and it wasn't like modern RPGs, where you can skip the text and run from quest marker to quest marker. Also played it in English, which I just started learning in school back then... (dictionaries ftw! ^^)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mass Pandemic</div><div class="date">2018-08-13, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">if that is true. Why did they go into maintanance mode and hardly done jack shit to keep players in d3 if they knew something new was coming to it. Shareholders first. To make them happy they need to sell a lot of copies. You aren't selling a lot of copies to a dead game. If they knew a expansion was coming. They would do what they could to keep as many as possible playing. Instead of basically just giving up on the game like they have done<br />
<br />
<br />
Because i imagine they didn't think it was going to take as long as they possibly do now. I've been watching their job openings on their website to see what they've been up to when im bored and if i were to guess it seems they might be re-writing a new engine for diablo which will take quite a while. Diablo 3 looked dated on release , sure they did some cool tricks with the scenes in the back and stuff but i know want the game to look good if my computer can handle it while still keeping it acessible to the people with lower end computers as well. Thats always been blizz's thing but tech has moved ahead so much recently they can do much more. Another thing as well is that diablo besides its expansions dont bring in any money for blizzard like the other games do which is more than likely another factor. Overwatch has their lootboxes , wow has sub fee and shop (cash cow), hearthstone has card packs to buy etc diablo is a one time purchase for everything they release for it.</div></div><hr />
