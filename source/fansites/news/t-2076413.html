Broken Isles Pathfinder Rank 1 now properly displays the amount of the mounted speed increase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Developers’ Notes: As we discussed last week, we’ve been gathering a massive amount of data based on how each spec has been performing in this first week of raids and Mythic Keystone dungeons, so that we can make a number of tuning changes with next week’s realm maintenance. The overall goal of these changes is to buff up some underperforming specs while also reining in a couple of over-performers, without dramatically changing anyone’s playstyle or causing them to feel as though the spec they chose to focus on became the “wrong choice.”<br />
<br />
All of these class changes will be applied during the next scheduled weekly maintenance period in each region. Note that there are also a number of PvP-specific changes, which are noted separately below.<br />

Fel Mastery (Talent) damage bonus to Fel Rush reduced to 30%.<br />
Bloodlet (Talent) now deals 100% of initial Throw Glaive damage.<br />

Vengeance<br />
<br />
Mastery now provides 50% less damage reduction per point.<br />
Demon Spikes damage reduction increased to 20%.<br />
<br />
Note: Gearing heavily for Mastery was allowing Vengeance Demon Hunters to reach excessively high levels of Physical damage reduction. We’re reducing the top-end potential of this effect somewhat, and bringing up the baseline. This should also cause the value of Mastery to be more in line with other stats.<br />

Mind Sear damage and Insanity generation increased by 50%.<br />
Voidform stacks no longer increase while Dispersion and Void Torrent are active.<br />
<br />
Note: These abilities prevent Insanity drain from increasing while active, which effectively reduces the Insanity drain for the entire remainder the current Voidform. This was proving to be too powerful, so we’re now making sure that the damage bonus and Insanity drain from Voidform remain in sync.<br />
<br />
The benefit of Mass Hysteria (Artifact Trait) is now capped at 100%.<br />
<br />
Note: We want it to be rewarding when you’re able to maintain Surrender to Madness for an extremely long time, but the amount of damage this trait was contributing in those circumstances was excessive.<br />

Fixed a bug that gave offhand special attacks a 100% chance to activate Windfury while Doom Winds was active.<br />
Windfury activation chance increased to 20%.<br />
<br />
Note: We’re fixing a bug that added multiple extra Windfury procs to each activation of Doom Winds, but adding some Windfury procs back by increasing the baseline activation chance. This should also improve Maelstrom generation outside of Doom Winds.<br />

The Arcway<br />
<br />
Enemy Forces will remain in The Arcway after players have defeated Advisor Vandros.<br />
Tome of Hex: Spider should now only drop for Shaman when defeating Nal'tira.<br />
<br />
Maw of Souls<br />
<br />
Players should no longer become stuck inside the cages they’re placed in after defeating Ymiron.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Damage from Potion of the Old War and Potion of Deadly Grace reduced by 33%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Previously, we significantly buffed the damage of these potions, but then discovered some bugs that were significantly reducing their effective damage. Now that those bugs have been fixed, their damage contribution is much too high. They should still feel very rewarding to use, but we’re bringing them back down to Earth a little.<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that was causing Balance Druids to sometimes engage enemies from unintended great distances with damaging trinket procs.<br />
The Grove Darkener's Treads should now switch from Intellect to Agility based on your spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
It should now be possible to reach skill 800 in Blacksmithing.<br />
Cooking<br />
<br />
Rank 1 of Hearty Feast should now reward one feast instead of five. Subsequent ranks reward a cost reduction, rather than additional food.<br />
Demon Hunters should now get appropriate stats from feasts and other similar sources of buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
In the Withered Army Training scenario, it should be less likely for Leystalker Dro to be hiding somewhere that he wouldn't normally be encountered by clearing the room.<br />
A new Archaeology Quests aura is now displayed while you’re on an Archaeology quest in your current zone.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: This is to make sure you’re aware of how many days you have left to complete a large Archaeology project before it expires. We’re investigating ways to provide this in the quest tracker and quest log.<br />
<br />
Aodh Witherpetal will no longer become stuck during “DANGER: Aodh Witherpetal”.<br />
<br />

Tanks PvP Balance<br />
We lost 10% total dmg, had our PvP templates dmg lowered on top of that and now we also take 25% more dmg.<br />
<br />
All three of these changes effect INSTANCED PvP where there was no possible way you could say with the lowered PvP template PLUS we do 15% less dmg to players already before these changes that this seems fair at all.<br />
Thanks for the post about this. We understand your concern. Tanks in PvP are a real design and balance challenge for us and it may take time for us to get it just right. Unlike other PvP games (Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm for example), tanks in World of Warcraft are not tuned or designed around tanking other players. World of Warcraft tanks are primarily designed to withstand the onslaught of raid bosses, which do considerably more damage than players. While tanks have a lot of active mitigation buttons, they also have a lot of passive mitigation and survivability. During beta, we applied a lot of spell multipliers to tank active mitigation abilities while leaving their passive mitigation alone for the most part. But this approach has a side effect that a tank's active mitigation buttons don't feel like they're doing anything in PvP. <br />
<br />
The 25% increased damage from players is our first attempt at decreasing tank passive mitigation in PvP. Consequently, we will be relaxing or removing many of the spell multipliers we've made to tank mitigation abilities. That is a change we'll be making alongside the class team's upcoming tuning changes.<br />
<br />
We're often asked, &quot;what is your vision for tanks in PvP?&quot; First, if you enjoy playing a tank, we want you to feel like you can provide value to your team in some way. But, we don't want that value to be &quot;I can never die.&quot; A tank should be harder to kill then a DPS, but not by a wide margin. Likewise, a tank should do less damage than a DPS (and preferably far less burst damage) but not damage you can simply ignore. We want a tank to be able to go into an arena with their friends, compete, have fun, and earn rewards. We're much more hesitant to say we want tanks to be viable in arenas at the highest level. However, in rated battlegrounds, we would very much like to see tanks at the highest level, not only as flag carriers or point defenders, but as target callers and frontline disruptors. We think that is a fun place for tanks to live in PvP.<br />
<br />
We don't think we've arrived at this vision by any means and it may take some time and iteration before we do. We appreciate your impassioned feedback and hope you'll continue to give PvP a try on your tank. Thanks!<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
CM Interaction<br />
TL;DR: Blizz, please talk to your players more.<br />
I think this is valid and understandable, at least for me. I would like to respond to couple of things here, though - just to share some understanding of my personal goals on the team and the broaden the perspective you may have of what I do on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
I think it's important to note that it's not my goal to keep my presence to a minimum, and, in fact, the opposite is my ultimate goal. I would love to see a world where I could muster responses to 50-75% of threads across the entirety of the World of Warcraft forums. I am not one to tread the fire and come back when things are already burnt down and in a state where they can't be repaired - I see myself more as one to run directly into the fire and hose it down from the inside out. I don't mind getting caught up in &quot;controversy&quot; and &quot;drama&quot; here (that's my job, after all), and I don't mind if forum goers hate responses I give or come to hate me even, but I do my best to try to share what I know, when I can, where I can.<br />
<br />
Of course that doesn't mean that people will always get the answers they want when they want it - which is the case of a lot of class balancing feedback at the moment. I did listen and read tons of posts and threads after poking my head into a few of the class forums. I didn't get a chance to follow up on any of the feedback, as I'm not personally aware of what changes are being made yet - but I did take the time to read the feedback and discuss it with members of my team and the development team here. <br />
<br />
----- Skip this part if you don't want to read about restaurants -----<br />
<br />
A bit of an aside/ramble for a bit, but it's interesting to think of game development and the customer-feedback loop as a restaurant. The Community team, as well as other teams like Customer Support, are in a more &quot;front of the house&quot; position. We are bringing you the menu, making sure everything is fine with your meal, and having conversations, both good and bad. It's also our job to move your feedback and concerns back to the kitchen and chefs (the development team and individual designers), and our hope there is that those conversations will ultimately lead to a better meal being served to you guys in the days following, once we are able to adjust to the feedback and find a way to better serve and present your meal.<br />
<br />
Game design isn't as simple as many may thing, though. You can't just add another ingredient to the dish without changing the entire dishes composition, and, sometimes, changing entirely what the dish is.<br />
<br />
While it is my goal to always come by your table and let you know some updates on your food, some changes do take a while to cook in the kitchen before they are delivered to the front of the house, and the bell rings for the dish to be taken to the table. We could always do things faster, and rush to implement more and more fixes and tuning, but sometimes we do need to slow down, observe, listen, respond, listen some more, and figure out exactly what needs to be done to improve the quality of our meals. <br />
<br />
That's where we are at right now. We are on the cusp of improving our meals, we've put out a lot of new choices onto the menu, and we about to push a new order out onto the window, but we are making sure it's delicious before we do.<br />
<br />
I'll stop talking about restaurants now, because it's making me hungry and I haven't really had a chance to eat today, but I hope visualizing this helps someone on these forums understand our roles here, and why it takes a bit longer than the customer may want to get something they want to eat.<br />
<br />
----- Okay I'm done rambling now -----<br />
<br />
Like OP said, in a sense there's nothing to be done about these things - sometimes you just have to wait. We will be here when we get more information on upcoming changes, you guys will know as soon as we do about what is being implemented.<br />
<br />
Aside from this, and using Lore's case as an example, we do like to drop in and have fun here. It's nice to be able to chat about things that aren't along the lines of &quot;balancing Destruction Warlocks who want to fly in the Broken Isles with 3 legendaries during Vanilla&quot;. I understand that these are huge topics, and there are a lot of players who feel strongly about them, but a personal conversation that doesn't touch these topics does not detract from them at all. I understand the frustration that comes when topics about &quot;coffee and tea&quot; gets a response over one about &quot;the state of retribution paladins&quot;, but, again, we do need to give our brains a break sometimes. ((As a note, it comes much, much easier to respond to threads about coffee and tea than it does to sit down and write out a long post like this, if that's not obvious))<br />
<br />
While this may be seen as a more &quot;junior&quot; responsibility, like you said, it is one of the more important roles in developing our community. Someone has to be down in the trenches, and someone has to wade into the bullet storm that can come from there. When I get home from the office, the first thing I do is open the forums. I try not to respond much after hours to avoid the wrath of my manager/HR, but even then I am still reading threads, following along, day-in and day-out. <br />
<br />
Now, I get what you're saying here is that you'd like me to come by and check in on you more often - and I can do that. But it is a double-edged sword. I know many of you would love for us to drop in and say &quot;Hey, thanks for the feedback, we're listening!&quot; over and over again. You may have seen my dropping on occasionally with those kind of responses already, but there is a method to the madness here and a reason every feedback thread doesn't get a response. Since I can't control the time it takes to get changes implemented, I do worry, though, that many of you will tire of a constant &quot;thanks, we're listening&quot; and we will end up in a place worse than when we started. <br />
<br />
I'll see what I can do with doing that bit more for now though, and I'll definitely be around a lot more going forward. I've only been handling this forum thing solely for a bit over a month now, so I'm still getting my feet wet and growing a bit into my own here. I hope you guys can come to learn to help me in the same way that I hope I can help you.<br />
<br />
It's going to be a crazy ride around here, but, as always, I'm happy to be on board.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Development is hard and takes time. Communication is hard and takes tact, a thick skin, and lots of alcohol. I am always here, and always listening. I'm looking forward to learning and growing more as I engage with you guys.

Wait for sims, but current talk is crows &gt; barrage for pure single-target, like Ursoc.<br />
<br />
Thankfully, not many fights are pure single target, so we can keep using barrage a decent amount and using it for ezpz bullseye stacks.</div></div><hr />

Focused Rage is the talent on which he spec is based on. It already got nerfed from 50% the week before.<br />
Arms is extraordinarily reliant on Tactician procs (resets CS, triggers Shattered Defenses, etc.), the impact of it is monumental on your dps - without them your're bottom. <br />
Arms was already very frustrating to play due to this rng factor. The proc rate and the general feeling was greatly improved by Exploit the Weakness and the bis relics are EtW relics. They just nerfed EtW to the ground while also scraping another 10% off FR. <br />
We were expecting nerfs but not like this. There were many things they could've done here to reduce the output of FR (like increasing baseline MS damage and decreasing FR stack bonus) but they chose the wrong direction by making the rng aspect even more terrible.</div></div><hr />

This right here! I mean, yes, arms may have been doing too much dmg, but making the RNG aspect SO much more brutal that we can almost guarantee we'll have CS on a 30s CD every time is horrible. Without CS we don't do dmg AT ALL! but Blizz seem to have overlooked that blaring fact. EtW was the only way I can tolerate arms, and I play arms mainly because fury is garbage. Without any changes to fury, and such hard nerfs to arms, wtf are we to do?<br />
<br />
Could they not just have tuned our numbers!? I mean, the FR nerf is warranted, I can see that, but not the EtW. No other spec has this or will ever have this kind of RNG. We are more dependent on it than fury warriors in WoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, you failed at your own goal at your first balance tune. I started laughing when I read that part after seeing what was done to Arms warrior. Arms DEFINETLEY feels like the wrong choice now. <br />
I'm usually not the one to cry, whine and moan at patch notes, but this one fucking insane! The Focused Rage nerf is ok, I get that one. Was even nerfed before, but it'll probably still be the go to talent. Making us never be able to reset Colossus Smash, experiencing the lvling process all over again is too much. Too much indeed. Exploit the Weakness was the one thing that made the spec work, so I guess that shows that the design for the spec was flawed in the first place.</div></div><hr />

There was nothing balanced in obliterating packs of mobs in Dungeons (seen some high end guilds do it) with a Demon Hunter. The packs died before they could melee the Tank and it basically turned M+5 and higher into an AoE fest.<br />
I knew they'd nerf it and AoE will be more balanced now. <br />

<br />
Of course! Arms did a bit too much dmg, I agree on that. But here's the thing:<br />
<br />
Arms don't do dmg without Colossus Smash. We just don't. We're balanced around it. And we rely on CS procs to do any kind of consistent dmg. Exploit the weakness was what made us work. Now, we are almost guaranteed to have the full CD of CS go between each CS, which is 30sec. Now, as I mentioned, we don't do dmg without CS seeing as we are balanced around that one ability. CS window lasting a whole 8sec, we'll be able to do dmg every 22 seconds. The rest we do nothing. <br />
Tune our numbers, the focused rage nerf is OK! Not the Exploit the Weakness one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not dramatic. Just spot on.<br />
<br />
Right... if you say so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vengeance got nerfed to 35% and Protection generates less rage from intercept and Shield Slam in these new patch notes. Ignore Pain relies on the amount of rage that the Warrior can generate so these are actually HUGE nerfs towards Ignore Pain as a whole since less rage = less ignoring of the pain.</div></div><hr />

There is never going to be a time in this game where Warrior is not overpowered ezmode imbalanced no skill required.<br />

I have two concerns here.<br />
<br />
First -- how did things get so bad that they needed such significant changes? Something seems very wrong here.<br />
<br />
Second -- I'm not particularly interested in a 50% buff one week, 25% nerf the next, 75% buff the next, 80% nerf the next. I don't want a rollercoaster. With how artifact knowledge is -- it's going to be very destructive to ask someone to swap a class in a few months if you nerf the fuck out of one or buff the fuck out of another.<br />

I do admit -- many of these were badly needed and I'm also shit at math so whether these are &quot;what's needed&quot; I'm uncertain.<br />

For ele shaman I know that my survivability can't compete with my demon hunter (havoc), warlock (afflic), or monk (ww).

My shaman is still only 106 though -- so my complaint is purely in the leveling realm.<br />

I've been very vocal about some things lately and perhaps a little more unfair than I should have -- but the last time I played this game when they swung big hammers like this it ended up very poorly for them and was very frustrating for the players.</div></div><hr />

It's a tiny insignificant amount of damage increase. They should have cut lit bolt cast time drastically which would have boosted damage considerably from lit bolt + maelstrom spending and it would have made Ele feel more dynamic and less like it's stuck in the mud.</div></div><hr />

Spinning Crane Kick (Mistweaver) damage reduced by 25%. What is the justification for this? Leveled As MW in beta and live and Spinning Crane kick actually makes killing mobs on world quest tolerable. Not like the mind numbing smite spam of Holy Priest which was one of the reasons I switched to MW. <br />
<br />
But I also see Holy Priest: Holy Nova damage was reduced by 16%. Not a happy camper as I am running my Priest though World Quest in case we need it but it is really too painfully slow to do so. Really wish they would give reasoning when nerfs are issued.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand this, I've not seen a single bad lock this expansion so far. Maybe my guild ones are just better than the average, but they always sit in the top 5 on some fights.<br />
<br />
Hell we even managed to make 4th best time in EU Mythic + Nelthation's Lair 7 and Maw of Souls 8 last night. Despite running one of the most unoptimized groups possible.<br />
<br />
Running 2 rogues, and a destro lock, with DH tank and Shammy healer. The lock did amazingly well, and even more so in Emerald Nightmare, and any other Mythic Plus.<br />
<br />
I really haven't seen these underperforming terrible warlocks yet.<br />

<br />
I'm one of the Outlaw rogues, and even with a 6 rolls and every cooldown the highest I can burst to is around 780K single target; it's only on trash packs we exceed a million. While the average is around 260-320K.<br />
<br />
You can also also click on the logs and check out the dmg. The Lock did really well.<br />
<br />
On average 10-30K behind one of the rogues; and it's worth noting the rogues' iLevels are 851 ( with legendary ), and 852 without.<br />
<br />
With these Warlock buffs we'll be pushing times even easier, and at higher Mythic Plus levels now.<br />
<br />
Also we're also 4th in the World of Neltharion's Lair lvl 7, so it's not that EU players sucks. If they did why are USA rankings worse :p</div></div><hr />

Warlock changes feel more like taking a sledgehammer to a problem when a scalpel is needed. Not that I'm complaining - buffs are nice - but most problems are related to core mechanics and not raw numbers. Flat damage buffs will not fix the classes most frustrating problems; Demonology's Demonic Empowerment spam and immobility, Affliction's perennially long ramp up time, or Destruction's finicky burst and boring-ass resource generation.<br />
<br />
Plus some of these buffs are fixing problems that don't exist. Affliction, for example, doesn't need to have Seed of Corruption buffed - it's AoE is already strong - and across-the-board damage buffs will make Destruction's already great cleave even better (instant cast RoF, however, is very nice).</div></div><hr />

I am really glad they did this and apologize to my insulting Blizzard remarks that they never get shit done. They actually came through this time in a fast pace.<br />
<br />
From my first look over it it seems they definitively hit the right tone with this balance update. We will see about numbers next week but I am positive.<br />

Really surprised that they didn't really nerf arms, because Arms is one of the strongest PvE speccs right now, but that is none of my business.</div></div><hr />

Grow up and accept this.<br />

Lol@ people thinking DHs were fine. Hillarious<br />
<br />
Do the maths, we're losing now with this simple nerf 50k+ DPS ST. In AoE we were king, in ST it's not because you weren't first that DH was overpower. You are simply bad if it's the case. Very good players are better (yeah not that much sure) in ST. Now, we're deeply in grave of ST.</div></div><hr />

Arms is extraordinarily reliant on Tactician procs (resets CS, triggers Shattered Defenses, etc.), the impact of it is monumental on your dps - without them your're bottom. <br />
Arms was already very frustrating to play due to this rng factor. The proc rate and the general feeling was greatly improved by Exploit the Weakness and the bis relics are EtW relics. They just nerfed EtW to the ground while also scraping another 10% off FR. <br />
We were expecting nerfs but not like this. There were many things they could've done here to reduce the output of FR (like increasing baseline MS damage and decreasing FR stack bonus) but they chose the wrong direction by making the rng aspect even more terrible.<br />
<br />
This exactly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They were not amazing at all.<br />
<br />
For example, in WoD only (2+ years), DK Frost was garbage for most of the xpac, took them almost the entire xpac to actually try to fix something. Unholy was never &quot;amazing&quot;, only doing well in a few specific bosses where necrotic plague was perfect for it's mechanics and Blood tank was ok.<br />
<br />
That was far from amazing for DKs.</div></div><hr />

Very few people kept playing BrM, I left it myself, for which I was extremely sad, but this new gameplay of the spec is pure and unadultered garbage.

Although it is true that our AoE DMG was insane (as well as monk's and they remained untouched) they nerfed both, our AoE and Single target DMG. I think they overreacted to the first raid logs. Gonna have to reroll class, 1 month worth for nothing ^^</div></div><hr />

Disc has been the superior choice in all circumstances for the last what, FIVE?, expansions? And I don't mean just &quot;superior&quot;; I mean DOMINANT in all situations, above all classes, in all fights, to the point where they were a must-have in raids. Give it some time on the disc priests.

I totally agree, like, end of WoD, i was mostly playing only my monk, and was pretty confident come legion i was going to main Brewmaster and WW as OS. Then the pre-patch came, and i thought exactly that. Brewmaster changed from a fun and versatille spec to this dull, weird and unfun thing we got now. I usually don't talk about this this way since it is my opinion and maybe other people out there loved this changes, but for what i can see i am not alone thinking this.<br />
<br />
I hope they realize almost noone play this spec now and do something, but after seing how lazy they are nerfing ALL tanks dps by 10% (like come on, they were not on the same levels for this. Its soo lazy), there is little hope for a once fun spec to make its return :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some classes received well deserved buffs and nerfs, but the tweaking points are often odd. Other classes that were flat underperforming received nothing and others that were already strong got even a buff on top. Taking Warlock as example: the buff was well deserved, however a 10% increase won't make Affliction viable. In addition the other two specs received an equally massive buff, but they were already quiet good. Now Warlock will be a top-ranking DPS machine, yet still no one will play Affliction because the other two specs are still massively better. The only explanation for this that I can think of is that Blizzard just has no clue what they are doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These nerfs are obviously intended towards people that have a legendary. The damage can indeed be Insane with the right gear and one of those (imagine in a few weeks 2) but... without a legendary... You're kinda fucked. <br />
<br />
The initial boost towards throw glaive is not bad. Thats a good amount of damage, but the dot is way less. This is OBVIOUSLY intended with the legendary: Throw glaive does a 50% increased damage for every ricochet. (which is 3 in total) But... only a few have that. <br />
<br />
Fel rush also. The legendary that boosts it with 5% for each target hit. Image a pack of 15+ mobs. Ding ding ding, that's insane damage. But again... only a few have that. <br />
<br />
The rest... I guess gear will bring it back and weapons that will go over 900 ilevel soon will make up for it to. Its just a shame that it has happened now. They had a LONG time for testing and now on live it suddenly strucks them that these changes have to be made... It would have been better if these values had been the initial values all along and no one would've cried. <br />
<br />
Also, speccing in a art trait and then that art trait being horribly burned down... That's not a nice feeling for most I am sure....</div></div><hr />

That doesn't seem to actually include the DK hotfixes (it does list DH, Mage, Warlock and Warrior). But yes, Frost is bad. The fact that it didn't move at all in numbers from the old sims was what made me check the hotfix list on the page. So assuming the 10% buff to everything actually adjusts damage by 10%... they are still around Elemental Shaman and BM Hunters on that list. Not much of an improvement.</div></div><hr />

Plus, I played all other classes at top level and let me be clear, to be at the top meter in ST as a DH, it's a lot harder than most other classes who can bring the DPS finger in the nose.<br />

Unfotunately, many naabs say &quot;OMG NERF NERF NERF&quot; because we're topping the DD meter if you're not resetting it each boss.

SP single target was insane for those that knew how to abuse the spec. You're posting that you unsubbed over some hotfixes that aren't even live yet and you had a DH and SP....and you call me a &quot;shit poster&quot; - is that the new kiddie insult these days? Seems you do like DH though since you specifically mentioned you had one for raids. <br />
<br />
If you're ignoring mechanics as a DPS then you're the typical idiot DPS who expects healers to do all the work keeping your dumbass alive through 100% avoidable damage. Might want to play the other roles before you assume all mechanics can be ignored because you obviously don't have a fucking clue what the tanks and heals have to deal with.</div></div><hr />

Well the Havoc was really OP when it comes to Aoe damage and I'm pretty sure 90% of havoc players will agree with me. Single target on the other hand is mediocre and I say still par with every class. But with this changed the ST dps might drop 10-15% and &quot;might&quot; fall behind on boss fights. The nerf on the Fury of the Illidari is a little to much at least compensate for CD reduction or some sort. Fel rush and throw glaive are reasonable. But nerfing all the 3 all together is a little bit too much. Those 3 abilities are part of both ST and AOE rotation. Maybe if they buff chaos damage on chaos strike then it might balance the nerf with those 3 abilities when it comes to ST damage.</div></div><hr />

Yes.. nerf vengeance.. one of the weaker tanks.. but don't nerf ignore pain... makes perfect sense.. wtf...<br />

<br />
<br />
Vengeance got nerfed to 35% and Protection generates less rage from intercept and Shield Slam in these new patch notes. Ignore Pain relies on the amount of rage that the Warrior can generate so these are actually HUGE nerfs towards Ignore Pain as a whole since less rage = less ignoring of the pain.<br />

<br />
I agree that the exploit the weakness nerf was the wrong way to go about it since it affects how the spec rotation feels rather than just the damage. No procs means no fun and no damage.<br />
<br />
Let's do the math tho. Say you spend 20 rage at .65% per point spent, that's a 13% chance to proc tactician. With EtW at old 30%, you get 20/3 more rage spent = 6 rage. So then 26 * .65 = 16.9%.<br />
<br />
Now with the new EtW at 9%, we get 20*.09 = 1.8 more rage. So 21.8 * .65 = 14.17%.<br />
<br />
So the chance was only reduced by about 2.7%, which sucks yeah, but it's not world shattering. Arms will still be good, just probably not top of the charts as much.</div></div><hr />

That not-so-subtle Enhance nerf though. Wow. &quot;Offhand can still fail during Doom Winds&quot;. Fuck you Blizzard. Why are you pushing people rely on auto-attack trackers to even use a major fucking cooldown. Meanwhile DPS Monks, DH, and Druids press a button and see amazing numbers with no effort.<br />
<br />
They also nerfed Prot's rage gen even when it's already fucking horrible and RNG-based. Just get rid of Focused Rage. It's a fucking stupid gimmick/crutch anyway.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RamGuy</div><div class="date">2016-09-24, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not going to judge until I see what this actually results in on Live. But damn, Blizzard have done a really poor job with the balancing when they need to toss around huge buffs and nerfs like this.. Didn't they say in a interview before release that they felt very confident about the classes and that they wanted to avoid doing huge changes in balancing as that often felt very bad for the players affected? Yet these numbers are one of the hugest I've seen in a &quot;hotfix&quot;, ever?<br />
<br />
They clearly messed up Demon Hunters AoE, it was rather ridiculous. But how did they manage to ignore that for the entire BETA? Players have made artifact choices based on Demon Hunters AoE and how that affects the class overall DPS. Some people are simply getting completely screwed over by such huge nerfs making a lot of artifact power going to waste. <br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that many people might have chosen to play Demon Hunter for it's &quot;bouncy&quot; playstyle. It looks to me like nerfing Throw Glaives and Fel Rush this hard will make the whole bouncy Fel Rush / Vengeful Retreat redundant as it will not be a logical part of the rotation any longer. They are really changing and messing with the whole playstyle of Havoic with these nerfs. No matter whether the changes are &quot;needed&quot; or not, that is a really bad place for players to be in and Blizzard should feel really ashamed that they had to go to these steps to begin with.<br />
<br />
They even nerf Vengeance Demon Hunter, and they are by no doubt the weakest tank in the game so players that feel like they don't enjoy the more stationary Havoc spec they are now forced into playing can't really change spec's either as Vengeance was really poor to begin with, not welcome in most RAID's and now they nerf them further into the mud.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The nerf to Shadow Priests look ugly was well. It really kills the whole risk/reward system of the spec, which is the sole point for many to play the spec to begin with...<br />
<br />
<br />
I do understand the game needs a sense of balance between classes. But man, how can you put yourself in a situation that you feel that you need to make huge changes like this completely butchering the playstyle for some classes? Blizzard have done a piss poor job when they feel the need for huge changes like this. Wow.</div></div><hr />

It can perform very nicely, it's not that bad per se, it's just the worst tank to play by a mile and a half, it's boring and not really engaging. I'll take back my Guard, Chi Explosion, Dyzzing Haze and Shuffle when they'll admit they screwed up this revamp (of course it's never going to happen, stubborn dev is stubborn).<br />
<br />
I must have some skill in picking the wrong classes, always hoping in magical and miracolous fixes. Shadow Priest, Brewmaster Monk... meh.<br />
It's really becoming annoying, especially in a alt-unfriendly expansion like Legion.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I feel like BrM is a half-finished spec. Everything about it plays like it wants to be a self-healing class, and yet it has virtually NO self-healing. Orbs drop insanely infrequently, and without healing, Stagger and Purify end up being terribly inefficient mechanics, especially since Purify now has diminishing returns. I can sit on a mob nearly all day on my Paladin, but BrM does not have anywhere near the mitigation and self-sustain that many other tank classes have. I keep playing it and thinking &quot;Is this really it? Is this what it was supposed to be?&quot;. If I have a healer on me, I'm great. I'm basically providing them with a healing boost! But solo, BrM just feels like trash.</div></div><hr />

I read posts like this, and I get why WoW will never be balanced. <br />
<br />
One one hand, you have to practically be a math major to play your class - see above. It's a game. I don't want to have to calculate anything to play a game. I get that there are min/maxers who drive down 5 decimal points into everything, but that's not fun to most people. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, you mention fun. If they made specs for fun, ie. payoffs for the player, the entire raiding community would fall to the floor in tears of rage because it's &quot;Dumbing down the game!&quot; <br />
<br />
How do you design to that? They've tried the middle road approach, and a little of each...and everyone complained. <br />
<br />
Wow will never be balanced. <br />
<br />
Me, i think they should just say &quot;fuck balance&quot; and go for whatever they want. Demon hunters are OP? They're supposed to be, deal with it. But add things to other classes to make up for not being top DPS - everything now is based off the DPS meter, unless you're healing, and that's just dumb. Start designing true support classes and talents so players will still be needed, regardless if they're top on DPS meters. <br />
<br />
Eh, fuck it. Everyone will complain about that, too. <br />
<br />
That's why WoW will never be balanced - there are too many camps with too many agendas and while the average WoW player doesn't know what they want, they complain no matter what you give them, because it's tradition and habit now to complain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well fire mages are the good performers but both other specs were in pretty bad shape(especially frost). As you can see there were no buffs to fire so you needn't worry about unjustified buffs!</div></div><hr />

Monks were not untouched. They were nerfed already. Rerolling cause you're not severely OP tells me everything I need to know about you. Good luck finding your next flotm.<br />

I bet your parents are so proud of you.<br />

They actually already hit DH at the same time as monks Strike with the Fel Barrage Nerf.<br />
<br />
And this is overkill. DH is getting benched, no question. They have old Ret levels of damage ST and their AoE still loses to MM. <br />
<br />
So they sucker punched both of us, and while your recoiling they came around again and took a bat to DH's head. I would watch out, at this rate it's going to come around for your FoF.</div></div><hr />

Fuck Blizzard, bunch of mouthbreathing idiots with literally zero clue on their own game.<br />
Fuck WoW, Legion was a fucking asian quest-fest, dungeons were nothing but trash-smashing, and then bosses who fell over due to an almost complete lack of mechanics.<br />
Raid looked good design-wise, but no set-items, bosses wheren't exciting at all, no, now I understand why som many long lasting Blizzard employees quit...<br />
I wouldn't want to spoil my name and reputation on something as shit as this, because that is what Legion is: Complete and utter shit, maintained bye people who'd do better in the special olympics.<br />

Glad Destiny just got an expansion, maybe I'll go back to that.<br />

LOL. &quot;Reputation&quot;. Thanks mate I really needed the laugh today. :).

<br />
I'm sure they took raid balance into consideration. Locks were very crappy in most aspects. Hell I stopped playing mine altogether although I did hear good things about Destro. Vengeance nerfs Pvewise are because they were just mastery stacking and becoming way too strong in comparison to most tanks.</div></div><hr />

The DH hit when WW was hit was a slap on the wrist that did nothing. DH was still top by far. And yes I already know they'll be hitting us again, least played class so least played by devs. The devs play mages and hunters so everyone knows if you want to be top you need to play what the devs play.</div></div><hr />

- Destro and Affliction buffs are not quite enough. Should've been 20% instead of 11%<br />

Then that sounds like a shitty guild to begin with. Legendaries are not needed for raiding whatsoever. Also I spent a total of 35k on upgrading an Oblit chest to 850 which included one of my own Obliterum I made. Also calling Legion contentless. Lol. More content than WoD.</div></div><hr />

Legendaries are fine. Anyone asking for them for group content are morons is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am pretty sure he is lying about that. We have 7 legendaries in a 100 man guild. So they couldn't even raid. Especially since no tank got a legendary, but 5 healers.<br />
<br />
Imho some legendaries are too strong. They should be more .. cosmetic.. outdoor-ish instead of brokenly overpowered (some of them are). For example the shaman legendaries that regenerates your health when you are underwater. That is fine, it doesn't heavily impact dps and makes you compare favourably to other shamans that much.</div></div><hr />

ok thats fine to nerf that Aoe, but THIS is the wrong way, cause all the spells are used singletarget and DH wasnt the best singletarget dps and can now be found on the bottom end</div></div><hr />
