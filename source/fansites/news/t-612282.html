As discussed last week, we’re preparing a drawing to offer 3,000 more BlizzCon 2008 tickets for sale. We’re finalizing the process now, and you’ll be able to enter the drawing beginning Wednesday morning -- in the meantime, here is an overview of how the drawing will work:<br />
<br />
To be eligible for the BlizzCon ticket drawing, you must (1) have an active Blizzard Account that was created on or before 9:00 p.m. PDT on Tuesday, August 12, 2008, when we first announced BlizzCon 2008 tickets had sold out; (2) be an adult in your country of residence; (3) have not previously purchased BlizzCon 2008 tickets; and (4) live in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Denmark, the Netherlands, or South Korea.<br />
Prior to the drawing, we will hold an opt-in period during which you can enter an eligible Blizzard Account into the drawing for a chance to purchase two BlizzCon 2008 tickets. Once the opt-in period begins, you’ll see an opt-in feature when you log in to Blizzard Account Management. The opt-in period begins on Wednesday morning and will end the evening of Sunday, August 24. As this is a random drawing, those who opt in early will not have a better chance of being selected than those who opt in later.<br />
After the opt-in period ends, we will randomly select 1,500 eligible Blizzard Accounts from the opt-in pool to receive the opportunity to purchase up to two BlizzCon 2008 tickets. If selected, you will be notified via email with further information about how to purchase the tickets.<br />
Prior to the end of the opt-in period, please ensure the contact information (both email address and phone number) associated with the Blizzard Account is accurate and up to date, so that we may contact you if you are selected. To check and update your information, log in to Blizzard Account Management (https://www.blizzard.com/login/login.xml?referer=https://www.blizzard.com/account/management/index.xml).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please note that a Blizzard Account is an account created for the Blizzard Online Store (http://www.blizzard.com/store/) -- as opposed to an account created for a Blizzard game, such as World of Warcraft. If you have any questions regarding Blizzard Accounts, please read our Blizzard Account FAQ (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=22764).<br />
<br />
We will announce when the drawing opt-in period begins on our website soon. For more information, please refer to our Blizzcon Ticket Drawing FAQ (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/25/9023727679-blizzcon-2008-ticket-drawing-faq.html)<br />

WotLK Release Date<br />
Keep in mind Mike Morhaime did say not that long ago that WotLK will be released between October to December of 2008. So perhaps you have a bit better of a range now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9023786097-when-is-wotlk-coming-out.html))<br />
<br />
WotLK Lore and Quests<br />
Some Horde beta testers have been asking about why there seems to be a lot of Alliance only quests that related significant lore regarding Northrend, for example the changes with Mograine and the Ashbringer. It's true that the Alliance are learning a bit more of the lore while in Northrend, that isn't directly available to the Horde. The Alliance has a greater view at the lore behind the Vrykul. There's also a bit more that the Alliance is exposed to simply because the King of Stormwind and Arthas are both humans, or at least... were.<br />
<br />
But then conversely back in Nagrand Horde players learned a lot more about Thrall's history, whilst the Alliance had little better to do than rescue some annoyingly dim-witted guy from a cage! Also talking in strict numbers only, the Horde have more Outlands quests and currently more quests in Northrend also. We'd like players to think about what &quot;epic&quot; quests they do have, rather than what they don't.<br />
<br />
As an aside, more lore on the Ashbringer can be found in the comic book. The comic series is meant to compliment the game: events in the comics occur in the game as well. So this includes the King returning home to Stormwind, with the throne appearing and Bolvar moving to Northrend.<br />
<br />
[...] we can move mountains when need be. Though we're starting off with floating necropoli and a magically transported city... :-)<br />
<br />
By the way, regarding Naxxramas, I just wanted to confirm that this would only be moved to Northrend and the level 60 version will not be available anymore. It's likely there won't be any achievements relating to the old Naxxramas, except there might be something related to Atiesh.

Bear Form armor compensation<br />
Bears need to be compensated for less bonus armor on leather and lack of parry and block. Period. We haven't added those talents or bonuses or whatever they are going to end up being yet because the game isn't in a state where we could say e.g. what amount of armor a L80 tank needs to handle Patchwerk. Pointing out where you think bears (or any class) fall short in mitigation (or any aspect of tanking) is helpful. This is a beta though, and there is going to be a lot of iteration until we're happy with everything. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/8537784293-feral-concerns-in-wotlk.html))<br />

Totem of Wrath Stacking<br />
Totem of Wrath is currently stacking crit and damage. Sorry but this isn't intended and will be resolved. ;-) Also, we're possibly going to look at reworking this totem somewhat. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/8202274211-flametongue-totem-vs-totem-of-wrath.html))<br />

New ranks for Demon Form abilities<br />
There won't be new ranks, the spells should scale with level indefinitely. This is a bit hard to do for spells like the Shadow Bolt, because of the way Shadow Bolt scales in the game (it isn't very linear). Note that some/most of the spells right now do not scale correctly, and some are place holder. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/9/9023697634-demon-form-ability-ranks.html))<br />

We aren't going to make a big dps pass on classes until talents have stabilized a bit and most of the bugs are knocked out. Last time we did one, DK damage was too high, but I couldn't honestly tell you if that was from a few bugs, a few OP abilities, talents stacking too well or something across the board.<br />
<br />
If we had spent a lot of effort balancing say the old Frost Rune Frost Strike, that would have been wasted effort in retrospect. It's more important for the abilities to gel first then hit the numbers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9023727470-are-dks-going-to-be-like-this-in-live.html))<br />
<br />
Black ice<br />
Black Ice affects all Frost and Shadow damage and will continue to do so. We'll change the tooltip. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9023686725-black-ice--blue-post.html))<br />
<br />
Plague Strike<br />
The Blood Plague change would be in addition the current hot removal of Plague / Scourge Strike. It did seem stange to spam Plague Strike just to keep a healer from reapplying the hot just after your hit. That is why we went with a random chance on Blood Plague -- it will probably remove a hot on its own, but if you really want to make sure, go ahead and use Plague Strike again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/8765632765-plaguescourge-strike-idea.html))<br />
<br />
Scourge Strike upgrade ?<br />
We will probably add an Unholy talent to reliably generate Death Runes. That has proven to be a pretty fun mechanic. At the moment it would probably really only benefit a DK with Bone Shield and / or Corpse Explosion.<br />
<br />
The idea of having Scourge Strike be an Obliterate upgrade has come up a few times, and it does have some benefits (especially if you do something like have Scourge Strike not remove diseases). It does turn Unholy into a rotation a little like Frost though, with the double FU ability on every other rotation.<br />
<br />
I have had trouble figuring out how Scourge Strike as BU would work. It would be nice on times when you had Death Runes, but with a normal rotation, I'm concerned you'd see something like:<br />
Icy Touch -&gt; Plague Strike -&gt; Scourge Strike -&gt; Blood Strike... er Icy Touch again?<br />
<br />
You'd have a similar problem with the proposal to have Scourge Strike renew Frost Fever. Freeing up a Frost Rune doesn't help you that much unless you want to Chains of Ice.<br />
<br />
There is also an idea to make Scourge Strike FU but apply both diseases. Then you could do Scourge Strike -&gt; Blood Strike -&gt; Blood Strike -&gt; Obliterate, at least when in melee.<br />
<br />
But... Heart Strike is pretty fun as a pure replacement for Blood Strike, so there is also a pretty decent reason to leave Scourge Strike as is. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9023784522-suggestion-upgrade-scourge-strike.html))<br />

Featured Addons – Issue 1 (By Trell (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?action=profile;u=5774))<br />
In this first issue, I’d like to talk a little bit about an awesome addon called TourGuide.<br />
<br />
With Wrath of the Lich King edging closer, I’m sure everyone is considering leveling an alt before the expansion hits.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, I’d like to introduce you to TourGuide. Tekkub (the author) has done an awesome job with this addon. Far from being just a simple leveling guide, it tells you exactly what to do, where to go, what quests to accept, what order to do them in, and much more. When teamed up with TomTom, or Cartographer Waypoints, it really comes into its own, with waypoints automatically set to guide you through the leveling process.<br />
<br />
It contains many guides, more than enough to level any race/class combination you could ever desire, and Tekkub is always adding new things to it.<br />
<br />
From Tekkub himself:<br />
TourGuide is an interactive leveling guide addon. It is designed to provide the user with a streamlined order of quest completion with smart detection. It is also designed for easy creation of &quot;guides&quot; for users with little-to-no programming knowledge.<br />
<br />
Features:<br />
•	Automatic detection of objective completion <br />
Detect quest accept, completion and turnin<br />
Detect travel (by foot, flight, boat and stone)<br />
Detection of flight point discovery<br />
Detection of Hearth point change<br />
Conditionals based on class, level and item possession (only tell the player to accept the quest if they have the item that starts the quest)<br />
•	Small “lego block” style frame shows current objective, detailed tooltips on hover<br />
•	“Use item” frame, for those annoying quests where you have to use an item on a mob before you kill it, or you have to equip something, or you have to use an item to start a quest<br />
•	Pop out frame for detailed view of quest sequence <br />
•	OptionHouse-based guide config panels<br />
•	Automatic mapping of coordinates with TomTom or Cartographer<br />
<br />

<br />
I think by december they will be little left to test, after all they don't need to implement all the raids until later, when people have leveled up. But i do agree there seems to be so much to do with so little time, they could easily keep beta testing going for a very long time, but i really want the game to come out, i dont want to be in the situation where i can't play wow due to exams again just as the game comes out.</div></div><hr />

Obviously they may well give out 3.0 (preparation patch) a good few months before 3.1 and 3.1.1 (wotlk install), and thus create an extra few months of testing and fixing time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stuff such as itemization, factions and professions (and their items) always get added in the later stages of the test. Currently, at least I think, Blizzard's 'top thing to do' on 'the list' is finish fleshing out Crystalsong Forest/Storm Peaks/Icecrown with its respective content, so the cap can be put at level 80.<br />
<br />
And really, itemization, factions and professions can already be on paper but just not yet put in the game, which has no use to be in game if the cap isn't even on 80 yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I guess the correct anser is: none.<br />
<br />
Both addons serve different purposes, questhelper is basicaly an addon that checks the quests you currently have and then points on the map where other players have completed them. This system might look efficient at first but has some flaws that TourGuide solves. <br />
<br />
There are quests that have a pre-requisite (talking to an npc, gather some object that is not a marked quest objective but is required to kill some boss, etc) an example of these quests are the bombing runs in quel'danas, if you don't read the questlog at all and just go by questhelper you are bound to go riding to the burning scar (or whatever it's name is) but you actually had to talk to an npc and use the item on the mount. Other flaw of questhelper is that it only checks what quests you have and tells you how to complete them, it doesn't tell you where are new quests to accept or what order is best to complete them.<br />
<br />
TourGuide solves these problems, it takes guides written by somebody else, most probably based on joana's or brian kopp's own guides and provides you an interactive way to complete them. It's not as dynamic as questhelper is but you can surely level faster by following tourguide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Addons have just different idea. QuestHelper is a mere information for the quests you have with basic traveling instructions. TourGuide is a full-featured guide - it guides you to the place, tells you exactly what quest to get from which person (skipping elite quests that are not soloable, skipping not worth the XP quests) or leads you to an item that starts a quest or makes you grind for some, etc, it handles quest chains between many areas, tells you which areas to go and exactly the quests for your level, makes you purchase items needed for quests when you are around some town with AH before going to the place, etc. Simply put - it is an outstanding guide, and free one</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RazM</div><div class="date">2008-08-20, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its pretty much like Joanas leveling guide but interactive. Tells you where to go, what quest to pick, where to set hs, when to hs etc.<br />
Combined with cartographer it also sets waypoints for some events.<br />
Just leveled 1-70 with it and it was really helpful addon if you are leveling your 4th or so char and cba to think about how to level up fastest, because this addon tells you the fastest way by questing.</div></div><hr />

The downside is then when these guides are not complete or written in an inefficient way. For those of us who know most of the quests and quest drops I'd say questhelper is sufficient as it just gives you reminders / arrows pointing your way when you forgot exactly where an objective is.<br />
<br />
Would be nice if questhelper got quest starters added to it as well though, and item drop quests added so you could see all the quests in the zone then pick your own route between them.<br />
<br />
I'd say if you already leveled a couple of chars to 70 then go with questhelper but if you are new or relatively new to the game tourguide is probably the better choice. Personally I will stick with questhelper for now, perhaps swapping when WOTLK comes out if questhelper hasn't been updated with the WOTLK quests.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I'd say it was the other way around, I've levelled 3 characters to 70 now, and I found TourGuide invaluable for my third character, and also for my other alts.</div></div><hr />

True, but when the guides are well made and you just want to rush your way to max level tourguide shows you exactly what to do and has the plus side of showing you quests that might be a great XP boost. For one theres an alliance quest in darkshore that requires you to go search for some animal skeletons. The first one is a PITA and may seem a waster of time since it's underwater, but after that one you get to search for more, and those are where you are going to complete the rest of your darkshore quests, adding almost half a level while grinding your regular quests.<br />
<br />
Basically<br />
TourGuide: Maximize every minute of your time and reach 70 the fastest.<br />
QuestHelper: Complete those quests you can't be arsed to search for on wowhead.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I'd actually say it the other way around, with tourguide you lose most of the lore of the game and skip the most fun part when leveling, exploration. New players should take their time playing the game and not rush through it. Questhelper helps new players in a way that it doesnt spoil nothing for them if they were going to go on wowhead and search anyway. They'll just use it when they're lost and don't have a clue how to complete it. Tourguide spoils everything for them and just makes them a mindless zombie following instructions.<br />
<br />
We had a druid on our guild that leveled his first char using a guide, he was 70 in two weeks and had done ZERO instances. He just blowed the most fun aspect of the game, finishing group content in a social envoirement, when he reached 70 we had to crash course him into playing his class and explain to him concepts like tank/healer roles and threat mechanics. He quit after his 2 month gamecard subscription expired and said the game was too boring. So yeah giving tourguide to new players isn't really a good idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, Lightheaded isn't a questing guide though. All it does is allow you to view Wowhead comments for quests within the game window, saving you an alt+tab to check for yourself.<br />
<br />
That isn't to say that it's not extremely useful; because it is. I use it too.</div></div><hr />

Totem of Wrath is currently stacking crit and damage. Sorry but this isn't intended and will be resolved. ;-) Also, we're possibly going to look at reworking this totem somewhat.<br />
<br />
Hmm, that concerns me a bit. ATM it gives 3% crit and hit rating to spells, with the generic hit and crit ratings in wrath, this could be either more specified to spells again, or all effects.<br />
<br />
Only issue, damage? I thought the glyphs were extra haste, or have I missed something about damage on ToW as well now?</div></div><hr />

Waypoints aren't used for every single quest, only for the ones with co-ordinates included. In order to achieve the waypoint functionality, you will need either Cart Waypoints (search wowace.com), or TomTom (search wowinterface.com) installed to add this feature.<br />
<br />

You will need to start in a totally fresh zone, if you aren't level 1. The guide is meant to be used from level one - so if you are picking it up say, halfway through levelling, then you'll need to start in a totally fresh zone (and even then, there may be some chain quests that you have to 'manually' tick off).<br />
<br />

<br />
188 Hours of vacation here right now, will be -40 whenever I find out the actual release date is :D<br />
<br />
I also disagree with the amount left to be tested, when you compare it to how they handled things in BC...it could be pretty polished in 3 more months. I'm a programmer myself and these little things are code fixes which is the easiest part...the long time consuming part of any game like this is the modeling, sounds, animations, mapping out and texturing the world...&quot;code&quot; and Talents/Engine stuff is the quickest part of it.</div></div><hr />

As a few people have pointed out, TG is designed to use LightHeaded as well as TomTom, I highly recommend you install both. Seems I forgot to mention LH in the description. It's also generally implied that if you get stuck and TG doesn't have a note, you should check LH/Wowhead... but I try to fill in notes as best I can as I playtest the guides.<br />
<br />
Oh, and download from WoWI, the GCode version is out of date. I need to fix my upload script there, but haven't been highly motivated to do so with Wrath and all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd actually say it the other way around, with tourguide you lose most of the lore of the game and skip the most fun part when leveling, exploration. New players should take their time playing the game and not rush through it. <br />
<br />
I firmly believe that you should not use a guide the first time you play thru new content. To live up to that, I will not be releasing my wrath guides (which I'm currently in the process of creating) until some time after Wrath goes live. Creative people will still be able to find them, I just won't be pushing out an official release the minute Wrath is in stores.<br />

Quests arent exactly hard with guide or not, ::) but with guide you can skip quests that are waste of time and do them in close to optimal order. Lot of quests involve running around so if you pick quests in right sequence you will save a lot of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, comparing TourGuide to Questhelper is like comparing an Oven to a Kettle.<br />
<br />
They are both written to do two different things. QuestHelper allows you to go and grab a shedload of quests, then do them in the fastest possible time. TourGuide tells you which quests to pick up to maximise your levelling speed.<br />
<br />
One example that springs to mind is that TourGuide may specifically tell you not to accept a quest because of the time it would take to complete it vs the experience gain makes it worthless, whereas theres a high chance you would have picked it up and continued on to complete it with just QuestHelper installed.<br />
<br />
If you were just trying to be nice, then fine, but please make sure you realise what each addon is supposed to do before you attempt to compare them :)</div></div><hr />
