Patch 6.1 - Heirloom Tab Updates<br />
The latest build has made a few changes since we last looked at the heirlooms tab (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4644-Patch-6-1-Character-Models-Class-Tuning-Hotfixes-Heirlooms-Tab-Twitter-Toggle). Existing heirlooms (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4647-January-13-Hotfixes-Garrison-Campaign-Quests-Garrison-Music-Colorblind-Options) are still added at the level 90 upgrade tier, as well as letting you keep the old copy in your bag.<br />
<br />
The heirlooms now properly scale to level 90 when upgraded, rather than level 85. The new Dread Pirate Ring (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122529-dread-pirate-ring) is now upgradable. <br />

<br />
<br />
Patch 6.1 - Character Model Updates<br />
There have been a few more character model tweaks in addition to the previously mentioned modifications (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4644-Patch-6-1-Character-Models-Class-Tuning-Hotfixes-Heirlooms-Tab-Twitter-Toggle).<br />

Flying in Draenor<br />
It's weird, I got the Garrison mission that rewards the Halaa tokens, so I went back to Outland to go buy the war Talbuk I never got. I take a taxi from the portal to Telaar, and then run to Halaa, and it wasn't until I saw someone else on a flying mount that it even hit me that I *could* fly. It was a really ... impactful, I guess, realization on how flying/not flying impacts my own personal gameplay. I guess the answer for me is not very much.<br />
<br />
I know. Blah blah blah I'm a corporate drone, etc. etc. but honestly, as a player, I didn't even consider it was something that I had available to me. I think that says... something. I'm not sure what... Maybe just that I'm not personally that attached to flying as a game mechanic? I can understand how the exact opposite could be true for others, though. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/357796-blizzard-said-to-speak-up-so-here-i-am/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15700055747?page=15#292))<br />
<br />
Twitter Communication<br />
The Real reason I hate Twitter. It causes people to use shorthand. I cannot STAND seeing people use shorthand like ppl for people, or no for know, or 2 for too/to. <br />
I think there's always a way to find room without abbreviations. The most I'll tend to do is use an ampersand (&amp;) instead of &quot;and&quot;. Things like that. But I know what you mean. It doesn't rile me up, but I have enough trouble living my own life to also try to live everyone else's for them too. <br />
<br />
The thing I don't particularly like about Twitter use is when someone tweets a whole forum post at me in 10-20 individual tweets. It's bad form for the format, and really goes against the primary benefit of the limited length format. Twitter, like any form of communication, has benefits and drawbacks. Talking on a phone cuts out the all-important body language. Talking in-person is ad hoc, and largely without the ability to put enough thought/editing into conveying an idea, and is influenced by sometimes uncontrollable physical distractions or cues. Which can also be a good thing!<br />
<br />
Twitter is quick, it's short, and it's kind of like a one-on-one conversation in a large crowd of people. It works well at getting short and quick little bits of info back and forth between people, and others can listen in or interject (or amplify it) if they want, and also be able to curate the kinds of people they want around them. It's the cocktail party of communication formats. Whereas the forums are quite like a cork board where people can type up big long letters, and post them up, people can be typing up responses to other people's posted notes while other people type theirs, and there can be these really complex and chaotic conversations going lots of different ways, but with a lot of reading and filtering you can get a good sense for a sort of temperature range of the discussion and get lots of different ideas and thoughts out of lots and lots of text. It's a really interesting format for communication, but certainly has it's benefits and drawbacks as a form of communication and interaction, like... literally everything else! ...until complete peer to peer communication nears light speed with organic computing and a &quot;human internet&quot; which is, of course, just a step away from our consciousness merging into a being of pure light anyway. Of course. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/357682-the-real-reason-i-hate-twitter/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15699675476?page=5#94))<br />

Polished Battle-Stone<br />
Polished stones don't have a specific type and i've tried them on every family and gray/whites to see if it mattered.<br />
Hey all, hang on to those stones! We were able to investigate this issue and we have a fix coming in Patch 6.1. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/357649-polished-battle-stone-broken/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15142314108?page=1#13))<br />

TM vs SS Veto<br />
Just dropping a note here for anyone that had Tarren Mill vs Southshore vetoed (unchecked) when the realms came down for maintenance this week, you may have noticed that you now only have 1 battleground deselected, because the now invisible TM vs SS battleground is still technically unchecked.<br />
<br />
It's a bug we're aware of, in the meantime you can fix this yourself by entering the following in chat:<br />

Why don't you Guys just deactivate/scale down the Ret Pala 4pc PvP Setbonus, instead of nerfing it?<br />
it was over budget for PvP. Set bonus shouldn't be worth that much DPS. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/553048715955810308))<br />
Only issue is, i don't understand why it was brought down to 4 secs. Impossible to keep up 100% now. 2% makes sense<br />
it shouldn't have 100% uptime. That's too much damage for set bonus. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/553276586904940544))<br />

Why is XP awarded by BGs so low? Agree questing/dungeons should give more XP, but no need for BGs to be THAT low.<br />

Why do you make so many snippy replies to &quot;hate&quot; messages instead of addressing real concerns?<br />
I make snippy replies because I think humor is great for defusing tension. As for addressing &quot;real&quot; concerns... (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551593415595417601))<br />
When people say &quot;address real concerns&quot; they are essentially saying, &quot;tell me the changes that are coming to address X&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551593571065675778))<br />
and my twitter is not the appropriate place to make announcements or post change logs. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551593788469047296))<br />
To discuss what we're thinking about is often confused for actual intent and just leads to confusion. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551593924863606784))<br />
So, it is more appropriate for changes to be announced, once they're made, through our normal channels for clear messaging. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/551594149569257472))<br />

Could you quickly explain how criticism/suggestions from the WoW PvP community are handled @holinka<br />
We read the feedback and weigh it against our own experience and internal data before making decisions. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/552690419192967168))<br />
But the community is not a hivemind. Many different people with a wide variety of opinions. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/552690576680710145))<br />

The fem NEs seem to have lighter hair and lipstick. I am most excited about the change to the male NE running animation. It's crazy weird right now.<br />
<br />
Don't think it's the running per se, least not after I started really looking. I think it's the cloak animation that makes it look really weird?<br />
Cause new cloak physics. I was at ~162% run speed in the mine the other day, and the cloak pretty much went straight backwards, instead of just going straight down as in the past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't say he's an idiot, though I would say he's really trying to sell not flying when there's no need. Do some want it in WoD? Sure, but I'm also sure that it'll be nice enough to get around once they fix the flight paths in 6.1. <br />
<br />
Really, I'm okay with no flying for a while...or really even if they leave it out of WoD (though it definitely would make alts of alts easier half a year or so down the road)...but yes, to say that you went to Outland, got on a taxi and ran to Halaa...well, that's just kind of ridiculous. If you want to do it, that's fine, but nobody forgets they can fly elsewhere...or at least not to the point of this calming revelation that seems to have overtaken this Blue player. It's been years and years of flight all over, and to think someone would forget they could after a few months of an expansion as a way to show it's not something needed as a whole is pretty insulting in terms of our intelligence. <br />
<br />
He even through in the &quot;Blah blah blah, I'm a corporate drone...&quot; to make it seem like we should go, &quot;Oh, then maybe he is being true in his words!&quot; No, he's not. He can say he enjoys running around over flying, or that it doesn't change his experience, but really it's just a silly post that won't change the minds of those who still want flying and in the end just makes the Blue look like a foolish player/person.</div></div><hr />

I agree. That's like saying &quot;Oh I've been in draenor for a long time and then I went back to Stormwind to do X and didn't realize I could fly!&quot; <br />

Yeah you're right, Cataclysm was worse.<br />
<br />
I'm enjoying Warlords of Draenor enough, it's not totally without merit. But it lacks substance in some areas. Levelling is too light and breezy and whilst the garrison and follower system is a nice mini-game, Blizzard want it to be the linchpin of the expansion and it's not enough.<br />
<br />
As far as flying goes, the lack of it just makes things less convenient. Being grounded doesn't add to immersion at 100 at all, it just means instead of flying in a straight line I use a FP, and then mount up and run in as straight a line as possible to reach my destination. That's not really adding anything to my experience.</div></div><hr />

moroes' lucky polish. my inventory is fine save that one item.<br />

<br />
Why?, I did the same thing. Took flightpath from the dark portal, landed in Nagrand, and was halfway to Halaa before I remembered I could fly. I also almost did the same thing when going to Pandaland to talk to Nat Pagle for the fishing quest, only the ocean reminded me I should fly.<br />
<br />
To be fair though, my main is a druid, so it is just so natural for me to be hitting cat-form and Dash as soon as I land from a FP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These days the only thing i login for is 15mins before a raid. I get no enjoyment out of spending small money on fight paths then going to make a cup of tea while the game flys me to around about where i want to go. Example highmaul raid it only gets you so close and once landed yo have to mount up try avoid the gauntlet of trash on the way its just annoying as hell.<br />
<br />
All my rare flying mounts and achievement mounts now feel useless I now have little to show for my endless grinding and skills from &quot;back in the day&quot; sure you can mount them still and walk around on a flying friggin dragon with folded wings but it looks stupid as hell.<br />
<br />
The argument i always give to the none flying liking type is &quot;would it effect you if it was back?&quot; They don't have to fly if they don't want to its a choice the people who like flying currently have no choice. To me its just rather backwards removing it once you hit cap.</div></div><hr />

I take a taxi from the portal to Telaar, and then run to Halaa, and it wasn't until I saw someone else on a flying mount that it even hit me that I *could* fly. It was a really ... impactful, I guess, realization on how flying/not flying impacts my own personal gameplay. I guess the answer for me is not very much.<br />
<br />
<br />
Likewise, I still continue to use my Korkron Juggernaut when riding around Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
I mean... it actually feels weird to fly. It's not just a greater sense of immersion, it's just more fun and social to zoom by more people on the ground and I get the sense of community more so by seeing people doing the same. Up in the sky zipping by on my Heavenly Cloud Serpent is ok but you kinda miss out.<br />
<br />
Sure, flying is ok when you have long distances. But when possible I enjoy not flying!</div></div><hr />

First of all, the love it or hate it bullshit(almost like it's political, like being a far left democrat or far right republican) is sickening and destroyed any chance of this having a serious, adult conversation in the first place. Because here is the thing. I did not buy WoD, probably won't until the exp is over(just to see the questing experience storyline and nothing else, though how much I'll care by then I have no idea), but before it was released, I thought the decision they made to remove it was stupid. Which means that I love flying. But no I don't love flying. Flying was always fucking lazy as a mechanic. It's just the swim animation in the air with a graphic. I mean how fucking long did it take for them to code that in TBC? You know what else sucks? flight paths. There more excusable for when they were created with the game, but they still suck. The reason it didn't matter then is because the game was new. Taking forever to get anywhere was not a big deal. Exploration/immersion is great the first time, but after a while, you've seen the world and just want to get wherever you're going to grind shit. However bad and stupid flying was, it helped with the pain of wow's shitty travel system. So yeah, their solution was to remove flying and do nothing else. So, in other words, revert to the 1.0 travel system. You know there was another option. That would be to actually redesign the travel system as a whole(flight paths, flying, etc.) so that it's not as painful to use, while still not completely destroying immersion like flying did. Do I know how you would do that? Nope, but there again, I'm not working for blizzard. I'm not developing the FUCKING GAME. It's their job to come with something new for the king of sub-based mmo's and show the others how it's done. Instead the designers were like &quot;it's too hard, I give up, revert to 1.0 and pretend flying never happened.&quot; I don't give a fuck about flying, I'm fine with it going, I care about the fact that it takes fucking forever to get anywhere when I just want to grind mobs for whatever and I don't care how pretty the world is once I've seen it. You fuckers understand those are separate concepts right? No of course you don't. I'll be destroyed as a member of the &quot;pro-flying&quot; crowd, because this is like a fucking football game or something, and that will be it. Like I said, don't give a fuck anymore for quite a few reasons, but that's it. So yeah, the blue poster is full of shit. Funny part is I really don't even believe him that he used the flight paths in outland. But he's happy, and so is everyone else with 10 million subs. So my final words are fuck him and fuck all of you. Good night.</div></div><hr />

I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker.

I've been making a profit off the augment focus runes since I currently don't do raid progression (hopefully will soon) but even I still think the whole rune situation is terrible. They shouldn't stack with other buffs. It's silly. Or if they are dead set on keeping them, then make them craftable. JC or something. Having a practically mandatory buff slot that is drop-only is a dumb idea, and even more dumb that it's LFR-only.

<br />
There is a game design concept called &quot;dominant strategy&quot;. It basically says if there is something that makes the game really easy and quick, it will be used to beat the game, regardless of how boring or tedious it is. When you see blues saying &quot;if X talent is too strong, it will be mandatory and we don't want mandatory talents&quot;, that's what they're trying to avoid.<br />
<br />
I liked flying, but I also like not flying. I've really loved trying to climb all the places in Nagrand and Spires.<br />
<br />
There are people who loved/hated flying, but I can't deny that flying greatly decreases immersion, and no flying increases travel hassle.<br />
<br />
I think a bigger problem is that we have nothing to do at 100. I was raiding normal before LFR came out, but no groups could seem to beat Tectus. So now I log in to all my characters to do missions and work orders, then level an alt. At this rate, I'll have as many 100s as I had 80s.</div></div><hr />

A different person sent the Moroes' Polish tweet. I can see what the first guy means though. After a daily run through my garrison, my bags now have: 4 different sorcerous elements, 2 daily cd mats, 2 daily cd books, 2 types of ore, miner's coffee, mining picks, stone, up to 6 types of herbs, seeds, primal spirits, caged animals, leather/cloth/feasts from barn, savage blood, iron horde scraps, follower upgrades, 2 types of salvage (until I open them and 2 slots turn into 8 slots of junk), and any Abrogator Stones from work orders. And god help you if you fish with large fish, small fish, fish flesh, fish eggs, fish bait for like 7 different species.<br />
<br />
Yes, I can bank all that stuff at the end of each day but it's just going to fill my bags the next day so banking feels like a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much. <br />
<br />
If you want to stay on the ground, by all means do. Sometimes I break out a ground mount in Orgrimmar just for a change of pace, or because I like the look. If I want to fly, I fly.<br />
<br />
It should be a choice, not a commandment. That is why I still hope that eventually there is flying in Draenor (though I've started to believe the devs are stalling for the last few updates where they say, &quot;We don't feel it's necessary to implement flight in Warlords of Draenor,&quot; just in time for the new expansion to hit that will, hopefully, deflect the negativity). <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed running around treasure hunting in Draenor, and rare killing. There will come a time, however, when that content is exhausted and it will be all about killing time with group finder and professions. then waiting for the next patch. That is just how WoW functions -- always has, always will.</div></div><hr />

Log in, do my garrison missions, and then swap to my hunter to do the Draenor pet tamers for charms and then the other ones hoping for the porcupette. Every day avoiding wolves and elekk running from my garrison to Ashlei. Every day having to avoid ogres just to get to Tarr the Terrible and having to run back. Every day having to avoid ravagers running from Deeproot to Cyrme (and back to Deeproot). Every day having to run from the flight path in western Frostfire to Gargra through that annoying tunnel which is easy to get turned around in if you aren't paying attention. It got old the first time. I want flying back. At this point, I quit doing the Draenor tamers. All I do now is the one garrison pet daily before moving back to Azeroth to start my pet tamers there. Yeah, good work Blizzard. You got me out of my garrison all right. Out of my garrison and back into old content. Treasures got irritating and boring quickly and aren't worth the effort outside of a few that are actually useful. Rares are often one kill only and even a good many of the ones that aren't are not worth the effort, either. The one that drops Garn maybe, but oh yay, I have to run from the alliance flight path all the way to him just to hope maybe I can join a raid to kill him and then win a BoE mount? Screw that.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand how someone can forget they can fly. I'm a jumper. I like to jump as I run and it's often the first thing I do as I start to move and repeat it a few times as I go before finally settling into a run. I also use the favorite mount button which automatically picks a ground or flying mount depending on your area. I automatically get a flyer where I can fly and a ground mount where I can't. Only time this isn't true is with something like the Headless Horseman's mount. Doesn't stop me from seeing if I can fly on it in every area. If I see I get a mount with wings or I know it flies, I hit spacebar within a few steps of moving. I have a large enough variety of mounts where I don't get only one or the other regardless of my area. I have horses, cats, raptors, talbuks, dragons, and gryphons all set to favorites. Granted, I also have 200 mounts so I guess I have enough variety to pick from.<br />
<br />
Also spending the last 7 years flying and all of a sudden I can't doesn't make me forget I can't fly. First thing I do in any area is try to fly although now with the favorite mount button, I know which mounts let me fly and which don't so I don't even try to fly with a horse or raptor. I just jump constantly as I ride along.<br />
<br />
I've seen plenty of Draenor from the ground and I'm already bored of the scenery. I got what treasures I wanted. I've stopped to watch the odd animation of mobs like hawks constantly killing frogs (mostly while I was fishing). I got the flight paths the hard way. I've been to every area. I've seen the story from both sides. I've seen the story from multiple races and classes. I've seen the story from old toons and boosted ones. I want my flying back.</div></div><hr />

Nope. The icons in the heirloom tab are not really items. Once you click them you get a copy of the item in your bags.

Wow, then I must have somehow believed a lie before it was said, because I've more than once gone back to Outland or Azeroth from spending a while in Draenor, and had to remind myself once there that I could fly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People are charging ridiculous prices in my server. Why the hell do they drop from LFR but not from normal/heroic/mythic? Makes no sense...<br />
<br />
I want some dailies too. It sucks that there's no cooking dailies and only one for fishing. Where are our rep farming dailies too? Endless farming for shards and other rep tokens is about as boring as it gets.<br />
<br />
However, it's also lame that there's no flying in WoD. Gliders and such DO NOT constitute flying. So no dailies, no Draenor flying equal sitting in dark, dreary garrison all day long.<br />

I've been playing the expansion since it came out and I'm already tired of having to avoid the same mobs every single day. Log in, do my garrison missions, and then swap to my hunter to do the Draenor pet tamers for charms and then the other ones hoping for the porcupette. Every day avoiding wolves and elekk running from my garrison to Ashlei. Every day having to avoid ogres just to get to Tarr the Terrible and having to run back. Every day having to avoid ravagers running from Deeproot to Cyrme (and back to Deeproot). Every day having to run from the flight path in western Frostfire to Gargra through that annoying tunnel which is easy to get turned around in if you aren't paying attention. It got old the first time. I want flying back. At this point, I quit doing the Draenor tamers. All I do now is the one garrison pet daily before moving back to Azeroth to start my pet tamers there. Yeah, good work Blizzard. You got me out of my garrison all right. Out of my garrison and back into old content. Treasures got irritating and boring quickly and aren't worth the effort outside of a few that are actually useful. Rares are often one kill only and even a good many of the ones that aren't are not worth the effort, either. The one that drops Garn maybe, but oh yay, I have to run from the alliance flight path all the way to him just to hope maybe I can join a raid to kill him and then win a BoE mount? Screw that.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand how someone can forget they can fly. I'm a jumper. I like to jump as I run and it's often the first thing I do as I start to move and repeat it a few times as I go before finally settling into a run. I also use the favorite mount button which automatically picks a ground or flying mount depending on your area. I automatically get a flyer where I can fly and a ground mount where I can't. Only time this isn't true is with something like the Headless Horseman's mount. Doesn't stop me from seeing if I can fly on it in every area. If I see I get a mount with wings or I know it flies, I hit spacebar within a few steps of moving. I have a large enough variety of mounts where I don't get only one or the other regardless of my area. I have horses, cats, raptors, talbuks, dragons, and gryphons all set to favorites. Granted, I also have 200 mounts so I guess I have enough variety to pick from.<br />
<br />
Also spending the last 7 years flying and all of a sudden I can't doesn't make me forget I can't fly. First thing I do in any area is try to fly although now with the favorite mount button, I know which mounts let me fly and which don't so I don't even try to fly with a horse or raptor. I just jump constantly as I ride along.<br />
<br />
I've seen plenty of Draenor from the ground and I'm already bored of the scenery. I got what treasures I wanted. I've stopped to watch the odd animation of mobs like hawks constantly killing frogs (mostly while I was fishing). I got the flight paths the hard way. I've been to every area. I've seen the story from both sides. I've seen the story from multiple races and classes. I've seen the story from old toons and boosted ones. I want my flying back.<br />
<br />
I too am spending more and more time in Pandaria and other older areas because I can fly there. I do the Pandaria Pet dailies and never bother with the Draenor ones because of mobs and the pain of getting there without flying directly to it. Anyone who says gliders and such are a substitute are downright silly.</div></div><hr />

If you want to stay on the ground, by all means do. Sometimes I break out a ground mount in Orgrimmar just for a change of pace, or because I like the look. If I want to fly, I fly.<br />
<br />
It should be a choice, not a commandment. That is why I still hope that eventually there is flying in Draenor (though I've started to believe the devs are stalling for the last few updates where they say, &quot;We don't feel it's necessary to implement flight in Warlords of Draenor,&quot; just in time for the new expansion to hit that will, hopefully, deflect the negativity). <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I've enjoyed running around treasure hunting in Draenor, and rare killing. There will come a time, however, when that content is exhausted and it will be all about killing time with group finder and professions. then waiting for the next patch. That is just how WoW functions -- always has, always will.<br />
<br />
There is a game design concept called &quot;dominant strategy&quot;. It basically says if there is something that makes the game really easy and quick, it will be used to beat the game, regardless of how boring or tedious it is. When you see blues saying &quot;if X talent is too strong, it will be mandatory and we don't want mandatory talents&quot;, that's what they're trying to avoid.</div></div><hr />

Second, anyone who says this is the worst addon (protip: it's called an expansion pack) has brain problems.<br />
<br />
How is it a bold face lie? I've been in WoD for over a month now. I barley EVER go back to the old world at this point and when i do i mount my Ground mount and after a few steps i remember &quot;oh ya i can fly here&quot; and it honestly feels kind of retarded.<br />

I can't count the times I've ported to org, or shrine or something and first thing I've done was hop on a ground mount, and I know a lot of other people who have done the same exact thing.<br />
<br />
Being bitter about not flying, I can understand. But to call bullshit on what the blue said, is pretty silly. Flying, or no flying, hasn't phased me at all. Where the fuck am I going to fly, really? Hover in my garrison?<br />
<br />
This post puzzles me. Do you people not have a mount macro that uses the FLYABLE conditional modifier? I had one back in WOTLK but even if I didn't have that on my mount button, there's no chance I would ever forget that I could fly. You'd have to be a pretty dense individual to forget.<br />

Having finished a Highmaul raid the group decided to go kill old world bosses for mounts. I landed, mounted, and happily started to run to the boss. Note I said run. It was not until I jumped off a river bank that it dawned on me, 'Oh..oh.. DUH' and took to the skies.

<br />
That makes sense. However, choice is often a decision between taking an easier route, or doing it the hard way simply for the benefit of having a choice. <br />
<br />
For instance, choosing to buy locally grown produce for a higher price than chain store produce is a choice. One is much easier -- on your wallet, especially -- than the other, though it is entirely your choice to spend the extra cash.<br />
<br />
Is resource gathering much easier for someone on a flying mount than on a ground mount? Absolutely. You cover more ground in a shorter space of time. <br />
<br />
Is it impossible to still get your materials, even if you're on a ground mount. No; it is just more difficult. <br />
<br />
Removing the choice entirely is illogical -- especially because the addition of flight only breaks a few aspects of the Warlords of Draenor expansion, and that is arguable, at best. <br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
Common Argument #1: It takes the &quot;fun&quot; out of platforming to get to rare boxes, items, etc. <br />
<br />
There is a little something to this one. I will admit, I have enjoyed trying to find my way to items by platforming my way around the terrain. At least until....<br />
<br />
Argument against it: Aviana's Feather<br />
<br />
Why this is counterintuitive to preserving current gameplay from the &quot;evils&quot; of flight: Here you have an item that allows you to bypass the platforming entirely to reach ANY item in the game (if you use it correctly). Also, it only has a 10-minute cooldown. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Common Argument #2: Flying destroys world PvP.<br />
<br />
There is some debate about flying's effect on world PvP. Some people claim that flight destroys it, while others feel it just gives players options with regards to how they engage in it. <br />
<br />
Argument against it: Thrallmar/Honor Hold<br />
<br />
Why flying doesn't kill world PvP: Thrallmar/Honor Hold are among the most hit places in the Warcraft universe. At any given time, you still see people raiding them, defending them, and yes, you still see people sitting on their flying mounts in the sky watching the carnage. World PvP is no more dead than it ever was -- it just isn't done on game mechanic terms. <br />
<br />
<br />
* * *<br />
<br />
These are the two aspects of the game that would be hit hardest by including flight -- and neither one is dependent upon it for their survival. The only thing that would change about these two examples is the inclusion of a different option. <br />
<br />
The rest of the Warlords of Draenor expansion would function exactly the same, or with little variance, with or without flying -- because the expansion was DESIGNED that way. <br />
<br />
Garrison Barn farming is more lucrative than going into the world to farm, so there would be little impact to farming if flying were added. Caging beasts will still be better done with ground mounts and a large group of 5-10, for leather or fur. Upgrading your mine and herb garden will still net tremendous gains, combined with light farming in the world. The player will also still spend most of their game time in their garrisons, anyway -- queuing missions, gathering materials, defending from invasions, etc. <br />
<br />
In short, I cannot see how flying would be detrimental to the current expansion as it exists right now. The only thing it would allow for is ease of travel. There are already items in the game that let you bypass ground mechanics, PvP situations, and just about every other design choice implemented in the game.<br />
<br />
At this point, omitting flight just seems like more of an excuse than a logical design choice. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tl;dr version: There isn't much evidence to support flight being detrimental to the current expansion. It just lengthens the amount of time spent traveling. <br />
<br />
Also, if the devs wanted to preserve certain story content, they could just implement no fly zones. That would be far more preferable than removing flight entirely.</div></div><hr />

Don't treat the Feather like it makes everything easier-- in many ways it makes getting some of the treasures harder than it should be (the Spires of Arak tightrope treasures in particular are not helped by this)<br />
<br />
Heck, on one of the ropes you're better served by hiring a Rogue with Shadowstep and a Swapblaster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're definitely right about Spires of Arak. The tree covering, itself, makes the platforming nigh irritating. My main is a rogue, so I definitely have used my repertoire to get these treasures (though not that much easier than other classes). <br />
<br />
At the same time, the tree covering would also make it difficult to land in the right place with a flying mount for some treasures, as well. It is pretty dense and low to the ground. <br />
<br />
Still, we're talking a handful of treasures out of the hundreds throughout Draenor. Most of the treasures are in elevated places that require some platforming -- unless you have the feather that bypasses terrain climbing. <br />
<br />
When I look at it objectively, it just seems like the only real difference between flying via mount, and flying via feather, is a matter of a few minutes (i.e. artificially prolonging a task). You are still bypassing the normal ground mechanics, just a little more slowly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I love his condescending, &quot;blah blah blah I'm a corporate drone.&quot;<br />

These people really shouldn't be in contact with the public. If I say something even slightly as snide as that over the phone at my job I get a 10 minute meeting because the batshit customer sends in an email making up an exaggerated situation with both of my supervisors. He's entitled to have his little arrogant opinions and be a prick all he wants, but for him and all the others to be allowed to do it on a regular basis is pretty bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway.<br />
<br />
You're not missing much. The fact that I couldn't enjoy flying except for Aviana's feather which is absolutely amazing when I'm not restricted to the ground, and the fact that I won't be able to access the tier that has actual effort put into it without raiding flex or Mythic for the better sets just makes it completely unappealing to me. I had to quit for school anyway but at this rate I just don't care anymore. Maybe if they go back to &quot;casual-mode&quot; of tier set models not being separated to their 100 different difficulties, flying being in the game, and not everything from professions to garrisons and garrison achievements or invasions being a mindless grind I might come back.<br />
<br />
I'm glad some of you enjoy spending 120 hours a week devoting your lives to World of Warcraft and like feeling like you put a tremendous amount of effort(time) into obtaining something but that isn't my idea of fun.<br />

The no of expletives i would use for that gentleman, would get me banned on any forum. Suffice to say, he is just toeing his employer's bottom line and relating 'fake ancedotes'. The lack of flying just exposes the weakness of this xpac, which is the garrisons and the lack of outdoor content. I have no reason to even be in my garrison anymore. I have maxed out my buildings, got a ton of resources, got the craftables i needed, leveled 3 to 100 and explored all the nooks and crannies and done the stupid treasure bit. Archaeology is dead to me and that's that. <br />
<br />
Flying i am assuming is done for, at this point in the game. They are not going to bring it back, to expose their wafer thin content and their efforts at forcing more time expenditure in the game.</div></div><hr />

Instead of BC2.0 this expansion is turning into WotLK-lite. It feels like Coliseum update all over again, where everything went to shit while they worked on the final raid. Why didn't they just have the world bosses in Ashran if they want to bring back world-pvp so badly?<br />
<br />
Regardless, I don't how much more of these Twitter-tier blue posts I can take.<br />
<br />
As for the usual pro-flier complaints, invest in Garrison Inn and/or Workshop like you were told. You're not getting flying until Blizzard actually finishes Draenor, like they implied. If you didn't buy WoD yet because of no flying be thankful you're not actually missing anything except Legendary Questline grind.<br />
<br />
I can't think of a single instance on Draenor that would benefit from flying rather than detract from it. It's so compact and clusterfucky compared to Outlands. I'd go as far to say it feels so linear that you're obligated to use flight paths.<br />
<br />

also, bring back flying. slowing down content progression is not the same as adding adequate content. not that I was ever one to complain about a lack of content myself which makes it all the worse that I'm having to do without flying.<br />

It's weird, I got the Garrison mission that rewards the Halaa tokens, so I went back to Outland to go buy the war Talbuk I never got. I take a taxi from the portal to Telaar, and then run to Halaa, and it wasn't until I saw someone else on a flying mount that it even hit me that I *could* fly. It was a really ... impactful, I guess, realization on how flying/not flying impacts my own personal gameplay. I guess the answer for me is not very much.<br />
<br />
I know. Blah blah blah I'm a corporate drone, etc. etc. but honestly, as a player, I didn't even consider it was something that I had available to me. I think that says... something. I'm not sure what... Maybe just that I'm not personally that attached to flying as a game mechanic? I can understand how the exact opposite could be true for others, though. (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)<br />
<br />
this bunch of bullshit right here is NOT going to make people forget they can fly in pre WOD zones. If anything it will make them wish they could fly in WOD zones even more once they reach 100.<br />

What is different about the female night elves?<br />
<br />
Slight, and I do mean SLIGHT, alterations to the hair colors and it looks like the markings actually go up to the eyes now instead of stopping a fair bit away from them. I mean there are other issues like Certain armors not sitting right and looking terribly stretched on the new models. This is exacerbated by the old outdated textures on the old armors. Also there are still the issues or armors clipping terribly on the new models as well as hair clipping in a bad way as well on armors. They should take a hint from TERA and have long hairs automatically change to a short hairstyle depending on the armor worn.</div></div><hr />
