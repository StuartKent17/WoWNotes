Kotaku (http://www.kotaku.com) posted an article (https://kotaku.com/the-past-present-and-future-of-diablo-1830593195) yesterday talking about Diablo / Blizzard's mobile plans and quoted supposedly anonymous Blizzard employees mentioning the possibility of a Warcraft version of Pokemon Go. Here are some of the highlights that the article mentions. Most of these highlights are unconfirmed by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warcraft Go?<br />
<br />
Some Blizzard developers are genuinely excited to make mobile games.<br />
A lot of Blizzard developers play Pokemon Go.<br />
A natural extension of this was for the new Incubation Team to develop a Warcraft version of Pokémon Go, which is supposedly in development for smartphones now.<br />
People who have played the Warcraft mobile game say it’s also got a lot more to it than Pokémon Go, including single-player mechanics.<br />
<br />
Diablo<br />
<br />
Diablo III had a second expansion that was canceled.<br />
Blizzard says cancellations show commitment to quality and that they have only released about 50% of the projects that they have worked on in the past 3 decades.<br />
Project Hades was reportedly a Diablo game in development that would be more like Dark Souls, an over the shoulder dungeon crawler that was also canceled.<br />
Project Fenris is the current incarnation of Diablo IV and the team is optimistic about it. Their art direction is to embrace the darkness.<br />
Project Fenris is still early in development and will likely not launch until 2020 or later.<br />
They still claim that there was talks to announce Diablo IV at BlizzCon, but it wasn't far enough along in time, yet one dev disputes this.<br />
Blizzard is careful to announce games before they are ready now because of what happened with Project Titan.<br />
Project Fenris is being worked on by a separate team from Diablo: Immortal known as Incubation.<br />
Diablo: Immortal exists because they heard that China really wanted a Diablo mobile game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Activision and Blizzard<br />
<br />
Blizzard employees say one of the biggest ongoing conversations this year has been cutting costs.<br />
Blizzard's response for comment was “Blizzard has been and continues to be a developer-driven company. All of the games we create represent ideas our game developers themselves are passionate about. This is as true for Diablo Immortal as it was for Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans, or Overwatch, or any game we’ve ever made. We believe that the best games to make are ones that our developers believe in.”<br />
The perception is that Activision is starting to get more and more involved with Blizzard because 2018 had been a week year for them.<br />
The meetings this year was the first time many employees heard things like cutting costs or showing growth.<br />
Activision wants to boost Blizzard's content output by adding more developers and release more games on a regular schedule.<br />
Mike Morhaime stepping down was a big blow because he was seen as the Anti-CEO and just wanted to make good games and keep employees happy without worrying about profitability.<br />
<br />

Preview: Set Sail for Two New Islands<br />
Prepare to set sail for two new islands—Havenswood and Jorundall—coming to Island Expeditions in Tides of Vengeance.<br />
<br />
<br />

Havenswood<br />

<br />
Jorundall<br />
<br />
Along with two new islands to explore, we’re also adding two new events that heroes might encounter on islands across the Great Sea.<br />
<br />
Azerite Ruptures – Upon encountering an Azerite Rupture, you deploy a device to collect it, which will summon waves of Azerite-themed enemies several times before drawing out a rare or rare elite enemy. As these are Azerite-themed creatures, they’re a bit more lucrative than the usual island natives. You’ll also need to be ready to face more than just the creatures summoned by the device—each time this is activated, a map-wide announcement is made alerting the enemy team of the location.<br />
<br />
Azerite Extractors – Once you’ve discovered an Azerite Extractor location, you can deploy an extractor which will grant your team Azerite over time. However, this extractor can be overtaken easily by the enemy team; it also draws the attention of nearby NPCs. Once an extractor is deployed by a faction, all players will learn about the extractor's location immediately, so watch out for unexpected guests!<br />
<br />
Island Gameplay Evolution<br />
Since the launch of Battle for Azeroth, we’ve continued to iterate on Island Expeditions. In Tides of Vengeance, we’ve tried to shake things up with the addition of Azerite Ruptures and Extractors, add a bit more variety to what you can expect on any given island. You may encounter one of these in place of an invasion, and even invasions will have more variety—for example, you may face Southsea Pirates and Earth Elementals on an upcoming island visit.<br />
<br />
We’ve also worked to cluster NPC enemies that inhabit the islands closer together, giving you a bit more space between points of interest (map space permitting), so spawns should feel a bit more organic to the island you’re on.<br />
<br />
With these changes, we’re looking to increase replayability and create more unique encounters each time you return. This doesn’t mean you won’t ever see an Azerite Invasion again, but it should no longer be something you encounter every Island Expedition. Perhaps you’ll run into an island that spawns so many giants it becomes a giant-killing-fest. . . .<br />
<br />
About Island Expeditions<br />
If you’ve never taken part in an Island Expedition, there’s no better time to sail into the action.<br />
<br />
Why We Fight: Azerite is seeping up from the wound that Sargeras’ blade dealt to Azeroth, and an incredible new resource is waiting to be claimed by the Horde, the Alliance, and anyone else seeking power. When you set out on an Island Expedition, you’ll compete for this resource to empower your Heart of Azeroth and to aid your faction in the race to control as much of the world’s Azerite as possible.<br />
<br />
Your Mission: You’ll queue for Normal, Heroic, Mythic, or PvP difficulties either alone or with a group by using an Expedition table in Zuldazar Harbor (Horde) or Boralus Harbor (Alliance). Island Expeditions are three-player encounters, and while you can play as any mix of roles, you’ll want to make sure you’re coordinating with the rest of your group to overcome the opposing faction and acquire 6,000 Azerite before they do.<br />
<br />
Upon landing on the Island, you’ll disembark from your ship and make your way onto land in search of as much Azerite as you can get your hands on. There are many ways to acquire it, whether it’s by killing monsters, finding treasure chests, defeating the opposing faction’s team, or mining the nodes that will appear around the island.<br />
<br />
The Landscape: There’s plenty to explore on this uncharted land, and each island features lots of dynamically generated elements that provide a variety of challenges to overcome.<br />
<br />
It’s more than just the Horde and the Alliance interested in the Azerite—you’ll also confront a wide range of different enemies seeking to claim it for their own. As you explore the island, you’ll engage in smaller encounters such as a village of quilboar, water elementals guarding treasure chests full of Azerite, or rare and elite monsters. You’ll also encounter random events from time to time as you explore the island.<br />
<br />
To overcome some of these encounters, you’ll need to keep an eye out for beneficial shrines, food, or objects that can aid you. With a bit of tactics and coordination, you’re bound to find some great opportunities to add more Azerite to your count and claim victory.<br />
<br />
With extensive combinations of enemies, power-ups, spawn locations, and more, you’ll never know what you’ll come across in your next Island Expedition.<br />
<br />
Your Opponents: You won’t be alone on the island, as much as you might hope to be. There are others who want to get their hands on the Azerite, and queuing for Normal, Heroic, or Mythic difficulty will pit you against a rival team of three Horde or Alliance “Advanced NPCs.” These clever rivals will move around and take advantage of the island just like other players would, and each group of opponents has different tactical personalities, from the more aggressive to the more defensive, and will all seeking to claim 6,000 Azerite before you can and take home victory. You never know which team of opponents you’ll face, so be prepared to use all your character’s abilities to overcome them.<br />
<br />
For those who choose PvP difficulty, you’ll be pitted against players of the opposing faction to see which team will triumph.<br />
<br />
New adventures await in Tides of Vengeance which makes landfall, December 11, 2018.</div></div><hr />

Because the mobile market is the biggest market. The revenue is the same as pc and console market together. Not making games for the mobile market is nonsensical and would be a dumb move by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I know a couple of game devs, they basically don't play anything seriously because they're so burned out from MAKING games, and when they do play games the definitely don't want to play what they've spent 8+ hours working. Then they go play some other devs game and they can do nothing but find issues with it lol, being a game dev is not what people think it is growing up.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sting</div><div class="date">2018-11-22, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a likely scenario. What I personally read into this is that Blizzard might be running (RELATIVELY) low on money. The cash cow WoW has seen greener pastures, and afaik Overwatch revenue has been dropping since its launch too. Both of those brought Blizzard an insane amount of cash flow that they could spend relatively carefree. Venturing into China to farm money from mtx seems like a smart choice although obviously the western player base is shitting on DI:I.<br />
<br />
I hope we don't see a culture change inside of Blizzard because of increasing pressure from Activision, but I fear it's already too late since Morhaime is gone.</div></div><hr />

Financially Activision-Blizzard has been killing it for the past 2 years. The stock has skyrocketed. But any non-gamer CEO coming in is just going to automatically go for cost-cutting. It's an easy move to make shareholders happy. Overall, from the financials we do know that the positions of Blizz and Activision have kind of flipped over the past 5-6 years. It used to be that Blizzard was the cash cow and Activision leaned on them through some weak CoD and other weak Activision game years. But as a portion of the overall company that flipped because CoD is doing well again and Blizzard has fallen off a bit. So it might be actually time for Blizzard to be pushed financially a bit. <br />
<br />
From the outside looking in seeing quite a bit of top talent leave, Overwatch falling off, BfA falling off quickly, a cold reception for the Diablo news at Blizzcon, nothing really on SC, and stagnation in HS and HOTS, I could see where investors might be starting to become concerned. There wasn't anything at all at Blizzcon in the remasters or other news that would signal me as an investor that there is a big surge in Blizzcon #'s in the short to medium term. They might have needed at least a flash of something on the horizon at Blizzcon, like even just an image of a Diablo 4 logo, or Wow 2, or SC 3, or maybe something entirely new (the Diablo Dark Souls-ish cancelled game sounded amazing). But there was nothing at all. For all an investor could know, anything close to Diablo 4 might be 10 years away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Be prepared to the worst<br />
Pokemon Go has not had an impact on the main games. The next main game comes out in 2019. As stated by Nintendo. These new lets go games are a second &quot;main&quot; line aimed at a more casual group.<br />
<br />
This ties into a main point perfectly. Just because the core games for WoW are popular, that doesn't mean it will translate to the mobile market place. Pokemon has brand recognition as well as a game play that can translate. WoW doesn't have that gameplay and its brand recognition is as an MMO. I just don't see a mobile version having a good base to draw from.</div></div><hr />

Except not really, Sun and Moon were already in development prior to the release of pokemon go, though they released in Nov of the same year as Go's July 2016 release. Sun and Moon were well received. Since then there has not been a main line pokemon game released, and there won't be til 2019. Making a statement that &quot;go destroyed the main games&quot; is disingenuous at best seeing as there is absolutely nothing to base it on. (Let's go is just a side game, like Go! itself)</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon was the worst place to announce Diablo: Immortal, but the truth is everyone wants a Diablo mobile game. They just don't want it to replace the PC games. The way Immortal was announced made it seem like a total replacement and a new focus. To me, it's a case of 'you don't want it because you don't see anyone else wanting it'. Crowd copying social influence type bullshit. Same kinda thing that made you think Yugioh was the shit and Magic the Gathering sucks ass back in grade school.<br />
<br />
Pet battles on phones was what people had been asking for a long time. Not the hardcore raider, but the people who actually do pet battles. Everyone is gonna dogshit over the announcement cuz that's how players are, but honestly if you don't like it don't play it and just let other people enjoy it. This mobile phone game hate is nothing but a trend.<br />
<br />
Also the US is very behind on mobile gaming which doesn't help the perception. Having took a trip to China and seeing how gaming trends worked over there and how popular Warcraft would have been, I noticed more people playing phone games and Netcafes were all but dead. Trends move fast over there, and growth is explosive. I saw people playing ARPGs and MOBAs on phones everywhere and thought to myself 'why hasn't Blizzard done this yet?'.</div></div><hr />

They think that these customers can easily be transfered to the mobile market aswell. The sad truth is that they are proberly right and that many Blizzard players would proberly atleast download their games when they come out.<br />

Absolutely nothing. But it's dwindling. For some people, certain changes could be made that would bring them back into the fold. Others are done with Blizz, regardless of what they do. Others are done with mmos or pc gaming in general. Mobile gaming is an already huge and ever growing market, and they want a piece of that cake. I can't fault them for that, even if i dislike it. Not even mobile games in general, just the way they're going about it. <br />

Indeed. The times when Blizzard made games out of passion and desire. Where the focus on making money and growing bigger and bigger was not the focus. They wanted to create universes, stories and fun gameplay. They had visions they wanted to share.<br />
<br />
I have loved Blizzard all my gaming life, ever since I tried Diablo, Warcraft and Starcraft as a very young gamer.<br />

Back when game studios only hired people based on their skill and love for their games. Fast forward to now, they are replaced with diversity hires from college who are more interested in pushing their agendas and belief systems. Backed by corporate muppets that only care about the bottom line, happy that their new found staff have no actual passion for the ip's, just a passion to advance themselves.<br />

That is not what it says. It says it is being developed by a different team. <br />

Edit: actually that statement is super ambiguous. It could mean Diablo 4 is being worked on by incubation ( I doubt it) or Diablo immortal is being worked on by incubation( most likely) seeing as incubation is the mobile dev team.</div></div><hr />

What does worry me (an no the sky isn't falling I know that) is that we now have this article plus 2-3 former (high-ups) all more or less saying sorta the same thing.<br />

Look I have been a Blizzard fan for over a decade but even I have to admit to myself at least that the overall quality isn't what it used to be.<br />
On top of all this you have the whole lootbox issue that is slowly but surely being banned in more and more countries this will hurt ActiBlizz, this week a report came out that there is a massive increase of underage gambling and they are pointing the finger also at Overwatch as a cause.<br />

But other then that it will be a wait and see game and that will take between 1-3 years before we can really see if ActiBlizz is downgrading all of its PC IP's and WoW will be the 1st one to really feel that impact, unless 9.0 brings (actual) new systems (not rehashes) to the game then numbers will not recover, yes you will see an influx at launch as always but unlike before I and others that are not happy with Beta for Azeroth will wait and see instead of pre-ordering on day 1 it becomes available.<br />
<br />
TLDR I hope this is all smoke but I am worried non the less.</div></div><hr />

I really, really don't agree with this sentiment. Unless you're a gigantic company like Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft or whatever, that's really not something to be proud of. (Even then, none of them would be proud of it either.) Blizzard thinks of themselves like a Nintendo/gigantic mega-studio, which is a huge mistake, because they're really just not that big. It's kind of a shocker that an attitude like that hasn't been reigned in more than it has. <br />
<br />
They want to act like a small indie studio, while being treated like a gigantic studio, while being something in the middle. They want to have their cake and eat it too.<br />
<br />
(It also doesn't help that they've gotten, and I think undeserved, reputation of mythical quality among gamers, mainly PC gamers, similar to Valve, which has never really been the reality. Blizzard, really, has never really done much more than make mainstream friendly versions of more harder core titles, and added in some poop jokes, streamlined them, and made them more polished. They were never really worth their god-like status, IMHO, but whatever. That is what it is.)</div></div><hr />

What’s wrong with living an hour away from work? I know people who commute over two hours one way every day. And that is if there’s no traffic jams or trains are delayed. <br />

Activision Blizzard is a holding company that owns Blizzard Entertainment, Activision and Activision Blizzard studios. The list is even longer and I cba to Google. Technically you can buy Activision Blizzard if they are willing to sell. But since they had like a 7 billion dollar revenue in 2017 I’d say not many are able to buy them out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
Reading between the lines in this interview with Allen, you can tell he regrets leaving before WoW was released. He left to start a hedge fund, one can only imagine why (hint: money).<br />
<br />
In 2016, he sees that the market forecast isn't good anymore, so he returns.<br />
<br />
I mean... infer what you want, but i don't think that's good for us with the way this dude is pushing for mobile development.<br />

You also have to consider that the Legion app and Hearthstone were both mobile and quite well received by the PC fanbase.

&quot;In terms of new IP, our pipeline is in a better position than ever before in our history. we're committed to incubating new initiatives,&quot; Morhaime said, adding that the developer is looking at new platforms like mobile.&quot;<br />

Article is from 2017.<br />

<br />
Starting with Warcraft, I don't really want to see a mobile game. I can accept a Pet Battle thing, because I don't do any content with regards to that but it's a very obvious thing for potential monies. I kind of do expect a little more mobile things coming for WoW, because I felt the Legion Companion App was great because it was more convenient than logging into each of your Characters individually. Unfortunately BFA missions are complete crap and most of the time not worth bothering for such little reward.<br />
<br />
For Diablo, I think Immortal being given a global release over China was an obvious one because it wouldn't require an insane amount of additional development time for a very big potential profit increase. Hearthstone is very popular on mobile, and another Blizzard franchise there would bolster it's mobile market. From the article it sounds like it's been a long road for Diablo, with the team separating after Diablo 3 and Diablo 4 not being anywhere near ready to display after a revamp. Announcing Diablo 4 and then going through another revamp would mean a hefty delay and pressure from the outside, the same way Titan was a massive curiosity and if it doesn't go as planned it will just be giant mess.<br />
<br />
With regards to Activision and Blizzard, it's fairly obvious the Activision is wrapping around Blizzard. I wouldn't say it's just Activision, Allen Adham seems to be very much in the same direction of profit more than anything whereas Mike Morhaime was the one steadying the ship. The sources seem to imply a fear now Morhaime has gone about the direction of Blizzard overall and maybe Morhaime felt that pressure which is why he's stepping away. I think quantity over quality is becoming more apparent, especially with BFA launch having so many problems with Class and Gameplay design and the rush to release products for the money will probably be the philosophy going forward.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say the Employee's are treated badly, you can find a lot of them on Twitter and many are extremely happy with regards to working there and the Blizzard life and I would still love to work there personally (MArt Games Design a few years back, can dream ;D) but I do think there's a lot more focus on profit over it will be released when it's done in the last few months from the public PoV.</div></div><hr />

Edit: actually that statement is super ambiguous. It could mean Diablo 4 is being worked on by incubation ( I doubt it) or Diablo immortal is being worked on by incubation( most likely) seeing as incubation is the mobile dev team.<br />

It says<br />

Project Fenris is being worked on by a separate team from Diablo: Immortal known as Incubation.<br />

Umm... are you sure you want to go with the cable company as an example of good business? I mean people are cable cutting everywhere and it's not because they can't afford it. No channel selection, few good shows, and even if by some miracle you find anything good on, you spend 30 minutes watching commercials - and this is a product they dare ask money for? Cable TV is a dying business.<br />
<br />
I mean if Blizzard wants to follow cable companies example they can try, they should just realize that what makes it almost work for big cable is they have a monopoly by owning the last mile of wires. I wish blizzard good luck without the monopoly.</div></div><hr />

Lol, I feel bad about Blizzard employees, cutting costs of course would get the morale downhill in any company. <br />
The &quot;Anti CEO&quot; wanted good games and happy employees, so the CEO now wants profitability and that's it. They should take a look at Amazon and their principles, their success could taught them a thing or two.</div></div><hr />

Pokémon Go is the only mobile game I've really played (mainly since it's so easy to just put on when I go outside to run errands or do other real life stuff, can just grab stuff on the way, maybe battle a gym or a raid if I have the time) like.. ever I guess? Aside from small ones that never really lasted that long in terms of entertainment (like Magikarp Jump). Not sure how much I'd like a Warcraft-based mobile game, though. Since one of the things that fuels my interest in Pokémon Go is that I've been a huge Pokémon fan ever since I was a kid and have played all the main franchise games.. well.. a lot during my life.<br />
<br />
That being said, if it's true and especially if it's about pet battles, sure. I'll give it a go. I'm not holding my breath, though. Not too big into mobile game genre, but it could be ok, it could be bad.. we don't know yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A buyout in this case would mean Activision-Blizzard voluntarily selling off enough stock to not be a majority owner, or buying enough shares from the rest of the shareholders to have a bigger stake than ATVI. You'd need around 30% of the stock on the market to pull that off. You'd only need around 10 billion dollars to accomplish that, give or take a couple billion. <br />
<br />
IF all of the shareholders sell enough to do that - most of them are institutional investors like Vanguard these days. <br />
<br />
Doing that is called a hostile takeover, and they do happen, but you need large amounts of wealth to do it. <br />
<br />
Possible? Sure.<br />

That's because you don't understand who the players are. <br />

&quot;Activision&quot; is two entities - Activision-Blizzard, which is a corporation that exists for one thing - owning the shares of it's subsidiaries, Blizzard, Activision inc., and King, and the esports division.<br />
<br />
Activision Publishing, Inc. is a separate company, that publishes games. <br />

Last year? It basicly started with the release of Diablo III. From that point on about every decision was about how they can make the most money out of it while taking as little risk as possible.

<br />
This ties into a main point perfectly. Just because the core games for WoW are popular, that doesn't mean it will translate to the mobile market place. Pokemon has brand recognition as well as a game play that can translate. WoW doesn't have that gameplay and its brand recognition is as an MMO. I just don't see a mobile version having a good base to draw from.<br />
<br />
agree'd, pokemon as a brand let's itself perfectly for it.<br />

Popularity through controversy. Tested and tried method that'll work in some circles. <br />
<br />
Addict is a related term of fanatic.<br />
The difference between addict and fanatic is that addict is to adapt; to make suitable; to fit while fanatic is showing evidence of possession by a god or demon; frenzied, overzealous.<br />
As nouns the difference between addict and fanatic is that addict is a person who is addicted, especially to a harmful drug while fanatic is a person who is zealously enthusiastic for some cause, especially in religion.</div></div><hr />

But the article says the devs themselves are excited about this. Which honestly, only make me think that maybe Blizzard started recruiting damn casuals that do not reflect at all the Blizzard playerbase.<br />
<br />
If you actually read the article you would know that these are the senior developers responsible for creating these games in the first place.</div></div><hr />

It is Activision's fault, not blizzards 100 %, investors and shareholders ETC. If you can't understand that and just blame blizzard, re-educate your selves,<br />
<br />
If you don't understand markets, gaming, and media, ( that the chines are a major factor nowadays) then frankly sorry, you don't understand opportunity and profit in a product.<br />
<br />
That aside, is it always good to just follow money? OFC NOT.<br />
<br />
White knights and blatant haters , both of you the same scum , no less no more, same fucking stupid ignorant shitheads<br />
<br />
OFC Blizzard is in a Very Bad place Right now, and i am not happy with it , not happy with the corporate greed, But only taking a BIG SHIT on all Blizz staff , and saying they are the only ones responsible, and t baging them , ya nuts</div></div><hr />

Do you really think that this type of thing woulnd't happen to Blizzard? EVERY studio is put in this position as soon as they loose autonomy and are beholden to thier shareholders. And platform preference reflects the current staff composition at Irvine. These kids played more mobile games in their lives than you ever will. So, naturally, they gravitate closer to that platform and try to take advantage of it. <br />
Go home, old man.</div></div><hr />

Maybe Activision should really just stop making shit games themselves and stop using Blizzard as some kind of cash cow they can beat every now and then?<br />

i mean, welcome to the real world. Where ceo's in medicine are on record saying things like &quot;theres no money in a cure&quot; and &quot;the money is in palliative care&quot;. <br />

Been saying it for a while now; Warcraft's playerbase must be hitting at least 25 as an average age. The current direction of the game has been a step in the right direction but it is not dark enough to sustain future success.<br />
<br />
step in the right direction? as evidenced by subs, or more anecdotally - having a harder and harder time finding anyone ive played with for years around/online or even playing anymore. <br />
<br />
even me personally, biding my time until pantheon beta.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renuts</div><div class="date">2018-11-23, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember when Jason Schreier posted an article about Fallout 76 being a Multiplayer only &quot;Rust clone&quot; and tons of people vehemently refused to believe it.<br />
<br />
Myself and many others will be the first people to say that we don't care for Jason Schreier as a person. He really is a sorry excuse for a human being. However, he has continuously posted some really respectable articles on leaks and other insider information. The reason you are seeing this information posted on MMO-C and shared openly by so many other respectable YouTubers is because it's actually legit. People pay attention to what Jason Schreier says when he has insider information to report.<br />
<br />
It's kind of sad to read through this thread and see so many people who are just now starting to figure out the reality that Blizzard as a company now finds itself in. Those who still think of Blizzard as the company of the 90's and 2000's are in for a rude awakening. If you only believe what comes directly from Blizzard, then you are a fool.<br />
<br />
Nobody is saying that the sky is falling, or that pigs can fly. But do yourself a favor and take a moment to observe the world around you and you might be surprised at what you will find.</div></div><hr />

Talking about being disconnected with your playerbase again and only looking for profit, christ!!!<br />

What I see is just an elaborate marketing ruse to perpetuate the narrative that portraits Blizzard as an innocent virgin who has fallen prey to greedy Activision. They are blackmailing their fans trying to have them spend more money in their shitty games in order to avoid an alleged forceful takeover by Activision which, in fact, took place years ago.</div></div><hr />

The problem with that thought is it assumes all big pharma is working in unison.<br />
<br />
If one of the companies find a cure, they'll practically make all the others bankrupt, earning all the money for themselves.<br />
<br />
People had the same assumptions on electric cars. &quot;The oil companies won't let it happen&quot; was the common idea.<br />
<br />
However, electric cars are becoming widespread, obviously - since progession is driven by competition in the current system. Now oil companies are happy with it too, since the world needs more electricity, and that can easily be solved through oldschool power manufacturing - such as oil.<br />
<br />
People think they are being eco-friendly, while the only change is the shift from cars polluting the environment to more power stations polluting the environment (and battery production industry).<br />
<br />
All big pharma companies are after breakthrough solutions to cut their costs and win over their competition. If they find a cure for a condition/illness, they will trademark it for decades, rendering all the competition in that area irrelevant and bankrupt.<br />
<br />
<br />
The result, though, will be the same.<br />
<br />
They will exploit those who are in need of healthcare to the end.</div></div><hr />
