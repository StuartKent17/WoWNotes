European guild Forte disbands<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/fortelogo.jpg&lt;/img&gt; (http://www.fortegaming.com)It looks like we'll see a lot of guild disbanding before the release of Wrath of the Lich King. After Death &amp; Taxes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=7584.0) and Risen (http://www.risen-guild.com/) earlier this year, Forte (http://fortegaming.com/) is the next guild to disband (and the first european top guild to do it). We owe them a few things like the first Warglaive of Azzinoth drop (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=348.0), the Anetheron World First Kill (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=241.0), and even the first preview of Archimonde Loot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=197.0) on PTRs. <br />
<br />
A long letter was posted on their site (http://www.fortegaming.com) to explain their decision :<br />
<br />
Many of you have probably wondered where Forte has been in terms of progress in PvE after patch 2.4. Well, here is the story of Forte in short and what has happened, yeah it's over.<br />
<br />
Forte was created on the realm Daggerspine ~3 years ago and since then it has been a long journey for some and little shorter for others. The realm Daggerspine had its downside when it became mass populated and with that it brought the lag/crashes, this was during the AQ period. The choice was obvious to move to another realm and this time it was, Kazzak. Not only Forte migrated to Kazzak, the well known and very respected guild by everyone in Forte, Last Resort also joined Forte on Kazzak. On Kazzak, Forte managed to gather dedicated and good players which led Forte to a success in the Naxxramas instance with top 5 worldwide positions. The success was a fact but after sometime the bigger part of the guild left Forte to create a friend guild. With TBC at the doorstep Forte was left with only a few core players in the guild, with massive recruitment and filtering out the best players, Forte was finally back on track for TBC.<br />
<br />
In TBC Forte continued doing good but it was still a unpolished diamond but overall the results from SSC, TK and all the other dungeons was good with top3 worldwide results on bosses (Kael'thas 2nd worldwide). I think everyone in Forte remember pre-nerf Al'ar (World 2nd) and how proud all the members were, even for some it is the best kill ever with Forte. The release of Black Temple and Mount Hyjal looked really good at start for Forte but due to only 25 people being able to attune to Mount Hyjal and to be able to do Black Temple it became very hard to compete alongside with Nihilum for the first kills and it started to look bad. Forte came back in Mount Hyjal with a world first kill on the boss Anetheron. Continued into Black Temple and took fast kills and managed to pass other guilds on the way and end up as the second guild world wide to clear all the content available (Illidan World 3rd, Archimonde World 3rd) and obtain TBCs first legendary item off Illidan. It was a big success this time and there was no other Alliance guild that managed to climb as high as Forte did at the time and holding the position as number 2 in the world.<br />
<br />
For months after the great achievements Forte continued to farm the instances and gathered a total of 9 legendary warglaives from Illidan in Black Temple. The long farm did eventually draw the air out of Forte and many decided it was time to let go of World of Warcraft but with people still in the guild willing to continue strive against bigger and better achievements in the future, the motivation was still there. A choice was made to give Forte better raiding standards, it was time for another move and the destination this time was the realm Boulderfist. Together with the horde guild Last Resort from Kazzak, Forte moved to Boulderfist and left behind a very big scale of people on Kazzak, fans, friends and very succesful guilds in PvE that made Kazzak a very respected realm. Boulderfist was an empty realm but that's all there is to say about it, it lacks much of what a rich realm has that is important. Recruiting was always a problem even as the best ranked Alliance guild, 9 of 10 were not Forte material but there was no choice to make, applications was always a problem.<br />
<br />
There are many factors who did their part in the reason why Forte will now stop being a active high end raiding guild here in World of Warcraft. Recruitment, long delays between content, raid times pushed back more and more... You can't blame anyone in Forte because we as guild couldn't manage this, we tried even if it sometimes was very hard to notice. It has been painful in many ways and when 2.4 hit, much was expected of Forte and even more was expected of its members, it was number 1 or nothing. But it started at the first step in Sunwell, nothing was going anywhere near what we wanted, people being dumb, no recruits and the motivation and &quot;go&quot; spirit was just going away more and more. People have decided to quit or move on more and more and the final nail was this weekend. The power and energy in Forte came from the idea from the members to fight and compete amongst the best in PvE and now it looks like it ain't possible anymore, for many it has felt like a slowly sinking ship for sometime and now it's over. Forte did manage this kinda problem once before but it has been a rough period this time and people don't have the spirit to drag this sinking ship up again. For many its a relief, go on with lives outside the gaming world or just find another guild or game.<br />
<br />
Everyone in Forte would like to say BIG thanks for all the support from fans, guilds and friends. Good luck to all the players that were in Forte who will most likely take on different paths. And thanks all of you who made Forte and those who helped Forte to become an awesome guild for a long time. If you read more there is a long list of players who were in/helped Forte over the years.<br />
<br />
The guild Forte will be disbanded on Boulderfist but it remains on Kazzak with some old Forte people. Our movies are on Warcraftmovies.<br />

The final door in Sunwell Plateau just opened up on May 20th. We want that gear to begin circulating a bit before the next season starts. That's how every season works, we wait until a reasonable number of people are able to grab gear from the highest raid before kicking off a season.<br />
<br />
How much and when, we're not saying yet.<br />
<br />
So in other words, give raiders more time to gear themselves out with weapons superior to even S4 ones, while PVPers can't even start working on their S4 weapons.... As if the increased rating requirements aren't enough of a delay on their own. It's not like everyone will be running around with S4 weapons the same week it comes out...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Except everyone worth a damn WILL be running around with S4 weapon on the first day. The point is that hardly anyone at all has the best weapons currently in game. When that starts to become an issue they release S4 and make the S4 weapons the best (generally) PvP weapons again. It's simple.<br />
<br />
As for the Forte disband; why the hell did they move off Kazzak? That many moves for a top guild is just asking for issues. I don't understand that at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will certainly get what you deserver, but in a month or two :)<br />
<br />
And a lot more guilds will see SWP than NAxx. Naxxramas was vastly more difficult compared to Sunwell Plateau. It also required 40 people instead of 25, which is a defining factor.<br />
<br />
And I also think that SWP isn't meant for everyone, it's meant for the end-game raiders. And Blizzard want to give those people some more time. But it's not for the people who are currently attempting the first bosses of Mount Hiyal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah that's why I hit 2k in S2 while still wearing lvl 60 gear after coming back to WoW from a 5 month break. And this isn't some raider vs pvp argument, my raiding main is a T6 rogue, and Warglaives have been the best weapons in the game for almost a year, including SWP and S4 gear. I have access to raiding gear and I still think it's not right. A Warglaives rogue in arena is on a completely different lvl than his opponents. Do we really need more discrepancies with SWP gear making a difference in arenas? At 2k+ lvl there is no &quot;Skill vs Gear&quot; argument because everyone is geared the same, decked out in full S3 in every slot, so it really is about skill and class matchups. But when you start bringing in clearly superior gear into the equation, gear that's available only to a small % of the player base, then you start introducing imbalances to the system again.<br />
<br />
2050 rating requirement on weapons is enough of a barrier to ensure not too many people will be running around with them, especially given how much harder S4 will be after all the scrubs quit because of the new rating reqs on most gear. Will some people still get them unfairly through win-trading? Probably. But that's no reason for the rest of us to be put at a disadvantage once S4 finally hits. That's a separate issue that Blizzard has done a piss-poor job at addressing and don't even get me started on how retarded the personal ratings system and the ability to reset PR on demand are. My only concern is walking into arena once S4 hits and seeing a warrior with 148.7 dps 2her vs my 134dps S3 sword, rogues with 4/5 glad + 4/5 Slayer's + Warglaives, etc. The whole point of resilience on gear and arena gear being added was to move away from the pre-TBC days of raider dominance in PVP due to gear. But given enough of ilvl gap, you start seeing that dominance again, granted some classes it works for better than others. I know I had a pretty easy time with my mostly PVE geared rogue getting to 1850 for S3 swords in a couple of evenings of play, doing it in PVP gear was actually harder.</div></div><hr />

Then having PvE gear at least wouldn't be that of a big advantage as it is now as currently Kil'Jaeden weapons equal S5 Weapons with the slight difference that there probably will be no S5 pre-WotLK.<br />
An other option would be adding Kil'Jaeden-Level weapons with a higher personal requirement like 2.2k or 2.3k.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is too slow with new content. As many people said. Farming an instance for too long, making sure everyone even has full t6 offspec gear is just.. well it burns out and it demotivates. Seen it happen a billion times and its a shame to lose people (and customers for blizzard) like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
2pc T4, 4pc lvl 60 Warlord's set, Tier1 BS wpn and all S2 honor gear. Paly(or Priest)/UA Lock/Warrior setup. I had just came back to wow and hit arenas literally as soon as I hit 70. Took us about 4 weeks to do it. Mind you... S2 was way easier than S3 and UA 'locks were still viable at the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The final door in Sunwell Plateau just opened up on May 20th. We want that gear to begin circulating a bit before the next season starts. That's how every season works, we wait until a reasonable number of people are able to grab gear from the highest raid before kicking off a season.<br />
<br />
How much and when, we're not saying yet.<br />
<br />
So in other words, give raiders more time to gear themselves out with weapons superior to even S4 ones, while PVPers can't even start working on their S4 weapons.... As if the increased rating requirements aren't enough of a delay on their own. It's not like everyone will be running around with S4 weapons the same week it comes out...<br />
<br />
<br />
No as in give all the hardcore raiders a chance to enjoy there leet gear. A piece here a piece there, before they pop S4 and everyone whose saved up AP's bust out w/ SP level gear. I've heard of only 1 Apolyon Soulrender drop, and the s4 sword is very comprable. So they don't want to cause anymore &quot;leet&quot; guild QQ.</div></div><hr />

Even if I blow all my pts right off the bat the most I can get is 3 gear items, and then I'll be out of pts and it'll take weeks to save up enough for a weapon. But getting to 2050 will take weeks/months anyway, so the pt still stands... even if they released S4 right now, raiders would still have weeks/months to keep farming SWP gear until PVPers caught up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im just glad Im out of this game already. There are at least 6 months till WOTLK and it seems like very little is actually gonna be added with that expansion other than same old same old + one new class, just to make sure that 3 years of hard work into your characters is worth absolutly jack shit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2008-06-07, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah that's why I hit 2k in S2 while still wearing lvl 60 gear after coming back to WoW from a 5 month break. And this isn't some raider vs pvp argument, my raiding main is a T6 rogue, and Warglaives have been the best weapons in the game for almost a year, including SWP and S4 gear. I have access to raiding gear and I still think it's not right. A Warglaives rogue in arena is on a completely different lvl than his opponents. Do we really need more discrepancies with SWP gear making a difference in arenas? At 2k+ lvl there is no &quot;Skill vs Gear&quot; argument because everyone is geared the same, decked out in full S3 in every slot, so it really is about skill and class matchups. But when you start bringing in clearly superior gear into the equation, gear that's available only to a small % of the player base, then you start introducing imbalances to the system again.<br />
<br />
2050 rating requirement on weapons is enough of a barrier to ensure not too many people will be running around with them, especially given how much harder S4 will be after all the scrubs quit because of the new rating reqs on most gear. Will some people still get them unfairly through win-trading? Probably. But that's no reason for the rest of us to be put at a disadvantage once S4 finally hits. That's a separate issue that Blizzard has done a piss-poor job at addressing and don't even get me started on how retarded the personal ratings system and the ability to reset PR on demand are. My only concern is walking into arena once S4 hits and seeing a warrior with 148.7 dps 2her vs my 134dps S3 sword, rogues with 4/5 glad + 4/5 Slayer's + Warglaives, etc. The whole point of resilience on gear and arena gear being added was to move away from the pre-TBC days of raider dominance in PVP due to gear. But given enough of ilvl gap, you start seeing that dominance again, granted some classes it works for better than others. I know I had a pretty easy time with my mostly PVE geared rogue getting to 1850 for S3 swords in a couple of evenings of play, doing it in PVP gear was actually harder.<br />
<br />
<br />
So let me get this straight. We should believe you when you say how much gear matters because you are so skilled that for you gear didn't matter.<br />
<br />
You then complain because your S3 gear is not as good as top end raiding gear? S4 is broken because S3 weapons aren't as good as Sunwell weapons? What sort of stupid argument is that? The S4 two hander is 8 dps lower than Apolyon and has a much more desirable 3.6 speed vs Apolyon's 3.4 speed for PvP. The S4 one handed weapons are 1.5 dps lower than the twin blades. These are the equivalents. Comparing S3 gear to Sunwell gear is just stupidity.<br />
<br />
You can reach 2k rating in lvl 60 gear but the system is unbalanced because you wont be able to reach 2050 rating for S4 weapons? I'm sorry if your inability to reach 2050 rating to get S4 weapons puts you at a disadvantage but isn't that exactly the point? It is good that the scrubs quit but bad because skilled players like you can't get imba loot.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the funniest, most self contradictory post I have seen on these forums in a while.</div></div><hr />

Since apparently you can't read... my post was a reply to another post that implied PVPers complain about gear only when they're the undergeared ones. And not once did I complain about the ratings, I think they should've been in place from day1, we'd have a more balanced distribution of arena players now if it did. I just want S4 to start already so that I can actually start working on my 2050... preferably before I start seeing even more Warglaives rogues and SWP geared players at that rating lvl... that was the whole point of my post...</div></div><hr />

Since, according to your own post you have access to the PvE gear why would you ever suffer any disadvantage? Either you do have access to the raiding gear as you say in which case no disadvantage making your last post a lie, or you don't have access to the raiding gear making your previous post a lie, which is it?</div></div><hr />

Because I raid on a rogue, pvp on a warrior? Because I don't care to raid hardcore enough to be already on KJ, yet that doesn't stop me from facing ppl that do? Because there are plenty of other high rated arena players who don't PVE at all? It's lame that PVPers have to wait for anything new to work towards because of PVE progression that most of them don't even give a shit about...</div></div><hr />

You mean those guys who buy a couple of k's of gold from some shady site, then get themselves boosted? While I admit it's not true of all players who ever got current season weapons, its a BIG percentage of them. I myself am a fairly bad pvp'er, no denieing that, but frankly facing full S3 geared teams at 1500 rating (insert [lolomgl2pnub] here), is bad enough for me, I don't need to see them in S4 stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and flashnews for you , some ppl actually dont give a rats ass about pve as its fucking boring , scripted and easy<br />
flashnews to you retard <br />
speed doesnt matter , its the top dmg ... apolyon is equal or even higher with top dmg so 3.4 speed is just helpfull <br />
especially with sword specc ...warrs dont look at speed they look at max dmg , speed can be 1 sec ,it DOESNT matter as long as top dmg is high<br />
flashnews for you again, warglaives drop in bt aka equivalent of s3 but they are still stronger than s4 1h's im fine with that since they are &quot;legendary&quot; but yet they drop like all other epics<br />
so as they are better i cant see reason why s4 is so much delayed ?<br />
and yes comparing s3 to sunwell is stupidity thats why s4 should be out already <br />
its rly not fun to loose in arena just because your enemy is running with thoridal or apolyon or your enemyrogue has 4/5 s3 and 4/8 t6 <br />
dunno what was the deal with that as i havent read previous post but yet plz show me battlegroup where u get 2k rating in lvl 60 gear while u r not a rogue (as rogue u can go fucking naked )<br />
thx to you too and before u again start to speak about 2 handers speed think again..maybe u wont make yourself look like a moron who thinks that he knows everything<br />
<br />
<br />
fact is fact that s4 should be out in the same moment as last gate of sunwell was opened<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
L2P, speed matters a lot, only instant yellow dmg skills like MS and WW are normalised t 3.6 weapon speed, on the other hand, white dmg swings, slam, heroic strike are not, so slower weapon = more burst.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paying doesn't necessary means you can have everything handed in a silver plate to you. You pay to play, not to win. You win actually playing.<br />
<br />
What is next? &quot;Everyone I saw is lvl 70 with some kind of those nice purple stuff alread and I had to start at lvl 1 with those ugly gray stuff?! I pay for it and I DEMAND all that too from the start!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Remember, when you login, you're playing, not paying for stuff. I suck at RTS, but that doesn't mean that since I payed for the game, everyone should start loosing to me so I can be rank 1 too on the ladders 'cause I can't do the same thing that they can for whatever reason. That's all.<br />
<br />
When you want a Legendary like the Warglaives, you want it 'cause it means something, it's a damn gear that you'll have fun in going though the pve content, beat Illidan and get it (i'm not talking about drop rates or anyting like that). If you just want it 'cause the guy next to you have it, doesn't matter if you can or can't do the same thing, but only that you've paid the same subscription and have the right for a shortcut, then you have a problem.</div></div><hr />

dont want to step any further into this discussion..its just sad that the pve part of wow suffers a slow death.<br />
and it really hurts me when i have to see that guilds like dnt and forte who were outstanding for pve progress disband cause there is a lack of motivation<br />
<br />
blizzard finally managed to script an undefeatable boss who kills whole guilds...ppl realize thats its not worth to raid 5-6 days,4-5 hours each,cause their archieved gear cant compete outside the instance portals....and the majority gives a fuck about high end raiding anyway cause they can get almost equivalent gear with not even a 10th of the effort -.-</div></div><hr />

u dont use neither heroic nor slam in arena , reasons for that are obvious <br />
heroic jsut eats your rage for technically no bonus dmg<br />
slam is biggest fail for arena and im not even going to explain why<br />
<br />
if u think otherwise then <br />
still plz do explain how does 3.4 wpn with 607 max dmg and more pure dps deals less dmg than 3.6 wpn with 604 max dmg and less pure dps when it again comes to sword specc that will go off more while using 3.4 speed wpn (w/o counting slam and heroic as they are useless in pvp unless u have 50 ppl bashing u and u have 10 healers so u can have your 100 rage all the time, not mentioning fact that for 2/2 and 3/3 arena 35/23/3 build is the way to go not 33/28/0 as simply bloodfrenzy along with tm gives way more than imp shit and flurry , for 5/5 its either 41/20/0 or 33/28/0 but stil there u have more important things than heroic OR slam )<br />
with your &quot;wisdom&quot; it seems that we all should roll back to arcanite reaper to deal more dmg from white hits <br />
sorry but for me pve is wellfare epic <br />
there is nothing easier than fighting something that is scripted <br />
tried pve many times , ive gone far with it with few chars but its like fighting a fucking wall<br />
never found anything hard with it i was just doing it for free epics oO<br />
if u think otherwise u r prolly either one of the scrubs that got carried by better players(aka raid fillers) or u r some &quot;badass&quot; raider that thinks he is pro cause he managed to beat computer <br />
seriously ... pve is for me single player / ums in starcraft while pvp is simple fight versus something that uses brain <br />
<br />
now shoo go farm your badges (and before some retard mention honor farm for me , i dont need to im full venge +i have 75k honor so there is nothing i can use from fucking honor unlike you with your badges and your wall fighting, go cry to blizz to remove resilience instead )<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't read even the crap you post, learn text structuring, english, then we can talk.<br />
By the way, you fail, 40% from your dmg comes from white hits - swings.<br />
Slam useless in arena? Meh, you must be one of those tunnel vision warriors, gg being carried by your friends.<br />
<br />
Yes, pve is easy, thats why there have been only 10-15 guilds who killed KJ world wide and only arround a million players who reached 2k rating. Hell, Method, Nihilum, SK probably wintraded for a KJ kill.<br />
<br />
I'm sure you tried Kara, so your opinion on PVE is &quot;valid&quot;<br />
<br />
For the record, i've not played wow for 4-5 months now but while i did i've reached 2k with all sorts of weird setups, and i've raided BT.<br />

Wyrm, Forte is a guild that was on the same scale as DnT, Nihi and SK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As for S4. My assumption is that they are going to delay WotLK. Therefore if they start S4 soon it would be about an 7-8 month season instead of the usual. My other thought for the S4 delay is the arena tourney. They don't want the people in the tourney to get focused on collecting there S4 gear. <br />
<br />
Maybe expect S4 late June or Mid-July. That would give WotLK a Dec/Jan release and not make the season last longer than the past ones.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents ;D</div></div><hr />

Someone else will fill whatever gap it is they have left. I thought it was sad when my biggest, bestest guild disbanded, no-one else did.<br />
<br />
I can understand a top guild like D&amp;T or Nihilium disbanding is an notable issue, but a nearly top guild? Not particuarly important.<br />
<br />
<br />
Barcelona or Real Madrid didn't win the championsleague but i think people would be the least to say interested to hear if a club like that would cease to exist. That you don't know Forte says enough about your wow experience aswell btw. There are a handfull of guilds with noticable achievements or other stuff (Elitist Jerks for their forums) and Forte is one of those guilds.<br />

Also if you don't give a fuck about a part of the news, why do u bother commenting on it ? Not like i give a damn about the pvp news but u don't see me bothering to comment on that.</div></div><hr />

This has nothing to do with the Arena, fact is, content is coming out too slow, Blizzard is purposely not using their money on new content to generate even more money and raiding isn't appealing anymore.<br />
<br />
So KJ is dead now, what is there to do for raiders from now until Wotlk is released? Absolutely nothing. With AoC just released and Blizzard not pushing out any more content, it's just a really bad business move, it'll hurt them a lot.</div></div><hr />

Sil...apart from your other comment. This has got to be the a complete bs post.<br />
<br />
Just because I dont know who a guild is dictates my experience is wow? How full of crap is this.<br />
<br />
Can it be just maybe no one trys to sign up on some guilds fanboy list? CAn it be that people just really dont give a dam? Can it be that people are doing there own thing and by chance the guild is A. either on a EU server or be not even on there server?<br />
<br />
Hell, I for one dont gives a rats ashe about guilds thats not on my server. Hell I care even less if there on the EU servers. <br />
<br />
Btw 56(made-up) new guilds was just created today, and plently more will also be made tomorrow. Should I also care about those 2? I think not. <br />
<br />
I'll continue to pvp and pve just like I do now. Forte? Disband? Ok! Want a cookie?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, you fail to see the difference between fanboyism and competition. Some people loved to track progress of other guilds and see what they did to be further than them for example. If you don't give a fuck about competative raiding then you might not know a guild like Forte. And again, if that is the case then don't bother replying, the Admins of this site try to track every kind of news that attracts all sorts of WoW players, weither it be pvpers, pvers, fanart lovers or endgame raiding world 1st hunting guilds. I might have missaid a line but its not bullshit what i said. (guess i should have written &quot;it shows your endgame compatetive raiding scene experience&quot;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw 56(made-up) new guilds was just created today, and plently more will also be made tomorrow. Should I also care about those 2? I think not.<br />
<br />
You don't but some visitors of this site who care about this topic do. So again please save me the crap from you and all the others that respond with i don't care. Those 56 new guilds won't ever see the progress nihi/method/sk/forte/lr/dnt and others made. That's why a certain group of readers care.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll continue to pvp and pve just like I do now. Forte? Disband? Ok! Want a cookie?<br />
<br />

Nobody asked for any sympathy, they wrote their story on their own site and wow newssites posted it to inform the rest. Enjoy your &quot;PvP&quot;.</div></div><hr />

/care<br />
<br />
Who cares if they dispand or what.. Give us s4 ffs and cut the crap with guilds dispanding buh<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Am wondering, why mmo-champion brief us with the kills of guilds in Sunwell? I mean who cares? And its a serious question. Why should i care if some guild in some country downed a boss in Sunwell? Is that a new ? Does it affect wow community in any way? There soooo many servers, with soooo many players in them. Honestly post something that interest all, than puplishing a kill of a guild. Grats for them, i bet they are really cool but it doesnt really consern us!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah but none knows where they will announce the 2 weeks notice for s4/s2.. Fuckin losers, they have people waiting for such a long time...Go go dont update ur subscription.. Let them know the frustration of the world !<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AOC is for those losers who got bored of just doing dailies, and heroics, and bgs day after day, cause they never got in a Guild that does MH, SSC , TK and BT.. So to all losers out there who cant of course call urselfs endgamers, please go ahead buy AOC, and make the world of warcraft a favor and leave.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S i dont really give a fuck what u think, if u call me a noob or not.. I layed my hands on all Sx, and all the loots of MH, BT ,TK, SSC so am pretty satisfied with the game.. I guess ( UNFORTUNATELY ) we will all see u logging on to ur wow accounts when DK comes.. Ofc u wanna look 1337 dont u tards!?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Go go more retards for AOC.<br />

Its funny how you say this and yet, you troll his/her forums and place them on here. I see both sides though.<br />
<br />
However PvP gear &quot;Should not&quot; be based on PvE progession. PvE =/= PvP. In fact they dont even belong in the same sentence together. PvE is one aspect of the game, PvP is another aspect of the game. What does PvE progession have to do with PvP?<br />
<br />
Now I could understand the reason they dont want to bring S4 out yet is because the arena tourney is still going on. That's a ok excuse as it would be far for the tourney to have up to date gear while everyone esle do. So to wait into its over, Im fine with. <br />
<br />
But for a blue to post we dont want to release S4 into PvE progression is at par is pure crap. PvE has nothing to do with PvP. It you going to release the sunwell gear, might as well release the S4 gear to. <br />
<br />
As far as post goes, yes I totally agree that the topics should be about what ever they need to be about as long as its WoW releated. But making post like the one you wrote:<br />
<br />
&quot;That you don't know Forte says enough about your wow experience aswell btw. There are a handfull of guilds with noticable achievements or other stuff (Elitist Jerks for their forums) and Forte is one of those guilds.&quot;<br />
<br />
is just pure crap. Ok, they was a top guild. They disband. What do you want us to throw them a farwell party? Guilds come and go everyday. In fact If SK broke up today, yea that would go on this site and stay for about a week tops. But the world keeps on moving. Sooner or later no one is going to care because that next guild went and did a worlds first or did something amazing. <br />
<br />

Jesus, your stupidity amazes me. Did i say anywhere people should care ? No but some do care to read this. Not every newsposts needs a discussion, some things can just be read. Who said people should throw parties or whatever the fuck you are saying, its just something to read. Some care, some don't. If you don't care, read the other part of the newspost and ignore the post. If you do care, read it and post or don't post a reply. Simple as that. What im trying to say is that you should respect every people's interest, i don't go saying &quot;jesus why do you post pvp stuff, it doesnt concern me!!&quot; do i ?</div></div><hr />

I made a comment directly to you. Im telling you how your comment about knowing guilds = wow experience is full of crap. Im saying post what you want, I dont care, weather it be pvp or pve post it. I like a good laugh, I like good topics but don't post crap like this and claim to be right. My answer to this was, I dont give a crap about Forte, so what they disband. <br />
<br />
I didnt even know who Forte was. Does that make me a bad player? No. Its simply because I do not care to care for them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">F-Minus</div><div class="date">2008-06-09, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take on this whole Forte story? Well the migration probably was a problem and a guess that the leadership was running out of steam. But blaming part of the disband on the reason that there was no people to recruit is just laughable. Another wild guess would be that there is or was 100+ people who would eagerly join Forte if they would have the chance. Gearing them is the problem here, not recruiting them, so the wording should be changed, as most of the so high-ranked guilds demand gear which is available only to the other top raiders, and if they are already at the top, why change guild.<br />
<br />
I don't know I just find the elitist guilds attitude a bit crap on this issue. You have extremely good players offering you &quot;24/7&quot; availability the only thing you probably had to do is gear them a bit, but most refuse as they don't meat the minimum gear requirements, which again is laughable. The sad part on this is that you probably in reality don't even have to gear them, even if they are in spellfire or primal mooncloth as it has been proven numerous times, that you can get the job done just aswell with sub-par gear.<br />
<br />
In PvE its all about member focus and understanding of the encounter, pretty much less focus on gear as for example in PvP, piss on this post or whatever you want, I know I did pretty well in BT as a healing priest with mostly Karazhan/Tailored gear with some SSC/TK items, as you see, not really gear one would wish, but I had really no problems, well the only real problem was stamina, but with buffs and food it's doable. 2.1k healing is obviously enough 600mp/5 too, CoH build. Despite not being the best geared priest or healer (worst geared actually) in the raid, my results were always in the top 3 healing spots amongst drudis, shamans, priests, paladins. So if I can fucking do it, there is other players who can do better as me, but elitist ignorant attitudes demand T6 + gear well, there's not much players with that.... (and that was before the attunements for BT were dropped so i went through Vashj and KT numerous times with even shittier gear.)<br />
<br />
Well the news about disbands keep coming, consider recruiting people who don't meet your gear criteria sometimes, you might be surprised.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quite a lot.<br />
<br />
Because they affect each other. If we would still be on S1 and people would run around in BGs/Arenas with 100 dps BT/MH/Badge weapons what would you answer to someone asking &quot;What does PvE progession have to do with PvP?&quot;<br />
<br />
PvP and PvE progression need to be somewhat in tune of each other or it creates imbalances.<br />
<br />
<br />
And getting geared up via PvE means takes longer than via PvP means. As result PvE needs to have a bit of a headstart because PvP progression will overtake it pretty fast.</div></div><hr />

I'd just like to point out, that even if you made a new arena team at 1500 every week, loosing all 10 matches will give you around a 1400 rating. Giving you 245 points for the week.<br />
<br />
<br />
That's:<br />
6 weeks for hands,<br />
7 weeks for a chest, legs, head or shield<br />
15 weeks for a 2h weapon<br />
<br />
About 49 weeks for everything.<br />
<br />
So sure, loosing 10 games a week isn't hard, but it's going to take you a year to get everything.... And once S4 comes out the rating requirements will stop loosing teams form geting half of that gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AMEN! Stop trolling on others to try and make yourself sound superior. More than half these posts begin with some sort of insult to the person they're replying to. I mean, honestly, ragging on someone's IQ? Really?<br />
<br />
People play this game for different reasons, not everyone has or wants to commit 25 hours a week to raiding. And just because people can get decent gear from other sources doesn't belittle your accomplishments at all. If you're walking around in full Tier 6, people will notice.<br />
<br />
Last night I encountered a rogue in Ironforge with dual-warglaives on her back and a Grand Master title. People were gaping at her. That shit gets noticed!<br />
Two days ago we had a level 61 full Lawbringer pally join AV, he had just started playing again after leaving the game for a LONG time. Sure, Lawbringer is nothing by today's standards (Tier 1? HAH!), but people were impressed.<br />
<br />
In contrast, people in full gladiator gear are not spectacular, because it's all over the place. It is generally accepted (at least on my realm) that the PvP gear is inferior in PvE content. Those that use it in PvE are holding it for a stepping stone to getting something else.<br />
<br />
If you are in one of the guilds on your server who is downing the big content, people will know who you are and respect you, regardless of if they have gear as good as yours. Other people are now able to access the content that for the past year and a half has not been available to them. So what? You were there first, and they know that. Quit pouting. This game cycle will be over in another six months and then you'll have a whole new opportunity to prove just how uber you are. Stop being so selfish.<br />
<br />
And stop picking on people for not knowing who a guild is, especially a european guild, not everyone follows the WoW legacies. It's worse than jocks making fun of someone for not knowing who a particular football player is. It's pathetic.</div></div><hr />

The seasons match PvE progression.<br />
<br />
The final door in Sunwell Plateau just opened up on May 20th. We want that gear to begin circulating a bit before the next season starts. That's how every season works, we wait until a reasonable number of people are able to grab gear from the highest raid before kicking off a season.<br />
<br />
How much and when, we're not saying yet.<br />
<br />
OK...So are there any thoughts on WHEN S4 will be out given this news? I'm capped in arena points and I'm trying to figure out whether I should pick up a S2 weapon for 3,200 points and build up again....or whether S4 will be out soon enough that I should wait.</div></div><hr />
