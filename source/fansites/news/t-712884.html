<br />
The buff from 5% - 10% happened on the Tue/Wed 30th/31st March... that was exactly 4 weeks ago.. the buff from 15% to 20% will prob happen (assuming they dont change the formula) on May 25th/26th<br />
<br />
based on those numbers we will likely hit the final 30% buff on July 20th/21st.. and then... hhmmm who knows.<br />
<br />
p.s. the above is based on 4 week intervals.. if they change that which i cant imagine they would then that should be accurate..</div></div><hr />

It's been 4 weeks since the last one. The 10% buff was released on March 30th, the 5th Tuesday of March. The first one, the 5% buff, was released on March 2nd, the first Tuesday of March. Since it has been 4 weeks since the 30th, it is continuing the trend of every 4 weeks.</div></div><hr />

I know! Its like some other instance that only the top 10 guilds in the world managed to clear. What was it? Oh yeah, Sunwell! The one they said was a mistake!<br />

<br />
You're wrong. No casual will ever kill the lich king in heroic mode. YOu need to be organized and well prepared to win this fight. Many guilds are wiping at around 20% and this buff will make the difference for them, they will be able to kill the lich king with these 5% and gear increases over time. I foresee most normal top server guilds to start downing lich king 25.</div></div><hr />

The buff doesn't help you get out of fires, make you move in time, avoiding exploding ghosts, tombing other raid members etc.<br />
So it doesn't help stupid :)</div></div><hr />

The buff doesn't help you get out of fires, make you move in time, avoiding exploding ghosts, tombing other raid members etc.<br />

It's people like you that ruin this game. Why are you crying &quot;easy mode&quot;? YOU DON'T HAVE TO USE THE BUFF. It's the same as people pissing and moaning about hard modes &quot;not being hard&quot;. Quit doing them with the buffs active if you think they're &quot;too easy&quot;. They weren't designed to need the buff. Otherwise, people probably wouldn't have even killed Marrowgard Heroic yet considering it would be tuned to need a +30% health/damage/healing buff.</div></div><hr />

Well, you're wrong - and like someone else already pointed out, LK HC got a stealth buff once the top guilds started to kill ICC HCs like flies. I cant back that up with a blue post or so, since I dont really care.<br />
<br />
However, 25 ICC HC LK definitely needed the 5% buff to be killable. That would match with Blizzards plans to &quot;increase&quot; the &quot;longevity&quot; of a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True kill was the first one with the 5%. Why people keep spouting this is absolutely silly, especially when someone DOES do a 0% kill I highly doubt they'll remove the weapons they acquired from killing him to make it truly &quot;legit&quot;<br />
<br />
Asking for a 0% kill as the only way to truly down him is like putting up footnotes on every single kill in Ulduar based on what set of nerfs or buffs were currently in place and arguing which was the &quot;true&quot; form of the encounter. <br />
<br />
15% was to be expected and the slow nerf/buff aspect of ICC is a much better scenario than the whiplash of Ulduar changes or the all-or-nothing that happened in Sunwell. Plus if people think that bosses will get progressively easier with the carrot of a potential 5% buff coming &quot;soon&quot;, it entices more to keep pushing into ICC. A majority of the player base are NOT those guilds that are 11/12, so keeping ICC fresh enough for those that want to keep progressing is working damn well.</div></div><hr />

no, it wont. The first kill is the THE first kill, done by Paragon, March 26. The race for LK HC is done and over, Paragon won.<br />
<br />
Even if some random guild come and claims they killed him without the buff, it wont make much notice, and they can't even prove they killed it without the buff, no Archievement, no title, no reward, nothing nada.<br />

You sir are fucking retarded no amount of gear can compensate for the amount of total damage and health and healing 5% gave its just not in the math moron. Paragon had 277 gear at that time already maybe not FULL BiS on every raid member but the difference between then and now with full BiS isn't more than 5%. If it is soo easy why hasn't Paragon done it again with 0% as that really is the only world first left they could go for. My guess is they are and cant or wont cause it is too hard.

LK HC 0% = probably the strongest encounter blizzard ever created, still alive<br />

<br />
Remember ICC has been out for 5 months... this buff now makes 10 man basically a glorified heroic (up to certain bosses).

10 man and individual bosses maybe, as they were designed for progression to preparing for the ultimate final challenge. But the Lich King himself will not be overgeared.</div></div><hr />

No, the hardmodes are just too easy - like thousend of people already pointed out. Or do you mean TotGC/Ulduar hardmodes? Then probably yes, we overgear them... ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There's a difference, like rangerfox said.<br />
<br />
The first HCs require normal ICC 25 gear, because this is how progression works. But you wont overgear 25 HC LK, since he drops the ultimate gear offered in this xpac - and he is not defeated untill someone pulls it without the buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
0% with full BiS from 6 months of doing heroics vs 5% buff kill...these are not equal in your mind?<br />
<br />
<br />
No, because Paragon already had 277 ilvl gear on LK at this time, minus some BiS items probably. This is not equal to a 5% buff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brittany</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Heroic modes have been tuned badly all the way through Wotlk. You have three types of heroic mode. <br />
<br />
The ones that are far too easy and that a half decent competent group or a PUG with a buff will be able to get down easily.<br />
<br />
This is every heroic in ICC bar deathwhisper, putricide, lk and sindragosa.<br />
<br />
Then you have the few that are decently tuned to be pretty challenging, which is your deathwhisper, putricide, sindragosa, algalon etc.<br />
<br />
Then you have the fights like Yogg + 0, pre-nerf firefighter and Lich King which are just ridiculously hard and block anyone but the top 1-4 guilds in the world.<br />
<br />
If all heroic modes were like Putricide and Deathwhisper (which really were no more challenging than the hardest bosses in BT/MH if we're honest) then it would be ok. As it is, it's pretty bad.<br />
<br />
My guild is 11/12 heroics in ICC and we have no chance of taking down LK until we a) gear up or b) get more buffs. Thats badly tuned imo. If we can get to him (beat all other heroics) then he should be at least within our reach of beating. He's on a completely different level than anything else in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ppl are saying LK HM 0% because it is the hardest encounter in the game, and thus far undefeated. But I guess since there's mot any extra loot, its simply not a goal for the top guilds to shoot for, right? I'm not in one of those guilds, but if I were I'd want to push for 0% buff kill.<br />
<br />
Perhaps blizz should add an achieve for 0% kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Derpa derping doesn't win arguments. It just makes you sound like an idiot. l2logic.<br />
<br />
Marginally better gear won't make an overtuned encounter super easy, especially removing the 5% buff. Most of the people whining about this haven't done LK heroic and never will. I don't understand why so many people whine or try to take away significance from the hardest encounter in the game, with or without buffs. <br />
<br />
Heroic LK 25 kill with no buff will be significant. Paragon was in 25 man heroic gear going into the LK fight. If you don't have the talent, skill, and luck to down the encounter, you still won't down it, whether you're in &quot;just&quot; heroic icc gear or are showered in BiS gear from a freak bug. That's what will make the fight significant. <br />
<br />
I think it's funny that the &quot;top guilds&quot; are actually using the buff. If they're so leet and the buff is only there to enable &quot;casuals,&quot; then why are the world's finest using it? At that point, it's not just enabling casuals, now is it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yogg+0 also happened after Yogg+1, which is the hardmode required for the meta achievement.<br />
People associating Yogg+1 as the final kill and skipping Yogg+0 (cuz it wuz unpossible lolol) was silly because the actual Realm First! title came from killing Yogg+0, not Yogg+1. If there was some accolade that was meaningful, tangible, etc in game for downing the boss (or any boss) with 0%, then sure, the race would still be on. Alas there is not and likening the buff to choosing keepers is disingenuous because the buff is basically the ICC equivalent of the nerf train that happened in Ulduar with each of the bosses. Should we deny the kills of Hodir after the nerf? Should no one be credited with an XT kill because the &quot;real&quot; XT was the one with WAY more Health?<br />
<br />
Logic fail, but nice try troll. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny, when Ensidia said the exact same thing about Yogg+0 people said they are only searching excuses. ::)<br />
<br />
If Yogg+0 did nothing for you other than grant a simple achievement, then maybe sure, but that's not the case. Killing ICC with 0% offers absolutely NOTHING. Hence, if my own guild managed to squeeze out a kill in 3 months time and post it up, people would say &quot;oh gee that's nice&quot; and move on. It wouldn't make us the Number 1 Guild in the World!!!</div></div><hr />

I know my guild did not have a chance at the Lich King without the buff. Not because we were bad players but because we aren't hard core raiders and we didn't want to spend months and months in there wasting our time.

If you want to complain so much about it, just turn it off and have at it.

So if they all off the sudden they put a title for defeating Lk25hc without buff the race is still on? but if there is no achievement/title for killing him its useless?<br />
<br />
ok....<br />
<br />
People in top10 guilds doesnt care about titles/achievement/mounts, if there is a boss that hasnt been killed they wanna do it probably. Why would people go do Earth wind &amp; fire, because they wanted achievement points? No, because its a challenge, and people in hardcore guilds strive for a challenge. Killing LK25HC without buff is a challenge and its gonna matter who is the first, altough it'll probably be Paragon again :o</div></div><hr />

Right, the only reason you can't kill LK normal is because you arent &quot;hardcore&quot;? Pugs kill LK25 normal, and these supposed &quot;hardcore&quot; guilds probably play far less on average than the more casual guilds. Don't make excuses for your own inadequacies.</div></div><hr />

This is partly the reason raiding is so easy nowadays, People learn the fight in 10's and subsequently find the 25 version far easier. As a &quot;hardcore raider&quot; myself, i cannot wait to only have to run the dungeon once a week.<br />
<br />

On my server there is maybe a handful of 25 pugs that can do it, and I'm not in one, so I go with what I can. Not making excuses for my &quot;inadequacies&quot; as you say.

Maybe when they designed the hard modes... they designed it thinking you would have the buffs.</div></div><hr />

There are servers with a lot of hard core guilds, and players from those guilds do sometimes PUG hard content on their alts, or if their mains get bumped from raids, etc.<br />
<br />
I don't know if that necessarily meets the general criteria of &quot;PUG.&quot; If your &quot;PUG&quot; is bettered geared/more experienced/more talented than the average guild who has cleared the content, then it doesn't really mean much to say that you PUG'd it. At least, it doesn't mean that just any random group on any server has a chance to do it.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I've ever heard of a pug downing Rotface, much less Putricide. Pugs are pick-up groups. That would be a group you pick up out of nothing (where nothing usually means raid browser or trade channel).<br />
<br />
Your guild run, a co-op run from two high level prog guilds, or an alt run coming from the aforementioned groups would not qualify as a &quot;pug&quot; run. <br />
<br />
Could a &quot;pug&quot; run that decides to run the same content with the same 25 people every week someday theoretically down LK after working on the other 11 bosses? Yes. Would that be a &quot;pug&quot; after spending weeks raiding with the same group? No.</div></div><hr />

I cant back that up with a blue post or so, since I dont really care.<br />
<br />
However, 25 ICC HC LK definitely needed the 5% buff to be killable. That would match with Blizzards plans to &quot;increase&quot; the &quot;longevity&quot; of a raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
How am I wrong? And what in the HELL does Lich King Heroic getting a buff matter, at least in response to my post? I do remember it getting a buff though. 25 Lich King Heroic does NOT need the buff to be killable. It makes it slightly easier, sure. But I, as well as anyone that isn't an idiot, knows it is possible to defeat it without the buff. It's extremely intense and tight encounter, but you in no way need the buff. Did you even bother to think about the basis of my post? &quot;If you're going to cry about hard modes not being &quot;hard&quot;, then quit using the buff&quot;. Does that make ANY sense to you?

<br />
But people that whine about the buff are usually incapable of doing the content without it. If they weren't whining about the buff, they'd be whining that they were only just now downing Saurfang (or else saying they were downing H LK while just now downing Saurfang). <br />
<br />
It's the same people that whine about the existence of hard modes. They'll never be capable of actually doing hard mode content, but in order to sound leet, they complain that the normal mode isn't soulcrushingly hard.</div></div><hr />

I tried to be kind, but I guess retards dont deserve such treatment. So, it's not my or anyone else fault that you fail at simple reading comprehension.<br />
<br />
LK HC got a +30% HP buff, once Blizzard noticed that the other HMs are too easy. And seeing how much luck/RNG/whatever was involved in the kill with 5%, I doubt you could do it (with that gear) without the buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What version of Hyjal/BT were you in. Because the Hyjal I remember was a bunch of trash, some faceroll fights, and the legitimately difficult Archimonde. BT was what? Reliquary and a bunch of fights you rolled through while farming hearts of darkness, a speed bump while you learned the council pull, then illidan? I'd rank normal Putricide (and Sindragosa) as harder than everything except Illidan and Archimonde (and possibly RoS), let alone hard modes.</div></div><hr />

You do know that you can choose NOT to have this buff at all - if you think you are imba enough right?<br />
<br />
This buff increasing is great for those not able to complete objectives without it, but it doesnt take away anything from those that turn it off. Saying &quot;we killed the LK with no buff&quot; is still going to be a major achievement (well tbh - its a major achievement even with the buff tbh).</div></div><hr />

And like some have said, the game hasn't been won yet. We're still waiting for world first LK HM 0% buff kill.<br />

<br />
cool give me a good reason to cancel it , as far as i am concerned there is NO special reason to kill LK on 0buff, you get the same lewt and you need a screenshot that hasnt been photoshopped to prove it , yeah no tabard no mount, thats just discouraging.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, people saying world first 0% buff are ridiculous. Yogg+0 was different. You got something extra from it plus a realm first achievement... neither of which you get from doing with 0%. Will somebody eventually get it with 0%? Sure... after having their entire raid decked with Heroic LK weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes just what i said above, raiders need to step back and think of these buffs a sec and think bout what a hardmode means and why people need a &quot;buff&quot; to do one.why would you even call it a hardmode as such and what rewards would you obtain for doing said hardmodes.For those who will take this out of context i am simply saying , you should not need help to completee a hardmode, it should test your max capabilities to complete an encounter, if you need a buff for it , then there is somethign wrong with the encounter.<br />
Is this goign to be the new trend where they make encounters and people have to wait till blizz buffs your whole raid rather than actually making the encounter beatable?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
turn it off, and shut it.<br />

again i wll have no reason to turn it off, same lewt, .Even if i did down it with 0buff would i go round dal telling pple hey guyz look at this legit screenshot of me and my guildies doing it zero buff, aint it cool??.Hmm maybe i'll get a mod that attaches the screenshot link to my tells each time i speak in general or trade chat</div></div><hr />

But real &quot;hardcore&quot; raiders are after the challenge in addition to the loot. If you're not up for an additional challenge, then you're not really hardcore. If you're saying that being allowed to have a buff (that you can turn off) somehow diminishes the difficulty of an encounter, then you're just an idiot. <br />
<br />
Of course you aren't going to turn off the buff because you're a bad and need to be carried, period end. Turn off the buff or you aren't as hardcore as you're trying to say you are.<br />
<br />
Almost every Heroic encounter except LK was beaten without the buff. LK could've been beaten without the buff, but Blizzard implemented the buff for NORMAL guilds so that they could progress. Even the higher end &quot;normal&quot; guilds weren't getting most of the wing bosses down before buffs. Your personal enjoyment and challenge cannot be compromised by a buff that you can turn off. If your guild won't turn it off and you seek a greater level of challenge, maybe you should find a guild (or start one) that raids without the buff. Otherwise, and let me emphasize this with completely necessary caps: YOU ARE A CASUAL BAD THAT NEEDS TO BE CARRIED BY THE BUFF. Thanks for your qq, better luck next time.</div></div><hr />

If you're not up for an additional challenge, then you're not really hardcore. If you're saying that being allowed to have a buff (that you can turn off) somehow diminishes the difficulty of an encounter, then you're just an idiot. <br />
<br />
<br />
I didnt claim i was hardcore, see this is why you actually need to read somebodies post before replying to it.Ow and you mean the buff dsoes not make an encounter easier?? wow then i guess blizz is wasting it's time implimenting it, lets not even call it a buff, lets call it hmmmm apple pies or soemthing, coz according to you it's not a buff and does not affect the encounter in any way.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course you aren't going to turn off the buff because you're a bad and need to be carried, period end. Turn off the buff or you aren't as hardcore as you're trying to say you are.<br />
<br />
wow again with the hardcore stuff, your scaring me maybe i need to go back and adjust my glasses to see what i wrote about me being hardcore.I'm farily certain that i didnt, but hold on i'll double check.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Almost every Heroic encounter except LK was beaten without the buff. LK could've been beaten without the buff, but Blizzard implemented the buff for NORMAL guilds so that they could progress. Even the higher end &quot;normal&quot; guilds weren't getting most of the wing bosses down before buffs.<br />
Both normal and hardcore guilds were workin on these encounters gradually even before the buff came out , and as it arrived who would wan to turn it off, and for what reason?? so that all i have is a screenshot saying i did it without buff?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Your personal enjoyment and challenge cannot be compromised by a buff that you can turn off. If your guild won't turn it off and you seek a greater level of challenge, maybe you should find a guild (or start one) that raids without the buff. <br />
<br />
Maybe you will have to help me with that bro,i see no reason to down lk with zero buff if in the first place there is no extra reward.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, and let me emphasize this with completely necessary caps: YOU ARE A CASUAL BAD THAT NEEDS TO BE CARRIED BY THE BUFF. Thanks for your qq, better luck next time.<br />
<br />
hehe how you came to this conclusion amazes me.If anythign i have been arguing against the buff and now you say i need it?if i did wouldnt i have joined the mass bandwagon supporting the change? i mean go go 30% ftw amaright?</div></div><hr />

Dear Awesome,<br />
<br />
Thanks for playing for my benefit. If i give you my approval for all current and future accomplishments, will you be able to play in peace? I hope so. I love you.<br />

Be Well,</div></div><hr />

If you're not up for an additional challenge, then you're not really hardcore.<br />
<br />
By that retarded logic, the real Lich King race isnt over till the entire raid does it naked. Even then, it would be more hardcore to do it with less people, while naked. <br />
<br />
You see where I'm going with this?<br />
<br />
Nobody cares.</div></div><hr />

nothing will stop you from disabling the debuff. You can go go hardcore with 0% buff then to Lich King heroic all you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there was an achievement then people would try it (as an achievement is almost-undeniable proof of what was done). There isn't, so many won't.<br />
<br />
To the people arguing about random stuff like &quot;doing the fight naked&quot;: the philosophy applies to instance-based buffs. <br />
Kill Anub'arak on 25-man heroic wasn't the last step. Killing Anub'arak on 25-man heroic with all 50 attempts remaining was.<br />
Killing Yogg-Saron on 25-man wasn't the last step. Killing Yogg-Saron on 25-man without using any of the buffs from the 4 elders was.<br />
If there had been an achievement to prove that you Killing the Lich King on 25-man heroic without the &quot;Yell of the Extremely Stupid Faction Leader&quot; buff then that would be the last step. There isn't, so those racing for world firsts had to take &quot;Killing the Lich King on 25-man heroic&quot; as their last step.</div></div><hr />

And so far yeah, no1 would actually turn it off because people want to kill LK25hc. But once that happens I see no reason not to turn it off and see what your raid is capable of.</div></div><hr />

In fact anyone that did not kill ctun pre nerf is bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
/end sarcasm<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nobody will tun off the buff because LK was tuned with the buff in mind. Also as i said above you might as well invent your own hardmode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
up until the 15% buff we were struggling to reach putricide.... last night we got to him with 2 people sub 5k gear score.....<br />
<br />
I'm glad they are introducing something like this...<br />
<br />
for the hardcore, they dont really care, they have paid their dues and made it pretty far into the ICC heroic modes....<br />
<br />
for the casual like us, its finally getting the boost we need that we can't get from the gear we've been farming for 2-3 months....<br />
<br />
the people that are getting pissed off are the ones between the two... they missed their boat on claiming &quot;eliteness&quot; of killing LK with no buff... they are just whiny individuals who now will be claiming &quot;waa waa we could have got it with one more week of tries&quot;.... and when the 20% buff comes, they will still be wiping on it... <br />
<br />
<br />
so on behalf of all the people that this buff is aimed at we are sorry for catching up to your progress (even tho we cant) and getting all your loot (even tho we didn't) and taking away what you enjoy in the game (even tho haven't)...</div></div><hr />

<br />
but insted of a 15% buff (which will probably got o 30%), they nerfed the boss's health and damage by 30%... <br />

so its basically the same thing... only over time.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I've ever heard of a pug downing Rotface, much less Putricide. Pugs are pick-up groups. That would be a group you pick up out of nothing (where nothing usually means raid browser or trade channel).<br />
<br />
<br />
you must be on a strange server if PUGs dont down rotface<br />
<br />
every group does 6/12 on my server, most 7/12 (valthiria) without a problem, then it starts getting hard at the moment.</div></div><hr />

I dont mind the buff personally I'm busy with my new char (level 60 twink rogue got left half of bindings of thw windseeker y-day w00t) for something to pass time until cata as all gear will be replaced pritty fast methinks.</div></div><hr />

If you want a challenge, turn off the buff and turn on the hard modes. Period, end. This dungeon has been out for 4 months and it would've been nerfed to hell by now if the buff wasn't part of the dungeon.<br />
<br />
You also haven't beaten the game in two days. You can't get to level 80 in two days and can't learn all the encounters of ICC in a single lockout. No, being carried doesn't count.<br />
<br />
If you don't like WoW, stop qq'ing and go play Aion. You won't be missed.</div></div><hr />
