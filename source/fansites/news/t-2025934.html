Blizzard released a teaser for the upcoming Harbingers animated series. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Time's Running Out<br />
The Burning Legion is approaching, and the clock is ticking on several activities and rewards in World of Warcraft. If you haven’t completed these challenges or collected these items yet, there’s still time for one final rally before these opportunities vanish from the face of Azeroth!<br />
<br />
Before the Launch of Legion<br />
With the arrival of the World of Warcraft: Legion pre-expansion patch, two time-limited Feats of Strength will no longer be obtainable—Ahead of the Curve: The Black Gate (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/10044-ahead-of-the-curve-the-black-gate), which charges heroes with defeating Archimonde on Heroic difficulty or higher, and Cutting Edge: The Black Gate (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/10045-cutting-edge-the-black-gate), which challenges players to vanquish Archimonde on Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
Also with the Legion pre-expansion patch, the Brawler’s Guild will be temporarily closing down, and Warlords of Draenor Challenge Modes will end. You’ll also no longer be able to start the quest line for your Legendary ring—and if you aren’t already on Chapter II (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/9641-chapter-ii-guldan-strikes-back) or later, the quest will be removed from your quest log.<br />
<br />
When Legion Arrives<br />
When World of Warcraft: Legion goes live on August 30, the Legendary ring will become completely unavailable, any quest from the quest line will be removed from your quest log, and Crystallized Fel will no longer be obtainable.<br />
<br />
As of the launch of the expansion, the Grove Warden (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/189999-grove-warden) moose mount will no longer be obtainable. However, players who have received their Remnant of Chaos (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133762-remnant-of-chaos) by participating in a victory over Archimonde in the Hellfire Citadel on Heroic or Mythic difficulty but haven’t yet taken the Remnant to Moonglade will still be able to do so after the Legion launch.<br />
<br />
On August 30, the Ironhoof Destroyer (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/171621-ironhoof-destroyer) and Felsteel Annihilator (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/182912-felsteel-annihilator) mounts from Mythic Blackhand and Mythic Archimonde will no longer be guaranteed rewards—they will become rare drops instead.<br />
<br />
Finally, Warlords of Draenor Mythic dungeon bosses currently have a chance to drop Heirloom trinkets that scale with you to level 110. These will no longer drop after the expansion launches on August 30:<br />
<br />
<br />
Judgment of the Naaru (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133585-judgment-of-the-naaru)<br />
Orb of Voidsight (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133596-orb-of-voidsight)<br />
Infallible Tracking Charm (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133597-infallible-tracking-charm)<br />
Purified Shard of the Third Moon (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133598-purified-shard-of-the-third-moon)<br />
Gronntooth War Horn (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133595-gronntooth-war-horn)<br />
<br />
<br />
If you haven’t yet accomplished all you’ve set out to do in Warlords of Draenor, now is the time to strike!</div></div><hr />

It's probably on the 19th due to that being the announced end of the current pvp season.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never heard that rumor, but this is most likely just a heavy legion attack, which almost caused it to plummet. Legion Dalaran is, afterall, damaged.<br />

Feels like you are being told a story rather than actually watching it happen which I like, like you are just conjuring it in your mind as someone tells you what happened...it's really good :D<br />

Same here. I really wish that Blizzard would increase the drop rate like they did for the SoO heirlooms before they were finally removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, what typically happens is - it will drop one for your spec first usually, then the next boss that drops it for you in particular, it will just RNG the other 4. So I've ALWAYS healed Mythic Dungeons (And btw, they were decently hard with iLvl 665-670 even), and now with the upgrades, and everyone having 700+++++ those things are dropping all the time for people. I think I had to run 2-3 weeks to get all 5, and again I kept healing spec for all of those drops so.. But yeah as long as people run then this week forward, it's almost guaranteed you'll have then before Legion (LEG) drops.</div></div><hr />

It's not sadly. The droprate was bugged during the first weeks after the patch hit live, got hotfixed.. so the droprate is about the same as the loom weapons from Garrosh in MoP. Started farming them a few weeks after the patch, so sadly after the hotfix.. and there's still 2 or 3 I'm missing.</div></div><hr />

You can get all 5 of them on one character. The first one you get is always based on what your class/spec is at the time, and then you'll get the rest in a random order.</div></div><hr />

2 tanking heirlooms? Btw all 5 can drop with the same char. The first one is related to your spec, the rest are random</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I admit that I agree with Blizzard removing the questline in general (Kind of makes the legendaries a bit more special, or at the very least exclusive) I feel that they should add some way to revisit the lore, or even to run through the quests without the rewards/grinding, that way people can get the lore (and a fair bit of WoD lore was tied into the Legendary quest) while still maintaining the exclusivity of the items.</div></div><hr />

Correcto JesterBro, no duplicates, it drops the first for the spec you are running/selected, then it just gives you the other 4, no duplicates sir.<br />

I doubt spending 20,000gold and getting carried like 99% of everyone who has it.. is honestly even remotely hard though Aliok. I mean, don't get me wrong, taking it out of the game.. it's almost like Garrosh in MoP with that wolf right? I mean, I guess if blizzard wasn't already taking stuff out of the game since Classic, I'd just see the issue plain as day, but when they've been doing this for so long, I guess I just don't see it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has to do with the lore/game side itself. Why have a piece of something still in the game for only a select few. If you're a raider, you had that puppy maxed out months and months ago - if you're a filthy casual like me, you probably JUST got 795 from heroic arch kills/valor - I hear you on the completionist stuff though, but at least you HAVE the legendary, that's all that matters IMO. You can still kill normal arch, get TONS of valor before the xpac, I mean we are talking each week for the next two months! You have 8 weeks with 8 X normal+ arch kills, + around 3 a week you could farm with valor per week to = at least 30-35 (and that's easily maxing out a ring), from right now until the xpac drops.</div></div><hr />

Aaaaand there it is. I was wondering when Blizzard was going to get their Last Laugh (http://www.wowdb.com/items/40402-last-laugh) in - because screw people wanting content in the game, not outside of it.<br />

This was announced WITH the mount. They said the grove warden would be only available until Legion launched.</div></div><hr />

WoW will not be going free to play ANYTIME in the next 5 years. The only reason a game goes free to play from paid is: The game has tanked and is no longer visible, you make more money off pay to WIN model.. and or: You want a toxic community driving your paid subscribers into the ABYSS.<br />
<br />
Pay to win/free to play communities are some of the worst parts of the entire internet.<br />
<br />
EVE has like 500,000 subs.. STILL charges it's monthly fee.. why would Blizzard make a game free to play when it's still making hand of fist money on it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The obvious reason that comes to mind is so they can create similar heirloom trinkets in legion to incentivize running *current* content. Otherwise you would require people to go back to old content and mindlessly farm it in the hopes of getting a trinket for alts and whatnot. Pointless. Old gear for transmog is one thing but heirlooms confer real bonuses to characters. Trapping them in old content makes no sense.</div></div><hr />

I mean personally removing the heirlooms is something to get people pumped from 100-110, added help/pre-patch fun/testing.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying some games can't stay tight nit with F2P, but typically, it destroys MMO's.. and I mean going from Sub to F2P literally makes people LEAVE the game they've loved since they started. I sure as hell hope Blizz doesn't make the game f2p, ever imo..</div></div><hr />

Why have a piece of something still in the game for only a select few. If you're a raider, you had that puppy maxed out months and months ago - if you're a filthy casual like me, you probably JUST got 795 from heroic arch kills/valor - I hear you on the completionist stuff though, but at least you HAVE the legendary, that's all that matters IMO. You can still kill normal arch, get TONS of valor before the xpac, I mean we are talking each week for the next two months! You have 8 weeks with 8 X normal+ arch kills, + around 3 a week you could farm with valor per week to = at least 30-35 (and that's easily maxing out a ring), from right now until the xpac drops.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't raid even normal as I don't have a guild and you need to get it with a guild as people won't take anyone without the achievement and like 730ilvl.<br />
Yes, I know gear doesn't matter if you don't raid heroic or mythic, but I want it anyway :P<br />
I still need 33 ilvl, so 11 upgrades in 6 weeks. Not possible. Don't understand how you get it to 8 weeks left.<br />
Even if I do the daily heroic everyday I will still need 9-10k Valor Points I think.<br />
<br />
There are tons of useless items with no purpose in the game and on vendors, so I don't see why this one should be taken away. Would be something to do with valor points in the future if(when) they bring them back.</div></div><hr />

You can buy the upgrade (the 3 ilvl legendary upgrader), from an NPC in tannan with 1250 valor Mate. You can run Normal Arch with a pug easily right now and get one just from the boss kill. You can buy 3 of those 3ilvl upgraders per week with max valor + the one from Arch X 8 weeks = 32. I mean Obviously you only need 11. You can get 11 from valor alone in 4 weeks or less</div></div><hr />

<br />
11 Upgrades, lets do some math:<br />
<br />
- Each upgrade costs 1250 Valor. 1250*11 = 13750 Valor<br />
- Each Mythic Dungeon gives 300 valor per week. 300*8 = 2400 Valor<br />
- First daily Heroic Dungeon gives 100 valor, each week has 7 days. 100*7 = 700 Valor<br />
- Each weekly event quest gives 500 valor. 500*1 = 500 Valor<br />
- Doing all LFR wings from Highmaul to Hellfire Citadel gives 1250 valor each week. 1250*1 = 1250 Valor<br />
<br />
Total = 2400+700+500+1250 = 4850 Valor per week. <br />
<br />
13750/4850 = 2.835051 Weeks<br />
<br />
So you will need around 3 weeks to get those 11 ring upgrades if you really want it :)<br />
<br />
OBS: You can skip a bit by pugging Normal Archimonde for that 1 extra Ring upgrade each week.</div></div><hr />

You're a completionist yet you don't go beyond LFR? Sounds like you're a moaner to me. A moaner is someone that cries for attention. They also have nasty habits of embellishing in order to draw a pity party.</div></div><hr />

Yes, obviously I know you can buy the upgrade from the vendor in Tanaan as it is the only upgrade I can get my hands on as I don't get in raids.<br />
It is the upgrade from that NPC I have used to upgrade to the 762 ilvl I have now. So a lot of boring LFR runs :P<br />
<br />
As I said... I don't raid, so I don't do mythic dungeons either. From what I can see you need achievements for everything and high ilvl(I have like 706 or so). That's how it is on my realm atleast and what I can see in LFG groups.<br />
So I have daily dungeon + LFR + weekly event some weeks(pet battles next week, so no valor and I don't do mythic dungeons week either).<br />

Edit:<br />
My point isn't really that I have to complete it or I will start crying, but that I don't see any reason to remove a grind for an item that will not be used in Legion. It's not like people would hold on leveling when Legion comes until they have farmed valor for the first few weeks just so they could completely upgrade their ring because they would refuse to level with a ring that isn't fully upgraded - and I don't think anyone would really care if someone else would be able to fully upgrade their ring or not.</div></div><hr />

Would be a great idea if WoD lore didnt suck.<br />

<br />
They've not been terribly consistent, to be honest. <br />
<br />
You can still get the achievement mounts from Ulduar 10 and 25, same with ICC, but they removed the ones from Naxx in the middle of that expansion. Most of the achievement mounts from ICC on are still in the game (minus the wolf from Garrosh), and the ones that were 100% drop rates from the bosses are still in but now are low drop rate items...<br />
<br />
And then you have the Grove Warden, which works differently than the others - it's a 100% drop item that starts a quest for everyone there, which is different than what they've done before, and it's going away permanently when the expansion launches, which they've really only done twice (and only one of those was expansion related).<br />
<br />
Removing mounts from end of expansion bosses entirely is a relatively new trend as far as WoW goes.</div></div><hr />

They won't announce it until a couple days before because they don't like announcing the dates for things should they have to be held back for any reason. It's highly likely that it will be July 19th, and should nothing go wrong on their end between now and then, it will.</div></div><hr />

There is something very wrong if you need to raid to do mythic dungeons and even more wrong if you need more than 706 item level. Just lose 10 minutes of your life watching a guide on those mythic dungeons and make your own group in the LFG tool.<br />

You can still get the achievement mounts from Ulduar 10 and 25, same with ICC, but they removed the ones from Naxx in the middle of that expansion. Most of the achievement mounts from ICC on are still in the game (minus the wolf from Garrosh), and the ones that were 100% drop rates from the bosses are still in but now are low drop rate items...<br />
<br />
And then you have the Grove Warden, which works differently than the others - it's a 100% drop item that starts a quest for everyone there, which is different than what they've done before, and it's going away permanently when the expansion launches, which they've really only done twice (and only one of those was expansion related).<br />
<br />
Removing mounts from end of expansion bosses entirely is a relatively new trend as far as WoW goes.<br />
<br />
You're right though, I was thinking the 100% vs low drop chance, but you're correct - it is indeed still in game (just like a 1-3% drop rate which TO ME.. is hella RIP).<br />
<br />
I guess I kind of like it being removed, and I'm not even a special snowflake, I just feel like if you played during this time period - you have a token (That I won't even use anyway lolooo) showing you played from x to y time. I mean, literally - I see people selling it for 15,000 in trade, and these are good groups of vape nation mythic geared people burning the boss in like 4 minutes flat. To me, I agree that working TOWARDS a yolo kill from LFG, sure that sucks ass, I wouldn't wish that on anyone.. But just by selling a champion's honor from your garrison on the ah, and buying a kill - I think is just a way of basically BUYING the mount for 15k. I don't mean to sound mean I'm just saying: may as well just use some of that 5,000,000 gold you have stacked instead of letting it sit with your 11 wow tokens you already bought..</div></div><hr />

You can't be racist against orcs. They're not a real race, so don't get all offended Ogrim.</div></div><hr />

It is the upgrade from that NPC I have used to upgrade to the 762 ilvl I have now. So a lot of boring LFR runs :P<br />
<br />
As I said... I don't raid, so I don't do mythic dungeons either. From what I can see you need achievements for everything and high ilvl(I have like 706 or so). That's how it is on my realm atleast and what I can see in LFG groups.<br />
So I have daily dungeon + LFR + weekly event some weeks(pet battles next week, so no valor and I don't do mythic dungeons week either).<br />

Yes, I'm a wood completionist with a low functioning brain, you all mighty pro player :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
My point isn't really that I have to complete it or I will start crying, but that I don't see any reason to remove a grind for an item that will not be used in Legion. It's not like people would hold on leveling when Legion comes until they have farmed valor for the first few weeks just so they could completely upgrade their ring because they would refuse to level with a ring that isn't fully upgraded - and I don't think anyone would really care if someone else would be able to fully upgrade their ring or not.<br />
<br />
You have to raid to have that legendary though #trollface ;) - I hear what you're saying. I just think if you want the 795 maxed out: you have more than enough time to max that puppy out if you really wanted it. AGAIN, I am feeling your side of the fence - they COULD keep it in the game, but they aren't. I've missed out on a ton of stuff, and I'm decently active on a casual standpoint as well - but I just make sacrifices when it comes to what I want vs. what I spend my time on/fun/etc imo<br />
