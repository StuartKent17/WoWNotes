this. probably because you could use haste effects before applying sw:p and then just refresh it with mindflay and it wouldnt loose the haste effect. lazy fix is lazy<br />

It's in the tooltip. It may have been in shadowform before, I'm not sure - regardless, all three dots are in there. So, not so lazy.</div></div><hr />

I just logged on the PTR to test it out. Sure enough DP and VT benefit from Haste.<br />
<br />
SWP DOES NOT...<br />
<br />
so much for hoping shadow priests would get some decent buffs...<br />

<br />
Would this make sense? If true, why would they patch this with 3.3 for no reason else then that this patch will still be live with Love is in the Air?<br />
<br />
And I dearly hope that Shadowform is not going live. Although Shadow does not really need a buff. It just requires too much attention.</div></div><hr />

Im really really hoping that its a typo, or something to fuck with peoples heads. Obtaining it from arthas might imply something of a redemption (dont flame me i odnt want it) and that would turn icc into a giant old flop for me, i came to kill a douchebag with a cursed sword, i dont want him to go out a good guy, cos then i feel like the bad guy...
