Patch 5.4 Unannounced Feature<br />
I just read on MMO champion that the 'unannounced feature' for patch 5.4 is essentially knifed in the belly. As I'm reading the tweets GC suggests that he wishes he never said anything about it or any features for that matter. Stating that when he announces a new feature or functionality within the game and it doesn't pan out or arrive in time the community gets upset.<br />
<br />
My response to that is, &quot;What .. are you going to just say nothing?&quot; <br />
<br />
*Patch 5.4 includes ... &lt;Find out on patch day cause we ain't saying nothin!&gt;*<br />
<br />
It may let down some yes, BUT its far better to tell us your plans, visions, direction and ideas and fall short than simply not saying anything. The first lets me know you guys are still creative, ambitious and still trying to push this game forward which has a greater chance to keep my subscription. The second makes me think you guys are lazy, don't give a damn and not confident in your abilities. <br />
Here's the issue we run into regularly. If we share incomplete information or &quot;hint&quot; at something without proper context, some people end up being disappointed when what they had in their head isn't what ends up being implemented. <br />
<br />
Things change while in development. That means that even if we do give advanced information, it could change, and for some, that change may be construed as &quot;worse&quot; whether they've actually experienced it pre-change or not.<br />
<br />
You may not mind when things change. Many people don't, but from our experience, most people tend to be a bit happier when they can get a more complete picture. I can assure you, the implication that the development team in any way shape or form is being &quot;lazy&quot; is far from reality. We're still working on many things at current and will do our best to get the information out to everyone at what is hopefully the best possible time, with the most accurate information possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Titan Runestone Drop Rate Change<br />
We agree and feel that Titan Runestones drop too rarely. We are going to make some changes to Lei Shen. <br />
<br />
For players that are on the legendary quest line, Lei Shen will now always drop a Titan Runestone. This is similar to what we did with rare drops in the past and will help players that have been experiencing really bad luck.<br />
<br />
This change is still undergoing testing and is scheduled to take effect next Tuesday with the raid resets.<br />
<br />

Patch 5.3 Hotfixes - June 5<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where players did not receive a http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/98134.jpg Heroic Cache of Treasures (http://www.wowdb.com/items/98134-heroic-cache-of-treasures) for completing the first Heroic Scenario of the day if they had completed a Normal Scenario first.<br />

I'm tired of doing the fkng dailies? We are all tired of doing this. We play game to have fun, not tired.<br />
So don't do them? What is the specific reward that you feel requires you to run so many dailies? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/333289889850351616))<br />
Bad &quot;professional&quot; answer. you made your game revolve around them.(kind of sound naïve about your own game sir.<br />
My point is if you earn 500 valor a week instead of 1000 a week, you'll still get gear or upgrades, just at a slower rate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335556512896413698))<br />
Been challenging for us when folks who play 2 hours a night and folks who play 2 a week want to progress at similar rates. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335557404089532417))<br />
All guilds with some progression will require you to cap each week. You can't log only to do what you like.<br />
I'm in a heroic guild, and the officers would never mandate everyone cap valor and charms. To each his or her own I guess. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/335801911636803584))<br />
<br />
crap answer. Maybe Mr. Heroic raider doesn't need valor gear, but some of us lesser fools do.<br />
But why do you *need* valor gear? And even if you do, you can still earn it even if you skip dailies completely. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332637209171738626))<br />
Valor gear = stronger and more powerful toon, gear is everything, higher the ILVL the better, correct me if im wrong<br />
That sounds like a want, not a need. I'm just trying to understand the argument. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332666427192524800))<br />
It's a need if you dont want to be barred from every guild or get kicked after you come up last in an LFR boss fight<br />
If you are coming up last in an LFR boss fight, it's not the lack of valor gear.... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337985442777554944))<br />
It seems to be &quot;I need max valor to progress, but I don't want to participate in the most efficient avenues to accrue it.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332666775282008064))<br />
When the alternatives to just accrue valor slower or less efficiently seem reasonable. What am I missing? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/332667008984424449))<br />
It seems to be &quot;People always take the most efficient path so lets make it as boring as possible&quot;<br />
We think having lots of dungeons to run is less boring than doing Mechanar every night. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338119284964343808))<br />
<br />
How was daily limit removal a mistake? Putting in 100 dailies was the mistake...<br />
This is &quot;don't nanny us&quot; vs. &quot;I have too much to do&quot; conundrum I referenced the other day. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338373020928331776))<br />
<br />
Realize you're telling me &quot;WoW isn't for you&quot; because every patch seems to be a rep grind and dailies.<br />
You have to ignore a lot of content to say that is all our patches have been about. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338043077040160768))<br />
I really don't get people harping on about it, there hasn't been a daily rep with useful gear since 5.1<br />
Depends what other gear you have access to. It can't be rewarding for both heroic raiders and folks in blues. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338117565035470848))<br />
5.2 had gear same ilvl as 5.1. Barrens has gear lower ilvl. Most of it feels wasted even on LFR players.<br />
We heard from a lot of players who didn't want to have to raid or wanted catch up for their alts that wasn't 5.0 reputations. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338120573836218369))<br />
You mentioned story gating working well (5.1, 5.2). 5.3´s story was over in a day. Way less interested in doing stuff now.<br />
Part of our faster development cycle means that 5.3 was pretty far along before we could evaluate 5.1 and 5.2 player reaction. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338370472909611009))<br />
<br />
We believe you will have more fun if you find a group of friends, and we will try to do more to enable that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338347196946718720))<br />
try that at 3am and you're the only one on the server<br />
That's why we provide ways to play solo as well. We would just like to lure you into groups of friends. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338360231060967424))<br />
<br />
does dynamic open world scenarios similar to public quests in warhammer online sound like a good alternate to dailies?<br />
Potentially. We're dabbling that with the Battlefield Barrens stuff and plan to do more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338365762148384770))<br />
<br />
Random q: Have you thought about creating tech for &quot;auto-grouping&quot; if people are completing the same quest in a fixed area?<br />
We've considered it. I think you'd have to be really careful not to force players into groups if they weren't interested. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336601229008441345))<br />
<br />
What is designed to be the most effective/fastest way to level? Quests, Instances, PvP, etc.? I<br />
Ideally doing a variety of tasks, but we always want to make sure questing remains attractive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/337724805379915777))<br />
What is it about questing you find more appealing? Don't you think by 90 people are pretty sick of questing?<br />
The question was about what we want to be the most effective way to level. The answer is 1) variety, 2) quests. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338012715580801026))<br />
At max level, we want players to have a reason to go out into the world. Quests are one way to do that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338012805829652481))<br />
But we didn't have many alternatives to max quests at launch. Patch 5.3 and 5.4 have more outdoor options. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338012935119073280))<br />
The Barrens has a lot of content, but not a lot of quests. The next patch will have an even more ambitious area. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/338013245816320000))<br />
<br />
How popular has Sunsong Ranch been this expansion? More or less popular than expected? Will we see something like it again?<br />
More popular than expected. We'd like to do something again but not an exact clone. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/336249999652421632))<br />

The Music of Mists: an Interview with Russell Brower<br />
The Blizzard Music section has been updated to include the soundtrack to World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/music/wow-mists-of-pandaria.html). When you visit the page, you’ll be able to read notes from the soundtracks’ composers, listen to song samples, and download albums and individual tracks directly through iTunes.<br />
<br />
To provide more insight on the development of this auditory (pandaren) feast, we sat down with Senior Director of Audio Russell Brower to talk about the making of the Mists of Pandaria soundtrack and his views on the purpose of music in games. Read on for the full conversation below!<br />
<br />
Q: The role of sound and music in games, even in our games, isn’t always clear. Is there anything you’d like to tell players about what your team does?<br />
A: (Russell Brower): I believe our players already have a great appreciation for the role of sound and music in games. A healthy portion of our players can’t imagine a Blizzard game without what we do. Sound and music aren’t always an essential part of gameplay, but Blizzard wouldn’t ship a game without them, just like we wouldn’t ship a game without great cinematics.<br />
<br />
We’re a visual society; we take our hearing for granted unless it’s taken away from us. It’s the first sense that’s turned on in the womb, and, unless something breaks with your hearing, it’s on for the rest of your life. Marty O’Donnell, a good buddy of mine who’s my counterpart at Bungie, has a saying: “the ear does not blink.” Sound is a constant immersion tool—voiceover has to be localized, but music doesn’t, and sound effects don’t—they’re a universal language.<br />
<br />
Also, the team strives to keep people from turning their sound off. There will always be hardcore players who’ll never have sound on; they’re in voice chat, or they need absolute focus. I feel like that’s a frontier we have yet to conquer, but also, as social gaming continues to put people in closer contact with each other, the challenge of sound to remain immersive is only gonna get tougher.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Q: Do you find that players get bothered by game sounds with any regularity? Where does that concern stem from?<br />
A: Well, for example, we’ve had to tone down our auto-playing sounds to be less startling. We found that some people will put headphones on, and after two hours of installing, suddenly the game will go “BOOM!!” when it finishes. People started to install games with the sound off.<br />
<br />
Q: Right! When you hear one of those thundering installation complete sounds, it's like, “ack, did a bookshelf fall over?”<br />
A: For our Cataclysm update, 4.3, you heard horns when the update was completed—it was a bit more easy-going. Another example: a LOT of people hated Sindragosa’s constant roaring on the Wrath of the Lich King title screen. So, when we were scoping out Cataclysm, we thought, “oh, man, not another dragon update!” We actually got the World of Warcraft team to keep him mostly quiet. It was a fight, but then we saw far fewer complaints. With the MoP login screen, I’ve seen a lot of grateful comments. I’ve had a lot of people on Twitter tell me that they actually waited and listened to the entire piece of music before logging in.<br />
<br />
Q: What instrumentation did you use for the MoP soundtrack? It sounds very different from what we’ve heard in other World of Warcraft expansions.<br />
A: We supplemented the usual palette of sounds rather than replace it. That stemmed from a conversation I had with Chris Metzen early on; we were looking at all the gorgeous artwork and art direction of Pandaria, and he said, “the artwork is telling us we’re in a different world, a place of wonder, but one that will potentially get conquered by the Alliance and Horde.” He felt that we needed an Asian overlay, but that the soundtrack was also an opportunity to remind us that we’re still in Azeroth. We shouldn’t go so far afield that it doesn’t feel like Warcraft.<br />
<br />
So, we kept our usual palette of epic orchestral sounds, but we added some specific Chinese instruments. One is the erhu, which is basically a Chinese fiddle; it’s got 2 strings, and an almost vocal vibrato singing quality. We also added the guzheng, which is like a harp, but it’s long and laid out flat. It’s both strummed and plucked. The third instrument was called the dizi—you know how if you pluck a blade of grass and blow on it, you get that reedy sound? Well, the Dizi has a hole in it with a membrane that vibrates, and so it sounds like a flute, but it has this very buzzy overtone. We also included one more—the pipa, which is more or less the Chinese version of the banjo. Those four instruments, along with Chinese drums, gave us the overlay we needed to have a bit of Asian feel. We also changed the orchestra’s playing style—even when we were using familiar instrumentation, we had a bit more sliding between notes at certain times. In some ways, it’s what Hollywood has told us Asian music sounds like, but some of it’s authentic. Those Chinese instruments were all played by masters.<br />
<br />
Q: Oh, so this isn’t you guys picking up an instrument for the first time?<br />
A: Oh, no. Luckily, in California, you can get instrument experts fairly locally. Everyone was local except for the arhu player, who we flew in from the Bay area. In China, she’s considered a major star—she actually teaches, and also plays violin. So, she’s able to play in the language of Hollywood, but also with the personality of her instrument. We would typically say to her, “ok, play it idiomatically correct this time; ok, now play it like a violin.” In editing, we got to pick and choose, because there were times when the idiomatic version was so heavily vibrato or ornamented that it might actually call too much attention to itself. It’s the role of music to support and immerse, not to say “hey, listen to me!” We’ve actually failed if the music is calling too much attention to itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/june/thumb/music02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/june/music02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Q: Can you elaborate on that sentiment? What do you think the role of music is in gameplay? Guiding or instructing a player, providing cues—is that something you think game music should or shouldn’t do? Where does our music influence our gameplay?<br />
A: It depends on the game, but in our games, certainly in World of Warcraft and Diablo, the music adds to the immersion. I think in Diablo it’s a little more about mood, where we want to enhance the creepiness, until we get to the cinematics, and then we get to character development. There’s a theme for Diablo, and there’s a theme for Leah.<br />
<br />
WoW has even more of that—there are very specific melodic devices and tone colors for Alliance and Horde, and for some of our major figures. Arthas has an arc coming from Warcraft III, where a melody was first established more than 10 years ago, and that DNA is in the song &quot;Invincible.&quot; In fact, it’s the chorus. There are new verses, but the chorus came from 10+ years ago.<br />
<br />
StarCraft’s a different animal in that the gameplay is so fast—it’s very strategic, but there’s a little bit more ‘twitch’ gameplay involved, so the music needs to stay out of the way. The map music is really just there to make the game cooler—where the music gets critical in StarCraft is in the cinematics. Starting with the original StarCraft, each race had a very identifiable musical signature, and that carried over to the maps and played a part in cinematics. Wings of Liberty is where we really started establishing themes for characters. While Raynor is synonymous with the part of the Terran race that listens to space-cowboy trucker music, he ended up with his own theme in Wings of Liberty. We’d started some Zerg stuff in Wings, but it’s fully developed in Heart of the Swarm, and we’ll see that happen again with Legacy of the Void for the Protoss. We established a melody for Zeratul in Wings, and that’ll carry over and get developed, too.<br />
<br />
So, the role of music, in WoW especially, is closer to its role in a movie, in that we can convey what would take too many words to describe otherwise. When you read a book, you can get inside a character’s head and hear what they’re thinking. In a game, we really don’t have that luxury—they’d have to talk too much, and we’d have to localize it, and it’d stop gameplay. We want to stop gameplay as infrequently as we can. Music doesn’t have to be translated—people say that it can tell you how you’re supposed to feel, and I suppose that’s true sometimes, but sometimes it amplifies what’s already there.<br />
<br />
Q: Yeah. You see a sweeping vista, and the score emphasizes the grand scale of it all.<br />
A: All rules are meant to be broken, though, so sometimes you play against type. There’ve been moments in StarCraft where a character has done something awful, and he’s listening to opera. It’s the classic gangster-movie juxtaposition. Similarly, some of the music in StarCraft, this space game, could be considered “spaghetti western.” It’s a nice genre flip, especially for someone who’s not expecting it.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Q: There’s a track on the Mists of Pandaria soundtrack called “The Traveler’s Path,” which sounds like it contains a conlang, an invented language. Is that accurate?<br />
A: Yes. We went to our Creative Development team, and, for certain NPC responses, they’d already begun to spin a language, and we asked them to flesh out some words in English that [Lead Quest Designer] Dave Kosak had written. It’s the story of Liu Leng, and the turtle, Shen-sin-zu, and why Liu Leng left Pandaria and came back. I was inspired by a video of Dave doing what he called “story time,” where he told the story of Liu Leng, and when I realized that part of the player experience was that you weren’t necessarily going to realize you were on a turtle until you got on a balloon and went around the island and saw his face for the first time in a mini cut-scene. So I thought, “why not write a song that tells the story of Liu Leng?”<br />
<br />
When I was a little kid in choir, we learned a Japanese song called Sakura—it was easy for kids to learn and remember, so I wanted to find the Pandaren equivalent of that—a melody so simple that it could be an ancient folk song, one where the words could change over the centuries. In this case, Lorewalker Cho would be singing the part of Liu Leng, so we asked Creative Dev to basically translate the story, and then we went through a process of vetting it with the localization guys to make sure we weren’t inadvertently saying something offensive in Chinese or any other language.<br />
<br />
Dave was so excited that he made a whole quest line around the song. It only happens at certain times; you go out to a little beach where Lorewalker Cho’s waiting, you sit down in front of him and he sings the song, and places all these paper boats in the water, and it’s just this gorgeous thing. Yeah, we focus on gameplay first, but for those who care to venture off the beaten path a little bit, you’ll find this special moment.<br />
<br />
When I worked at Disney they called these sorts of things ‘discovery places.’ At Disneyland, if you happened to go around the right corner, you’d find Snow White’s wishing well, a fountain, and her singing voice coming from the fountain. It’s a little thing, it makes no money, but they did it because that’s what that park does. Blizzard has a similar sensibility—we want to give our audience the little things alongside the epic ones.<br />
<br />
Q: How does the inspiration exchange work for you and your team? You talked about being inspired by art—at what point during the development process do you usually get concept art?<br />
A: As early as we can. Before production begins, we pretty much need to have done our homework. When production begins, it’s too late to be designing—at that point, we need to be implementing, because things move fast. During the time from when we first get a glimmer of the next expansion, patch or feature, we cast the voices, we go, “the next expansion is about zerg, so we need a lot more *glorp* sounds, we need to expand that vocabulary.”<br />
<br />
Q: And then you begin casting?<br />
A: For Mists of Pandaria, casting was a big-time effort. We went with the Screen Actor’s Guild for the game so that we could get access to the best actors and authentic accents. For the music, even though we hired master players for several of our instruments, we had to learn to write for them. The instruments were designed to play traditional Chinese music, and they have ranges that don’t necessarily hit all of the same notes as the instruments we’re more familiar with. We had to do some funky things, like the Arhu player would play everything but two notes in a given phrase; then, for those two notes, we would go to a different track, she would retune the instrument, and we’d punch in the missing notes. In the case of the Pipa, the Chinese banjo, most of it we were able to write around the range of the instrument, but there were a couple of things that I just wanted that were a little below its range. We [whispering conspiratorially] actually used a banjo for those. I defy anyone to tell.<br />
<br />
Another instrument we used—who knew that the musical saw was a traditional Chinese instrument? It turns out it’s not, but I was looking for a very specific sound…<br />
<br />
During Dave Kosak’s story time, he talked about how the Jinyu place their staves in the water to consult the river, which led to a piece on the soundtrack called ‘Go Ask the River.’ If you’re wondering what the high, wobbly melody note in that song is, that’s a saw. A Sears Craftsman saw. The saw player puts the saw down, holds the handle between his legs, and bends the blade, with the teeth facing him, and he uses a violin bow to bow the saw, then changes the pitch by bending and wobbling it. You may have heard of a theremin; this is sweeter and more vocal because it’s not made electronically, so there’s no static sound. I was a little worried that people would go, “oh, what’s a theremin doing here” and make Forbidden Planet jokes, but so far, no one’s mentioned the word to me, so it seems to have worked. In Mists of Pandaria, whenever you’re around a body of water that might be mystical or hold knowledge of the future or visions of the past for the Jinyu or Shaohao, you’ll hear that singing saw. We had two saws—a 14-inch one and a 20-inch one, and our saw player called them his “alto” and “tenor” saws.<br />
<br />

<br />
Q: On the Mists of Pandaria soundtrack you blend several songs together and segue from one track to the next. Is that designed to reflect zone transitions in games, or did you compose it as one continuous piece?<br />
<br />
A: We did seven-and-a-half hours of music for Mists of Pandaria—that brings WoW up to a total of 45 hours of music, including over 12 hours of ambient music (which is actually really fun to listen to in a playlist). Those hours are made up of many hundreds and hundreds of individual music cues. In fact, on Mists of Pandaria, I hit a personal milestone and I wrote my 1000th piece of music for WoW.<br />
<br />
Our first soundtrack from brown box (original or ‘classic’ World of Warcraft) produced a lot of music that’s amazing and iconic, and we’re still building on it today, but it was arranged in groups—city themes, big moments, zone tracks—and they were more or less in alphabetical order. It was a ‘record’ in the sense of being a historical document, but it wasn’t arranged as an album. Starting with The Burning Crusade, we felt like we wanted to let our albums have a life outside the game.<br />
<br />
The original brown box only had about 2 hours of music for the entire game. To make an album, they pretty much had to put almost the entire soundtrack on it. Now, we put out anywhere from 6-8 hours of music per expansion, and around an hour per patch. Ulduar was almost 2 hours. Not all of our 7 hours of music really works outside of the game—some of it is fairly ambient—but we can use a few notes to paint a mental picture, and put those tracks in a ‘story’ order that builds on related ideas and concepts. A given cut that’s several minutes long might be made up of anywhere from 1 to 5 or 6 cues from the game, and we spend a lot of time crafting nice segues and finding ways to get from one cue to another that take you on a journey without jarring you.<br />
<br />
I also think about the album as a whole—making sure we don’t include too many slow or loud pieces in a row. Obviously, if everything’s epic and bold, then epic and bold begins to lose its meaning. Music is about contrast; a loud thing will appear louder if it’s preceded by silence. I literally draw a graph on paper, and go “with this lineup of pieces, we’ve got a nice rollercoaster going, then a big buildup, then right before the end it kind of gets slow, and then it ends at 11.” It’s a conscious decision to have the album stand alone outside the game, so people can play it in their car when they’re not playing the game if they want to take a piece of World of Warcraft with them.<br />
<br />
When I cut the music together for the Burning Crusade album, I got the idea to put in just a hint of the ambience: our ambient tracks are really compelling in and of themselves, they’re beautiful and actually you hear them more than you hear ‘music’ in the game since the ambience never shuts off. The music kind of materializes out of the ambience and then recedes back into it. On The Burning Crusade, Derek Duke did this wonderful music for the Draenei. It was very pastoral, to represent the shimmering, glowing crystals that power their homes. It’s almost spiritual music. On the soundtrack, leading into it, I included a hint of the ambience from their starting zone, and then later the ambience from the Exodar, and it became a tradition after that. I did the same thing for the soundtrack albums for the other franchises, but it works best on WoW.<br />
<br />
They’re all gapless albums—the only time there’s a gap is when it’s good showmanship. Going back to The Burning Crusade, the only gap is before ‘Lament of the Highborne,’ and the previous cut is ‘Taverns,’ which is almost out of left field. Then there’s a two-second gap, and then Lament of the Highborne. The album doesn’t end on a high, but with a reaching or yearning.<br />
<br />
For Mists of Pandaria, Jeremy Soule did this piece which wound up being for the series of dailies you do when you’re riding a cloud serpent—the mechanic is like a bombing run mission, and you end up with a serpent mount at the end of the quest chain. I conducted the piece at Nokia, and it’s just really cool, so that became the capstone of the album. That’s deliberate.<br />

Thank you, sir! I was hoping I wasn't the only one feeling this way. GC mentioned a new feature. Everyone went crazy with speculation. Then he was like, &quot;Woah, guys. Take a step back. I won't mention anything about this again, so let's not get all worked up.&quot; .. To which the community responded, &quot;OH! Now you're DELETING the content?!

See, that's the thing... it didn't.<br />
<br />
Some people here need to work on their reading comprehension... Ghostcrawler basically said &quot;I'm not going to say EXACTLY what it is.&quot; He did NOT say &quot;whatever it was, it wont appear in game.&quot; <br />
<br />
Instead of SAYING that the unannounced feature is &quot;X,&quot; and then having people say &quot;awww, that's lame, I was expecting X2!&quot; he's saying &quot;it might be X, Y, or Z&quot; so people can say &quot;Well gee, Z is pretty cool, I bet that was it.&quot; <br />

<br />
Blizzard, whether or intentional or not, started the hype.<br />
<br />
The original &quot;reveal&quot; of the unannounced feature was following this question:<br />
<br />
&quot;Wotlk gave us the random dungeon finder, cata gave us LFR. Which new mop feature do you think has had/will have a huge impact?&quot;<br />
<br />
His response: &quot;We haven't announced it yet.:)&quot;<br />
<br />
That's not him saying that it will be &quot;small, nothing major.&quot; In fact, that's implying (whether the implication was intentional or not) that it will be a major feature. Staying silent and letting people's imagination take over since then, of course, led to it gaining even more hype (if anyone is surprised this happened, you clearly have no knowledge of how easily hype builds when you have scant details, or how quickly the imagination fills gaps in interesting ways - the latter is, after all, the basis for the best horror stories...lack of information), but let's not act like GC didn't get the original hype ball rolling on this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it didn't get scratched. GC told everyone to calm down a bit since there was no way the new feature could live up to the hype. Then he said that it might make people feel better if they considered their favorite part of the 5.4 patch to be the 'unannounced feature'. That got extrapolated to &quot;OMG GC just said the feature is cancelled!!!1One!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
And I'm sure quite a number of people hate you. And no, they didn't up the drop rate yet. You're just one of the lucky few that got very, very lucky. That's kind of like someone who matched all of the numbers on a lottery ticket asking if the odds of winning had been improved.</div></div><hr />

I can understand how reading comprehension can be tricky. It's the nature of the beast, to be able to understand the information sliding through your eyelids takes a extra large serving of effort. First quote talks about how GC can't talk about the new feature and how it's still planned for release in 5.4. Second quote is him addressing the overhype that's being generated. A tranq shot removes the enrage debuff. Hence, people going crazy... using wow terminology to make them calm down. Even speaking your language, you still have no idea what he is saying.<br />
<br />
Nothing has been cancelled, turned around, etc.<br />

Honestly, the people giving grief to GC over Twitter are exaggerating and giving the most absolute scenarios that aren't true at all. Hyperbole is an angry WoW player's best friend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same with GC's unannouced 5.4 change. He's trying to ramp down the hype, and all he's getting in responce is abuse. If he didn't, he'd get abuse for overhyping something (even though he didn't). It would be Hearthstone all over all (which ironically people are now excited for).</div></div><hr />

This is so dead wrong it's not even funny. Someone said &quot;We had Transmog and LFR in Cata, what is MoPs big feature that will have a &quot;huge impact&quot; and Ghostcrawler said , &quot;it isnt out yet :)&quot; or something like that. If they didnt expect it to be something big like LFR he wouldn't of just made a remark of confirmation, he could of taken care of the question immediately by saying there was no such feature OR we have many smaller features not just one big one because we want people to have a variety of things to do (just using the usual blizzard word vomit as an example)<br />

It’s the role of music to support and immerse, not to say “hey, listen to me!” We’ve actually failed if the music is calling too much attention to itself.<br />
Vale music fits that description, that's why I replaced it. It's just too aggressive for a place where you stand around for hours.<br />
<br />
On The Burning Crusade, Derek Duke did this wonderful music for the Draenei. It was very pastoral, to represent the shimmering, glowing crystals that power their homes. It’s almost spiritual music.<br />
<br />
Ooh yes... I'm still addicted to that music after 6 years.... So addicted that I replaced the vales music with these pieces. ^^</div></div><hr />

Not to mention ALL the things they said afterwards as well in various different interviews:<br />
<br />
- It's something we often spoke about<br />
- People seem to like running old content, this will fall in line with that<br />
- It's going to give people a lot of new content to do<br />
- It's going to offer an alternative way of progressing your character<br />
<br />
Tranq shot my ass... sounds more like they scrapped their plans for it and are now pretending they never intended on releasing anything, trying to blame it -once again- on the community (to make it more toxic than it already is), instead of taking responsibility for their own actions.<br />
<br />
Dats your speculation, yet it doesn't mean that is what it is or was. The Community is toxic itself &amp; the only way it can be fixed is if those people who make it toxic leave. All these dam whiners are the main reason the community sucks donkey, demanding everything without any effort, refusing to learn anything to get better.</div></div><hr />

I'm in-raid on voice-com I keep the volume so it's slightly softer than voice-com. Audible through voicecom for cues, but so the softest spoken person on vent can be heard of it.<br />
<br />
If I'm soloing for an extended period, I tend to turn the audio up &amp; I'm also 50/50 likely to turn the music back on. I'll virtually always turn the music on for a new expac.<br />
<br />
Prior to Cataclysm - and the goblin inn tune in particular - I would've been vastly less likely to ever turn the music back on even while soloing. I think the music has become richer and more pleasingly interwoven over the years.</div></div><hr />

In pvp its helps a ton to hear whats going on. <br />
And hows it fun if u cant hear when ppl do /train?<br />
<br />
And the music kinda enhances everything. It creates the environment. If its a creepy place, u hear creeoy music etc.<br />
All in all theres just so much that ppl are missing if they play without sounds.<br />

Also, I remember when I was in Brill once, really close to the bell. Damn did I get scared when it rang. Would have missed if Id played w/o sounds :P<br />

<br />
I disagree. Running Mech over and over was more fun than sleep walking through the dungeons of the last three expansions over and over. Indeed, the whole semi-tier of content between dinging 70 and getting established in Karazhan was one of the best times I had in WoW, if not the outright best. It was fun and challenging, but progress was steady and clever play was rewarded. Also, the sky was the limit was for all but a few elite players, there was a lot of content in the game that lay in front of us. Contrast that with today, where everyone dings max level in a week, is facerolling &quot;heroic&quot; dungeons the next, and soon facerolling LFR not long after.<br />
<br />
There is another advantage to stretching out the heroic/crafted/rep tier and keeping people out of the first raid while - it allows subsequent raids to be held back a bit longer, and ultimately shorten the gap after the last raid, which is inevitably too long. Blizz should tune the first tier raids such that they presume you are more or less fully geared with heroic, crafted, and exhalted gear, make the heroics at least reasonably heroic, and set the expectation that most players won't be ready for the first raid for 2-3 months after the expansion starts.</div></div><hr />

I think that all the hype has generated a lot of theories and guesses as to what it is. A lot of people are convinced it will be something and Blizz reads the forums and knows it's not that. To keep us from getting disappointed, they want us to reel it back in. They realize that a lot of the things people are hoping it's going to be, are not what it will be and these people are so convinced that they will go into a blind fanatical rage if it's anything but what they want.

They need to generate buzz in interviews. It's called marketing. However this time they're reading the shit that people want and they think it's too much. Have you read all the threads people have been posting? The MOBA pvp/pve thing? Old raids in LFR? Scaled old raids? Cross faction LFR/LFG? Vanilla/BC servers? Updated old races? Free to play? There are so many other theories and every one of them believe 100% that this is what is the new feature in 5.4! All of these ideas are good, but obviously not even similar to each other so if it's not all of them, these people will be massively disappointed.<br />

Just when he makes jokes to try and put it in a lighter mood, the terrible community jumps all over it with it's inability to comprehend anything it reads. Then they get all up in arms over nothing. Missing the point GC is trying to convey, even trying to speak to us in wow terms. I just feel bad for the guy.

<br />
They tried having &quot;challenge&quot; in the first tier of heroics for max level in Cataclysm. They wound up having to nerf them and lower the barrier of entry into the first tier of raiding because the masses who had previously complained about how heroics were too easy were now complaining about them being overly difficult.<br />
<br />
It's easy to look back and think fondly of the good times of TBC. The truth is, a lot of people hated that it was so hard to get into heroic (and initially non-heroic, max level) dungeons and succeed then too. The problem with this game is mostly centered around a community made up of entitled gamers that want it both ways. They want to feel elite because they have cooler/better/bigger gear/achievements/etc than other people. But they also (generally) don't want the work that comes with that sort of setup. I know you may be the exception to that, so I'm not saying you're in that category. But the gaming community in general likes to say they want challenge, but really what they want is to feel special with little effort. Blizzard's constant struggle to find a balance between those two has produced where we are today.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the old way was &quot;better&quot; or not, but I do not envy the position they are in when it comes to pleasing the community.</div></div><hr />

Because it's an mmo and I talk in vent/mumble with my guildies. If I want to listen to music I can go listen to actually good music from bands I like.

<br />
And on the flip side if they don't cap it, there will people they feel the 'need' to run every ounce of content that provides valor/conquest every week so they might get the most they can, and prices of items will reflect that possibility. Much worse burnout. Back in Wrath, prices were built on the possibility that someone was running their daily dungeon, and doing both 10 man and 25 man in the same week.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is a shady company anymore there is no denying it. You don't hype the hell out of a &quot;Unannounced feature&quot; all x-pac than try to kill it last min. Not the first time Blizzard didn't deliver. Hell go read the WOTLK box we never seen the &quot;aerial dogfights&quot;.<br />

This just falls in line with why GC is a terrible Dev and is a perfect example of why WoW has gone down the drain since he joined the team back in WOTLK. &quot;let me just say we have a feature coming that I'm going to give zero information on. The community will never speculate amiright?&quot;<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like the feature is either not done or they scrapped it. The entire &quot;Guess what it will be when the patch drops&quot; is a joke. That's a cop out if I ain't ever seen one.</div></div><hr />

If I'm raiding chances are my game sounds are going to be off as I find them distracting, if I'm entering a new zone for the first time like when a new expansion comes out or I'm doing some kind of lore quest I want to experience everything so game sounds and music are turned on and turned up!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only joking but the unannounced feature looked interesting, oh well.<br />
<br />
How can an unannounced feature look interesting when you know nothing about it? It's like people getting up in arms when they push Titan back, when nobody knows anything about it, but Titan looked interesting? Maybe the prospect of it?<br />
<br />
Blizz just simply needs to keep their yaps shut about everything. Given the level on rationality in the Warcraft community, you can't hint at anything without it becoming a required feature lest the fans go into meltdown mode over it when it's not able to be implemented. At this point, there's nothing they could put into WoW that hasn't already been done, unless they backtrack on their promises some more of not implementing certain things. <br />
<br />
When they say this kind of stuff, you just need to brush it off. I have a policy of &quot;I'll see about that&quot; with Blizzard, since they've stated so much crap in the past and then not followed through or completely reversed their previous statements. Everything that you want is &quot;something they really want to implement in a future patch/expansion&quot; but will probably never, ever see. Inside and outside of the game, they are masters of the carrot, 8 million people still around prove this.</div></div><hr />

Like seriously, how many QQs do these idiots have to waste on precious dev response time?<br />
<br />
There were maybe 20% of those tweets regarding dailies/content that even warranted an answer. Crapiness of the WoW community at full force, in under 140 characters of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesnt think the community is 90% morons,it KNOWS it,hell everybody here knows 90% of WoW Subscribers are morons who want everything for nothing and want to know all the secrets like they are owed it or some shit, to me they act like babies that have just been told they cant have that chocolate bar from the shop and then dragged out screaming &quot;I WANT MY CHOC CHOC WAHHHWAHHHH&quot;. <br />
<br />
If the new feature in 5.4 is to punch trolls and morons through your monitor,i will gladly donate 5 million pounds in subscriptions a week!</div></div><hr />

Personally, I think they have made the game a lot more friendly for people to catch up. I don't have time to grind out reps or anything like that, but I'm already around a 480* ilevel and only have been 90 on my warrior for a couple days. Between the world bosses, the isle of thunder dropping a lot of elder charms and the enhanced drop rates in Terrace and below make it easy to catch up gear wise.<br />

The only thing I still hate is it seems like everything ont he AH is so very expensive. I was never good at getting gold so I sit around 7k and it really blows trying to gem and enchant, leaves me broke.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, the problem is with the devs responding to them. It happens so much. A person on twitter makes a really stupid comment about dailies´... ie.. ´ I have to do dailies´ . The easy answer is no you don´t, there are 10 different ways to earn valor, there is no gear that has been decent for raiders from factions since 5.1.... there is absolutely no reason to run dailies if you don´t want to.<br />
<br />
The person making the stupid statement is NOT going to listen to any answer, so why reply. The devs reply, then the person changes the topic to something slightly different and complains again, the devs answer, the player changes again..<br />
<br />
THAT player is never going to be happy, you are never going to change their mind.. the ONLY thing the dev is doing is highlighting the original players crying and giving it space on sites like MMO-Champion. You can tell by the original comment the person wasn´t rational, DO NOT RESPOND.<br />

From their answers it would seem that the feature was needed to rush the next expansion out, thus cut from mop. <br />
<br />
But the original question still stands: What MoP feature will change the game as much as LFD/LFR?<br />
<br />
It won´t. they already said it will not change the game in a major way. They already said that most players will not be excited about it.<br />
<br />
It is scaling down to run old content at the right level and gear ilvl.</div></div><hr />

Just pick your favorite and call it that.How on earth is that anything other than a massive u-turn?<br />
<br />
Lets say you run an ice cream shop. Someone asks you, &quot;What's the flavor that's going to define this year?&quot; &quot;We haven't announced it yet.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then people go wild. &quot;I bet it's banana chocolate cream&quot; or &quot;I'm never coming back to your shop if it's not strawberry mango guava&quot; and there's even a dude screaming &quot;I demand shrimp ice cream, it must be shrimp ice cream.&quot; There's no way to please them all; even if you had infinite time, there are other people sitting around saying, &quot;If you stock shrimp ice cream I'm never coming back,&quot; so you can't make everyone happy.<br />
<br />
So instead of saying, &quot;Here's the grand reveal, it's banana chocolate cream,&quot; you just go ahead with your standard set of 3-4 flavors including that one and say, &quot;Whichever one you love the most, that's the big unannounced flavor.&quot; That's what GC is doing here.<br />
<br />
They're not cutting the feature. They're not saying it's smaller than expected. They're just trying to help you understand that it might not be the feature you were desperately hoping for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard has been at this game for long enough to know how the human mind works at least to some degree. It's not what you say but how you say it. Mysteriousness breeds curiosity, that's why horror stories are, to this day, still wildly popular. People want to know every little detail no matter how big or small if you say you've got some sort of &quot;unannounced feature&quot;. Blizzard should've known the community would blow it out of proportion, as they have done with every single announcement Blizzard has ever made. People do this with virtually any announcement, no matter what it's about.<br />
<br />
The problem is that Blizzard then go and blame the community for the hype. If Blizzard is too damn stupid to learn how the players minds work by now then that's not our fault.<br />
<br />
As for the players being too stupid and dull-minded to not cause hype? I think people forget that it was companies like Blizzard who have shaped players like this. World of Warcraft never used to be about butterflies and rainbows, it was about grinding your ass off for cheap thrills. It wasn't necessarily hard but it was tortuously tedious. Most video games made over 10 years ago were like this.<br />
<br />
The industry (gaming, that is) changed this by making games more accessible to casual gamers and part-time fans. They made games easier overall and less tedious. To say gamers are stupid because they want everything on a silver platter is ignorant. The industry has given players everything they've wanted for the past 10 years. The way gaming has evolved isn't always bad but it has made gamers lazy. That's partially our fault for not moaning about it in greater numbers before and partially the industry's fault for capitalizing on our own inner desire to be lazy.<br />
