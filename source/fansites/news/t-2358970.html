Kul Tiras Continent<br />
Kul Tiras (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Kul_Tiras) was founded 3,000 years ago when a group of Gilneans (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gilneas_(kingdom)) left the empire to explore the Great Sea (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Great_Sea). They came upon a mountainous region rich in resources and decided to settle in. Over the course of the next 2,500 years they built one of the most powerful navies on Azeroth. The Alliance is very interested in bringing this navy into their ranks. Kul Tiras is ruled by four houses that are in trouble.<br />

Kul Tiras Region - Tiragarde Sound<br />
Tiragarde Sound (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Tiragarde_Sound) sits on an inland in the middle of the continent and connects the zones. It contains the capital of Kul Tiras, Boralus, which is the Alliance main hub for the expansion. Katherine Proudmoore (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Katherine_Proudmoore), Jaina’s mother, is in charge. Kul Tirans hunt sea monsters and so are much heartier than normal humans. The main problem in Tiragarde Sound is pirates and their stronghold, Freehold (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Freehold), which is a dungeon in the expansion. <br />

<br />
Kul Tiras Region - Drustvar<br />
Drustvar (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Drustvar) is a forested mountainous region located in the southwest of Kul Tiras. It is governed by House Wavecrest, but in recent months they have been suspiciously absent from public affairs. In their absence, arms and sausages have stopped being supplied to Boralus (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Boralus). Witchcraft and death magic are heavily prominent as the land is cursed.<br />

<br />
Kul Tiras Region - Stormsong Valley<br />
Stormsong Valley (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Stormsong_Valley) is located in the north of Kul Tiras and is lush, green and beautiful. House Stormsong is in charge and the people here are extremely devoted to the sea, providing ships for Kul Tiras. Sea Priests must bless each vessel that sails out of Stormsong Valley. Ship building operations have stopped as ancient dark forces are invading from the sea. Quilboars (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Quilboar) are also a huge problem. <br />

Zandalar Continent<br />
The Zandalari Empire (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Empire_of_Zul) formed 16,000 years ago. The continent of Zandalar was once a landlocked mountain but the sundering changed that. The empire sank into the sea, but the trolls adapted to island life and built a navy that rivals, if not surpasses, Kul Tiras. The Horde wants to add this navy to its cause.<br />

Zandalar Region - Zuldazar<br />
Zuldazar (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Zuldazar) is the capital of the Zandalari Empire and is located in the southern part of the island. It is also the only safe haven on the continent. The Horde use this capital as a hub for the expansion. King Rastakhan (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/69915-king-rastakhan) and his daughter, Princess Talanji, rule over this empire. The Horde must investigate an internal uprising within Zuldazar while also fending off blood trolls from the north.<br />

Zandalar Region - Nazmir<br />
Nazmir (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Nazmir) was once a lush forest but has since become a festering swampland since Deathwing shook the earth. Blood trolls thrive here. To defeat these trolls, the Horde must enlist the help of the Loa, powerful troll gods. The Loa of Death Bwonsamdi (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/40182-bwonsamdi) and Krawgwa the Frog Loa play important roles in the story. Nazmir also contains a Titan facility that holds the key to destroying all life on Azeroth.<br />

<br />
Zandalar Region - Vol'dun<br />
To the northwest lies the desert of Vol'dun (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Vol%27dun). It used to be a thriving jungle until the Aqir (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Aqir) destroyed it. Zandalar send their criminals to this desert to die, however, some survive to cause problems. A native race of fox people called the Vulpera (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Vulpera) make their home in this desert as well. They will need help against the Sethrak (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Sethrak), sentient snake people, who also cause trouble.<br />

I recommend you to get an M2 SSD. Mine runs a mind boggling 2,5 GB/sec read speed, and it fixed literally every single lag problem I had that wasn't connected to the internet. Dalaran loads in around 10-20 seconds, and the game no longer tries to crash your PC when you attempt to join a 40-man group in the middle of a world boss kill. Of course, those drives are still really expensive, but I find the time you save in load times more than makes up for it.</div></div><hr />

The original human Kingdom Arathor expanded after the troll wars and those happened 2.800 before the opening of the dark portal officially it began expanding 2700 years ago so at that time Gilneas might have come to be, but since Kul'tiras is now an offshoot of Gilneas it should be even younger ca 2.500 years ago or so.<br />
<br />
This is how the human kingdom looked 2.800 years ago<br />

Most of players cannot use m2 ssd because they motherboards are too old for that standard. And m2 ssd cost like good cpu.</div></div><hr />

I hope things turn out different but based on what I see I'm worried. Blizzard hasn't done a good job of Horde vs Alliance themes in past expansions due to PvE being more focused on than PvP (Thus Warfronts not even being real PvP...) which completely defeats the purpose of a &quot;faction war&quot;.<br />

I know the main villain of the expansion is said to be Azshara and that has a ton of potential but based on what we have seen so far that's not anywhere near launch.</div></div><hr />

Samsung 960 Evo NVMe M.2 250GB thats the best -not expensive- with 3200 speed read. And a good cpu costs more than this. For us in Greece costs 126 euro</div></div><hr />

Not sure if they ain't a little bit tooooooooo cute(which means they would end up in the alliance anyway). They somehow look like they are right from some Zelda universe...and I think Blizz didn't have much luck with the cute panda models either.<br />

I want those fat guy guy models as player models. About time for more physical diversity. End the clone wars... ;-)</div></div><hr />

Yay, some forest areas, a grassy area, a desert, some places with snow, troll areas; while yes, it all looks very nice and will be fun to see it at first since it's something new...it's not something to be excited about when there is 20 other places like that ingame.

Yes, because Legion areas are so cool.. (sarcasm)<br />
<br />
Azshara is the final boss in the 2nd raid.<br />
<br />
They never said Warfronts are PvP. So I don't understand what your 'real pvp' is.<br />
<br />
Old gods &gt; Burning Legion (at least in my view)<br />

Second place for me would be Nazmir/Zuldazar, dinosaurs and open spaces. I LOVE a nice open zone. Like Mulgore was, starting there was a wonderful experience and I would love them to replicate that feel, then throw some giant dinosaurs in the distance and it will be so cool ^_^</div></div><hr />

Second place for me would be Nazmir/Zuldazar, dinosaurs and open spaces. I LOVE a nice open zone. Like Mulgore was, starting there was a wonderful experience and I would love them to replicate that feel, then throw some giant dinosaurs in the distance and it will be so cool ^_^<br />
<br />
Pretty sure all 3 zones are 110-120. The endgame ones are technically the other continent for the respective faction. So for example 120 Horde go to Kul Tiras and 120 Alliance go to Zandalar.</div></div><hr />

Ganking is not fighting. After 14 years Blizzard finally came to this realization and removed this aspect of the game.<br />
I sincerely hope gankers will be true to their word and unsub from the game.</div></div><hr />

Yeah because getting ganked in HFP on most servers by a 110 as a 60 is &quot;fighting&quot;.<br />

Zuldazar grabs my attention the most, finally we’ll get a Horde exclusive capital rather than a ‘neutral’ city or a basic bitch hub. Swamps and deserts in general can either be my favourite or most hated zones in the game depending on how they’re designed.<br />

They never said Warfronts are PvP. So I don't understand what your 'real pvp' is.<br />

Old gods &gt; Burning Legion (at least in my view)<br />

Your comment has no bases at all, What you said is totally the opposite of what was said at blizzcon. Apart from your sones opinion.<br />
<br />
The Broken Islands in Legion weren't super exciting either but it at least made sense since that's where the Tomb of Sargeras is.<br />

I know Warfronts aren't PvP, that was my entire point. Maybe read more closely next time you decide to comment on something.</div></div><hr />

No, not even WoD was a filler expansion. It was a crap expansion, poorly executed and lacking and there's no excuse for that such as &quot;Oh they were treating it as filler to give us Legion!&quot;, especially when they had a bigger crew than ever working for them during that time..

I feel the same. WoD was weakest expac only because low quantity, not quality. All core elements - dungeons, raids, zones were amazing. It just lacked systems to keep this relevant, so they abandoned the ship and scraped any serious patch support (which was obviously NOT cool). <br />
<br />
Draenor with World Quest and Mythic+ would be entirely different experience. And raiding was already great, for more hardcore people even better that it's today (again, except quantity - WoD had only 2 months of Highmaul and 2 raid tiers, Legion has de facto 4 tiers lasting 4-5 months each).</div></div><hr />

First time we are getting a proper desert zone since Cata and Desert is right up there for me. Along with Jungle, Underwater and Snow.<br />

Gorgrond was deserty in some areas, and technically Frostfire is a desert too.<br />

I would reaaaaally like to see the artwotk concepts for building textures and general feeling of the expansion, so far nothing seems very specific, not at least like Legion where the early artworks already gave us a clear idea of the look and feel of the expansion, lots of Felslate stones, cursed stones and fel-soul infused walls.<br />

Map size doesn't equal in game world size. Pandaria for example is bigger than the Cata zones. Pandaria is only about 20% smaller than Northrend. Broken isles with shore and Argus are actually bigger than Pandaria. Nothing is getting smaller Northrend being the exception.</div></div><hr />

Apart from voidlords is there anyone more powerful than us? we just bested the legion while our respective sides bickered with each other over the broken shore fiasco having them push us to fight each other is bigger other than having us fight the voidlords.

I am replying to him on there is no big &quot;baddie&quot; in BFA and that at least from what we know right now voidlords are the strongest out there we just took out the no.2 Blizzard have yet to add any other big baddie other than the Legion and Sergeras both which we have dealt with already hell we managed to kill a titan. tbh the way things happen atm in WoW I feel bad for the villains they just never have a chance the second we show up seeing as we see both horde and alliance struggle but when we are there we simply win win hell Blizzard could kill off every single lore character we got atm and in terms on how we are going to win its easy we will win the battles like we have done in legion with little to no help apart from fighting Argus in which the Pantheon aided us.</div></div><hr />

would be interesting to lose some fight in a meaninfull way and have some lasting consequences,legion started that way but it was short and you didnt rly feel the loss across the expansion</div></div><hr />

<br />
To quote myself from page one<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The original human Kingdom Arathor expanded after the troll wars and those happened 2.800 before the opening of the dark portal officially it began expanding 2700 years ago so at that time Gilneas might have come to be, but since Kul'tiras is now an offshoot of Gilneas it should be even younger ca 2.500 years ago or so.<br />
<br />
This is how the human kingdom looked 2.800 years ago<br />

plz no, what blizzard didnt since MoP is making zone feel real, and not big and open like BC/WotLK just to compensate for a flying mount. <br />
<br />
MOP WOD AND LEGION zones feel alive and when you flying trow it on quest you can feel that the zone feel real and not just a big open space with nothing.<br />

<br />
the whole Alliance vs horde on the next expansion is to fracture the alliance we form to defeat the Legion, like u said as a unit front we defeat Sargeras (well we didnt we just imprison him) and kill a weak Titan (he wasnt awake like the others, plus he was drain after been use by sargeras)<br />
<br />
<br />
Next expansion we will probably phase Azhara and the last old god, and we going to be introduce about the void, there was a panel on blizzcon where they speak about going deep on the fight between the Light and the Void. And we got a taste of this on Alduin comic when he was old and going to phase the last battle vs the void. <br />
<br />
U probably can like it or no, but for the look of it they already have a general plan for the story. And for the look of it Wow still have 2 more expansion to go.</div></div><hr />

It all started with that talentless hack Christie I-Can't-Write-To-Save-My-Own-Life Golden. Those ladies are just devs right? They have no say in what happens with the lore and that's where WoW's taken it's biggest hits.<br />
<br />
Edit: as for the screens, I gotta say, Kul Tiras is just the drabbest thing ever and really doesn't inspire much confidence that it'll be much fun unless it has a really engaging storyline.</div></div><hr />

Mine runs a mind boggling 2,5 GB/sec read speed, and it fixed literally every single lag problem I had that wasn't connected to the internet. Dalaran loads in around 10-20 seconds, and the game no longer tries to crash your PC when you attempt to join a 40-man group in the middle of a world boss kill. Of course, those drives are still really expensive, but I find the time you save in load times more than makes up for it.<br />
<br />
You must be kidding...:D WoW requirements a M.2 SSD?:D Now that is an extremely poor coding...and you just prove that :D<br />
Not like I have any trust in Blizz....BM hunter second pet (Hati) still bugged, TW instances bugged as fuck, Dalaran and the ship on Argus bugged as fuck (sometimes when i teleporting any of these, just falling through the floor, then reappearing on the surface), bosses on Argus bugged as fuck since ages....</div></div><hr />
