Smoothest Launch Ever!<br />
Shout out to our amazing server engineers (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/770533667131133952) and the other folks who have helped make this launch a success! A lot of them worked tirelessly through long and stressful nights to make sure this went smooth. They typically live in the background of our day-to-day activities here, but I've never seen such an awesome launch since I started playing WoW, so the praise is deserved!<br />
<br />
Another shout out to all the testers who have tirelessly supplied their feedback and notes on bugs, issues, and crashes over the course of Alpha and Beta - you guys helped create this experience as well, and we couldn't have done it without you.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has amazing teams, and it's been awesome seeing us all come together to pull this off. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/756707-smoothest-launch-ever/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748896027?page=1#8))<br />

Cenarion Circle Reputation and Artifact Quests<br />
I can't do the Druid artifact quests because I'm hostile with the Cenarion Circle. Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem won't speak to me. Can you guys turn him into a neutral faction NPC please? I know this is karma for the hours spent murdering Moonglade Guards but this is literally barring me entry from WoW Legion. I'm pretty sad right now. <br />
This issue has been hotfixed. <br />
<br />
Cenarion Circle has decided to make peace with everyone. <br />
<br />
You should now all be able to get the quest.<br />
<br />
If you find any remaining issues related to this issue please let us know.<br />

Amazon Collector's Edition Delay<br />
Just got word from Amazon (today, release day, on the day I was supposed to take delivery) that my Collector's Edition will not arrive until sometime between the end of September and the end of October.<br />
We have been investigating this and learned that there was a shipping issue which impacted some players who pre-ordered their CE from select retailers. We’re currently working with these retailers to address this issue and make sure these players get their copy of the CE as quickly as possible. We hope that this will be resolved shortly for you and any others affected.

Personally MoP was fairly smooth. WoD had to deal with an unexpected surge of 3 million players. The playerbase effectively DDoS the severs themselves and was pointed as part of the problem by Blues.<br />
<br />
While nice to see a somewhat smooth launch, one would hope so after devs upfront spent a lot of work on game oriented systems for Legion to deal with congestion including breaking up populated areas in even smaller instances which has the benefit of improving client side performance as well. Previous expansions mainly focused on the back end. For that I am glad the systems are working.</div></div><hr />

Ya, they tried that version. Remember the Spyglass? I'd much rather have a server be overly-aggressive about sharding to the point of zones feeling slightly underpopulated, than have it under-aggressive about sharding to the point of lag and crashes, or even just fighting hordes of idiots for the quest spawns like it's the last $40 tablet on black friday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i started from Azsuna because it felt most &quot;boring&quot; one so i would do it first. Definitely not crowded zone, usually 2-3 other players in the same area. Don't know if it's the sharding or people just chose different starting zones. But i don't mind, actually it's better this way IMO. I don't like other people &quot;messing&quot; with my questing.</div></div><hr />

You do not seem to know what a DDOS attack is:confused: Maybe read up on such a topic before you make any comments: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack<br />

DDOS is coming from outside Blizzards network and is NOT Blizzards fault.<br />

Draenor-EU had 30 minute queue and is locked, so I have no idea what you are on about. I love the sharding btw, seeing just a couple of people around makes me feel more important, no interfering with my quests and it still gives the feeling of not being alone.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea what the numbers are but the amount of people waiting to talk to khadgar for the launch was about... 1/10th of what it was last expac on my server. Which may mean absolutely nothing, I have no idea how the servers work now with crz and such.</div></div><hr />

Me and a bunch of friends took azhuna first. and we are happy we did. on our server there was quite a few but not so many that it was impossible to get kills. also simply love the look of the zones and the questline. Lets just say there are no more quest bonus objective rares or treasure læeft on that zone before i moved to high mountain.</div></div><hr />

So thats why so many quests are bugged or you cant see them on the map/minimap?<br />
The game really feel rushed, these small things should have been dealt with during the beta, no way they would have missed these things.<br />

Think they overdid it on this shard tech, it is so empty even on full realms</div></div><hr />

A large part of it is because there aren't any huge bottlenecks anymore, due to the scaling tech allowing people to spread out and not be in the same zone at the same levels and the fact that not everyone has the same class hall. The only potential bottleneck I heard of was from a guildmate who went to Highmountain first, and got stuck for a bit in the Huln Azshara quest because of how many people were there killing the demons too fast. But they fixed that in these hotfixes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This comment makes me wonder how many launch days you've played through and what kind of server populations you were dealing with. I played on a high pop server through Cata, MoP, WoD and now Legion. Cata and MoP both for me typically included anywhere from a 30 min to sometimes 2+ hour que just to get logged into the game to even play, especially during the first week. A short que lingered around for another couple of weeks after that.<br />
<br />
Also, WoD launch was an extremely painful launch. I never even got logged in the first 3 days because of the problems. On all 3 days I sat in a que and never even got remotely close to being able to log in. One day I even started the log in process before going to work my 6 hour shift (and I was only 10 mins from where I worked), to come home and being only half way through the que. Then, when I finally did get logged in, there were bugs, massive lag, and all sorts of other problems for several more days before things started to smooth out and get better.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if your system was lagging out because of the &quot;1k players standing in the same room&quot; how do you even manage to visit capital cities without experiencing severe lag? There were some lag bubbles, but it's not for the reason you are complaining out, and frankly, they were short lived and not really all that bad.</div></div><hr />

I personally HATED having to waste time on killing mobs because so many other people was killing them. just doing a quest at beginning of BC was terrible. So for me all in all i am happy with the changes. I know some of you may not like it but even out questing i seen the fair share of people. I am the type of person that hates leveling so i want to get it done asap lol. it is just boring to me sorry i aint into lore that much. <br />
<br />
The bar at the top i love when i go to my class hall. tells me so much info. i hated going into my garrison and having to pull up my character profile to see how much stuff i had. I know some will like not having it just for me i wont be. <br />
<br />
But good job on the launch, I come from a low pop server anyhow so seeing a bunch of people in dalaran was kinda refreshing as a city should have alot of people in it imo.<br />
<br />
On that note not all of us will agree. That is what makes us human. Sorry for the people that didnt like how they did it. I guess you like to have to compete to kill mobs to get quests taken care of.</div></div><hr />

If you're queueing as DPS, that's going to happen when a bunch of people return to the game and the vast majority of them are DPS. My healer is only in queue for less than five minutes. My tank for less than that.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm was smooth, even MoP was. The worst of all was WoD because of the huge garrison bottleneck that they didn't care until launch (and not thinking that all those players would really come back to WoW, growing the playerbase from 4-6M to 10M+ again).<br />

Holy shit it doesn't matter what you say, or how good you do, some kid on the internet is always going to have something to say to the contrary. In Cata we were stuck in the underwater zone for 7 hours picking up an item on the ground with a ridiculously long respawn time. In MOP we were stuck at the first zone 3 quests in for 17 hours. How the fuck is this not better than those two. I played for 22 hours straight without a disconnect or a single ounce of lag. Be positive for once in your life.</div></div><hr />

According to the engineering panel at Blizzcon, it was actually due to the server blades accidentally getting mixed up during a previous maintenance. They had retrofitted a bunch of blades with double the RAM to accommodate garrisons, but the server infrastructure for WoW is sort of archaic and requires specific blades to be booted in a certain order. After performing a maintenance, some of the upgraded blades got put in the wrong part of the sequence, causing some of the instance servers to not have enough RAM to handle all the garrison instances getting spawned.<br />
<br />
The problem was just amplified by the bottleneck that funneled all players into that quest and prevented progress without completing it.<br />

<br />
Btw there is NO WAY to compare this expansion to WoD. I was disappointed in WoD from the second it was announced, because I knew that 2+ years of full &quot;lokthar ogar blood and thunder and orc sweat&quot; wasn't gonna do much for me thematically. <br />
<br />
Also when WoD launch came around, there had already been so many awful disappointments -- garrisons with close to zero customization and not even being movable, no Karabor, no Shattrath, &quot;Trashcan hubs&quot; instead, no flying (with no guarantee that it would ever be possible in WoD areas), no Tanaan, no Faralohn ... and I'm probably still forgetting something.<br />
<br />
Compare with Legion announcement and launch. Zero disappointments so far, no let down expectations or going back on promises. <br />
<br />
If anything, Legion might be in danger of going like Cata, with a great launch and then disappointing patches. We'll have to see that. But it's already miles better than WoD ever was.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you see &quot;tons of people&quot; but that's 100% flat wrong from my experiences. The only place I see considerable numbers of people is Dalaran and Class Halls, and by &quot;considerable&quot; I mean in the neighborhood of maybe 20.<br />
<br />
I chose Azsuna as my starting area and I hardly see anyone, and I've been playing at 8-10pm server time.<br />
<br />
Last night I decided to take a break from questing and just go roam the zones herbing and mining and looking at scenery and it VERY VERY much feels like a single-player game. I traveled from Azsuna to Highmountain to Stormheim by ground mount, and I raised both my herbalism and mining to about 750. During that whole time I saw probably a total of six other players. <br />

It's the sharding. I'm sure of it. There is a quest in highmountain where you play in a flashback and it didn't seem to have the same sharding, it was immersion breaking because everyone was the same character but there was a massive amount of people there. I probably have 50 people on my screen at any given point and I could see swarms of people around each NPC in the quest chain.</div></div><hr />

I am on a pretty dead realm right now and this is my experience too, though honestly I love it. I feel it's incredibly disturbing to the gaming experience if there's a lot of other players around, particularly since WoW has tried to invoke the You're Our Sole, Amazing, MVP Hero feeling for quite some time now. It's pretty odd to see top tier NPCs like Khadgar speak to a million players at the same time or, in general, have a millon players around at the same time (every other launch this far, including WoD). That's also why I hate doing the Lorespeaker World quests and the quest in Highmountain where you play part of the past - there's a gazillion players there and it's beyond silly.<br />
<br />
I do see players, but more like I would expect on a regular day, not launch day, and perhaps a bit more than what a regular day looks like on this dead realm of mine (I'm new to this realm, so I can't say). Just enough players so I don't feel alone - and definitely not so many that I feel brutally torn from the fantasy of playing WoW.</div></div><hr />

You do not seem to know what a DDOS attack is:confused: Maybe read up on such a topic before you make any comments: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack<br />
<br />
DDOS is coming from outside Blizzards network and is NOT Blizzards fault.<br />
Probably some script-kiddies who like to disrupt the servers now that Legion has launched...:mad::(<br />

Definitely one of the most smoothest launches of a new exp. in WoW History. I am a Vanilla player and had no issues on the Realms I play on (except that Silvermoon was full:rolleyes: ).<br />
As I work in IT I know what goes on on the back-end of a large infrastructure like this and I must say that Blizzards Engineers did an incredible job! KUDOS for them:D<br />
<br />
Very nice of you to link me something that I have to deal with in my BLOODY DAY JOB, but good on you... 10/10 effort.<br />
I'm just pointing sarcastically how funny thing always go wrong whenever people start patting themselves on the back, maybe... understand sarcasm before trying to get on an intellectual high horse??</div></div><hr />
