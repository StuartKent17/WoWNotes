2.4 Testing soon ?<br />
European PTR forums have been cleaned yesterday and most of the US community managers have been very quiet, I wouldn't be surprised if we had some decent 2.4 details released today, or even the PTR itself.<br />
To keep this forum relevant to the current or upcoming version on the PTRs, all old threads have been removed. This will be done soon after each patch test cycle is completed and the patch is applied to the regular realms.<br />
<br />
Informational sticky threads will be reposted after each forum wipe, and as new information about the current or upcoming patch becomes available it will be added in this forum. <br />
<br />
(Note : Thundgot also posted a small post about the Blizzard Feedback Tool (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=2405445944&amp;sid=1) on PTRs)<br />
And hopefully it will be the last time I link : <br />
The good old 2.4 compilation post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=3199.0).<br />

You get to keep your Mojo !<br />
If you managed to get a Mojo by /kissing the troll next to Zul'aman before the &quot;bug&quot; was fixed yesterday, you shouldn't be worried about seeing it disappear.<br />
Mojo wasn't intended to be obtained for a kiss outside of Zul'Aman. You will need to get a hex stick and try your luck on the frogs inside Zul'Aman.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, those who have managed to acquire Mojo will be able to keep him. Yes, you get to keep your Mojo. <br />
<br />

US Realms - Extended maintenance<br />
US Realms are getting an extended maintenance today, probably because of the crashes affecting most of the realms during the weekend.<br />
We will be performing extended maintenance for all realms on Tuesday, January 29. The downtime will begin at 3:00 AM PST and end at approximately 11:00 AM PST.<br />

<br />
Bugs are not so easy to solve, you change one thing on the other side of a program and it can have dire repercussions in another area altogether, its part of programming, I have a personal RPG engine I coded and I changed one little line of code in the fighting system for the game and it caused a duplication/item disappearing bug in the inventory system for heaven's sake, took me 3 months to find out how to fix it and its still not completely fixed =p<br />
<br />
Some bugs are just elusive, no matter how many people you have working on them you can't always find what caused them, it just increases your chances to find what did it.</div></div><hr />

Can only say LOL ;D<br />
<br />
I am still wondering about ER, I mean it is freaking 41 point talent. Yes 95% warriors does not use it but still it would be nice to post blue topic on warrior forum explaining what is bugged.<br />
<br />
Because at the moment we can suspect two things:<br />
1) It gives less rage that expected - so with fix maybe it would be worth it after all?<br />
2) It gives more rage than expected - then I could not believe it, I mean this talent scream for buff already (with Imp. MS).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
i believe this bug is more recent. i plan on testing 41/17/3 later today to see how much rage it generates after all, only thing is blizz needs to move weapon mastery back to arms tree, such a bad idea to switch it with imp intercept, they should have swapped it with blood fury :/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Efedorus</div><div class="date">2008-01-29, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so yeah then the mojo wasnt intended heh.. &quot;feeling' a little froggy&quot; how the heck they made a mistake to put that on a troll giving free pets just with /kiss :o. that's just a &quot;very&quot; well made mistake</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shadowclaimer</div><div class="date">2008-01-29, 07:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Swapped up ID's, every NPC in the game has an ID applied to them (The URL Link on Thottbot/Wowhead)<br />
<br />
Every quest/script also has an ID on it, so let's say its go kill 10 (ID Number of NPC), etc. so when Blizzard made the two NPCs they might have made them one after the other (Original Mojo Giver may be 21422 and the troll outside 21423) some coder may have had a simple mixup and given the script in 2.3 the wrong ID, or maybe they changed the IDs for organization reasons, he could've given them both the same ID (that would cause loads of fun), theres just a million possible things that could've gone wrong =p</div></div><hr />

This make little sense too as rend is arms skill and deep wounds are also in tier2 arms. Well arms and fury are quite a mess at the moment, they better reorganize them in wotlk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Red Jack Flint, the quest giver, tells you that Fiona can be found in Theramore, which until 2.3 she was. But, with 2.3 they moved her to Auberdine in Darkshore but they didn't update the quest details.</div></div><hr />
