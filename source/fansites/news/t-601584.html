The Armory Tools (http://armory.mmo-champion.com/ (http://armory.mmo-champion.com/)) were based on an open source script from Antiarc, who first published it on http://wow.tachyonsix.com/armory/ (http://wow.tachyonsix.com/armory/). <br />

Sadly, I didn't have the time (and the knowledge) to update it, and I had a few bugs on the site that I couldn't really fix. I thought it might be a good idea to ask Antiarc if he would like to be hosted on mmo-champion.com. <br />
<br />
The main Armory Tools (http://armory.mmo-champion.com/) site is now hosted on the site and run independently by Antiarc. It should be more up to date than what I had on the site earlier. (And before someone ask in comments, yes the gold sellers ads are removed and you can report them, posting in comments is fine)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The armory tools site is hosted on the same domain as this site yet is blocked for me.<br />
<br />
Was rather hoping that wouldn't happen :-\</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excuse my ignorance,<br />
<br />
https is the same as http but gets around web blockers? Or was it a typo like BYOBB?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Https is indeed a secure(r) version of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (http), since Im a lazy ass I cited a source under here to explain (in short) how https works. First of I should say that https is secure through certificates who verify who you are and who the server is:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Secure Socket Layer protocol was created by Netscape to ensure secure transactions between web servers and browsers. The protocol uses a third party, a Certificate Authority (CA), to identify one end or both end of the transactions. This is in short how it works.<br />
<br />
1. A browser requests a secure page (usually https://).<br />
2. The web server sends its public key with its certificate.<br />
3. The browser checks that the certificate was issued by a trusted party (usually a trusted root CA), that the certificate is still valid and that the certificate is related to the site contacted.<br />
4. The browser then uses the public key, to encrypt a random symmetric encryption key and sends it to the server with the encrypted URL required as well as other encrypted http data.<br />
5. The web server decrypts the symmetric encryption key using its private key and uses the symmetric key to decrypt the URL and http data.<br />
6. The web server sends back the requested html document and http data encrypted with the symmetric key.<br />
7. The browser decrypts the http data and html document using the symmetric key and displays the information.<br />
<br />

<br />
While SSL is secure one should not completly rely on it to keep you safe, it has failed in the past (you can probably find some information on google about this).<br />
<br />
In the case of the armory security is not really an issue though, I am yearning for an https version of it mostly since Websense has shown some weakness regarding the secure socket layer allowing people to access otherwise blocked content (doesn't allways work 100% Websense have been able to block a few proxys using https to my knowledge).<br />
<br />
Anyways, sorry for explaining stuff some of you might not have wanted to know, but some of you might have wanted to know more about it. <br />
Good luck and have fun all of you!<br />
<br />
Sincerely<br />

<br />
EDIT: Websense haven't been able to fully block SSL traffic, rather it have blocked a whole domain (ftp:// etc) so the https version is rendered useless aswell since there is no access to the site at all.</div></div><hr />
