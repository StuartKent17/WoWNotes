Catching Up to 5.3<br />
There’s a ton of content worth experiencing in Mists of Pandaria—but if you’re leveling alts or just looking to get to the highest gear levels to see the newest content, the “best” route is not always clear. We get a lot of questions on what to focus on, so hopefully this article can provide some helpful guidance.<br />
<br />
Back in the Day<br />
In the initial months after Mists of Pandaria launched, the primary method to gear up a new level 90 was to run Scenarios and Heroic dungeons, and then do daily quests (beginning with Golden Lotus (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-plus-faction=1269&amp;filter-daily=1) and Klaxxi (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-plus-faction=1337&amp;filter-daily=1), and then progressing to Shado-Pan (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-plus-faction=1270&amp;filter-daily=1) and August Celestials (http://www.wowdb.com/quests?filter-plus-faction=1341&amp;filter-daily=1)) to earn reputation to unlock the vendors that sold higher-level epics. Along the way, players would qualify for the Raid Finder version of Mogu’shan Vaults, and then eventually the Raid Finder versions of Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Spring, supplementing the gear they unlocked and purchased with Valor Points.<br />
<br />
While all of that content, along with the original reputation vendors and associated progression, remains in the game, patch 5.2 introduced several new, more efficient ways to get a fresh level 90 caught up and ready to jump right into the Throne of Thunder raid.<br />
<br />
Get to ‘da Island!<br />
The core of the current gearing system revolves around the new Isle of Thunder, and the vastly accelerated rate at which Elder Charms of Good Fortune (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/697-elder-charm-of-good-fortune) can be obtained on the Isle. Elder Charms are used for bonus rolls when defeating raid bosses from the expansion’s first set of raids—Mogu’shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, Terrace of Endless Spring—as well as Mists of Pandaria’s original world bosses, Sha of Anger (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/60491-sha-of-anger) and Galleon (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/62346-galleon). By obtaining Elder Charms, defeating bosses, and using bonus rolls, you’ll receive more chances to acquire upgrades, helping you gear up at a faster pace.<br />
<br />
The Isle of Thunder also offers other ways to acquire Elder Charms. By defeating rare-spawn enemies (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs?filter-zone=6507&amp;filter-classification=20) on the Isle of Thunder, looting a Trove of the Thunder King (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/218593-trove-of-the-thunder-king), or defeating common enemies, players can receive a http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/94222.jpg Key to the Palace of Lei Shen (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94222-key-to-the-palace-of-lei-shen) (one per week, with a small chance at extras from the coffers (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94222-key-to-the-palace-of-lei-shen#related:contained-in-item) awarded at the conclusion of daily quest arcs). Players can take the key to Taoshi (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/70316-taoshi) in the Shado-Pan encampment located in the swamp at the center of the Isle for a chance to do a Treasure Room run. In these runs, players have 5 minutes to open as many chests as possible and make it as far as they can through a dangerous, trap-laden vault. These runs are not only a ton of fun, but can be extremely lucrative in providing gold and Elder Charms. Foregoing a race to the finish line and instead systematically opening every chest you can get your hands on will likely yield a significant number of Elder Charms—it’s not uncommon to emerge from a single run with over a dozen. Additional Elder Charms can be obtained by using Incantations (http://www.wowdb.com/items/misc/other?filter-search=Incantation) that also drop from creatures on the Isle and taking them to the graveyard in the mogu ruins on the west side of the Isle.<br />
<br />
In 5.2, we significantly increased drop rates (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3166-Patch-5-2-and-Raid-Finder-Satchels-5-2-Hotfixes-ToT-Progression-Blue-Tweets-Comic) in the Raid Finder versions of Mogu’shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, and Terrace of Endless Spring, so it’s quite possible to walk into the Raid Finder and have enough Elder Charms to use a bonus roll on every boss you kill (with greatly increased drop chances) for a tremendous loot yield. You can also run Raid Finder more than once per week if you have more Elder Charms. You won’t receive normal drops from the boss, but your bonus rolls will have a chance of rewarding an item.<br />
<br />
Misc. Stuff We Couldn’t Think of a Title For<br />
If you’re into PvP, recent changes have made PvE gear pretty decent in PvP, and vice-versa. Outside of sockets and set bonuses, you can get a bunch of Honor (or Justice Points, and covert them to Honor at the Justice Trade Good vendors in Orgrimmar and Stormwind) and buy Item Level (ilvl) 476 PvP gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=476&amp;filter-ilvl-max=476&amp;filter-pvp-only=y) to help fill in any gaps and help you get into the higher rungs of PvE content.<br />
<br />
Like Sha of Anger, the world boss Galleon now respawns much more frequently. The world boss Nalak (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/69099-nalak) is also now accessible on the Isle of Thunder, and the Shado-Pan Assault vendor is selling a neckpiece (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor/necklaces?filter-patch=16408&amp;filter-source=4096) for Valor Points with no additional reputation requirements. In addition, the Isle of Thunder factions sell an ilvl 476 belt (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-patch=16408&amp;filter-ilvl-min=476&amp;filter-ilvl-max=476&amp;filter-slot=64) for gold at Honored reputation, which makes doing their dailies pretty enticing.<br />
<br />
What the Future Holds<br />
In Patch 5.3: Escalation, you’ll head to the Barrens and participate in an uprising (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3213-Battle-of-Razor-Hill-Final-ToT-LFR-Wing-April-11-PTR-Notes-Update-Blue-Tweets-Art) that will lead to the ultimate challenges in 5.4, and a variety of patch 5.3 content will award ilvl 476 to ilvl 489 items (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=16758&amp;filter-ilvl-min=476&amp;filter-ilvl-max=489) for participating in and completing quests. It’s important to note that the 5.3 world event will only be available for a limited time, as the story continues in 5.4. In addition, the XP required to level from 85 to 90 is being reduced by 33% in patch 5.3. If you’re looking to level and gear up alts, patch 5.3 may be a good time to do so with these additional options.<br />
<br />
Between all of these sources, an adventurous player should be should be able to walk right into the Raid Finder Throne of Thunder within a week or two of hitting level 90, even without touching any of the mainland reputations.<br />
<br />
Content ilvl Requirements<br />
<br />
ilvl 440 required for Heroic dungeons<br />
ilvl 460 required for Mogu’shan Vaults<br />
ilvl 470 required for Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Spring<br />
ilvl 480 required for Throne of Thunder<br />
<br />
<br />
Gearing for Throne of Thunder<br />
<br />
XP required to level from 85-90 reduced by 33% in patch 5.3<br />
ilvl 440 required for Heroic dungeons. Quest rewards from Townlong Steppes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/pandaria/townlong-steppes) as well as Dread Wastes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/pandaria/dread-wastes) will bring you up to 440. It may be worthwhile to begin these zones earlier in the leveling process<br />
At 90 head to the Isle of Thunder and progress through the quests each day and hunt for a http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/94222.jpg Key to the Palace of Lei Shen (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/94222-key-to-the-palace-of-lei-shen) each week. The portal to the Isle can be found at the Shado-Pan Garrison in western Townlong Steppes<br />
The Arena of Annihilation scenario has a mini-quest inside (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/31207-the-arena-of-annihilation) that rewards an ilvl 450 weapon<br />
Key to the Palace of Lei Shen looted once per week from rare spawns, Trove of Thunder King (http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/218593-trove-of-the-thunder-king) chests, or by defeating common enemies on the Isle of Thunder<br />
<br />
There’s a small chance for Throne of Thunder LFR gear (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-green-text=4&amp;filter-patch=16408) to come from the chests (http://ptr.wowdb.com/objects/218949-lei-shens-burial-trove#related:contains-item) after you’ve completed your run<br />
Loot run provides Elder Charms of Good Fortune<br />
Elder Charms provide bonus rolls when defeating bosses in Mogu’shan Vaults, Heart of Fear, Terrace of Endless Spring, as well as the 5.0 world bosses Sha of Anger and Galleon<br />
You can run LFR more than once per week if you have more Elder Charms. You won’t receive normal drops from the boss but your bonus rolls still do have a chance of rewarding an item<br />
<br />
With Elder Charms of Good Fortune acquired, and an average ilvl of 460, head into Mogu’shan Vaults, you can queue using the Raid Finder (default shortcut key: i)<br />
Crafted PvP items (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=458&amp;filter-ilvl-max=458&amp;filter-pvp-only=y&amp;filter-source=2) (ilvl 458) can help get you over the hump into Heroic dungeons<br />
Crafted ilvl 476 items (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=476&amp;filter-ilvl-max=476&amp;filter-source=2) (Gloves/Chest/Weapons/etc.) can help jumpstart you into LFR<br />
5.3 Battlefield Barrens quests will award ilvl 476 and 489 items<br />
476 belt (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-ilvl-min=476&amp;filter-ilvl-max=476&amp;filter-source=16384&amp;filter-slot=64) is purchasable from the Isle of Thunder Kirin Tor Offensive (A) or Sunreaver Onslaught (H) for gold<br />
476 Epic boots (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-ilvl-min=476&amp;filter-ilvl-max=476&amp;filter-source=1024&amp;filter-slot=256) available from a quest received by killing Sha of Anger (loot Claw of Anger)<br />
476 PvP items (http://www.wowdb.com/items/armor?filter-ilvl-min=476&amp;filter-ilvl-max=476&amp;filter-pvp-only=y) purchased with Honor can help fill in any gaps and raise your average ilvl with little negative effect to your overall ability in raids<br />
Shado-Pan Assault ilvl 522 neck available at Neutral for 1250 Valor Points<br />
Lesser Charms of Good Fortune can be exchanged at your faction’s shrine in the Vale of Eternal Blossoms for Mogu Runes of Fate. Mogu Runes provide bonus rolls for 5.2 bosses including those in the Throne of Thunder, and world bosses Oondasta and Nalak<br />

<br />
Hope to see you there!<br />

Scenarios and Dungeons<br />
Why is Blizzard pushing scenarios so much? Think of the amount of dungeons they could have made in this time. <br />
Scenarios are far quicker to create than dungeons. They don't just rely on specific class balance among other things. So, the time it would have taken to create a single new dungeon is much greater than most realize. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/260038-patch-53-scenario-preview/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/8728554139?page=1#18))<br />
<br />
Death Match Battleground<br />
Battle grounds have always been missing an important part of world pvp.... PvP. Make it like a big arena but not so big that people can't hide. 10 to 15 players forced into all out pvp. First to so many kills or 10 minutes, whichever comes first, wins the round.<br />
<br />
No need to even create an area for it. Just make a copy of Blackrock mountain in an instance. <br />
What you're asking for is a straight Death Match type of Battleground. I'm not sure it would be compelling as you think. I'm a big fan of DM as well, at least in FPS', but for an MMO like World of Warcraft, I question how enjoyable it would be in the long run for people. I think for players who feel very comfortable with their abilities, straight head on PvP like that would be fun for them, but for others, I'm not sure it would have the same appeal.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm not killing the discussion. I'm just interested in how you feel this would work or appeal to a wide enough audience for it to be worth creating.<br />
<br />
I think Southshore/Tarren Mill speak to it being desired. But that's gone now. <br />
People forget that Southshore/Tarren Mill occurred because there were no battlegrounds at the time. It was &quot;the place to go&quot; if you wanted mass amounts of faction vs. faction PvP. I remember, I was there. I also remember hoping a spell would go off in time. <br />
<br />
As much as I'd love to believe everyone loves PvP, it's not true. That said though, I think World of Warcraft has managed to introduce PvP to more people who may have never tried it before. This is a good thing. Creating interesting PvP encounters is important for continuing to keep people interested in it though.

Spectral Guise Side Effect<br />
Coming back to this one quickly; Spectral Guise removing a player from combat is not entirely a bug, but more of an unfortunate side-effect that's caused by the way the spell functions in order to accomplish particular tasks. We are fine that this perk is available through Spectral Guise and have no plans at this time to change the way the spell works.<br />
<br />
We're aware that the tooltip is currently incorrect in its current state and are looking to update it in an upcoming patch, however this will not be until patch 5.4 at the soonest.

It's all about racing to get enough ilvl to run LFR for most people and then farming LFR every week. I remember in Cataclysm I had a Level 25 random invite guild constantly capped at 1k people and all the guild challenges were always met every single week.<br />
<br />
In MoP, I had the same guild, 1k capped but now I'm lucky to see 1 run get done that goes towards Guild Challenges despite several efforts to form a real 25 raiding core or RBG core. There are people interested, but not nearly enough people to make a viable long term team and this was on Illidan - mind you of all servers.<br />
<br />
The Game In A Nutshell Now:<br />
Hit 90, get your iLvl to LFR status and run LFR. Then ride around in circles on your mount until Tuesday or work on achievements. Dailies were a nice touch at first but after you burn yourself out on the repetitive state of the same dailies every day, it gets tiring.

It has always been like that, just in vanilla the ilvl was hidden unless you had an add-on. But the game always was about getting to a certain number for most players ( nature resist!!!). The difference is back in vanilla, there were very limited ways go gear up. how about 4 months of running Stratholme... The difference now is there are a ton of options, and as we saw when mop launched, maybe too many options in that it became confusing ( still laughing at all the people who thought they had to do all the dailies). In any event, this type of post IS needed because of the options to gear up. In vanilla, it would just be ´go to Strat to finish your dungeon set)..</div></div><hr />

Before LFR normal/hm raiding was how you progressed once you got past 5mans, so of course there was more impetus to do them. Nowadays LFR can give a similar feeling while being easier and not having to be scheduled, so of course people are going to flock to it. Regular raiding is still the better option for both gear and fun though. <br />
<br />
As for immersion, that's entirely a matter of opinion, and I hardly see what grinding LFR has to do with it, because there have always, always been grinds in this game.</div></div><hr />

In MoP, I had the same guild, 1k capped but now I'm lucky to see 1 run get done that goes towards Guild Challenges despite several efforts to form a real 25 raiding core or RBG core. There are people interested, but not nearly enough people to make a viable long term team and this was on Illidan - mind you of all servers.<br />
<br />
The Game In A Nutshell Now:<br />
Hit 90, get your iLvl to LFR status and run LFR. Then ride around in circles on your mount until Tuesday or work on achievements. Dailies were a nice touch at first but after you burn yourself out on the repetitive state of the same dailies every day, it gets tiring. I enjoyed the repetitive dailies of BC far more than I do MoPs.. maybe I'm just not a fan of Pandaria.. even though the land is beautiful.<br />
<br />
Someone get this guy a tissue, he can't seem to stop crying about the same thing in practically every thread that has to do with LFR or any changes to the game -.-.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Get to 90 questing Tong-Long and Dreadwaste for reputation, you should get both to Honored by normal questing. You should as well be 430+ once you hit 90 from quest rewards.<br />
2. Do heroics and make sure to do the quests inside. Do not spend any justice points except to convert them to honor points.<br />
3. Wait till you reach the cap of 4k honor and 4k justice points, then go to the PvP vendor on the wall and fill up missing gear with PvP items. Rinse repeat until you have 460 ilvl.<br />
4. In the meantime make sure to kill one rare on the Isle of Thunder for the key and do the loot scenario (just open every chest in sight, no tactic required to get 15+ badges).<br />
5. Find a Sha, Galleon, Nalak and Ondasta raid, make sure to bonus-roll if you can.<br />
6. Run Mogushan (both raids) once, make sure to bonus-roll on every boss once (unless you already got something and there is no upgrade on that boss). You should have 470 ilvl now. If not get some more PvP gear from heros and/or buy the 522 neck from Shadow Pawn Assault.<br />
7. Run Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Springs, bonus roll on every boss once (unless you already got something and there is no upgrade on that boss). With the Shadow Pan Assault neck and bonus rolls you should be 480 now. If not check your gear for the worst ilvl and re-run HoF/ToES and bonus roll only on those bosses that have a chance to upgrade your worst items.<br />
8. If nothing else works you can get additional gear from Klaxxi/Shadow Pan, but this is just last resort as the ilvl is low compared to the ToT gear/rewards.<br />
9. Run Throne of Thunder.<br />
<br />
If you get lucky you can run ToT on the first week, 2nd week latest, without ever doing a single daily.</div></div><hr />

Me too, it makes me sad too because my girlfriend may miss out on 5.3.<br />

The argument, I suppose, is that events are made precious by time-limitation... but still I'd prefer an option, or a hint from Blizzard, that they'd let players revisit these events via the Caverns of Time (for example).</div></div><hr />

Been part of a hardcore / semi-hc (depends where you draw the line, we usually kill the end boss on HC before a new tier starts. 4x 3 hour raids/week) guild for ages now.. we have taken in alot of low geared people, it isnt as hard as you think.

<br />
1. At least get your facts straight, hc dungeons require 435 not 440, it hasn't been 440 for over 5 months now, surely someone got the memo.<br />
2. Gear means very little in terms of performance unless you are skilled, i've seen plenty of people lesser geared outperforming those with better gear because the better geared was just lucky with rolls or got carried. Rather than just telling people to get gear for lfr and do hcs, why not also emphasise the importance of sites such as icy-veins and ask mr robot as well as other specialist sites for certain classes and specs, there is no point rushing people through content, if you are essentially forcing other player to have to pick up their game moreso for their ignorance.<br />
<br />
The reason so many players are not hit capped exp capped or geared correctly and playing poorly in dungeons and lfr etc, is Blizzard's fault, the community can only offer so much, but so many players will only listen to Blizzard's divine given word, that unless Blizzard recommends it they will just continue. Another welcome change (as I hear too many players complaining about the cost of reforging) is just remove the cost of reforging completely, while for richer players it does help get rid of some gold, for the new players who know very little about making gold, that is at least a small help.</div></div><hr />

Urh, yeah I really don't like wowdb, either, but I suppose MMO-Champion have to promote their own system.

Try the same thing with my priest it's quite easy to die. I could go slower and clear the mobs before just running through, but that takes far too long for a daily grind: I can appreciate the argument that things shouldnt be too easy, but honestly, when it comes to the chore of dailies, and they are a chore, I want to get them over and done ASAP so I can go and do something fun, like play another game until the raid starts.<br />

To be honest running easy dungeons for high ilevel items might be great and efficient for players, but my god is it boring to run the same dungeons throughout an entire expansion. Plus, in Cata half the raiding content was obsolete before the expansion even ended. Its just very bad design no matter how much you enjoy it.</div></div><hr />

Yes a lot of the PuGs now revolve around scheduling using 3rd party methods. I left some context out in my post. I mean that PuG raiding had been around for years. There are still PuGs just not many left after the introduction of LFR on my server. PuG raiding was alive and kicking on my realm after the removal of separate raid lockouts. I was able to find a &quot;newb&quot; PuG for Firelands before the nerf for my two week old lvl 85. The big hit to PuG raiding on my realm happened when LFR hit. PuG raiding did exist that was accessible for those who did not want to play around a schedule. Even then players liked to ignore that fact because it makes it easier for their argument that casuals could not raid despite the existence of casuals raiding.</div></div><hr />

The real problem is they haven't even bothered to add a single new 5-man since launch. They've put all their time and effort for small group play into Scenarios, which are possibly the worst time investment past running the first one per day in the game.<br />
<br />
I get that they're trying to force people to do the old content first ala BC, but holy hell is it annoying for alts. At least give us a single new dungeon that drops 476 gear. Having to use PVP gear to get into LFR is annoying and dealing with people who whine about it is even moreso. Crafted gear is not a solution at 600g per living steel bar and 250 per blood spirit.</div></div><hr />

removing the gating was a good step, letting august celestial, shado-pan, golden lotus, klaxxi epics go for JP would solve a lot of the issues. and I'm surprised it hasn't been done since thats how its been since wrath. reason being, and its not free epics, its to meet ilvl requirements. especially with ToT out. people would have an enticement to run 5 mans, people with excess JP would be able to aquire off spec stuff if need be. <br />

in the past there was always pieces that were BoE, like bracers etc, where you could use your stuff to gear alts. this whole &quot;grinding&quot; of things really does take a lot of the fun out of things.

If the MoP gearing process is confusing to you, the only thing I can see is that you are intentionally trying to not understand it, because that's the only way I can see it being hard.<br />
<br />
&quot;Run Dungeons - Buy Gear&quot; is boring as shit, and is why I spent most of Cataclysm flying laps around Stormwind trying to think of something to do. WoW has a lot of content in it now, and if you want to reach the &quot;end&quot; of it, you should have to do most of it. Why are dungeons so special that they should be the only thing you have to do to get ready for the end game. You should have to do dungeons, do story quests, do dailies, do scenarios, because that's what the game has.</div></div><hr />

WoW has always been a gear based game. Is it a great game? YES. However, is the carrot on a stick formula getting old? YES.<br />
<br />
Really wish someone would come out with a real story driven MMO. Less gear development and more actual character development.</div></div><hr />

They very fact that they had to create a blog telling you how to gear (a process that was almost always self explanatory in the past i.e you run dungeons) suggests that it is indeed very confusing.<br />
<br />
The rest of what you wrote is drivel and can be dismissed as such. I want to dungeon and raid and I want it to be the most optimal process or optimal enough that I can do it in a day or two. I don't care for the rest of what wow has because it's pretty shitty. The story is pretty shitty, the immersion is almost nowhere to be found, dailies about the most mind numbding tedious chore I can think of (questing in general is), scenarios have no appeal and next to nobody does them.</div></div><hr />

Nice opinion. I find 5 man dungeons (except for trying to gold challenge modes) to be the most boring content in the game. It's the same fomula everytime. Tank runs in, AoE, kill easy boss, repeat. Obviously someone else might find this to not be true (like yourself). That's why the game has options. They are making the game for millions of players, not for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The story is pretty shitty, the immersion is almost nowhere to be found, dailies about the most mind numbding tedious chore I can think of (questing in general is), scenarios have no appeal and next to nobody does them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warcraft actually has a very good story compared to most MMOs. If you actually bother to read the lore items, and a lot of the quest text (especially from Cho) there is actually a ton of depth that most people are skipping over in the name of &quot;efficiency&quot;. I enjoy doing dailies, however I know that's an unpopular theory so I wont bother trying to defend it.<br />
<br />
Also, as someone with 7 max level characters, and likely 11 by the end of MoP, I will also respectfully disagree that questing is boring. There is a lot of charm to getting home from work and logging on a mid level character and relaxing by going through quests for 30-60 minutes while listening to music and having a drink. It's become sort of habit for me, and I'd hate to see it made irrelevant because some forum troll thinks they are boring.</div></div><hr />
