Coldlight Surfrunner and Island Expedition Loot Clarifications and Updates<br />
Any new about Coldlight Surfrunner pet from Island Expeditions?is the last pet i miss and yet 0% of player base received it,also 2nd time murloc appear on Whispering Reef,feedback will be appreciated!!<br />
There are different Murloc tribes in Azeroth, and so far, the kind of Murlocs that could drop Coldlight Surfrunner have not appeared on Island Expeditions. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1065000911376773120))<br />
<br />
After our earlier tweet, we are working on a hotfix so that the Coldlight Surfrunner can drop when ANY murloc type is present on an Island Expedition. Furthermore, we're simplifying this entire system in Tides of Vengeance. More details on that soon. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1065080683058487297))<br />
<br />
<br />
BfA PvP Season 1 Will Not End on December 11th<br />
As we’re now three weeks from beginning the Tides of Vengeance content update, we wanted to make it known that the current PvP Season will not be ending at that time.<br />
<br />
We expect to end the current season in January 2019, and we will provide an exact date for that in a few weeks.</div></div><hr />

The thing that bothers me most is I was tweeting at devs the issues on Argus and with Invasions in regards to loot drops and expressing I hoped there wouldn't be similar in Legion, and then they doubled down on it. I know they saw those tweets, too, they even interacted with some.</div></div><hr />

That's a ridiculous reason to stagger the content yet again! They have released patches and even whole expansions in December before.<br />
<br />
That makes it close to 5 months for uldir, I can't remember any longer raid-content drought after a first tier since cataclysm, but that had 3 raids.</div></div><hr />

coprax specifically stated &quot;I can't remember any longer raid-content drought after a first tier since cataclysm&quot;, probably meaning between the first and second tiers of an expansion.</div></div><hr />

That delay has NOT always been there, startet with WOD I think. ;)<br />

I specifically said First Tier Content, not end tier or anything else. Please learn to read and comprehend before arguing.</div></div><hr />

Everything is being delayed this expansion, 8.1 itself is over a month late. But people will come and say &quot;have you cleared Mythic?&quot; no, and no one cares, Mythic is not most peoples end game. Raid should have been out in dec, or at least another small one like in Legion.</div></div><hr />

Actually in this case I don't think they are lying. The cold light murlocks are the deep sea angler fish looking ones. I don't recall coming across those at all yet but they are one of the enemy types in the possible mix. The problem is their RNG is such that its possible to simply not see one enemy type for a long time and then during that window having a very low chance of actually getting the drop needed.</div></div><hr />

Nighthold didn't release until mid January. Yes there was the mini-raid ToV, but this time the mini raid is coming between zuldazar and azshara raid for lore reasons meaning the smaller gap will be between 2nd and 3rd full raids instead of 1st and 2nd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the other difficulties are faceroll status. It takes 1 hour to clear normal and 1.5 hours for heroic.<br />
<br />
The tier is ending, they're trying to allow guilds that are still progging a chance to clear the table before the next tier comes out.<br />
<br />
This is the usual pattern. Nothing new.</div></div><hr />

Actually, Coldlight Seers and Coastrunners were part of the Murloc enemy group last week. Yes, they were Deep Sea Murlocs, and yes there were rares. They were mixed in with regular Murlocs, as well as Gorlocs in the &quot;Murloc&quot; group. What's odd is that Blizzard has stated that the specific enemy that drops the pet hasn't spawned, but Coldlight Murlocs definitely have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the patch is being released in December, raid in January. makes perfect sense, people will be back from holidays and they can do the world first race (mostly) evenly.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont get it. Why do they have 4 diffrent dificulties on raids to get casuals a chanse to see the raid but then they nerf the hardest content..<br />

because it helps people currently still progressing on those fights. you're not going to get people going from LFR to Mythic because of these changes.</div></div><hr />

This is a stupid thing to say.<br />
<br />
Vanilla's pace was MUCH, MUCH slower, plus had MC, BWL, and Onyxia before ZG, which by the way, DID NOT release 5 months after Vanilla (It was released in September 2005.. That's 10 months)<br />
<br />
TBC had Gruul's Lair, Karazhan, Mag's Lair, The Eye, and SSC.<br />
<br />
WotLK had Naxx, Malygos, and Obsidian Dragonshrine.<br />
<br />
Cata had BWD, Bastion of Twilight, and Throne of the Four Winds<br />
<br />
MoP had Heart of Fear, Mogu'shan Vaults and Terrace of Endless Spring<br />
<br />
Even freaking WoD with its mess of an expansion came out with BRF faster. Legion had more raid content out faster, too.</div></div><hr />

Not even joking...not even exaggerating. We once pulled him over 10x in a single day and I got it every time (in a raid of about 20). WHY DOES HE HATE ME SO?! Even tried jumping down the pit after everyone else had.....nope. Still hates me.<br />
<br />
I think I may have done something horrible to him in another life and he holds a grudge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm with you, though I don't raid these days, in the guilds I have raided in we were very often on the edge of a kill/clear when the big nerfs rolled out. This was always demoralizing, as it made the kill feel hollow and meaningless. I would rather try and fail with a good story to tell about it than have it handed to me.<br />
<br />
Nerfs on mythic above early adjustments are just dumb. If the easier difficulties are all a faceroll, that's what they should work on getting right. I'd prefer they leave mythic alone.</div></div><hr />

Back to this news, I'm just really peeved that Kul Tirans and Zandalari are being withheld and withheld again LONG AFTER they should have become available to play in the 'story'.</div></div><hr />

Same, we are on P3 pulls now, got 2 raids left. No one wants it to get nerfed. If the nerfs will be what it says.. it's a joke fight after.</div></div><hr />

To be fair for most people playing back then they couldn’t even reach max level in the entire duration of current expansions.</div></div><hr />

It’s not your fault.<br />
In the normal forums to quote someone you have to click BELOW his message, when you quote in these type of threads dunno why you have to click ABOVE his message.<br />
<br />
Quite confusing, I misquote all the times.</div></div><hr />

Are you standing on the side with the path u go down to ghuun? I stand on that side and during progression i had 75 ruin debuffs throughout the attempts, while some had like 6. There is definitely something in the ruin code based off player's location in the room. Even in our rekills, I still get it way more than most.</div></div><hr />

I stand where the rest of my team does D:<br />
<br />
We all jump from the same spot, and land in the middle. I've even gotten Ruin while FALLING DOWN towards him.<br />
<br />
Guy just hates me :(</div></div><hr />
