Patch 7.3 adds a new Heirloom neck item, the Man'ari Training Amulet (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/153130-manari-training-amulet). This item allows you to sacrifice 10% health to increase movement speed by 40% for 10 sec.<br />
<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Back when you were working on WoW, how much did the concept of “theme park” vs “sandbox” influence the drawing board? Did you guys identify with one side more than another on a scale, or did you consider WoW to be it’s own entity, and introduce features to fit the current trend of gameplay?<br />
WoW followed the theme park philosophy pretty strongly. Before WoW, MMOs were much more about creating an “interesting” (quotes intentional) world in which players could go find “fun” things to do. But often that fun devolved into grinding mobs. WoW was explicit about constantly providing directed gameplay, largely through quests. Rather than the quests petering out and reaching the point where you have to grind, in WoW the quests just never ran out. There are even way more quests than you need in order to reach max level, and increasingly there are even quests at max level. Quests aren’t even the only system that provides stuff for players to do.<br />
<br />
Beyond just WoW, I’ll be a little controversial here and say that I worry that the importance of sandboxes to successful game design gets overstated. I’ve also noticed that it is game reviewers who get really excited about open-ended gameplay, and I’m sure part of that reason is because they have to play through so many games at a frenetic pace that something where they get to set the rules is appealing.<br />
<br />
And I do get the appeal of sandboxes. It’s just that so often the game can’t often deliver on the massive expectations of what a sandbox really is. I get really bored of games where I have to go find the fun or invent my own fun, usually because games can’t ever really deliver on “Anything that you can conceive, you can do.” Instead I always find myself bumping into the limitations of the system. I can’t really be a thief who just survives stealing from other players. I can’t really be a merchant or a politician or a prophet because the game systems aren’t robust enough to support that. Minecraft lets you make ridiculously elaborate architecture. GTA is funny when the cop AI collides with semi-realistic car physics. But both are still pretty limited in terms of sandboxes. <br />
<br />
(My favorite game is D&amp;D, where a human dungeon master does allow you to do almost anything you can dream up. Computers are far behind.)<br />
<br />
I could talk a lot about Breath of the Wild. It is a fantastic game. But I also do get bored sometimes when I climb a mountain just to find nothing interesting up on top. Yes, it’s great that the game lets me climb any mountain. That freedom is amazing. But I’m going to stop doing it if I keep finding boring mountaintops. Watching the different systems interact in ways that you would expect (”Lightning is attracted to metal!” “Bombs can move things when they explode!” is fun to witness and maybe entertaining from a creative expression standpoint. But that doesn’t automatically make it fun. I still want something engaging. If it can be an engaging open world game, great. But if it’s just an open world game, I’m going to move on to another game quickly.<br />
<br />
I completely realize this is personal preference, but I’d rather designers give me an experience that they think would be fun for me, rather than giving me a tool set and letting me invent the fun. But I’m a guy who loves Lego, but never builds anything other than the model the boxed sets are designed to make. YMMV.

<br />
And I like that GC keeps giving honest answers that basically smack down any notion of that. People have been bitching that WoW &quot;has lost it's sandbox feel.&quot; It's good to hear GC's perspective that it was never really &quot;sandbox&quot; to begin with. And, frankly, I agree with him. Not only in respect to WoW but in regards to the fact that games that make players &quot;make their own fun&quot; ultimately lose a lot of people because it stops feeling rewarding. No Man's Sky really came to mind in that regard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean...you are objectively wrong....<br />
<br />
the only other neck is one that gives a very small heal.<br />
<br />
the fact that some people still use those boot rockest that can almost kill you is proof there is want for this. I'm sure you'll lag behind in dungeons while players who know how to play are already engaging the boss because they use stuff like this in places you cant mount.<br />

maybe dont insult the devs just because you lack vision</div></div><hr />

Can always buy those sets from Darkmoon Faire with tokens or go Molten Core for that one plate set.<br />
<br />
They are basically Dungeon Tier 1 or 2 if I recall. Except the one Plate one that uses the T1 look.<br />

<br />
It's less about development time (non-visible items are just database entries anyway) and more that they probably don't want every slot filled by heirlooms. I may be wrong, but I swear I read something somewhere where they said something to that effect.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree. The best games I've ever played were a combo of theme + sandbox. Vanilla wow had some of that Emergent gameplay (ie. SS vs TM) but it was unrealized and undeveloped. I think Blizzard always meant for WoW even in Vanilla to be a fully controlled themepark, but didn't have the resources at the time. Kinda sad, actually. There is always a problem when the developers decide for you what is fun in such an open world like WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For people who lvl in pvp (and those who do are lucky, since the heirlooms required for that are retardedly difficult to get),<br />
sure, this **could** be useful.<br />
<br />
But for the most part, its very underwhelming.</div></div><hr />

Plz no, Sandbox game are stupid, bc they are really weak on the graphic department. Im glad blizzard isnt doing that, maybe that is the reason i keep playing this game for over 10 years.<br />
<br />
someone early post that ultima online was great bc you can live stealing from players. THAT IS THE MAIN PROBLEM with sandbox game, assholes that exploit low level zones, ALL sandbox game have that problem, just watch Ark where a dude build a trap around whrere level 1 character spawns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That gets back to the problem Ghostcrabs was talking about. Bad actors get free rein to do whatever they please and without any meaningful consequences (such as perma-death or prison) will eventually grow to dominate the game because the majority of non jerk players can't effectively fight back against them.<br />
<br />
Not fighting in the PVP sense but bringing order to anarchy by forming governments and police forces for example. This is why these types of sandbox games will always fail and devolve into whatever chaotic evil people/trolls with the longest attention spans want; because game systems are too limited to help the lawful players out. (See Elite: Dangerous)</div></div><hr />

So as far as I am concerned, please don't post this stuff from GC. He admited not playing WoW since he left Blizz, he knows nothing about the current status of the game, his posts are his visions about game design or w/e only very few people I think are interested in.</div></div><hr />

Using Breath of the Wild as an exemple of what is not fun in sandbox, is at least quite inaccurate ... The argument of not finding anything interesting at top of a mountain, is fallacious as on each moutain there is at least of the damn Korok seed or how explicitly each point of interest is noticeable from afar, bright orange sanctuaries, light halos on basically anything meaningful. I don't want to put aside any debate about BotW, but it quite certain it is close to be a masterpiece of open world game design. The way GC, use BotW, only proves his disabilty to understand open worlds.<br />
<br />
Another point on how bad is BotW exemple, is the total absence of multiplayer component in BotW, making open-world solo games and MMO barely comparable. <br />

Anyway, that's the last part that made me create an account to comment this : &quot;I completely realize this is personal preference, but I’d rather designers give me an experience that they think would be fun for me, rather than giving me a tool set and letting me invent the fun&quot;.<br />
<br />
Designing an open world with that mindset, is like designing a bird with the intend to make it swin ... I perfectly understand the preference thing but you can't design a Street Fighter game to make its gameplay like The Last of Us. World of Warcraft is an open world game, you need to design an open world game. If they didn't intend to let players making their own fun, why did they build an open world in the first place ? It does not make any sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
someone early post that ultima online was great bc you can live stealing from players. THAT IS THE MAIN PROBLEM with sandbox game, assholes that exploit low level zones, ALL sandbox game have that problem, just watch Ark where a dude build a trap around whrere level 1 character spawns.<br />
<br />
And this was never a problem in WoW? I can't tell how many DK noobs I had to gank in the orc and troll starting area in WoW after WotLk hit. Or how many people I killed on a daily basis in STV on the alliance flight point or Nesingwarys.<br />
<br />
Nothing of what you said is exclusive to a sandbox mmorpg.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nairesha</div><div class="date">2017-08-22, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A sandbox game is not = a sandbox MMO. Those CANNOT be compared. Period. And GhostC. did - which is as far off as can be.<br />
BotW is/was addicting to the core! No matter where you went (and worked your way to get there or survive there) was a great experience. You always found something new or worth your while - like the far off secluded island of trial (or whatever it was). I was so curious and landed there quite early, not knowing my ropes - left and tried again later.<br />
<br />
Now in MMOs this kinda thing used to SORT of work. While WoW was and never will be open world, it still gave a good feel of having a large map. So in Stranglethorn, the Island of Apes (or whatever the name was) was rumoured during Vanilla. Both Location, how to best get over there and what you'd find there.<br />
<br />
Nowadays these &quot;easter eggs&quot; are done differently, in the form of mounts (the mindflayer thingie) or toys and so on. It's just not for everyone. But the big miraculous &quot;how to I get there&quot; or &quot;how do I get the material to get there&quot; is a total lack in WoW - would an MMO benefit of this? You know what: probably, but NOT WoW players.</div></div><hr />

I beg to disagree, maybe we can debate on the &quot;open world&quot; definition, yet if you started as a lvl 1 dwarf, you could drag your ass up to Stormwind, because no frontier in the world forbade it. You could tried to get a kill on Sylvanas with your lame level 1 or explore STV. The world had no frontier hence the term &quot;open world&quot;. You can farm/craft/explore/quest/pvp in no particular environnement deticated to such activities.</div></div><hr />

Official prediction: Corpse runs in Antorus are gonna be huge so you will have to equip this just to get to the boss before raid time is over. Literally that is the only useful application I can see for this necklace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but this is my point, you get gank, and you can just move away from it, easy, over my 10 year playing i have assholes that gank me over and over, but i always find a way to move a way from them, just running to town or flying away or asking for help.<br />
<br />
On this sandbox game, they can exploint mechanic to ignore this, like my point on ark, or i cant remmeber the game name, that a dude trap someone inside a house he build around where he log off. <br />
<br />
Sandbox allow player the freedom to troll other player to dead. Hell i still remember this first mmo where you get troll by idiots that live just stealing from low levels on servers.<br />

I couldn't agree more with Ghostcrawler on this. I'm not a big fan of sandbox games, in fact I hate them.<br />

For me bc i have see this multiple times, on sandbox game is easy to groups of player or some ppl with alot of time to screw others.</div></div><hr />

I think a combination is appropriate. I really enjoyed sandbox games like UO and EQ when I played them. WoW kinda sucked some of the fun out of things by putting everything on rails.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He mentions D&amp;D, but -at least for me- a good sandbox is one that give you the tool to be a GM. RPG in WoW is actually limited to talking and erp, as the world can't be changed. But thousand are still doing it! Imagine if we had more tools...<br />
<br />
Also when he said that a sandbox with merchants and politicians and prophets &quot;can't be robust enough&quot;, well it would be nice to have more details. Why can't it be made ? I'm not expected real-life simulation of course, but a something simple as &quot;become the mayer of Lakeshire&quot; with a couple of options (rent houses, set tax for hearthstone there, allow/forbid pvp, edit a newspaper etc.) CAN be made, especially by a multi-billion dollars company.</div></div><hr />
