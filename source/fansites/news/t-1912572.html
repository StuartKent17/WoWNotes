I thought it was supposed to be actually Acherus, wasn't it? Nobody said that every class is gonna get a whole new hall. DKs already had theirs, it's moving to Broken Isles and there really isn't a good reason for them to find a new one. It's gonna get new features, but I guess those aren't implemented on beta yet, so it looks pretty much the same.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I guess we all expected a bit more from class halls. I'm an undead shadow...and a mix of Shatt and Exodar just isn't the place I want as class hall either.<br />
<br />
And if you then see a warrior complain here although that is likely the best looking hall(hey, I would like to have that one although it has nothing to do with undead shadows...but it at least looks good!) together with maybe druids...well...</div></div><hr />

Halls of Valor, ruled by the Titan Keeper Odyn. Also a level-up dungeon in Stormheim. Would be neat if Odyn reacts differently if a Warrior does the dungeon. :P</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I'm pretty disappointed with the Warlock hall. I feel like at least some of the other halls got something that fit them a bit better. First the Demon Hunters stole our moves, now we are stuck with pretty much the same class hall, but without any of the cool looking NPCs and accouterments. I really hope they flesh it out a lot more. Green fire and rocks are going to be pretty boring very quickly.</div></div><hr />

I assumed DKs and Monks were already set because they had their unique zones. Though Druids getting a new area surprised me, so I can see the argument saying that the class hall should be a new area.<br />
<br />
Either way, my DK will be fine. I'm not sure what everyone expected, but from the pictures (and video) I'm seeing it fits my expectations. I'm looking to use the Class Hall in a utilitarian manner. Not looking to hang out and/or spend a lot of time there. I also like the portals (from the mage hall). Hoping every class hall gets them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bearing in mind that these are early looks of the class halls...<br />
<br />
The point being that outside of some new NPCs, thus far, that one is exactly the same, as in, developed in super-early Wrath.<br />
<br />
I think most players were hoping for updated areas. Acherus could be the same layout, but it should look new with higher res textures and more detail in general.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, Class Halls are a major selling point of Legion. I don't think it's unreasonable for people to be a little shocked that most of these locations look copy/pasted and/or pretty dull.<br />
<br />
I can't even find the words for how disappointing the rogue class hall is. Is that Vanessa VanCleef? Gonna resurrect yet another character...c'mon now.</div></div><hr />

What's the point, it's exactly, *exactly* like the sewers we've known for seven years. Trash the work you've done, Blizzard, and update Ravenholdt. So far, I'll hold judgment on the DK Hall, until or unless we find out there's really nothing new in store for Achereus. <br />
<br />
Personally I'm most impressed by the Warrior Hall. Don't know if I'll ever make one, but damn is that place pretty. Everything else is okay enough, I guess, but most of it feels like places we've been.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of - I've never gotten why sewers are particularly rogue-like. Sure, they may fit a Thieve's Guild, but the WoW version of a rogue includes more than just the common thief, like the professional assassin and the swashbuckler - Not exactly who I'd expect to reside in sewers. <br />
<br />
Secondly - I could've probably lived with the sewers, had they been somehow updated. If it had looked like the rogues had actually done something with the place, but it's almost, to a tee, like the original Dalaran sewers. <br />
<br />
An underground location beneath a city can work well, if you want to go with a hidden network-kind-of-thing, but then make it that. While Assassin's Creed Unity isn't a particularly good game, I feel they got one thing right about shadowy operations - They would have some sort of respectable facade (for those not in the know - In AC:U the Assassin's work from beneath a respectable street-corner coffee house). Why not do the same here? Ravenholdt, as more have mentioned, comes to mind. It's not exactly a secret, but it could fairly easily be hidden away as simply the hideaway of an eccentric lord.<br />
<br />
I guess, in the end, I just don't see any EFFORT in the rogue class hall. At all.<br />
<br />
/Personal opinion and all that.<br />
<br />
Edit: The mage class hall is more shadowy, for crying out loud!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is supposed to be an epic fantasy MMO. Legion is supposed to be revive the game from their admitted mistakes. Class halls are a main feature of Legion that we will travel to throughout the expansion. Their design team is the biggest it has ever been.<br />
<br />
This is what we get. A collection of uninspired bland locations. The Mage class hall is a literally a hall. With a bookcases. That is how they capture the fantasy of the class?, of arcane, fire, and frost. A dark dusty stone hall with a bookcases of books.<br />
<br />
Looking through them all, same feeling throughout. This isn't something that can be fixed with asset tweaks, they are fundamentally boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point being that outside of some new NPCs, thus far, that one is exactly the same, as in, developed in super-early Wrath.<br />
<br />
I think most players were hoping for updated areas. Acherus could be the same layout, but it should look new with higher res textures and more detail in general.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, Class Halls are a major selling point of Legion. I don't think it's unreasonable for people to be a little shocked that most of these locations look copy/pasted and/or pretty dull.<br />
<br />
I can't even find the words for how disappointing the rogue class hall is. Is that Vanessa VanCleef? Gonna resurrect yet another character...c'mon now.<br />

With the exception of the Rogue hall. It's garbage, no way to twist that. I realise that it is hard to find a common theme between Rogues, since they range from lowly street rats to highly professional assassins, but this is just a terrible, lazy solution.</div></div><hr />

I heard that arguement countless of times. Basicly we have that every expansion when it comes to shadows being underpowered. We shall just wait cause it is not final...and then it's final and it's still underpowered. Every single time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a temple, Karabor. Heavyily tied to priests in the lore. The holy priest(which in my opinion is the essence of priesthood - shadow and disc are more like sub-paths aka more rare) artifact is tied to the Naaru(beings of pure light), and so is clearly the priest class hall - so it makes sense. The problem is more that holy and to some extent disc priests probably wouldn't want anything to do with shadow priests from a lore perspective. I don't think shadow priests, just like warlocks, are welcome in the Horde and especially not in the Alliance - so I can see why they would put a bit more focus on the holy side of priests for the class hall rather than the shadow side. And even so, I think a temple can fit shadow priests just as well. Just because there's light and yellow colours, it can still be a rather gloomy place with a tint of a dark atmosphere.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying they get every little detail right(candles in the shape of skulls for the paladin class hall as you mentioned), but Blizzard probably wanted to have different looking places(not two cathedrals) for priests and paladins, aswell as using Temple of Karabor as they scrapped the idea of using it as the major city for the Alliance in WoD to the players outrage. Temples fits priests really well, just as well as cathedrals.</div></div><hr />

Don't speak for other people, speak for yourself. Feedback on the forums over the last span of time since they announced the location has pages upon pages upon pages of Rogues who hate the fact we're (as I main a Rogue, have since pre-Wrath) being shoved like pieces of crap into the sewers. Not to mention it's Dalaran's sewers, because nothing says &quot;sneaky&quot; like the sewers of a metric buttload of Mages with wards, right? <br />
<br />
You're damned right we're here to complain. No other class got stuck under pipes full of waste, we did. I think getting flushed on and basically told &quot;lol you're stuck with it&quot; is reason enough to make any class who has that kind of treatment done to them, a little bit upset. Rogues have been getting shafted for years, this was the last straw on an already heavy stack. If this goes live, I'll be jumping on the Demon Hunter bandwagon or making my Druid my new main. Many people have said (including me) that Ravenholdt would be a much better class hall. It's been said since announcement. I'm pretty sure that if they did change it to Ravenholdt, a hell of a lot of people would probably be pleased (again, including me). At least then it wouldn't feel like we're getting shoved into a corner and made to settle for something that doesn't even have anything to do with Rogues. <br />
<br />
If they're going to stick us in a sewer, Undercity is a hell of a lot more Rogue-centric than Dalaran.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, nightelfes are pretty much in the same boat as the horde priests and shadows. A draenei-dome just doesn't feel right or makes sense at all.

True, but then you don't choose one and take that direction to the extreme. Especially not if it's a rather ancient class like priest that you then place in a space alien building.

It is Valhalla and at the head of it all is Odin or &quot;Odyn&quot; very Viking/Warrior themed. So technically its heaven not Firelands. Viking architecture, great forges, great feasts, statues of warriors deemed worthy of making statues of, and Valkyries welcoming new &quot;worthy&quot; warriors to the halls after their deaths.</div></div><hr />

I just feel like people are putting too much personal emphasis on these halls like they are an extension of your character or something.

As for the Rogue's Class Hall, it's just shit. No other way of describing it. It's literally Dalaran sewers with piles of gold and a couple more tables thrown about and apparently it has the power to resurrect dead dungeon bosses, pull in the Iron Horde as well as people who aren't technically rogues to a place they would never usually go to. Also so much for a hidden, inconspicuous base as they said it was going to be.

The Naaru have an affinity for the same light that most other races use so while they might not necessarily have history with the naaru themselves, there is still some that the naaru can teach them. Night Elves on the other hand are trickier because they worship Elune. <br />
<br />
However, Velen visited Darnassus and offered advice on how to commune with powerful Naaru to Tyrande. She refused the help, believing that their light comes from Elune and not the Naaru but Blizz responded in an ask a dev panel to a question regarding whether Velen actually did see a connection or not a while back with &quot;Velen has been a prophet of the naaru for many thousands of years, and it’s unlikely that he would propose such a theory without significant evidence and consideration.&quot;. It has been speculated a lot that Elune may be a Naaru on the moon (why Velen would suggest Tyrande learning how to better communicate with naaru) or at least is connected with the naaru.</div></div><hr />

Night Elves on the other hand are trickier because they worship Elune. <br />
<br />
However, Velen visited Darnassus and offered advice on how to commune with powerful Naaru to Tyrande. She refused the help, believing that their light comes from Elune and not the Naaru but Blizz responded in an ask a dev panel to a question regarding whether Velen actually did see a connection or not a while back with &quot;Velen has been a prophet of the naaru for many thousands of years, and it’s unlikely that he would propose such a theory without significant evidence and consideration.&quot;. It has been speculated a lot that Elune may be a Naaru on the moon (why Velen would suggest Tyrande learning how to better communicate with naaru) or at least is connected with the naaru.<br />
<br />
I know that story and it's even more a reason for night elves not to be there. <br />
If their high priestess doesn't believe in that nonsense, the one that Elune actually has spoken to in the past, there is no reason for rest of the night elves to do either.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't entirely say that. Mages and druids seem pretty happy overall. As a mage main I'm pretty satisfied with mine. I don't quite understand the hate for the Priest and Hunter's halls. It's all subjective in the end I suppose. <br />
<br />
And on that subjective note I still have to say I find the Rogue class hall incredibly scummy looking and really awful. It's by far my least favorite here.</div></div><hr />

I'm utterly disappointed with the priest hall and the artefacts. :(<br />
Night elves aren't the only priests in Warcraft lore. In fact there are eleven other races that can be priests. I just wish Blizzard were aware of esteemed mmo-champion dot com forum poster, Plehnard's views, when coming up for ideas on what the Priest class hall and artefact weapon should have been.</div></div><hr />

I'm extremely happy about my own Class Hall, but dancing in the streets about it feels gauche when people I care about have such crap to look forward to. At least two of these are superb, about half are great... but the Rogue Hall is just unacceptable. This is exactly what people feared when the announcement first came out, and Blizzard promised it would be spectacular and not at all what people expected. Not only isn't it not spectacular, it's literally what everybody expected.<br />
<br />
It's not too late for Blizzard to add new areas to Ravenholdt, it's really not. They have to be made to hear reason. Is literally *anybody* [limiting &quot;anybody&quot; to those who play rogues] happy with this?</div></div><hr />

I get what they were going with, but class halls need to mean something to a class, not just reflect the feel. I'm not even a Rogue player, I've never made one, but even I recognize the massive sewer error. Death Knights, Druids, Monks, and Paladins were obvious no-brainers. I honestly don't recognize the rest, or they're new, but I hope they reconsider Rogues, even though they already set up stuff. Hell, throw in some kind of minor in-class faction story and break up the Rogues between the sewers and Ravenholdt. Maybe even make Alliance/Horde distinctions but without restrictions, just lore, letting all players go to both freely.</div></div><hr />

That's cool, the empty low res terrain looks pretty bland though... definitely needs some work. Some of the halls look a bit boring and uninspired. Warrior hall though, simply gorgeous. However still not sold on how interesting these will be game play wise as a &quot;major feature&quot; of the expansion. I mean DKs and Monks already have class halls... and I never really went there to hang out. You pretty much go there a few times, say this looks nice, then you're done. Eventually a building is just a building no matter how nice it looks and I'm not sure a few quest giving NPCs and an artifact table will make a difference. Seems like it could get dull fast and there might not be much depth to this major &quot;feature&quot;. Monks and DKs especially might get bored fast, if their halls really are staying pretty much the same..<br />
<br />
The artifact quest is surprisingly cool though, can't believe they're making 36 of those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I &quot;think&quot; it's meant to represent Valhalla, the Viking version of &quot;heaven.&quot; A place where the greatest of warriors went after death. <br />
<br />
I'm basing this off the prominent presence of Vrykul. The Vrykul were Blizzards version of Vikings and just about every aspect of them, their culture, and mythology...not to mention other aspects of the WotLK expansion...were pulled from Vikings and their lore.</div></div><hr />

And is the LK going to give the knights the cold shoulder as well?<br />

Also that remodeling hes done in there? <br />

It's a secure, massive speakeasy cunningly established beneath the feet of the most paranoid group of magic users on Azeroth. Someone set this up then threw away the key. You don't get in if you don't have the skills required to be the best of the best.<br />
<br />
If you put it in Hillbarad, It would be the only class hall without even the barest hint of a reason for being able to magically teleport there at will. (Paladins and Priest at least have magic, Shaman go to the twisting heart of the elements, Warrior presumably has Odyn using magic on them.) Everyone else is either physically present on the Shattered Isles or off on a Legion held world.<br />
<br />
Ravenholt? Ravenholt is a small handful of burned out starting zone buildings in the middle of nowhere. Give me something secure, hidden, with an army of unwitting defenders to protect it.</div></div><hr />

Well, they thought &quot;Priest class hall looks empty and boring...let's put a dragon head on a pole and then it's cool. And that together with a crytalline space alien catches the idea of priests perfectly!&quot;. Simple. :cool:<br />

I main a Resto Druid so I'm not unhappy. It's really nice compared to the other classes, but a bit like the Monks I'd say it's rehashed or reused content really, may as well be Darnassus with added wooden status. But it's familiar and comforting and nobody is going to complain about that. The one that pains me the most is of course the Rogues, they were well justified in complaining, it looks terrible and no amount of complaining is going to change it I'm sure. The Priest hall if you aren't into Draenei architecture is going to get on your nerves and I am not sold on the poor warlocks having no roof over their heads. All in all, final verdict, apart from the Warrior hall all of them are sadly quite predictable and uninteresting simply because they are such familiar structures. That can be both a good thing for those that like familiar and comforting areas or a bad thing if you yearn to see new things.</div></div><hr />

Minor graphical updates on the soulforges (much better, I admit, but not enough). Monks got the same. Small detail changes but overall more of the same. Every other one has something cool or unique about it without recycling a lot. Even the paladin hall that looks like it was based off SM or Strat still has a lot of depth and feels like a new and special place to interact with your class.</div></div><hr />
