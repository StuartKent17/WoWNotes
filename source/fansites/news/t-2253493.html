<br />
World of Warcraft esports is expanding into the fast-paced, highly competitive world of Mythic Keystone dungeons with the Mythic Dungeon Invitational. We’re looking for the best of the best from around the world to battle it out for a share of $100,000.<br />
<br />
Great Expectations, Great Rewards<br />
We’re looking for the best players in the world, but first you need to show us you have the right stuff to compete. Teams aspiring to battle on the global stage must first push themselves through a gauntlet of Mythic Keystone dungeons, taking on increasingly difficult Mythic Keystones and earning the best scores on the Proving Grounds.<br />
<br />
Top scoring contenders will be invited to join as one of 32 outstanding teams from around the world, competing for a share of the $100,000 prize pool—and ultimately claiming bragging rights of the #1 spot. Once chosen, 8 teams from the Americas, 8 from Europe, 8 from China, and 8 from Asia-Pacific will be tapped to face the challenge, proving they have what it takes to go all the way to the finals.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Proving Grounds [July 25–August 8]<br />
From July 25 to August 8 , teams aiming to secure an invitation to the top 32 will be challenged to push their way through Mythic Keystone dungeons to achieve their best scores. At the end of the two weeks, they’ll need to submit their top score using this form (https://mythicdungeoninvitational.wufoo.com/forms/m154hh9q1s6vx23/). Note that any entries received prior to the end of the Proving Grounds period (August 8) will not be considered.<br />
<br />
Remember, to be truly competitive among the World of Warcraft elite, your team must master multiple dungeons. We’ll be judging performance across the 5 dungeons in which the team achieves the highest Keystone Level during those two weeks.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Proving Grounds run from July 25–August 8<br />
Players will need to run a string of Mythic Keystone dungeons, increasing their Keystones Levels as high as they can. Performance will be evaluated across the five dungeons in which the team achieves the highest Keystone Level during those two weeks.<br />
No sign-ups required: all players are welcome to form up a five-player group and compete during the Proving Grounds period.<br />
At the end of the two-week Proving Grounds period, players will need to submit their top score [see blog for link]<br />
Based on scores from the Proving Grounds period, 32 teams will be invited to the playoffs: eight each from the Americas, Europe, China, and Asia-Pacific.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Big Showdown<br />
Beginning in September, the invited contenders will compete in the Mythic Keystone Dungeon Invitational for their share of the prize pool. Each region’s contenders will be a part of a single-day broadcast in which they will face a series of elimination rounds until just 2 are left standing to represent their region on the global stage.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Regional Playoffs will take place over two weekends, with each region having its own single-day broadcast streamed on the Warcraft Twitch channel:<br />
<br />
September 16: China<br />
September 17: Asia-Pacific<br />
September 23: Europe<br />
September 24: Americas<br />
<br />
In the head-to-head competition, teams will execute a dungeon speed run; the first to finish will be declared the winner. All Keystones and affixes will be determined by Blizzard at the start of the match.<br />
The top eight teams from the regions will face off in a single-elimination bracket, facing each opposing team in a best of three series, until just two are left standing to represent their region on the global stage.<br />
Global Bracket: The top eight teams from the Regional Playoffs will advance to the final weekend of competition taking place on September 30 and October 1.<br />
Teams will continue to compete in a head-to-head single elimination bracket, only this time the battles will be cross-region.<br />
The top eight teams will earn their share of the $100,000 (USD) prize pool, broken down as follows:<br />
<br />
1st – $50,000<br />
2nd – $20,000<br />
3rd &amp; 4th – $10,000<br />
5th – 8th – $2,500<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rules of Engagement<br />
<br />
Keystone levels and affixes will be determined by Blizzard<br />
The first match of each series will take place in a dungeon pre-determined by Blizzard.<br />
Once the final 8 regional teams have been determined, they’ll move on to a single-elimination bracket where they’ll go head-to-head.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

How is hosting a competitive tournament with predictable teams for PvE going to improve the game? Whut.</div></div><hr />

Maybe this means they'll eventually figure out a way to make the world first race more interesting and worthwhile.</div></div><hr />

Hmm... I thought this was about keystones? Fairly certain that whole system is kinda broken as well.<br />
<br />
Anyway, pointless competitive crap that will turn up some rather predictable results of fotm classes/combinations.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Fairly certain&quot; as in &quot;do you have any statistics and opinions&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
So how will they balance this?<br />
<br />
How do they need to? Here is a dungeon. Here are the Affixes...Go for it...try your best....whatever gear and party combination you can come up with?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not predictable teams at all. Go ahead and try, you'll probably get a few right. Maybe 2 or 3. There's 32 competing teams.<br />
<br />
It improves the game by expanding the competitive scene.<br />
<br />
WoW pvp is fairly hard to follow if you don't know anything about the game and the new casters aren't extremely good. Azael or whatever his name was from wrath/cata and even MoP was amazing. He spoke fast and kept people on the edge of their seat even if they had no idea what was going on. <br />
<br />
Regardless of that though, moving the competitive scene to pve will improve plenty of things. Cash flow, amount of players, etc. There's been a lot of people and guilds that dedicate themselves solely to mythic+ (plenty on my server). We'll absolutely be seeing a lot of players we don't know from the competitive pve scene take part.</div></div><hr />

Class, spec, legendary and tier sets massively influence mythic+. Not to mention which garbage bonus is currently active. Forming a competitive event around that is like inviting a 2m guy and a midget to duke it out in a broad jumping competition.</div></div><hr />

Oh..I think all that would make it interesting? And make it the opposite of a &quot;2m guy and a midget to duke it out in a broad jumping competition&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Man the esports thirst is unquenchable with the WoW team.<br />
<br />
Could be because it is possibly one of the &quot;next big things&quot; and they want to explore it? Or at least take a shot at it and not just give up.? 100k is also not crazy money for any company...so why not give it a go?</div></div><hr />

I can tell you with 100%, while I like Mythic+ a lot, you cannot run AI vs Players in an ESport Environment. This is going to be super cringy to watch, much like all of those E3 Presentations with Commentators for gameplay. It will just be wrong. Imagine if Method had commentators on their kill videos? Shit is boring and the main focus will inevitably turn to the poor soul (hopefully Lore) who will have to commentate the mundane BS.</div></div><hr />

the way i remember it people used to enjoy those live raids they used to do on blizzcon. if this can be in a similar vein, ideally with some fun showmatches of teams vs silly insane encounters the devs throw to together, i can see this catching on.</div></div><hr />

Personally I enjoyed the Hogger raid one. Never been a fan of the others. Subjective taste blah blah.</div></div><hr />

they wont so we will most probably be looking at people doin exackly same BiS comps doin exackly same pulls and only difference will be between somebody fucking up and not fucking up<br />

<br />
Think of it in terms of bicycle racing. PvP is a pursuit race, where the people involved are in direct competition with each other to win. It's all about putting pressure on the other person, and creating a dynamic situation in which you can create opportunities to win.<br />
<br />
A PvE race like this, however, is more like a team time trial. You are competing against other people, but it's not a direct competition. It's more about using your own power and technical skills to the best of your ability, without the interference of outside forces.<br />
<br />
Certainly people will probably like one more than the other and vice versa, but both have their own strengths and are fascinating to watch in their own way. Previously, we've never really gotten a chance to really see the effect of a longer term season of time trial-style events in eSports. It might be a wash, it's true. But there very well may be a place for shows of the kind of technical perfection that time trial events demand.</div></div><hr />

Well they've tried it with Arena, they didn't even bother trying it with the world first raiding scene (even back when people used to get super hyped over nothing) now it seems like they are just going to throw it at different aspects of the game just to see if it'll stick. Next we'll have Blizzard sponsored competitive leveling competitions and Transmog fashion shows as they try to see if that works after this will undoubtedly won't meet their expectations. <br />
<br />
I really don't get why they keep trying to turn WoW segments into Esports especially when the only other games that have actually been successful Esports-wise are Starcraft and Hearthstone. HotS and Overwatch just kinda flounder along in the water whilst they never did anything with the arena system in Diablo 3.</div></div><hr />

I believe this is a great approach!! For all of us that love pve! M+ is challenging and it is practically player vs player in the sense that u get to see how each grp approaches this simultsneously ( since 2 teams will compete at same time), so yeah! Sounds interesting!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1. But how do you make it fair if you don't enfore the same gear levels?<br />
<br />
It is fair, because everyone is facing the same challenge (including affixes). Think of it in terms of the olympics (pve), not in terms of the football world cup (pvp). The 100m dash isn't made shorter for you just because you have shorter legs than your competitor, but to limite the impact of the largest differences (age) you have different classes in all competitive team games (U21 etc.). Now you could say that fairness should also include fair training conditions, but that's unrealistic. For example, would you exclude unemployed players from the tournament because the have an unfair advantage in terms of their available preparation time? I don't think so.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. But I don't do mythic raiding, so mythic raiders have an advantage with their set gear.<br />
<br />
That's a more interesting argument. It's like saying that a Formula-1 champion with lots of money has an advantage over a Rallye driver because he can afford a better Rallye car. That only matters if both are equally skilled at Rallye driving, which is highly questionable. Anyone who's serious about their M+ game would support that you can't rely on Mythic raiders to push high keys just because they have the gear. Top 10 M+ runs involve memorizing every burst phase, interrupt, position, and, most importantly, the new mitigation strategies that become crucial at keystone levels most people will never see. That's a skillset most Mythic raiders think they have, but they don't. Hybris, however, is widespread.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, it would make a lot of sense to simply disable all tier set bonuses from raid gear for the purpose of this race to take away this imbalance entirely, as was said before. That Mythic gear starts at a higher ilvl becomes irrelevant if you chain-run M+ dungeons. The amount of drops combined with the chance to TF high easily outweighs the ilvl gap, but the set bonuses would still make a difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. But only FOTM comps will be able to compete.<br />
<br />
This is irrelevant for the players that this tournament is aimed at. The Top 10 players in any region have multiple alts. Remember, this is meant to identify the best in the world, and best means &quot;the people who are able to meet the requirements of the challenge in the best possible way&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
To be honest, I think we should take this event very seriously as a community for a bunch of reasons. <br />
<br />
Since it's the first of its kind, there's a lot to learn from it. If it gets enough attention there's a chance that it will become a seasonal thing, which would be really good for the competitive scene. I'll never understand how you can be against something that makes someone else better if it doesn't make yourself worse off.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if we start to see FOTM comps as well as identical strats this might induce balancing tweaks around specs, but also around the instances, which is good for everyone. Anything in the game can be changed and a competition like this would help to identify problems that need fixing. <br />
<br />
You could also iteratively tweak it and make it more interesting, because it's essentially one large speedrun competition (hi AGDQ). One idea could be to turn it into a charity marathon as well, there's no shame in copying a good thing. Have a certain percentage of the donations go to the runners (which could lead to some quite substantial incentives), a certain percentage go to the organizers (Blizzard, because they could leverage this quickly), and the rest of it to something people feel good donating for. Make the runs interesting by interviewing players who explain what the different classes are doing (imagine someone talking about the extended Firestarter Mage opener while the guy is doing it, or giving tips what to pull and why), so that the viewers would learn something. <br />
<br />
I'll definitely follow this if only to learn new strats about the different dungeons. It's a cool thing and should be supported.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what you mean by big portion, are you just talking about flat numbers or percentages? Cuz the percentage of people enjoying pvp more than pve is very low atm.<br />

Blizzard made a significant investment in eSports, expect to see this for every title. It's really not surprising this happened.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tier539</div><div class="date">2017-07-12, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since this is the first event and it will surely have considerable hype around it, I'm hoping they focus more on the viewing experience of the tourney over balancing every single detail. It could be a perfectly balanced event, but if they don't have great production quality or they bring in poor casters, we won't see this event take off in the future. I also hope they invite some players/teams that already have relevance within the community to the tourney. I'm probably being an asshole, but I don't want to watch a tourney full of players I've never heard of before, even if they are the best. ESports (and sports and general) are most enjoyable when you can root for a player (or team) to win. I'll be very disappointed if I find myself struggling to find a team I want to win because the tourney is full of completely unknown people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
id imagine it will just highlight which classes are clearly better than others at M+ and someone will get money, but in terms of entertainment i see nothing.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but I'm not too impressed, and don't think this'll go very far. Some classes are just garbage for this, and even more so it may be predictable. Had they done this sooner, perhaps it'd be cool. But now it's a bit too late for it.</div></div><hr />

I think all of you are gonna be surprised about some classes and strategies in certain dungeons. But this is for people that love M+ alot of people here arent Into WoWs end game content</div></div><hr />

<br />
And they tried to make a lot of games to enter the scene. Starcraft 2 was their best shot, but fucked that up in the end. Overwatch is just sad and even looks like shit, even though a lot of impressive designers left wow for it. <br />
<br />
On topic though, I will definitely watch some m+ competition. Hoping it will be a nice watch</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Logwyn</div><div class="date">2017-07-13, 04:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just never saw the point of running Mythic+ I've done like 3 maybe. All the gear I've gotten is world quests, raids, LFR, and crafting. It works fine for me. Then again I don't push Mythic raids with the guild. Don't see the point in these either. Maybe its just me. <br />
<br />
These esports for Mythic seem just for some elite Blizzard circle. Where was the sign ups to get into the tourney? The try-outs? Guess we have to support the Clique?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isnt esports. Its a GDQ speed run, with the fastest winning a prize. It might be interesting but its defenetly not esports.</div></div><hr />

too bad that everything that blizzard touches in regards to esport is ruined</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because there is no price to it. Therefore, people play with friends. As soon as there is a price on it, people play with the best possible setup. There might be a few teams in that have other combos, but I bet you that the last 8 teams will all have a very very similar setup that consists of at least 1 Demon Hunter and 1 Heal Drood.</div></div><hr />

Well in MoP, Holinka released numbers of it. He basically compared the activity levels of arena games with normal raiding and RBGs with mythic raiding, again, activity wise. It's been years since I've read it though, and obviously a lot can happen over the span of 2 expansions.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that they should focus more on the PvP eSports, the arena/RBG scene would grow naturally if only they didn't fuck PvP players at every opportunity presented to them.</div></div><hr />

But doesnt Hpala do way more burst damage than Rdruids? You talk as if you know what the only classes work in M+ when in reality it depends on the dungeon and affixes including tyra/fort where one is generally ST focused and the other AOE. Why bring DH when Arms and Frost Mages are miles better on longer ST fights? It isnt as black and white as you may think.<br />
<br />
Also there are strategies on some instances that most people dont know about (like the first beacon in the beginning of CoS). The things that i wanna know though is how gear is gonna affect this and what key levels we are running. Big difference between a +10 and a +20</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traxwow</div><div class="date">2017-07-15, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">...maybe PvP would get more views if they fixed it kek<br />
<br />
The only way they could &quot;fix&quot; pvp in a way that would attract a greater audience would be to gut all the classes to the most basic level. Nobody scrolling along twitch wants to watch a game that has a class with 5 different CC's which don't have clear visuals when combined with aoe abilities being spammed everywhere and a camera angle that can move in a direction you aren't facing. Better balancing and certain gameplay changes might make the game more enjoyable to the current pvp player base, but will do nothing for exposure.</div></div><hr />
