We added screenshots to some of the zones pages. We'll probably update some articles this week, don't be surprised if some of them look strange at some point, it won't last more than a few minutes.  
 
Gun'drak (Article) 
A lot of effects were added, boss rooms labeled and it definitely looks great now.

Mana cost change to prevent Downranking<br />
Remember that we're looking for constructive feedback. And please keep in mind that as we've stated, we're going to look at any issues this changes creates and will be working to resolve them. This may include the addition of new spells or abilities or possibly re-working existing unused abilities.

Utgarde Keep - Ingvar the Plunderer Phase 2<br />
We're still looking into what causes Ingvar's transition to phase 2 to halt for some players, but haven't been able to identify the precise reason this happens yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/8765696223-813-patch-feedback-utgarde-keep-7072.html))<br />

Feral Tanking in WotLK<br />
Nobody can really compare a level 80 prot warrior to a level 80 feral druid because those individuals don't exist yet. Therefore, we have made almost no attempt to compare their tanking stats except to say &quot;Man, bears could probably use something like Last Stand and something like Thunder Clap&quot; and &quot;Hey, let's make sure bears don't have to scrounge for rare +defense leather or even +resilience in order to be uncrittable.&quot; That work is coming.<br />
<br />
Bears are able to tank some end-game content even on Live, so I don't think they are orders of magnitude behind warriors. In situations where they struggle, it is sometimes because of crushing blows or mechanics introduced specifically to drive warriors to tank, Shear for instance. I'm going to be tanking Ulduar on my bear, so I'll be the first to complain if I feel the class design isn't up to it.<br />
<br />
As far as the previous poster who likes the Feral as the tank / dps hybrid, I don't think anything we're doing will really hurt that. You may be 5-10 talent points behind a tank-focused Feral or a dps-focused Feral but if you liked OTing the bear boss in ZA and then dps'ing on the eagle boss, you should still be great at doing that. The difference is the bear who does spend those talents on threat, mitigation and oh snap abilities instead of +Shred can actually be a raid's primary main tank.<br />
<br />
One of the best rogues I know occasionally raided in blue gear or with no talent spec just to remind everyone that player skill often has a much bigger impact on your contribution to a raid than anything else. I know it's easy for anyone to drag out antecdotes that nobody else can validate, but it's worth keeping in mind.<br />
<br />
Now I am imagining the &quot;GC said you don't need talents or gear to tank, so obviously X class isn't going to get any!&quot; quotes. 1) Not true. 2) Sigh. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/8537784293-feral-concerns-in-wotlk.html))<br />

Overpower in PvE<br />
I can't recall if I mentioned this, but one thing that comes up a lot is letting Arms get better use out of Overpower in PvE. No promises, but I wouldn't at all be surprised to see something like this. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/8765745935-ghost-any-word-on-dps-specs.html))<br />

Tanking multiple targets in WotLK<br />
Shockwave is a cool ability, but if it is the ultimate AE tanking ability, that isn't really going to let dps warriors tank Utgarde. I also know plenty of warriors and bears that can get a large pull to stick them like glue even today. But it takes a lot of tab-targeting and a lot of skill. Skill is always going to be a component of tanking, but since you can't always gauge the skill of someone you don't know, we'd rather give everyone good tools to tank a 5-player run.

Bloodworms Healing<br />
The Bloodworms should heal you for 150% of the damage they do. If they hit for 30, they should heal you for 45. There were some bugs with the calculation until recently. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/9023605409-fix-the-bloodworm-healing.html))<br />

Death Knight Auras in Buff Bar<br />
We turned the aura icons off. Once you get the talent, that aura will be up all the time so we thought it was annoying to have the icon always there reminding you. Most passive talents aren't shown as icons. It shows up for the other players in your group, however, to remind them.

Black Ice<br />
Black Ice says it affects &quot;spells&quot; but I believe the way it is set up is just to improve Frost and Shadow damage. I'm not sure if anyone has tested that or not. Changing that tooltip could have a big effect on Frost and Unholy.</div></div><hr />

actually bear should just be able to wear a shield. Actually no, make them the first user to be able to &quot;dual wield shield&quot; (you know, one for each side). With 7k armor per shield multiplied by 5, that be enough I think. Barely but it'd be a nice start. <br />

I totally agree with the skill aspect here, by no means do I proclaim to be a tanking god (I actually don't play my warrior much any more) but I never had any problems tanking on my warrior even in the bastard of an instance that is heroic SH. Pretty pathetic really that the solution is just to give everyone spammable aoe threat instead of everyone learning to play better.</div></div><hr />

What might be interesting to note is that black and blue have permanent structures to substance a portal, while the rest are being created. Of course blue would have one (while its still being opened) since they live there, but does that mean Deathwing has been in northrend this entire time?<br />
<br />
The visuals are quite compelling, I can't wait to see the encounters blizzard has made, I'm sure Malygoes will be awesome (wtf your floating on space?) and places like Ahn'Kahet look great.</div></div><hr />

naw, if they give us parry they'd lower our dodge from agi, since we're balanced around what we have. if they gave us parry we'd have to worry about 2 stats for avoidance, and have to stack either parry rating or defense to get both parry and dodge, when now we can just stack agi which is a much better option for us.</div></div><hr />

Rogues are not OP, they are powerful in there niche, but not op<br />
<br />
I find it funny how those that are screaming that rogues are op dont play rogues. I have a hunter(70), warlock(70) and a 70 rogue(77 on beta). Everyone of these classes has a benefit, and take certain skill sets to play. Learn to play your individual class, and any class can become OP, its the driver not the car that is fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Completely agree with you and Wraithedge, his example is ludicrous.<br />
Setting aside energy regen talents and extra combo points for the moment...<br />
a fairly standard combat rogue would lose at least:<br />
5% crit<br />
30% damage increase to crit bonuses on many bread and butter abilities<br />
Damage increasers by 2%, 6% and 10% (from different talents) = GONE<br />
5% chance to hit reduction (HUGE nerf right there)<br />
10 expertise rating = GONE<br />
Off hand damage increase of 50% = GONE<br />
<br />
and I'm supposed to believe that his &quot;skill&quot; somehow makes up for these losses in dps? Really? Because a dps rotation is so difficult to play?<br />
The loss in combo point additions and energy regen from crits alone would knock any rogue down many dps slots.<br />
<br />
Oh! Maybe the rogue would be able to compete due to not having to even think about his threat!<br />
Feignt? Who needs feignt with dps this shitty!<br />
And all that dps time saved by not having to use vanish during a boss fight!<br />
/rollseyes<br />
<br />
Whenever I see dev posts like this, I'm more and more convinced that they don't even play the game.<br />
The fact that he can't validate his example (WWS? SS or it didn't happen?) is the icing on his bullshit cake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already lowered dodge from agil, didn't they? Plus, SotF could have an addition that converts agility into parry rating. That would keep with Druids stacking agility rather than this suggestion of Druids stacking stamina for huge health pools with no real hints of other mitigation.</div></div><hr />
