Ragnaros 25-Man Heroic World 2nd Kill by Method<br />
A few hours ago, Method (http://www.methodwow.com/) became the second guild in the world to defeat Ragnaros in 25-Man Heroic mode! Congratulations to them! It also means that we'll eventually get a nice video from Paragon in a few hours. <br />

Battle.net Authenticator Changes<br />
We understand the concern many players have with the recent Battle.net authenticator changes. To that end, we’re exploring the idea of adding an “Opt Out” option within Battle.net Account Management, which would then force the prompt for an authenticator code whenever you log into World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
To be clear, we have gone to great lengths to ensure Battle.net accounts and authenticators provide players with a high level of security. Maintaining a safe and secure Blizzard gameplay environment remains a top priority for us. <br />
<br />
[...] We've been discussing the best way to implement new options for this feature since the moment it was announced. We don't yet have additional details about exactly how we might implement the feature, or whether it's something you'll need to opt out of by default, or opt into by default. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/187761/about-the-recent-authenticator-change) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2878770591?page=9#167))<br />
<br />
Very Rare Drop Mounts<br />
You'll likely always see a variety of ways to obtain mounts in the game. We don't necessarily implement all of them in a way that ensures we acquiesce all mount collectors or achievement hounds.<br />
<br />
We want a healthy number of mounts to remain fairly rare in the game, and sometimes that involves making them huge luck finds in dungeons or raids. For the average player, there will always be plenty of new mounts to acquire or work toward, but we also want to have a decent variety of coveted mounts that only a lucky handful of players will find.<br />
<br />
Players often express concern that they end up looking like everyone else when they acquire awesome gear. This was somewhat a flip from the concept that tier sets were much too difficult to obtain back in the day. We share this concern and also think it's a problem that would apply to mounts as well, if some of the more rare ones out there had their RNG components removed.<br />
<br />
There are so many mounts in the game now that having some really rare and random prestige rides is okay by us. ;) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/187788/can-we-stop-with-the-drop-mounts) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2878492092?page=3#59))<br />

I guess Paragon has been found to have used Saronite bombs to return the boss to phase 1, thus making Method's the first kill? Or... maybe not?</div></div><hr />

Every person with even half a clue told them that there is NO point to having a security function that can be bypassed. <br />
And here is obvious that you have none since you can't even understand the difference of simple things.<br />
<br />
<br />
You had to be a complete and total moron to not see that bypassing an authenticator FOR ANY REASON defeats the purpose of even HAVING an authenticator.<br />
<br />
How stupid are the developers who work at this company now? It took 13 pages of threads and weeks of people yelling for them to finally grasp a basic fact?<br />
<br />
And then they do...do they admit &quot;yeah we realize now we fell for the classic trap of trading convenience for security, our bad, we'll roll the system back to where it was&quot;?<br />
<br />
No. They act like &quot;OH NO, our system is still totally better and you should not take the fact we are allowing an opt-out as anything other than us adding a new feature to this fancantrabulous system of ours!&quot;<br />
<br />
What a load of shit. Not only incompetent, but too vain to even admit they screwed up and need to go back to the system someone OBVIOUSLY smarter than the current batch of developers designed.<br />
<br />
Harsh language for people who actually developing a large scale projects from who? <br />

I won't bother too much but i'll just redirect you to this great video totally resembling your quality of your post http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfYJsQAhl0</div></div><hr />

I travel a lot and when I go to another person's house or another country I'll always be asked for my authenticator, but if I'm just logging in from home it's nice to not have to use it every single time. I think it's still perfectly secure if you don't have it prompting you for your authenticator code every time. If somebody from China or Germany was trying to log in to your account they'd get asked for the code, but you won't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all, the point of an authenticator is to stop unauthorised people gaining access to your account, nothing more, nothing less.<br />
<br />
What you are suggesting is that no one has ever given anyone else their authenticator code to login for a family member or friend.<br />
<br />
There's also the option in the battle.net config pages to take an authenticator off of an account, you're suggesting that people who take it off for a friend to login, then put it back on when the friend is done playing are also defeating the purpose of having an authenticator, which is not true because the purpose of the authenticator is still the same.<br />
<br />
Someone with even basic knowledge of IP networking and auth systems you would be aware of the changes they made and why they made them... and why getting upset about them is really quite silly.<br />
<br />
tldr: you don't know what you're talking about so don't act like you do.</div></div><hr />

The security breaches are limited and only apply to a small amount of players - domestic issues (annoying brothers) or people who decide that logging in from public pcs is a good idea. Yes, I realize there's a complicated hack to bypass the authenticator, but then again, a hack like that already existed. If someone really wants your account, they'll get it, auth or not. All in all I personally welcome the change.</div></div><hr />
