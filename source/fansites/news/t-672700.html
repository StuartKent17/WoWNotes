New Character Bios: Jaina and Sylvanas<br />
Countless heroes and villains have played a part in the ever-changing tableau of Azeroth’s history. In the upcoming World of Warcraft content patch, two will step forward to confront the Lich King Arthas -- one a former friend, the other a former servant -- in the Icecrown Citadel: The Frozen Halls dungeon.<br />
<br />
Learn more about Jaina Proudmoore of the Alliance and Sylvanas Windrunner, Banshee Queen of the Forsaken, on our new bio page. http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/3p3/characters.xml<br />

Character and Creature Nameplates<br />
We have made some changes to the way creature and character nameplates display in the game and would like to get feedback from those of you on the public test realms. There are three significant changes you should notice:<br />
<br />
The range at which you can see the nameplates is now much longer.<br />
You can no longer see the nameplates through objects which block line of sight.<br />
Instead of the nameplates trying to sort themselves, they just overlap. We think this makes them more useful for very large groups (example: Onyxia whelps).<br />
<br />
Please let us know how this change affects your play experience, whether through PvE or PvP.<br />
<br />
For clarification, please also refer to my follow-up post about nameplate changes:<br />
<br />
We have a couple of points of clarification based on some of the feedback and concerns we’ve been seeing in this thread:<br />
<br />
As long as you are able to peer into the doorway of a room, you will see nameplates of players or creatures in that room.<br />
Similar to the first point, pillars and bridges in Arenas will not hide friendly or enemy nameplates.<br />
Nameplates for totems can be toggled under “PRODUCTION” settings in “Interface Options” on the test realms. We will look into adding this functionality for pets as well.<br />
The way nameplates are sorted when large numbers of creatures and players are grouped together is not fully functional and we will continue to address the way these are sorted and displayed throughout the testing process. In the mean time, you can choose to toggle this feature back to its original functionality, also under &quot;PRODUCTION&quot; settings.<br />
<br />

Pets scaling in Patch 3.3<br />
We're still working on it. One stat that will almost certainly not get scaled to the pet is armor pen. It is technically (for obscure reasons) challenging to convert the armor pen rating from the hunter to the pet. Given armor pen's not so rosy future (as a stat on gear anyway), this one probably won't get resolved.<br />
<br />
We'd still like to scale haste, crit and just about everything else. We'll get done what we can. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20136603051-pets-scaling-and-33.html))<br />
<br />
New Nameplates and Arena Pillars<br />
It's not as simple as just LOS. The way the game handles LOS is a little more complicated than that. We'll try and get the thread updated, but Arena pillars should not prevent nameplates. Dungeon walls typically will. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20442614321-nameplates-no-longer-viewable-out-of-los.html))<br />
<br />

Scourge Strike and Unholy Blight in 3.3<br />
Scourge Strike doesn't work like Necrosis. There is no need to draw inferences from one to the other. If Scourge Strike benefits from EP and Black Ice on live, then the Shadow portion of it will in 3.3.<br />
<br />
All we did was change part of the attack to physical damage, which lets us increase the amount that it hits for overall. This means it should do more damage against lightly armored or fully sundered targets but less damage against heavily armored targets (assuming no armor pen). Magic attacks (even melee weapon swings) typically hit for less since they ignore armor. Switching some of the damage to physical let us inflate the number.<br />
<br />
Our goals were to make armor pen slightly more valuable to Unholy DKs and just make Scourge Strike and Reaping valuable to Unholy DKs. I understand many of you just wanted us to boost the numbers because you wanted for it to hit more, but under the way we balance it isn't fair for a magical attack to hit for as much as a physical attack.<br />
<br />
The nerf to Unholy Blight was in part because we think SS will be contributing to more damage overall. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20143783373-new-scourge-strike.html))</div></div><hr />

Wow, this will have a serious amount of impact on LoSing in PvP.<br />

Tought about the name plates:<br />
<br />
I really think that for dpsers and healers ll not really make a diference since i really understand why blizzard wants to change it..<br />
<br />
But lets imagin a fight where there are not 50 whelps or so like in onyxia and there are 20 whelps, 20 snakes (per example) and 2 elites... <br />
I as a tankadin normally use the nameplates to select the one I wanna do more agroo, if they overlap themselfs that would make it complicated for me..<br />
<br />
I do still understand the point and its not a bad idea... but could it be possible to have it both ways? in a interface option per example?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good change. Though I would've preferred something in the 3D world instead of a 2D overlay. <br />
<br />
There was a game that did this, but I don't remember which. It had health rings at the base of a things. And the ring would deplete and change colors based on health. Would really make healing more easier. Especially now that all healing classes have AOE heals, its hard to tell if your spell will hit enough targets to make it worth it (though pally AOE heal is &quot;free&quot;). You could spot a cluster of red/orange health rings and hit your AOE in the middle of them.</div></div><hr />

2P: how can you say its finaly good change if it doesnt say how long is &quot;..for until cancelled&quot;..<br />
- does it mean &quot;until ded&quot; then its awesome<br />
- does it mean &quot;until expires&quot; then its still unknown how long time, maybe if its 5 secs? ???<br />
4P: using serpent sting which tick every 3 secs with 5% chance to proc..<br />
- if it has no internal cd is it good to have 10% AP increase 16% of time? definitely! with 2min internal cd its not that bright and shiny anymore but still good..<br />
- now another question - will it buff over call of the wild and trinkets if I pop em when this has procced? ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
And good rogues will continue to Tricks throughout the fight, generally switching to a top DPSer once threat is established or to help tanks with add aggro.<br />

On one hand I am happy I can get my energy generating bonus at 2 pieces from the rogue-set now. On the other, pushing the second bonus to 4 parts makes 13% chance feel a little low for a near completed set.<br />
I'd accept 2 combo points at 20/25% too or something instead of 3 for 13%.</div></div><hr />

the 2 piece bonus is nice, but not usefull in all situations :-/<br />

<br />
Good change. Though I would've preferred something in the 3D world instead of a 2D overlay. <br />
<br />
There was a game that did this, but I don't remember which. It had health rings at the base of a things. And the ring would deplete and change colors based on health. Would really make healing more easier. Especially now that all healing classes have AOE heals, its hard to tell if your spell will hit enough targets to make it worth it (though pally AOE heal is &quot;free&quot;). You could spot a cluster of red/orange health rings and hit your AOE in the middle of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Witcher&quot; does this.<br />
<br />
I personally would like to see some sort of tracker (like EVE's radar) that groups up the targets which would have various settings for sorting them. If I could write addons, I'd give it a try, but alas :(</div></div><hr />

I'm not gonna argue with the warrior math part, but unless I'm mistaken, Shamanistic Rage as a 1 min CD right? So 25% uptime, and 25% of 12 is 3. So That's a 3% dps increase. I'm sure all the final numbers should work out to be about the same, don't forget it's the PTR and likely to be some tweaks.<br />
<br />
Also something to think about. Classes/specs scale differently so giving a 3% bonus to Enhance and a 2% to warriors might make up the difference in scaling. I'm glad to see mages finally got a haste bonus. Overall everything looks really good.</div></div><hr />

You have to keep it in mind that for PvE Divine storm is a pretty shite dps ability. It comes 4th(3rd skipping HoW) out of 6(5) abilities paladin uses. This might be a bit interesting, if simulations with the bonus will make DS better to get on CD asap to hope for a procc or not, else GCDs are pretty filled most the time so this bonus might in the end just sub a DS in, instead of exo or cons rather than being an extra ability.<br />

Dude - I think you're the ONLY balance druid that DOESN'T have OOC! Pretty much every druid spec picks it up, it is one of the best mana returning talents we have, and it only costs ONE talent point!<br />

You are very wrong, this bonus is AMAZING - Rend is always up 100% of the time on your current target and sometimes on secondary targets as well. That means it will tick at least 20 times/minute. Deep wounds ticks once per second for 6 seconds and has very close to 100% uptime, that's 60 ticks/minute - but let's be conservative here and say 40/min. <br />
<br />
(20+40)/60 secs = 1 tick/sec. 2% chance to proc on each tick means this will have ~1.2PPM for 10 sec duration means this buff will be up 20% of the time (assuming no ICD). This setbonus is roughly on par with the mirror of truth proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is that a QQ'ing?<br />
All I am saying is that blizzard first introduces something good, and then changes to something completely different. It is like black and white which pisses me off. I mean yeah 20% AP with 100% uptime maybe a little too much but hell 2% chance to get 20% AP for 10s is maybe as good as T8 2pc bonus - 150 hate ( absolute crap )<br />
As for T8 it's fine, because that is not the end game tier, but from T10 you would expect something more powerfull than that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bonus is as good for any spec. It will take you 6 seconds to dump all your runes the first time. After those 6 seconds you should be putting your runes on cooldown the instant they come back up, refreshing the buff, meaning the uptime should be near 100%. (You don't have to use all 6 runes again for them to all to be on cooldown again. They will all be on cooldown again the instant you use the first rune to refresh, even if there is only one second left on the next rune.)<br />
<br />
As for people not understanding the Heart Strike change... Obliterate (and probably SS once it works properly on the PTR) do somewhere between 25-30% of your damage. Death Strike is not used as often in the blood rotation, and only results in 10-13% of your damage. This made the bonus considerably worse for blood DKs.<br />
<br />
Heart Strike, however, also does roughly 30% of your damage in blood. There's some speculation that the only 7% bonus is due to HS's cleave effect or maybe that it does just a little more damage than the other two -- maybe even a combo of both. We'll see how it plays out in the PTR.</div></div><hr />

yeah, for Fury it's a bit lackluster, but I still think the 2% proc rate is deceptive. <br />

<br />
You dodge melee attacks yeah but normally the tank killing abilities are unavoidable.(Old Plasma blast, Fusion Punch on hm, big bang etc.) So Damage reduction is better outside of a surviving an enrage for a little while longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
What he said. The other classes will have one more thing to pop when they are about to get hit by a tank killer, which are the most important hits to recover from. Not to mention Bloodrage being outside global cooldown while Divine Plea isn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Priest<br />
<br />
* 2 piece bonus - Your Flash Heal critical strikes cause the target to heal for 25% of the healed amount over 9 sec.<br />
* 4 piece bonus - Your Circle of Healing and Penance spells have a 20% chance to cause your next Flash Heal cast within 6 sec to reset the cooldown on your Circle of Healing and Penance spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
* 2 piece bonus - While your Divine Illumination talent is active, your healing spells are increased by 35%.<br />
* 4 piece bonus - Your Holy Shock spell causes the next Holy Light you cast within 10 sec to have 0.3 sec reduced cast time. <br />

Set bonuses had changed slightly; and will probably change a few times more before 3.3 releases.<br />
There will likely be an ICD for 2-piece T10; like there is an ICD for the T8 2-piece.<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
2 piece bonus - When your Deep Wounds ability deals damage you have a 3% chance to gain 20% attack power for 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
4 piece bonus - You have a 30% chance for your Bloodsurge and Sudden Death talents to grant 2 charges of their effect instead of 1, reduce the global cooldown on Execute or Slam by 0.5 seconds, and for the duration of the effect to be increased by 100%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this stays, that would make the usual combo I do to regen mana (Wings + Divine Illumination + Divine Plea) essentially cancel out the healing deduction of Divine Plea. This is SO much better than 1 minute off our Divine Favor cd.</div></div><hr />

T8 was a fluke, critting ruptures should have easily been a glyph.<br />

T9 is a joke, 5% more crit 50% of the time is immeasurably useless.<br />

5.<br />

Every other class has at least one of their bonuses that occurs with a 30% or greater probability.<br />

Actually...you might think so, but warriors have even lower rng then that:<br />

Mm explain the logic behind this.. you take this point because you are raiding?? or did you take this because this is build on a knowledge /confused.. <br />

Dude - I think you're the ONLY balance druid that DOESN'T have OOC! Pretty much every druid spec picks it up, it is one of the best mana returning talents we have, and it only costs ONE talent point!<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know about others but i find this one point useless.. I never ever go out of mana.. that is since Tier 7 that is.. Since bliz changed the mana regen etc. on Tier7 and higher it isn't that much of a problem anymore. If the mana is the main to pick this one up i'm not a pro for that.. BUT if bliz will give this 1 point some extra pewpew i will consider it.. Still it is way way down in the tree in my opnion. ;)</div></div><hr />

But, when initiating an attack we always TotT our friendly players, leaving us with either 85 or 95 energi depending on spec... How the hell will the 2p bonus help while starting a fight? And while fighting and TotT your mates, 15 energi aint shit because a good rogue knows when to energi pool. Meaning that the lacking energi from TotT isnt even a problem. And when having energi problems you could always use Thistle Tea. Not to mention Combat Potency.<br />
<br />
Now the 4p bonus... 13% is good, but that should of been the 2p bonus.<br />
<br />
People saying the t10 looks awsome are lying to themselfs! The set looks HORRIBLE not to mention the 2p bonus.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, why oh why do you always have to nerf us rogues?! But making other classes op?!<br />
<br />
I skipped the t9 and still rock my t8.5 (even do I lack 1 piece...) Will I have to do the same with the t10? I mean wtf is wrong with u Blizzard?! And the modeling artists, were they smoking that potent *!!* while making the tier sets?!<br />
<br />
I am deeply pissed off, I love my rogue even though every chance u get, u nerf us.<br />
<br />
Dont even get me started on paladins... First you make em op, then u &quot;nerf&quot; em, now u will make em op again? And you talk about balance?! I say stop supplying your workers with what ever *!!* they are taking!<br />
<br />
I've never ranted away before, but now I'm pissed off! And to the &quot;fake ass wannabe rogues&quot; out there! Dont lie to yourselfs, the upcoming t10 looks like *!!* and will be *!!* except for the 4p bonus that should be the 2p bonus instead!<br />
<br />
I never say anything, but now Blizzard, you have made my WoW experience miserable. Cause no, I'm not a pro player, I'm not in a pro guild (even though I love the one I'm in), and I dont have the luxery to do TotC25 HC and get ilvl 258. Best I can get atm is ilvl245... I dont have imba items and cant fill my self with arp cause of your stupid mistakes! But I have a *!!* loads of Emblem of Triumph just laying there cause again the t9 is *!!*! I rather wait for the last piece of t8.5 and do mediocre dps even though I know I can do much more only if you smartasses would have &quot;balanced&quot; the game in a PROPER way!<br />
<br />
Thanks you very much Blizzard, even though I am a paying costumer. Nerf us rogues even more in the future. I can only wonder what future plans you have for us rogues coming Catalysm.<br />

Quit the game if it pisses you off that much or otherwise draw up what you would WANT a tier set to look like and send it to blizzard if your so damn smart and such a baby about &quot;OMFG UGLY TIER&quot; and see if blizzard would say &quot;BRO NICE THATS GOING TO BE THE NEW TIER DEISGN&quot;, other then that QQ moar it doesnt get you no where imo; just take what they got... its refreshing that blizzard has put more of an attempt into T10 then uber bad T9.</div></div><hr />
