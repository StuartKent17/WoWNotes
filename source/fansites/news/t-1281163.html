At that time, Mogu were not flesh but stone, just like the statues they animate. Apparently at some point The Master went reallyyyyyyyyy quiet, and the Mogu succombed to the Curse of Flesh, just like dwarves and gnomes. But instead of being a slow process like for dwarves and Gnomes, it happened suddenly, and it leaded to huges inter-Mogu wars between clans, because no one knew how to deal with this.<br />
<br />
Lei Shen seem to have gone at the Nalak'sha Engine (and then became the First Emperor of the Mogu) at that time. This is also why they aren't any female Mogu, apart from the 2 creatons Lei Shen gave to himself. There's no need for them since the Mogu were created from scratch.<br />
<br />
All this to say that, obviously, &quot;The Master&quot; must be a Titan and the Mogu his creations, thus explaining why the Mogu have so many Titan intel in the Throne of Thunder, why they were able to harness the power of the Nalak'sha Engine in the first place and why Lei Shen managed to capture Ra-Den. So actually the &quot;MoguTitan&quot; pic make alot of sense, maybe it's the Titan who modeled the Mogu after his image, or maybe it's a Ra-Den like guardian put in place.</div></div><hr />

Funny thing is, I almost bet that if mount collecting was something only the 1% of raiders or arena did, the 150 and 200 mark might have actually been something amazing. Can't give the average player anything nice can they?</div></div><hr />

With the talent changes in MoP the impact of tri-spec for at least myself is far smaller than it would be now. At one point it is so little of a difference that it would not mater ether way and in another it does not really mater that why not implement it. Before I could of had various specs for one type of spec like resto depending on a fight or PVE vs PVP. Now mostly it comes down to convenience which is mostly covered already by an add-on for buttons and a quick swap of talents that takes almost not time at all. The duel-spec system might have not come out to begin with if we had this current talent system in place before hand.<br />
<br />
Personally I just do not see what the big fuss is over the need for a tri-spec system and at which point why not a quad spec system for druids. Maybe it is being an old timer that sees things like respecing to be such a trivial and non-humbug task. Thank again CC is something that is trivial to myself and yet it seems to be such a big pain for the new aged gamers that cant handle pushing an extra button and socializing with other people in an MMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
errrr what? how many dragonhawks?<br />
<br />
there are currently only 4 dragonhawk mounts. <br />
<br />
1 is TCG and unavailable for the vast majority of players. 1 belongs to the other faction and 1 is horde specific from the sunreavers in the Wotlk Tourny event (alliance get a neat hippogryph)<br />
<br />
You might as well be whining about how many water mounts blizz is throwing us<br />
<br />

i quite like the dragonhawks, if they were creating a new model people would be bitching about why they were different and why blizz cant be consistent with their creatures (like people did with the sandstone and &quot;of the wind&quot; drakes in cata that were quite different from the usual drakes).<br />
<br />
the different skins are quite nice.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard needs to realize that by the time you have 200 mounts, you have a lot of shit that's way cooler than this. <br />
<br />
<br />
This. +1<br />
<br />
If you are colecting mounts , when you have 200 , you will have some very rare and beautifull mounts. <br />
<br />
And why would you use an 5 years old lazy ugly reskin ? <br />
Those 2 dragonhawks are simply useless . <br />
Basically they won't be used by the mount collectors. <br />
<br />
Blizzard should stop being lazy and actually do a mount these people will use instead one they 100% won't use.<br />
<br />
I see no reason to put in the game a mount very rare and pretty ugly. <br />
1% will get it , and 1% of those will use it. Wasted development time .<br />
<br />
Blizzard, remember , the people colecting mounts are those that care the most about mounts in your game. And is not a nice thing to just throw them something , anything, without caring.</div></div><hr />

&quot;SteelWarhorseMount&quot; sounds for me like exclusive blacksmithing mount. BS needs some love. :cool:</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mingarrubia</div><div class="date">2013-03-29, 11:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About the &quot;Mogu Titan&quot; - don't forget the lore available on Isle of thunder : Before Lei Shen and any other emperor, the Mogu were obeying to someone called &quot;the Master&quot;. At that time, Mogu were not flesh but stone, just like the statues they animate. Apparently at some point The Master went reallyyyyyyyyy quiet, and the Mogu succombed to the Curse of Flesh, just like dwarves and gnomes. But instead of being a slow process like for dwarves and Gnomes, it happened suddenly, and it leaded to huges inter-Mogu wars between clans, because no one knew how to deal with this.<br />
<br />
Lei Shen seem to have gone at the Nalak'sha Engine (and then became the First Emperor of the Mogu) at that time. This is also why they aren't any female Mogu, apart from the 2 creatons Lei Shen gave to himself. There's no need for them since the Mogu were created from scratch.<br />
<br />
All this to say that, obviously, &quot;The Master&quot; must be a Titan and the Mogu his creations, thus explaining why the Mogu have so many Titan intel in the Throne of Thunder, why they were able to harness the power of the Nalak'sha Engine in the first place and why Lei Shen managed to capture Ra-Den. So actually the &quot;MoguTitan&quot; pic make alot of sense, maybe it's the Titan who modeled the Mogu after his image, or maybe it's a Ra-Den like guardian put in place.<br />
<br />
Interesting theory. Just to elaborate further on it: if you look carefully enough, you can see the face of this &quot;mogu titan&quot; between the clouds depicted in Throne of Thunder's loading screen.</div></div><hr />

Blacksmithing mount sounds good! 'bout time we got something fancy, indeed, even though I'm not crazy about its looks.</div></div><hr />

I have a lot of rare mounts and will definitely be riding this over them for quite a while after I get it the day patch drops. Both are nice, but I'm glad I am Alliance since that is my preferred skin of the two. Lots of fun new things coming with patch, disappointed that tri-spec might not make the cut :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wha...? No, that's Lei Shen. Teeth going up-and-out, helmet with a part in between his eyes and layered, very clearly Lei Shen.<br />
<br />
But yeah, the Mogu-Titan relationship might be the closest Creator-Offspring relationship we've seen... and about time we got to some ACTUAL titan meddling, Ra'den just doesn't cut it anymore after Algalon for me personally.<br />
<br />
On topic; The model could've used some sprucing up, but it's a nice texture and we don't have many dragonhawks yet! Beats our 50 mounts anniversary and the 100 one... albeit a retexture of that one. It is lacking in imagination, that's for sure.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, they could of done something much better. They already gave us a dragonhawk.<br />
<br />
They are seriously lacking freaking imagination. I think the reward for having 200 mounts should be much more than a stupid armored dragonhawk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Celestial Challenge is part of the Wrathion quest line.<br />
I think the person was looking more at how you won't be able to change spec while doing Celestial Challenge. Could be wrong.<br />
