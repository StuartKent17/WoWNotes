<br />
Honor was due to its highly granular nature awarded for way too much.<br />
It meant a lot of undesirable behaviour such as ganking which often did not contribute towards the end goal of the objectives, being more about humping the scoreboard or damage meter.<br />
Be awarded for a win, less so for a loss.<br />
<br />
If your behaviour contributed significantly towards a loss, you shouldn't be getting awarded for it.<br />
And while that does punish the whole team, including those who did contribute positively it I hope would discourage that negative behaviour more.</div></div><hr />

&quot;behaviour&quot; and a multiplier on damage are I feel very different things.<br />

The honor you got from kills in a BG was far outweighed by winning so you seem to be talking about stupid people there since honor from kills was pretty trivial. Even if you had a team pinned at the GY in WSG, ultimately there comes a point where killing there is not even remotely lucrative compared to getting into another BG and even losing it.<br />

Oh thank Goomy, I was ready to quit solo BGs. My Ele shaman already has it rough with all the mongo melee plaguing the random queues -- especially when soloing (and it will only get worse in Legion), things like grenades and rocket belts were just things that literally made my shaman's life easier by covering up some of the spec's weaknesses.</div></div><hr />

Also, what's the point in saying they are &quot;talking about it&quot; 2 months before release. It automatically means, it won't happen yet.</div></div><hr />

No, it isn't a 180 or anything of the sort.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
First off I question why interrupts are still a thing... it is an unfair advantage that melee have over casters. (Though casters have the interrupt as well)<br />
<br />
Can you interrupt a melee class? No.<br />
<br />
Now if casters had disarm spells... then it might be fair.<br />
<br />
So I question why interrupts are even still part of design.<br />
<br />
<br />
More to the point though. Kickbotting is a HUGE problem. Quite frankly all competitive PvP should be put on hiatus until they fix it.<br />
<br />
It is HUGELY prevalent top rated PvP. But don't you dare use it, because if you're one of the ones we catch and take action on... oooooh boy are you fucked.<br />
<br />
By not taking decisive action you create an even bigger problem: legitimate players weighing the costs of cheating themselves to remain competitive.<br />
<br />
Fuck bugs, hacks, cheats etc... by not giving a fuck, you have destroyed the spirit of competition (likely to never be redeemed)<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a group of people that has a full time job of reviewing player actions and punishing cheaters.<br />
Bullshit, bull... fucking... shit... I have reported the same players and the whole team (because if you play with a cheater you're just as guilty imo) for weeks on end. Never any action, I take special interest in the individuals I know for a fact are cheating, and end of the season comes and these fuckers still get rewards. Its horseshit.<br />
<br />
Revamping the PvP system should be secondary to maintaining the spirit and integrity of player versus player activity.<br />
<br />
Cheating (all forms) should be a no tolerance issue, and if you have a problem you know about, it should be all hands on deck until a solution can be found.<br />
<br />
So finding a solution to kickbotting is a challenge... fuck you and your challenges. The players have been ones enduring that &quot;challenge&quot;. I can't believe we didn't even get an apology... just a &quot;its soooo hard!&quot; Other companies hell even other Blizzard franchises take a hard stance on cheating and it shows and the game(s) are better for it. What really shows in WoW is how lax they have been on cheating.<br />
<br />
If it is such a challenge and taking longer than expected... they should (at the very least) suspend competitive play and PvP rewards until it is resolved. There is no reason that these players should continue to play and receive rewards from an admittedly, broken system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is not a new thing having different modifiers, so why this obsession you have with the &quot;complexity&quot; to justify your argument.<br />
<br />
Where is this &quot;scenario&quot; you talk about.<br />
Give me a link that states that different damage is confusing, more so than different behaviour.<br />
Then you may have an argument, but still won't convince me or anyone else with common sense that it is less confusing to have a mechanics tweak before a numbers tweak.<br />
You dismiss my view constantly with that &quot;scenario&quot; but provide no reason why that is better.<br />
<br />
Even if there were a reversal, why is it actually a bad thing.<br />
People change their minds.<br />
And if your entire complaint is that someone did change their mind, rather than arguing why is it actually a bad decision, then that speaks volumes about your determination to complain about something for the sake of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many years did the Devs either scream at us that they didn't want to make this game where PvP and PvE had either different spells or PvP modifiers to existing spells?<br />
<br />
How many years were we told that it was too complicated or too much work and thus had to deal with broken classes and wicked terrible imbalances that structurally couldn't be fixed because that would mean breaking a function spec in PvE?<br />
<br />
And now? We have what people were talking about all along... a PvP modifier... About damn time.<br />
<br />
And no way I believe that this is Legion tech that is so super complicated that they could only included it in this expac. They've had spell modifiers in the game for ages. Heck, an analogy would be Ele Flame Shock/Lava Burst. With Flame Shock applied, the modifier is that Lava Burst is a guaranteed crit. That's a conditional modifier, but still. Even if they might have liked to do it a bit differently than they are doing it now, it is doubtful that such modifiers would have been the technical hurdle it was portrayed as being.<br />
<br />
It was just work they didn't want to do. I'm glad they're finally...FINALLY doing it...but admit to resenting a little that for so long so much crap hasn't gotten fixed that could have gotten fixed and didn't for no other reason than didn't wan't PvP and PvE to be different even though even as the most casual PvPer maybe ever, even *I* know that the playstyle, setup, gearing and just about everything is different from PvE. <br />
<br />
It was like trying to feed a dog and cat the same kibble. <br />
<br />
I just hope they can get it to the point where it doesn't feel like specifically there are a few super strong PvP specs and unless you learn those, forget having fun in PvP. PvP could really benefit from having an increased diversity of viable specs.</div></div><hr />

They cannot think of different modes of play. There is only capture the flag, capture the point, drain points from enemy team, score points by capture the flag/point or push the cart or kill players... <br />

To be fair, its hard to find really new ways to do a battleground, that's why they say (but in other words): If we ever make &quot;new&quot; battlegrounds it will just be a different map, not different gameplay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is one of the things I really don't dig about today's WoW. Not like it is a big deal or that it greatly influences my enjoyment of the game, but overall it's just bland and boring. Yes, it's exciting when you get lucky, but only for a short moment. Imho that doesn't really fit a MMORPG. Even with &quot;bad luck protection&quot;, you're still essentially playing without knowing when you'll progress your character.<br />
<br />
I much prefer a system like WotLK's tbh. Sure, doing a random heroic every day, or going to a raid every week only gives you a small ammount of emblems each time. Entering a battleground or arena can only give you a bit of honor/conquest each time. But as you play you are aware you are progressing on your character/objective. With each daily random heroic dungeon, with each arena win, with each daily battleground win, you get a little closer to a good piece of gear, a piece you can choose depending on your need. And that amazingly fits a MMORPG imho. Especially since while you're doing content for those emblems you still have the RNG of possibly getting a good item (ie in raids).<br />
<br />
I'd love if they kept the honor/conquest system on top of the randomness (even if that meant slower rates of winning honor/conquest). And if they got back to the emblem system where even if you don't get an upgrade for weeks, at least you got significantly closer to being able to buy a good piece of gear.<br />
<br />

It's only a small progress each time, but it's a guaranteed progress. Much more satisfying long-term than winning stuff to vendor 99% of the time, and basicly have no actual progress from 90% of the repeatable things you do unless RNG says so. If I wanted to gamble, I'd play a gambling game =P</div></div><hr />

If the players want PvP, go play Overwatch or whatever it's called that was designed as a PvP game from the start. Stop trying to force us into PvP to get gear or for any other reason. It really isn't fun for most people, and it is even less fun when you're forced to do it for whatever reason. <br />
<br />
So, no, MOST players will not want to PvP much less get into rated PvP, and you guys are idiots for trying to force us to do so. My .02.</div></div><hr />

Devs explicitly said they are not tuning numbers differently because it would be too complicated<br />
<br />
That is entirely your argument, that the devs &quot;said this&quot;.<br />
You can't actually give any reason why it is bad,<br />
You can't actually think for yourself.<br />
<br />
You keep reapeating the same thing instead of actually providing any reasoning WHY tweaking the numbers is oh so bad.<br />
Can you actually come up with some thoughts of your own as to why adjusting mechanics should be be done instead ?<br />
Can you actually provide a link to this, given how the template itself is a &quot;tweaking of numbers&quot; inherently and in addition to the other changes in line with what they have already been doing for years, it would seem to contradict this apparent statement you hold onto so dearly.</div></div><hr />

Good News Mate, PVP will be an awful source for Gear in Legion - it was only a good way of getting ilvl 710 Gear in WoD because of the Honor Points, and now they are gone. PVE(Raids, Dungeons, Professions) Content will get you the Gear you need at faster rate by far.</div></div><hr />

im fine with that but they should really work on dota-style of BG that would be 5v5, that would be really great, you get in there naked and try your best, cant be that hard to make when scenaion technology is there<br />

this would definitely make some players come back, atleast I would play it all day long instead of LoL/whatever clones there is</div></div><hr />

What they put in is not bad luck protection, it's just a decreased chance of getting the same item again. You still can have bad luck and get crap item after crap item ;)</div></div><hr />

yeah whatever you say man. A reduced chance for items you already wear is a bag change and tilts things very well in your favor. It essentially is bad luck protection, not bad luck immunity.</div></div><hr />

Well PVP Gear can roll the titanforged bonus, so every item can be an upgrade... so they would limit your chances of an upgrade.<br />
Or to they just mean the final result of the rolls with the reduces chance?</div></div><hr />

However, why in the hell don't we have cross faction PVE content at this point... Virtually every major third-party faction in the game that you end up helping at one point or another has members from both sets of races. I know the Horde and Alliance are still having pissing matches here and there, but when it comes to the major story-driven PVE events, can't we set aside our differences, cross the aisle, and help each other out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Would totally love a simple, non-objective based team deathmatch BG (600 points are given to both commands at the start, every death is minus one point, who gets 0 points first loses), and a simple, non-objective based deathmatch everyone vs everyone BG (same 600 points, every death is minus 1, when the counter reaches 0, BG is closed, top half of players are winners, low half of players are losers).<br />
<br />
There are TONS of simple yet fucking great ideas, problems are developers need to work instead of sitting there with thumbs deep in their asses removing things people loved and adding nothing to replace removed things. This is the second expansion of &quot;less is more&quot; absurd logic, I bet it will end just as good as first one ended.<br />
<br />
Also: am I the only one who thinks that when Blizzard just shit on balance we get more playable specs in high end pvp, then when they &quot;woo hoo we r professionulz we do balance hurr durr&quot; and then you get like five playable specs for an expansion lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Fucking finally someone has some sense in that development team and figuring out there is WAAAYY too much content in the game already and some of the old ones need to be removed or cycled out and I agree. They should do this for PVE as well when they start figuring that out is beyond me, having 7 games worth of content is unworkable even with a team of 300 people as everything goes up exponentially as you work on a new expansion EVEN the previous developers have said this in Blizzard yet none are taken to heart.<br />
<br />
You say it isn't well lets take an example of a game which is of similar age like Magic the Gathering image if you ALLOWED all sets to be avaliable and unlimited now that's the clusterfuck the PVE status is in WOW right now. They need to make a game that's easy to work on and this is the reason why they can't get expansion to come out fast cause every expansion they make it must trickle down the line to even those that are not revelant to the current story line like Vanilla, TBC with Outlands and Northrend.<br />
<br />
And to people who are gonna shift my fucking words around again like little children, it's fine to have old content that's REVELANT to the current storyline aka Deathwing and the old gods. but it's not fine to have content that's irrelevant to the story-line like LICH KING and ILLDIAN DEAD and imprisoned aka WC3 to Wrath of the lich king content. They should of removed the old irrelevant content already if they are &quot;focusing on the lore&quot; which every players know they don't give a two shits about now.</div></div><hr />
