Flex Item Levels<br />
Watcher commented on the item level requirements of many PuG Flex groups, as well as sharing that usually people who do Wing 1 and 2 are somewhere in the 530s and Wing 3 and 4 are in the 540s.<br />

WoW Customer Loyalty Program<br />
This has been a topic of constant discussion and debate for years now, both within the community and internally here at Blizzard. It's a surprisingly controversial subject on all fronts, but I'm sure tagging this thread with blue won't kick up any dust... (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/289200-wow-should-have-customer-loyalty-program/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11205641164?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
Leveling and Arena Ratings<br />
We're working on a hotfix for this issue right now. The intention is that only players at level 70, 80, 85, or 90 should be able to queue for Arenas, and that as soon as a player levels up, their ratings will be reset.<br />
<br />
lore can you guys reset the people that have leveled to 90 with level 89 ratings<br />
Yep, that's the plan. It may not happen at the same time that the hotfix applies, but we'll be resetting ratings for those characters. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/289203-70-74-and-80-84-arena/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11223762787?page=1#9))<br />
<br />
A Day in the Life of Blizzard<br />
We had a short run of something similar to what you describe with our &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; series, released during Blizzard's 20th anniversary: http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/b20/interviews.html (Even our team's own Bashiok is featured!)<br />
<br />
There's definitely some value to opening up our doors a bit more, so to speak, and giving the community an opportunity to get to know more of the names and faces within Blizzard, and the work-related responsibilities those people have.<br />
<br />
That said, it does take a fair amount of resources from multiple departments to put features like that together. When possible we like to couple them with other announcements or initiatives to provide more background and context for what we're working on.<br />
<br />
One thing we do fairly often as well is sit various developers and other Blizzard content creators down with fan/media sites for interviews. Ideally that allows for more community-driven questions to be answered, as opposed to any of us rather aimlessly talking about our day-to-day operations. They're also easier to pull off given that we're not publishing the content ourselves -- meaning much fewer resources on our end are required. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/289161-some-kinda-inside-blizzard-series/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11223562725?page=1#4))<br />

Legendary Questline<br />
I posted about this somewhere before, but I can't find it now...<br />
<br />
I'll largely avoid the tedious vs. challenging conversation as I'm not feeling very eloquent right now, but I will say that it's about variety. There need to be a wide variety of things to do with a wide variety of requirements to build a whole experience and appeal to any particular player at any particular moment in their schedule, knowledge, or skill with the game.<br />
<br />
Ok, in any case, with the Legendary questline in Mists we wanted to have a reward that everyone could follow along with as the expansion progressed, and to create a story and gear-upgrade thread throughout the expansion, ultimately leading to a Legendary item of some kind. Also while developing the expansion it was important for us to support this fairly new system called LFR, and so for the Legendary to also be accessible regardless of the raid difficulty you were involved in. Obviously both have been really successful, and we're happy with hitting the goals we set for ourselves. That said we definitely learned a lot of lessons, and definitely agree on the 3000 VP step being wholly un-Legendary in particular. We think there's certainly room to improve for a future Legendary or Legendaries, and bigger goals to set to provide a challenging and rewarding experience to appeal to and be accessible by a wide range of players - to be completely vague about it. Overall I'd say we're on the same page.

Unfortunately we don't have access to all of that nice data Blizzard does, so keep in mind I was working with what we have:<br />
<br />
<br />
~41% of people with an item level over 540 and no Normal or Heroic Garrosh kills have killed Garrosh.<br />
The average item level for someone that killed each boss in flex and has not killed in in normal or heroic:<br />
<br />
General Nazgrim - 538.2<br />
Spoils of Pandaria - 539.3<br />
Siegecrafter Blackfuse - 542.4<br />

Must be 545+&quot; and then they want you to show them your ahead of the curve achievement. Seriously? To do a lesser version of a raid you want me to show that I've done a HARDER version of it? There is little logic in this.<br />
<br />
I understand that some people want their &quot;quick runs&quot; and that's fine...but it's becoming a rampant trend now to require people to OVERGEAR content to get an invite to a raid group. Even moreso than in the past.<br />
<br />
Believe me, I'm all for giving folks the opportunity to raid on their own time/terms and whatever...but it's not really fun when I'm sitting @ a 549 item level and keep getting denied invites to FLEX groups because I haven't killed Garrosh on normal or my ilvl isn't high enough.<br />
<br />
I hate ilvl and I hate what it has done to peoples' expectations. It's just yet ANOTHER way for players in this game to be elitist and exclusionary.</div></div><hr />

For a successful group to require the item level of gear that drops in the raid seems a bit high to me. It's not too absurd, but I think you should be able to do it with a gear level a bit lower than the level of gear that drops, 530 to successfully complete all of Flex (with perhaps the exception of Wing 4 being around 535) would be ideal imho. <br />
<br />
Although with the ability to upgrade our gear's ilvl via VP, perhaps that's why they can require such a high ilvl for success. <br />
<br />
If I had never been told the stats for successful groups' ilvls, I would have been pretty happy with the difficulty of Flex. Although as someone whose ilvl is 540 right on the nose, I find some of the Flex mechanics a bit trivial (but some still pack a good punch). Overall, very happy with Flex.</div></div><hr />

This. Although it werent too bad being horde. 1 or 2 shot for a BG victory. Albeit the time consumed doing this probably wont compare to the time PvPers are using on PvE content to get the cloack. But it is a PvE cloack, sint it ? (aka not usable in arenas etc).<br />

Fixed. If you run with a guild group you would get a little bit more loot in the beginning, and little bit less in the end, the average gearing time should stay the same as now, but if you would make random groups it would be beneficial to take some lower iLvl players with you to boost your chance to get loot.</div></div><hr />

The groups are there. BUT I'll freely admit I avoid them. On the very rare occasion I run flex it's just a valor farm to finish up my cap. So yea I join the 550+ groups on my main. The ppl I join with are usually in the same boat. Valor farm =/= gear run. <br />
<br />
If you want to run at the 530-540 range go in a guild group or create your own. I do it when I run an alt , it's not difficult. But don't chastise ppl like me for wanting a quick run when were literally just farming some quick valor or maybe mount achieves. <br />
<br />
The lowest ilvl in my group is like 564 so no if it's our main group we aren't going to carry unless it's a guildie or you can somehow prove you won't waste our time. However we run 5-6 successful normal alt runs a week in which they all make it to at least siege, most to Garrosh. Flex runs we host yes we ask for 540 but if you have ahead of the curve and you're just gearing an alt were more likely to carry. This isn't elitism it's not wanting to waste time. Nearly every time we make an exception to our limits we end up wanting to strangle the pug bc they do something stupid like run off to the side on galaktras instead of behind the group with the fireball. And that's bc they swear they know the fights instead of just admitting they needed explanation. (Which we are perfectly fine giving, but after you wipe or nearly wipe the raid is too late to ask)<br />
<br />
So I'm sorry if some people are being left out in the cold but attitude is a big part of the issue. I know for a fact I am in one of the most active raiding guilds on my very busy server. The shear amount of runs my RL orchestrates weekly and carries people through is insane. But if you are dishonest about your actual experience were gonna notice. And that usually means you won't be coming with us again. If you're new admit it. You might be surprised to see there are guilds like mine who will accommodate newer ppl. Just don't expect to get thrown in the heroic groups and handed all the loot.</div></div><hr />

The groups are there. BUT I'll freely admit I avoid them. On the very rare occasion I run flex it's just a valor farm to finish up my cap. So yea I join the 550+ groups on my main. The ppl I join with are usually in the same boat. Valor farm =/= gear run. <br />
<br />
If you want to run at the 530-540 range go in a guild group or create your own. I do it when I run an alt , it's not difficult. But don't chastise ppl like me for wanting a quick run when were literally just farming some quick valor or maybe mount achieves. <br />

I think this is an issue where the exception is not the rule. Your group may be listing reasonable requirements, but many spamming trade on servers like illidan asking for 550-560 item level are not guild groups. This has been going on for a long time, all the way back to ICC. The general player base is expecting non guild raiders to create their own group with high requirements in order to be carried to the ahead of the curve achievement by people who already have it. When enough people follow that trend strictly you end up in a situation where lots of piss poor quality PUGs are formed with players have an elitist attitude while at the same time being anywhere from terrible to nothing special at their class.<br />
<br />
Couple that with the widely accepted idea that over 50% of pug raids lose players after one wipe, and you have a perfect storm of exclusionary players behaving irrationally, making it tedious for players who quit for even one tier to consider a casual non-LFR raid. That all goes without mentioning that people who were &quot;born in and molded by&quot; this environment legitimately think this is the way it should always work and that it can't possibly work any other way.<br />
<br />
It leaves a bad taste in people's mouths just by considering the foray.</div></div><hr />

If one of your characters has got the Legendary, then for the alts it should be easier to do the same quest line. By half on everything, half the valor, half the items you need to collect...I mean ffs if u have collected 20 sigils and then another 20 later of similar nature (ToT) then that's 40, with an alt it's 80 and many of us have several alts.. For me, it would take several hundred sigils... so that is fookd up with this current insane grind...</div></div><hr />

You kind of answered a large part of the problem in your reply though. Trade chat isn't the only avenue to find a group. OpenRaid and Oqueue are there and can easily be taken advantage of. I almost never acknowledge trade chat groups these days b/c of all the reasons you listed. The only way to fix the issue is to make them keep looking. More reasonable groups are being formed on the two avenues I suggested, people just need to take more advantage of them. Most experienced players can agree that trade chat in general is a cesspool. Avoiding it completely has had very little effect on my gameplay, and what effect it has had has all been positive.</div></div><hr />

Probably the best course of taking initiative I have seen from a player in a long time. I think they got the first two wings down on their first run (using TS) which is incredible for a forum group where 90% of the raid have never been in SoO (in fact the RL prioritizing those without the achievement)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Captiosus</div><div class="date">2014-01-15, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is that not the Proving Grounds?<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds are meaningless. Yes, it scales all your gear down to 463 but the DPS &quot;mechanics&quot; in them favor specific classes and also have very little in common with mechanics one would actually see while raiding. The healing ones are a complete travesty because the NPCs are complete and utter idiots. You can do everything right and still fail because of bad AI. <br />
<br />
It should be very telling that there are threads on guide sites telling people how to optimize, specifically, for Proving Grounds. Often those &quot;optimizations&quot; run contrary to how someone would be optimized for group/raid content. The only redeeming function of Proving Grounds is the fact that, at the lowest level, it's a tutorial of sorts. For example, bronze level DPS teaches the basics of priority targeting, something that is completely glossed over in the current mad dash from 1-90.<br />
<br />
<br />
What they need to do for WoD is to change how the legendary quests work for alts. If one of your characters has got the Legendary, then for the alts it should be easier to do the same quest line.<br />
<br />
No. The cloak was never intended to be had by each and every one of your alts. This is evident in the fact that only one character with the cloak is required for ALL characters on the account to be able to participate in Ordos kills. The line has already been nerfed to take almost half the amount of time as it originally did. As I've said repeatedly on the official forums, be thankful they gave everyone the ability to get a legendary beyond the typical 1-2% legendary that usually happens. If you want it for alts, the line is there, nerfed, and perfectly reasonable. Considering we know we still have several months of this patch for PVE, you have ample time to finish.</div></div><hr />

Having not &quot;raided&quot; since Wrath LFR was fun and reminded me of the old days of raiding, as in, all I am doing is beating a scripted event. The real challenge is getting ten or more people to dance in sequence. LFR just means one or two judges look away occasionally :P</div></div><hr />

And that's fine. They shouldn't give even a whiff of credibility to the idea that they're somehow surprised at it being used for that. There's really no solution for pugs in that sense. They are what they are and if you can't join one you can start your own if you're brave enough.</div></div><hr />

Cant get in any LFR unless i wait 2 hours for one half done, and the people running flex want me to be Heroic gears in the same raid Im trying flex??? The only way i could raid anymore is if I can find 10 real life friends to re-sub the game and since I cant find any willing to. Game is dead for me<br />

Fast? I hope you mean the raid itself once you get past the huge Q.</div></div><hr />
