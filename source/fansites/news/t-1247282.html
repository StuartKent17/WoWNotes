Dude.<br />
<br />
This was just a &quot;Hey, here's a small glimpse at what's happening this patch&quot;.<br />
<br />
Instead of.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey here's the ENTIRE NEW ZONE WITH EVERYTHING, along with LORE MONOLOGUE, CINEMATIC ANIMATIONS, and A FULL RAID PREVIEW.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurbz</div><div class="date">2013-01-07, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It seems a lot of people here need to learn the difference between a teaser and a trailer. They are very different things and serve completely different purposes. As a teaser, this was perfectly fine.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard hasn't put out an actual trailer (the ones with story and voiceovers and such) for a patch since Patch 4.2. Unless you count the MoP cinematic, which I don't. Seems they now prefer to include those as in-game cinematics instead of putting them on youtube.</div></div><hr />

Would have been nice if this was more jungle-y and brighter. I haven't done much in the way of Klaxxi rep because I cannot stand that ugly ass gloomy Dread Wastes. At least Icecrown had snow to brighten it up a little. Will spend as little amount of time in this zone as possible, if I even do any of it. Though the triceratops mounts would be kinda nice to have.</div></div><hr />

There is a difference between a teaser and trailer. A teaser is more like a trailer for a trailer.</div></div><hr />

As as a teaser went, this certainly teased. I'm teased.</div></div><hr />

The community for this game are so toxic, all you do is complain when Blizzard has seriously upped their game. Do you even remember Cataclysm? Otherwise known as World of Queues? This teaser did its job of giving you titbits about the new patch, obviously the patch isn't complete enough to show yo voice acting etc. and you've got to remember its been the holidays so people will have been off work!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I thought the same thing. It does have a very Zul'Drak feel to it. Which does make some sense given the connection to the Zandalari. I think the dark, stormy/gloomy atmosphere also makes the comparison more likely.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately for you (but fortunately for us), the Troll story is massive and can be taken many directions. It isn't like we're doing Zul'Gurub for the 5th time, or even Gun'drak. Why is it that trolls bother you?<br />

And, if you don't mind me asking, what kind of things besides warcraft do you still do today that you were doing in 2005? Or even 2007?<br />
<br />
This argument always gets me. &quot;I'm so bored with WoW now, I've played for 8 years I guess I should just quit cause this game sucks now&quot;<br />

Teaser is a rough preview of some of the systems generally thrown together<br />
Trailer is a voice acted scripted video showcasing all the major new additions and a boss taunt. <br />
<br />
This is a teaser, and the trailer will probably come in a month or 2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Back in the day I was ADDICTED to wow hardcore and played it for hours upon hours. quit twice for long periods of time 8-10 month roughly.<br />
I didnt say wow sucks the game is amazin probs the best ever IMHO. just like ive said if you do any thing for such a long time it gets boring.<br />
ive played alot of other games too in the later years. but because ive played it soo much new patches/expansions you research ahead of time to prepare ready for the new few levels but in the end new talents etc the game is still the same. and like mentioned b4 im due for good year off because ive over played xD<br />
not sure where I said it sucked but I'm sure my addiction will pull me back hopefully HOTS will keep busy for a while.<br />
hope that cleared up my opinion. sorry you seen it as hate</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keristrasza</div><div class="date">2013-01-07, 08:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Kinda bad teaser. Its missing:<br />
Voice acting<br />
A boss taunt<br />
Fights<br />
Daily quest zones (with npcs)<br />
Lore (it didnt tell me anything why should i go there)<br />
<br />
Only thing i have seen:<br />
Dino models<br />
Arena<br />
Last boss (doing nothing)<br />
<br />
Hence why it is called a teaser and not a trailer, it did it's job in making you want to see more. Which is proven by your demand to see those things which is found within a trailer (Never a teaser). When the patch is close to launch then you will get a Trailer, just like most major patches get. Like the original Naxx 40, Black Temple, Zul'aman(The original) etc. ;x</div></div><hr />

Then I don't think you do it's supposed to tease us and not show much. It may seem half assed but that's the point of a teaser. If anything you aren't being rasonable.

From the looks of this, we ain't seeing 5.2 for a few months yet.<br />
<br />
EDIT: And yes, some of us know what a &quot;teaser&quot; trailer is. It's still dull... Completely lack-lustre.<br />
<br />

Seriously, if this is what they're showing off with their teasers, I'm not even gonna bother to continue looking at my druid after my 10day pass runs out...<br />
<br />
We see a couple of dinosaurs, raptors? Seriously? Some half-assed artwork?<br />

Says the Rift fan, You play your game, We play ours. This a WoW fansite, you don't like it than leave or don't say anything as your opinions mean nothing here unless your in the Rift sub thread. Don't come in here and shout your mouth off without any sense of knowledge about the patch. <br />
<br />
Thank you<br />

Was this done in 20 minutes? Couldn't they at least populate the areas first and use a grass floor instead of a wireframe for model viewing?<br />
<br />
The whole point of a 'TEASER'. It is not final</div></div><hr />

A Teaser video is not the same thing as a trailer. That Ulduar trailer is epic though. Gave me chills.<br />

The main reason why I am continuing to raid is because they said 5.2 will be as good as ulduar and I loved ulduar. Otherwise I would of unsubbed just before xmas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
..What? While this does look cool it doesn't give me an Ulduar vibe in the slightest. If anything it gives me a Black Temple vibe except very linear.<br />
<br />
That's my biggest complaint with this raid and all raids Blizzard puts out now. They're always simply linear. Go down this hallway and kill a boss and then take a turn kill another boss, keep going down the hallway kill a boss, turn again and kill the final boss. Ulduar, Black Temple, etc were amazing because of how open they were. From what I can tell by the maps and videos of this raid its another linear place. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I'm sure this raid will still be awesome. I'm just sick of linear hallways.</div></div><hr />

Dinoriders indeed, come on blizz get more original ideas of your own, more and more of this expansion seems to be rip offs from other games / movies.</div></div><hr />

Actually if you look at a video preview of the raid you can see that there are a lot of paths you can take towards the end of the raid</div></div><hr />

Please, tell me how you did Reliquary before Bloodboil, or Mimiron before Freya.<br />
<br />
Just because the illusion of the &quot;option&quot; is there doesn't mean that people raided the instances non-linearly.<br />
<br />
As long as this game, and min/maxing exists, there will be a designated &quot;correct&quot; way to go through normal modes. The path of least resistance will always outweigh any &quot;non linear&quot; raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It feels like people just use that as an excuse to bash the game.<br />
<br />
Clearly people forgot that people always did Black Temple the same way. People nearly always did Ulduar the exact same way, same with ICC, ect.<br />
<br />
Such an obvious cop out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A plethora of Heroic raiding guilds a few took a non-linear rout because it WAS the path of least resistance this tier.<br />
<br />
Some guilds skipped Spirit Kings Heroic to do Elegon Heroic. Others did not.<br />
<br />
Some guilds skipped Empress Heroic to clear 2/4 or 3/4 Springs Heroic first. Others did not.<br />
<br />
It was easier to skip and granted more loot, but if you could kill the harder ones by staying linear (Kings/Empress) in a decent amount of time, your guild often ended up with more points on WoW Progress. That is of course what determines guild ranking.</div></div><hr />
