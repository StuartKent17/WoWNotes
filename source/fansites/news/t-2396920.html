Kul Tiras (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Kul_Tiras) was founded 3,000 years ago when a group of Gilneans (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gilneas_(kingdom)) left the empire to explore the Great Sea (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Great_Sea). They came upon a mountainous region rich in resources and decided to settle in. Over the course of the next 2,500 years they built one of the most powerful navies on Azeroth. These humans are much more burly than the mainlanders because of their time spent on the sea hunting monsters. The Alliance will be bringing them into their ranks as an Allied Race.<br />

That's pretty subjective tho. Not everyone wants to look like an undead monster when running around as a druid. It's like saying everyone wants to play Undead because they're cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, I'd consider it pretty silly if we didn't have that option, and the more their full development gets delayed, the more hope I have on this front. There is something slowing Kul Tirans from becoming a complete picture developmentally right now, and I can't help but feel like &quot;body variety&quot; could be the big selling point of this race (for non-druids anyway). I don't expect the skinny body, but I think the standard human frame as a toggle is still something we could see, because I have yet to see a large gathering of Kul Tirans in beta where they are all the same size. The existing customization options feel incomplete enough to be &quot;half the picture,&quot; (two male faces?) and a beta or even later 8.1 PTR patch including &quot;surprise the body size is an option&quot; doesn't feel crazy.</div></div><hr />

Solid preview, boys.<br />

...and if MMO C doesn't post it, but another website does - people would complain how MMO C sucks and are slow....<br />

Win / win for people who like to complain, no matter what....I was mostly joking, but I'm not sure who would complain about MMO-Champion being &quot;slow&quot; if another site did it first, there's hardly any information yet. I don't think anybody would have blamed them for waiting to do a preview later if another site did it first.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">plaits</div><div class="date">2018-05-13, 11:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, I'd consider it pretty silly if we didn't have that option, and the more their full development gets delayed, the more hope I have on this front. There is something slowing Kul Tirans from becoming a complete picture developmentally right now, and I can't help but feel like &quot;body variety&quot; could be the big selling point of this race (for non-druids anyway). I don't expect the skinny body, but I think the standard human frame as a toggle is still something we could see, because I have yet to see a large gathering of Kul Tirans in beta where they are all the same size. The existing customization options feel incomplete enough to be &quot;half the picture,&quot; (two male faces?) and a beta or even later 8.1 PTR patch including &quot;surprise the body size is an option&quot; doesn't feel crazy.<br />
<br />
People who criticise the largeness of the Kul Tirans are people I'm assuming are not on beta. They're HUGE all over, and look far more proportionate when you're actually looking at them in game and not just on 2d pictures on a website. They're like, 7 feet tall. They are probably impractically tall. I hope Blizz have designed them to fit through doorways properly! <br />
<br />
KT regular sized humans with the large KT human hairstyles etc would be nice, otherwise they're just humans that can be druids. Admittedly really awesome druids, and no doubt most KTs are going to end up being druids, the same way most lightforged dranei are paladins.<br />
<br />
I don't know if we'll get the skinny KTs - there are only male versions of those so far and they're so clearly just reskinned forsaken females.</div></div><hr />

No, they won't do this. The only playable Stormwind humans are fit musclemen, and the only playable Kul Tiran humans are the big guys.<br />

If you want to play a smaller Kul Tiran... just play a Stormwind human and dress him up with Kul Tiras armor. There is no difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know what happened to the slender male kultiran model though, pretty sure that exists, seen it many many times. Hope we actually get that one too. <br />
<br />
Although I haven't seen the humans in action, I hope they use the orc skeleton, would be pretty great for people that want a more brutal less refined human character. <br />
<br />
Probably will reroll my female alliance characters to kultiran if i can be bothered, 20 bucks is a little steep for something that isn't exactly a &quot;race&quot;<br />

The default human model will be used for the Kul Tirans, as the robust model is unavailalbe for playability. I repeat; the default human model will be used for the Kul Tirans, as the robust model is unavailable for playability.<br />

I highly doubt many people are going to play this race. I am fat IRL, why would I want to play as myself in game?<br />
<br />
Personally, I am going to call everyone that I see playing one of them, &quot;fatty&quot; or &quot;fatso&quot; while in game.<br />

We're not getting the robust model of the Kul Tirans. All humans are the same size; 2 meters for men, 1.8 meters for women - 185 pounds for men, 150 pounds for women.<br />
<br />
That is why the default human model will be available for playability for the Kul Tirans, but with tattoos, larger hairstyles and facial hair (no further than the upper waist), facial scars across the eyes, and same hair colors.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty obvious what the other classes are going to be.<br />

We're going to have hunters (because survival) rogues ( because combat ) mages ( because jaina) and since they're basically pandaren by now, might as well give them monks (brewmaster) and shamans ( watery elements)</div></div><hr />

I had kind of hoped they would go for that with the way the nightfallen were cured by magic and nature and valewalker teaching them. I mean some fat ass monk teaching them kung fu supposedly works, a race highly apt with magical talent surely could figure out druidsm faster than panda martial arts and mistweaving.<br />

<br />
Odd, I somehow always feel that they don't get the black skin right. They just look like black colored white people.<br />
<br />
I love that we get more diversity in human body shapes. It's World of Warcraft and not Clonewars. People that call them fat got no idea what fat really is. The males are more looking like Strongmen competitioners(well, actually they look like Mr. Olympia bodybuilders in their off-season) with a bit of Disney comics and Black Beard pirate stereotype thrown in. Just no fan of the comic look huge hands in general. I'd pick that body if I would make a new char for sure.<br />
You don't ike them, fine...many don't like the sterotypical androgyne look of male blood elves either(I would never ever seriously play one but with a twink I win almost any dress up contest with him in a skirt, bunny ears and a rose in his mouth. And even if I don't win I know the others are having a lot of fun in front of their screen in that moment. ;-)). No reason to get insulting.<br />
<br />
The female ones are looking odd to me. The arms are too muscled for the legs(or for a woman in general). The upper legs seem really big compared to the chest. It's like they wanted to make a fat person up to the hip...and then decided that the upper part should be a russian shot putter with breast implants instead. Somehow reminds me a bit of Chyna in her wrestling days...just with thick legs and a bit more body fat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all you guys saying &quot;fat&quot;, &quot;obese&quot;, &quot;unattractive&quot;...even going far as &quot;disgusting&quot; and &quot;repulsive&quot; ...why?<br />
<br />
would you say this to real people in the real world? would you call real people fat and disgusting like you're doing here? ...considering most WoW players won't be winning any beauty pageants anytime soon, let's be real here, I don't understand your problem. <br />
<br />
If I was overweight and wanted to find a character choice that represented me as a person, does the cookie-cutter human accurately represent that? could I recreate myself virtually? probably not. I'd be pretending to be someone I wasn't and hiding a flaw. WHEREAS with a larger model I could more accurately represent who I was.. as well as getting that extra character attachment, which is always nice. <br />
<br />
...and hey, maybe if I lost weight in the real world I'd swap to the original model...who knows..<br />
<br />
I agree with promoting a healthy image generally (not overweight) but the reality is there are many people who ARE overweight, and some people actually PREFER people who are of a certain weight. It's a pretty toxic and disappointing reaction to be honest. <br />
<br />
(I personally like average looking women that don't try too hard, the idea of a large muscular pirate with a beer-belly also isn't &quot;repulsive&quot; to me...he's being his own person)<br />
<br />
If someone wants to play as and be a bbw that's absolutely fine with me. Do I judge people based on how they look in a virtual game? I don't try to. <br />
<br />
I guess your argument is something stupid like &quot;it's a fantasy game! we don't need fatties in a fantasy game&quot;...I think what you need to remember is World of Warcraft encompasses many millions of people from the real world who would like to be represented in a virtual one. who are you to decide who does and doesn't get represented? If you want a game without &quot;fatties&quot;...then go ahead and make your own game. <br />
<br />
I just think you guys need to chill out. I don't know what caused your outbursts here, most of which are pretty awful low-hanging fruit jokes or insults, are you in some deep denial? because A LOT of your fellow WoW players ARE morbidly obese or are at the opposite end of the spectrum, seriously underweight.</div></div><hr />

I'm having a hard time taking this seriously. they're kul tirans...they're humans....why would you need concept art for humans, why wouldn't you just tweak the existing human assets for these new albeit...overweight.. humans? <br />
<br />
...it's not like they're vrykul. Vrykul are supposed to look different, they are ancestors of humans, the original humans were born from vrykul as &quot;cursed and deformed babies&quot; specifically before being exiled to the south for EXACTLY that reason. <br />

It's a shame that people fall into the trap of &quot;I'm not good enough to be around other people, so I have to change the way my face looks.&quot; It's one of my major pet-peeves. how about you?<br />
<br />
Also yes, the female kul-tiran model is very clearly using the same animations as the female pandaren.<br />
<br />
someone will be pedantic though like usual and mention the fact that all models use the &quot;universal model framework&quot; blizzard implemented some time ago which although does exist doesn't change the reality that these skeletons and animations for those skeletons belong to the female pandaren.<br />
<br />
&quot;Why?&quot;<br />
<br />
Allied races are cheap to make, they're not investing much resources here, considering there are going to be upwards of 6 allied races at the beginning of bfa..and likely more throughout the course of the expansion it's unfeasible to have these be entirely unique. The new buzzword is quantity, not quality.<br />

Personally, I am going to call everyone that I see playing one of them, &quot;fatty&quot; or &quot;fatso&quot; while in game.<br />
<br />
&quot;Waiting on fatty to catch up to the raid, then we pull.&quot;<br />
&quot;Hey fatso, cookies please.&quot;<br />
<br />
Players are already calling Pandaren &quot;Fatty&quot; and making food/beer jokes. Find something else more &quot;original&quot; for the Kultiran x)</div></div><hr />

All druid forms are just ... not fitting at all, seriously!?<br />
<br />
Those forms are more like forsaken's druid forms than &quot;human&quot; ones<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, they really look quite strange... i had difficulty in understanding what they stand for (besides the coolness aesthetical factor).<br />
<br />
They seem like Botani-infested creatures somewhat like the ones seen Draenor, where their legs become branches and their faces and bones turn into wood. I prefer the dino forms from the Zandalari.<br />

I have read one month ago they might seem somewhat like Draenor Botani, as Zandalari balance druids are inspired in Adherent Arakkoa</div></div><hr />

I know is hard to read this day, but if you take 5m to google about this Druid form, you will see that they are related to how Kul'thiras use Druidic power. Those form represent how they used their druidic power. There is a full quest line about this, and probably will be related to what we need to do to unlock it.</div></div><hr />

None of the other heritage armor sets are faction themed, they are race themed, cuz they are race armor...<br />

The coat is most likely not their heritage armor, as it is missing many armor pieces like a shoulder, a helm and distinctive boots. It is most likely a placeholder.</div></div><hr />

Hard for me is to understand is what your &quot;I know is hard to read this day&quot; has to do with my reply :confused:<br />
<br />
Yes, Blizzard has stated that Kul Tiras Humans and Zandalari Trolls are unique druids, different from the rest.<br />
I haven't played alpha or beta, so i haven't the knowledge about the quests lore. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to read spoilers of the entire quest lines of the new expansion, i'd rather wait for them to come live as it cuts the fun out of it.<br />
Some general spoilers i do like though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, there is a middle ground between a fat, nasty masculine body vs anorexic. Plenty of ways to shape a female body that still gives off a sexy, feminine vibe while being a bit thicc.<br />
<br />
I think you just might like dudes, but are having trouble coming to grips with it.</div></div><hr />
