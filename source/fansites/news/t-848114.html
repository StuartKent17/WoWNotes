An apparent last-minute bug which was not found on the PTR before the patch was finalized has caused the client and server to disagree on the way haste affects resource generation. This bug will manifest itself in the UI showing a player they have enough resources to use an ability, but the server correctly prevents it as they in fact do not. A death knight for example might see a rune light up that isn’t actually available so when they use the ability, it won’t fire. A rogue may think they have enough energy to use Sinister Strike, but they can’t actually afford it so when they push the button, they will get an error. This bug could affect rogues, death knights, hunters and Feral druids, because these characters all gain more resources from haste. It will also affect buffs that affect attack speed, such as Slice and Dice, Windfury, Icy Talons, and Hunting Party, but also attack speed lowering effects like Thunder Clap. We're currently working on a fix. <br />

Becouse you are bad in this game doesn't mean that only nerds are doing heroics. Many 3 n 4 day raiding guilds are @ 6/12 hc + (like my guild). Got life, got studies and still have some time to play. <br />

This happens to me aswell :S~ What's going on here? My game launcher tells me its up to date, but the ingame patch no. still says 4.0.3 and im prompted to again download the patch. <br />

I dont think so. You will still need to free many drakes at once, to nerf Halfus' most dangerous techniques (attack speed, shadow nova, behemot drake bolts).</div></div><hr />

Conclave: Doesn't matter, since the debuff doesn't do anything important at all<br />
<br />
Yeah right, for an average guild, wind side is the most difficult, and i can tell you that you will see a lot of Conclave HM kills in the next few days, just because of those two nerfs. Getting instantly targeted by a windblast after a shield was something difficult to avoid for most people, now that you have a complete 5 seconds, it's just a joke. The debuff could also cause some deaths if you were low on shield dps, so please... It's indeed a huge nerf to Conclave HM.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Omnotron: Buff and Nerf<br />
<br />
Much more of a nerf than a buff imo. With the HP nerf you can still keep a heavy healer comp...<br />

Other than that i agree with you, just, Maloriak is now a joke, and Magmaw much more doable.</div></div><hr />

heroic maloriak is just terrible now, increase maloriak hp or something because we need to stop dps for the entire last blue and red phase :(<br />
<br />
Yet to do it on heroic, but on normal is totally pathetic now since we need to stop attacking for those phases too. Not to mention the /yawn to interrupt... we didn't even debuffed him to slow his cast and his cast was alread slower than the &quot;debuff version&quot; could be and we all &quot;wtf?&quot;. Not to mention that he don't try to release aboms after the pull or back from green, only after using his 1st pot.<br />

Love the halfus changes, having 4 healers (1 disc) on 10 man heroic and still wiping within 1 minute due to tank deaths was no fun. Dragons really shouldn't hit for up to 55k when you need to have 2 on you at times (or 1 + boss + whelps). Especially when you run around with 30% healing reduction on average. <br />
The first heroics on 10 man shouldn't be a brick wall of this size, and I'm glad some retuning is being done.<br />
<br />
Or they should be on par with the last normal bosses? Heroic mode isn't a &quot;reset&quot;, it's a improvement over what you alread did. Unless your raid is alread decently geared for that and know what you're doing, but still having problems, than that could be the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like it or not guilds like mine dont run icc/black temple difficult raids until they they get the nerfs or the luck of the noob buff. I already did the hard raids in vanilla and BC i dont want to do the hardcore scene anymore. <br />
<br />
In order for a guild like mine to clear all the raid bosses right now willingly (we could probably put together a crew to clear all this current stuff but really just dont want to.) they all need to be nerfed down to about SSC level. which means to a level where about 8 good players in your raid can carry 2 not so great players who you refuse to leave behind just because blizzard tells you you have to.<br />
<br />
So, minus the nerfs or the ICC buff, if the bosses now stay about as hard as they are and all the bosses from here are out are just as hard? then a guild like mine is done raiding WoW.<br />
<br />
we will run kara and nax 2.0 and ZG and aq20 and UBRS and Ony, the raids most of you call jokes, because thats the level we want to play on and should be allowed to. And if blizz doesnt make these current bosses kinda like those, or whip out a Kara entry level raid type instance, then I guess we have no choice but to start checking out other games.<br />
<br />
<br />
so its really up to blizzard. make raids for the top 5-10% only and watch the other 90% go play rift or give the 90% something to raid too.</div></div><hr />

I disagree. It means that Halfus' abilities stay at full strength for longer. So for instance, if you get the Nova Drake, you'll be eating Novas over the whole raid till you kill it.

They didn't like to hear that 10-mans were harder because they had an ego about 25-mans being the &quot;real deal&quot;, and thus they were not. Some of the hard modes were nearly unbeatable without BiS and some really-really lucky RNG. <br />
<br />
This is what happens though because Blizzard didn't take enough 10-man raiding guilds into the beta to test, taking in more 25-man guilds who either tested just 25-mans, or just tried to slam 10-man raiding guilds by saying 10-man modes were easy, yet they failed or didn't even try them, thus Blizzard didn't test them thoroughly.<br />
<br />
It's about time they fixed that stupid haste bug, it has been going on since Wrath basically, and was annoying as hell. It was just that supposedly they couldn't see it internally, and when they finally got to trying it via retail observation they finally listened.</div></div><hr />

No no no no no. WRONG. Either you missreaded it, or you dont understand the encounter.<br />
Anyway, this change doesnt really change the way you must do this fight. You still need to free multiple drakes to nullify nasty side effects (super fast shadow nova, super fast fireballs, attack speed buff) but the only things that changes is that the boss receives the %damage debuffs when the drakes are KILLED, and not when they are UP and set free.

We thought nefarian was alot more doable than halfus was. With nefarian there are tactics to be executed well, and that takes learning. On halfus the tanks could die out of nowhere unless you ran with 3 tanks and 4 healers. No amount of learning can prevent oneshots.<br />
<br />
Now, in this log were still learning and had 4 things pulled, but this still shouldn't happen.<br />

It wasn't always the burst that did it. But if a drake or whelp pack can pull out between 15-25k dps on a tank if you're unlucky, yeah.. Good luck healing that when there's 2 of those on 1 tank, and 1 + the boss on the other tank, with a raid that's taking some damage aswell. The healing reduction doesn't help at all either.<br />
<br />

@Conclave: 2 more seconds on windblast precast won't change so much. If you now didn't managed to see where it comes, two more seconds won't allow you to do now. And yeah I know, sometimes we still wipe due to terrible windblasts at the beginning, but not very often. The reduced debuff does not affect anything at all, since at the first stormshield noone has too much stacks even with 10% more damage as it was to die within the stormshield.<br />

That's not why they suck. They suck becuase they're trying to pass off a nerf to our hp generation as a &quot;bug fix&quot;. They suck becuase they're such bad liars.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh the vast majority of those &quot;nerfs&quot; were fixes to make the encounters even possible.<br />
<br />
If you were actually doing Heroic raids, you'd understand they were needed. This isn't dumbing the game down or an attempt to knock your self worth, it was to bring down the blatant and obvious overtuning and to allow 10 man guilds to actually progress. Did you ever wonder why all the top guilds did all the firsts on 25 man, the so called &quot;harder of the two&quot;? Disregarding that a few of them are actually easier, several of the 10 man Heroic counterparts were *impossible* to kill.<br />
<br />
<br />
World first regular kills were done in leveling greens and blues.<br />
<br />
No they weren't? They were done in normal/heroic dungeon blues along with crafted and reputation epics. Those guys were running normal dungeons and getting gear before most of us were level 83. Never understood why people have to attempt to play up the top guilds. I'm sure a few of them may have had the odd green (ie: wands), but to say they were a guild full of greens and blues, is hilariously wrong.</div></div><hr />

It's you who don't know what you are talking about. They did not have time to gear up because they had to raid the first (euro) lockout of cata. They did kill a couple of bosses in greens and blues.</div></div><hr />
