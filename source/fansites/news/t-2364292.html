Few additional details on the new Legendary token:<br />
We've just pushed a hotfix live that makes Wakening Essences drop for everyone, regardless of whether you're on the quest or not. We'll also be dramatically increasing both the number of Essences required to purchase tokens and the rate at which you gain them in Patch 7.3.5. The overall time investment needed to purchase a token will stay roughly the same, but this will minimize the benefits of stockpiling Essences ahead of time.<br />
Note: Emissary bags earned prior to the release of 7.3.5 will still give pre-7.3.5 numbers of Essences. There is no benefit to saving Emissary bags until afer the patch. We also plan to add Wakening Essences to your first Battleground win of the day in 7.3.5. The tokens are bind on pickup because we don't want to overly encourage players to farm Essences on alt characters in order to feed Legendary items to their mains. However, if you purchase and use a token on a character that already has all of the available legendaries for their class, you will be given a random BoA token for another class.</div></div><hr />

Just how many players have managed to get all their class legendaries for a character, though? And random BoA token is still random. =/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because people can obtain them now and some people have 400+ <br />
<br />
The increase in drop rate is when 7.3.5 comes out to migate stocking up</div></div><hr />

I am happy they are making it harder to stockpile. Gives an unfair advantage to those that have the quest and can. I can not stockpile because all my leggos are at 1000 and can not pick up the quest anymore making it impossible to stockpile and I am sure many other players are in the same situation that I am.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you could gain say 200 until that patch hits live at the current rate and then the rate changes to 10x the previous rate and the cost for a token is not 175 but say 1750, you will have gained the majestic 1/10th of a token by stockpiling which is not very impressive. Do you understand now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Increasing the cost for the new token from 175 to whatever new cost is okay imo if they scale the same with the new rate. <br />
<br />
(Let's say a token will cost 1750 essences, and 7.3.5 emmisary give 50 essences instead of 5 now)</div></div><hr />

Who said that? They will probably just increase the amount needed for the upgrade token by the same multiplier...the only thing that changes is you might as well upgrade legendary items before the patch because those essences will lose a ton of value. I *hope* I'm wrong but that would be a Blizzard thing to do...</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you should... you know... farm them on your alt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know what you mean. But I don't have the time to play a second main. That's it. <br />
<br />
I don't understand why I can't be possible for us (at this point in the xpansion) to have at least a token which is just BoA and will give that character a legendary which openes it.<br />
<br />
I already got three tokens on my main (has all legendarys for his class) and it was three times a different class I will never play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because then people will complain about having to stuff their entire inventory with caches and being &quot;forced by blizz&quot; to grind their brains out for insta leggos on patch day. This makes that pretty much impossible to discourage people from feeling forced into terrible gameplay (that they choose for themselves but blame Blizzard for).</div></div><hr />

Complicated? It's pretty much simplified. Don't farm now, wait for 7.3.5, buy legendaries. In what world is that complicated?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ImpTaimer</div><div class="date">2018-01-09, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All these poor delusion people that still think skill and effort are an important factor in an RNG driven game. Especially with this half-assed Diablo 3 mechanics added to the game. In Diablo 3 the amount of time you spend on your main or your alt carries to all your characters rather than locking you into one. This should've been the case with Legion and Artifacts (at 110). More daily restrictions should've been applied to characters to prevent multi-character farming. Leveling your character to 110 and gear drops (maybe some achievements) are the only thing alts should be required to do separately.<br />
<br />
Remember last time they said old emissary caches wouldn't carry over and they lied? Like every single time they said it wouldn't? Expect the same shit to happen again.</div></div><hr />

We'll also be dramatically increasing both the number of Essences required to purchase tokens and the rate at which you gain them in Patch 7.3.5.

Balancing your game around people who have nothing better to do with their time is not exactly a smart way to balance your game.<br />
<br />
Plus, I didn't see anyone bitching about this when it was gold in Garrisons in WoD other than the fact it was the only thing to do. Legendaries are just a power increase with talents attached to them, stop acting like they are some uber special hyper awesome k00l beans system when in reality it's poorly designed RNG trying to recreate a feeling that never really existed in the first place, which in turn only causes more and more frustration.<br />

I have 3 legendaries on my main, so clearly there is a fundamental difference in play time as a contributing factor as someone who is generally casual with the side of RP.

I have read this same type of comment and I still do not understand what advantage this is giving over anyone else? So an alt gets to have a few legos faster than someone else's alt? Really? It is a freaking alt... now if someone was wanting to main change at this point in the expansion, being able to gather essences now to get 2-3 legos when 7.3.5 comes out is actually a really nice boost to the character progression and HARMS NOBODY. Recall that they are not increasing the number of legos you can equip, so regardless if they gave you every lego for your spec on release, it would still not do anything to negatively impact anyone else; it would actually improve the option of playing alts.<br />
<br />
But seriously, what advantage would it give someone if they could buy 2-3 legos when 7.3.5 on release day over anyone else that has been playing their main for over a year now...</div></div><hr />

We have had 3 currencies drop from all these sources now, a 4th won't hurt. And a 4th would instantly have fixed all issues with the already obtained ones, heck the first 2 points of the post would have been fixed with just making a new currency.<br />
<br />
And people will most likely say something like &quot;Yeah but they don't want to have to many currencies on the tab&quot;, blizzard clearly doesn't care to much for that, considering the illidan soul prism thingies are also still there.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, thanks for that. It really is fun getting 3 tokens in a row for classes i don't have, they look pretty awesome in my bags. What's the purpose of this RNG? Is it an encouragement to make us play more classes or what? I just don't get it.</div></div><hr />

Its over for whom? For 5% of the whole community who have already cleared AtBT and have 6 fully geared alts? 95% of the community haven't cleared shit yet, nor they own 6 alts which are geared better than average. Of course you're right, why would they care bringing another rng aspect in Legion since they've done it over and over again but still this shit is so random and stupid. I mean at least they will implement that catch up mechanic, so i am glad we will have the chance to gear our alts way quicker but those random tokens don't make sense at all.</div></div><hr />

how does this help target the legendary you want? (hint: it doesn't) ... its still a random leggo or a random boa token for a random class. No targeting of specific leggos here...</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is just doubling down with the retarded RNG shit like they always do with any problem which community bring up even during countless Betas. Why not just keep the token prices low and let ppl complete their legendaries. Hell make them BoA so you can feed any alt you like to play. We are at the end of the expansion already. Why would it matter? I know plenty of ppl who would return to the game in a heartbeat if this Legendary shit wasn't this retarded. Even if they are not so prominent with the spec you like to play, biggest hype killer when you plan to play a different class mid. expansion is the existence of legendaries.<br />
<br />
But they won't admit that this shit is retarded as always. We are gonna hear them say like 2 years from now that this system was a mistake which will be meaningless. They never fix shit when it matters the most. They always double down.</div></div><hr />

Simple. You get good gear (not legendarys) fairly easy and fast. The only thing holding you back from performing excellent are the legendarys.</div></div><hr />

They just doubled the amout of legendaries you get if you play your character. I dont even know why you play this game if you want legendaries on characters that you dont even play? Just so it would look cool to have best in game legendaries for something you dont play? I'm pretty sure there are plenty of people who would pop up to the game for 1 month if they would be given free gear. Blizzard actually wants to support players not subsrcibers who only pay for getting something. I think its pretty fucking cool that they have so much money that they dont have to support the community that wants fast win and fast gear.<br />
<br />
They already said that if they would implement the legendary system they would do it differently because of all the mistakes in it. You are so fucking clueless that I dont even believe you play this game anymore or if you play you log in maybe once a week. Just move on with your fucking life like all your friends did.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why I can't be possible for us (at this point in the xpansion) to have at least a token which is just BoA and will give that character a legendary which openes it.<br />

I already got three tokens on my main (has all legendarys for his class) and it was three times a different class I will never play.<br />

But he probably can farm essences easier on his main. That Legendary token should be BOA and everyone would be fine with it.<br />

Not really, BIS legendaries were giving people big(relative) advantage. And their drop was so much randomized that you could get 2 BISes in one week or not get any bis for 2 months or so... I don't think that so much RNG should be a main factor how good you perform. Because without BIS legendaries you're not going to do more DPS than people on the same level with BISes.<br />
<br />
After receiving legendary most people had two reactions: relief that they get their bis legendary or frustration that they didn't get BIS legendary.<br />
<br />
Why people who do emissary quests 7 days a week should get best item for their class and someone who does mythic raiding shouldn't? Of course that's a little hyperbole, but casuals in my guild were receiving BIS legendaries, while mythic raiding team weren't. Why? That's unfair for me. <br />
<br />
If you do not put enough effort(learn boss tactics, cooperate with your team, min/max your character etc.) - you shouldn't get best items in the game. Simple as that. Why casuals who do other things that M+ or raiding should get legendaries anyway? So they could do their world quests/LFR faster? That's a nonsense. I have nothing against casuals of course, but I don't see a reason why they should have the same chance for getting BEST items in the game as people who do mythics. That's all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I swear a few years ago people werent so delusional, arrogant to the definition of playing video games, and entitled to everything that in the game's code.<br />
<br />
I agree, but in that case people have arguments against legendaries. And I totally agree with them. Saying that &quot;I don't want them to be BOA&quot; is even more arrogant and egocentric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the get go for starters, getting a legendary boa token so you can choose what you want.<br />
Make all the legendaries like the heirlooms tab. Once you obtain one you can use it on all your characters. <br />
I say this since the legendary models aren't new or unique, they're older models so nothing visual to obtain. We can't use them beyond legion for the unique affixes. There's no unique questline that makes them special. You farm your butt off or get lucky to get them so it's already a meh system in general. They're not that uncommon when you're playing a lot. When players get a crap legendary, or one they aren't looking to get, they get mad, frustrated and discouraged. This alleviates that.<br />
Since there's so many legendaries to get across all toons and specs, making it so you get what you want once and done feels like a better system.</div></div><hr />

Doing less dps =/= unplayable. You are using extreme hyperboles to make it look dramatic, but its laughable in the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you do not put enough effort(learn boss tactics, cooperate with your team, min/max your character etc.) - you shouldn't get best items in the game. <br />

Exactly. So hop on that alt and put enough effort to get the best items you seek.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree, but in that case people have arguments against legendaries. And I totally agree with them. Saying that &quot;I don't want them to be BOA&quot; is even more arrogant and egocentric.<br />
<br />
This thread isnt about legendaries, but new way to acquire them in 7.3.5. Saying &quot;I want them to be boa, let me farm them on my super geared main so that i can flood my alts with legendaries (just a thought about it sounds RIDICULOUS for someone who's been playing since tbc)&quot; is being lazy af.</div></div><hr />

I don't have any guarantee that I'm going to get best items for my alt. If I was doing mythic runs on my alt then I could expect getting best gear... but by grinding? You call that effort? Only special snowflakes who play 24/7 could only say such a thing.<br />

<br />
First of all - it's also thread about legendaries. They were bad idea(see my previous post why), so I think that everyone should get their bis legendaries at the start. That would be most fairest, because everyone would have equal chances.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HuxNeva</div><div class="date">2018-01-09, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We've just pushed a hotfix live that makes Wakening Essences drop for everyone, regardless of whether you're on the quest or not.<br />
Ya--<br />
<br />
We'll also be dramatically increasing both the number of Essences required to purchase tokens and the rate at which you gain them in Patch 7.3.5. The overall time investment needed to purchase a token will stay roughly the same, but this will minimize the benefits of stockpiling Essences ahead of time.<br />
--ay...<br />
<br />
The tokens are bind on pickup because we don't want to overly encourage players to farm Essences on alt characters in order to feed Legendary items to their mains. However, if you purchase and use a token on a character that already has all of the available legendaries for their class, you will be given a random BoA token for another class.<br />
Just how many players have managed to get all their class legendaries for a character, though? And random BoA token is still random. =/<br />
<br />
I have all the mage legendaries. Never 'farmed' for them, but I hardly play any alts. Cleared current raid every week on N/HC (this is where most of them dropped) , emissaries most of the time, but not religiously say like 70%, and I do love to run M+</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you for not simply starting to rant and acting serious and intelligent!<br />
<br />
My whole point is just that the extra token you can get is simply for a random class rather then you being able to chose the class not more not less I don't want to have my ass pumped full of leggos...</div></div><hr />
