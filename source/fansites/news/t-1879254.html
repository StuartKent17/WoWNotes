Patch 6.2.3 Preview<br />
Patch 6.2.3 is on the way, bringing some changes to hold us over until Legion: <br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm dungeons are getting Timewalking: Grim Batol, Stonecore, Lost City of Tol’vir, The Vortex Pinnacle, Throne of Tides, and End Time<br />
Pit of Saron and Magister’s Terrace are also getting Timewalking.<br />
An Infinite Dragonflight mount (Infinite Timereaver) has a chance to drop from any Timewalking dungeon boss.<br />
Cross-Realm Mythic Raiding will be enabled.<br />
Valor has returned! It is earned from Heroic and Mythic Dungeons, various Bonus Events, and your first Raid Finder run each week. <br />
Mythic dungeons will be the most lucrative source of Valor.<br />
Mythic dungeons can drop a Heirloom Trinket that will scale to level 110.<br />
Items can be upgraded by 10 item levels.<br />
Defeating Archimonde on Heroic difficulty or higher will reward the Grove Warden (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128422-grove-warden) mount (for a limited time)!<br />
Mythic Warforged items can be even higher item level now, anywhere from 685 to 725 in five item-level increments.<br />
Baleful items can also be higher item level, anywhere from level 655 all the way to 695.<br />
Warlords Season 3 is coming, with Warmongering Aspirant gear at PvP item level 715, Warmongering Combatant gear at 730, and Warmongering Gladiator gear at 740.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 6.2.3 will be making its way onto the PTR soon, and we wanted to provide you with some insights on what it has in store.<br />
<br />
We’ve made no secret of our desire to expand the role and importance of dungeons in World of Warcraft as we move full speed ahead toward Legion. We look forward to sharing more of our plans in that regard during BlizzCon 2015 next month. At the same time, we’ve heard from many players that they wanted more reasons to run dungeons in Warlords, so we’re pleased to announce this small patch, which is focused on reinforcing the reward systems around our existing dungeons as well as expanding the scope of the Timewalking feature that we introduced in patch 6.2.<br />
<br />
Timewalk With Me: New Timewalking Dungeons<br />
Get ready to go back in time to experience six iconic dungeons from Cataclysm with this new Timewalking bonus event. You’ll be able to face the foes within Grim Batol, Stonecore, Lost City of Tol’vir, The Vortex Pinnacle, Throne of Tides, and End Time once more and reap the treasures within.<br />
<br />
To round out our Timewalking journey, we’ll also be adding the Pit of Saron to the Wrath of the Lich King Timewalking bonus event and the Magister’s Terrace to the Burning Crusade Timewalking bonus event.<br />
<br />

<br />
Lest we forget, there’s just one more bit of news that’s bound to draw you into the vortex to do a little Timewalking. Players will now have a chance to loot a rare Infinite Timereaver mount from any Timewalking boss.<br />
<br />
Developer Insights<br />
One of the most common requests we’ve heard ever since introducing Timewalking was for there to be some way to obtain an Infinite Dragonflight mount, since it’d fit perfectly with the theme of time manipulation, aside from being just plain cool-looking. We agree. Inspired by Murozond, the final boss of the End Time dungeon that is included in the Cataclysm Timewalking rotation, the Infinite Timereaver will be a rare drop from any dungeon boss during all of the Timewalking events.<br />
<br />

<br />
Cross-Realm Mythic Raiding<br />
With the patch we’ll also be introducing Cross-Realm Mythic Raiding. You’ll now be able to join with friends, fill that one last spot, or have an easier time recruiting to backfill missing raid slots, allowing you to take on some of the most difficult encounters in Warlords of Draenor. <br />
<br />
Valor for the Valorous<br />
With the patch we’ll be bringing back Valor as a currency. You’ll will be able earn Valor once more by taking part in Heroic and Mythic Dungeons, from various Bonus Events, and via the first run through Raid Finder each week. To upgrade, visit your friendly neighborhood ethereal to upgrade gear up to five item levels at a time, up to two times per piece of gear.<br />
<br />
Developer Insights<br />
Dungeon content shines when its difficulty is appropriate to players’ power level, so Mythic dungeons will be the most lucrative source of Valor for players who have items from Tanaan or Hellfire Citadel. For those who are still gearing up to tackle Mythic dungeons, or who prefer to use queued matchmaking, Raid Finder wings and the first Heroic dungeon each day will also provide Valor, as will most of Seer Kazal’s weekly event quests. Ethereal Voidbinders have made their way through time and space to Stormshield and Warspear, as well as returning to Orgrimmar and Stormwind, to allow players to use this Valor to upgrade their gear by up to 10 item levels. We decided to go with item upgrades rather than a Valor vendor because item upgrades offer power that complements items from other sources rather than competing with them. <br />
<br />
Gift of the Grove Warden<br />
Soon, players who dare to face the fearsome might of Archimonde will receive an added bonus. For a limited time, defeating Archimonde on Heroic difficulty or higher will reward players with a mysterious fragment of dark power that begins a quest. When you bring this fragment to the druids of Moonglade, you’ll learn a little more about what’s in store for Azeroth, and the druids will give you a majestic Grove Warden mount in thanks for your efforts. This quest won’t be available forever—our current plan is to retire the quest in an update some time before Legion’s launch, so grab some friends and head to Hellfire Citadel while you can.<br />

<br />
More Bigger Better: Item Rewards<br />
We’re expanding the range of item quality for players within Mythic Dungeons and Tanaan Jungle. Players who take part in Mythic Dungeons will have a chance to gain items up to item level 725, and players who receive Baleful items will now have a chance to gain items up to item level 695. Players in Mythic Dungeons will also now have a chance to loot a new Heirloom Trinket that will scale to level 110.<br />
<br />
Developer Insights<br />
Running a dungeon is a bit more exciting when there’s a chance you might get a direct item upgrade, versus simply earning a predictable amount of currency per run. Thus, we’re also expanding the power of Warforged items in Mythic dungeons—rather than a static +20 item level bonus when a Mythic dungeon item is Warforged, there will be a chance for even greater increases in power. The very luckiest players might even obtain item level 725 versions of the dungeon drops, with increasingly better odds of 720, 715, and so forth, fully spanning the range from 685 to 725 in five item-level increments. We’re also applying this system to Baleful items from Tanaan itself, which can now range in quality from item level 655 all the way to 695. Raiding, crafting, and PvP will remain the most reliable sources of the best gear available, but we’d like to create the chance for surprise when you’re adventuring out in the world or in dungeons. <br />
<br />
Arena Season 3<br />
We’re also preparing to end Warlords Arena Season 2 and transition to Warlords Arena Season 3. We’ll have more details to share on this transition between seasons and the distribution of rewards in the near future.<br />
<br />
Developer Insights<br />
With Arena Season 3 we’ll be introducing new gear, including Warmongering Aspirant gear at PvP item level 715, Warmongering Combatant gear at 730, and Warmongering Gladiator gear at 740.<br />
<br />
Make sure you keep an eye out for the complete patch, 6.2.3 notes and we’ll look forward to seeing you on the Public Test Realm.<br />

Timewalking still is. It's just adding more dungeons to the rotation. You don't have to do them if you don't wanna. Also it's one mount out of like 500/600 I'm sure you can still get your achievement.</div></div><hr />

You'll have a lot of time yet to progress on it. The PTR for the patch may or may not start before Blizzcon, then the patch itself (a new pvp season is mentioned, which means ~20 weeks of time in the patch at least), then the Legion prepatch... that's, at the very least, 6 months. A lot can happen in 6 months, starting with you progressing Archi, because upgrades, up to and including Heroic boosts becoming really, really cheap (they're not exactly expensive even now, can get them for 70-80K gold easily on my realm at least).</div></div><hr />

mythic dungeon into a grind ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic dungeons are probably less forgiving for inattentiveness than H HFC. (i.e. if you stand in fire for 2 seconds on H HFC... a healer can probably save you,) whereas standing in fire for even just 2 seconds on Mythic Dungeon and you're toast.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard (and many raiding guilds) are in trouble due to people leaving, raiding mythic is hard when you have people quitting on you right?<br />
<br />
I wonder if Blizzard thought the solution to that is just to kill the purpose of raiding with this patch? <br />
Now we should focus on doing Mythic dungeons (you know that gear + valor) and focus on doing them events and timewalking stuff! <br />
Oh and ofc, the best solution - Cross-realm mythic raiding eh! <br />
Because we definitely didn't want people actually I dunno, creating a community within a guild or having people that we can calendar invite. ~<br />
Let's join hands folks, and cross-realm pug mythic raid content with our new-found mythic dungeon gear! ;)<br />
<br />
- Beats the selfie camera patch tho -</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well been waiting for something like this to pop up. Maybe it would of been better to get another shop mount or a pet or even a service reduction to prop up the numbers. A lot of people have had their fill of doing to same content, which I find amazing since there been so many people bitching about 14 month of having to do SoO.<br />
<br />
The only people left in this game at this point are those that will hold on to the bitter end, no matter what and those that still are proceeding through current raid content.

I suspect that it will be sold for less than 20k after time. Its so easy boss to carry 10 people at a time.<br />
But whats sure for now is that legion is 6+month from now on. Since we are currently middle of pvp season and new one is coming when the shortest season ever was 4months.<br />
Glad this game is free to play nowadays, otherwise their subs would plummet.<br />
<br />
This basically all but assures us that Legion isn't until May at the earliest. Pretty bad imo. Theyre trying to give people other stuff to do but raid until legion comes out. The item upgrade system should have never left either. However I would prefer a gold sink as there's too much of it in the world over valor coming back. Either Way all these changes only make it better for my alt mage but Now I'll have to consider putting her on the back burner until I get the valor needed for my main's item level upgrades.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how I feel about the Infinite Drake being a reskinned wind drake, without the white crackles and sparkle effects the normal infinite drakes have, but I suppose it's still very cool looking.<br />
More timewalking isn't bad. I'm after those badges for the mounts, so no complaints.<br />
I don't care too much about item level, so all those upgrades mean little to me.<br />
Not sure how I feel about Valor returning after Blizz was so happy to be rid of it.<br />
<br />
Ah well, overall I am positive about this addition! Much better than nothing until 7.0.</div></div><hr />

I wish Warforged items were equivalent to items being upgrade x times, but not increase the ilvl cap of an item. So if an item was originally 625, Warforged to 633, it could be upgraded one more time to 635 (equivalent to being fully upgraded by 10 ilvl). This would allow Warforged to be a happy bonus, but not devalue non-Warforged items (since they are potentially equivalent in the end).</div></div><hr />

Anyone who thought Legion would be released sooner than maybe April wasn't thinking. Beta will run at least 4 months, and I very highly doubt we'll see it until after Blizzcon.

<br />
You know people were hopeful since it was announced in August. But you're absolutely right in terms of a release area. As far as doing meaningful stuff again...yea I won't be against doing that stuff on my main now...but I just feel like now I have to do it to get valor....Unless raid bosses also give valor(which this doesn't state they do) and if there is a weekly amount. While I know they want people TO do dungeons, I feel like they should let you get 60-70% of the cap from raids and the rest from dungeons. I would prefer to do the dungeons on alts that could actually use the gear.</div></div><hr />

Evidently 705 ilvl isn't enough for freaking garrison invasions anymore, let alone mythic dungeons.

It's similar to when they increased the number of upgrades possible for items in MoP. Basically nerfing the current raid content by upping everyones ilvl by 10 instead of specifically targeting boss mechanics.<br />

Precisely my own reaction, though I'm not currently subbed. (I'm waiting around until I know when Legion will release, and then I'll probably resub to finish off a few things and level. I'm kinda done with WoD.) There's no real incentive to keep running dungeons, and that was a problem in this expansion. So hopefully that will get folks back in there.</div></div><hr />

It will probably go up when this patch hits but I don't imagine it will be very expensive after a few weeks. Once everyone on the raid team increases their ilvl by 10 more their carrying ability will be ridiculous. Maybe 20-30k? Pugging also might be relatively feasible as it's already possible and the increased stat power will just make it even easier. An upgraded warforged or gemmed heroic item in 6.2.3 will be slightly more powerful than the current mythic version of said item.</div></div><hr />

Soon, players who dare to face the fearsome might of Archimonde will receive an added bonus. For a limited time, defeating Archimonde on Heroic difficulty or higher will reward players with a mysterious fragment of dark power that begins a quest.

These changes are great! This is very clearly shows Blizzard knowing they made mistakes, actually listening to player feedback, and making an honest effort to make things better rather than just burying their head in the sand until legion comes out who-knows-when... And on the subject of time-walking I for one had zero interest in it until they just added an INFINITE DRAGON MOUNT to the game as a reward. This is the dragon model I have always wanted to possess as a mount, so I am beyond happy.</div></div><hr />

I also have issues with the new loot system for mythic dungeons, Because you know mythic dungeons are totally as difficult to do as Mythic Gorefiend.

<br />
I think that it means that beta is relatively close. This patch is effectively the &quot;everyone go get your mythic kill&quot; sort of patch. Happens every expansion since Wrath and probably means we are nearly halfway through 6.2 being major content as Blizz has pretty much given up on anyone still progressing. We will probably see beta open soon after Blizzcon and then have 5-7 months until Legion launch (early-mid summer).</div></div><hr />

im not ungratefull for the effort made by blizz just seems a waste of an event to &quot;me&quot; would rather get a group together travel there and have a few laughs.. oh yeah dont want it on the lfd would rather find people ... plus it would kick some life back into the general chat channels :)<br />

I think they're doing that to try and grow the pool of Mythic raiders, at least gearwise, because right now the #1 complaint for mythic guilds across the bar is a decided lack of talent/geared folks/applicants/etc., which, combined with the 20-man requirement, is an absolute death sentence.<br />

Our issue isn't gear, we can gear a new recruit in near full HC in one night. Issue is always people, not gear or iLevel bloat. There's just not enough people around anymore. Especially people that can handle mechanics.<br />
<br />
I don't like the iLevel bloat going on. As it stands I can replace 7 non Tier piece items with the PvP 730 ones when the patch hits to help push through Mythic. Never mind 730 Weapons from PvP, as opposed to 720 for the Lower floor of Mythic HFC :/<br />
<br />
Even if I upgrade my Mythic 720 weapons from the lower floor; the stats aren't great and the PvP 730's will probably be better there as well. :(<br />

I suspect you're probably right about the motivations, though they seem to be misplaced. The same people who think they merely need 725 gear to kill mythic gorefiend are the same people who will never kill mythic gorefiend.</div></div><hr />

Q3 must have been another massive drop in sub numbers. So now they resort to getting more free gear, mounts and upgrades while flipflopping on changes like valor to do it.

Agreed, it feels so odd. Especially since it's just do damn good at base iLevel as well. I for one will be running Arenas and Ashran ASAP to get some 730 weapons and non-tier piece items to help push through Mythic quicker.<br />

I just hope the daggers and set items look nice, so far they've been very lazy and just offering some slight PvE recolours.</div></div><hr />

They didnt do apexis crystals because they know people have them coming out their ass right now with nothing to spend them on cause the gear you get is garbage from them. If they did that then people would just upgrade most of gear right out of the gate and then would unsub once again with nothing to do. With the reintroduction of valor.. you have to start the grind at square 1.</div></div><hr />

iLevel doesn't make a mythic raider. Most people try, and we have 2-3 trials every two weeks. They keep failing mechanics ,despite having gear. I doubt this is going to do more bar bloat ilevel, and force people to endlessly grind dungeons again.<br />

Also, anyone confused on Valor its a simple reasoning. We have tons of Apexis and they don't want you to be able walk over to the upgrade guy and max all your gear out. So it was either make it an obscene amount of Apexis to upgrade or re-add another currency. The latter being the smarter choice.<br />
<br />
I really want that mount from timewalking though (love dragons, I'm 32 and they are just part of high fantasy for me...fuck you), but the moose is a moose. Thankfully maybe it will provoke my Canadian raid friends to come back. Is that racist?</div></div><hr />

I hazard a guess that it'll serve as a quick gear catch up for people to take into Legion, which will also get more people into PvP. I don't see an issue with it. The gear will be outdated as you level to 110. I still won't step foot in PvP though. It's been horrible since MoP.</div></div><hr />

The people who understand &quot;ilevel doesn't make a mythic raider&quot; are not mythic raiders.

Simple statistics would dictate that there are bound to be people who do understand that Mythic raiding is more than ilvl but aren't in it for x, y, z, reasons. Taking away the ilvl requirement while at the same time giving equivalent gear through alternative means can only increase the pool of potential raiders as well as passively &quot;nerfing&quot; content by increasing stats/decreasing threats.<br />
<br />
By these arguments, anybody who isn't a mythic raider now would never be one. Which, unless you're a delusional turd, you know is complete bollocks.</div></div><hr />

Can you please calm down? They already said Tanaan and HFC was the last content patch for WoD months ago. This isn't them pretending the patch to be anything that it isn't and they're basically done with WoD. They said it's a &quot;small patch.&quot;<br />
<br />
TBH, this patch is better than the selfie cam one.<br />
<br />
Grinding does kind of suck, but only when the rewards are meaningless. This gives me some stuff to do and some goals. I haven't bothered with ilvl since I'm basically stuck in mid heroic HFC due to my guild falling apart over WoD's suckiness.</div></div><hr />

Adding really easy near mythic level gear and increasing item levels may bring up the uncommon player who is in a shit guild but wants to move up and can't get the time of the day. But for the most part all it will do is cause i lvl bloat. There are alot of bad players out there who could be given full BIS and still not be prepared for Mythic raiding regardless of whether they think they are or not. Shit my guild has had 1-2 people on the roster in the past that really don't have any business being there but we couldn't find a replacement that could even out do them.</div></div><hr />

Idk why everyone else is raging. More timewalking dungeons, actual reason to do mythic/heroic dungeons for mythic raiding progression with ilvl boosts. Infinite dragon mount to chase as well as another heirloom trinket, and my favorite moose mount that I shall ride everywhere is obtainable in game (what now, naysayers on store mounts only?) and a possible non-static mythic raid id with cross realm enabled? Yea. I'm game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zrankfappa</div><div class="date">2015-10-14, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I disagree. Pure statistics dictate that there are bound to be people who do understand that Mythic raiding is more than ilvl but aren't in it for x, y, z, reasons.<br />
<br />
By these arguments, anybody who isn't a mythic raider now would never be one. Which, unless you're a delusional turd, you know is complete bollocks.<br />
<br />
you don't have to be a mythic raider if your ilvl provides enough of a crutch, isn't that the point of the valor upgrades?</div></div><hr />

Uh, this is a 6.2.3 preview, afaik it isn't on the PTR yet, which means we won't see 6.2.3 until December. If there is a pre launch event before April I would be shocked. in reality this patch is probably intended to keep people busy for 6 months, and then in late summer there might be a pre launch event with an early fall expac release.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I see that there are now PTR patch notes ...</div></div><hr />

Although not perfect it still seems at least they are trying to throw some things at the wall see what sticks, even if it was a system that was present before. They really have nothing to lose except more subs with trying these things out to see if that is something they will want to keep for Legion.<br />
-Valor upgrades<br />
-Adding dungeons to timewalking (Cata woohoo, although P.o.S.? )<br />
-Making dungeons relevant<br />
-Making mythic dungeons relevant<br />
-Cross Realm Mythic<br />
-Mooooooose mount not a shop mount<br />
-Making a rare mount a drop (even if it is a reskin) from timewalking<br />
<br />
Either way, enjoy it for at least another 4-6 months before we see anything Legion Related hit the PTR<br />

Was that exact interview. He said it wasn't tied to the date and would be coming out around that time. So may to july is what they're shooting for. But we all know it will be fall.

Now that you speak of it, I'm curious. It could be interesting to have max-crafted gear being upgradable with Valor.<br />

Your life doesn't need to revolve around the game to do a few Mythic dungeons. Just do it when the dungeon holiday is on, it's easy to get a spot and you don't need to be armed to the teeth to do well.

Just do one every week or something. I doubt it will be that rare and they take a few minutes more than a heroic does to complete. Really the only difference between heroic and mythic is you need a group and sometimes you might have to cc or interrupt.</div></div><hr />

You do know the only reason it's becoming x realm is because the tier is out half a year soon and it's becoming old.<br />

<br />
Yep. My first reaction was &quot;Legion is delayed&quot;. They're panicking. Subs must be dropping like a rock, and heroic and above raiding must be falling apart to put a carrot like the moose in there. On top of all that, why not wait a month and give this out at Blizzcon? Or wait for legion to give cross realm mythic? Make sure it's working perfectly, etc.? <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, they're panicking. The only time they listen to players is when they've started to lose large numbers of them.</div></div><hr />

They don't suck, because they're things that should never have been removed.<br />

This patch is more repudiation for the geniuses in the WoW team who gutted the game and thought players would be fine with it. There must be some severely butthurt devs who were forced to bring this stuff back.<br />

I'm pretty excited about this. Idk why everyone else is raging. More timewalking dungeons, actual reason to do mythic/heroic dungeons for mythic raiding progression with ilvl boosts. Infinite dragon mount to chase as well as another heirloom trinket, and my favorite moose mount that I shall ride everywhere is obtainable in game (what now, naysayers on store mounts only?) and a possible non-static mythic raid id with cross realm enabled? Yea. I'm game.<br />
<br />
Nobody is &quot;raging&quot;. I think most of the comments are a mixture of amusement and disgust at their blatant acts of desperation to retain players.<br />

<br />
I think this indicates the absolute end of an expansion, next patch i assume would be around xmas/january and that will Legion pre-launch event patch :)<br />
<br />
Like these changes, more stuff to work on os always nice, more paths to progress a character are always welcome by me.<br />
<br />
If you're expecting the Legion prepatch in January, you are going to be very, very, very unhappy in January.</div></div><hr />

It's 20 weeks minimum which is about five months. But it definitely lines it up perfectly for basically a year of HFC....I don't think Legion will be out before May 2016, and that's assuming they get their shit together and get the beta out sooner than later. Really all I care about for legion is it isn't like WoD...The fact that WoD got delayed enormous lengths and still is overall shit is bad. Really they should have done three tiers this expansion to buy time for Legion.</div></div><hr />

They've been this way for years now and it's finally catching up to them. I'm okay with this though because either some people get fired and the game gets taken in a better direction or they destroy it and they're forced to shut down World of Warcraft. Maybe bring back Warcraft as an RTS or perhaps even turn it into an RPG.</div></div><hr />

It will probably be on the store when 6.2.3 launches and you can do heroic archimonde as a alternate to real money</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if this isn't the case, the simple solution would be:<br />
<br />
&quot;Missed your chance at the moose from heroic Archimonde? Good news! It'll be on the store once it's no longer on Archimonde.&quot;<br />
<br />
Which is a good compromise. Players who put the time and effort in get it free and early, players who don't can still get it for money later. Win-win.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aliok</div><div class="date">2015-10-14, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild is close to killing heroic arch, so I'm happy the mount will be exclusive to moderately skilled raid teams. That being said, I have a swift spectral tiger, so I don't see myself ever using it.<br />
<br />
The attitude of &quot;exclusivity is good&quot; really frustrates me. It is not healthy and feeds into the kind of behavior that is among the large reasons for the state of the community inside and outside the game. Yes, people sometimes need an impetus to participate in an activity and/or reward those who already do. I am not arguing against that (except in the case of School of Hard Knocks (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1786-school-of-hard-knocks) - Blizzard once claimed it was an incentive for players to try PvP but I think that was deleted when someone over there realized how stupid that statement was). There was a time when the attitude was that more dedicated (to use the word as a catch-all) players would experience and obtain current end-game stuff before the rest of the population, and that those players would be distinguishable from all others for a goodly period of time. BUT the content remained accessible, which was encouragement for less dedicated players to aspire to more. Then for the even less dedicated, there was the next expansion (or two) that would allow them to solo or duo the obsolete content. Everyone essentially got what they wanted.<br />
<br />
Very sadly, something changed over at Blizzard. The design attitude of &quot;the recognition of the difficulty overcome when it's current as its own reward and players can later come back to experience the content but without the attendant glory&quot; became &quot;lump every kind of player into this specific content and force them at our pace instead of their own and when all is said and done the content is removed regardless of the effect&quot; is all kinds of bad that I don't have the time to delve into, nor the inclination since I'm on a tablet, but which is evident by the end of &quot;Mists of Pandaria&quot; and nearly the entirety of the &quot;Warlords of Draenor&quot; experiences.<br />
<br />
So fine, put the mount behind heroic- and mythic-difficulty Archimonde kills. But don't make it a &quot;limited time only!&quot; deal. And don't tweet to make a joke about the number of players buying a &quot;moose carry (https://www.twitter.com/holinka/status/654311014712737792)&quot; - that's just... tasteless didn't begin to cover it for me.<br />

Unfortunate but necessary addendum:<br />
<br />
If you think &quot;casual&quot; and &quot;baddie whining because bad&quot; are arguments to use against this, kindly consider 1] it's my opinion and my emotional reaction is completely valid 2] not being a jerk and instead actually write why you disagree with my evaluation(s). If neither alternative option is palatable to you for whatever reason and you are dead set on flinging personal attacks that fail to add anything to the conversation, then use the third option, which is to go engage in self-copulation.</div></div><hr />

I'm not even sure why I bother myself. Even though the evidence is there, people refuse to realize how detrimental their attitude is toward the game. Subscription numbers will continue to drop and when Blizzard is forced to shut down World of Warcraft, they'll wonder what happened.

How is he a blight on the community? Some people are happy(I'm somewhere in between) with this patch. I honestly feel they should have planned for three tiers, and they should do so going forward per expansion. Make the first two last six months, and then 8 months for the last one(to give them time to get a quality beta period for the next expansion. But the point of the person you're quoting is spot on.

Being happy with the awful direction they're taking the game in does not give you the right to mock or insult others. That kind of destructive attitude is why both the community and game are falling apart. Those &quot;whiners&quot; exist because they're tired of Blizzard's poor decisions and they have every right to express that.

I honestly would not be surprised if they were 3 million or less subs on the next quarter call. Many guilds are having issues with filling mythic raids right now and recruiting is the biggest pain in the ass currently.</div></div><hr />

None. Just stupid people trying to over exaggerate things.<br />

overwatch beta start date is a terrible start date...hey lets drop this on the day one of the biggest franchises in gaming history drops their &quot;fifth&quot; game.<br />
<br />
Highly doubt they are releasing a BETA game to compete with a fully finished ready to release game. Plus the invites will be limited to I guess streamers who will spend the day streaming that.</div></div><hr />

Don't worry, it'll definitely be a store mount at some point. People-this community-is just being their basement dwelling, cheetofingers selves again.</div></div><hr />

The blue post says they were &quot;inspired&quot; by Murozond, but he and the rest of the Infinites are a special kind of deep black with white highlights and particles, not just a recolor. They should've just threw armor onto the actual Infinite Drake skin, like the Epoch Hunter from Escape from Durnholde Keep dungeon. I really hope it's cooler than that static image, otherwise I don't want another Nether Drake.<br />

(the highlights on this guy, including the blue wing tints, would be really cool on a mount as well, so I'm hoping there's more to the Timereaver than what we see)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does &quot;as item level increases&quot; mean? You have a lower chance at getting a 725 as YOUR ilevel increases, or each increment of +5 from 685-725 has a lower chance to drop?<br />
<br />
edit: I resend the question. Now that I reread it, its clearly the latter.</div></div><hr />

Could have at least put back the group finder and premade raid for it. So one doesn't have to spend 9 hours in the shithole to get 4 events and one boss done till 06.00 am.<br />
But no Blizzards feeds on players tears and unhappiness.<br />
Fuck the players as long as the execs can sleep on their money pillows.</div></div><hr />

I don’t mind the increase ilvl to help nerf content, that’s fine, but But I don’t want to have to run LFR or dungeons to get valor. And yes, I can chose not to, but then I am not helping be the best I can be to help my raid team.<br />

<br />
<br />
Well and to me the attitude of &quot;i want to have everything that other people have accessible at all times&quot; is even more frustrating. <br />
They announce it, you can now start preparing for getting the mount. Once the patch hits it is even easier to gear up for the task...there are plenty of random grps which kill Archimonde on a regular basis already and there will be more until the patch hits the live servers. And YES, it is a good thing that the drop is time limited. There should be more exclusive stuff like this, which motivates you to actually do things. Goals you can work on...instead of waiting for one or two more addons so you can farm it with a few friends or all by yourself. And you know blizzard. Limited time does not mean just 1 or 2 months. It probably will last until legion releases. So whats the freaking deal? You want it? Do something for it.</div></div><hr />

So basically stop people from playing more than 1 class out of the 11 playable and take away the freedom of being able to choose a faction in a game where there are 2 factions?. Sounds silly. And how would one more PvP server help when there are already PvP servers?.</div></div><hr />
