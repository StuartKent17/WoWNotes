Diablo at BlizzCon 2018<br />
BlizzCon 2018 is almost here and we’ve seen a lot of rumors flying around about our plans for Diablo at the show. These are very exciting times—we currently have multiple teams working on different Diablo projects and we can’t wait to tell you all about them . . . when the time is right.<br />
<br />
We know what many of you are hoping for and we can only say that “good things come to those who wait,” but evil things often take longer. We appreciate your patience as our teams work tirelessly to create nightmarish experiences worthy of the Lord of Terror.<br />
<br />
While we won’t be ready to announce all of our projects, we do intend to share some Diablo-related news with you at the show.<br />
<br />
November 2 will be an especially diabolical date—not only is it the first day of BlizzCon, it’s also when Diablo III arrives on the Nintendo Switch. If you’re planning to pick up the game (the digital download will be available starting at midnight on launch day) and are joining us in Anaheim, be sure to bring your console. We’d love to slay some demons with you on the show floor.<br />
<br />
Again, we want to thank you for your patience and support. We are eternally grateful to you and the millions of other Diablo fans around the world whose passion for this franchise inspires us and keeps our fires burning.<br />
<br />
We’ll see you in hell . . . and at BlizzCon!</div></div><hr />

Either way, all this means is something's getting announced, but it probably isn't Diablo IV.</div></div><hr />

I was hoping for a new xpac, and the ultimate announcement would have been D4, but I wasnt holding my breath on that one. <br />
<br />
welp.... a little bit regretting my virtual ticket purchase. <br />

Also, I'm not usually a blizzard naysayer. This just comes as a surprise.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, that's what pisses me off the most. They KNEW THIS beforehand, but waited for ticket sales first, banking on rampant speculation to drive up sales for the virtual tickets. That's just such a scumbag thing to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty much. 99 times out of 100 I'd have given in to the hype and bought a ticket based on this too but I'm glad I dodged it. <br />
<br />
Really struggling to like too much about Blizzard these days, which is a shame :(</div></div><hr />

So when they say &quot;While we won’t be ready to announce all of our projects, we do intend to share some Diablo-related news with you at the show.&quot; they really mean &quot;lol no diablo news period&quot;? is that what yer getting out of that?<br />
<br />
EDIT: idk, there's PR speak that doesn't dismiss the fact that they are going to have some news related to Diablo at the very least... although i reckon this does mean it's probably not Diablo 4. Maybe some new D3 content since the demo stations are right outside the main stage?</div></div><hr />

They obviously don't mean that, but it seems pretty clear that &quot;the big one&quot; is not getting announced - which is what everyone has been waiting for since like 2016.<br />
<br />
There's tons of &quot;Diablo-related news&quot; they can share. D3 on twitch details/release dates/features. Diablo animated series on Netflix. Preview for the next D3 seasons. Whatever. But it seems very likely that new unannounced Diablo project they were hiring all those people for is NOT among the things they are going to announce. And that is extremely disappointing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Blizzard we've had for these number of years disgusts me to no end. Long gone are the days of passionate developers/gamers developing games... all replaced by fucking suits only in it purely for profits.<br />
<br />
&quot;Soon(tm)&quot;, for quality, replaced with deadlines riddled with bugs and cut content.<br />
<br />
I used to love Blizzard, held them to high regards being one of the best in the industry. But now they're a fucking husk following the footsteps of the likes of EA and such.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have not once indicated that a D4 announcement is coming. This was all in everyones heads. Going to blame them for that now?<br />
<br />
If you buy a show ticket based on unsubstantiated rumors, and then get disappointed, there is only one person to blame for that: You.<br />
Afterall, the keynote is free to watch. You could still buy the virtual ticket right after the keynote if you like what they announced there and want more details.<br />
<br />
Its the same shit as pre-ordering games. Generally, just don't do it. There is no advantage to pre-ordering anything digital, it won't be out of stock on release day, and you don't fall victim to your own hype.<br />
<br />
Of course projecting your lack of self control on everyone else is far easier then admit that you shouldn't pre-order shit.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, the tickets were sold anyway during the first day. And they were no plans announced for the Blizzcon panels at that time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qnubi</div><div class="date">2018-10-18, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They trying to build down the hype? Then why put it 1st on mythic stage?<br />
<br />
Because they have nothing. This year will be the worst Blizzcon of all time in terms of announcements. WoW retail has nothing, Diablo has nothing, well at least something, netflix/comic, Overwatch has nothing, hots has nothing and HS is so washed up that you can't possibly make a cardgame expansion your main thing. Honestly Classic hype would have been better than Diablo in this case. For example they could have announced that every virtual ticket holder gets to play Classic demo on the Blizzcon instead of telling people beforehand. At least would have been something. Now we get a Blizzcon with patch announcements. lol</div></div><hr />

BOOM btw Diablo 4? PR nightmare, customer service nightmare... gimme back my money... <br />
<br />
Customers are wishy washy, nature of the biz. People are gonna hate you if you don't announce, hate that they spent money and you didn't announce sooner... we as humans, will always find something to bitch about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It wasn't D4... it was World of Diablo. But with how poorly BfA is performing, I bet anything they are walking it back taking it back to discussion stage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Diablo 3 is handled by the classic games team at blizzard now...<br />
<br />
So there won't be an ounce of new content for diablo 3 ever.<br />
<br />
Quite a shame, some balance changes would've been nice.<br />
<br />
D3 Necromancer best sets are two of basically the same playstyles and I hate it.</div></div><hr />

Seems there might be a showdown between her and Saurfang. I'm a Sylvanas fan, but not to the point of sacrificing Saurfang.</div></div><hr />

Maybe a HD version of 1/2 like they did with starcraft, maybe? Blizz is so damn slow at making these games of theirs. Nintendo switch can't be the announcement they mentioned.</div></div><hr />

Good thing i told him that there's not gonna be any actual exciting news and he backed off :D<br />
<br />
Honestly it's in the same vein as running a scam. I know they hadn't promised anything but they KNEW the communications they put out set the hype train full steam ahead. It's a really scummy thing to do</div></div><hr />
