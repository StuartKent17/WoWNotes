<br />
I personally think we will be getting a Diablo reveal of some kind, I also kind of think we are going to get a surprise announcement of a new RTS.<br />
<br />
Since BFA would have already launched there honestly isn't much more to announce other than future content, so maybe a Queen Azshara cinematic.<br />
<br />
I wish I could go, I had plans to go, but I fortunately got my wife pregnant lol, and it will be due right around then, thank god for the virtual ticket and that I can watch it from the delivery room.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate that so much. Scalpers are scam artists, though not the worst kind out there. They take events that people want to go to and would normally be able to afford and jack it up to insane rates. One year I spent a few hours on eBay reporting every single BlizzCon scalper ticket that was more than $100 above the normal asking price.<br />
<br />
I can understand making a small profit from it, or trying to get a little money for time spent if you wound up not being able to go, but when I see them at $400? $500? $1000? Fuck that.</div></div><hr />

Congratulations on the baby :), yeah few cinematic i guess but they will be released on here most likely and the content announced up PTR shortly after. I'd love to go in person one year but its so expensive flying in from the UK.</div></div><hr />

More like they'll show 8.2 content and 3rd raid. By November we will know already about second raid on Kul Tiras (Azshara), althought I think this time (unlike Nighthold and Blackrock Foundry) they won't test it on Beta, but 8.1 (and 8.1.5) PTR to not spoil story too much.</div></div><hr />

Paying €200 for a ticket for Blizzcon + flight is already borderline insane (I can go to 4 day festivals in my own country for less and get a lot more), so how about a gesture to EU customers by opening up the EU Gear Store (or get another shipping company so FedEx doesn't charge you import tax on a plushy which costs 5€ to make).</div></div><hr />

They don't have to announce a new game every 2-3 years.<br />
<br />
They have an FPS, a card game, a Moba/Team Brawler, an ARPG, an RTS game and an MMO.<br />
<br />
I'd say in terms of games they got a pretty good cover over the market.</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon 2008: Hold my Beer. <br />
<br />
They had already announced WOTLK, announced a new D3 class (still almost 4 years from release), and that SC2 was going to be 3 games now. No Hearthstone, Overwatch, Heroes of the storm yet. <br />
<br />
2016 was most definitely better than that. At least if you were in attendance anyway. All the tournament stuff, Sombra reveal was pretty cool, the 25th anniversary party was pretty great and the weird al concert was awesome.</div></div><hr />

The tournament stuff is incredibly boring for many, the party wasn't that great from what I heard, and Weird Al isn't hard to see for far less money. If you're going to spend that much money doing something in SoCal you're better off hitting the various theme parks.</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon on a reveal year is amazing, I look forward to it months in advance.<br />
<br />
Blizzcon without the announcements is underwhelming and that’s what we’ll get this year there’s nothing to announce outside of patches. We’ll get the .1 WoW patch info, new character and a couple of maps in overwatch, new Heartstone expansion and maybe a couple story missions for SC2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been to every single Blizz Con except the second (broke my sternum 2 weeks before haha) the total cost is a pretty sum for sure, but, for me, it's worth it. I make a holiday around it every year taking between 3 and 4 weeks vaction so I can do some other stuff before and after the event.<br />
<br />
I'm from England and it's definitely a pain to organize and I can imagine people who go just for a few days and only for Blizz Con would spend a pretty penny.</div></div><hr />

But now it just doesn't make sense to fly out, get a hotel room, maybe rent a car, buy a ticket, and then fly back home after taking a couple days off for work just to put eyes on something the online ticket can do for me a whole lot less in the comfort of my home. Or if I really wanted to be cheap like youtube or maybe even a stream can show me hours after the fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
theres the cost and also the worth in going blizz con is only a couple of days so its hard to excuse the travel just for blizz conn so you have to make it a proper holiday but LA is hardly &quot;holiday&quot; marital really for Europeans so its its a choice of a week in LA or a week on a Spanish island beach or a Reykjavik spar. its a no brainier really when you can catch the online coverage :/ <br />
<br />
if they had a European Conn in like Germany or France it would be far more easier to excuses to the accounta....missus</div></div><hr />

Plane tickets from Europe to LA aint that expensive. Car rental or how you want to commute to Anaheim isn’t that bad either. Especially if you book ahead of time.<br />
<br />
Sure, if you just go back to back from the con it’s expensive but if you can take a few days off as a vacation it’s worth the price.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that I've even thought about are those blizzcon pets, that would have been the *only* reason to buy a ticket in the first place in my book. Now it's too late anyway so doesn't matter and I'm sure I'll live regardless of having them.<br />
<br />
The ticket price has never been an issue, it's just the event has always been so bloated and even pointless to me? It's also that I care so little about blizzard nowadays, the only games I've played from them are wow and diablo and they've pushed them both in the ground for the last... decade.</div></div><hr />

Cargo ships are always looking for an extra hand or two for menial jobs the day before they head off due to the inevitable drop outs. Just hang around your nearest port with a resume and passport and look for any ship heading for North America (west coast is preferable). They'll take care of all your papers and will gladly find you a spot on a ship to get you back home. You can hitch hike the rest of the way.<br />
<br />
As for accommodation, any 24/7 McDonalds will do, the graveyard shift teenagers won't care enough to kick you out and if they try, just buy a soft serve and go back to sleep. Alternatively, you can look for a community of homeless people, they'll gladly take care of you.<br />

Supply and demand.<br />
<br />
Tickets initially were much cheaper, is really hard to snatch tickets for the Con at $200 price tag, imagine if those tickets were €15 or €20.</div></div><hr />

I think it's just a fun event to attend regardless, it's awesome to see all the people cosplaying and talking to people, sometimes getting to meet devs and attend things like the sketch groups and just sit down and draw with them.<br />
<br />
Well you hit the nail on the head. I am not to interested in meeting a bunch of people. Honestly I have been to a few big Cons and never really found them interesting. Mostly smelly. Get the Con crud when its over. No where in my statement did I say other people couldn't enjoy it. Just that I don't see the point. I think if I was younger it would be more interesting for sure. But just not worth my bread anymore. I got house payments, car payments, and kids to handle. Just isn't for me when for like what.. 20-30 bucks I can just watch it on the TV in the house.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In terms of BfA there won't be any content at all. <br />
<br />
In terms of Starcraft I'm not even sure, probably nothing.<br />
<br />
Overwatch mandatory hero reveal and maybe a new map, hearthstone maybe new heroes and a new adventure patch, who knows.</div></div><hr />

They should remove the pets and mounts from the store, too. And the digital downloads of the expansions! And the race and server changes! You can only secure those items and services by purchasing a code carved into a piece of wood that's only sold at a store open on Tuesday mornings at 3:42 am (that closes on Tuesday mornings at 3:43 am). The store is also at the top of Coropuna mountain in Peru. Oops, did I say 'mountain'? It's actually a volcano.<br />
