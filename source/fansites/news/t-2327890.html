<br />
We’ll see you at BlizzCon!<br />

BlizzCon Floor Preview Video Removed - Lordaeron Symbol<br />
New videos were added to the virtual ticket (https://blizzcon.com/en-us/event-info/tickets/virtual) today showing different areas of the BlizzCon floor. One of the esports stage happened to show a Lordaeron (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Lordaeron_(kingdom)) symbol that caused some excitement in the speculation thread (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2249901-Official-Patch-8-0-Speculation-thread?p=47768824&amp;viewfull=1#post47768824). That video was then removed a few hours later.<br />

Cue the new expansion &quot;leaks.&quot;<br />
<br />
Still, that they removed it is pretty suggestive. If it's something to do with Lordaeron, maybe it's something to do with Sylvanas or the Old God rumoured to live under Tirisfal. But I think the biggest clue is to look at the end of the expansion. MoP lead into WoD with the Timewalker stuff and Garrosh, WoD progressively became more and more about the Legion and was followed with the Legion expansion.</div></div><hr />

Agreeing with this as all three videos related to the Blizzcon Floor previews were taken down today, rather than just the video showing off the WoW Esports stage (with the Lordaeron symbol).</div></div><hr />

There was never an Old God under Tirisfal. The seeping madness there was caused by a powerful C'thraxxi creature (a minion of the Old Gods) that we killed and absorbed in Tyr's tomb during the shadowpriest artifact questline.</div></div><hr />

So yeah, if you ask me bruvs I think that, right there, is the next expansion. Stay chill my fams.<br />

<br />
Aye I recall Blizzard saying a while ago that the presence beneath Tirisfal mostly as a storytelling tool they could build on later - just one of many tidbits of unexpanded lore that. That they did something with it for the artifacts was neat, since I also went there for the paladin holy artifact weapon. But it's not like everyone knows this so it's one of those ideas that's going to float around for expansion idea material like the South Seas or the Emerald Dream.</div></div><hr />

Why would it be about time travel just because it would involve Lordaeron? Lordaeron is still Lordaeron to humans, their land, and not &quot;Forsakenaeron&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Of course not.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
That particular symbol does not look Forsaken at all. Alliance reclaimation effort?<br />
<br />
Why would it? It's Lordaeron for the rightful owners of the land; the humans.</div></div><hr />

Who gives a fuck about the &quot;live&quot; Q and A when it's all pre approved questions. &quot;Wehere is jain derp derp&quot;<br />

i mean based on blizzcon art that'll be answered basically straight away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, tho you may miss out on some white dmg if you are bad at it. Moving around makes you harder to hit for most classes, even if its ever so marginally and won't work against anyone good it is still an advantage. Some people also just get excited easily, I know some pve'rs that do it and it causes problems on certain bosses.</div></div><hr />
