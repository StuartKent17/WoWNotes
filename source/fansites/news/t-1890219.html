Submit Questions for the Developers<br />
We have our first interview in a long time coming up at Blizzcon and as always, we want to let the community ask questions! This time our interview will be covering the design of Legion.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions you think we should ask, be sure to add them to the comments of the linked post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1885061-Submit-Questions-for-the-Developers) for consideration. We will pick the best questions and add them to our list! <br />
<br />
<br />
Don't post any questions in the comments of this news post. Use the linked topic (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1885061-Submit-Questions-for-the-Developers) instead.<br />
These should be questions about Legion, not Warlords of Draenor.<br />
No class specific questions please. This includes things like balance between the different healing/tank/DPS classes and specs.<br />
Keep questions reasonably short. <br />
<br />

Warcraft Trailer Screenshots<br />
Some screenshots from the Warcraft trailer were posted on Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3qy7l2/warcraft_movie_trailer_stills_leaked/) this weekend. Obviously this was not intended for release and may not represent the final movie. <br />

Day of the Dead<br />
Day of the Dead (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/409-day-of-the-dead) was updated last year. There are several wrestling inspired costumes you can purchase for &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;100&lt;/span&gt; from Chapman (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/34382-chapman). Once in the costume, you can do battle with other costumed players. You can use the costumes even after the holiday is over (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/526831207347023872)!<br />
<br />
There seems to be a bug with the achievements this year, as you can't kill other players with the costume on, only bring them to 1 health. You need to be dueling for them to die. <br />
<br />

<br />
If you haven't already done the other part of the holiday, be sure to check out the guide on Icy Veins (http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/day-of-the-dead).<br />

How do you feel about Wildstar's area-effect visuals and would you change them? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/657713738653528068))<br />
I think Wildstar really made that their thing, so it works for them. I was worried we were going to overdo it for WoW. <br />
I agree with this statement. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/657789508419735556))<br />
<br />
Why is &quot;gamey&quot; considered a bad thing? — Games need rules, but when the rules intrude too much it can be disruptive… https://t.co/IRrx2YUwhh<br />
Real answer: because immersion is often at odds with clarity. Sometimes, there is a more immersive way to get that gameplay. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/657790468688867328))<br />
<br />
Commercial gyms are like Casual guilds, with casual members. Minimum effort yet members want maximum attention / perks. <br />
Gyms want to be a product that everyone buys but very few people use: https://t.co/AYIC1JlY2I (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/658404067702521856))<br />
ultimately you should be happy about those casuals. They keep prices down. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/658404756906360832))<br />
over the members who pour their sweat and hard work day in day out at the gym?<br />
make a gym like that! Maybe you can change the world! (This is all addressed in the linked podcast btw) (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/658407903548674049))<br />
also it is probably not $10-20 more a month. More like &quot;double or triple what I pay now.&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/658408214065606657))<br />
I'm also not saying it's a good thing. Just the way gyms are structured now. Definitely room for high price hardcore gyms. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/658408542269927424))<br />
why should that even be a means to an end though. I'm not even thinking about a REALLY hardcore gym. Just some place that has high<br />
I guess the bottom line is most gyms are setup to sell memberships not to have people work out in them. Seems backwards right? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/658409856244674560))<br />
Just describing why not defending it. But that person who gets on the elliptical for 10 then leaves is more cost effective. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/658410776755990529))<br />
pays as much as you but is only there for 10 minutes. Most cost effective person? The one that never shows up at all. Free money (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/658410952031780864))<br />
real life is very sad (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/658411437207871488))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
what's your take on the popularity of classic WoW servers? Is it time?<br />
I've never played on one. I understand the appeal but not sure if it's a satisfying meal or just a light snack. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/657960612807376896))<br />

<br />
The gym membership analogy? Just Blizzard defending the necessity of 'casual' catered game play elements in WoW again. MMO-Champion occasionally has graphs on this but the usual trend is around 10-15% of raiding guilds setting foot into a mythic raid and only around 0.5-1% actually completing current mythic content. If Blizzard designed all content such that it was only accessible to this 10-15% of players they are bound to see a precipitous drop in subscribers - why subscribe if there is nothing you can or want to do afterall. If they did go that route then obviously they would have to make up for the loss in subscribers with either a higher subscription fee or less content. <br />
<br />
Like he said. Hard core players should be grateful casual players are still subscribed. He said that they keep the price down. The reality is they are probably the only thing keeping the game alive. I'm really hopeful that Legion can bring back and keep some players... I'm personally dreading the day they make the decision to cater to even -more- casual gamers and we end up with a F2P model.</div></div><hr />

The frostwolfs and yes Blackhand is not green because he arrivés with them after the blood drinking.<br />
So everything makes totally sense that they are not green lore-wise.<br />

<br />
Can't say the movie sucks yet, as we don't know the plot, or how well it's acted, but the stills don't really do it for me. They went too far with the realism - I think the MoP cinematic is how it should look - especially the humans. Humans are exaggerated in the game as well as orcs, and these look too..human. Un-epic, if you will. Heroes should be larger than life - especially if it's the look the game has worked hard to establish for a decade. These humans look like generic extras from Lord Of The Rings or Game Of Thrones. These aren't the heroes we've heard about for over tens years. The disconnect between the orcs and humans is too odd - they went to far humanizing orcs, and not pushing the epic, fantasy feel for the humans. The landscapes look normal - and I don't want fucking normal for a fantasy movie, I want blown out, &quot;Holy shit look at that!&quot; over the top environments. Avatar did that. This movie, so far? Nope. Stormwind looks like any old castle...not STORM-FUCKING-WIND! The whole thing looks toned down too many notches, when they should be cranked to the max. <br />
<br />
I fear this is another Howard the Duck, one of ILM's and Lucas's more notorious flops. Peter Jackson and the guys at WETA get fantasy, and how to push it without being too much. They were able to build the environments in LOTR that were realistic, but so fantastical that they looked like something you'd never seen before. <br />

<br />
We know our lore, but we also know Dalaran is going to make a token appearance. Since this is the first movie in a new world, it's not hard to beleive some places will appear only for a bit of world-building. For example, Dalaran could appear with a young Kadghar before he leaves for Karazhan. It's not a stretch to think Capital City could show up.<br />
<br />
Also, we've flown over Stormwind, and it looks nothing like that.</div></div><hr />

I know the orcs are pretty much just green humans on roids at this point with no interesting story to them whatsoever. The only thing that arguably could set them apart was the demon blood, and they've pretty much got rid of that to make sure they're likeable and can't be held responsible whenever they turn in to murderous psychopaths. <br />
<br />
The movie will be the same, pretty obvious from the footage we've seen so far (leaked and official). Orcs will be portrayed as human as possible to make sure everyone understands how sorry we should feel for them. You know, despite invading another planet for its resources. Pathetically bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Commercial gyms are like Casual guilds, with casual members. Minimum effort yet members want maximum attention / perks.<br />
Gyms want to be a product that everyone buys but very few people use: https://t.co/AYIC1JlY2I (holinka)<br />
ultimately you should be happy about those casuals. They keep prices down. (holinka)<br />
<br />
Because I wouldn't want to be found dead in those gyms. I have literally a hundred times more fun in my CrossFit box/gym where I made a lot of friends who I hang out with multiple times a week and where I learned soooo much more and made myself a better person.<br />
<br />
What's even more funny is that my previous (commercial) gym charged me only € 20 less because they had facilities I didn't even use (pet battles, garissons, LFR).<br />
<br />
Pretty much exactly like WoW. It's horrible but at least they &quot;keep prices down&quot;, oh no wait... they don't. <br />
More casual players means keeping prices down is nonsense. The only thing that keeps prices down is competition. If there is no competition it doesn't matter how many 'casuals' they attract prices will stay the same, the only thing that might change is costs going down and/or profits going up. And you get an empty game because these players come and go while this game actually thrives with communities.</div></div><hr />

They single handily ruined the entire genre to placate the casuals. Why? Because they are not only the majority, but the vocal majority - delusional enough to cry about entitlement and instant gratification. Screw immersion in what's supposed to be a rpg. They want to have epicz and they want them now!<br />
<br />
All for the money. Disgusting really. They call themselves game developers. Ironically it only takes about 20k subs for an mmo to stay in the black.<br />

As for GCs comment - not interested in the idea of a classic wow server but a progression server for sure. Matter a fact wow may be the only long term AAA mmo I know of to not run a few.<br />
<br />
It would cost blizzard very little and placate tens if not hundreds of thousands of players. They've done things to the detriment of the entire game for less. Doesn't even make sense.</div></div><hr />

The basicly were no other races in the first war... Or there was, but they kept to themselves. The Night Elf's, didnt think much of the humans, dwarfs or gnomes or any other race other than their own, before the Legion came much later. And the dwarfs and gnomes didnt become allied with the humans before after the first war. The undead didnt exsist, the trolls were against everyone, and the tauren like the night elfs kept to themself mostly.<br />
<br />
But if they make a sequel, then we'll see them all!</div></div><hr />

Look again at the image of Lothar, bottom right you can see a high elf. Also in the leaked trailer, you could make out the poor dreanai.<br />

Pretty sure Humans and Night Elves didn't even know about each other back then. Same goes for Tauren and Humans.<br />
But there should be Dwarves and High Elves (and Gnomes I guess).<br />
<br />
And if they make a sequel who's to say when it will take place (probably the second war and/or beyond the dark portal). Night Elves and Tauren live in Kalimdor and I'm pretty sure they weren't introduced until Warcraft 3.<br />

Orcs look straight from a Wow cinematic, but then there are humans who are, without a doubt, real people. But then you check the backgrounds, and you see that everything is green screen, like the wall that looks like there only a texture (repeated one at that) thrown in. Shit looks as flat as a table.<br />
But I bet the neckbeards that devote thei entire existence to this game will swallow it as if it was gods cum.</div></div><hr />

The only thing that arguably could set them apart was the demon blood, and they've pretty much got rid of that to make sure they're likeable and can't be held responsible whenever they turn in to murderous psychopaths. <br />
<br />
The movie will be the same, pretty obvious from the footage we've seen so far (leaked and official). Orcs will be portrayed as human as possible to make sure everyone understands how sorry we should feel for them. You know, despite invading another planet for its resources. Pathetically bad.<br />
<br />
Orcs were not green humans on roids. Did you even play Warcraft? The Orcs had their own campaign (which is the canon campaign since they win). And there will be Demon Blood, it's why some of the Orcs are turning green in the leaked trailer. The &quot;good&quot; orcs, the Frostwolves, didn't take part in the blood drinking, at least not at the very beginning.</div></div><hr />

Actually it doesn't. RIse of the Horde clearly shows Durotan and Orgrim were green long before they drank the blood. The Orcs are green because of Fel exposure from Warlocks, not from Mannoroth's blood. They were already green by then.<br />
<br />

They just forgot their own lore. Or made them brown so the dumb audience can tell them apart.</div></div><hr />

Jurassic World was a complete shit movie, nothing about it was good. And the CGI did make the movie worse, when stuff looks fake, it distends belief and takes you out of the movie.<br />

the problem with every Jurassic park movie after the original is that they stopped being about something. there was no theme. the only thing there was, was people's lives at risk because a dino was going to eat them.</div></div><hr />
