The Gaze of the Black Prince Returns for the Final Time<br />
Beginning Tuesday, September 2 at 10:00 a.m. PDT, through Tuesday, September 16 at 9:00 a.m. PDT, we’ll be applying the Gaze of the Black Prince buff for the final time before the Warlords of Draenor expansion. This buff will increase the reputation gained with the Black Prince by 100%. It will also increase the chance of obtaining items from his foes needed as a part of the Legendary Cloak quest line including: the Secrets of the Empire (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94593-secrets-of-the-empire), Sigil of Wisdom (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87209-sigil-of-wisdom), Sigil of Power (http://www.wowdb.com/items/87208-sigil-of-power), or Titan Runestone (http://www.wowdb.com/items/94594-titan-runestone).<br />

Garrison Plots Count<br />
Overall our design philosophy is that a few meaningful decisions is better than lots of inconsequential ones.<br />
<br />
This is a video game. there shouldn't be any &quot;consequences&quot;. we should be able to do everything inconseqeuncially. thus we should be able to build everything.<br />
So no matter what button you push, it's always the best one? No matter what you do, you win? That's... horrifying. That's what you want video games to be? That's not a game. I'm not sure what that is. <br />
<br />
All you're doing is turning the garrison from something fun that people can tinker and toy with into something that has to be min/maxed to the nth, leading to just everyone having the exact same garrison choices dependent on what they do in game. The AH tycoon is going to get the bank and AH, the raider is going to go with the bonus rolls, profession buildings are going to be determined by what you are rather than what you're missing, etc.<br />
Right. People will pick buildings that appeal to them based on what those buildings provide. You're stating the intended result as if it's unintended.(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/336042-we-need-more-garrison-plots/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14057706579?page=6#118))<br />

Classes<br />
What's the latest AoE capping rules? X for damage and Y for heals? Thanks.<br />
X=20, Y=6 (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505208849624608768))<br />
<br />
any reason ret loses INQ and gain massive dps increase from Seraphim but ferals still have to SR in their rotation? Seems weird<br />
Seraphim is a choice. Savage Roar can be glyphed, another choice. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505373892287160320))<br />
<br />
what class has given you the most difficulties when it came to balance?<br />
Hmm... Good question. Ones that have abilities that are all interconnected a lot, such as Shadow. Hard to change one thing... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505383768824512512))<br />
...without unbalancing something else. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505383848381669377))<br />
<br />
is the fact that pure DPS classes have more raid utility than a MW a concern?<br />
DPS and Healers aren't competing on utility. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505397617124462592))<br />
<br />
The adjustments to tanks that you hinted at,are these going to be for all tanks or pecific ones? Thanks!<br />
.All tanks. Current plans: Tweak the design of Resolve. Lower tank health. Lower tank mitigation. Lower boss damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505376690470916096))<br />
Active Mitigation was a really good step for enjoy playing like tank. If You nerf AM I hope to not return to the past<br />
AM is a great concept, and we're not planning to remove it at all. We'll be reducing both passive and active mitigation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505432250016477186))<br />

from a PvE perspective what does Lunar inspiration bring. Its basically just a one time per duration shred filler?<br />
Ranged damage, an additional DoT to maintain, and combo builder. Like a ranged Rake. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505376323028914176))<br />
<br />
How are you guys feeling with Balance Druids? havent heard anything recently in any feedback etc!<br />
Generally OK. Might be a bit strong on the multidotting damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505383986261413888))<br />

can monks have chi orbs back in PVP they are much more fun then surging mists? that is all?<br />
They were extremely unintuitive, yet quite overpowered. Sorry. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505376051007344640))<br />
agreed but why surging mists what if we kept chi orbs but added a cast time that you can cast while running...<br />
That's even more unintuitive. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505390848813842432))<br />
<br />
Any chance of WWers getting a stackable utility cooldown? Hearing from Mythic teams that won't be bringing WW/MW due to this. <br />
Multiple Windwalkers not stacking their movespeed is a concern, but that's a really rare combo, currently. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505380468846788608))<br />
MW utility is where the real hurt is though. Devo Aura, Rebirth, Heroism, Guardian Spirit/PW: Barrier....what do MWers bring?<br />
Revival, for it's healing. Dispel is just a minor side benefit. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505392131767545856))<br />

what do you think about empowered seals?<br />
I think it's an interesting playstyle that many will enjoy, and many will hate. Good for a talent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505382146689990656))<br />

thoughts on echo for enhance being too difficult to use with large haste sources? Especially lust/em. Decision tree very complex<br />
It is. Good for a talent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505389125521133569))<br />
<br />
can enhancement get moving LB back? A cast time finisher makes us less mobile than other melee.<br />
No, that should be a niche use. It's ranged, has ranged pros and cons. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505393864686178304))<br />

current state of locks' raid utility or lack thereof reminds me of BC rogues: no utility besides DPS. But our DPS= others'.Why?<br />
Demonic Gateway has high raid utility, despite what some people say. Whole strats based around it all the time. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505379339018715136))<br />
<br />
Don't you feel that warlocks need fel flame back? To build up the last bit of an ember, demonology movement, affli dot refresh<br />
We don't. It's a challenge, but toning down caster mobility is better for the game. Balance. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505380771214159872))<br />
Then why are you toning down only warlocks and shamans? Why are fire mages with scorch ok?<br />
Scorch is primarily a movement tool; damage is trivial. Mobility is one way we differentiate specs. Like how Demo has high mobility (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505396119195889664))<br />

Is Gladiator Stance turning out how you guys planned?<br />
So far, yup. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505388734351966209))<br />
<br />
arms warrior, what can we expect? no softballs here! hopefully small repair on the ol' car.<br />
A little less rage, no more Devestate/Revenge, Mastery buffs, tuning. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505379652484235265))<br />
no more devastate/revenge? Will we see the cooldown from swapping stances go away too then?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505390479715094528))<br />
<br />
At this point, they might as well remove Seasoned Soldier, and buff mastery per point by 33-50%<br />
Seasoned Soldier is a useful tuning knob. Mastery will be tuned on it's own (and is easy to do so). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505374231769931777))<br />
you keep saying this, but seeing as the big hits got neutered for pvp concerns have yet to see how it works.<br />
Arms damage tuning has been based on PvE performance. Mastery is the most easily tuned stat. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505381039863513088))<br />
does that mean the big hit concept is still goal?<br />
Yes, absolutely. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505392234699972608))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
with the removal of combat stats from profs. What're you doing to balance Engineering? As it becomes the clear must hav<br />
Engineering items that have notable combat benefit are becoming available to all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505223316274024448))<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds<br />
Any info to share on the new proving grounds, different style? Or the same but upscaled<br />
In 6.0: Bronze available at level 30 and above. The NPCs scale to your ilvl instead of it downscaling your ilvl. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505393199406673920))<br />
Hope to do much more in the future. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505393250086445056))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
will people with bad pc's be able to raid 20 man, or are people who can't afford updated pc's gonna be stuck heroic?<br />
We've been making some extremely impressive improvements to client performance, especially in raids. I hope you can! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/505382607006490624))<br />
<br />
Any plans to change spine of deathwing roll mechanic to make it less annoying to solo?<br />
Yes - in 6.0 it takes significantly longer for Deathwing to roll when unbalanced if there's only one player on his back. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/505401125227331585))<br />
Some changes planned for Thorim? Impossible for some without engineering. Have to bother someone just to wait in the arena.<br />
Yeah, no more death-ball when the arena is empty in 6.0. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/505411956912558081))<br />

<br />
Am I the only one that think its dumb? They dont listen to people that posted solution on how to make the legendary quest less grinding at this point in the expansion where it doesn't really matter, yet they wont respond/read it. The only solution they came up with was Gaze of the black prince that is F%$king up people on the Valor part and now they say its the last one?! Don't get me wrong I am not a casual noob that whine simple to whine, I have 3 well geared character with the cloak, however I am slowly progressing through the quest with my alt. It would be SO simple to put the buff all the time, or to keep dropping it like they've been doing yet they decided the buff was too much already... does that make sense? Most of us have been in siege of orgrimmar for months and months and are done with heroic encounters however for other players it is a &quot;cockblock&quot; to join guild because it IS a raiding requirement to have the cloak nowdays. Anyway, this could've been easily fixed by removing the valor part or nerfing it again.... or even removing the 1K cap valor cause who care about valor this late in the xpac, if anything its gonna help casual/alt players and they will stick around because they will be able to gear up, go through the quest quickly and upgrade their gear at their will. Sorry for this long text but this upset me when blizzard does dumb stuff like that.<br />

TL:DR Blizzard is retarded. If you wanna know why just read the above lol :P</div></div><hr />

Really pisses me off how much better he bs hardcore mythic armor looks over the normal tier. I was okay with color changes but model changes too ugh fking bs.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a non Heroic(mythic) raider perspective, if you dont put in the time and effort why should you get the same reward<br />
<br />
You shouldnt.<br />
<br />
Not saying you are one of the people but if you believe you dont have the time thats just not a good enough excuse, I raid less then Normal mode guilds and still manage heroics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, if mythic didn't have any special rewards then someone would be complaining that everyone had access to the special armor they get. I won't be doing mythic for sure, but they definitely deserve SOMETHING that distinguishes them from normal mode raiders. Just be happy enough there are easy options to get the gear and see all the content....I am.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They listened months ago. They implemented the Gaze of the Black Prince for people stuck on the Rep or stones part and they've also been throwing in the Heart of the Valorous Buff over the past few months for people stuck on the valor part. If they nerfed it any more than that they'd get a flood of people who did it &quot;the hard way&quot; screaming bloody murder about them giving away &quot;welfare legendaries&quot;.<br />
<br />
It'd be more dumb for them to spend any more time messing with bandaid changes to speed up progression on a questline that has been available in it's entirety for almost a year. The Valor part has been available for almost 2. <br />
<br />
And Valor is being removed from the game in 6.0 completely so that part of the questline will be removed then, it just won't be done specifically to help the tiny number of people who can't wait for 6.0, didn't bother starting the questline before now and were deluded enough to think there was any chance Blizz was going to change the game just for their procrastinating butts was in the realm of possibility. If they've waited this long to do it, they can wait another month or two.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree with this. My guild is going to try and do mythic, but if it doesn't happen i can always go back later. Its just a game not a big deal. The people that do the hardest content in the game deserve a little more though and im glad to see blizzard agree with that. <br />
Just like in the real world you dont get things handed to you with out putting in some effort. If people want the gear either wait till a later tier and go back or step up your game. (Before someone comments and brings this up) no not every mythic raiding guild plays 7 days a week actually most wont do that. <br />
My guild raids 2 nights a week and we are going for Mythic for example and we have been a heroic raiding guild since wrath on our limited schedule.</div></div><hr />

You still have a chance to get the legendary. Seriously dude? It's pretty easy to get, be glad you can go faceroll LFR till you get it. You've had the entire expansion to get it, yet you come back in the last month and expect it instantly?<br />

You do know you do not need to do raids to get Valor?<br />
2 weeks should give you a day or 2 - just leave the raids on that last week and HC scen/HC dungeon spam until you are capped.<br />
<br />
Once you move onto the secrets then do the raids - 1 week is usually enough for the secrets questline.</div></div><hr />

Cry me a river, you've had a good 80 weeks to get past the valor part. If you cry about not getting it done in the last few weeks before the cloaks are rendered obsolete then don't expect a ton of sympathy.<br />

Where's the sense of accomplishment with this ridiculous mindset? &quot;Games are meant to be fun!!!&quot; Yeah, and you know what's fun? A challenge. Something that's been sorely lacking. I shouldn't have to go to Heroic Difficulty just to be able stay awake during fights. Blizzard got greedy, and then they got stupid. They saw those numbers falling down hard after Cata flopped and they panicked- started throwing every cheap advantage and trick they could to get casual players to stay on and keep pumping their 15 a month into their coffers.<br />
<br />
Except that fucking flopped too! XP slashes made the levelling process go by so fast new players don't even have time to get enamored with the world anymore- and LFR gutted the challenge of raiding for when they got to max. So what happens? Players get bored and leave, because why would they stick around when they've already seen the raids in their entirety, even if scaled all the way back so that even little elderly Miss Perkins from Ohio and her twenty cats can get through it? Can deck themselves out in Tier? They don't. They get bored and leave because they're not being challenged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the people in LFR are stopping after LFR, what makes you think that the vast majority of those people would even want to do normal's or heroics in the first place? DO you honestly think that those people would be more inclined to stay with the game without LFR?<br />
<br />
This logic of &quot;People run LFR and leave because its too easy&quot; just seems off base to the people actually running LFR. And if you are one of those people that ran LFR and then quit, and are now saying the game is too easy, why do you not run normals now? what is the difference if you really want the harder difficulty when its right they for you to play?</div></div><hr />

i agree , but still a challenge in a game is still a GAME and fun and not WORK . thats all i am saying .<br />
If people want to be rewarded for playing alot and being dedicated towards game and guild i think thats a good thing, but dont let it look like its alot of effort and work to do so . YOU chose to do it because you love it ,otherwise its plain stupid to play a game that is making you feel like going to work . If you wanne work get a job it pays better then some gearset . If you wanne have fun and feel good in the end ?play and have fun .Wath kind of gear you wear should not be all that important as long as you have fun getting it .</div></div><hr />

However, I see they too have not escaped the wrestling belt trend this expansion. If you belt buckle is not the same width as your torso, Blizzard aint having it.<br />
<br />
And wrestling belts are bad why? Look at the history of armor and clothing in the last 5000 years. Crappy TV wrestling shows did not make up this style of waist adornment. It fits perfectly into Warcraft's look and feel. You may as well complain about the giant boots and shoulders too. <br />
It's abdominal armor, it fits with the battle mage/warlock aesthetic of Warcraft just fine.</div></div><hr />

You do know that there has always been a TINY fraction of the WoW playerbase that's been invested in the truly challenging content, right? You pretending like everyone wants challenge above FUN = you projecting YOUR feelings and needs onto everyone else.<br />
<br />
Games are not work, if I didn't have FUN while doing it I wouldn't touch heroic raiding. Look at Wildstar, has it become the most successful mmo ever with its gruesomely challenging content, attunement requirements and so on? No...it'll become a niche game since guess what, SO many players simply want to have FUN and that means little effort for a sense of progression. They still won't be getting the HIGHEST sense of progression for their toons that players participating in the most challenging content will get. I believe Blizzard have these numbers which is why features like LFR came to be in the first place. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I know of some chinese gentlemen who would sit around in teams and work in WoW all day and then sell their efforts for real money!</div></div><hr />

Next time you see them tell them their business model is being Hijackt by a few thousand guilds ;-) .<br />

Just like Challenge mode, gold will get it, not skill, so why fuss?<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs a system that individually rates players, so carrying isn't possible for &quot;snow flake&quot; sets.<br />
<br />
This is why I love OpenRaid in a nutshell. The player rating system is amazing and I never have to deal with &quot;I'm in 540 gear but I haz the skeelz for Heroic mode, everybody in LFR tells me I'm good&quot; crowd or the &quot;I'm 589 on my main so you should carry my undergeared alts&quot; or the people who just got lucky on gear.</div></div><hr />

Look at the history of armor and clothing in the last 5000 years. Crappy TV wrestling shows did not make up this style of waist adornment. It fits perfectly into Warcraft's look and feel. You may as well complain about the giant boots and shoulders too. <br />
It's abdominal armor, it fits with the battle mage/warlock aesthetic of Warcraft just fine.<br />
<br />
They are bad because they are too gaudy and make you look pregnant. In fact that is what we call them...preggo belts:p. Belts were not always so and I wish they would go for a more subtle / classy style. It is the one of the primary reasons I transmog to older sets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You still have a chance to get the legendary. Seriously dude? It's pretty easy to get, be glad you can go faceroll LFR till you get it. You've had the entire expansion to get it, yet you come back in the last month and expect it instantly?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Aye, I overheard Metzen saying &quot;Lets put it so Voisier can't use it, it's funny watching him get so angry.&quot; You've had the whole expansion!<br />
<br />
I feel so sorry for your misguided reaction. So much clueless in one post with few words. <br />
<br />
1) The legendary status of the item is not legendary if you can get it with only time, so no, its not about ' omg gief new legendary nou' <br />
2) I had the whole expansion? Oh thats nice, because I did I would probably have it ?................................ ( the many dots is reflected at the stupidity of that )<br />
3) Why do you think its their in the first place.. because the original way of doing it is is busted to the core.<br />

<br />
The valor crap takes 3 weeks to do at worst and you've been stuck on it for 4 with 2 more to go? The problem isn't the buff going away.<br />
<br />
Some simple math that you probably don't understand. You need 3000 valor, which is 3 weeks. Sadly perfections like that doesn't excist unless you timed it beforehand. Meaning I with 200 valor remaining when I picked up the quest, which means 4 weeks ;) week 1 200, week 2 1200 week 3 2200 week 4 3300 &lt;--- SUCCES!</div></div><hr />

Mythic raiding already comes with the perk of giving you the very best gear to slay stuff in, which surely will not be worse in WoD's approach to gear (closer than ever to pvp etc). Maybe make titles like with gladiators instead? They're sometimes already there as a perk, but not always.</div></div><hr />

Why do you play? wel clearly for your amusement (or not ?) . Look at the logo http://eu.blizzard.com/en-gb/ it says &quot;Blizzard Entertainment&quot; not &quot;Blizzard workplace, workshop&quot; . So dont act like your working whilst playing a game , skill ,time and dedication are very different things and they will all differ from person to person . Dont get me wrong i think that people that kill the highest tier (difficulty) should get the reward they deserve for being so good and dedicated to the game they love to PLAY with their freinds .<br />
<br />
Sorry but maybe you misunderstood my point - plain English.<br />
<br />
To help I've taken an extract from the Oxford English Dictionary on the definition of 'work': &quot;Noun. Activity involving mental or physical effort done in order to achieve a result: he was tired after a day’s work in the fields&quot;.<br />
<br />
Watching people fail to wipe on mechanics does take some mental effort, especially after prolonged periods, hence the word is very much relevant and hence you are only assuming work in an &quot;occupational&quot; sense. Do I still enjoy the game yes. Does it take mental effort to achieve a result yes. <br />
<br />
I know your mind is probably blown right now - you should have taken the blue pill.</div></div><hr />

That was never WoW to begin with. You must be confused with another game.<br />

Hey, you're the one that was getting snarky to begin. The fact is you /have/ had the whole expansion to get it, and complaining that you can't just get it NOW when you've come back in the last month is just complaining for the sake of it. It's not Blizzards fault that you decided to wait until the last minute to do something that takes a bit of time. You're right in saying that it's dimished as a legendary....because of the fact that you've had the entire expansion to get it and anyone can do so as long as they spend 2-3 hours a week doing LFR. Because of it being so easy to get, there's nothing wrong with having to wait just a while to get it. Besides, you're clearly not planning on doing any proper raiding if you haven't already got it, so why do you need it in the first place?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wayne25uk</div><div class="date">2014-09-03, 12:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's probably right though not quite in the sense he thinks. It's a pretty tell-tale sign that the WoD pre-patch with mythic SoO will be landing soon.<br />
<br />
Or it could just be that hes so excited for the next expansion that any sign at all makes him think its coming. Its typical human behavior to look for signs and hope and shit like that and see any little event as a &quot;sign&quot;. It could mean 6.0 or it could just mean the buff has served its use? But no its more exciting to believe a new game is coming out than look at the truth....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And what did the poor guy do after a day's WORK in the fields ???<br />
He got behind his keyboard to PLAY some wow and RELAX after a day of WORK .<br />
See the difference between entertainment at free will and being forced to work to feed yourself and others .<br />
If a game feels like work or it mentaly drains you its no entertainment anymore ,and then Blizzard Entertainment will have failed his goal .In this case the game has proven to be to much for you and then its time to look for somthing else to play that feels less like its draining you .<br />
If your entertainment after work feels like work you will not get rested enough and get overworked (or in your case overplayed :p) and you will need to take lots of pills .<br />
Take your dictionary and look up playing ,entertainment and fun you will see there is not alot of backbraking work or physical effort involved . If wow really was work it would be shut down for childslabour ;) .Also if a friend arrives at your house and you are raiding , how does your wife , mum , boyfriend ......reply to them ? Sec i go get him &quot;he is working in a game&quot; or &quot;He is playing a game &quot; on the computer .</div></div><hr />

Really? Seriously? Because that's honestly what it seems like the game has degraded to over the years. Look at the friggen talent system, FFS.</div></div><hr />
