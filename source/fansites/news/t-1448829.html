Patch 5.4.7 - New Shop Button<br />
Patch 5.4.7 adds a new shop button to the character selection screen, making the Level 90 Boost as the first character service that you can purchase in-game. Taepsilum responded to concerns of players upset over the addition of another shop button.<br />
<br />

<br />
I know that for those of you who are just not interested at all in the store, these changes might seem somewhat redundant or even a bit annoying. I get that, I really do.<br />
<br />
But please understand that a lot of players do like to use the shop, and since this is a fairly new feature (the in-game version of the shop), we want to make sure that everyone is aware of its existence and that you don't actually have to tab out to a web browser to use it.<br />
<br />
The buttons outside of the micro-menu exist mainly because the micro-menu is one of those parts of the interface that some addons and UI packs actually hide by default, and we want everyone to know about this new functionality.<br />
<br />
I really don't think that this is being in any way obtrusive and/or preventing you from playing the game as you have been doing all along. Now, I do understand that some players might have some more philosophical reasons to dislike it, but I still think that some are just blowing this out of proportion. It's a small button that you can choose to use or to completely ignore, it's not a pop-up window that forces user-interaction with it. <br />
<br />
Of course there is a fine line that we don't want to cross when it comes to the number and the positioning of any kind of button within the game, too few buttons or poorly positioned ones often leads to unused/unknown features, too many, and they can become redundant or annoying. I can see that some of you are of the opinion that anything over one button is already too much. <br />
<br />
You can rest assured that we will forward all of your feedback to the proper channels, it's important to us that everyone knows about new functionalities but obviously we don't want to cause any discomfort to anyone while doing so.<br />

Warlords of Draenor - PvP Toggle Changes<br />
It looks like players that don't enjoy PvP might be getting an upgraded version of the PvP toggle in Warlords of Draenor!<br />
This is very simple. PVP needs to be voluntary.<br />
Well, I understand where you're coming from, but flagging as a PvE character is based on a player's action to flag themselves (even if it's on accident), so I'm not sure it's us making you PvP. The systems that can cause someone to flag can absolutely at times be involuntary, which is notably frustrating.<br />
<br />
In any case we are continuing toward a goal of a PvP on/off toggle for players on PvE realms to be added in Warlords of Draenor, which would absolutely and in all situations allow someone to refrain from becoming flagged regardless of their actions. Heals toward flagged players would fail, coalescing to PvP realms wouldn't be possible, misclicks and AoE's would never damage a flagged opponent, etc. It's actually quite a bit of work because of all the systems involved, but it's still something we think PvE players should have, and how the game should work for them.<br />

doing dps less than a dps spec I assume. If you can tank and dps at 100% why being a regular dps?<br />
Yeah, Tank-specs should do less DPS than DPS-specs, so you don't just bring more Tanks. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422846946064089088))<br />
But Vengeance makes sure that not all tanks do that much DPS right?<br />
Not in 6.0; Vengeance no longer affects DPS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422851715914670080))<br />
What is it changed to again? Threat?<br />
It's just the defensive side of what it does today. Will also do Threat if needed, but that's not likely. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422872882050387968))<br />
I am lost as to what you mean by that, I guess I will have to wait and find out...<br />
Vengeance currently provides a buff that has both offensive and defensive value. We'll leave the def value, remove off value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422886250270306307))<br />
Does that mean tanks are going to end up less-fun? A lot of the fun of tanking recently has come from vengeance.<br />
Who can say if any specific change makes the game more or less fun for any given person. But no, it shouldn't. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422919245245071360))<br />
You're most likely not having fun because of Vengeance-&gt;DPS; rather because you do good damage, and the def gameplay is fun. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422919560484761600))<br />
Is the idea for Tanks to just more or less do (arbitrary number) 75% of the damage of a DPS all the time?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422933612514660352))<br />
<br />
Are you guys happy with the current DPS rankings? Casters completely dominating melees in pretty much every SoO encounter.<br />
Our data, and community data, heavily disagrees with that. Melee are more of a liability, which we hope to solve. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422854852104835072))<br />
<br />
OK, fair. When you and your crazy brain crew crunch data, do you do APM analyses? What does it mean to you guys in that context?<br />
We do (abilities per sec), though it's more of something to just 'keep in mind'; we don't really balance around it at all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422606073011253248))<br />
APS seems like a strange standard. Wouldn't most specs hover around 1?<br />
No, not at all. Most don't have a 1sec GCD; spamming something on every GCD is not something we want most to do (OK for some). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422646318658355200))<br />
So WoD dev vision is that GCD locking is OK for some specs? Can you explain why you changed your minds on this?<br />
This isn't a change; we're OK with a few specs explicitly designed to be GCD locked. It's desired by some players. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422845226965680129))<br />
There have been a few cases where we've decided that specs required too high of an APM (just in terms of raw button presses). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422606662138986497))<br />

Do you have plans to address Hunter's secondary stats value? (like Warrior's haste)<br />
Those are not even remotely in the same ballpark. But yes, we want to raise their values. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422871511658016768))<br />

You said we cannot switch in/out seal of faith while in combat. So could we still switch other seals in combat like SoT to SoJ?<br />
Yes. That's expected if you take the other talent which gives you seal-twisting gameplay. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422847734173794304))<br />
So does the healing bonus stackable and dispelable?<br />
Talking about Faith again? Faith would stacks, and would not be able to be dispelled. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422849850531524608))<br />
That sounds good. SRY one LAST question: Is there a cap stacks of Faith? IF YES, what number will it be?<br />
We'd likely need to have a cap, but not one that you're expected to hit in normal gameplay. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422869137493225473))<br />

Dedicated Holy Priests raiding heroic had a hard time the past years. Representation is down to 2-5%. Is this an issue to you?<br />
It's a potential issue that is heavily clouded by the Disc issue. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422870280357154817))<br />
So you don't think it has anything to do with shortcomings with HPriest spec? Chakra reduces the usefullnes and lack of utility?<br />
I think that if you re-read my tweet, you'll see that I didn't say that at all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422871649201836032))<br />
Then what do you think HPriest shortcomings are?<br />
We aren't ready to announce specific changes, but the shortcomings of Chakra have been heavily discussed. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422873131229790208))<br />

Did you ever consider Shuriken Toss to be some Rotation/playstyle changing talent like alot of hybrids have nowadays?<br />
Do you mean like if you take that talent, then you use that as your optimal rotation, even on Patchwerk? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422512546394812417))<br />

was idly wondering what the odds are shamans can get a passive that makes 2H weapons competitive against DW. I miss the option.<br />
We have no plans to bring back 2H Enhancement, currently. Not 100% out of the question for the future, but not right now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422933494096883712))<br />

are you happy with results of Demo nerfs? Feel like it's struggling pve and pvp after imp damage and glyph nerf.uvls was enough<br />
The community things the Demo nerfs were way more crippling than they were. There are still Demo locks doing very very high DPS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422918861009076225))<br />
That's not to say that it hasn't ended up inferior to Affliction/Destruction in most situations; it has. But not underpowered. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/422919051610836993))<br />

If they're just trying to hold out till the inevitable f2p and make as much money as they can before then, then that is their decision, it is not however a decision I will continue to support.<br />

If they really cared about the people who didn't want to see the buttons then they should have had an option that hides them, not shove it down your throat on multiple screens that they don't even want addons to hide anymore.</div></div><hr />

The people's problem is that Blizz is implementing pay to win features in a game that charges $15 a month to play already. The greedy douche bags are gouging those willing to buy from the shop, wasting time creating new shit for it. Making people wait without info on anything Warlords related, so people are getting agitated. Then they shove more shop features down people's throats. It wouldn't piss people off so much if they would just say they're going p2w. Albeit buying max level toons is not pay to win yet, they're getting awfully damn close now.</div></div><hr />

It's on the login screen, over by the menu and options buttons. The ingame one is down near your PvE/PvP queue buttons. It's like... not intrusive at all.<br />
<br />
And IDK what game you guys were playing but there was ALL KINDS of whinging about LFR, Dragon Soul, Dragon Soul being the last raid and hocarp no raids after that, pets and mounts in the cash shop, ZOMG EFFING PANDAS WTF when the xpac was announced... all in all a lot more whinging about stupid crap than what's happening here.</div></div><hr />

I dont think anyone (reasonably considered) suggests that things are P2W now - there is just alot of upset because as each addition is suggested and added, it seems to be moving towards that.</div></div><hr />

On a real note. lvl 90 boots is kinda bad idea. not sure why bliz would do that, of course besides the cash behind it. but still it would be more of a bad thing then a good thing. shrugs. i guess to each there own. hopefully Month sub will go down if lots people buy the lvl 90 boots, also wonder what the restrictions on it is. Like, Do you have to have atlest 1 90 to buy a 90 or do you have to own WoD to buy a 90 (only things i can think of atm).<br />
<br />
<br />
Just wanted to add, i see buying gear in the near future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, I don't think it's P2W right now, but they're getting further along that track. Also, they are spending more and more resources on the shop feature, as it's garnering money for them, touting how people want it so bad, when no, it's just them being greedy. They spend time on this, and not actual game content. Just shinies for people and money for them. <br />
<br />
Who knows if down the line if Blizz will think it's profitable to sell other high end things.</div></div><hr />

I'm a paying customer, don't tell me what I can or can't be upset about. I have the right to complain about whatever the fuck I want. Only here would people be praised for not liking something but staying silent and bending over and taking it. In the rest of the world it's a sign of strength when you stick up for something you don't like. If the cable company is screwing you I don't see legions of cable company fanboys whining about how you should just shut up and that the cable company is just trying to make tv better bla bla bla. You need a reality check. When the cook at your restaurant screws up your steak you're welcome to shut the hell up and take it and not complain. Some of us have a spine and voice our opinions and tell the cook to make a new steak. We're allowed to do that no? I mean this is a discussion forum is it not?</div></div><hr />

I can't politely state how stupid most of this criticism is. As for the level 90 boost, try using your brain for a second. You want to sell someone on the game, you already have to sell them the battle chest + two expansions (as of WoD, prior to them expanding the Chest). You have to sell them on a subscription, and then you're going to have to sell them on a significant time investment in order to level a character to 90.<br />
<br />
Now, imagine how much easier your sale would be if you could say, &quot;If you don't mind spending a little extra money, you can level a character to within ten levels of the cap immediately and get right into the new content, and visit the old content later if you wish.&quot; Get it now? We aren't talking about buying level capped, geared character, we're talking about jumping straight to the new stuff. Get over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's actually quite smart on blizzards behalf that if a long time between now and WoD is inevitable add preorders now and lvl 90s now to make people want the mount and play alts. It's smart for the alt part. The reason I don't play alts is because lvling is boring for me after my first char. But if I could insta 90 an alt from preorder id play it and gear it. More than 1 maybe. So it's smart to make up for incoming sub losses. Bring them back and make money off<br />
Of it. I know I've seen quite a chunk of people that'll play just because of the 90 boost. We may see a sub boost depending how they handle it during a time where wed get sub drops.</div></div><hr />

It's kind of funny when you think about it. The only other games you'd expect a shop to be labelled everywhere is a free to play game, which last time i checked WoW isn't.

<br />
They needed the one on the login screen, if they want to sell 90s. Else you'd have to create a lv1 character and then in game up it to lv 90. Awkward.<br />
Now you can buy and create a 90 right away.<br />
<br />
The one in the micro menu can be hidden via addon. I have a little addon that eliminates it and brings the help icon back.<br />
The one in the ESC menu is the truly useless one, that one is there so people that do have addons get reminded there's a shop. <br />
<br />
Now we can argue about the ridiculous golden border (I bet it'll blink or flash when they're done with it).<br />
Or we can argue about the moronic fact that the buttons are still there (greyed out) when I disable the shop in my parental controls.<br />
These 2 actually bother me.<br />
<br />
Oh and did you know they already have the tech to make ingame popups possible? I wonder how long it'll take for us to need a ShopBlockPlus addon... &gt;.&lt;<br />

They know the only people left playing WoW are the overly addicted fan boys of the game, you know the ones that need to have every single mount, pet and achievement in the game so that their life feels somewhat complete, blizz see this and so their trying to milk every last penny out of the game.<br />

We will see alot worse in the coming months and years. They will push the line further with every patch until ppl find it acceptable to buy pretty much everything instead of actually playing the game.<br />
<br />
So ppl have a chance NOW to decide if they want to take part in that. This is the perfect time to say no, unsub and not look back for next 6-8 months. Blizzard will have to release sub numbers for 2 more quarters before next expansion and they might have to think twice if ppl actually reacted to this now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They know the only people left playing WoW are the overly addicted fan boys of the game, you know the ones that have to have every single mount, pet and achievement in the game so that their life feels somewhat complete, blizz see this and so their trying to milk every last penny out of the game.<br />
<br />
Game won't ever be what it once was, free level 90 boosting as a main game feature for an expansion somes it all up.<br />
<br />
Yeah right, they totally have a guy withe a club standing behind me.<br />
He beats me up every time I don't met the monthly shop buying quota.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with the ingame shop itself. Apart from the fact that it is utterly useless to me, since I do not own a credit card, nor do I want one (German).<br />
<br />
<br />
They will push the line further with every patch until ppl find it acceptable to buy pretty much everything instead of actually playing the game.<br />
If Joe rich guy wants to spend money instead of time, thats his prerogative.<br />
Doesn't change a damn thing about my gameplay or my ability to enjoy the actual game content.<br />
<br />
I raid because it's fun to do so (most of the times^^) with my group. I don't raid for status and I don't raid for the epics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it is not. <br />
It has 0 impact on gameplay if leveling is as trivial and meaningless as it is now.<br />
<br />
Selling gear would be pay to win in PvP.<br />
<br />
I'm not entirely sure if pay to win even exists in the realm of PvE. <br />
It would only be a &quot;pay to win faster&quot; because you win anyway.</div></div><hr />

2) For those that haven't realized it the lvl 90 is also a virtual reboot of wow for new players so they dont pick up a game and go crap i gotta go through 100 lvls before i can play raids and dungeons screw that. The being able buy it part is prob so they can make it easier/cheaper than what would happen if they didn't which is people would buy the battle chest + mop + wod, get the 90 + pay to account transfer it. Yes, people would do that, a lot of people ALREADY do it via recruit a friend. Its needed for new/returning players and does nothing to effect current ones but gives us more people to play with. <br />
3) I doubt current tier gear will ever be sold in the NA makert if anywhere....anytime in the next decade.</div></div><hr />

they also didn't add any content at all.<br />
We're at least getting SOMETHING, and a PvP season.<br />

Ultimately if the time between the last content patch and the next expansion is shorter than Cata (long) and Wrather (Much longer) I say Blizz are doing something right. But of course, people like to complain about everything.</div></div><hr />

Dude its just a color swap of the gear they are lazy as balls to not have a different set of gear as back up to go with this &quot;back pocket&quot; season. So dumb.

Blizzard themselves outright said they want leveling to be quick and easy in WoD and that they are going to further increase leveling speed (likely by cutting the required XP to level down again).<br />

Their actual words were: &quot;Leveling should be a quick romp through the zones.&quot; Basically meaning 1-90 should be about as quick to manually level as it would be for your new paid 90 to process ;P</div></div><hr />

I love people like you who come into my store and complain about stuff.<br />
<br />
See...customers like you think that they know better than us who are knowledgeable about our work and what we produce. We may nod and smile to your face, but behind your back we are wishing we could use Finger of Death (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=32111/finger-of-death#.) on you IRL whilst mocking you. <br />
<br />
But to use your own metaphor against you: <br />
<br />
This is nothing like a steak at a restaurant. When you order one there, you are specifically having it custom tailored to you and only you. One steak, for one of you. To compare WoW to a Steak this particular steak would have to be the size of a city feeding all of them at once, one steak for 7-8 million people, and when only 1-2% of them complain that it's well-done and not rare then oh well the majority is happy and that is all that matters.</div></div><hr />

They won't change 1-85. That's already a quick romp.<br />
They'll probably nerf 85-90.<br />
90 to 100 will be as quick as Wrath (If we're lucky). <br />
I just hope they don't give every quest mob a metric ton of HP anymore. Kill speed in Dread Wastes was sooo annoyingly sluggish.</div></div><hr />

Seriously?<br />
I can't see how they can make 1-85 quicker as it is. if you run dungeons, you already out level every zone after completing max 30% of it. Oo</div></div><hr />

I basically think they are looking at leveling from the standpoint of someone who has no heirlooms, or no guild xp bonus.<br />
My guess is that non heirloom leveling will become as quick as heirloom leveling currently is...and heirloom leveling will be just ridiculous.<br />
<br />
But I understand why they want this....we now have 100 levels to go through, so when you make a new character that's a LOT of catchup to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes there has been an 80% staff increase since cata was released in 2010. This staff is most likely being used to dish out more content at a faster pace. Now I understand that 8 months is predy rediculous and although I agree with you on this cata and wrath werent very different. The life span of wrath or cata for that matter from the time it released to the time it ended was significa tly longer compared to pandaria. Cata had 3 patches that spanned over A YEAR AND A HALF. pandaria had 4 patches that spanned over 11 and a half months content is coming out quicker and quicker, its more Consistent now then ever and will Continue to become more consistent. We may still be waiting for beta 4 months later but who knows maby beta with release in a phew weeks and then be done in 2 months. And the shop button was added in game as a convenience to the players interested in the shop content so that people wouldnt have to go on the website to purchase the pets and mounts. They added another shop button on the login in screen for the lvl 90 boost. If you do t like the shop Infact hatw it and dont want anything to do with it. Then dont touch it dont acknowledge it. It was put into the game for a apecific reason. Its like pet battles its there but you dont need to use it. At all! I for one am happy they added it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well look at the end of WoTLK all we had for filler was Ruby Sanctum that was so so. Icecrown Citadel was released on 8th December 2009 and lasted till 7th December 2010 when Cataclysm came out.. Dragon Soul was released on December 6th 2011 lasted (with no filler content) till MoPs release on 25th September 2012.. <br />
<br />
So looking at that ICC went for longer 13 months or so (but yes there was some filler in Ruby Sanctum) and that Dragon Soul went for 11 months or so with very little added after DS was released.. <br />

Do you press all the &quot;fire alarm&quot; buttons you see in public places? Just because they are there? <br />
You got the option to visit the store on your own initiative, you can disable it in parent control if you know that you have a hard time with stuff like money management. <br />
Can some one please explain why this is a insta win in wow, or p2w. I don't see it. How in any way is this a bad thing? You want to get back to the game but you don't want to invest the time it takes to lvl a toon from 1-90. Does it matter if its a new or old players who uses this service? You don't get a lvl 100 toon with epic gear. You still need to learn the class you are playing, otherwise what's the point in playing.<br />
Do you feel that this is an insult towards you in the time you put down in this game, or all the challenges you faced? You still got the proof of that if you wish to face plant that info to all new players you meet in world of warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't politely state how stupid most of this criticism is. As for the level 90 boost, try using your brain for a second. You want to sell someone on the game, you already have to sell them the battle chest + two expansions (as of WoD, prior to them expanding the Chest). You have to sell them on a subscription, and then you're going to have to sell them on a significant time investment in order to level a character to 90.<br />
<br />
Now, imagine how much easier your sale would be if you could say, &quot;If you don't mind spending a little extra money, you can level a character to within ten levels of the cap immediately and get right into the new content, and visit the old content later if you wish.&quot; Get it now? We aren't talking about buying level capped, geared character, we're talking about jumping straight to the new stuff. Get over it.<br />
<br />
Imagine how easier it would be to just have everyone start at 90 as default. Then new players wouldn't have to go through all that crap and nobody would have to be nickle and dimed f2p style in a p2p game. But you keep defending their greed, you must be a shareholder.<br />
<br />
As for the button. Sometimes a guildie will invite me to something on the calendar. There have been times where I've tried to just ignore it but that glowing question mark at the top right gets extremely annoying so I end up just going up and hitting decline. Like another poster here said, it won't be long until specials will be in the store and it will glow on and off till you click it. We all know it's coming.<br />
<br />
As for pay to win. There is no way to win this game. Pay to win is someone who has money having an advantage over someone who doesn't. Sub fees are supposed to make everyone equal. Someone who has more money and is able to skip 90 levels of content is having an advantage. That's a few weeks of resets to get gear, get legendary drops, get into a raid group etc. If they want people to skip all that content they should make it equal and remove it all. Rip off the Rift scaling feature and allow us to lower our levels and go back and do the content optionally if we want.</div></div><hr />

1-2 new Super mega hard heroic scenarios would have been better than this crappy shop button...<br />

<br />
Yes, it would have been. But, a crappy shop button took one person 2 hours to implement. So your choice is actually Shop Button v No Shop Button, that's it.</div></div><hr />

It is in no way Pay to Win. You are paying for a level 90, when the &quot;winning&quot; only starts to begin. I certainly did not &quot;win&quot; when I ding'd 90 on any of my 4 toons, it was more like I lost... many days of fresh air. <br />
<br />
I did &quot;win&quot; when I downed Garrosh though, or at least felt like I did. But that took time and certainly doesn't happen when you ding 90.<br />

We're at least getting SOMETHING, and a PvP season.<br />
<br />
Ultimately if the time between the last content patch and the next expansion is shorter than Cata (long) and Wrather (Much longer) I say Blizz are doing something right. But of course, people like to complain about everything.<br />
<br />
Ruby Sanctum.<br />
<br />
<br />
The developers designing and making in-game mounts and pets are probably not the same devs working on WoD. Also, the less content we have in MoP, the faster WoD will be released. Hopefully...<br />
<br />
Those are artists and programmers that could be working on WoD. They always remind us they only have a finite amount of resources. That if they choose to work on something then something else will be delayed. So when they have coders and artists working on cash shop crap that is taking resources away from WoD development. They can't pick and choose when to remind us of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
But to use your own metaphor against you: <br />
<br />
It wasn't a metaphor, it was an analogy. It was comparing the ability to speak up if you don't like what you're paying for. Think of any situation in life where you are not satisfied or find something wrong and you speak up or complain. How many of those are filled with white knight defenders jumping down your throat telling you to just take it? Only in video games are you not allowed to voice your opinion. It's quite amusing when you step back and look at it.</div></div><hr />

They already sell gear in the store. It has no stats so people said it's cool. So what happens when it has stats? The white knights will just keep making excuses saying stuff like &quot;Well, it's not BIS so I have no issue with this.&quot; I'm looking forward to the excuses when it eventually does go to BIS. I'm sure they'll think of something like &quot;Well, it's just two BIS pieces, when they start selling entire sets then I'll be mad&quot;.<br />

I wish i was as shortsighted as you.

Leveling and questing should be at the core of the game and not some inconvenience to be run through as fast as possible. But in WoW, it just isn't: random time/location traveling in and out of xpacs meaning no cohesive story (this is single most annoying thing), terrible PvP balance, confusing old-style dungeons and raids, the new talent system not giving any interesting rewards each level, and none of the new content at max level being scaled down to lowbies (like proving grounds/brawlers guild). It's just hopelessly fucked. Let the new guys skip it if they want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I were to buy a level 90 I WOULD do it at the character screen. Button seems appropriate it's not as though it's cluttering the character screen, I barely look at the bottom left unless I have an addon that needs disabling (which I usually do in-game anyway). The button in the menu is somewhat useful, I personally disable the main interface so I can't access the feature if I wanted to. Not getting all the bitching, sounds like people wish they had money but instead of getting a job just spend their time crying instead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure what you find so funny. Yes ... as opposed to a non-paying (F2P) customer. If the game is F2P you have to suck on the things you don't like. If you're a paid subscriber you're entitled to voice your opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instaboosting to 90 when the level max is 100 doesn't help all that much for PvP. Sure, you could then grind through 10 levels to 100, but that'll take a little bit of time (a few weeks likely for the average player).<br />
<br />
You also have to remember that the type of players who go for FOTM in PvP already have many characters (since they tend to jump around a lot), most who are almost max level anyway. The insta-90s aren't for them.<br />
<br />
The Insta-90s are for people who haven't played since WotLK and are trying to come back to the game. They might have one or two 70s, and that's about it, but so much in the game has changed since then maybe they want to try a new class. They find their friends, reconnect and insta-90 a Monk and join their guild. THAT is who this is for.<br />
<br />
I'm probably the definition of casual, but I've also played the game off and on in every expansion, and I just checked. I have two 90s, five characters in the mid 80s and five in the mid 70s. The only class I didn't have that was over 50 was a Monk (at 45) and Warlock (I've tried many times, but I jut can't get into that class at all). <br />
<br />
So I decided to play my lvl 45 monk yesterday, with heirlooms I hit 53 in a few hours. <br />
<br />
If they give me a free 90, sure I'll use it, but I'd never pay for one since other than the Monk, I already have at least one of each class that is within spitting distance to 90 (or there already). Most players are like this.<br />
<br />

<br />
But don't mind me, keep spewing garbage about slippery slope fallacies.<br />
<br />
The &quot;slippery slope&quot; began six years ago with TCG, and has moved all the way to mounts, pets and vanity transmog items. At that pace, by about 2020, when WoW is in year 16 we'll see the first item on the store that actually benefits a player in game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duster505</div><div class="date">2014-01-30, 05:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No it is not. <br /> 
It has 0 impact on gameplay if leveling is as trivial and meaningless as it is now.<br />
<br />
Selling gear would be pay to win in PvP.<br />
<br />
I'm not entirely sure if pay to win even exists in the realm of PvE. <br />
It would only be a &quot;pay to win faster&quot; because you win anyway.<br />
<br />
Exactly... the issue is meaningless leveling content. Blizzard decided to not improve the gameplay... just create a grind like the F2P games do... and then charge extra.<br />
<br />
There is plenty of Pay to win in PVE. Blizzard is doing just like every f2p game is doing. It is giving players the power to pay for less grind. The difference.... is that Blizzard is already charging players 15$ per month. And this pay to win (there is no doubt about that fact) just goes to show that the game really isn't worth the sub in the first place.<br />
<br />
The logic that its not pay to win cause it isn't giving you the best possible stuff in the game - is just plain stupid. Blizzard crossed the line already and there is no stopping them now. Players paying for old tier gear when new raid comes? I can see that happen as early as next expansion. We are ALREADY paying for gear since the lvl 90s come with their set of gear.<br />
<br />
It's over. PPL just have to admit it that WOW is now focused on milking as much as possible. Gameplay and core parts of RPG systems don't matter anymore. And instead of improving those features and making a good solid leveling curve that isn't focused on repetitive and outdated content... they go the other way... and make it more grindy and then charge for lvl 90s. That should tell most of the players where this game is heading.<br />
<br />

How much do you want to bet that within the next year or two you will be able to purchase previous tier PVP and PVE sets from the shop as a &quot;catch up&quot; method. This is definitely not a far fetched or outrageous idea. And the fanbois will all defend it with the same bullshit idiot nonsense that they defend the purchasable level 90's. &quot;Its just so people dont log in and say, oh man I need to gear up first before I can play with my friends.&quot; Hogshit. Its gonna happen. Mark my words.<br />
<br />
Buying previous tier raid and PVP gear will happen in WOD. There is zero difference between buying already geared up lvl 90... and buying those items. They ARE already selling gear now with the lvl 90. As long as its not the very best... the logic will stick with every other item that is put in the store.<br />

<br />
Cata's end game? the 99% health reduction raid they wanted everyone to See? I dont know about Wrath . But Cata had a bad end raid. atleast SoO has some fun Fights which arent just a dps check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are right about Cata. The last cata-raid was really just a dps check...much more than firelands(which is why countless raids still fail and fall apart in firelands).<br />
I ain't so sure about SoO tho....if we got twice the health and 4times the dps we got now...I think it will be as easy as the last cata-raid. Most of the mechanics just won't cut it anymore then(I was in a flex yesterday and garrosh just teleported us ONCE before going down. So these fights become extremely easy too once you really out-dps them).</div></div><hr />

I do like how people suddenly make the jump to legendary weapons being in the store... you guys need new hobbies. Stop stalking a game you no longer enjoy.<br />

Then new players wouldn't have to go through all that crap and nobody would have to be nickle and dimed f2p style in a p2p game. But you keep defending their greed, you must be a shareholder.<br />
<br />
As for the button. Sometimes a guildie will invite me to something on the calendar. There have been times where I've tried to just ignore it but that glowing question mark at the top right gets extremely annoying so I end up just going up and hitting decline. Like another poster here said, it won't be long until specials will be in the store and it will glow on and off till you click it. We all know it's coming.<br />
<br />
As for pay to win. There is no way to win this game. Pay to win is someone who has money having an advantage over someone who doesn't. Sub fees are supposed to make everyone equal. Someone who has more money and is able to skip 90 levels of content is having an advantage. That's a few weeks of resets to get gear, get legendary drops, get into a raid group etc. If they want people to skip all that content they should make it equal and remove it all. Rip off the Rift scaling feature and allow us to lower our levels and go back and do the content optionally if we want.<br />

Bolded the pertinent part that anybody who's taken the most basic business class at any level of education should be having a chuckle over. Why would you ever, EVER, give away a service that people will pay for?<br />

Make no mistake, people WILL pay for this. Whether it's new players who want to jump straight into WoD (and are paying for it by buying the game and every expansion, getting the free boost for character #1) or old players who've always wanted to try out a priest, but haven't got the time/patience to level one to cap, or what not. Blizzard's in-game shop is a license to print money. Why would they just give all that away? Try making sense, please.<br />
<br />
Also, there are already specials, genius, and the button is no more obtrusive. Keep grasping at stupid straws.</div></div><hr />

I said it would glow when there are specials, genius. Take the stupid straw out of your mouth and use it to point to me where there is a glowing button. Also by your stupid revelation they could take everything out of the game and make you pay extra for it. Why give us raids when they can make you pay? Think before you post.<br />

So long story short on the shop buttons, &quot;we like the money we make from people and could care less if a small amount of people are against our transition to a p2p game with full f2p shop features&quot;. I have never played a f2p game worth mentioning that shoves the shop in your face as much as blizz seems to want to lately. If they're just trying to hold out till the inevitable f2p and make as much money as they can before then, then that is their decision, it is not however a decision I will continue to support.<br />
<br />
If they really cared about the people who didn't want to see the buttons then they should have had an option that hides them, not shove it down your throat on multiple screens that they don't even want addons to hide anymore.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I mean they already cram down our throats those annoying buttons that allow us to see the credits, and previous cinematics. I mean.. geez, That little button on the bottom left of my screen is more than I can possibly take for the 2 seconds it takes me to select a character. /stupidity /sarcasm</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Old Republic, a legitimately free-to-play game re-tooled around microtransactions as the bulk of their revenue stream: ONE shop button. No shop button on the launcher, login screen, or the escape menu. Just the one single cartel market button at the top of the UI. Yes, there are other ways the market is integrated into the UI but one has to actually dig for them.<br />
<br />
As of the next patch, Warcraft, a pay-to-play game, will have THREE in-game shop buttons and a near persistent news &quot;link&quot; via the launcher to the web version of the shop.<br />
<br />
Do people see why there are legitimate complaints now? Blizzard is shoving their shop in our faces more than most F2P games do. <br />
It smacks of desperation and greed.<br />

<br />
You were making a decent, if not entirely valid, argument until you put in &quot;/stupidity&quot;.<br />
<br />
But, hey, if you want to play the ad hominem game: As soon as you typed your little &quot;/stupid&quot; remark, you advertised yourself as a Blizzard sycophant. Blizzard could bend you over and have their way with you and you'd be happy to let them do it again. In fact, that's precisely what they're doing. They want you to buy into f2p/b2p microtransactions while still being a p2p game. And little worker ants like you defend it tooth and nail, proving, again, that P.T. Barnum knew what he was talking about.</div></div><hr />

P.S inc a lot of fotm Rollers that are just going to QQ about how their mains class is being underrepresented.<br />
<br />
yeah, because that doesn´t happen now.<br />

I think the reasoning behind it is what makes it seem bad, they are basically saying &quot;yeah people did not want shop buttons in game so they covered it up with addons we don't want that, so let's make a shop buttong that every one sees and can't remove only grey out&quot;<br />
.<br />
<br />
Or perhaps they wanted a shop button at the character selection screen, where you know, you would have that lvl 1 character that you wanted to boost.</div></div><hr />

I have the right to complain about whatever the fuck I want. Only here would people be praised for not liking something but staying silent and bending over and taking it. In the rest of the world it's a sign of strength when you stick up for something you don't like. If the cable company is screwing you I don't see legions of cable company fanboys whining about how you should just shut up and that the cable company is just trying to make tv better bla bla bla. You need a reality check. When the cook at your restaurant screws up your steak you're welcome to shut the hell up and take it and not complain. Some of us have a spine and voice our opinions and tell the cook to make a new steak. We're allowed to do that no? I mean this is a discussion forum is it not?<br />
<br />
Wow. You're not the easiest type of person to get along with huh. I get it, you hate when people screw you over. I hate it too. However, getting all rage faced and foaming at the mouth in public isn't the best way to get what you want. If your cable company is screwing you over, you know what you can do? Cancel your subscription. If your restaurant fucks up your steak? Leave and don't come back. Being a whiny little brat and crying over little things instead of manning up and working with the cards you're dealt or leaving without making a scene is never a good idea. However, I get your passion, and I appreciate it. In these 2 examples you have every right to be this upset because they're personally fouling you. Blizzard is making a business decision that's affecting ALL OF US. Not just the ones that are in disagreement. You can be upset, but don't think that Blizzard is personally screwing you over. Be a man, cancel your sub, take your money elsewhere. The ones that can roll with the punches will stick around and have a better experience with people like you gone.</div></div><hr />

Oh look, here's another one whining about the whining. It's fun jumping to conclusions and playing make believe in your head and resorting to personal insults and attacks huh? When you can grow up and make a point without doing all of that get back to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
even f2p games dont beg you this much to use their store.<br />
<br />
THREE icons (and growing). why dont we just have a store popup on loading screens and after using any ability?<br />
<br />
So invasive I never even mentioned any of them while playing so far. I don't even know where these THREE icons are.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure you get to complain about people who are acting exactly the way you are and somehow try and take the maturity high ground. <br />
<br />
But let's get to your &quot;why can't I complain about my steak&quot; analogy, and why it's horrible. When I go to a steakhouse, the steak is the single most important part of my meal. For someone who cares about PvP, PvP might be WoW's steak. If I'm a raider, PvE Raid Content would be the equivalent of the steak. A tiny button that only shows up on the default UI and another button by the Add Ons button on the character select screen (which I didn't even notice) is not the steak, if anything it's a bad piece of parsley on the side of the plate.<br />
<br />
Now, you might hate that piece of parley, and that's fine. But if you ordered a steak, and it was cooked exactly how you wanted, it had the side you wanted, and there was a piece of parsley on the plate you didn't like, would you also embarrass yourself and make a stink of over it? Maybe, but you can't get mad when other restaurant goers tell you to calm down or snicker at you while you do it. <br />
<br />
If you are one of the dozens of people in this thread who apparently are no longer playing (someone claimed they quit before Cataclysm, so 4 years ago yet they are still posting about it), then the parsley is of no concern since you aren't even in the restaurant.</div></div><hr />

How? What are you winning with an instant level 90?</div></div><hr />

You win time . We start both on a new server. I will buy a character , you level one . <br />
Untill you are at lvl 90 , I will already gathered iLevel gear. <br />
We apply both to a guild , I will have 40 iLevels more then you , guess who will get denied .</div></div><hr />

A place where you can buy a few novelty pets/mounts/helms that in no way affect gameplay? Ohhh noooo. Such a slippery slooope! Before you know it the entire game will be buying legendaries! Because, you know, .. we've been slipping down this slope so much! I mean, you started out with the TCG being able to buy mounts and clickie items .. and we slipped down that slope so far we now can buy MOUNTS ... and PETS! What's next, you greedy bastards?! Will we be able to buy special HAIR CUTS?! TOO FAR IS TOO FAR! /shakesfistsangrilyattheheavens<br />
I never agreed with WoW having a TCG.<br />
<br />
A subscription is supposed to offer accessibility to all that is a part of the game* (not &quot;gimme&quot; but opportunity). Having things exclusive to the TCG and Blizzard Store goes against that core concept. I believe that Blizzard either ought to have alternative means of obtaining them, or switch to the F2P model. As it currently stands, WoW has become something of an unfortunate hybrid.<br />
<br />
<br />
*Just to be clear, I am fine with the exclusivity of things attached to Blizzcon and Collector's Edition.</div></div><hr />

If that is your definition of play to win, then so is character transfers, heirlooms, RAF, grouping with friends, having more time to play, etc. Your thinking is incredibly flawed. <br />
<br />
First off, I imagine @frodoh already has 90s (or nearly 90) all over the place, so he/she could always just transfer one over which has existed for years. Secondly, @frodoh could also take advantage of other boosting like RAF and get a 90 in 3 days and easily pass you on the way to 100.<br />
<br />
This is a perfect example of being mad about something first, then scrambling to justify the anger after the fact when called on it.<br />

TCG was released 7.5 years ago. So in 7.5 years, the slippery slope people have been dreading has barely slipped or sloped. They sell a few vanity items. Would I rather it not exist? Sure, but all of this &quot;mark my words in WoD you'll be able to buy full level 100 toons with raid gear!&quot; talk is irrational garbage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SniperCT</div><div class="date">2014-02-01, 08:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have already leveled 7 alts to 90, and I would like a button to pay for the other 6 because there really isn't anything more for me to experience levelling-wise. <br />
<br />
Supply, meet demand.<br />
<br />
This is me and my wife.<br />
<br />
She has 4 90s and 1 at 89, I have 3 at 90 and 2 almost there. We both have a half-dozen characters between 80 and 86.<br />
<br />
We are more than willing to pay to boost them to 90, so for WoD we can have our pick of which characters we want to play. We've already played levels 1-90 to death. We've already done RAF several times (for the mount but also the boost).<br />
<br />
And that doesn't count the 4 or 5 'throw away' 80 and 85 paladin and warriors I've made for tanking/healing an RAF friend up.<br />
<br />
So bring on my boosts to 90!</div></div><hr />
