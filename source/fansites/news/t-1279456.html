DREAM Paragon Heroic Lei Shen 10 Man World First<br />
Congratulations to DREAM Paragon (http://www.wowprogress.com/guild/eu/lightning-s-blade/Paragon) for being the first guild to down Heroic Lei Shen 10! <br />

<br />
Oondasta Health Reduction<br />
Keep in mind that Oondasta mechanics will change once again in Patch 5.3 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3177-Patch-5-3-PTR-Notes-Preview).<br />
Lead Encounter Designer Ion &quot;Watcher&quot; Hazzikostas noticed this thread last night and has these thoughts to share:<br />
<br />
Yes, Oondasta's maximum health has been reduced by 50%. The design intent behind this boss was for the primary audience to be guilds rather than pickup groups. That is why we placed Oondasta on a relatively remote island, surrounded by powerful elite dinosaurs that make solo travel in the area a dicey proposition. It's why he has mechanics that will outright kill you without the coordinated use of cooldowns, and careful positioning. It's a very different philosophy than our approach to designing bosses like Sha of Anger or Nalak. Of course, things didn't exactly play out as we envisioned -- as we all know, it was possible to overwhelm Oondasta with sheer numbers. While not intended, that was not entirely negative. There have been some pretty epic experiences on the Isle of Giants in the last couple of weeks. There's something to be said for the sight of a hundred spells and missiles flying through the air at a huge dinosaur. <br />
<br />
We could have made a number of changes that would have made this approach entirely impossible: Consider a version of Oondasta with a Spiritfire Beam that could hop to 99 targets instead of 20, and a Doomwalker-style debuff that prevented players who had died during the encounter from re-engaging. Definitely not zergable. But that doesn't mean that people would stop trying, and the result would likely be a boss that no one could kill, and a frustrating experience for most participants. So we didn't do that. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, while our server hardware is much, much more powerful than what we had in place during the days of events like the Opening of Ahn'Qiraj years ago, it still has limits. And what we have increasingly been observing was players massing around Oondasta in such great numbers that it brought servers to their knees. As word spreads that Oondasta has spawned, more and more people flock to the Isle of Giants for a piece of the action. Many people have been in Oondasta fights where spells took multiple seconds to cast, and the dinosaur perhaps stopped using its abilities entirely. Players with anything but the very best computers saw nothing but a slideshow. And in extreme cases, the entire continent of Pandaria crashed. That simply isn't an acceptable experience for our players, and so we reduced Oondasta's health, so that smaller groups are more likely to be successful, and he'll likely die before so many players arrive that it degrades the experience for everyone present. If server capacity were limitless, we wouldn't have made any of these changes, but alas that is not the case.<br />
<br />
Oondasta clearly did not deliver on our original expectations. We'll apply the lessons learned from this experience to any future world bosses we add.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
In terms of PvP this is one of the worst patches i've ever witnessed in 4 years of playing. Healers are virtually invincible.<br />
Whenever we tone down burst, this is a risk (and why we often nerf burst so gently). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/313710555452018688))<br />
<br />
Dang does this mean it'll be like vanilla again where PVE geared folks can do just as good in PVP with their PVE gear? Hope so<br />
Two pieces with the same ilevel means PvP Power wins. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315488457239699456))<br />
<br />
how about world pvp? How about duels. I practice my skills in duels for arena. Soon raid gear will be king. Bad change.<br />
When is the last time you engaged in world PvP with a fair setup on both sides? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315487457133072384))<br />
with the change on 65% resil on players. not having pvp power should look abysmally bad for pvers tryin to join bg<br />
Not necessarily. They will blow up less but won't be able to put out as much damage. Better design hopefully. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315490673186983937))<br />
<br />
Is 5.3 coming before arena season ends?<br />
Yes. New seasons coincide with new raid tiers, and there is not one in 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315489396231110656))<br />
<br />
From a former SWTOR player, easy way to fix AFKing in bg - reward honor for personal performance (medals), not for win/loss.<br />
Guarding a flag can be a huge benefit to the team but doesn't score well (and is easy to fake). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315484921856663552))<br />
<br />
Now that PvP items don't give resi, how do you ensure heroic raid loot doesn't make its way to arenas? #shadowmourne<br />
That answer is in the patch notes, but we are preparing a blog next week that will explain our intentions with all of this. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315483335428304897))<br />
<br />
If this situation goes, PvP users must raid to win PvP fight. We don't want this situation. plz think about Asia PvP users.<br />
We have a plan. It should also help with the fact that you can ugprade 5.3 PvE gear but not PvP gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315210027357061120))<br />
<br />
when are you guys gonna talk about balancing random bg's to have an amount of dps healers and tanks instead of wildcard? unfun<br />
Soon (tm). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315208788590342145))<br />

Hearthstone Blue Posts<br />
Purchasing Cards Required?<br />
I just read the FAQ and I extract from it that you have to pay real money for your cards. Kind of like, each time you buy a booster, you do it with real money. And that defeats the purpose for me, because one of the reasons I don't play CCG's is because they're moneysinks.<br />
We really focus the game on being fun first and foremost. You can get in and have fun with it, playing and building decks, for as long as you like. You can buy and open packs to gain cards, but you can also win the same packs just by playing other people. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257510-so-do-i-have-to-pay/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8414831479))<br />
<br />
Game Duration<br />
So I am wondering, will games be shorter or longer on average, can players squeeze a game or two on launch / cofee break or you need to dedicate bit more time to play a game?<br />
Yeah it's about 10-15 minutes. Depending on the classes and card pulls the game lengths can vary quite a bit. It's a good amount of time, even when I lose I'm not as angry because it's not that double-whammy of &quot;I lost AND spent an hour doing it.&quot; Plus I feel like the mechanics of the game and the matchmaking make it feel satisfying. Pretty rare I feel like I was just utterly decimated, and even then the game is just fun to look at and listen to... (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257514-what-average-game-duration-do-you-aim-for/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8414741447))<br />
<br />
Trading Cards<br />
Will players be able to trade cards with each other or not?<br />
Right, we're really focusing on players building up their own collections and playing the game. If you have duplicates there's a crafting system, which allows you to break down (disenchant) what we call Expert cards and then use the subsequent Arcane Dust to craft new cards. <br />
<br />
Expert cards are those you get from opening packs (packs are either won or purchased), or the ones you choose and get to keep if you win a game in The Forge. Basic cards are ones you earn just by playing a class, win or lose. Expert cards are denoted by a rarity jewel in the center of them. You can see both types in the screenshot here (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/static/images/media/screenshots/ss2-full.jpg). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257526-is-this-a-tcg/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8414121812))<br />
<br />
Game Formats<br />
One thing I enjoy in all TCG is the limited format - that is to create a deck from cards you get from boosters and only those cards you open, rather than constructed decks. Will this format be in Hearthstone?<br />
Yup, you're looking for The Forge! You &quot;buy into&quot; a game with packs of cards, which you could have earned by just playing others (or purchased, if you so choose), you and your opponent draft a deck with randomly presented cards, and if you win your Forge match you get to keep all the cards you chose to play with as well as some additional unopened packs. The specifics of that may change throughout testing of course, but that's the premise. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257546-limited-format/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8415171706))<br />
<br />
Mana Progression<br />
I think one of the main drawbacks of the MTG series is countering unlucky starts with the proper ratio of mana (which is why you have mulligan rules generally when you play) but I really like how HeartStone seems to be taking a proactive role in pushing forward mana progression.<br />
A 10 mana game is a long game in my experience, most of mine end around turn 7 or 8. It's going to depend on the players and the hero and deck comps, of course. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257549-mana-progression/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8414741703))<br />
<br />
Android Availability<br />
We’re looking into the possibility of supporting additional platforms in the future, but it's not something we have any info to share on just yet. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257550-i-want-this-for-android-also/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8415171469))<br />
<br />
Future Game Modes<br />
Similar to the WoW: TCG, is there any plan on implementing in the future possible Dungeon and/or RAID formats? Either something that pits a group of players online against a single player (with special deck/enhancements/boss) or an AI?<br />
We're focusing on the 1v1 dueling format right now, but certainly we'll be looking into many different ways to build upon and evolve the game after release. We want to get the game into your hands as soon as possible! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257551-dungeon-and-raid-formats-in-the-future/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8414181643))<br />
<br />
Explanations in the UI<br />
Not to keep using this example, but something similar to Duels of the Planeswalker. During a game, you can check out cards in play/in your hand/in graveyards and get a detailed description of them. You can check out each card's abilities and see what each ability does. Like, I know what Taunt does, but can we highlight something like Taunt, and it explain what it does?<br />
If not then we probably missed something! Everything should either be self explanatory or explained within the game. You're not going to have to come to the forums and ask &quot;rules experts&quot; or judges how cards or mechanics work. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257556-will-the-ui-explain-what-abilities-do/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8414741597#3))<br />
<br />
Battle.Net Integration<br />
Does Hearthstone work with Battle.net?<br />
It does use Battle.net, and will use your existing (BattleTag and RealID) friends lists for chatting with and challenging your friends. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257557-does-hearthstone-work-with-battlenet/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8414271728#2))<br />
<br />
Number of Cards<br />
They're 30 card decks (minimum and maximum), and two maximum of any one card. There are over 300 cards to collect, meaning over 600 to build out a 'complete' collection if you want two of each.<br />
<br />
Edit: Actually, you can only have one of each Legendary so slightly less than 600 total to collect, but if you include Golden cards then you're up near 1200 I suppose. Anyway... a lot of cards. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257560-deck-card-number/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8414571441#12))<br />
<br />
Chatting With Opponents<br />
Will we be able to communicate with our opponents either during or post game?<br />
You can chat with people on your friends list (RealID and BattleTag), and you can challenge them to friendly duels.<br />
<br />
You can't chat with opponents not on your friends list met in normal matches (those found through the Play matchmaker), but we have emotes built in that allow you to use a series of predetermined taunts and remarks. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/257568-cannot-chat-with-opponent/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/8415171966))<br />
<br />
<br />
Hearthstone Tweets<br />
Will Hearthstone have player to player trading ? Does Hearthstone have any synergy with cryptozoic TCG? loot cards for WoW?<br />
We're looking into a few possibilities as far as Hearthstone interacting with World of Warcraft, but nothing to announce right now. (Source (https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/315219484321406978))<br />
<br />
I've been playing wowtcg since Azeroth. I'm excited about hearthstone, will there be additional class heroes after beta?<br />
We're focusing on the original 9 for now, but certainly we'll be looking to grow the game in the future. (Source (https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/315468180069969920))<br />
<br />
Where are the packs going to be sold at? In game, Blizzard store?<br />
They're purchasable within the game itself. (Source (https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/315527446722121728))<br />
Any word on using our Blizzard balance?<br />
Yup, on PC and Mac you'll be able to use Battle.Net Balance to purchase card packs.<br />
<br />
Hey, uhm, do you have a special like, level of requirements that you need to be in the beta? With the computer specs?<br />
We don't know yet what the minimum specs are, but rest assured the game runs on a very wide variety of hardware. (Source (https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/315837628392038400))<br />
<br />
At the Forge, you have to win your duel to win the cards you would normally earn?<br />
You keep playing until you get 20 wins or 3 losses, and each additional win rewards you with more unopened packs. (Source (https://twitter.com/PlayHearthstone/status/315916085587218432))<br />

According to Blizzard Lei Shen is considered the end boss of the tier. Ra'den is merely a &quot;bonus level&quot;. That's why the title is awarded by Lei Shen.</div></div><hr />

Just means pvp gear will be good for pvp but you wont get insta gibbed for starting the grind in pve gear (at the same time you won't deal as much dmg as a full pvper vs a full pver.) But pve ilvl is higher you might say! Well they are downscaling the pve gear in pvp. So its pretty simple item 1 ilvl 496 has blah blah stats with x pvper power, item 2 ilvl 522 has the same stats minus the pvp power and is scaled down to the same ilvl. <br />
<br />
<br />
Moral of the story pvp gear &gt; pve gear but it will be easier for entry pvp instead of getting killed in a cheap shot</div></div><hr />

Sha of Anger and (to a bit of a lesser extent) Galleon were alright as far as world bosses go, but I still believe that the concept of world bosses in general doesn't work. From my perspective, it's either VoA-style or go back to where there was no &quot;loot piñata&quot; at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really, you don't consider Paragon a &quot;real&quot; guild? That's laughable, even IF you consider 25mans harder (and I don't want to touch that one with a barge pole, they certainly take more coordination outside, but you also have far less class representation and far more individual responsibility etc, it's apples and oranges), they're still better raiders and a better guild than 99% of the people out there. Calling Paragon &quot;not good enough&quot; basically leaves you with Method.</div></div><hr />

I never really liked Blizzard's attempt at dealing with players in T3 sets trampling others in PvP by gear alone. Although it was kind of nice for my shaman while soloing a difficult quest (like A Gift for Voren'thal (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/10508-a-gift-for-vorenthal))... Too bad the old version of resilience had to go bye-bye; made the secondary stat more tolerable.<br />
<br />
Hope the change will narrow the gap in PvP gameplay between those wearing PvE or PvP gear, while still rewarding those who are wearing the &quot;correct&quot; set.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're removing resil, but keeping pvp power, so the guy in the pvp set should still have a distinct advantage. Honestly, I don't know if I like the change either, but at least it shows they're trying to solve their terrible pvp balance, even if it means breaking convention.</div></div><hr />

When you saying that they are first to kill him, you implicitly comparing them to other guilds including those who raid in 25-man format. But that's quite inaccurate comparision because of multiple reasons including different encounter difficulties, diffirent logistics difficulties and other factors. It's better not to start useless flame war and just accept that those are totally different formats with different bosses and diffirent progresses which happened to look similar.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand no other guild can score &quot;general&quot; WF anymore so 25man WF would not be any exciting at all. Feels like Paragon should come back to 25man raiding and bring back the joy of spectating WFs.

Well, keep the passive 65% as they intend to, but I'd like to add a fair few changes.<br />
<br />
First off, as said, resilience on weapons only, and a great deal more power on the rest and far more set bonuses to make PvP gear act better in PvP than PvE gear. Make it 8 set, that way you can have loads of fun designing and balancing.<br />
On gloves you have an addition, like for warriors: &quot;Hamstring cost 10 less rage&quot; or something, which is great. You can always add that to more items as well, to make them more attractive in PvP.<br />
It won't hurt to add more stamina to the gear as well, as a defense. More HP = staying alive longer, which is always attractive in PvP.<br />
<br />
In my honest opinion, resilience has never worked out that well. Yes, it made the difference between PvP and PvE, but it has caused alot of problems as well. Most of the time made PvE gear better in PvP in most cases (i.e legendaries, certain trinkets, set bonuses etc to reach a certain cap to make you become a god).<br />
<br />
I like these new changes. Although not perfect, it's a step in the right direction to finally try and balance out PvP and its stats.<br />
<br />

Yeah but no one gives a shit what Blizzard has to say, if they want to matter at all for raiding progression they should have the progression leaderboard up on their website. 13/13hm is still going to be the race imo, another boss is another boss it'll count towards progression just like other limited atempt bosses did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is basically what Blizzard is going to realize in a few months also. Sha worked, everything else won´t. Galleon didn´t work until he became like Sha. Having a hard boss located at a distant place won´t work ( impossible for small realms, zergable by large ones). <br />

But that's quite inaccurate comparision because of multiple reasons including different encounter difficulties, diffirent logistics difficulties and other factors. It's better not to start useless flame war and just accept that those are totally different formats with different bosses and diffirent progresses which happened to look similar.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that Dream Paragon states pretty strongly that 10M raiding doesn´t matter as far as progression goes. 25 is king... oh wait, that was back when they were 25M and worried about getting beat by 10M raids.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but it is the truth. If encounters are balance, then you still have to say 25M wins because if they dumped their worse dps and healers, they would have an easier time with 10M.</div></div><hr />

Why are they hypocrits? Can you refer me to the post where a Paragon member officially states that 10man is the new 25man?<br />
According to the website they just say 12/13 Lei-Shen down, just like on irc.<br />

There is no guild with a better track record. Anyone disputing the 10/25 raid size must be forgetting they were the best 25man guild for the modern tiers and most difficult encounters in the game. Either way, it requires amazing play and strategy and they deserve every bit of it. <br />

someone is angry that their favourite guild didn't get world first heroic lei shen kill. seriously enough with this &quot;10 man doesn't count&quot; crap, if you hadn't noticed, since Cata all the raid achievements are now 1, no more &quot;double dragon 10 man&quot; or &quot;the abyss will gaze back at you 25 man&quot; along with heroic end bosses being 1 achi, GET.

Mmk so how do you define a world first then?? This is the first guild that we know of that has taken down Heroic Lei Shen so it is a world first and it don't make one iota of difference what size the raid was. They got there first before anyone else.</div></div><hr />

but with the reduced respawn timer you don't have to run to that isle as soon as oondasta is spawned as you can do it 2 hours later again. I thin this is the real reason why it will be much less stressful.</div></div><hr />

Since they did it in 10 man raid size, it is a 10 man world first. As there'll be a 25 man world first, when the boss dies. Stop comparing 10 man to 25 man, especially Lei Shen is harder on 25 man, because of the limited space you've to spread out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I won't even try to convince anyone that 10 man raiding matters more or as much as 25 man equivalent because there is no simple answer but could you please point out the hypocrisy to me? In what way has Paragon as a guild been hypocritical? There has been a few official statements about individual encounters in the past but being a smart guy you probably know that those were indeed about specific encounters, they were quite long time ago when Blizzard was still learning their new philosophy where 10 and 25 man are considered equal and... no, even if Paragon as a guild would have totally bashed 10 man accomplishments in the past (which it did not), it still wouldn't make it hypocrisy to switch raid size.<br />
<br />
Edit: It is however a bit funny for people to call either difficulty easier when 8 guilds have even seen the boss on one raid size (2 in 10 man, 6 in 25) and grand total of 0 has reached it with both raid sizes.</div></div><hr />

Do the sports you mentioned share the same rules? No I thought so... Are they in the same league? No I thought so.... Are both 10 man and 25 in the same league/game?

The definition of a world first is to achieve something for the first time worldwide. Paragon did this. They killed Lei Shen for the first time ever on heroic mode. Meaning they got an overall world first (first time Lei Shen died on heroic ever) and world first 10 man. The world first 25man is obviously up for grabs. But you can't deny that Paragon is the guild who first defeated Lei Shen on heroic difficulty in the world, regardless of the fact that he might be harder or easier in 10 man compared to 25 man (a discussion I wont be getting into).<br />
<br />
The first man ever to travel faster than 100 kmph would be considered a world first, regardless how he did it. I'm not going to go and look up facts, but let's assume he did this by using a car. A few years later a guy comes around and achieves the same thing but using a bicycle. This doesn't mean that the first guys world first is invalid just because it was easier, it means the second guy would have achieved world first +100 kmph with a bicycle. Same thing can be applied here. Paragon got world first Lei Shen HC.</div></div><hr />

Everyone agrees that the races are separate. <br />
Everyone should agree that Paragon kill is a world first because they are the first to kill Lei Shen, and that's not something you can argue about.<br />
And while Paragon are probably not caring about 25m progress, because they are on a different race, I'm pretty sure being the first in the world to kill him feels pretty damn good.<br />
Same goes for 25m guilds: 10m progress doesn't count much for them, but knowing they lost the chance of being the first to see Ra-Den will make their first kill a bit less epic.</div></div><hr />

This is the Worst statement ever 25mans are stupid eazy compaired to 10 mans you can carry a few fuck ups and baddies in a 25 man raid even on heroic all 10 people in a 10 man have to be skilled and not compleat fuck ups and still pull the high dmg you see in the 25 mans yes the boss's may have more health but there are 15 extra people to do the dmg that needs to be done to say that Dream Paragon is not a real raiding guild is compleatly retarded obviously you have never raided in a hardcore 10 man progression group nor a 25 man</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There shouldn't even be any type of argument. World first is exactly what it means, The first in the World to do it. You can't have two World firsts, otherwise, it wouldn't really be World 1st.. <br />
<br />
Paragon has World 1st Heroic Lei Shen kill.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you can categorize it in different ways, but in generality, the real World First respect goes to Paragon. <br />
<br />
Just like Skall was saying. It can be different variations, but it all gets drawn back to the same thing. Like, say someone was the World First person to solve a Rubix cube, and he did it in 5 minutes. Then someone comes along and solves it, Being World 2nd to solve the Rubix cube, but he did it under 5 minutes. So technically he's World First to solve the Rubix cube in under 5 minutes. But the first guy is STILL the World First person to solve a rubix cube and the 2nd guy is World 2nd to solve it.<br />
<br />
So yeah, whoever kills Lei Shen on 25 heroic first will have World First Lei shen, but it will be World First Lei Shen on 25H. <br />
<br />
So, if you enjoy categorizing so much. Paragon has:<br />
World First Lei Shen Heroic<br />
World First Heroic Lei Shen 10 Man Heroic. <br />
<br />
25 man guild(assuming they kill it world 2nd):<br />
World Second Heroic Lei Shen. <br />
World First Heroic Lei Shen 25 man Heroic.<br />
<br />
Yes, i agree. They are two totally different races. But I'm pretty sure even the people participating in the races will agree that a World First IS a World First. No matter the size.</div></div><hr />

I think you people have a hard time telling the difference between 10 and 25 because it has the same name for the bosses..but in reality they are two different encounters... There are two different world firsts because you can't compare 10 and 25 fights with each other</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sil</div><div class="date">2013-03-25, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since they did it in 10 man raid size, it is a 10 man world first. As there'll be a 25 man world first, when the boss dies. Stop comparing 10 man to 25 man, especially Lei Shen is harder on 25 man, because of the limited space you've to spread out.<br />
<br />
Sorry but for me and a lot of other the race ended, you live in your own world.<br />
10 person raiding is also less forgiving and tuned more tightly.<br />
Let's take this into the extreme and expand a little.<br />
Imagine a 1 man raid and a 1000 man raid.<br />
It's easy to balance something for a 1 man raid but the death of that person means its over.<br />
It's difficult to balance something for 1000 man raid so probably it will be more forgiving.<br />
And it is.. because you'll be perfectly fine to be able to down that boss also with 990 men.<br />
Therefor, 10 man also has its arguments to be &quot;harder&quot; than 25 man.</div></div><hr />

If ten man progression means faster world kills, I am forseeing the final death of 25 man raiding. Currently the majority of 25mans are top progression guilds. Everyone knows you can take your 10 best players from your 25 man and go get faster progression in 10. So maybe 25s will be used to gear while ten mans are done for the world first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also if death 'n taxes, nihilium, sk, and whatnot could have keeped their players you might not have ever heard of Paragon, so that argument is not very good either. <br />

What if Blood Legion, Method etc. take their 10 best players and go 10 man? They would probably still get beaten by Paragon, so what is your point? Are you trying to prove that those 25man guilds have 10 better players than Paragon?<br />
<br />
From what I've seen from videos and streams of those so called &quot;25man HC worlds top players&quot;, most of them are utter shit and can't stand a chance in a hardcore 10 man setting. These &quot;top players&quot; include very well known players from various guilds, but I won't start pointing fingers here. All I can say that the healers in 25man guilds are generally full of shit, tanks are sitting ducks and the dps can't do anything else but spam their dps rotation. No multitasking involved whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I guess that was enough rant from me.<br />
<br />
PS. And before you start flaming me, I don't mean all players from 25man hc guilds are shit. But many of them are. Their individual skills are shit, they just have the willpower and time to race for the world firsts. But that doesn't make them any better players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So why now dont go 25-man and take aswell world 1st in 25-man..? Since 10-man Fanboys quote 25-man are &gt;@#@$??<br />

<br />
being forced to go 10 man due to many of the guild members quitting the game is now &quot;choosing the easier path&quot; is it? get a fucking clue you abject retard, 10 man is in alot of cases harder than 25, purely because of the amount asked of each individual raid member, in 25 man there will always be 1 or 2 slackers in the group regardless of how good the group as a whole is, it just happens, reading your posts soo far, i would say the closest to end game raiding you have ever seen was steam rolling naxx 25 in t10 badge gear, so yeah, and just to give u some kind of idea, the total raiding population as measured by wowprogress, has shrunk by about 60 thousand from start of cata to current tier, so ofc there is gonna be less ppl raiding 25 man u moron.<br />

Bosses have three times more health and they're generally more interesting to watch. 10 man guilds shouldn't even be competitive when it comes to world firsts.<br />
So, yeah. Grats to Dream Paragon for killing Lei Shen. But I'll just wait for the real raiding guilds to kill him.<br />
<br />
Quite simply, you do not know what you're talking about.</div></div><hr />

Obviously 10/25 world first is difficullt, but it isn't really a question as to which is more difficult. Both can be difficult, but 25-man you're coordinating more people. Both are impressive, but there is a reason 10-man guilds aren't invited to do live raids at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
If you magically transferred all the world raiding guild into a gigantic cross realm server... who do you think have gotten the Realm First achievement spam message?</div></div><hr />

They both have their pros and cons. Dream Paragon consists of raiders who have been at or quite near the top of the raiding ladder for a very, very long time. Their skills dwarf the rest of us. They deserve our props no matter what format they use. Believe it or not, some fights are actually more difficult on 10 than on 25, and vice versa. To put any sort of stamp of approval on a &quot;25 man is harder than 10 man and therefore deserves the real props&quot; post just makes that person ignorant and single minded. The fact of the matter is, Paragon (10 or 25) has always been the one to inch ahead at the end and get the important World First kills...FIRST. Method knows it, Premonition knows it and Blood Legion knows it. They know better than to delude themselves that Paragon doesn't deserve big &quot;grats&quot; for doing what they do. They don't have to like it, but they certainly have to respect it. You people who come on here and try to diss DP for doing something in 10 man...are nothing more than jealous little twerps. Until Blizz comes right out and says that 10 mans are easier and deserve no credit, then life goes on...that's it.</div></div><hr />

no. he just wrote the truth, and opposed to you most people are able to accept that 10 != 25.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone seriously think if Method or BL went 10 man tommorow theyd start taking all the world 1sts? Nah Paragon would still do it like they have been for years. The difficulty difference might be there but its obviously not that significant since its the same guilds as always at the top</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
LOL... I´ve seen more raiding than you ever will see even if you play this game to the end ^^ <br />
<br />
But I bet you and your LFR syndrome club still think that´s raiding, but that´s your problem!<br />
<br />
Cheers kid you made me laugh I´ll give you that.</div></div><hr />

People seem to be unable to change the mindset from when 10m was tuned easier and gave lower ilvl loot.<br />
I'll just say raiding 10m hc is not easier for an individual raider than 25m hc.</div></div><hr />

Dammit, I didn't even think of that &gt;&lt; I was all excited and shit lol. Now I'm holding my breath in hopes that it's NOT a joke. That would be one of the cruelest things they could do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said they got the boss down with way less tries, a week after doing it on 25m.<br />
This means it obviously seemed easier to them BUT:<br />
1. They already know what to do pretty well, having a record of 500(?) wipes on the 25m.<br />
2. They had the gear from the 25 heroic clear + the gear from the 10m clear. I can't remember if they only did Ragnaros on 10m, if it's the case it's even more gear for them.<br />
3. They were able to pick the perfect setup from their 25m rooster, with players only playing their mains.<br />
<br />
It probably WAS easier in 10m than 25m, but even if it was the same difficulty I don't think they were going to wipe that many times.<br />
Could be more interesting to know how many times they wiped on the 2nd kill on 25m, that would be more correct to compare in terms of wipes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems so...<br />
<br />
Blizzard changed the game so much during the years that you now don´t even have to clear an instance to get the rank world first! <br />
<br />
Isn´t that amazing or what???</div></div><hr />
