<br />
WoW Source: Warlords of Draenor<br />
Another episode of WoW Source has been posted. You can find our recap below!<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Story<br />
<br />
The team has been talking about Warlords of Draenor since a few months before the Mists of Pandaria launch. Starting on it so far in advance let them set up the Garrosh story for the next expansion. <br />
One of the ideas tossed around was having different Mongrel Horde races united by Garrosh to attack Azeroth. They realized it would be a cooler story if he was reassembling the old Orcish Horde. Then the team had to decide how it would be done, with one idea being resurrecting all of the old leaders. That would be confusing as far as if they were undead or how everything worked, so the idea of going back to Draenor was decided upon.<br />
Early versions of old Draenor weren't going to use what is now Zangarmarsh for anything, but someone made a concept art of the giant mushrooms underwater that made the team decide to use it after all. <br />
Old Draenor is supposed to be a mix of the familiar and things people have never seen before.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Models<br />
<br />
The new Undead Female model is far along enough to show off, but no animation has been done yet.<br />
There was a bug that made the eye of the Human Female model look different and people got really upset about it, which is why the team is being so careful in building the new models.<br />
The team is looking forward to seeing what machinima authors can do with the new models.<br />
The robe models are a little tired at this point and they haven't been improved as much as the team would like. <br />
The team also looked at making new cloak models that use alpha to mask out some of the cloak to make new shapes.<br />
The team has talked about the different ways they could roll out new character models, including just switching them one day or allowing people to opt out and keep the old ones for performance reasons. <br />
NPCs will also benefit from the new models and get some touchups to fix any custom work that was done that doesn't match the new models and animations. <br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
<br />
Garrisons will take gold and some kind of garrison resource like wood or stone to upgrade.<br />
Garrisons are mostly an individual thing because if it were a guild thing first, the guild leaders would take all of the fun parts. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic Raiding<br />
<br />
A 15 player size was discussed, but the devs are already asking 10 player guilds to grow so they selected the size that would work best going forward. <br />
Mythic raiding was set to 20 because of the advantages it gives the team when designing raids. <br />
With 20 players, raid designers can assume there is at least one of each class in the raid, something that they can't do with a raid size of 15. <br />
Having 20 players also allows for more complex mechanics for the most challenging raid content. <br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
The free boost to level 90 won't expire. You can boost any character to level 90, as there is no level requirement. <br />
Ashran will allow you to collect scraps from other defeated opponents to build something like strong armor, a vehicle, or launch a wave of NPCs at the enemy. Players may even have longer term objectives they can work on that span multiple days.<br />

They haven't animated the model yet, this is the default position for all models. Hence no hunch or open eyelids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It isn't animated, as the news post states.<br />
<br />
Notice the arms sticking out like that? That is likely a model viewer without any animation of the skeleton. Once the animations are put in, the eyes will likely be able to blink/open/glow, and the hunch will be back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The model's posture is like this because its the default T position they take when they have no skeleton/animation put on them.<br />

Cool idea with the cloaks, especially now that they will have better animations. Variety is always good.<br />

<br />
The body doesn't really look that different...like the toes are still weird &gt;.&lt;<br />

oh bullshit. every raid is going to stack warlocks or rogues like they do now. every guild that min/maxes will not be taking 1 of each, if their performance is lacking.<br />
<br />
what they are talking about is creating mechanics that require certain class abilities. Like say a mob that needs to be MC by a priest. Or traps that have to be disarmed, and so on. they can say specific class abilities are needed in a fight and assume you have at last one player who will be handling those things. You can stack outside those parameters for min max, but you will need at least 1 of the class present to perform the action.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's saying a raid size of 20 will most likely have the variety they want it to have, on average, so they can design encounters with all classes in mind. Yes, the highest-end guilds will still compose their raids for minmaxing purposes as expected.</div></div><hr />

Those are not cloaks those are capes at best. Can we get them to look less cardboard/stained glass and more like an actual cloak? Something that comes off the shoulders with more of a regal sense to it as if i just walked into a room and commanded everyones attention with the flick of the cloak.</div></div><hr />

Bones look far better, and the body has actual shape to it.<br />

The problem with the cloak shapes is that the &quot;new&quot; shapes, are lesser in size and detail, thus they look like lower quality loot, have to see what they come up with.<br />

It looked bad when the undead model was originally released and it still looks bad today. No amount of pixels will make something that ruins almost 99% of your gear look good. I use to play undead exclusively back in vanilla, because they where the most neutral model back then. I switched to Belf during BC because I couldn't stand the way your armor/clothes rip because of your joints. Just saying would be cool if they weren't lazy and found another way to make the undead model look, well undead. Other than that it looks pretty good.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I'd love to see a cloak that doesn't look like it's stapled to your shoulder blades. Although IIRC I remember them saying they were adding bones to the cloak models so ragdoll cloaks sounds like it'll be a thing.</div></div><hr />

Yeah regular humans have half their skin rotted off and bones sticking out.<br />

It looks exactly the same as the previous model but updated.<br />

I'm sure you noticed that Undead pretty much ARE human punk females since 2005. They're basically Human, with different posture, and therefore different movement and animations.<br />
<br />
The female picture is in default state, not in it's intended hunched posture it has ingame.</div></div><hr />

In contrast to the old models (while keeping in mind the low poly count) one might be able to imagine that the muscle tissue in those sensitive parts probably atrophied causing a skinny, malnourished look, but the new models look like they've been eating 3 meals a day and working out every day.<br />

If you think they'll attract more players to playing them by making them sag a bit, I think you're a bit out of touch with what attracts your average video game player to playing something. Hint: It's not realism.</div></div><hr />

In a hideous kind of way...<br />

That's pretty damn good considering they wanted to stay true to the old model. The exposed bones look a lot better. The flesh around the bones still looks a bit bad but I suppose that's inevitable. Also the fingertips and toes.<br />
<br />
I want to see how it looks protruding through gear though...<br />

Face good, body looks the same. :(<br />
<br />
Nah look at those bones, huge improvement. And they come through the armour so you'll see them a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
The body doesn't really look that different...like the toes are still weird &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
I do agree about the toes. I'd be happy if they just gave us normal fingers and toes actually.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks as though female undead will be losing their hunch. <br /> 
<br />
And what's up with the eyes? I liked my &quot;empty sockets with glowy discs&quot; look... do we just not have the glow yet?<br />
<br />
This is just a base model those get added after.<br />
<br />
Sheesh can we stop with the highly politicised &quot;hunch&quot; stuff?<br />

<br />
The concept for female undead is clearly Bride of Frankenstein/Morticia Adams/etc, so yeah attractive is the goal.<br />
<br />
By that logic maybe they should make male humans less buff and more fat and ugly? It's silly, this is fantasy, and we only get one model not a bunch of sliders.<br />

<br />
You misunderstand, and that was the point I was trying to make: &quot;Can we keep it?&quot; . The models look so much better when they dont all have scoliosis. I never understood why most of the horde has a hunch (its not a slouch..its a hunch), when the only race that does this is the orc peons...read: PEONS. Somehow down the design line, blizzard thought that having hunched over models made the horde more &quot;beastly&quot; , and went with it; whether they did it to really distinguish the horde from the alliance is arguable ( I would say they did ), but its a terrible design and has no merit for any of the playable races (save the orc peons). <br />
<br />
Case and point, just look at how thrall looks since Cata, that is how the orcs are suppose to look. In all of the art designs and cinematics the orces have been upright and muscular in a more toned fashion , but the orc models in game just use the tired peon model as if the entire race looks like that (with balloon arms and legs. I dont understand how they could design the orcs in an entirely different manner in everything but the in game models ...and yet even 1 of the main models is just like all of the art and cinematics (thrall). On that note, the rest of the horde races like that are just as inconsistent and deformed. Even the undead dont deserve the degree of hunching that they do.</div></div><hr />

Yay for updated hair.<br />

My only nitpick are the exposed joints and knowing that armor will HAVE to show them as they always have done. I see that won't change unfortunately... Lemme guess.

With the panda models, fat responds to gravity and flops around when animation is applied. The same probably applies to the UD female's tissues, so it's going to look stiff until it's fully animated.<br />
<br />
If this leads to them animating the breasts and butts sign me up!</div></div><hr />

Close, but no cigar, Blizz.<br />

You think that's not abundantly clear to the artists working on this? The plague MUTATES you to look like a monster demon zombie, you're not just reanimated, it changes the structure of your body using your flesh and bone as clay to sculpt. Which is why ghouls look so extreme. The plague creates all kinds of different looks and mutations which let's the Forsaken look more like individuals in the artist's designs than random ghoul #3. The bones have mutated in a sense to be armor in places, they aren't intended to just be exposed. Your knowledge of basic anatomy doesn't refute this.</div></div><hr />

Not accurate, as the spine and other exposed bones are not accurate, but they look like they have two joints, not three, and they still look like long cones, not bones. I also wish they would give a small choice to have covered joints, or exposed joints. They might find out that exposed joints is in the minority. I know giving the community a vote could turn out bad, with the vocal minority either getting their way, or bitching about loosing the vote, but I would like to see a vote on things like exposed joints, and horde hunchbacks. Blizzard might be surprised.</div></div><hr />

I'm most likely going to want the all new models, but more choice for people is never a bad thing. On the other hand, if keeping the old models would keep us from getting updated armors (non painted, more flowing capes, etc), then I reckon the old models will have to go.<br />
<br />
If anything it'll be a graphics setting since Blizzard like their games to run on toasters and new models won't help that. While still looking great on people with monster rigs like my Crossfire 7970 machine :D</div></div><hr />

My thoughts exactly :3 Although I'm glad to see varying shapes at the least, and with the new animations independent of character skeletons they'll feel better. Still...they're impractical...and particularly the ones introduced in MoP just look like fancy throws for your couch or rugs like you said.</div></div><hr />

The model's posture is like this because its the default T position they take when they have no skeleton/animation put on them.<br />

you'll get your skull/evil/jawless/etc faces too.<br />

Well the face in the preview and in your image is the same face - and IMO the best looking face for female UD. The new model is great, and the face is alright too.. but I will kinda miss that older face. But I'll wait and see other face options for Fem UD. I have 3 characters with this face o0.</div></div><hr />

I think he was talking about the world pvp zone. There will be a mechanism similar to Altarec Valley where apparently you can release NPC ( or summon them). The 5.1 domination point pvp had a similar thing where you could summon guards for your towers and stuff.<br />

But in your garrison, you can assemble an army of followers, and then send them out to invade dungeons and stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realy dont mean that.. what all fun GL will take? how hard is for you to make a community in the garrison so all get benefits from that and from the main building of the guild?? By making Garrison single player that makes ppl more separate from guild community, its obvious Garrison's will take alot of ppl free time, imagine someone who goes home at 7-8pm (not all kids who dont work) and have 2-3 hours max to play and raid, so raid start normaly at 8est and end 11est pm then he have 1-2 hour max or sometimes less to do dailies, garrison and hc for vp and above all he have more than 1 toon.. NO freaking way.. this person will end to be in rush all the time, you think this is right? but if the garrison its a guild garrison he can or cant support that but he still can have benefits.<br />

On the character creation screen, I would like to see a slider bar for the level of flesh rot. All the way one way it's flesh intact. As the slider moves, the kness and elbows rot away, the skin abrades, the jaw goes slack and hangs limp and with the slider all the way to rot...you become a skeleton.<br />
<br />
<br />
DO THIS!</div></div><hr />

The exposed bones look a lot better, along with the underwear as well so it doesn't look as strange. Wanna see their facial expressions in action.<br />
Also the first cloak kind of reminded me of a bug of some sort getting its wings.</div></div><hr />

--update--<br />
<br />
These cloak models are something I look forward to seeing in the new expansion, except most cloaks look terrible on female blood elfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The changes made to the updated models were extremely drastic, much more so than what Blizzard is doing with the WoW models (If you weren't around the MMO scene in 2000-2001 I suggest you find some comparison shots of the EQ models, it's very interesting). So while many people were keeping the old models on for performance reasons, there was a giant portion of the community that did it simply because they didn't like the new models.<br />
<br />
I feel the latter will not be a popular sentiment for the WoW models update and that people will mainly do it for performance reasons (if there would even be an advantage to FPS in keeping the old models on).<br />
<br />
The way Blizzard is approaching this update is very, very smart. They really want to try to keep the essence and familiarity of the current models and just make them better, not recreate them, which is what Everquest had done. I think this will work in their favor very well. Everquest designers experienced quite a backlash if I remember correctly when the new models came out, it was a pretty big deal.<br />
<br />
So while the option for players to choose which models they want to use is imperative, I don't think we'll really need to use it because of the care the Blizzard designers are putting into this update. They are upgrading, not overhauling.</div></div><hr />

But I thought the female undead model was kind of underwhelming, along with the male undead face and such, it makes them look cleaner, not dirtier. I would much prefer them to look more like they are actually rotting lol.</div></div><hr />
