Warlords of Draenor Survey<br />
A survey was emailed to a small group of players that had a few interesting questions about Warlords of Draenor. (via Rivenwolf) <br />
<br />
You can find a poll (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1430853-Do-you-want-paid-boosted-90-to-be-in-game) on a paid boost to 90 on the forum, as well as a poll (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1430585-Poll-Pricecheck-on-boost-to-90-feature-%28from-Blizzard-survey%29) on the acceptable price, and some discussion (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1430579-Blizzard-s-newest-venture) of the questions. <br />
<br />
<br />
The survey asked about pricing Warlords of Draenor at $39 or $49 with the boost of a character to level 90.<br />
It also asked about pricing Warlords of Draenor at $39 without boost of a character to level 90.<br />
Another question asked what a fair price for the level 90 boost would be. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that as it was described at Blizzcon, you might be able to purchase a copy of Warlords of Draenor and WoW, then get the free level 90 and transfer that character to your main WoW account, which would allow the purchase of level 90 characters in a roundabout way. <br />
The Blizzcon Q&amp;A mentioned that the team has talked about putting a level 90 purchase option in the store.<br />
<br />
Players were also asked if they had purchased the Annual Pass for Diablo 3 and if they would purchase an annual pass now.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
I would love to see weapon skills removed altogether. This far into the game lore cannot support the selectivity<br />
There are significant gameplay reasons for weapon skills, not just lore. For example, loot distribution, among others. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416687537592082432))<br />
Fair enough, will there be at least more options for hybrids then? At the moment boomkin gets stuck with spirit mace.<br />
How do you figure? Moonkins can also use Staves and Daggers, plus the occasional oddity. They have a fair array of options. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416721467825344512))<br />
Being pessimistic about options in WoD, Maces seemed geared for healers in MoP, wouldn't mind seeing my moonkin with a sword :P<br />
Swords and Druids don't really mix. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416722793846153217))<br />
Aye can understand that, how about seeing more 2H maces that aren't down to even more random chances then usual in WoD?<br />
Not sure what you mean; what does randomness have to do with weapon type? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416723186718216192))<br />
<br />
Is there interest in letting a spellcast finish instantly if that spell procs while casting or is that another mechanic entirely<br />
Can you give an example of what you're talking about? I don't understand... Do you mean like Lava Surge or Shooting Stars? (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415231218678910976))<br />
Like Lava Surge, yeah. You start casting Lava Burst (without Lava Surge buff ofc), Lava Surge then procs, Lava Burst fires.<br />
Typically, in that sort of case, we do even better: you finish that cast, then can cast another instant one immediately after. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415232454597697536))<br />
We can't always be that generous, due to burst concerns, but we balance around however we choose to do it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/415232626031484928))<br />

Why are WW Monks the ONLY tank hybrid without access to their tank stance/presence/seal? With 0 Passive defenses + leather armor<br />
Sparring was supposed to help there, but I agree that it's a bit lackluster. Want them more like rogues in their tanking abilities. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417043621787885569))<br />
(As opposed to an Arms Warrior's, for example) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417043715228577792))<br />
Similar problem (but admittedly not as bad) with DPS DKs not getting their taunt ability.<br />
They get Death Grip. We don't want to give DPS DKs two Taunts, and I'm sure that most would prefer the utility of DGrip. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417188913774489600))<br />
<br />
Will we ever see fist weapons show up on monks while fighting? That or ability to x-mog into something that does show up.<br />
Intentional hard-coded kit is to only use weapons occasionally. Not sure what it'd take to change, even if class peeps wanted to! (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/416632694072565761))<br />
would like another attack to show weapons. Maybe a talent choice.<br />
Fist weapons specifically, we want to show more. We're working on that, but no promises when we'll get to do it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/416737807344746496))<br />
Would love a glyph to display weapons in all Monk attacks (Tiger Palm -&gt; Tiger Strike etc).<br />
I want a glyph that lets my hunter throw buzzsaws instead of nelf shuriken. Wait. Why didn't I do that?! (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/417011614756245505))<br />

Any chance on HPriest mastery being relooked at for WoD? Maybe turn all the overheals from it into something?<br />
Echo of Light us something we balance assuming it's going to be more overheal than average. More of regen than healing in design. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414224697778135040))<br />
It's not really a choice when it maths out to be 25% or less of the value of other secondaries in typical 25H.<br />
That only sounds accurate when significantly overhealing, and only if your goal is topping the healing meters. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414540027998117889))<br />
If you're not overhealing, and your goal is minimizing deaths, mastery can work well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414540234718576640))<br />
And when in the last 3 expacs has there not been significant overhealing most of the time even progression?<br />
I'm referring to using more healers than you need. Doing so results in RShams looking weak, and Discs strong. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414607390848188416))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
Hide gloves and shoulders, will it be available in WoD or maybe a cosmetic item to make them invisible?<br />
out of curiosity, why would you want to hide those specific items? (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/410513044003753984))<br />
<br />
Is there anyway we can get a &quot;hide weapon enchant&quot; option ever put into the game? They kinda destroy my xmog half the time <br />
It's been tossed around. We've floated the idea of enchant xmog too. But don't want to devalue the enchant either. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/412835346028564480))<br />
<br />
will there ever be a &quot;show shoulder&quot; button in the interface options like there is for cloak and helm? <br />
we've been talking a lot about this lately, would love to implement a more robust show/hide system for customization (Source (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/415205815880937472))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
You number-squished down to Wrath-ish levels; why not go to Classic or lower, more room for expansion?<br />
We are. 1-60 was linear, 60-90 exponential. We're extending that linear climb higher (still deciding where, likely to 85). (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/410889824296398848))<br />
<br />
Haste only feels good to classes that truly benefit from it though. Can it be +Amp instead? Anything else really.<br />
&quot;Classes that truly benefit from Haste&quot; means... Everyone except Warriors. (And we're going to fix that.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409046046480691200))<br />
<br />
Question: How is Haste going to interact with DoTs in Warlords if they're dynamic? Can't add bonus ticks on the fly, right?<br />
Duration doesn't change with haste; no new ticks. Time until next tick recalculated on each tick. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414226148361396226))<br />
Err, clarification: no new whole ticks needed to be added/removed. Partial ticks at the end are used to make it smooth. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/414226573303107586))<br />
<br />
... Also, semi-related Q: why does the caster haste buff give spell haste instead of casting speed (like the melee one does)?<br />
Related to both of these questions, we're planning to try to improve the simplicity of the various haste and haste-like effects. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/417386238799138816))<br />
<br />
because haste is only valuable up to a point and then falls behind. feels limiting when u waste so much haste after GCD cap<br />
Intended for stats to be close in value. Going to work on GCD capping issues in WoD. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409168227873193984))<br />
How much do you think removing reforging and increasing # of secondary stats will help w/GCD cap issues? More need to be done?<br />
It may help some; stats will be more spread out on average. Its impact is likely to vary significantly by spec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409910223923462144))<br />
Lowering it would have weird effects. The more buttons you press, the more internet latency hurts you.<br />
Yeah, we try not to go below 1sec GCDs in all but the most extreme circumstances. Hurts high latency players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/409897362442555392))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Providing more rewards for &quot;undesirable&quot; battlegrounds could work. Interesting idea. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/410986401472065536))<br />
<br />
Does PvP power boost my healing spells when I'm healing at world bosses? Does it count as outdoors healing?<br />
Where it works would follow the same rules as now (which is it would work in the outdoor world). (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/410471964403183616))<br />
<br />
I'm guessing most teams had 3 members and now lots of ppl play with more than 2 partners...This makes it alot easier to climb the ladders on multiple chars...<br />
# of players captures more people that played very few games in a way # of teams did not. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413084846152351744))<br />
The number of people that play a handful of games is quite high. Totally different problem though (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413084964775665664))<br />
So basicly it's a 'fake' enormous increase in participation, sort of. That fix should be fine.<br />
The participation number I quoted (+25%) is based on number of WoW accounts that have done arena. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413086969397137408))<br />
The # of gladiators increase is due to how things changed with teams. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413087727085572097))<br />
I know players use glad count as an indicator for participation, but 5.4 changed that metric. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413088066325082112))<br />
<br />
but don't titles require players to have more than 50 games won in that bracket?<br />
Yes receiving a title has that requirement. Being considered a &quot;participant&quot; doesn't. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413087637247778817))<br />
<br />
Instead of everyone counting towards the % towards titles how about people above 1000 rating count to that % only? Thoughts? =)<br />
It will be something along those lines. Will announce the rating after more analysis. 1000 is a good guess ;-) but no promise. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/417153059353927681))<br />
<br />
Any update to let us know if anything will change about arena title cut-offs?Or is % the same despite insanely low cut-offs?<br />
You can expect the number of Gladiators to be in the same ballpark as before taking into account 3v3 participation is up +25% (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413031186991034368))<br />
When you mean before, you surely mean last season before, not TBC before when PvP was enjoyed by more players than now.<br />
I remember people complaining in TBC. I remember people complaining in Wrath. I remember people complaining in Cata. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413085625546321920))<br />
We will use a minimum rating for a player to count against the pool when calculating titles. More info towards end of season. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413031522254716929))<br />
This is stupid. That could potentially decrease participation, why change something that has always been like that.<br />
It was based on # of arena teams not # of players. This is the first season with no teams. There is no precedent. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/413043851440295936))<br />

This time around 10 Death Knights were able to clear Heroic Throne of Thunder. It will be interesting to see how well they fare against current content when raids are cross realm in Warlords of Draenor! <br />

<br />
I'm worried over nothing, of course, and if there was a choice between buying Warlords with or without the boost, I'd buy it with, I just think things are becoming far too easy in this game and it's becoming more about the end goal rather than actually playing a game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You summed up exactly what I think is flawed in everyone having access to a purchasable character boost. If the option to a purchasable character boost is limited by say having a pre-existing level 80+, I do not mind as the player purchasing it already has the basic skills and experience in WoW in at least one of its incarnations. At least then, said person would've at least experienced the game a little to know how to move around, interact with NPCs/ players, access panels and stuff sufficiently to not be overwhelmed by the myriad of options at level 90 or--god forbid--become a hindrance to other players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But see, that misses the entire point of why Blizzard is implementing the character boost. The reason Blizzard is using it is specifically FOR new players; they don't want to stop new players from doing it. Blizzard believes that a new player of the game may be either intimidated by entering a game that has 100 levels to trek through (primarily where the majority of players will be playing 90-100) or where they may be joining up with friends who are level 90. Therefore, they're giving a new player a one-time use &quot;catch up with your friends so you can all play together&quot; button. <br />
<br />
I do totally agree that a player should level up, for their first time, properly .. especially to learn their class .. but I can also see Blizzard's rationale. That being said, Blizzard DID state that all players who choose the level 90 bump will have to go through an introductory area to learn their class a bit, just like Death Knights do upon creation. That'll help a bit.</div></div><hr />

We are. 1-60 was linear, 60-90 exponential. We're extending that linear climb higher (still deciding where, likely to 85)<br />
I think 85 is a good choice to end the linear curve and move to exponential for the rest. Think 80 would be a bit too low and 90 being way too high.</div></div><hr />

I've just changed realm with a new char not a realm transfer. The level 90 boost would of been nice to give an alt a bit of a head start. However if they want me pay extra for it I won't bother. If wow was f2p I wouldn't have a problem, but the game is funded by a sub, store, payed for services, merchandise etc Blizz are happy to attract new players and players who haven't played in a while i.e. Recruit a friend and scroll of resurrection. But when it comes to the active loyal players, not so much.<br />
<br />
My comment may smell of entitlement, but wouldn't it be nice for Blizz to say here's a free level 90 and not go woooah we could make a quick buck here.</div></div><hr />

Yes, you can buy WoW, boost and xfer the character, but it is not the same as seeing the boost as a shop item. Having such a thing in shop will open a slippery slope for other items, since people are getting used to seeing more and more stuff in it. No thanks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Psyhikes</div><div class="date">2014-01-02, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I realise that getting to level 90 is a grind, but putting the option to purchase a level 90 boost in the store, rather than having it as an exclusive, one-off perk with the expansion, might really take away from the game and getting to know our class. I won't lie, I would certainly use my free boost to 90 if I had one because I've levelled far too many times already for it to still be interesting on Horde AND Alliance, but I just think it's a bit much. There are already so many boosts to levelling that make it possible to get to 85 ridiculously fast already. Plus, what will stop new players (because there are new players) from doing it and thereby missing out on a hell of a lot of content?<br />
<br />
There is the old saying that if you don't like it, don't get it, so if it was for sale in the shop I certainly wouldn't buy it, but I'm concerned about the impact noobish level 90s will have on other players. There used to be a time when noobish behaviour was fading by the time a player reached max level (sadly, though, not in my own case), but with all the experience boosting stuff we have now, a lot of players are getting to max or high levels without learning much about the game or their class.<br />
<br />
I'm worried over nothing, of course, and if there was a choice between buying Warlords with or without the boost, I'd buy it with, I just think things are becoming far too easy in this game and it's becoming more about the end goal rather than actually playing a game.<br />
<br />
To be honest with you I could see both sides of the argument, I've got 9 90's (both Horde and Alliance) and have for every expansion leveled up at least 5 different characters to max on both factions so would consider myself a fairly experienced player with leveling. Other then say the rush to realm first &lt;class&gt; , leveling for the most becomes just a means to the end of getting another 90, therefore if it can be negated and taken away for say £10 then I would gladly do it. <br />
<br />
Yes spending the time leveling up and getting to grips with the class is important but anyone can do that at max level and learn just as fast, realistically if someone wants to get good at WoW they could just be given a brand new 90 which they never played, spend 1-2 hours reading up on class mechanics/watch youtube guides and then practice rotation to get a basic feel for the class. Wither further max level practice they would then easily become experienced and learn advanced techniques and become a better player as a whole. Think what people get hung up on is this old mentatlity of if you didn't earn the level 90 then you shouldn't have it/won't be good at it. Realistically this is quite a simple game with mechanics that any competant person can master quite quickly, if Blizzard really want to improve the general player base and make &quot;better&quot; players then realistically they need to make training resources to appeal to all learning styles of andragogy. <br />
<br />
Until then, WoWhead/Noxxic/MMO etc will continue to be resources that can easily take a novice to a beginner to an expert! Not to mention I bet you all learned something faster by talking to another player then trial and error learning yourself. (for some things anyway!)</div></div><hr />

What if at the usual price of 39.99$ you have the 90 boost and for 10$ less you don't ?<br />

<br />
However, for EXTRA 90's, I'd be fine with them being in the store, why? Because the main reason they might as well add it to the store, and why they are thinking about it in the first place, is because you can just buy more copies of WoD and transfer them to your main account, so they just want to create an easier/seemless way of doing this, it looks better to customers than having to fanny about with multiple services.<br />
<br />
It's going to have zero effect on me if some guy buys 20 lvl 90's, and it certainly isn't P2W, /drama everywhere.<br />
<br />
I'd possible buy one, but I'll most done before WoD and have the free boost.<br />
<br />
The worst they can do is increase the price of WoD to include the boost, that's too far imo, not after it's been announced and spoken about. &lt; Unless the more expensive version included a second character boost, but the first should be included in the price, it's touted as a feature of the expansion ffs and at least for me, was going to bring back three TBC players, but I doubt it if they pull that crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cosmetic stuff used to be included in the game with the sub price. They didn't charge extra for it. Other mmo's that are free to play and have cash shops also have cosmetic items but they allow you to grind out getting them in the game as an option. Which currently WoW does not allow you to do.</div></div><hr />

Let's hope it is just a survey testing the water. I think it's piss poor if it is implemented and would actually have a detrimental effect. They already announced it as an expansion feature. Adding an addendum that it's &quot;for additional charge&quot; just stinks of cowboy capitalism.<br />

No because there is way too many dense cunts that play wow that would make countless threads on how they was 'FORCED' to buy the expansion with the boost because everyone else was.( A bit like that stupid flying mount arguement...'i must feel the need to have flying mounts banned and continue to post countless threads about it even though im 'FORCED' to use one every time i log in)<br />
And continue to cry like little bitches if they didnt and feel cheated out of the game because according to them those that did buy it basically payed2win etc etc etc.....<br />

I swear to God, you people and your falling sky. It's quite literally market research. What company in the history of forever doesn't conduct market research? How the fuck else would they know how their customers feel about this kind of thing?<br />
<br />
Quick tip: if you get the survey, tell them you hate the idea of it! (Or you love it, if that's your choice).<br />
<br />
Personally, WoD should come with a free 90 no matter what. They showed it as a feature and now they need to deliver that. Could they offer a cheaper expansion for those that don't want the boost? Sure. But don't charge me £10 extra just for the boost &gt;_&lt; I'll happily pay what I normally do for an expansion as long as it includes the boost. Just knock the price down by £10 for those that don't want it.<br />
<br />
That said, I've done the level grind that much now that if I have to see another Kobold or have to kill another Twilight's Hammer member, I may just go crazy. Would I pay to get past all that though? No. But that's simply because I actually like to level (or at least did &gt;_&gt;). Would I want to take away an OPTIONAL purchase from people that are sick of the level grind? Not at all. And that's just it. It would be OPTIONAL. Just slap a restriction of having at least 1/2 level 100's already before you can get the boost or something. Not fucking rocket science.<br />
<br />
This won't even make players worse than thy already are. Blizzard have already stated that those that use their free boost will have to complete a DK starting area-like place to learn the basics of the class. A shit player will be shit no matter how they hit level cap. A good player will pick up how to play easily enough. The game has enough bad players already that this won't even affect the number of them. Hell, it might even get a few to learn something.<br />
<br />
There is nothing anywhere that says this is DEFINITELY happening! It is simply Blizzard asking it's customers what they want. I swear, a lot of you complain when they don't ask what players want. Now they actually are and all of a sudden what they're asking about is somehow coming to the game, without any doubts. Silly, silly people.</div></div><hr />

If the option to a purchasable character boost is limited by say having a pre-existing level 80+, I do not mind as the player purchasing it already has the basic skills and experience in WoW in at least one of its incarnations. At least then, said person would've at least experienced the game a little to know how to move around, interact with NPCs/ players, access panels and stuff sufficiently to not be overwhelmed by the myriad of options at level 90 or--god forbid--become a hindrance to other players.<br />
<br />
1. They'd be boosted to 90, not endgame. They'll still have to go through an intro, and then quest their way to 100.<br />
2. Most true noobs likely either won't boost, or will get overwhelmed quickly, unless they have a friend to help them learn.<br />
3. There's plenty of people who level traditionally and still suck.<br />
<br />
The idea of boost to 90 is primarily to get people to the new content, whether established player, returning player, or new player. I don't personally plan to use it, but I don't see a problem with is as quantity-restricted service.</div></div><hr />

If you put on your analytical mind there is just no way to condone the pricing comparatively. I also think that a lvl 90 boost for cash is something they should not do, but I am totally ok with a one-time boost for WoD as a perk for buying the expansion, in particular since they are changing all old models etc.<br />
<br />
Related to that; of course a more logical way to do that bit would be to offer a free recustomization once the character dings lvl 100 in case the looks were changed badly in your eyes, which would encourage players to still play and feel rewarded for it, spreading out logistical hurdles and happiness at the same time. But yes it is but a dream, one not very supported by their pricing strategies. :)</div></div><hr />

Cosmetic items don't affect gameplay. Paying for level 90's isn't cosmetic. It's actual gameplay. And it will affect low level dungeon and battleground queues and population. It will also affect end game when you have players running around that don't know their class. People already make jokes about the dreaded dk's in outland not having a clue what they're doing. I suggest you education yourself on the difference between cosmetic and gameplay before posting in a thread.</div></div><hr />

Paying for level 90's isn't cosmetic. It's actual gameplay. And it will affect low level dungeon and battleground queues and population. It will also affect end game when you have players running around that don't know their class. People already make jokes about the dreaded dk's in outland not having a clue what they're doing. I suggest you education yourself on the difference between cosmetic and gameplay before posting in a thread.<br />
I can assure you that I need no further education. Perhaps you'd like to attempt to insult me further though?<br />
<br />
Your problem is assuming every last person playing WoW will opt to pay for an instant 90. You'd be wrong. Not including the people that hate the idea, there will even be those that don't even know about it! Low level population will be no different to what you see today. Which is to say, not many.<br />
<br />
You're using incorrect logic when you say it'll result in people not knowing their class. Why is it incorrect? Because there are already countless people at level 90 that have gone from 1-90 the old fashioned way and still don't have a clue what they're doing. All Blizzard have to do is give those that use the boost a solo scenario or proving grounds area when they log in that will at least teach them the basics. They'll also still have another 10 levels to get through before they're done learning. No matter what, a bad player will be a bad player. A good one will have no problems learning how to play the class.<br />
<br />
Now I hope I managed to &quot;education&quot; you a little bit. But again, please feel free to attempt to insult me more...</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 $40 for a level 90 (assume 80 hours leveling 1 to 90, that is $0.5 per hour)<br />
The sad part is that this is a good price. If you can find a real job, work for a few hours. It saves 80 hours of grind.<br />
<br />
2 $50 for one raid gear. This is clearly pay to win because raid is gated.<br />
Even people want to waste time, they cannot get it via normal playing. They have to wait for next week.<br />
<br />
The first one is pay to win.<br />
Anyone who has a real job will choose to pay and avoid 80 hours of grind.<br />
<br />

<br />
I thought each account would get one free Level 90 character option, when you purchase WoD ? Not a stand alone separate price to buy a 90 level character. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is greedy.<br />
It wants to charge $10 extra for that option.<br />
<br />
If you want 2nd &quot;free&quot; 90, $40 dollars more.<br />
<br />
That is another way to say &quot;leveling 1 to 90 is no fun&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also 1-90 is no where near 80 hours of gameplay. More like 15-20 for people who've done it more than once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These sites charge more than $40. $100 to $200 is more likely.<br />
This is main reason that Blizzard thinks that giving a free 90 with WoD is too good. Let us charge them $10 more.<br />
<br />
It is really sad that people are doing something they don't enjoy to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how can this feature kill the game ?... HOW? explain it to us plox !<br />
<br />
U know why the people, that quit playing, actually quit? because they were bored... in Cata for example, there was NOTHING fun to do outside raids. <br />
But WoD makes many things right, it gives us more to do. U wont even know, if someone used the feature or lvlt the oldschool way... and 1month after release NO ONE will talk about this... NO ONE!<br />
<br />
And if u rly think this will kill WoW, than stop wastin' ur time and stop playin/dont come back.... rly... we dont need such whinie whinie players the /2 is allready whinie enough &lt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
and honestly... i think blizz is doing this cuz they want to prevent powerlvling sites, make it much cheaper than this sites and they will die and blizz has extra money... what difference does it make if blizz is doing this and not the powerlvler?</div></div><hr />

This just continues their theme since merging with Activision where they want to squeeze as much $ out of their player base as possible. <br />
<br />
Also, as others have said. They first mentioned it would be an available option to all who purchased the expansion and not having to pay extra for it. Again, they want more $$$$. Blizzard has changed as a company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could have sworn Blizzard did indeed say at Blizzcon, the boost was part of the expansion, not a separate additional cost ? I recall them saying, that with WoD purchase, comes a free Level 90 boost, meaning you can either create a brand new Level 1 guy, and can immediately boost to 90, or take a current lower level guy, lets say level 35, and boost to 90. You get this '90 Boost' just for one single character, once per account, and was part of the WoD expansion purchase. <br />
<br />
And I liked this idea, seemed fair for players that haven't played WoW since BC or Wrath. Or for me, who has several level 90's, and I would like to try a Warrior Tank, but just not interested in going through the Leveling process again, from 1 - 89.<br />
<br />
But now Blizzard is changing their stance, and this '90 Boost' will now be a paid service ? F, that, I'll pass.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xenogear3</div><div class="date">2014-01-02, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, Blizzard wants to give 1 free 90 to 1 account.<br />
The intention is to attract new players.<br />
<br />
Then, lots of current players are willing to buy more WoD for more level 90s.<br />
<br />
Blizzards says &quot;screw the new players, we can sell 90s directly for a huge profit.&quot;<br />
<br />
IMHO, you are a poor loser to actually level a 90 if $40 can buy one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be possible to do the following:<br />
- Buy WoW battle chest + expansions<br />
- Create new account<br />
- Boost to 90<br />
- Link accounts<br />
- Repeat for infinite level 90s<br />
<br />
So there's no keeping people from buying level 90s. They're just making it less convoluted.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Philosopino</div><div class="date">2014-01-02, 08:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">$39 no boost to 90.

<br />
Technically already could with the free boost with each copy of WoD by buying an extra copy for $40 and attaching it to your account.<br />
<br />
It's like people who bitch about the XP boost in the Asian store if it ever came to NA/EU and completely forget about RAF which already allows you to pay for an XP boost for upwards of 3 months, albeit for more hassle.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xtortion</div><div class="date">2014-01-02, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just to clarify a couple things, the free boost with the xpac is aimed at returning players (vanilla/bc/wotlk and a lesser extent cata). The mmo champ post about different pricing options is a survey, it's not implemented. People are confusing it as if it's 100% going live.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nirosu</div><div class="date">2014-01-02, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly the free boost should not cost extra and shouldnt be a separate thing. The battle chest can be fairly reliable gotten at 5 dollars then you have MoP at 10 current but normally 40 which with WoD it'll be like say 15. Then you have WoD which should be 40. That is roughly 60 dollars to get a WoW account a boost to 90 for that WoW account. So you link that account to your Bnet account and now you pay an extra 25 dollars to get the character on your main WoW account. That comes out to 85 dollars for a fresh lvl 90 character. Honestly that is fine. If blizzard wants to put on the store a buy a lvl 90 character for say 70 dollars I think that is alright, but don't inflate the price of an expansion for no reason when we are getting baseline less aka no new race or class.</div></div><hr />

admittedly, levelling can be boring if you have a max level character. but still, you should have to go through it like everyone else. last thing we need is a bunch of new 90s who dont know how to play at all.<br />
<br />
remember DK tanks in outland? or timeless isle geared people in siege? convenience has its consequences on the rest of the game.</div></div><hr />
