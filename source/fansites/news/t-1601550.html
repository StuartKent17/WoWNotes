They said it was because it would've been too easy to get gold each week from it.<br />

Shaman is showing mid pack as of 29th. Wait till sims are ran for the most recent changes. Hopefully we're all more in line, although why on earth they're buffing warriors again is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

I just hope there's a significant numbers pass pending, for all DPS. Not sure if my opinion is shared, but Elemental feels so wonky and weird now, and does shit dps. Unless I'm just doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />

Like it's hard to nerf gold gain. Another bad excuse to delete more content IMO. They nerfed gold value of Dire Maul north loot because of bots without deleting whole instance in TBC and now the only option is to remove that place?</div></div><hr />

Don't expect a single reply from them. No matter how many times I try, they just ignore it. Be it constructive feedback or not.

Hello, Demonbolt is actually needing a nerf and now they buffed it more? Now I'm fearing they will have a knee-jerk reaction due to massive QQ's and then they'll nerf bat it until it's dead and useless. Ugh, I just want them to at least divide its damage, have a chunk of it be a dot like what they did with GoSac: Chaos Bolt. I just can't deal with the complaints and have them nerf it mindlessly.<br />
<br />
But I'm glad they buffed HoG and Soul Fire, they really need it.<br />
<br />
And still ignoring Destruction. Having an AoE niche and sacrificing its single-target dps is just stupid and bad design. Why in the hell are they ignoring this spec when it has a MISERABLE single-target dps?</div></div><hr />

this is the problem with Rshaman trought past 2 exp. you have to do twice as much or even more to just be on part to the other healer. and you get out of raid spot just because your class is &quot;BAD&quot; compared to other. no reason to have a Rshaman in the raid anymore.</div></div><hr />

so they remove the scenario instead nerf the gold drops in there cause f*** the logic - they remove 3/4 of content they have put in MoP - makes me wonder hwy the hell they were wasting time on it in first place on developing it.<br />
<br />
Also to warrior buff - pure lol - its like syaing to all melee just drop your class and reroll warrior cause clearly warrior will be MoP's locks of WoD -_-</div></div><hr />

Kind of surprised about this as well.. Fury needed some attention... but Arms? Aside from the mobility complaints in PvP, the damage output was quite solid. Healing on hybrids needs to come down still. <br />

This happens for most classes / specs in one way or another other mate - your class / spec is not being singled out in any way. <br />
<br />
I am seriously umming and arring between what to main next xpac (and no not for fotm before someone buts in) but reading most of the WOD alpha/beta feedback/discssion threads, this is replicated in most (not all) but most classes / specs discussions. <br />
<br />
Resto druids are in a nice place now on beta but smart money says they will disappear as shaman grow. Neither will be happy at some point but is pretty standard. It would be nice if they could balance classes evenly and they try but every patch brings winners and losers.</div></div><hr />

It's not actually my main class or spec, 'merely' that of one of my alts. <br />

It would be nice if they could balance classes evenly and they try but every patch brings winners and losers.I think Priests are a safe bet as a healer - if holy fades away Disc will probably be made stronger, or Holy buffed. For DPS Warlocks and Mages have been a safe choice almost always, however much they complain.</div></div><hr />

It does sound about right...<br />
<br />
Warlocks were OVER nerfed because of how strong we are on Live right now. Now that they got our numbers down they are slowly bringing them back up to where they should be (in line with other DPS specs).<br />
<br />
Just wish they would give Destro Health-Funnel back, though, since the only way to heal a pet as Destro uses up a Burning Ember one you get the perk beyond level 90 (it heals worth squat, btw)...which is a HUGE dps loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a patchwork sim, though. Given that there are no mechanics, or movement, or anything, its not surprising to see melee at the top. Show me a real raid sim and I'll be more inclined to agree with you.<br />
<br />
That said, they DO need to stop buffing Warriors. The problem with that class isn't is damage, it's that the mechanics are not fun.</div></div><hr />

Don't get too excited. Read the tool tips description. It says it takes 24 hours to recover 1 use. I interpret that as 1 charge per 24 hours will become available. Meaning you still can only do it once per day after the initial 3 uses. I'm guessing its for people who can't log on every day and miss their daily cooldown usage.</div></div><hr />

Looks like they want all specs to be nearer equal footing in regards to PvP.<br />

Yup, looks like I'll be rerolling this expansion.<br />
I love my rogue but they've gotten the least attention this expansion and will almost definitely start out extremely weak again.</div></div><hr />

Initially, I was wondering why Blizzard would make such a change to the profession daily CD system. But what you said does make sense. Might have an interesting effect on what's available on the AH (assuming Blizzard hasn't made everything BoP).</div></div><hr />

If you look, almost every class was nerfed other than the ones that the over-nerfed.</div></div><hr />

It's one thing to, say, farm MC for transmog or pets, but if you feel you HAVE to do Troves each week as part of gold farming, which includes time spent farming keys...<br />
<br />
... and now that I think about it, taking it out closes an option for actual gold farmers.</div></div><hr />

It's hardly bias. <br />

It's easier to push out build after build, while tuning numbers on Beta for a whole new xpac than right in the middle of content. Everyone expected to see Balance and Feral nerfs, not only was their damage higher than many others but so was their hybrid heals.</div></div><hr />

I don't have beta so I don't know how ww is doing for dps, but wow. I hope they were doing really well or something because every single ability got a nerf.<br />
Would love to know if anybody is testing out monk dps.<br />
<br />
I was in ashran as a hunter, trying it out seeing if i'd like to try and level one, and i did enjoy it. so i saw a monk, tried to kill him, i had every buff from ashran, and i could not keep him off me. i used every trap, CD, deterrence, everything i could think of. and when i got away he was right back on me. took a good 5 minutes for him to kill me but if i didn't have every buff on the island i would have died instantly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am seriously umming and arring between what to main next xpac (and no not for fotm before someone buts in) but reading most of the WOD alpha/beta feedback/discssion threads, this is replicated in most (not all) but most classes / specs discussions. <br />
<br />
Resto druids are in a nice place now on beta but smart money says they will disappear as shaman grow. Neither will be happy at some point but is pretty standard. It would be nice if they could balance classes evenly and they try but every patch brings winners and losers.<br />
<br />
Hardly as much as shamans though.<br />
<br />
Shamans have ALWAYS (TBC / WotLK / Cata / MoP) started out as the worst (or extremely sub par at least), and then require several buff patches to get in a position where they can be competitive again.<br />
Yes Resto shamans are doing fine in SoO, but the other healing classes (other than holy priests) come along just as fine; and most of them did pretty damn fine on T14/T15 as well.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna stick with resto shaman as ultimately it's the thing I like the most. But I'm really dreading how the start of WoD is going to work out with the extreme amount of (indirect) nerfs shamans have gotten. <br />
I'm ok with the concept of nerfing smart heals and AoE healing; but that has been 90% of a resto shaman's repertoire in SoO. And so far I've seen little compensation.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the DPS specs btw. And I'm kinda hoping that blizzard after 5 friggin' expansions started to learn from their past mistakes. <br />
I mean the lightning bolt nerf (no longer castable while moving) is a great example. I fully understand and agree with the reason for it to change. However the compensation for shaman throughput whilst moving is utterly retarded. It's bandaid fix upon bandaid fix, which is totally UNACCEPTABLE for an expansion as that is THE moment to tackle stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can see the difference in the spell description. I'm also concerned with this. Not enough people actually talk about monks in general. And even when a blue commented on the nerfs to rogues and feral being OP, they had nothing to say about monks.<br />
<br />

<br />
How much stronger do the Ashran buffs make you? I'm not in the beta so I have no idea what that entails. Sounds like it was mostly the ability of them to stay on you because of movement. Could you tell how much damage they were doing compared to what you could do in the same situation? (I assume since you said you'd die instantly without the buffs that he had high damage) Did he also have the ashran buffs on though?</div></div><hr />
