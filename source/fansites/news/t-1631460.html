Warlords of Draenor is live in the US and EU! A hotfix for quest objective bottlenecks is in the works (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/532723636164395008).<br />

<br />
Warlords Launch - Additional Khadgars<br />
Khadgar has cast Mirror Image and some of you have probably already noticed a few additional versions of his NPC around Azeroth. He's there to help you get to Draenor once the expansion goes live!<br />
<br />
We've had some time to evaluate the overwhelmingly positive response to Warlords of Draenor as it went live for European players, and realized getting you through the Dark Portal in an efficient manner is important. When the switch from Mists of Pandaria to Warlords takes place at 12:00 a.m. PST, you will automatically receive a quest titled &quot;The Dark Portal&quot; that will direct you to visit Khadgar in the Blasted Lands. However, now that we have four more Khadgars added to the world, you can go to one them as well!<br />
<br />
Here are Khadgar's locations:<br />
<br />
<br />
Stormwind - next to the Hero's Call Board in the Trade District Orgrimmar - next to the Warchief's Command Board in the Valley of Strength Shrine of Seven Stars (Alliance) - in front of the main entrance Shrine of Two Moons (Horde) - in front of the main entrance<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: if you happen to not receive the initial quest that leads you to Draenor, have no fear! Just find your closest Khadgar and he'll lead the way.<br />
<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Large Garrison Buildings<br />
Garrisons have five large buildings, with two large plots in a Level 3 Garrison. The Barracks, Bunker / War Mill, and Stables are the three most useful buildings while leveling. You build Barracks by default while leveling, so you can keep it if you want.<br />
<br />
<br />
Barracks (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/28-barracks) (Icy Veins Guide (http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/garrison-barracks-guide)) - Gives you a bodyguard in Draenor from Level 2 and faster follower leveling from Level 1. <br />

Stables (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/buildings/67-stables) (Icy Veins Guide (http://www.icy-veins.com/wow/garrison-stables-guide)) - Stay mounted while interacting with objects, don't get dazed, and 20% more movement speed at Level 3. You won't get to Level 3 while leveling. <br />

This is likely the least useful building for most players.<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Legendary Quest Line<br />
Warlords of Draenor has an expansion long legendary quest line, similar to Mists of Pandaria. You can start at level 98 with Call of the Archmage (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/35988-call-of-the-archmage) by speaking to Khadgar's Servant (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/83858-khadgars-servant) in your garrison. He will send you to Archmage Khadgar (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/83823-archmage-khadgar) in Talador. <br />
<br />
Khadgar will send you to Skyreach (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/36157-spires-of-the-betrayer) to collect an item from the last boss. This quest can be done on Normal or Heroic difficulty. After obtaining the item, you head back to Khadgar and he gives you another quest: Khadgar's Task (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/35989-khadgars-task). This quest will reward you with an epic item level 640 ring:<br />

<br />
Khadgar then sends you on three quests to Heroic Bloodmaul Slag Mines (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/35990-core-of-flame), Grimrail Depot (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/35991-core-of-iron), and The Everbloom (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/35992-core-of-life). After completing those dungeons, it is time for Tackling Teron'gor (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/35993-tackling-terongor) and collecting exactly 4,986 (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/36158-draenors-secret-power) Apexis Crystal (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/823-apexis-crystal).<br />
<br />
You then return to Khadgar (Eyes of the Archmage (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/35994-eyes-of-the-archmage)) and follow him to Nagrand (Fugitive Dragon (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/36000-fugitive-dragon)). There you meet up with Chromie and follow some clues (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/36206-the-dragons-tale) to find Kairozdormu's body. After defeating his spirit (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/35995-tarnished-bronze), Khadgar will upgrade your ring (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/36004-power-unleashed) to item level 680. The next part of the quest line takes place in Highmaul.<br />

<br />

Warlords Launch Mini-FAQ<br />
I've seen a handful of questions with regards to what happens when Warlords of Draenor launches, so here's a brief FAQ that should hopefully clear up questions.<br />
<br />
When will the launch of the game happen for my time zone/region?<br />
Warlords of Draenor will launch in:<br />
<br />
<br />
Europe at 12:00 a.m. CET on Thursday, November 13 North America (US) at 12:00 a.m. PST (1:00 a.m. Mountain, 2:00 a.m. CST, 3:00 a.m. EST) on Thursday, November 13 Oceanic will launch at the same time as the US. <br />
Korea at 12:00 a.m. KST on Tuesday, November 18 Taiwan at 12:00 a.m. CST on Tuesday, November 18 China at 12:00 a.m. CST on Tuesday, November 18<br />
<br />
<br />
How do I get to Draenor?<br />
When the clock hits midnight (or whatever respective time zone you're in), you'll see the following things happen:<br />
<br />
A server message (yellow text in your chat window) will be displayed, signaling the launch of Warlords of Draenor! If you've already upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor, a quest will popup in your quest log, directing you to the Blasted Lands. You do not need to be in a major city to receive this quest. If you haven't upgraded your account, you won't be able to receive the quest or venture in Draenor until you do. Once you get to Blasted Lands, speak to Khadgar outside the Dark Portal to head to Draenor! Note: you don't need to be online at midnight to get the quest, it'll be waiting for you whenever you do decide to login. <br />
<br />
<br />
Do I need to install Warlords of Draenor or use the install disc?<br />
If you're already playing on retail realms, you have all the files you need to play Warlords of Draenor - no further downloads or installs are required. If you haven't updated your WoW client to version 6.0.3 yet, you can either just run the Battle.net app to do so, or install the game using the Game Disc DVD (if you bought a Box Copy of Warlords of Draenor).<br />
<br />
Do i need to logout at midnight before I start leveling?<br />
Nope! If you've already upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor, you won't need to do anything! You can always double check your account status by logging into the Account Management page at https://us.battle.net/account/management/<br />
<br />
What happens if I boost a character to level 90 after Warlords of Draenor launches?<br />
If you haven't upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor yet, your boosted character will be placed in Blasted Lands. If you've upgraded your account to Warlords of Draenor, boosted characters are placed directly in Tanaan Jungle. <br />
<br />
<br />
Will I be able to invite a friend to my realm and quest together, vise versa? didn't see anything pertaining to this answered, would be nice to know.<br />
Yup! You'll be grouped together on the same realm.<br />
<br />
What happens if someone boosted a character, he's in Blasted Lands with the Iron Invasion quest chain but he can't login to play again till after WOD goes live?<br />
The quest chain actually doesn't disappear when WoD launches. The Feat of Strength (and associated title) is no longer awarded, but you can still do the quests, gaining the quest rewards (gear) and the pet, Iron Starlette. So your friend would be able to continue the quest chain in Blasted Lands and unlock the rest of his abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No idea how strong Nova is at level 100 because I didn't play beta but this one button spam all night long in SoO was sooo boring. I just hope it doesn't just switch to PW:S spam with the buff to it.</div></div><hr />

Things have not calmed down. They have, in fact, calmed up. (read that in Teal'c voice)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that will happen. Discipline is mechanically broken. Speaking of broken, the EU servers also fall into that category. This is perhaps the worst launch of any game I have played.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you shouldn't play on a High pop. server? I have zero problems on my nice and snug Medium server.</div></div><hr />

dodnt know what the source is for this info its not only incorrect its become even worse then the last 17 hours.<br />
garrisons dodnt work, if you try to enter or use them it will lagg you out. quest/rares are almost impossible to use. flighpoints get you stuck. mounting doesnt work half the time. yes its better with less dc's.....atleast until you see 45 of 90 guildies loose conection at the same time. and at launch low pop realms/dead realms where very playble. but even those are broken down half the time now.</div></div><hr />

Good point, I should just leave my guild and all my friends behind because Blizzard can't, still after 10 years of running the game, figure out that the fancy new expansion is going to be unplayable and their incompetence at predicting how the game is actually played is going to give everyone a completely garbage experience.</div></div><hr />

Never in my life have I tried to play something as shit as WoD at launch. Like I played back when Cataclysm launched and the game was bigger than ever and once I got in after 20 min login troubles at midnight it kinda worked and was maybe the most fun I've had in WoW. This time it didn't stop lagging like hell until like 5-6 hours past midnight. Not only that, but what kind of retard designed a starting zone where a million people have to mark 6 trees but they can't do it at the same time?</div></div><hr />
