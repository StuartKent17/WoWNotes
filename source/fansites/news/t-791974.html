Cataclysm Preview: Tol Barad<br />
An island off the coast of the Eastern Kingdoms, Tol Barad is a historic land now sought-after by the leaders of the Horde and the Alliance. Its strategic, isolated location makes it an ideal stronghold from which to conduct military strikes. In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, a battle will be waged to seize control of this prized territory. Should you triumph, unique rewards await you. Read more about this all-new world PvP and questing zone here.<br />
<br />
The Fight for Tol Barad<br />
Similar to Wintergrasp, Tol Barad will serve as an open world PvP zone, although there is also a hub on Tol Barad Peninsula for both factions to complete daily quests. Reachable by portals in Stormwind and Orgrimmar, or via a level-85 mage teleport or portal, Tol Barad will accept up to 80 players per faction to engage in brutal combat across the island's surface. Unlike Wintergrasp, Tol Barad will not have Tenacity buffs. Instead, the queue system will attempt to match each side at a 1-to-1 ratio. Battles will take place every two hours and thirty minutes, giving the offensive faction a chance to claim territory.<br />
<br />
Tol Barad will feature capture-point gameplay. There are three keeps and three towers for the defending side to hold. When destroyed by the attackers, each tower will add five minutes to the standard fifteen-minute battle timer. In order to win, though, all three keeps must be captured and controlled by the attackers. If these keeps cannot be taken by the attacking forces, the defending faction will claim victory in Tol Barad. Similar to Eye of the Storm, Tol Barad determines whether a keep has been captured by the number of players from each side in the immediate area. There is, however, a new twist: each time a member of your faction is killed in the immediate vicinity of a keep, a slider bar will move slightly in favor of the opposing faction. So not only does the size of each force in the area determine who controls each keep, but losing allies during the contesting process determines control as well.<br />
<br />
In order to destroy the defenders' towers, attackers will have access to an all-new type of war machine: Abandoned Siege Engines. Six of these Siege Engines will be placed around the map, and these vehicles can be used to bombard the towers. In contrast to the Siege Engines of Wintergrasp, these machines cannot attack players or buildings while the vehicles are being driven. Instead, players must drive them within range of a tower and jump out, allowing the vehicle to transform into an automated cannon that can lay siege to the tower. The Abandoned Siege Engine will continue to damage the closest tower in range until the machine is destroyed by opposing forces.<br />
<br />
To the Victor Go the Spoils<br />
Players who win the battle for Tol Barad will be awarded honor points in addition to Tol Barad commendations. These commendations can be used along with new reputations as currency with special vendors who sell rare and epic items, mounts, and more. In addition, the controlling faction will have unique access to extra daily quests. Similar to the Vault of Archavon, Tol Barad gives those who control it the chance to form a raid and best foul beasts locked within Baradin Hold for precious rewards.<br />
<br />
Questing for a Living<br />
Aside from the battle to control Tol Barad, there are many quests available to both factions just off of the main island on Tol Barad Peninsula. Members of the Horde will assist Hellscream's Reach, an all-new faction vying for control of Tol Barad. At odds with the Horde are Baradin's Wardens, an Alliance faction also seeking to command the territory. Six unique quests, randomly determined from a larger pool of missions, will be offered daily. This will allow for diversity in completing quest objectives as you explore Tol Barad Peninsula over time. The faction that controls Tol Barad will also have sole access to six additional daily quests. Completing each of these exclusive quests will award experience, gold, and Tol Barad commendations. By accomplishing these tasks, players will learn of the perilous inmates held within the prison on Tol Barad, as well as why this isolated land is of great importance to Hellscream's Reach and Baradin's Wardens. In addition, increasing reputation with these new factions will grant access to incredible rewards.<br />
<br />
With so much at stake in the wake of the Cataclysm, Tol Barad will be fiercely sought-after by the Horde and the Alliance, but it's up to you to help determine which side makes this island the next great military port of the Eastern Kingdoms.<br />

World of Warcraft’s 6th Anniversary!<br />
World of Warcraft turns six on November 23rd, 2010! It’s been a truly incredible six years, and we’d like to thank you all for joining us on this momentous occasion. To celebrate, players that log into the game between the dates of November 30th and December 14th will receive a feat of strength added to their Achievements. We look forward to another great year ahead and many more to come!<br />

Official forums going read-only<br />
We're still hammering out some last minute issues, so the new forums aren't quite ready for prime time use just yet. We're working day to day to see when we can transition to the new site, so putting these forums as read-only could happen any time between tomorrow and early next week.<br />
<br />
Consider it a standing warning that these forums will go read-only soon™. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/132047/forums-going-read-only-update))<br />
<br />
Class changes and Blue Posts on official forums<br />
We don't want the expectation to be that the reason you come to the forums is to get a blue post.<br />
<br />
I tend to confine my posting to the three role forums. I read the PvP one, professions, dungeons and raids, UI, achievements, bug reports and a few others every day or two, and even if I don't regularly read a forum, rest assured that many folks at Blizzard do. Consider for example that I don't read forums posted in languages other than English (you'd think with the number of years I spent in school that I could have picked up something as practical as a second language), yet somehow that feedback still gets back to us. :)<br />
<br />
While forum communication has advantages, such as quick turn around and the ability to have a fairly intimate conversation with developers, it has disadvantages too. We often lose the context of a conversation when folks read only the blue response, then jump in to a thread without reading it all. Many times the blue post detracts from an excellent conversation already taking place. Blue posts are famous for derailing conversations. Smart players in parts of Europe, Asia or Latin America get to participate in the conversations only indirectly. It drives me nuts that players sometimes assume only the threads (or forums!) with blue responses are the ones that get read. Finally, I think knowing that there is a small chance that a forum will get a dev response spurs some players into saying ridiculous things in the hopes of &quot;winning the lottery.&quot;<br />
<br />
We think these forums work best when they are 99% defined by players communicating with other players. With the new community site going live, it gives us an opportunity to try some things differently. I still plan on communicating with players as much as I can -- it is very important to me personally and I think it's a critical part of my job to get feedback on World of Warcraft's design. However, we're going to try some different avenues for communication in addition or perhaps in place of frequent developer forum posts.<br />
<br />
We'll see how it works out. Blizzard is nothing if not iterative on design, so if we're not happy with the results, we promise to try different things. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/132445/giving-pvp-forum-the-blue-response-it-deservs))<br />

The shattering is the world shattering, ie, changing, which also releases deathwing to start setting fire to everything. So the world changes for good on Tuesday if all goes to plan.<br />

That sucks. So the 4th and 5th anniversaries were 'important milestones' but the 6th isn't? If the only pet had been for the 5th anniversary I'd understand, but the 4th doesn't strike me as any more important than the 6th...</div></div><hr />

<br />
A nice thing about farming ZG for rep is the trash keeps respawning on 30 minute soft reset even after you kill the bosses.<br />
<br />
I am in a similar boat as you, I am 14k/21k towards exalted. I did a trash run last night and got about 4k rep from one run due to bijous and all the coins. In other words, if you want exalted with Zandalar Tribe you can still do it, you just have to do a trash clear several times before Tuesday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frost DKs dmg is over the top, especially in ae situations. In 4.0.1 i did 5.2k+ dps at he boss dummy (without any other targets nearby) with my Frost DK with a average ilvl of 218. <br />
And in AE situations its far higher. Need to wait until the 4.0.3 patching finished to test if they already changed it.<br />
<br />
If not, they need to do something like with Holy Wrath where the dmg is divided between all targets. So single target it wont be too weak and in ae situations it wont be so op.</div></div><hr />

Now say for example you added 20% base haste to greater heal might have made it viable but i think us priests and ill speak for us all here will still not be using greater heal because of a 20% base increase ill stick to the sheilds pennance renews and a few flashes :)<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I seriously doubt you're speaking for all priests, maybe all the priests who have never experienced any other kind of raiding than what existed during Wotlk. <br />
Greater heals can always be hasted and pre-casted, and the good priests who actually care about mana and spike healing will be casting a pre-casted greater heal instead of 2 flash heals after the target has taken damage.</div></div><hr />

I sadly never got a beta invite and haven't bothered with the PTR. Of the tons (and tons!) of screenies that have been posted I've looked at maybe 10% of them as I didn't want to spoil too much (even though I know looking at screenshot and actually seeing it yourself are two different things).

They aren't nerfing it since Howling Blast doesn't have some uber scale rate like other abilities.

I obviously cannot speak for everyone who did not have access to beta, but I for one was hesitant to read these forums because of the heavy use of beta information. Since I didn't get in, I wanted to be surprised by the Shattering and everything that went with it. That meant not really being able to look up specific beta information including rep information (although I wasn't attempting any of the achieves so it wasn't as important to me). A lot of other people don't even check this site every day like I do. It's definitely easy with so much changing to get mixed information and not be certain which is correct, but thank you for clarifying.</div></div><hr />

That I can understand, it's the misinformation started by griefers and lack of reading skills that seem to plague these forums that I can't understand. At this point the reputation grinds do not matter, because unless you're close to exalted with the faction already, it will be near impossible to reach exalted with Zandalar or Shen'dralar within one week.</div></div><hr />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/132742/world-of-warcraftrsquos-6th-anniversary<br />
<br />
I have read the post that you linked from beginning to end twice. *Nowhere* in that post does it state that there *won't* be a pet for the 6th anniversary. You can certainly interpret it to mean that since he talks about reserving them &quot;most likely&quot; (&lt;-- how vague is that) for the most notable milestones or events in the future, but you have to decide what makes a milestone notable/important for Blizzard. As usual the blue post left them all of the wiggle room in the world to either release a pet or not. They haven't committed themselves to anything either way.<br />
<br />
I personally seriously, seriously doubt that the reward you'll get (the Feat of Strength that they mention) will simply be a &lt;bong&gt; &quot;You've achieved: Logging in for the 6th anniversary&quot;... and nothing else. I predict there will be a &quot;Check your mail for a thank you gift&quot; just like they've been doing in recent years. With the talent level at Blizzard they can pop out NC pets without too much effort I'm sure. It's not like they have to put all of the detail into them that they do for the ones you buy in the Blizzard Store. Many of the pets are just shrunken or recolored models that already exist in the game anyway.</div></div><hr />

The 4.0.3a old world shattering changes will affect all players, whether or not they have bought the Cataclysm expansion. This way, if someone just bought vanilla WoW then they can still level up to 60 before buying TBC and so forth. We will all live in the same world.</div></div><hr />

Also, the announcement of the 6th Anniversary Feat of Strength says something about players who log in between November 30th and December 14th will get it... wouldn't that suggest that the patch that introduces the Feat will be on November 30th? If it's next week, I'd think you'd get the feat for logging in on November 23rd, which is the actual anniversary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh it'll get nerfed eventually. Right now on live at 80 I am seeing 40k+dps on trash packs of which 80-90% of the damage is Howling Blast. There are two main problems, first it is almost entirely passive AoE, you just do your single target rotation and if there are adds you get free extra damage, this is pretty faceroll from a gameplay perspective, next it just scales ridiculously well with adds. Third, frost mastery is balanced around only increasing part of your dps rotation, by which I mean it is balanced around the assumption that frost damage only makes up a certain proportion of your DPS, once you switch to an AoE situation frost is pretty much all your DPS which means the mastery scaling is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Unholy's mastery has the same problem but they other way round, they seem to have balanced it around the AoE numbers which makes it a total waste of a stat for single target. The overall single target DPS for both specs has been fine which I suspect is the reason DKs have been getting almost no attention for the last few months. They seem reluctant to make any sort of meaningful change this close to launch but I fully expect to see them revisited at some point, whether that will be 4.1, 4.2 or not for another year who knows.<br />
<br />
Right now Frost DKs are still relatively rare and most guilds have stopped raiding so the ridiculous AoE potential isn't widely known. Once it becomes better known it will get nerfed pretty fast I expect.</div></div><hr />

Argent Dawn rep? Just run Strat a several times. Depending on the class of course it's fast to clear. With my DK I can do a baron run in 10 minutes. A full clear will give more rep though. You still have time if you start now. :D</div></div><hr />

Shen'dralar okay, but Zandalar is one of the fastest reps to grind. You can definitely still get that done even starting from nothing.</div></div><hr />

Maybe next week will apply the patch and &quot;begin&quot; the shattering? If someone could clarify this, it would be great. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Note he says, &quot;We plan to reserve...&quot; From the word &quot;plan&quot; it sounds like it is their philosophy going forward. So from here on out, pets will probably be reserved for important milestones. <br />
<br />
<br />
I have read the post that you linked from beginning to end twice. *Nowhere* in that post does it state that there *won't*...<br />
<br />
I think it is pretty obvious from the Blue thread. You can bet that Blizzard knows (and has committed to) exactly what will happen for the 6 year anniversary. Regardless of talent level, pets take a bit of work and planning, especially if they add new animations and such. Deathy is a perfect example... and his associated bugs.<br />
<br />

They are going to give everyone a free pet down the road in Cata at least that's what was mentioned in the blue post. (Apparently there is a more important event then the 6th anniv). It is a shame that we get no pet, but if we get it eventually then it won't really matter I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True if you do it correctly. However most people only run full clears with a group in order to gain rep, and with you only getting ~5k rep (4.5k for the clear, 500-1000 rep for the shared coins and bijous) in only 2 resets, you're going to be SoL. For those who really want to push it for the feat of strength, they can always just solo farm the trash, collect the bijous and coins, go turn those in, and wait for the soft reset in a few hours. It it possible to get from neutral to exalted in 6 days if you do it that way.<br />
<br />
Or you could do it the way I did, farm Shen'dralar rep, save the arcanums that you get as quest rewards, and only go into ZG once, clearing it out to reach friendly, then turning in all the arcanums for exalted. I would not recommend this, I only did it this way b/c I was completing Insane in the Membrane and kept the arcanums out of convenience.</div></div><hr />

Well, that's different information than you posted initially. Based on Blizzard's history of giving vague answers that leave the community to &quot;guess&quot; at what they meant it seemed reasonable that there could still be chances for a pet. To me... if it really isn't a major milestone to them then just make a post on their stupid website and be done with it. Who gives a shit about a Feat of Strength? &quot;Oh boy... I logged into the game six years after it was born... nothing can stop me now!&quot; Maybe next we can get achievements for logging in on Ghostcrawler's birthday and playing during the opening ceremony of the next Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

Of course not. They also still have the earthquakes going even though Deathwing has obviously already escaped and done his damage. The events of the Shattering also advance the timeline in game another 5 years (see Anduin Wrynn) so it really wouldn't make much sense for the elements to still be invading :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the patch would be only a week before the expansion not two...<br />
<br />
Plus I doubt they'd do it so close to Thanksgiving...<br />
<br />
If it's not next week, IMO, it will be kinda dumb of them. With the changes to the 1-60 experience a lot of people are going to be rolling alts and trying out new class combinations etc. By releasing it two weeks before Cata hits it means that the beginner zones will be relatively clear of traffic to make way for all the brand new accounts that will inevitably be opened by newbies seeing what all the fuss is about. It also gives people a fairly reasonable chance to get an alt up to 80 (if they're a fast leveller) for people that want to switch mains for Cata.<br />

I'd guess that maybe that isn't a bug - but something that happens up to December 7th and stops with the release of Cata.<br />

<br />
*sigh* Or MAYBE....you know, just MAYBE they were too busy getting the bugs ironed out of Cataclysm which is released in 2 frickin' weeks and ensuring that everything has been ready for what is probably the most extensive graphical overhaul of WoW (which is shortly following the release of the most significant systems overhaul the game has every seem) since it was released has meant they didn't have time this year or they forgot or were just plain too tired. Why is it that every time Blizzard does anything there's always someone ready to blame it on a nefarious scheme or personality defect in the people in charge.<br />
<br />
When you are getting ready for an expansion as major as Cataclysm - which has involved the construction of some major zones and instances with totally new mobs, gear and NPCs as well as an overhaul of all the quest rewards from 1-60, plus all the new Tier gear and a complete overhaul of the geography of the majority of zones in the game then the modellers may have to prioritise. I'd imagine that &quot;Design a pet to give people for a completely insignificant anniversary&quot; was pretty low on that list.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gulbrandt</div><div class="date">2010-11-18, 09:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm amused by the anniversary/pet thing. I wonder how many people would even notice it was WoW's 6th anniversary if it wasn't announced? And I suppose people have been completely oblivious that not only is Blizzard developing a new expansion, but completely re-doing the old world. :p Do you want your expansion on time, or do you want a pet? Sure, they can do a pet, but when people accuse Blizzard of being &quot;lazy&quot;and not fixing the 80,000,000 insignificant details that are apparently super important to people, they apparently don't realize this would delay Cataclysm for months. Those little projects add up. I suspect Blizzard is aware of shortcomings, I'm sure. I'm also sure they're focused on things that have the biggest impact on what makes the game playable and fun. They're trying to focus on the big picture. I haven' been disappointed yet. :)<br />
<br />
I'd also like to point out that each Realm is probably run across multiple high-end servers, all of which eat up a LOT of bandwidth. I imagine Blizz has done some high-end negotiating with their ISP for a lot of quality bandwidth and great up-time. Servers also regularly have failed hardware (hard drives, any other component) I'm sure they also have a truly epic backup and recovery system. (Can you imagine if they lost anyone's characters because of hardware failure? Yeah, not so good for business.). All of this ends up costing Blizzard a huge amount of money every month. They still make a decent profit, obviously, or they wouldn't be doing this. :P But still--they don't have an unlimited team of developers. They have a limited amount of time with limited developers, so they have to narrow down which projects are most important. I'm sure that decision is not always easy. Certain things sometimes get left behind, but I'm sure it's due to lack of time, not lack of interest or effort.<br />
<br />
So really, who cares about the pet? That would make me happy and excited for about ten seconds before I got bored of it. Seriously? People are upset over that? I'm way more looking forward to rolling some lowbies and as well as leveling my 80s. :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mordras</div><div class="date">2010-11-18, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Argent Dawn rep? Just run Strat a several times. Depending on the class of course it's fast to clear. With my DK I can do a baron run in 10 minutes. A full clear will give more rep though. You still have time if you start now. :D<br />
If you want Argent Dawn rep you better get it now. On the Beta I just took a character into Scholo killed a few mobs, killed a few bosses. No rep. I went to Strat, killed some mobs, killed the baroness. I did get rep from the broken cadavers and nothing else. The rep from those guys was either 1 or 2 rep. The other mobs didn't award rep. I was neutral with AD so it definitely wouldn't have anything to do with diminished rep.<br />
<br />
I did level a character through the beta that went through WPL and EPL. A few mobs in Andorhal gave some AD rep and I think one quest did but I think both of those are a bug. I was 200/3000 through Neutral with AD after going through those zones. The Argent Dawn doesn't even exist as a faction in the lore anymore so I'm inclined to think any mobs/quest that are giving you AD rep in the beta is a bug.</div></div><hr />
