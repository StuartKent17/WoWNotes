Legion - Artifact Respec Cost<br />
In Legion, you can go back and change the tree you are filling out for your Artifact weapon if you change your mind. While you eventually may be able to fill out the entire tree, doing so will take some time. <br />
<br />
The current cost to respec your artifact is however much the next trait or rank would cost you. If your next trait costs 525 Artifact Power, you will need to earn 525 Artifact Power to unlearn and regain the Artifact Power you previously spent. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-AtrifactRespec&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/april/thumb/ArtifactRespec01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/april/ArtifactRespec01.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/april/thumb/ArtifactRespec02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/april/ArtifactRespec02.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/april/thumb/ArtifactRespec03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/april/ArtifactRespec03.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion - Artifact Trait Costs<br />
In Legion, each artifact has a tree of traits you can unlock with multiple ranks per trait for some of the traits. The chart below shows the Artifact Power cost for each rank. Keep in mind that this isn't finalized and values can be placeholders.<br />
<br />
The Artifact power cost increases per total ranks you have purchased. For example, if you fill out 3 Artifact powers with a total of 3 ranks each, the next rank or trait will cost you 525 Artifact Power. The same applies if you just filled out 9 Artifact powers with 1 rank each. <br />
<br />
Right now the second through 11th ranks have an increase in cost of 25 Artifact Power per rank, but after that it becomes exponentially more expensive. <br />

Legion - Empowered Ring of the Kirin Tor<br />
The Kirin Tor rings (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Kirin_Tor_rings) may be returning in Legion! Sminx Glasseye (http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/93543-sminx-glasseye) sells the Empowered Ring of the Kirin Tor (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/139599-empowered-ring-of-the-kirin-tor) for &lt;span class=&quot;money-gold&quot; alt=&quot;g&quot;&gt;50,000&lt;/span&gt;. The vendor currently belongs to the old Kirin Tor faction, so it is possible there will be reputation discounts. <br />
<br />
Currently the ring has Intellect, unlike all of the other Legion rings and neck items. It is possible that this is just an oversight and the final ring will have Stamina instead.<br />

Has anyone heard of an official announcement, that gnome hunters will be playable in Legion pre-patch? Google was giving me no answers.<br />
Yep! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/722610964621754368))<br />

Draenei male's weapons are not scaling properly in Legion alpha. Id post an ingame screenshot, but...<br />
We're on it. Should look better in a coming build. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/722492836138975232))<br />
<br />
World Quests<br />
Re;World Quests. Are there a cap on how many world quests can be up in a zone at any given time in Legion?<br />
If yes, does that mean a profession quest could potentially bump out a non-professional quest?<br />
Prof. quests are deemed lower priority, if one tries to spawn in an occupied spot, it will try to spawn elsewhere (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/721768393297104896))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
mythic + dungeons will the be available at launch or delayed like raids? <br />
Current thinking: Mythic dungeons available right away; scaling keystone system unlocks alongside raiding. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/722229931069943808))<br />
<br />
Will Mythic Dungeons and the scaling have matchmaking or must you put groups together yourself?<br />
Just as on live today, players must form groups for Legion Mythics. The Premade Group Finder is great for this. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/722911145451859970))<br />

Yes (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/722878317280382976))<br />
<br />
I can't post on the forums but wht happens to the grey loot that drops? Will a random be able to steal it from you? -<br />
Everything is personal loot, even the old world. No fighting for greys. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/722877460769968128))<br />
I assume old-world doesn't have any fancy mob scaling like in Legion though? Just the open tag/personal loot feature?<br />
Correct (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/722878383491649536))<br />
<br />
Why don't rares have this HP scaling mechanic anymore? Devs seem to drop it in WOD rares comp to MOP rares.<br />
They should, if they're missing a scaling record, it's a bug (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/722887951651241986))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Hey Greg, you don't work at Blizzard anymore but you surely have thoughts about Nostalrius and the whole debate?<br />
I've been asked this a lot. I'm not going to pick a side about who is right or wrong because it's probably not that simple (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/723623809522143232))<br />
I definitely feel for the players who lost something. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/723623884851814400))<br />
But I'm sure Blizzard had good reasons. Maybe they had to protect their IP, because you can lose it if you do not. IDK. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/723624069149552641))<br />
I think most of you know that one thing Blizzard and I do disagree on is how much you should communicate with players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/723624235076190208))<br />
What is your stance if I can ask?<br />
I try to be as transparent with players as I possibly can be. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/723624896253693952))<br />
Blizzard had a different philosophy, which is fine. I don't begrudge them that. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/723624993104355328))<br />
<br />
Since the Nostalrius thing came up, what is your stance on bringing back vanilla servers officially. Sorry if asked before.<br />
Philosophically, if it was my game, I would think it was cool to try. But that still doesn't make it easy. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/723627191418773504))<br />
Technical challenges are massive. Players won't accept &quot;We aren't going to fix bugs on some servers.&quot; It's always &quot;Just this one?&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/723627004210241536))<br />

Actually this is just the last rank, overall its closer to a million right now.<br />
Personally I like this strategy, gets you a baseline quickly (getting 20 or so should be pretty fast), but maxing out takes effort.<br />

You can easily form your own group in the group finder tool now on live and ask for what ever ilvl you wish and all that process that like 5 min max at anytime of the day, and I am rly glad blizzard is sticking to that system and not go for that LFG garbage cause LFG/LFR + Difficulty don't match just like water and oil</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would agree with you but, the mythic+ dungeons are actually pretty challenging. They're supposed to be ''on par'' with raids on a smaller scale. So to queue for this with random people would be terrible, it'd be like doing raids on hc/mythic when they just released with complete strangers.<br />
<br />
Also i hope blizz isn't going to nerf the artifact power, since the first 20 ranks are easily attainable. I'm not one of those ''back in my day'' but i really love how they put very grindy things into the game, professions are taking forever too to get recipes.</div></div><hr />

I really wish they would reconsider this, what's the problem having LFG for this, people that don't like LFG can still form there own group or do guild runs like today, this way everybody wins.<br />

<br />
Sorry but that's not the reality of LFG. When you can effortlessly form a group, people aren't as dedicated to playing the game, because they can always find another group. These no-skill low-attention un-dedicated LFG groups also take people away from Premade Groups, so you have a smaller pool of people to form serious groups with. The ideal is that people can form whatever group they want, but that's not the reality of it, because a lot of people will choose the easy way out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you dungeon spam 24/7, a dungeon run takes roughly 15 minutes and the average ap you gain per run is 75, you need to be farming dungeons for 231 days while playing 24 hours each and every day to fully max the artifact weapon, this is a completely unrealistic value and even the most hardcore player in the universe won't play that much unless he resorts to botting. Either the ap rewarded from items needs to be increased or the ap requirement needs to get massively reduced.</div></div><hr />

they are delaying Mythic+ mode cause it drops raid quality gear so they are releasing them with raids, and they are delaying raids so ppl won't feel the need to rush the lvling experience.<br />
and I don't think 2 weeks of wait at launch is prolonging the content...no one buys the expansion and plays it for just 1 month if they are serious about the game.</div></div><hr />

That's it. If you eat so much that you get sick, well, that's up to you. It's always a possibility that someone chooses to do so, but it's his choice.<br />
<br />
Same with people who would choose to play 3 days non stop to level up, gear up and hardcore raid as fast as possible. For me, it's pointless, but they have the choice. And I prefer when games leave you to choose whatever you do than delay it &quot;for your own good&quot;.</div></div><hr />

But again, there is no incentive to do that in such short time. Chances are the majority of players will still be levelling while the people who dinged 110 after a few days are waiting around bored for their heroic dungeon queue to pop.<br />

No, I don't consider farming again and again the same thing for week and weeks just to increase AP something fun. For the same reason, farming mob for month to get get exalted with a faction is not fun.<br />

its meant as a tool for end game progression and clear over time nerf for instances - you arent meant to complete it soon- idealyu it should take you months if not whole first tier to complete it.<br />
<br />
yes i find mythic dungeons still veyr fun mainly because i never run them on 740 toons only on 670-680 ones which means they are decently tuned and fun. what i would find more fun would be if they put more mythic dungeons in game but this wont happen till legion</div></div><hr />

I can't wait to see the first &quot;need fully maxed artifact weapon&quot; LFM announcements for legion raids, and the related QQ in the forums.<br />

It's very poor design for multirole specs classes. The current design which allows to switch specs on the go is fine, I really don't understand why the try to make people commit to one spec FFXIV style.</div></div><hr />

And what about hybrids which are played as such? My priests are heal/dps, my paladins are either tank/heal or heal/dps or tank/dps, etc. I don't trust them making healing specs viable for questing.

They're applying a debuff in Mythic raids for the progression race, 1-2 months, that disables the special effects on the legendary &quot;passives&quot;<br />
They could very well do the same with artifact traits (talents) if we're unable to get them all before Mythic starts, or they could just delay raiding for a full month...</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a group that, allegedly, doubled their dev size -- it's odd how they've gotten *worse* at releasing content to the point they need to artificially inflate content to buy them time, which is how I'd interpret your feelings since you're continuing the analogy (which isn't meant to be literal, just an extension and rewording of how you feel). Too much content isn't a bad thing. It means you choose which content is for you.<br />
<br />
The only reason to have timegating at the release of something is so you don't have people compelled to call into work or else they are letting their team down. So long as the timegate allows to a *reasonable* amount of time to hit max level, then I'm fine. Once leveling is done, there's no reason for gating anymore -- not even for patches. Or LFR. Or *ANYTHING*.<br />
<br />
I think it'd be nice to fair from the dev's *AT RELEASE* how long they expect that content to last us.<br />

<br />
The thing about Cataclysm is they foolishly went from a relaxed fun dungeon style to a stressful multi-hour wipefest style. There was no transition, no learning curve --and-- GC mocked the players who flunked miserably which caused a rift between the regular raiders and the &quot;filthy casuals&quot;. It was, more or less, officially made that &quot;filthy casuals&quot; were no longer welcome in WoW. This was the straw that pushed people to cyclical playing. No more was WoW about relaxed fun but about stress and pushing new content then being done because rewards where shit.<br />

The respec cost is for changing the existing tree, you can change specs and equip your other specs artifact at no cost (in terms of artifact power).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Catch up to what? People who rushed 110 to quickly zerg arid content in a Hardcore Raid Race? Maybe their guild friends, okay. But if they didn't have time to play during the leveling period, chances are they won't have it during the time their guild will be doing raids and Mythic+. So now a guild that didn't progress with them because of their gear will now be unable to progress with them due to the fast that they can't play a lot?<br />
<br />
Again, it's all up to player. If he chooses to level as fast as possible, he should be allowed to, there is nothing wrong with his playstyle. This kind of timegating is quite unhealthy to the game, essentially cutting it into pieces to release at a schedule. As seen with Burning Crusade (a very well received expansion), players don't need this kind of babysitting. If you give them vast amount of content upfront, each of them will find something to do, and likeminded people to do it with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AFAIK you can farm AP for a different spec than the current one, also there is a mechanic that increases the AP gains, so other specs should take roughly 3-4 times faster. It's in the blue posts 1-2 pages behind I think, so I don't really see much problem in changing specs. It probably won't be any more of a struggle than now and if it is it will be brought back, because killing offspecs would definitely mean the end for this game.</div></div><hr />

They will have catchup mechanisms in place to help people who have maxed one to fill others more quickly. I will say at the beginning of the expansion there could be a bit more specialization - but by the time we get to the second or third tiers that should not be an issue. First tier it should be okay - just bring in some more people. Extendible size raids allow for that.<br />

<br />
Not going to 4 spec, but even just 2 will be a problem. Either you will be far behind in one spec and it will be crap in dungeon/raid or behind in both. Result will be the same, kick from raid or dungeon. It force you to focus on one only until you have enough gear to offset the weapon &quot;lag&quot;.<br />
<br />
They also mentioned some kind of catch-up for additional spec, to not grind as long as for the first. Anyone got some info on that ?</div></div><hr />

You currently need around 1 million artifact power to max out one artifact weapon (some spec need a bit less, some more). If one activity were to give you 100 artifact power, you'd need to complete 10 000 activity to max out one weapon. If you completed 10 activity per day, you'd need 1000 day to complete one artifact weapon. <br />
<br />
Even if you were to earn artifact power 3 times faster for your off spec, you ll still need 333 days to complete an offspec weapon. <br />

No one is forcing anyone to grind anything, it will come with time. If you force yourself to grind artifact power you're gunna have a bad time. Just do whatever is fun to you and it will accumulate faster than you realize, literally everything you do on the Broken Isles gives AP<br />

Actually I'm pretty sure we ll see artifact weapon requirements for guilds / raid groups in legion, knowing wow community. So you're saying nobody is forcing me, well I actually disagree. We re not talking about a mount or an achievement here, we're talking about improvements to the class core abilities or statistics.<br />
<br />
Also I know very well I'm not forced to buy and play legion, and what I'm seeing doesn't really entice me to do so. I don't really understand why there is still the option to change spec if you're being funneled into one spec, unless you grind a content you already have completed countless time with another spec. It's poorly FFXIV style designed time sink in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

I really wish they would reconsider this, what's the problem having LFG for this, people that don't like LFG can still form there own group or do guild runs like today, this way everybody wins.<br />
<br />
Sorry but I don't miss the old days spamming trade looking for group, or premade group finder groups asking for overgeared people<br />

You have been playing this fake WoW for too long. The point of an MMORPG is to find and play with people you like. I hope afking in the lobby (garrison, main city) and getting into causal nonsense difficulty content with a push of a (lfg) button is over. Find friends, find a guild or make one. #fucklfrlfg</div></div><hr />

BC released a crapton of raids and dungeons all at once, all modes unlocked, and throughout the whole expansion people didn't complain about content droughts. <br />
<br />
Timegating is a bad sign for me. It's a way to artificially prolong the content because you know there isn't a lot of it. Worrying about players &quot;burning through content too fast, so we have to restrict them&quot; is like serving the meal in small portions so you can enjoy it for longer.<br />
<br />
Even in BC, there was artificial gating. Whether in the form of Attunements (SSC, TK, Hyjal(?)), keys (required for those heroic 5mans in BC), or even long quests to gain access to Karazhan/BT, which only required one person and/or rogue to get you in (dunno about inside door) but still, you did it. <br />
<br />
Far as releasing everything all at once. Sure, doesn't mean anybody realistically skipped Karazhan, Gruul, Magtheridon and jumped right into SSC/TK (were these even in from the get go? I don't remember that far back). SWP was the first true raid gating they implemented after the first three bosses as everybody knows. I'm sure we'll all survive difficulties being gated a little bit as usual. ;)<br />
<br />
People complained left and right about everything in BC from PvP to PvE to pretty much anything. They did then, they do today and they will still complain tomorrow. And yes, they complained about any perceived droughts all the time as well as the flip side complaining about needing to do said content. Saying otherwise is silly talk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In BC and vanilla, gating wasn't artificial, as gaining access to the raids and dungeons was tied to meaningful questlines (some of them are part of my best memories from BC and vanilla), which were pieces of content. While you re right some dungeons were gated via reputation (which still exist nowaday), the gating was different from nowadays, because time gating isn't content. <br />
<br />
Aside from reputations, you could complete any vanilla or BC attunements in one day, provided you had the group for it. The point of attunements in BC/vanilla wasn't to delay your progress, it was to make sure you completed the content (which is something totally different). Typically, for the dungeon reputation of BC, you merely had to complete some quests in the area of the dungeon (which you would typically do while leveling) and run a few time the dungeons in normal mode (you couldn't jump right away in heroic modes dungeons anyway, as they were quite hard at the beginning of TBC).</div></div><hr />

How much artifact power are we getting per world quest? Per each rare? Per random dungeon/LFR? We might be lucky to get 50-250. To get 383k for the final point would be suicide. That can't be right. If Blizzard wants to murder off specs, that's a good way to do it. Alts will be just as bad. But hey, guess we have to rely on that artifact power increase acquisition item thingy that will increase artifact power gain by like 7x at the max. So instead of 50-250 artifact power, we'll get 350-1,750. That's still like 219 of the 250 artifact power quests/items to get the final artifact point. That's THOUSANDS of quests, rares, dungeons, and raids. Blizzard's really shooting themselves in the foot. That's insane.<br />
<br />
Supposedly we should take a few months to upgrade our artifact to max level, but how long is a few? Two months? Three? Six? Some world quests are once a week, some only a few hours. Raids reset once a week. Same with mythics. Heroics are once a day. Some rares are one time only while others are daily. Treasures are one time only. Many artifact quests are one time only. Say it takes 12 weeks to max an artifact, we'd have to (on average) get 138,298.75 artifact power a WEEK just to max out in 12 weeks. It's 103,724.0625 a week over 16 weeks if it'll take 4 months instead. At 16 weeks, that's 14,818 a day which is 60 of the 250 artifact power rewards. At 12 weeks, that's 19,757 a day which is 80 of the 250 artifact power rewards. That's insane and incredibly punishing. That's daunting and feels impossible. If it feels out of reach from the get go, many won't even bother trying.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping Blizzard reduces the amount needed to level artifacts because that's suicidal.<br />
<br />
And hopefully Blizzard is considering updating old rares like TLPD and even Aeonaxx, etc to use the new scaling open tap system so more people have a shot at the damn mounts. If we're spending hour upon hour in old content farming for an old item, Blizzard is failing because we should be in new content, not old. There's no reason for something in old content to be frustrating to get and forcing us to remain in that old content for longer just to get it. Faster we get out of old content, the better.</div></div><hr />

Currently in alpha from my experience, you get a token that grants 50 per completed heroic or 25 per normal dungeon. Each boss can drop a tome for another 25-50 IF your lucky. There are several quest chains that end with 100 power. Rares and chests can drop items that grant between 25-50 power. I cleared three zones and got about 3200 power with the odd dungeon here and there so the grind is real. In the older version of the alpha every boss had a chance to drop a tome for 100 power per boss so on a very lucky run you could come out with 400-600 power per run. But that has been nerfed to shit. I'm sure they will add a ton of stuff coming up especially in raids, world quests and elite quests.</div></div><hr />

Too much content isn't a bad thing. It means you choose which content is for you.<br />
<br />
The only reason to have timegating at the release of something is so you don't have people compelled to call into work or else they are letting their team down. So long as the timegate allows to a *reasonable* amount of time to hit max level, then I'm fine. Once leveling is done, there's no reason for gating anymore -- not even for patches. Or LFR. Or *ANYTHING*.<br />
<br />
I think it'd be nice to fair from the dev's *AT RELEASE* how long they expect that content to last us.<br />

The thing about Cataclysm is they foolishly went from a relaxed fun dungeon style to a stressful multi-hour wipefest style. There was no transition, no learning curve --and-- GC mocked the players who flunked miserably which caused a rift between the regular raiders and the &quot;filthy casuals&quot;. It was, more or less, officially made that &quot;filthy casuals&quot; were no longer welcome in WoW. This was the straw that pushed people to cyclical playing. No more was WoW about relaxed fun but about stress and pushing new content then being done because rewards where shit.<br />

<br />
Meaningful questline... Jeez, bit of a stretch there champ;) Naxx40 entrance was based on rep and it was a horrible pain to grind it out. Gated behind rep. (i still remember a few raiders who, while everybody else were inside they spent hours upon hours grinding out that crap rep. BWL was tedious (hint: not many liked bothering with ubrs). Gated behind long involved quest and no, you didn't complete it in one day usually. MC was easy once you learned the shortcut. Onyxia, gated behind a long quest. All required time. <br />
<br />
TBC zones, no, you didn't get to Honored (required for heroic keys) just by doing the quests in the zone, nor was it as simple as running a dungeon few times. Was a teensy bit longer to access heroics. Gated. Oh but grinding a dungeon multiple times for a little bit of rep was meaningful to you apparently. <br />
<br />
Raids: as I said Karazhan was about the only one which you could finish in a day, I guess assuming one person in your group has a key to all the 5mans required for the quest line...early on, yeah good luck finishing it in one day. lol. <br />
<br />
SSC required some 5man, Kara boss and some other raid boss. If your raid group is all on the same page, I could see all those being done in one day....albeit, an enormously long day. Gated.<br />
<br />
TK would never happen in a day, I still shudder at that chain. Very Gated.<br />
<br />
Hyjal required rep + T5 end bosses. If you did this before they allow people to bypass all other bosses, you'd know it wasn't a days work. A week, sure. You got Gated.<br />
<br />
BT, again a long quest line (fun one, too). Still Gated.<br />
<br />
The point? Everything that was locked behind keys, reps, major quest lines. That's artificial gating. They could've just had everything available, no requirements. Artificial gating historically isn't a bad thing since you found meaning in all of it. In fact, TBC was probably the high point for anything and everything being gated one way or another. =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a LOT of gating, but the gating was very different. It was based on effort, not time. <br />
<br />
Right now WoW has a lot of &quot;Wait x weeks for something to be unlocked&quot;, essentially cutting existing content to make sure there is something new to release instead of launching it all at once. BC didn't have that. Unlocking HCs, completing quests for keys and attunements - those could be completed in a day or less, depending on how much you wanted to push it. <br />
<br />
Say, Karazhan. In BC to gain access (key) to it you needed to complete a long quest chain, with lots of lore and travelling in it. Moreover, you had to complete 3 high level dungeons. Nothing super hard, you could do it easily in a few hours, but you had to show dedication to obtaining the reward.<br />
<br />
How would Karazhan key be treated in WoW now? Probably would be released after a month of the expansion release. And no way that someone gets the entry earlier than another, that's not fair to people who play less than others, duh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't remember grinding for reps in TBC (outside of netherwing), reputation came naturally via running normal modes of the dungeons and doing quests in the area while leveling. If you didn't do any dungeons while leveling then yeah you probably had to do a bit of grind. <br />
<br />
ALso, when I said you could do the attunements in one day, I was saying that if you were catching up and had a group which mastered the content, you could be attuned in one day (as we did in my guilds for newcomers back in the day, running SSC and TK in one saturday afternoon). Obviously, when we first completed the content, it took longer, but that's because we were trying to complete the content. It wasn't time gating, it was us trying to complete the current content before moving on to the next. It's not time gating, it is content.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I was fine with all of that. As I said, it was content. And those questline were actually great. And I never had any trouble finding groups for UBRS or BRD (including for quest runs).<br />
<br />
It is better than a flat out time gating with no content.</div></div><hr />

WoW has always been &quot;easy&quot; when you played with a solid group of players, but that was part of the reward. You don't have to make difficulties that everyone can do. Sometimes you need that big fat carrot off in the distance that you may never reach. You can argue that Mythics are that &quot;big fat carrot&quot; for most people, but I don't think that's true. When you can snack on carrots (Heroic) or baby carrots (Normal), what motivation do you have for Mythics? If you are wondering, LFR is like carrot juice. You don't even have to chew -- you just have to swallow (and try not to drown in the process).</div></div><hr />
