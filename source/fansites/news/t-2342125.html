RP Realm Rules<br />
Sorry guys for not catching this a bit sooner but I did want to reply to this.<br />
<br />
Since it hasn't been stated recently that I can find anywhere I just wanted to reassure you guys that the usual rules as well as the subset of rules for RP servers still applies. So if you're being harassed by players or seeing players with non RP names that are clearly ridiculous, please report them. We rely on player reports so as long as you are reporting these players our lovely Game Masters can investigate. <br />
<br />
While I love seeing the passion and influx that Project 60 has brought on and sparked into the community, its important to be respectful of players on these RP servers who are there because it is their place to have an RP focused community (hence the subset of RP server rules and server designation).&quot;<br />
<br />
I want to add an additional clarification that the naming rule is really the only thing that is separate from RP to other servers, and the rules on harassment are universal regardless of server type.<br />
<br />
The blame is not on the Project 60 community itself and most of the people running it have not endorsed any harassment and have been encouraging the opposite. I would attribute any sort of harassment/negative behavior to be an outlier and someone that would probably be doing it anyway even if it wasn't for the Project 60 influx. If you encounter this please just report it so our Game Masters can look into it.

World of Warcraft Arena - World Champions Crowned at BlizzCon 2017!<br />
Miss any matches? Forget the final? Wonder who won? Look no further! We have all the action from the Arena World Championship world finals at BlizzCon 2017 right here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1IU807_kLB0&amp;list=PLY0KbDiiFYeNMw-EDc6ViyIOKOGkRlJ7v).<br />

How Champions Are Made<br />
In the opening week, ten teams descended on Anaheim in the run-up to the finals, with two teams eliminated on day one.<br />
<br />
Panda Global took down Rockets Eclipse with relative ease, to be met by defending world champions Method: Triforce. Panda Global were on fire, with the fever-pitch energy of the crowd fanning the flames. They beat the champions 3-1 in the semi-final to win their place in the final.<br />
<br />
EU vs NA<br />
<br />
Across the bracket, the top-seeded North America team—Method Synergy—faced Europe’s second seeded team, ABC. ABC’s tried and tested formula of Alec on Mage and Niksi on Rogue, seen the previous year, worked like a charm taking down NA’s #1 team 3-2.<br />
<br />
ABC Easy As 123…4<br />
The finals in 2017 were once again NA vs EU. The comeback kids on Panda Global looked a little shaky and struggled to hold form, testing the limits of their passionate fans’ patience and creating a tense, exciting atmosphere throughout the arena. Sensing victory, ABC took full control; beating Panda Global in a nail-biting set of games 4-0—earning them their rightful place in World of Warcraft Arena history.<br />
<br />
Congratulations to ABC: World Champions!<br />

<br />
Its because they would rather not have to work and make unqiue ideas. They would rather not have to make individual class themes, and instead make one transmogable set for each kind of gear. IE Cloth,Leather,Mail,Plate. Its a joke, how pathetic this dev team is. They literally time gate content that is already there and call it new. Even worse are the morons who play the game. Yes lets pay 15 a month on top of a 60 dollar expansion. The player base is so stupid they cant even see how moronic they are. Doing random nerfs and buffs last second, isnt them fixing the game. They shouldnt get $15 because they take weeks to figure out small problems, or even months. But you know what, they get away with it. Im already dreading the fact of allied races. I see that as their turn to for new content from now on. They will just release reskinned character models that are already in game, that take no work to do. They banned players a while back ago for doing the exact same thing. I tried it out, it took me 10min to have the mod refit gear. Honestly i'm glad I cancelled my sub. I just play the PTR, and ill play the beta. However if they continue with this grindfest for kids, im done with WoW.</div></div><hr />

I'm really disappointed with t21 cause it breaks a lot of the smooth gameplay t20 has offered. T21 Shadow set forces you to play PI spec unless you have an ungodly amount of haste ( I heard ~ 18000). Set is still ok I guess, but I just see no point in playing my shadow over ele shammy anymore.</div></div><hr />

Guess that's still nice, as I'm playing this build even now, that's still an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm a bit disappointed regarding all the bonuses. None of them impacts your gameplay, most are flat upgrade or flat chance for upgrade. That's not the kind of bonus I like (same goes for legendaries).</div></div><hr />

The Legion tier bonuses are so horrendously uninteresting.<br />
<br />
That was also what Preach was saying in one of his videos. First Blizzard makes tier set bonuses as uninteresting as possible and then they come and say &quot;Well since the bonuses are uninteresting and people don't like them, we just remove them. Because we listen to feedback!!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
And it seems to work. I read dozens of comments of people loving Blizz for removing the bonuses.. It's crazy how easy/fast people can be manipulated.</div></div><hr />

Can't say I'm surprised, but if they wanted to phase out tier bonuses that is the way to do it. Ease people into it instead of just removing set bonuses that used to dramatically change your playstyle and overall power, in favor of a bunch of % based, streamlined boring crap.<br />
<br />
Then people with goldfish-memory won't care so much. Tier has always presented a problem with &quot;locked&quot; item slots but maybe try something new then, like entire raid-wide bonuses. 2/4/6 items from the same raid for some bonuses.</div></div><hr />

Tell that to a BM hunter ;)<br />

Dont know what is Blizzard trying to make with those changes. Want the people to use 2p/2p/2p.<br />

BULLSHIT<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daevied</div><div class="date">2017-11-22, 02:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its because they would rather not have to work and make unqiue ideas. They would rather not have to make individual class themes, and instead make one transmogable set for each kind of gear. IE Cloth,Leather,Mail,Plate. Its a joke, how pathetic this dev team is. They literally time gate content that is already there and call it new. Even worse are the morons who play the game. Yes lets pay 15 a month on top of a 60 dollar expansion. The player base is so stupid they cant even see how moronic they are. Doing random nerfs and buffs last second, isnt them fixing the game. They shouldnt get $15 because they take weeks to figure out small problems, or even months. But you know what, they get away with it. Im already dreading the fact of allied races. I see that as their turn to for new content from now on. They will just release reskinned character models that are already in game, that take no work to do. They banned players a while back ago for doing the exact same thing. I tried it out, it took me 10min to have the mod refit gear. Honestly i'm glad I cancelled my sub. I just play the PTR, and ill play the beta. However if they continue with this grindfest for kids, im done with WoW.<br />
<br />
just wait for classic wow, its not healthy to stick to something that is clearly hurting you that much :/</div></div><hr />

A higher item budget could compensate the tweak of the set bonuses. Not every bonus must be on a killer level - some classes still perform very well with not so good bonuses.<br />
<br />
Stop asking for passives that covers bad playing. In some points I can understand why blizzard is dropping set bonuses in BfA (yes it's is not selfless of Blizzard - the designers don't have to twist there brains to design useful bonuses). <br />
<br />
If Blizzards would drops all passive +gains - a big chunks of players would imagine that not the bonuses or the gear is the problem of bad performance.<br />
<br />
Having a strong +2 bonus and a weaker +4 bonus if fine by me - a +2 bonus is faster to gain - so the progression to tackle harder bosses in the raid becomes more easy - smoother progression.<br />
<br />
For me not playing a FOTM class with FOTM set bonuses was always a challenge that I like - keeps the game interesting for me.</div></div><hr />

Bring back Ghostcrawler tbh.</div></div><hr />
