They mention Horde.<br />

That was not a change btw. It was like that in 1.12.1</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh right, now I recall the thread where players raised concerns about being in caves and having dynamic respawns in starting zones being jammed. <br />
<br />
I had also more or less forgotten that it isn't released as 1.0. It's in 1.12, but content will be flipped on as it is on Live (patch comes out but raids open X weeks later) marking the phases, correct?</div></div><hr />

Yes, this is exactly the Classic experience. Have fun running up and down Felwood for the plants for buffs. And all the other things you had to try to get while a bunch of other people are doing the exact same thing. <br />

I personally just love all the creature comforts and quality of life improvements we have now. I like pretty particles and high poly textures. I like WoW tokens and flying really fast and so on and so forth. Sure, there are things I miss, the talent trees for one. But that's about it. The difficulty while leveling is also on my radar but not a huge deal. I've weathered 14yrs of these storms and I feel I deserve all the good things that retail has to offer, even if I don't 100% love every feature. I don't miss needing 90 buttons per class just to do 47dmg, but I do understand some classes were just gutted to nothing. Personally, as a Boomkin/druid main, I still feel I have so many... even if they're all useful and used during fights. Anyway, I hope you guys really enjoy.<br />
<br />
Edited: Plus, I know the entire story... so going back isn't going to be anything new to me. I did every quest possible back then just like I do now and I read the quest text just like I do now. So... it's just not fresh or exciting for me. I'm not going to be surprised or sad about story arcs because I know their fates. But anyway... ENJOY lol</div></div><hr />

So much of this. I also hope Classic is what all those people dreamed of, but for me its not it. What I want is the Classic difficulty and culture in the new content and I will never get that.. -_-</div></div><hr />

And yeah, saywhat has it right - Classic difficulty in current state of the game. This would be awesome. Maybe this is why a lot of remastered version of various games come out now? People are longing for past difficulties but utilizing modern technics.</div></div><hr />
