Warcraft Movie Update: Director Signed!<br />
We are pleased to announce that Duncan Jones, director of critically-acclaimed films Source Code and Moon, has signed on with Legendary Pictures to direct the upcoming live-action film based on the Warcraft universe.

Patch 5.2 PTR Official Notes Update<br />
<br />
Interesting Notes<br />
<br />
To encourage Raid Finder groups to persevere, each time an Raid Finder group wipes on a boss fight all players in the group receives a stacking buff that increases health, damage dealt, and healing done by 5% (up to a maximum of 10 stacks). This buff is cleared once the boss has been killed.<br />
Lorewalker Cho has two new tales to tell: Dagger in the Dark and A Little Patience. Though his mystical story-weaving magic (and well, the Dungeon Finder), both Alliance and Horde characters are now able run these previously faction-specific Scenarios. <br />
Characters that have attained requisite title levels (Centurion, Knight-Champion, Grand Marshal, High Warlord, etc.) through the Rated Battleground system will be able to purchase old PVP items requiring those titles.<br />

Power Word: Solace (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/129250) has been replaced with a new talent: Solace &amp; Insanity<br />

<br />

Sudden Death (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29725) now has a 25% chance to activate from Overpower (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/7384) instead of a 20% chance from auto attacks. In addition, using Execute (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5308) makes Overpower (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/7384) free for 10-seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Lorewalker Cho has two new tales to tell: Dagger in the Dark and A Little Patience. Though his mystical story-weaving magic (and well, the Dungeon Finder), both Alliance and Horde characters are now able run these previously faction-specific Scenarios. <br />
<br />

Reputation gains from bringing rare Pandarian fish for Nat Pagle to examine has been increased. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PTR Class and Set Bonus Issues<br />
We are making some additional changes. The ones below are mostly for PvP purposes and were based on a lot of PTR feedback, much of it from high-end PvP players. Until 5.2 goes live, these are not set in stone. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Q))<br />
<br />
Blind (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2094) - cooldown increased to 2 min (from 90 sec).<br />
Preparation (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/14185) - no longer resets the cooldown of Cloak of Shadows (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31224).<br />
Cloak of Shadows (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31224) - cooldown reduced to 60 sec (from 2 min).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
<br />
We agree that Retribution does not offer enough benefits to an Arena or Battleground team beyond just taking a Holy paladin. We are going to try a change where Hand of Sacrifice (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/6940) also dispels all harmful magic effects on the target for Ret only.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br />
<br />
Phantasm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108942) - no longer makes you untargetable. Movement protection increased to 5 sec (from 3 sec).<br />
Dispersion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/47585) - now belongs to the Shadow school, meaning it can get locked out.<br />
We are expanding the Shadow healing nerf to most of the priest healing toolkit. This means Holy and Discipline will have a passive that increases all of their healing by 25% as do most other healing classes. Holy and Discipline should see no change as a result, but Shadow's heals will be weaker. Remember that this will be partially offset relative to 5.1 because Shadow does get some healing benefit from PvP Power. (This note replaces earlier notes about Flash Heal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2061) and Binding Heal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/32546) being nerfed for Shadow).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k))<br />
<br />
Blood Fear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/111397) is now Blood Horror and is a 4 sec horror effect instead of a Fear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5782). It otherwise works as it does on the PTR.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#c))<br />
<br />
Totemic Restoration (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108284) - now behaves as though any replaced or destroyed totem was active for a minimum of 1 sec, even if the totem is dropped and grabbed for a shorter time period.<br />
Stone Bulwark Totem (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108270) - the totem now has 10% of the Shaman's health, much like Mana Tide and Healing Tide.<br />
Nature's Guardian (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/30884) - now preserves the Shaman's health percentage when it expires.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E))<br />
<br />
Second Wind (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29838) - we are reverting the nerf to the heal not working while stunned. We think we have nerfed Arms enough for PvP reasons in 5.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
<br />
Paralysis (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115078) - duration is now 4 sec from the front / 6 sec from the back (down from 4 / 8).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br />
<br />
Glyph of Deep Freeze (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44572) - now also lowers the stun duration of Deep Freeze (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44572) by 1 sec in addition to taking Deep Freeze (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44572) off the GCD.<br />
Ring of Frost (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/113724) - Presence of Mind (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/12043) will make RoF instant cast, but won't make it arm instantly.<br />
PvP 2pc bonus - the reduction in cooldown on Counterspell (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2139) is now only applied if you successfully use Counterspell (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2139) to interrupt (not Silence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/15487)) a target.</div></div><hr />

I sure don't like it. Blizzard first brought back the old PVP titles and gave them out to people with the new RBG system. Then they said they felt bad by invalidating us old school PVPers titles so they let us transmog vanilla PVP gear if we have the right Feat of Strength title for it. I for one was extremely happy with that and I know many others were too. <br />
<br />
I don't understand why they even bothered to let us be the only ones who could transmog it at all now if they're going to let everyone do it come 5.2. I mean no matter how you lay it out, getting the title High Warlord now is a piece of cake compared to how it was in vanilla. And I'm speaking as someone whos done it both times. Well I take it back I never got High Warlord in vanilla I only got Warlord. But still its close enough to make my point valid.<br />
<br />
And I'm sure people will argue with me that it took no skill etc to get rank 14 in vanilla but thats an argument for another topic. <br />
<br />
Meh</div></div><hr />

Bad choice Blizzard. Not only is this miles away from the style they usually go with with their games, books and artwork, they either need to throw millions upon millions on that flick to make the other races look equally good looking to humans, or in the worst case we will see bad cosplay quality elves and orcs or even worse an overdone focus on humans.

Oh, you mean like the game has been only the other way around for the past 2/3 years, with all the Alliance races being non-existent so everyone can focus on the Orcs' struggle and political problems?<br />

<br />
People went to go see Spirits Within simply because Final Fantasy was in the title. The film was still a financial failure to Square. I'm pretty sure Blizzard doesn't want that.<br />
<br />
I think you're looking at this from the wrong perspective. Was Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy films &quot;bad cosplay&quot; too? Or how about Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings? Fantasy can be done well enough with live action, CGI, and costumes. Whether or not this was the better move, is still up in the air. And its Blizzard, do you really think they're not ready to throw millions of dollars into it?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I actually couldn't care less about the film. Director is promising, but we'll see. Unfortunately, it seems to be incredibly difficult to make a half-decent film based on a video game.</div></div><hr />

as for pet battles: with no ability to one shot anymore (Flexfire Feline), the fact they removed powed leveling via Nishi and so many miss in battles I will probably just stop is alltogether. Even my deep freeze pvp team is screwed. Why do they spend time balansig it? They said it was supposed to be a mini-game and they wouldn't use ressources to balance it? I dare to say the nerf of FFF affects PVE more than PVP? PVP nerfs destroying PVE balance? I've seen this pattern before...<br />
<br />
At this point they should just remove misses.</div></div><hr />

That's pretty much standard budget - if it's just the budget for the movie and doesn't include cost for advertising that is. Curious choice for a director. His movies were good, but there were also a bit on the &quot;strange&quot; side. At least he knows how to handle actors, so there is hope. I'd hate to see good CGI but lame actors.</div></div><hr />

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting<br />
<br />
Hollywood accounting (also known as Hollywood bookkeeping)[1] refers to the opaque accounting methods used by the film, video and television industry to budget and record profits for film projects. Expenditures can be inflated to reduce or eliminate the reported profit of the project thereby reducing the amount which the corporation must pay in royalties or other profit-sharing agreements, as these are based on the net profit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Phantasm - no longer makes you untargetable. Movement protection increased to 5 sec (from 3 sec).<br />
So thats basicly back to squishy to everything than just melee<br />
<br />
<br />
Dispersion - now belongs to the Shadow school, meaning it can get locked out.<br />
Ok, your own fualt if you get locked out, but with some classes, you get bursted down in 1 lockout. GJ <br />
<br />
<br />
Halo will no longer hit enemies that are in Stealth.<br />
Because SPs are so OP vs rogues... for once .. Its not like druids in slealth kill us in 5 seconds :S OH SNAP!<br />
And since rogues are the interup experts, seems disperion will be useles against them as failsafe<br />
<br />
<br />
Power Word: Solace has been replaced with a new talent: Solace &amp; Insanity<br />
For Shadow, this ability causes Mind Flay to gain the Insanity effect when it's cast on a target with 3 Shadow damage-over-time spells on it. Insanity increases the damage of Mind Flay by 33% per Shadow Orb consumed.<br />
I liked the previous version, atleast that had some high crits on the fualt of the opponent that aided in what little burst SP had, the rotation was easy to learn. And I say had because the change in DP is just rediculous, it does les dmg statisticly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Glyph of Mind Spike only works from Mind Spike that aren't instant casts from Surge of Darkness.<br />
More burst nerf, it makes Surge of Darkness utterly useless in any instant it gets procced. Probably done to make the 3 dot double MF a challange. Atleast replace something with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flash Heal and Binding Heal will heal for 30% less when cast by Shadow Priests.<br />
Simply because we didnt die fast enough... VE is pathetic and Dp doesnt do wonders. I cant DPS a warrior with second wind/ MS up down, but a warrior can already instakill me with hots PoM and flashhealing myself. Oh good thing I wont have to try and save myself anymore.<br />

Nooooo. My A.I. is nerfed badly. It was fun too trow the same ability back at the enemy. I am ok with mr.biggleswort nerf tho. It has some survability at least. Flux nerf is also fine, it was anoying meeting 1 in pvp. (but it was funny when the same ability was reflected back into them)<br />

Each his own I guess. I kinda like the long dragged out buildup, despite being a bit repetitive maybe (climb the pit-&gt;fail-&gt;climb the pit again-&gt;fail-&gt;climb the pit again-&gt;win) All of the police force running into a tunnel was a bit far fetched as well, but the lock down feeling of a city gripped by a villain, and the outstanding performance by Tom Hardy made it all worthwhile. Maybe Anne Hathaway in a catsuit on a motorcycle helped a bit too.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't look like a good idea. I liked the &quot;It's just for my faction, not yours&quot; approach. This isn't a gamebreaking feature, and have little to no effect. Besides, how many players will be willing to &quot;help&quot; the opposing leaders?</div></div><hr />

Stop your whining will ya? <br />
<br />
And unless you learn ore things about movie making then don't talk. Tangled is one of the most high budget films ever and it is completely CGI. <br />
<br />
First of all a live action movie costs around 100 million as the post says. If they make a CGI movie it will ALOT more expensive. How the hell did you think it will be cheaper is beyond me.<br />
<br />
Secondly the team they have on making their CGI cinematics makes one cinematic for a year, which means they don't the people to make an entire movie. Again they will need to hire more people which will be alot more expenisve. <br />
<br />
You have no idea what you're saying.</div></div><hr />

Sam Raimi is a cheesy hack who should stick to producing. You can tell a bad director if their work keeps getting worse the more creative control they get as a result of earlier, more collaborative successes. Spider-Man 3 was drivel.<br />

Well, D3 had Jay Wilson and his gang doing whatever they pleased, whenever they wanted, up to the point Activision-Blizzard had to force them to release the game, when they decided they would spend another year playing developers. And when it backfired they proceed to ofend and blame everyone. &quot;Fuck that loser&quot;, remember?<br />
<br />
WoW have Tom Chilton putting the things players are interested in, and he is so confident that he even let crap as 75% of Cataclysm endgame go through so he can prove to everyone that he knows what bring people and what drive people away. People complained about the long waiting for development? He brought Marco Koegler to create tools for the developers waste less time hammering, and more time being creative.<br />
<br />
I hope that the next game director for D3 is a Tom Chilton's indication. I think he is scary as hell, but I love his work. And people like Metzen and Afrasiabi seem very comfortable with him in charge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are pretty extensive bluetrackers explaining the reasoning behind it. And the Pros will ofc get their loot and satisfaction from normals an heroics. All I know is this: I raided from 2005 to the beginning of 2012 and I raided always current content. (meaning later on when several raid difficulties were introduced we also did hardmodes). But life changes, priorities change and now I cannot raid anymore on that scale of 12 hrs a week that I used to. So I am glad there is a LFR I can pop in occasionally during the week and quickly see and kill 3 or 4 bosses.</div></div><hr />

Depends. On my DPS or Tanks? No, the queue is painfully long and the valor is only 10 more than the first dungeon of the day. My healers, on the other hand, get instant queues which make running it purely for valor much more attractive.</div></div><hr />

It's obvious for me, and for you that he is saying that Britney is successful at what she does, but lack talent. Same with Justin Bieber. If that is true or not is up to interpretation. The same goes with everyone complaining about Diablo 3. Some may, or may not like what they did with Diablo. Which is fine, but I don't understand why people have to be complete asses about it.<br />
<br />
As for whoever said that Blizzard tries to shift the blame on anyone else. What do you base that one? A single comment that Jay did about a guy that said something, probably honest, but less than flattering things about the game he spent many years working on. People are seriously too harsh, and has no clue what it is like to work in the game industry. It does not matter what you do, as someone will always complain. If it is too easy to someone, it is going to be to hard for someone else etc. You should all read this great article highlighting some of the issues that people in the gaming industry has to go through everyday, http://tardbunny.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/in-defense-of-jay-wilson-bullying-is-not-a-game/<br />
<br />
It seriously does not matter if it's a major game developer, or a indie game developer. There is no way that you will be able to satisfy everyone, and instead of providing constructive feedback people goes berserk, especially when they don't get their way, simply because they are in the safety of their home, protected from reality. I mean c'mon if you complain about Fifa being the same shit every year, it's not like there are people putting their heart and soul into making those games... right?</div></div><hr />

Hah, I am with you. I have mixed feelings about this change. Honestly, on average I found it took about 10-20 minutes per fish. Yes, I had dry spells where it took 1hour+ and those sucked. Keep in mind this is not completely wasted time. You can sell the fish on the AH, convert them into cooking tokens or even fish from pools for a chance at the turtle mount so you are certainly walking away with something for your troubles. End result is by far the best fishing enhancement in the game, and there is a degree of certainty to obtaining it (ie, you aren't directly competing for a rare spawn or something). It *should* be a PITA to get.</div></div><hr />

He obviously failed, because i'm not interested in WoW anymore :) But i guess i can't blame him. The game just got boring after 8 years of playing.<br />
I'll still watch the movie though, whenever it comes out.</div></div><hr />

It knocking people out of stealth was ridiculous in the first place. It covers way too high a range and was beyond stupid in arena. And rogue/druids dont have means to teleport to cover that range? oh wait! Honestly, if you get caught by Halo you are either to slow at making your move or to slow to react and run out of its lightspeed travel radius.<br />

Glyph of Mind Spike only works from Mind Spike that aren't instant casts from Surge of Darkness. <br />

I don't get this. So FDCL is now a useless talent? <br />

<br />
Well I'm going to assume that the movie is going to take place around Warcraft 1 or 2...to introduce the world to those who are unfamiliar with the series. NOW...that being said...the Orcs DID used to be pretty one-dimensional. They WERE mindless demon blood driven brutes. So yeah....probably gonna be more focused on humans.</div></div><hr />

Doubt that. He will just tell the story of how your enemy had to do those battles. You play them through your enemy's eyes. Not with help from your own npc's.</div></div><hr />

Just like Justin Biber, both are popular and successful, else they wouldnt be rich. Calling someone ignorant, because he never heard of a (hardly) medium successful director is blasphemy.<br />

<br />
No, it'll just be a one-sided movie focused on Humans in their fight against Orcs. Probably set up right befor the first war.<br />
<br />
Success doesn't mean anything and is irrelevant. Do you honestly want the movie to be really bad (Like Bieber) but make a lot of money or be an awesome movie that doesn't make much? I also suggest you look up what the definition of ignorant is since you're having some trouble. Might want to look up blasphemy too.<br />
<br />
If it were up to you, it would be directed by a popular well known moron like Michael Bay. I'd rather a video game nerd who actually has a world of warcraft account and loved the old rts warcrafts. He even loves the starcraft and diablo series. He's perfect for the job.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I really liked Moon - it was so much better than the &quot;action sci fi&quot; blockbusters we've been forced to endure for so many years now. Likewise, his Source Code; another great film.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think D. Jones will have a clue what to do with a Warcraft film. He is at least an Ultima fan. :)<br />
