Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator Now Available - New Skills Discovered!<br />
As previously announced (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/blog/3773320/World_of_Warcraft_Class_Talent_System-10_21_2011#blog) at BlizzCon 2011, class talents are undergoing some significant changes in the next World of Warcraft expansion. Learn more about these changes and test out different builds for all your favorite classes with our new Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator, available here (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/feature/talent-calculator)!<br />
<br />
We’re excited to be able to provide players with the opportunity to explore this new talent system and look forward to hearing your feedback. As with all previews, we ask that you please keep in mind that Mists of Pandaria and its class talents are still under development. This means that many of the spells and abilities you see in the Talent Calculator are not yet final and may change before release.<br />
<br />
This official calculator is full of surprises, spells have been updated since Blizzcon and new class spells appeared! Feel free to post anything new you might see in comments!<br />

Okay, here:<br />
<br />
You cast Alter Time at 100% health, 80% mana, and on top of a ridge.<br />
You jump down to the ridge, get attacked, down to 68% health, cast some, 74% mana, and you have a couple of DoTs on you.<br />
It is now 4 seconds later, you are returned to the top of the ridge with 100% health and 80% mana &amp; no DoTs, just like you would be if you never jumped down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so it's utterly pointless then, really.... 4 seconds is barely enough time to cast a spell.<br />
<br />
druid one looks interesting, though.</div></div><hr />

It does 10% splash damage to all targets between you and the primary target, can be activated as a CD for a burst period of 100% &quot;line splash&quot; which removes the passive 10% until the cooldown is ready again. -- the level 60 talent Spell Drain has replaced the level 45 talent Hour of Twilight, which appears gone. -- There's three brand new level 60 talents, which I won't bother explaining as you can just find them to add to this post on the 'lock calculator. -- Other new abilities and changes: Bane of Doom is now a Demo-only spell. It now summons a Wild Imp, which leads on to -- Wild Imps, new Demo spell, summons a number of imps depending on how much Demonic Fury you have; short cooldown, short duration, appears to cost more Fury the more you have, so a dump other than Meta. -- Immolation Aura is edited, it now makes Hellfire cost Fury not Mana when you're in Meta, and removes the channeling from Hellfire. Bit of a nerf to Demo AOE, no change to single target. -- Demonic Empowerment has a new name and heals the demon 25% as well. -- Shadowflame is now Demo-only, and after level 85 costs Fury during metamorphosis, appears as a Carrion Swarm and has a knockback (all only during meta.) -- Demo now gets Soul Fire to have a shorter cast time that is doubled (to long cast time) for 30 sec if you SF a target over 25% health. -- Destro gets Rain of Fire to not need to be channeled. -- Destro also gets pet attacks to stack a 0.1 sec reduction on soul fire cast time that stacks up to 40 times -- Bane of Havoc is now a cooldown that only has a few charges. -- There's no other Bane for destro. -- Affliction gets Soul Burn: Fear and Soul Burn: Health Funnel with new effects -- Bane of Agony is affliction only now.</div></div><hr />

Soon mages will have 5 specs, three for dps, one for healer, and one for tank. The game would then be called World of Mages. They would have spells like....Arcane Explosion: You heal everyone within 500 yards up to full health, even if they're not in your party. In addition, you kill all enemies within the raid or dungeon or any enemies within 1000 yards.I hate this game -.-</div></div><hr />

Nope - basically just execute.<br />

Assassination Rogues have already an &quot;execute&quot;, it's called backstab. At 35% target life it is used instead of mutilate. <br />

<br />
Backstab is actually a subtlety only move now. <br />
<br />
Also, Dispatch is more of an &quot;execute&quot; move than a backstab. Can't use until 30% or whatever the cutoff is on the life. <br />
<br />
Since Dispatch is assasin only, you'd be using mutilate anyways.</div></div><hr />

It's a friendly-target spell deal, lasts 1hr and persists through death.<br />

Boomkin places Symbiosis on Arcane Mage, Druid gets Arcane Blast, Mage gets Moonfire. Both DPS specs.<br />

Don't see the issue.... think of it kinda like Focus Magic or Dark Intent, cept rather than passing a buff, you pass a skill to them, and they pass one to you, for the next hour. What you get is based on your spec, and what they get is based on their's.<br />

Sorry but the clueless one here is you. Have a look at murderous intent in the assassination tree. Assassination rogues have already an execute mechanic <br />
At 35% target health you stop using mutilate as your main attack and change it with backstab. With MoP you can't use backstab so they gave dispatch with the same icon and the same mechanic, nothing changing, nothing new.<br />
<br />
The purpose of this change isn't to give you something new (yet... that is coming, give them time, you aren't the only class lacking in the 85-90 department).<br />
<br />
The purpose of this change is to stop facerollers who don't know how to play their class, from speccing Assassination and continuing to use Backstab when Mutilate is superior. This forces you to play the class AS INTENDED. It helps eliminate balance issues, when the intent of the class/spec is more straight-forward, eliminates cross-tree issues of balancing damage output and such.<br />
<br />
They wanted Backstab to be the main skill for Subtlety, while Assassination has Mutilate, and Combat has Sinister Strike. Blizzard obviously LIKED the talent-basis behind Assassination's usage of Backstab on low-health targets, so gave them it back again, as an execute-style skill, for the simple fact of making sure that it cannot, in any way, shape, or form, cause any balance issues with damage with Subtlety, because they use separate abilities now. ALOT of classes are being done this way now.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Mages: All start with Frostfire Bolt, at level 10, with their spec, get Arcane Blast/Fireball/Frostbolt.<br />
<br />
It's to eliminate cross-spec contamination and balance issues.</div></div><hr />

The druid ability looks interesting, but we'd have to know what ability is given to and from what spec, so it can actually be macroed &quot;symbiosys cast on you&quot; (enh shaman), feral druid now gains Feral Spirits, the enh shammy gains Tigers Fury.

Sad to see a once great gaming company turn into a greedy corporation more concerned with the bottom line than the game.<br />
Funny how those talents are so close to Diablo 3's set up isn't it.<br />
<br />
Oh and all you fools who will spout crap about &quot;Imagine that a company trying to make a profit&quot; need to remove your heads from Blizzards ass. Blizzards main goal these days is to monetize the player base as much as possible while reduceing development costs. They're in the process of training you guys for Titans RMAH and purchasable gear with Diablo's RMAH and guardian pups/cats whatever the fuck they are.<br />

Maybe you missed the blue post at the top that screams<br />

look forward to hearing your feedback.... please keep in mind that Mists of Pandaria and its class talents are still under development. <br />

Up from 10% currently.Might of Ursoc: Class-wide ability, increase health by 30% and increases health to 30% (if below that value). Lasts 20 seconds.Essentially all Druids are getting a Last Stand. Doesn't say that it requires any particular form either.Dash is a staple ability which means Druids will get 2 70% speed buffs for 15 sec. when talented into Tireless Persuit.It looks like a lot of feral abilities don't require you to shift to bear or cat first, instead when you use the ability it shifts you automatically.Thats all I see for now.<br />

<br />
No. Take a look at the skill progression tree for all rogue specs. Backstab is gone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thistlefur</div><div class="date">2011-11-23, 08:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG That new talent system is just stupid. Why do they insist on keeping us paying customers as Guinie Pigs!It might not be so bad if the talent were different based on the spec then it would make so much more sense and give you a true way to customize your character.<br />
<br />
So as an example:<br />
Beast Master Hunter<br />
<br />
15 – Roar [Imbues the hunter arrows with the roar of your pet. The roar causes the target to cower in fear for 5 sec.], Blood Spirits [You have mixed your blood with that of pet and through ancient powers poisoned the tips of your arrows with it. Each shot returns a small amount of health &amp; Focus to you and your pet. If either is full then double health restored to the weaker], &amp; Rabies [Your arrows have been dipped in Sylvia of rabid animals you have killed. Targets are infected with rabies which slows their attack speed 30% and makes them vulnerable to your pet’s attacks by an additional 15%]<br />
<br />
30-Intimidation [Same], Critter Bait [Shoots an arrow filled with a chemical concoction that causes all small critters in the area to swarm and attack the target. The attack reduces the victim’s ability to target you and your pet by 20% and slows spell casting by 60% the attack lasts till the pheromones wear off in about 10 sec], &amp; Fierce Charge [Command your pet to charge a target knocking him back 3ft., down, and out. Once the target awakens and his heart beats strong again the damages area from the charge will rupture causing 4000 dam over 5 sec.]<br />
<br />
Skipping to the end to add one thing I think hunters should have. <br />
<br />
90-<br />
Master of the Beasts [You have specially trained with your pet’s so well that you and your pets have become one. Your faith in your pets is so strong that you will not dishonor them by using weapons unless they are dead. Because of this pact you can also summon 2 pets at once. While both pets are alive they do 200% Damage and should one die it enrages the remaining pet giving it additional speed, agility, and damage. Should your last pet die you become enraged and your attacks become usable and are all instant and do 150% damage for 5sec.]<br />
Note: The % may have be higher or even lower based on how much dps is lost by the hunter not suing any weapons skills but only pet commands. This should also pop out a spell bar like stealth does that has all the commands you can give to your pet. <br />
<br />
Smarter than the Average Bear [You have taken your pets to the best Beast Masters in all the kingdoms to be trained in combat and tactics. This Training as increased all your pets’ stats by 10%, skills which give you 2 more talent points, and abilities causing your pets abilities to be the equivalent of being one level higher.]<br />
<br />
Pheromone Arrow [Your shots cause your pet to enrage and attack the with such ferocity that if he could be asked “Did you see that hunter” they would reply “What hunter?” The victim will only attack the or the corpse of your pet. The effect has a 5min. cool down.</div></div><hr />

Some of you are so eager to whine that don't even read the tooltips.<br />
Before you say how clueless people are again, I want to notice you of the fact that he is actuallly not that far off with what he said.<br />
<br />
Assassination has now got a talent called Murderous Intent, which reduces the energy cost by 15 per point (30 energy if you take both points) for enemies below 35% (and it is a talent that almost every assassination rogue takes)<br />
<br />
So that means backstab costs only 30 energy on targets below 35%<br />
This new dispatch talent costs 30 energy and is for when enemies are below 35%<br />
Both abilities require a dagger in the mainhand, and are only available for assassination specced rogues.<br />
Can you already see the similarities here? <br />
<br />
Basically what they did is combine Backstab with Murderous Intent (which will no longer exist in the new expansion because those talents disappear) and gave it a new name.<br />
The first major difference is the damage it does (this new one is 200% + X, while the old backstab is 150% + X) and make it available for L70+ only (not that that makes a huge difference because murderous intent was also only available for higher level characters, due to the talent system)<br />
And the second one is that this one doesn't have the positional requirement that backstab has/had.<br />
I have no idea how this will work out in combination with other damage modifiers, buffs etc.<br />
<br />
It is nice to see that we no longer have to do acrobatic moves to get behind the target for this execute move.</div></div><hr />

Couldnt agree more, for all priest specs. Totally jealous of the Druids and warlocks. Hopefully they will implement some neat spells in the future for as it stands it is bland and we basically didn't get anything new.</div></div><hr />

It seems each spec will have quite exactly the things they have in the current talent trees as baseline skills, plus some additional nice things. On top of that, the talent tree is not that focused on dps/healing/survivability (ie, not many must-have talents), but instead offers some really cool abilities for fun gameplay. Exactly what Blizzard aimed to do.<br />
<br />
However, many of the other classes seems to have a lot of talents focused on dps and such - I'm guessing many classes will see a &quot;this is the best dps build&quot;-builds and everyone will use it. Hope they will revamp them a bit more like the druids.<br />
<br />
Also, Symbiosis is a really awesome idea. Can't wait to see what the different abilities are that we will gain from each class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Backstab is also 30 energy for targets below 35% if you took the talent points in Murderous intent.<br />
The positional requirement(or the lack thereof) is the biggest difference, but they both do the same: do more damage as an execute moves on targets below 35%</div></div><hr />

Demo locks: Metamorphasis is a stance now? (no cooldown was listed) Will they be able to tank lower levels/trash, especially when combining the many self heals? Harvest of life spam (generating Demonic Fury and regenerating 2% health per target) + Immolation Aura with the 600% armor and -6% melee crit. I could definitely see Demo becoming the new drain tank.Prot Palys- Seal of Righteousness for trash mobs, seal of truth for bosses. Judgement of the wise+Sanctified wrath for a possible interesting rotation (Judge, judge, judge,WoG/SotR) Also, no cooldown listed on WoG. I'm assuming it will have one but perhaps shorter then before.Warriors: I'm disappointed in Berserker stance. It's really only a 10% increase on Whirlwind/cleave since Battle stance is a 10% increase on everything. After you subtract the 10% loss in auto-attack dmg, and assuming you could somehow spam it and not cast anything else without being rage starved, which you can't, and they have cooldowns anyways, it seems like it's not going to be a DPS gain on trash unless you've got an extremely large number of mobs. 3-4 it will probably be a DPS loss.</div></div><hr />

Think of it like this. It's another cooldown to save your healers mana.<br />
For example, on hc ragnaros, a trap is going to get popped, you use your Alter time and after the trap is done, youre on 100% life again, saved about 80k health healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can still make it quite easy to cap it, imagine this:<br />
u are running with the flag and pop alter time then you run the opposite direction (making all horde/alliance follow you that way) and after 4 sec you got a clear path blink afterwards and you got a nice distance between them and yourself</div></div><hr />

Resto places Symbiosis on a Prot Paladin, Druid gets Holy Radiance, Paladin gets Ironskin. Healing/Tank specs.<br />
<br />
It gives the Druid an ability from the other class, based on the Druid's spec, and gives the target an ability from the Druid, based on their spec.<br />
<br />
It is gonna make for some cool stuff happening.<br />
<br />
That's a really good idea of how it could work, but think for example about druid and hunter. What skill could hunter get? Spells would be just stupid, as hunters has no int, they also wont use any melee skill from cat form. The only thing would be some buffs/debuffs I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly - there are only one way to spec as either healer or Tank. There are no choises other than obvious and direct nerfs of basic abilites to do your job in that role.<br />
<br />
NOw... How bad is that if you look what other games are doing these days in giving ppl a real choise how they play ? Just look at RIFT where healer classes have diffrent specs available if they want to be AOE or single target or shield healers. ITs their choise depending on what is needed. Look at GW2 with items you equipp determining the abilites you get. Some are more role specific than others depending on the class. And look at the Secret World where you have absolute freedom to learn every spell and weapon you choose. Not even gonna mention SWTOR because ppl can just try it themselfs over the weekend.<br />
<br />
BLizzard has failed the basics. THe BIGGEST Critical issue with Cata were the childish talent trees and forced entry into 1 tree. All for the name of cookiecutter. But here is the thing. WOW is not just a raiding game - nor is it just a PVP game. It is also a Lvling game and 5 man dungeon game. There are LOADS of chances to create intresting and more open trees that benefit the players in the style and the content they play. But no.... Ghostcrawler is yet again playing god and killing the game big time.</div></div><hr />

Even you probably copy paste the build from wowhead or MMO , stop whining for everything if you don't have something to say just don't post. <br />
Nah, the guy was actually right. Many people enjoy min/maxing and understanding how their class works and how different talents affect gameplay and how your gear choices might change your spec. That's what they're taking away from us. And i for one enjoyed it a lot even before the &quot;talent trim&quot; of Cata. <br />
Blizz says that this is meant to kill cookie cutter builds. Imo they'll be more present than ever before. Atm gear influences the way you chose to spend your talent points for most specs. Like resto shams speccing into Focus Insight after getting Necromantic Focus. So players at different levels of gear do or should have different specs. They won't anymore come MoP, that's clear by looking at the talent choices we're getting: 3 specs, 3 talents to chose from. I doubt a feral druid will be picking up resto talents. Or enhancers picking up Tidal Waves al lvl 45. So everyone will be picking up their spec's talents.</div></div><hr />

2 things:<br />
First, maybe your class isn't done yet but as a Shaman I have multiple rather meaningful choices in regards to which talents I want to use for healing which fight.<br />
<br />
Second, I played RIFT. And I still keep up with it on raid mechanics. There is very little choice in RIFT. It presents you with thousands of options, of which all are rubbish unless you pick one specific one.<br />

<br />
If they are not finished then they should not be shown at all. And there are not only no 87 abilites yet... Many of the current classes dont have a real 90 spell or ability. Some have very childish and underwhelming ones while others have the most powerfull ones ever seen in the game. <br />
<br />
BLizzard should be ashamed of themselfs and the way they are dealing with talents atm. Players did not like the CATA talent system cause it was locked down.

In this case twist of faith and archangel. Also sad to see mindmelt becoming a choice between PI, twist of faith or mindmelt as the talent originally made shadow somewhat more unique regarding mindspike. <br />
<br />
Is it me or are there no new leveling abilities introduced either from 85 to 90 (such as we had inner will, leap of faith and mindspike). Talent abilities dont count imo as they either replace existing ones, are passive or you had them the first place.<br />
<br />
edit: for people saying its still work in progress, during the time between blizzcon and now with the preview, there has not been major improvements yet or rework. Does not give a hint of or glimmer of hope that they can push it in the right direction. Imho talents should now be entirely optional for given class spec/role. No passives either, bake that stuff into the spec itself.</div></div><hr />

The abilities aren't in yet, some classes have a few of their 85-90 abilities, others don't. Obviously they're still working on the trees and abilities.<br />

<br />
1. Yes exactly - some classes get choises. Others dont. Specially the classes that have 3 roles to cover. SHamans have only two roles so much easier to give them 3 choises and make them usefull. <br />
<br />
2. Exept WOW or RIFT are NOT just end game content. Its part of it and when you reach that level you should realise how your character is the most effective in his job. But there is ALOT of diffrent content in the game that people play and have their own builds for. I got some absolutly stupid looking builds that I do in RIFT dungeons but they are awsome fun to play as healer with a side role as a dps in a good group. <br />
<br />
Thats the thing that freedom gives you. You change things depending on your OWN skills, gear and ability to make it more effective for the content you are doing. WOW gives ZERO options of this since after all - a healer is only a healer (unless you are a priest ofc that can do massive dmg as well as healing in 5 mans and that is not considered to be a balance issue) and is forced to play one way - no matter if he is leveling, pvping in arenas or battlegrounds, doing 5 man dungeons, 10 mans or 25 mans. Its all the exactly same junk of a talent tree and if something - that will become even worse in MOP.</div></div><hr />

Eeeeh, a Shaman picks between Ghost Wolf Snare Immunity, 6s raid snare immunity and 6s raid silence/interrupt immunity at lvl45.<br />
While all 3 PvPish in nature, depending on fight some can be strong choices, in a snare-fight the first two are nontrivial to choose from.<br />
<br />
Likewise, I cannot see a Resto ability a Feral could pick up without opting for another healing-type ability.<br />
The only such tier is lvl30, and since both Cenarion Ward and Nature's Swiftness can be highly useful as a Feral, that's hardly a trivial choice to make with Renewal (you could however argue Renewal is a comparatively weak choice for Resto, yes).</div></div><hr />

I play Rift now and I see tons of choice, raiding within the min/maxed 5% isn't all the game is, outside that you can choose from several specs, for solo play there is an even wider array of choice when it comes to spec. Just because you can't find a use for some talents / specs doesn't mean some one else won't, that's what's nice about having a multitude of choices to make, you can choose to follow the min/max mainstream or you can choose not to.<br />

The way I see it: <br />
- you use this on a friendly target<br />
- Depending on what spec you are (resto will receive a healing ability and so on), you receive one of their abilities (Im betting you cant really choose)<br />
- The ability they get from you probably will work the same.</div></div><hr />

For resto shamans, my other main, I have problems finding the fun stuff that feels very cool to get every 15 levels. Druids are somewhat better, especially the improved forms, but the level 90 talents again seem rather lack luster. Again, nothing is set in stone and it will probably be fine once out, but at the moment I was hopping for a bit more (to be honest though, I didn't expect the talent trees to be revealed this soon)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then you'd reach max level and go to Google and type in, &quot;best xxx spec 85 patch x.x&quot;, and copy it in game. Or ElitistJerks. Or MMO-Champ. Or some other site.<br />
<br />
Just like you do right now. Oh, unless you like underperforming, in which case you'd just wing it and end up getting carried through just about everything.<br />
<br />
Let's face it, Blizzard are not interested in making crazy ass hybrid trees anymore. They don't want you to go 12/12/12 or 14/8/14. It's not their design philosophy, as it led to specs being amazing for a certain fight, and completely shithouse on others.<br />
<br />
They aren't going to change their minds about that soon, so if it's really that big of an issue for you...bad luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they offer the illusion of choice. If you're choosing between +1% frost damage and +3% hp, it isn't an interesting choice. If you pick the +3% hp one for PvE, you're bad. If you pick the +1% damage one for PvP, you're bad again.<br />
<br />
That's what the old talent trees were. People who can only see this in a matter of numbers don't understand &quot;quality over quantity&quot; just got fooled by the illusion of choice that never existed with the old talent system (where if you didn't have a specific build, you WERE bad, no question about it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
better knock on wood then and hope for the best :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abysal</div><div class="date">2011-11-23, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nah, the guy was actually right. Many people enjoy min/maxing and understanding how their class works and how different talents affect gameplay and how your gear choices might change your spec. That's what they're taking away from us. And i for one enjoyed it a lot even before the &quot;talent trim&quot; of Cata. <br />
Blizz says that this is meant to kill cookie cutter builds. Imo they'll be more present than ever before. Atm gear influences the way you chose to spend your talent points for most specs. Like resto shams speccing into Focus Insight after getting Necromantic Focus. So players at different levels of gear do or should have different specs. They won't anymore come MoP, that's clear by looking at the talent choices we're getting: 3 specs, 3 talents to chose from. I doubt a feral druid will be picking up resto talents. Or enhancers picking up Tidal Waves al lvl 45. So everyone will be picking up their spec's talents.<br />
<br />
Except they aren't really taking it away that much. The old system was calculate the modifiers of each talent, ignore the rest. Now we get all our passive buffs automatically so any of the maximizing no brainer &quot;talents&quot; are built in for us. Our choices are mostly utility now with the occasional exception. But for those of you who like min/maxing, it's still there in the sense that you still have to figure out your priority system. If you don't calculate the which spells to cast over other spells, you're going to see a significant drop in DPS. <br />
<br />
Also, you're wrong about most of the talents. Most of the tiers for hybrid class aren't DPS vs heal vs mitigation talents. It's usually 3 DPS talents, mitigation talents or healing talents in the same tier. For instance, for druids lets look at it.<br />
<br />
Tier 1 you get to choose from 3 movement buffs, 2 of which turn you into cat form, the other working better in cat form. How is this cookie cutter for Resto?<br />
<br />
Tier 2 you get to choose between an instant cast heal/CC on a 3 minute cooldown, a self heal on a 2 minute cooldown, or a single use &quot;shield&quot; heal on a 30 second cooldown. Obviously, guardian will take the self heal unless healing touch buffed by 50% is significantly greater than 30% of your max health. The other Feral and Balance will have little use for any of them. Resto will have to chose between a long cooldown big free heal and a short cooldown shield. Again, not cookie cutter, hard choices must be made.<br />
<br />
Tier 3 you get to chose between a speed debuff to fairie fire, an AoE root, and a knockback. None are significant DPS, healing or mitigation gains. Nothing cookie cutter here.<br />
<br />
Tier 4 you get to choose between 3 talents which help all specs. You get burst from incarnation, throughput from Forces of Nature, or an interesting DPS/HPS buff for using your specs charge. You'd think the healers would automatically take the charge, but because it moves you to the targets position, it has the potential to be suicide on certain fights. This tier *might* end up cookie cutter, it will depend on how close the math comes out.<br />
<br />
Tier 5 you have 2 bear form only abilities and another one that shouldn't be used outside of bear form. Why would a non-tank want to pull all enemies to him? This tier isn't cookie cutter, it's just idiotic.<br />
<br />
Tier 6 is mostly for PvP. You shouldn't be shapeshifting much in PvE. If there is a specific mechanic that requires you shape shift once during a fight for 30+seconds then and only then would you bother with heart of the wild. If you aren't frequently using your non-spec abilities, master shapeshifter is useless. Assuming you occassionally switch out to self heal as a bear or kitty, it can be a slight DPS gain, but I doubt you'll ever go feral and attack as resto or balance on a Raid and thus it's useless to you. Disentanglement is nice but if the fight doesn't root you it's useless. Meanwhile, in pvp all 3 of these have great usefulness.<br />
<br />
So again, how is that cookie cutter? I saw 1 tier out of 6 where there was obvious min/mix DPS/HPS gains and that is pending the numbers.</div></div><hr />

We have to choose between piercing howl and throwdown... or a super snare that's procced by autoattacks/rend ticks.<br />
<br />
Throwdown imo, just like for Pally I'd go with HoJ, but that's speaking merely for non-BG PVP.</div></div><hr />

I'd assume it would work the same as Enslave Demon<br />
<br />
And do you people even understand the new talent system vs the old?.. The old didn't have choice at all because every single person always took the same talents except for maybe a few so what's the point?? All blizzard did was merge those talents everyone took anyways so now you don't have to bother wasting any time clicking on them.. /facepalm</div></div><hr />

I wonder if they'll be able to cast Alter time somewhere outside the flag room, blink to the flag, grab, and be back where they cast Alter time, outside the flag room. Interesting to say the least. I haven't played my lock at all, does that portal thingy make you drop the flag? If it doesn't I guess it's basically the same thing.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't mimic *any* skill, it mimics one certain skill based on which class you choose to cast on and what spec you are.<br />
<br />
So from a DK a tank druid might get death and decay, a cat druid might get howling blast, a moonkin might get death coil, and so forth. In return a DK tank might get a druid's barkskin etc etc</div></div><hr />

the tooltip says it gives both the druid and the target a spell based on there class and spec, wich strongly suggest that the ability's you gain/take wil always be the same, otherwise you could get worthless ability's ( shield wall as druid for example as you said)<br />

Warriors are not finished - several of their abilities have a rage cost of 80. However, considering half the abilities you listed are +X% static uninteresting effect, most of those will probably stay removed. Stuff like Vigilance, Rallying Cry, and others could stay.<br />
<br />
Another part of the stuff you listed is irrelevant. For example, Shield Mastery was completely baked into another ability except the magic part which no longer makes any sense because Shield Block is a zero cooldown ability that only blocks one attack now.</div></div><hr />

Its a very simple reason theyre put out these changes this early, even if its not done, THEY want feedback, so instead of bein so negative and that the world is going to go under cause of these changes, try to give them some useful feedback. Theyre tryin out something new, yes I agree it might be a bit simple with the new talents, but then again, I spend 99% of my time on the encounters, not concerned about my talents now, why should that differ if they would add 10 new talents to the old system? Always some talents that beats others, no matter if its movement or dmg, most likely ppl will choose the dmg ones since the movement part is easly solved by approaching the encounter in a diffrent way. So stop bitching around and actually give them some real feedback why you think your new stuff is bad, and what they could do to make it better, I assure you they will listen more to a constructive post of feedback, than, oh now its easier than before, i will go play rift cya...After all, theyre here to make money and with 5.0 they try to change the approach a bit, its a long time until its live, alot of changes will be done, if you feel something is wrong and could be made better, explain to them in examples on their forums and group up and im sure they will consider it and see if its doable. Personally I think the mage talents are a bit to much PVP focused. But then again, u cant get everything in life, so I guess i suck it up and do the best of it.</div></div><hr />

With most specs you now have 2-4 maybe 5 if you are lucky talent point left who can be spend freely and wich won`t affect your dps in any way.<br />
With MoP you have 6x3 talents (wich once finished) SHOULD be optional and don`t affect your dps, so just because the tree has been cut down doesn`t mean you now have less choice, you now have MORE choice because most will not affect your dps ( or all 3 talents will give similair dps gains)</div></div><hr />

So if you were to look at a bunch of peoples specs and compared them all.. you would have more choices vs the new?? I think not.. More clicks doesn't mean more choice when you and every other person took 90% of the same talents anyways<br />

technically, yes<br />
it says it will completly reset the mage ( health, mana, buffs, debuffs) so you could get a extra 4 sec hero, but because the spell wil most likely use a global cd you would have 2,5 sec extra hero</div></div><hr />

<br />
BUT THE OLD SYSTEM HAD 70 TALENTS AND THIS ONE 6 THUS IT SUCKS!<br />
Completley ignoring the fact that those 70 talents HAD to be spent in a certain way or else you were BAD.<br />
Yes, yes, some specs had like a 4-5 point leeway to put in skills you hardly use anyway because it didn't affect your DPS/HPS<br />
<br />
So many people are blinded by the illusion of choice and quantity over quality, it's sad really.<br />
Now granted, some of these trees need work: But that's why Blizz released them. So we could provide feedback and say that cookie cutter still eists for spec x and that the need to adress that</div></div><hr />

At least, I hope so. Right?<br />
<br />
there is a chance that it will be added, but also a chance that it will not. The talent calc is a work in progress and a lot of talents are going to be changed/reworked, but since ( as far as i know) searing totem doesn`t get removed impr. lava lash should still exsist</div></div><hr />

<br />
most new talents are all similair ( movement increase, healing, damage reduction, death prevention) all things that do not directly impact your role. Some things will ofcourse be beter then others for a certain spec, especially with druid/paladin/monk since they can all tank,dps and heal but the majority of the talents will be choices that are not going to result in a something major like a 2k dps loss ( extreme example i know)</div></div><hr />

Are you kidding me ? I can't speak for PVP, but in PVE if you didn't copy Elitist Jerks' exact spec you were pretty much a baddie. That didn't leave much room for choice, did it ?Some of these new talents still look mandatory/more practical than the others for PVE, but I hope the difference in performance isn't too drastic so we can still choose whichever we like. :)</div></div><hr />

Nothing new, renamed Backstab -&gt; Dispatch.<br />

Except this one doesn't require you to be behind your target, it's an awesome quality of life fix. It means they're listening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the new system is very good change, now a firemage is really a firemage and a frostmage a frostmage. <br />
<br />
no more mage who is basically an allround mage but who's firespells are a little stronger than the ones from the frostmage. imo the different specs are much more distinct and thus much more interesting , especially the so called pure dds.<br />
<br />
and the few talent choices you have and which you can exchange as fast as glyphs are really good.<br />
<br />
i never imagined it'd be so hard to say which one i'd use for each tier.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woebegone</div><div class="date">2011-11-23, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As far as I can tell, this will accomplish exactly what was intended - add variety and complexity to builds, while trimming down the amount of points you need to distribute. Job well done.<br />
<br />
In the old system you'd have one great mobility, survival and/or dps talent for each tree, and it was always an obvious point to spend - no one specs subtlety and skips shadowstep or shadowdance. Now you have access to the mobility and survival talents from all builds, but you need to pick one at the expense of excluding two others. When shadowstep is up against preparation and a new sprint talent with immunity to movement impairs, it isn't looking that obvious anymore. Not for me atleast.<br />
<br />
How can this be seen as dumbing down the system is beyond me. One hard choice adds more complexity than thirty obvious ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Templars Verdict : a powerful strike that deals 39% of weapon dmg and consumes 3 holy power (i don't know what others think but 39% dmg + powerful don't mix in my mind)<br />
Divine Storm : causes 100% weapon dmg to all enemys within 8 yards, consumes 3 holy power ....<br />
<br />
i read .... paladins we say you use ds, and if you don't we will nerf anythin other into the ground, until you have too<br />
Yes, because it can't be a typo, it can't possibly scale with some stat and obviously these talents/spells are final and will definitely not change EVAH!!! You are screwed, just quit already!</div></div><hr />
