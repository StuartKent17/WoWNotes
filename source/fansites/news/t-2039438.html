Warcraft Movie - No Director's Cut<br />
It looks like we won't be getting a Director's Cut of the Warcraft movie. <br />
<br />

Action Cam Removal<br />
Recently, Blizzard posted a message stating they were going to be disabling action cam for the time being. Apparently, &quot;more than a few players&quot; were accidentally enabling the action cam feature.<br />
<br />
I'm completely befuddled as to how this would happen. It's a console command, therefore you have to go completely out of your way to enable it. It's not something you could click in the interface by mistake.<br />
To clarify: This experimental mode is/was apparently being enabled in some cases through no direct action of users. The concern isn't that people could somehow accidentally type &quot;/console actioncam full&quot; and then be bewildered regarding how to disable it. The concern is that people have logged into 7.0.3 and found some of those features defaulted on, with no indication to that effect, and the game does not provide any clear direction regarding how to disable it.<br />
<br />
&quot;Action cam&quot; will return. It was an in-development feature that ended up being accessible to players in one of our beta builds, and when we saw how much fun players were having with it, we decided to keep it around as a hidden toggle rather than disabling it immediately. It seemed harmless at the time. But there is now clear evidence to the contrary. The mode needs some extra safeguards, and we need to make it easier for players to know whether portions of it are enabled and if so, that it's an experimental feature, and how to disable it. That isn't possible without a real patch (that is to say, not a hotfix, but rather a new patch number beyond 7.0.3).<br />

Invasions and Demon Hunters Arrive August 9<br />
We’re pleased to announce that the next stage in the World of Warcraft: Legion pre-expansion experience will kick off on August 9!<br />
<br />
With maintenance in each region, starting on August 9, the Burning Legion’s incursion on Azeroth will get underway, and players who have pre-purchased the expansion (https://battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-legion) will begin creating their first Demon Hunters.<br />
<br />
We have more for you in our Demon Invasions preview (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20175682/legion-demon-invasions-preview), our Demon Hunter guide (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/classes/demon-hunter), and our Legion digital comic series (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20167292/new-comic-world-of-warcraft-legion-1-magni-fault-lines).<br />
<br />
We’ll see you at the defense of Azeroth!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2016-07-31, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whoever is writing the responses on Blizzard's end needs to be taken off that duty - the previous post about the camera made it sound exactly like it was a thing players were doing wrong, and now we get a two paragraph word salad that could have been as simple as &quot;Hey, we screwed up, it was experimental, we don't know why it's toggled on by default, we're turning it off, our bad.&quot; <br />
<br />
That's one thing I miss about GC - he could give a complicated response when warranted, and keep it short and sweet otherwise. Half of the fires that erupt over this game are from people who can't communicate clearly. Hire someone who can! <br />
<br />
And, not surprised by the Director's cut - there's too much CGI needed for pretty much any scene, and I doubt they rendered enough footage to make one. They may have the motion capture and voice tracks, but they generally don't green light millions of dollars of CGI for DC dvds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup. They even said directly that it was &quot;experimental&quot; and &quot;in-development&quot;, which clearly means it's not a permanent fully-formed feature.</div></div><hr />

If you actually have a problem with how Legion has unfolded, then gtfo cause you are either just a troll or so bitter that you may as well find another game to play. There has been no problem with cut content in Legion. <br />

That and make a terrible movie with terrible actors. When your CGI orcs have better acting chops than your human counterparts and one of your most known guys is the guy from vikings, you know you've done fucked up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I know. All movies should have actors that have stared in tons of things to make them great. It's like comparing Great Value food to brand name food. They should have had The Rock as an orc for sure.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the acting was fine. We don't need a countless number of hollywood movies loaded with the same stale known name actors.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the movie was fine. People here with no knowledge of warcraft even liked it as a fantasy movie.<br />
<br />
There are 40 minutes of missing footage which were yanked from the movie. i hope they were mostly included as bonus scenes if it wasnt possible to splice them into a directors cut.</div></div><hr />

And when you let the critics see it early so they can trash it for two weeks before it debuts in the U. S. I will always wonder what the opening weekend would have been if there had been no reviews beforehand.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenjen</div><div class="date">2016-08-01, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">someting is activating the action cam (which currently is only in the command prompts) for some players randomly. They dont really know how to deactivate it. plus it really wasnt intended to be used this way unless players in the know purposely activated it in command prompts to try it out. So they had to disable it. <br />
<br />
It is still being refined and touched up on. Since in its present state, a percentage of people sensitive to motion experience motion sickness, etc without the smoother refinements the completed product calls for.<br />
<br />
A UI element cannot be included right now, because those require actual patches and not hotfixes. There are addons that basicly just do the script commands though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The acting was not fine. And I agree you don't have to have well known actors, but it helps if you at least have good ones. I just finished watching season 1 of Stranger Things. Perfect example of amazing actors that aren't well known. I'll be looking forward to the Stranger Things sequel while you guys can look forward to the straight to dvd chinese warcraft sequel with english subs.<br />

Yes. Warcraft: critics: 30% (including that wiseguy saying it was worse than Super Mario and War on Earth, yet he gave Jupiter Ascending 85/100 and Dragon Ball Evolution 4/5, no comment), 74% from over 100k imdb users<br />

Very hard if you're unaware of its existence. While I spend probably 20-30 minutes just pouring through patch notes and at least as much time browsing sites like this for every little takeaway, I recognize that not everyone does, nor should they be expected to.</div></div><hr />

S. I will always wonder what the opening weekend would have been if there had been no reviews beforehand.<br />
<br />
Much better I think. <br />
<br />
My guildies and I were talking about that when the movie came out, there were so many front-loaded negative reviews from critics. If you look at the history, most of these guys were writing something negative every time a new trailer or press release came out before the movie launched.</div></div><hr />

When your CGI orcs have better acting chops than your human counterparts and one of your most known guys is the guy from vikings, you know you've done fucked up.<br />
<br />
I thoroghly enjoyed the movie. They broke from lore a little, left room to grow, and the CGi was awesome. Some of the acting was a little bland, but aside from some tiny lore things, It was actually great.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, it was enough to just have my camera offset from directly behind my character's back; gave the game a more dynamic feel overall.</div></div><hr />

You mean, the first stage started? All I saw was a bunch of ridiculous class changes.<br />

Oh, and a lot of dying in stormwind for a dozen gray items...<br />

The fight you saw IS in the game, it's just not Azshara you're fighting but some nameless handmaiden of hers who has been infused w/ Azshara's power.</div></div><hr />

You can't really have a lore character like Azshara be some dinky little dungeon boss &quot;though we did have her in the Well of Eternity dungeon&quot; she is now more powerful and would want to be a raid boss.. :)</div></div><hr />

So it doesn't bother me unless legendary is withholding a Completed directors cut.<br />
<br />
Director's cut almost never reshoot material - the costs to reassemble a cast and crew, sets, costumes, etc. months or years after is so expensive it's not even worth considering. Usually what Director's Cuts are, are new edits with material unused the first time (stuff cut for time), and maybe some voice over changes and such. I can't recall a single Director's Cut that involved newly shot scenes - if there are any, I'd love to hear which ones, out of curiousity's sake. Star Wars is the only movies i can think of where new material that didnt exist was added, but it was mostly stupid things like adding Jabba or alien beasts in backgrounds. <br />
<br />
The issue is, with a movie like this, that's so CGI heavy, is they have to film and render the scenes in the first place, and if the scenes didn't make the cut the first time, it would cost millions to go back, reassemble a production team to shoot live action, hope the actors are available, film the scenes, then go to ILM and have them rendered, and then all the post-production work to weave them in with existing shots - it's simply not economically feasible. You'be be remaking a big chunk of the movie, or making a large part of it from scratch. I don't see many movie studio's greenlighting something like that. Even the LOTRs Director's Cuts simply used footage and CGI that had been cut for time reasons. <br />
<br />
If Duncan doesn't have the shots to make the story bigger, than that's just what it is, unless he pays for the rendering and everything out of his own pocket (and the studio agrees to it). The extra scenes probably don't have transitional scenes to make them make sense, and give him material to work the flow with, because they didn't shoot them the first time. It's one the risks you take making CGI heavy films, unless you're George Lucas and own a production company like ILM, and full rights to the movies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those asking, no extended cut, that Im aware of. Lots of extra scenes on DVD though. There will be no directors cut. Just not possible.<br />
For those NOT asking, yes extended cut. It's possible because we planned ahead.</div></div><hr />
