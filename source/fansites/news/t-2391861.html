One of the new glaive models is actually a trilobite head.</div></div><hr />

Because it's not remastered yet, if they do that, the &quot;old&quot; graphics probably become free and in battlenet, like Starcraft 1.</div></div><hr />

*Trilobite mount*<br />
<br />
<br />
This messes with the lore! Why can't you make normal mounts?<br />
<br />
I think they look wonderful, and less &quot;busy&quot; than some of the other recent mounts.<br />
<br />
Also, huge props to the Classic team. Those people are the real MVPs. Would World of Warcraft Classic fall under their jurisdiction? Boy, I hope so.</div></div><hr />

Or an idea for a warglaive weapon skin, 2 Trilobite heads.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The pre-made chars you get on alpha and their gear optimization is pretty far from what your main will feel once BFA launches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And this comment is why we need character copy on the alpha. Much of the feedback they're getting about classes is largely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
(Not all of it, ofc.)</div></div><hr />

Armor penetration feral ahhh... those were the times...<br />

^ I actually enjoy it kind of in Legion, same with Balance (best it has been for me tbh), butboth of them really, really lose feel by removing the artifact and the traits. I think they've got good kits, except the basic rotation is well, really basic without them.<br />
<br />
Yeah, im really enjoying balance in legion. Full Moon's big dmg and Power of Goldrinn proc feel great, and when you activate incarnation + bloodlust you are a heavy hitting machine gun.</div></div><hr />

I don't mean this to be disrespectful, but how do you know? Neither you nor I am psychic and can predict the future. That's an assumption and speculation on you part, I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />

Because that’s how it’s always been with betas and the pre made chars. They are not optimized and geared very well and only give a rough picture. If we are able to transfers our own chars to the beta realms it’ll give a bette picture how the leveling process will feel. The feel of your character also change a lot during an expansion from the day you start to level and you start raiding for the example.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's true, but what I am getting at is the ENTIRE rotation of Kitty from MoP onward has just been terrible. It really needs to go back to WOTLK fun.</div></div><hr />
