Hurrdurr, it just makes it more exclusive. Some people have 200 mounts, some dont. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has to be some sort of error, as the nerf was from 20% to 10%, I find it incredibly hard to believe they're suddenly going to bump it *up* 10% from the pre-nerf value.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Especially since most other spell changes are simply tooltip corrections to reflect current hotfixes.</div></div><hr />

Nothing wrong with having something to work toward, over the course of the expansion. (or even the next)<br />
<br />
As for the reward of the achievement, I hope it's not just a recolored Sunreaver Dragonhawk.</div></div><hr />

Do me a favor, please point to the nerf? <br />
Raging blow no longer having an enraged requirement? Buff<br />
Execute damage increase? Buff<br />
Impending victory damage increase? Buff<br />

<br />
Even though we haven't seen the &quot;Armored Dragonhawk&quot; yet, I can already see a normal Dragonhawk with a different texture, with some armor plates on it or something.<br />
<br />
Blizzard should give the collectors something special, the 100 Mounts collected achievement gave something unique at the time, even though you could get a Dragonhawk from the Argent Tournament, but that was implemented some time later I think.</div></div><hr />

That's kind of the point. You're saying, ehhh getting into Harvard is a bit too much, you actually need good grades to get in in my opinion.<br />

It does seem to be a completely left-field mount choice though - it doesn't exactly seem to fit in with the other content (though, we know relatively little about 5.3, so who knows), and what with it's Level 20 and Apprentice Riding designation it looks most likely to be the next Blizz store mount.

Perhaps it is the alliance version of Bloodwing earned through achievement or something as there's no real reason Alliance would use bats as mounts, Faerie dragons are though commonly linked with Night Elves.</div></div><hr />

Please let it not be a store mount. Also why even a Dragonhawk?! The 100 mount ach was one as well.<br />
<br />
I dunno how the achievement is counted though. I'm close to 180 on most chars depending on class mounts, but on my armory I'm far over because it counts both horde and alliance mounts there.<br />
As for Tri spec.... THANK YOOOOOUUUUUUU Blizzard (this outburst of joy and appreciation is reserved under the condition it's actually true. No rights can be deducted from this assumption.)<br />
Although I figure it might be a costly new feature.</div></div><hr />

After 3 full ToT clears, I only have 7/20 of my legendary items for the quest and after this quest there's another one with (I think) 12 more items to get from bosses. It's going to take longer than a month even for someone that has killed every boss possible every week since 5.2 launched. It just seems too soon.<br />
<br />
If they launch 5.3 in a month or so, I really hope they don't launch 5.4 a month after that. A 13 boss raid has a longer lifetime than 2-3 months. Very few guilds will go 13/13H in only 2-3 months, probably only around 150 of them. I for one like some downtime in-between progression and farm content.</div></div><hr />

Honestly though, that is pretty good.<br />
<br />
The new models get better and better too. The wait on player models must be because they are going to be extremely well done.<br />
Considering they don't want to step on toes, making the new models have higher quality, but extremely similar animations is probably whats being done, but I'd bet some money that they are also going to add in some new flair to each one, even possibly given a new/old model/animation set choice.</div></div><hr />

No one need more than 1 spec, but people were too lazy to actually respec for whatever they did so blizz thought, &quot;hey it's soooooooooooooooooooo hard to go to a town and respec, let's make it easier with dual spec&quot;, however i really hope tri-spec is a cruel cruel april fool's joke.</div></div><hr />

Half of the sliced pizza I was just chewing came through my nose damnit :-D<br />

But yeah, I wish I could quote my post from years back when they added dualspec. Well, it went something like this.<br />
&quot;Blizzard will kneel in the end, and we'll end up having triplequadspec, just because.&quot;<br />
Sure I'll find this handy, but... This is becoming just more and more lazy &gt;_&gt; I guess 5.5 will hand out a new 350 slot backpack and new tabs will be added for: Tabards, Food, HS, Quest items, Profession items, Scrolls, Greens, Triplequadspec gear and whatnot.<br />
Just so that you can now farm greys for 6 hours straight without vendoring, and carry spirit totem, Spitting-plate, angry yak, heartmountainflower, chop-suey -set, petrocks and all the other &quot;Funstuff&quot; with you without running out of bagspace. Shieeet</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not just the spec that matters - respeccing is obviously easy enough already - but also the fact that it also saves your action bar/glyph/talent configuration itself. Having to go through all that every time you want to play your 'third' spec is a huge hassle and, for a lot of people, not worth it. <br />
<br />
True, they could just make it so you can change your spec like you do with talents, without the whole dual/tri-spec thing, but then we'd need some sort of built-in action bar saver which makes it all a lot more complicated than simply adding this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably why it's an &quot;Achievement&quot;, it's something you can work hard for by running dungeons over and over to hopefully get the mounts. I know lots of people who are to lazy and don't bother, but for us who put in the time and effort, it's nice to reap a little extra reward.<br />
<br />
This is the same attitude for anything in the game lately. &quot;Oh why must I do x, y and z to get something. I shouldn't have to try hard to get it. I don't have the time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't have the time or energy to be bothered? Play another game that meets your free time or maybe your life is so busy, a game is the last thing you should be playing?<br />
<br />
Also, the third spec. Why is it bad or good? I already on my main have a dps set, tank and healing. The only thing this does it make it so I don't have to move my buttons around on a spec every time I want to use the third one. This comes down to what I said above. How much effort are you going to put into getting the gear for those three specs? Don't have it? Use one spec and be happy. From what I see all this negative reaction is coming from people who don't have the time or want to bother with getting geared for all three. Well, it's not required you do so, and to be jealous of others that have is silly.<br />
<br />
The greed in this community is the factor making it not so fun to play at times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, anybody else getting the Blizzard store mount from the faerie dragon mount? It's so cute. :)<br />

Blind Wrathion is a pretty bad photoshop. Faerie dragon isn't much better. Robot and baby direhorn might be real but meh. And they started early with their jokes last year too.

Considering this it's not April fools day and this isn't how they normally do april fools jokes i dont think its a joke. Maybe they just decided, why limit people to 2 specs when people can just as easily respec at any point anyway.</div></div><hr />

They may or may not add a third talent spec, but it won't be because then &quot;everybody can do anything.&quot; Anyone can already play any of their three specs, via re-spec'ing.

<br />
<br />
Fairly confident they'll add it myself, its not like just because they're adding a third spec option you weren't able to be that spec before, you just can do it easier now, those that wanted to play a spec likely were already collecting gear.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, most people use there spec at the moment like this: PvE 1, PvE 2, alot of people are forced to have two specs for raiding to supplement fight requirements determined by the raid leader, this causes them to 'always' need to change one spec to be PvP oriented whenever they want to PvP.<br />
<br />
This change gives all of those people who need to have two specs for raiding fight requirements, a third spec to have for quick PvP swap. <br />
<br />
AKA<br />
Spec 1: PvE 1. <br />
Spec 2: PvE 2.<br />
Spec 3: PvP.</div></div><hr />

DBM is a third party addon. That was their prank, Blizzard had nothing to do with that. So again, Blizzard never does their pranks early. It's not april, everyone saying april fools needs to buy a friggen calendar. To the people saying it will cause loot nightmares, I'm guessing the lfr loot system will most likely be implemented in dungeons to stop people needing on everything for all specs. It's also coming just in time for their pick a spec function in lfr.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't matter, if they have the will to do it then they should be rewarded. However &quot;easy&quot; you might think it is (I am assuming you never did it yourself) or not, 200 mounts isnt something to sneeze at. That being said I think it is incredibly lazy of them to spit out a mount people got after collecting 100.

Why? Why is it &quot;sad&quot;? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shambulanced</div><div class="date">2013-03-25, 10:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">know that tri-spec is just datamined/loose info right now, but if it does indeed become a reality, what steps are being taken about inventory issues?<br />
<br />
We've had the same tired arguments on these (and the official) forums for years and years--literally since Vanilla, regarding inventory. It is universally agreed upon that the pet and mount tab were EXCELLENT solutions. The repeated blue answer is, &quot;Well, we know bigger bags aren't the solution.&quot; Okay. So what is? Every patch brings in new things--each tier brings in new armor and items. They gotta go somewhere. I don't think it's fun to spend months collecting old pieces of sets (in raids or otherwise, current or outdated) and have to ditch them because &quot;there's just no more room.&quot; That's not a fun decision for players to have to make.<br />
<br />
What of other things? Tabards? &quot;Toy&quot; items? Why are things still stacking at 20 when the demand is clearly bigger than that? Why do we only have one void storage tab?<br />
<br />
Tri-spec would be lovely, but it's only going to make inventory issues worse, not better, unless some changes FINALLY accompany it.<br />
<br />
If you want the easy band-aid fix, remove the new bag pattern from being Exalted with Golden Lotus (I mean, really. Come on.) and that will at least lessen the burden/expense of getting bigger bags to tide us over until some real change comes along.</div></div><hr />

Hell, I leveled up a second Priest just so I could have a PvP spec without having to compromise keybindings/layouts on my main. I'm super excited about tri-spec!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, some of us DO need more then one or two specs. I'm a warrior. My main spec is tank. My off spec is fury. Guess what? I want to pvp some to, best spec for it? Arms. I don't want to change out Fury just for arms to pvp when bored, have to reset ALL my bars and hotkeys ect. This is good for classes with 3 specs. ie: Druids/Monks/Paladins ect. This will for sure help those classes who want to dable in PvP every once in awhile and not have to constantly change a PvE spec.</div></div><hr />

Then your an idiot who should quit the game anyways, maybe should have already left. It doesn't effect you in any way, and is a quality of life change for those that NEED 3 specs to do what they want to do, what their guild needs them to do, or to experiment. ie: PvE/PvP specs.</div></div><hr />

It's never too soon. They have completely ignored Resto Shamans for 2 patches now even giving us nerfs (ex: You can't place down totems while silenced) While I do understand that Resto shamans are really good in PvP, they're lacking like crazy in PvE. Blizzard is trying to make Resto Shaman utility healers which is something we don't want to be. We want to be able to heal just as good as a Druid or Pally or even a damn Monk. I would rather Blizzard take away our Spirit Link Totem and buff all of our heals by 10% like they did with Resto Druids. On another note, they need to fix the Resto Shamans mastery and diminishing returns problem with it.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHAHAHA the whining here is so amusing. I love this. Quitting the game after 7 years because they're putting in a qol change that they're not even forcing you to use. Here's the thing. Nobody believes you're quitting. You are just whining for the sake of it. You think Blizzard or us is going to care that you're quitting. We don't. Well actually that's not true, I do care. I care because I would love for all the people like you to quit this game. Then maybe the forums wouldn't be filled with complaining over every little trivial thing. But like I said, you're not quitting, you're just a joke. On April 1st you'll be relevant.</div></div><hr />

It sounds too good to be true, so it might be an april fool's joke, but then again Blizzard usually has funny april fool's jokes, not mean ones, and seeing as how so many people have been asking for tri-spec, this would definetly be a cruel joke. Blizzard has also started early in the past with their jokes, but an entire week? I highly doubt it. Plus theres no funny or obscure tooltips, which are usually a sign it's a joke.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the Faerie Dragon is definitely not a joke. There are 4 or 5 different skins for the dragon, and some look like they had a great deal of time spent on them. This would be a pretty expensive joke then, and pretty elaborate seeing as how all of the skins are currently on the PTR. So if this is a joke, then obviously Blizzard has more money than they know what to do with. Also, don't forget the bat mounts that were datamined for 5.2. I believe there were the same amount of recolors for that mount as there are for this mount, which means the bat mount would be the Horde counterpart for the faerie dragon.<br />

Nah I think whiny complainers throwing the word, &quot;fanboy&quot; around is much more annoying. I play the game, I'm a fan of it. There is nothing to defend here. Trispec is not something to quit over. That's just sad. He isn't even giving any reasoning. He posted that garbage on the battlenet forums too and when people laughed and asked him to actually elaborate he ignored it. That's because he has no reason. There is no reason to complain about it, none. It doesn't screw his gameplay up having other people be able to switch specs without having to arrange their bars. He's just complaining for the sake of complaining. He's like a real life Francis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can haz ur stuff? <br />
<br />
Seriously though, people are already doing the tri-spec thing now but the process includes a lot of wasted time. On my raid team, due to our specific composition, I sometimes have to switch between tanking, healing, and DPS during the course of a raid. This requires a trip to the city, re-talenting, re-glyphing, and re-configuring my talent bars (not to mention having three raid-ready gear sets on hand). I enjoy the people I'm running with, and I'd rather not have to call the raid because we don't have three healers or I can't switch to DPS for a specific encounter.<br />
<br />
Same argument goes for people wanting to try something new. I think tri-spec would lead to more tanks, more healers, more PvPers, etc. because it would remove one of the barriers to entry. Don't forget - you'd still have to learn to play that specific role and you'd still need the proper gear, limitations that should dampen any rampant spec-switching (as if that was a bad thing). But, having the spec ready to go (without the trainer, glyph, talent, &amp; bar reconfiguration slog) may prompt people to branch out their gameplay experience.<br />
<br />
Your earlier posts make it sound like people would be switching roles between trash packs. I think this line of reasoning is suspect - how many dungeon runs have you been on where you have wanted, much less needed, to change specs on trash? Blizzard could easily implement a restriction on spec switching in dungeons, BGs, etc. if they wanted to - but I really don't think tri-spec is the death knell for WoW. If anything, I think it'll lead to more activity and participation in various aspects of the game.</div></div><hr />

And I'm sure other classes would find it useful as well.</div></div><hr />

If it doesn't affect me, I would never be angry about it. If it does, but it's an option, I would never be angry about it. You can call it &quot;defensive mantra [...] chanted for years&quot;, but I most certainly hold true to it. It's how everyone should treat everything in life. If it doesn't affect you, why bother?</div></div><hr />

Because whiners who cry about every QoL change in the game that really have no effect on them are so much better? Give me a break. The person he was responding to made a long drawn out forum post on the official forums stating he had played since vanilla when he barely had any achievement points, or experience in the game as a whole. Another idiot who sees himself as hardcore and complains about casuals dumbing down the game when he himself refuses to go out and experience the actual hard content. Btw that person said he isn't quitting he is going to level a 70 and raid old content. Because apparently doing level 70 raids with the crazy scaling that 3 expansions has brought is so much more challenging than current content. Yea he knows what he is talking about.</div></div><hr />

I'd imagine that either the Kor'kron stuff be somewhat plentiful with the Radical Mojo being harder to get, or vice versa.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I'm a hunter as well. Marksmanship is our best soloing spec but I never play MM outside of soloing so it will be nice to actually have that spec around instead of running into a fight I can't do as BM or SV so I run alllll the way back to Org to respec, do the fight, then come back to Org again to get my real spec for raid. Tri-spec needed to be in the game.</div></div><hr />

The lightning ore for engineers was to be used for new 5.2 stuff. (See here (http://www.wowdb.com/items/recipes/engineering?filter-patch=16408))<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, all the new engineering stuff got pulled shortly before 5.2 went live. I know that for Pierre the reason was that a last-minute bug had reared its head, but the others... I couldn't tell you. I have heard, though, that the schematics that were supposed to be in 5.2 are planned to be introduced in 5.3. (Don't take it as gospel until it's officially confirmed, by the way.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing that Bad Robot Productions may get involved in the upcoming Warcraft movie.</div></div><hr />
