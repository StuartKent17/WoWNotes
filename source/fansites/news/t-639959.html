Blizzard just posted a new UI Add-On development policy, this probably means the end of paid versions of popular addons such as Carbonite (http://www.carboniteaddon.com/default.aspx). <br />
[b]World of Warcraft User Interface Add-On Development Policy<br />
With the continuing popularity of World of Warcraft user interface add-ons (referred to hereafter as &quot;add-ons&quot;) created by the community of players, Blizzard Entertainment has formalized design and distribution guidelines for add-ons. These guidelines have been put in place to ensure the integrity of World of Warcraft and to help promote an enjoyable gaming environment for all of our players - failure to abide by them may result in measures up to and including taking formal legal action.<br />
<br />
1) Add-ons must be free of charge.<br />
All add-ons must be distributed free of charge. Developers may not create &quot;premium&quot; versions of add-ons with additional for-pay features, charge money to download an add-on, charge for services related to the add-on, or otherwise require some form of monetary compensation to download or access an add-on.<br />
<br />
2) Add-on code must be completely visible.<br />
The programming code of an add-on must in no way be hidden or obfuscated, and must be freely accessible to and viewable by the general public.<br />
<br />
3) Add-ons must not negatively impact World of Warcraft realms or other players.<br />
Add-ons will perform no function which, in Blizzard Entertainment's sole discretion, negatively impacts the performance of the World of Warcraft realms or otherwise negatively affects the game for other players. For example, this includes but is not limited to excessive use of the chat system, unnecessary loading from the hard disk, and slow frame rates.<br />
<br />
4) Add-ons may not include advertisements.<br />
Add-ons may not be used to advertise any goods or services.<br />
<br />
5) Add-ons may not solicit donations.<br />
Add-ons may not include requests for donations. We recognize the immense amount of effort and resources that go into developing an add-on; however, such requests should be limited to the add-on website or distribution site and should not appear in the game.<br />
<br />
6) Add-ons must not contain offensive or objectionable material.<br />
World of Warcraft has been given a &quot;T&quot; by the ESRB, and similar ratings from other ratings boards around the world. Blizzard Entertainment requires that add-ons not include any material that would not be allowed under these ratings.<br />
<br />
7) Add-ons must abide by World of Warcraft ToU and EULA.<br />
All add-ons must follow the World of Warcraft Terms of Use and the World of Warcraft End User License Agreement.<br />
<br />
8 ) Blizzard Entertainment has the right to disable add-on functionality as it sees fit.<br />
To maintain the integrity World of Warcraft and ensure the best possible gaming experience for our players, Blizzard Entertainment reserves the right to disable any add-on functionality within World of Warcraft at its sole discretion. For more information...<br />
<br />
If you are an add-on developer and have any questions about and this User Interface Add-On Development Policy and how it pertains to the add-on that you've developed, please don't hesitate to email us at <br />

You obviously have no idea of the concept of intellectual property. Simply put, companies take a dim view of other people making money off their intellectual property. It can and will erode their copyright protections and brand image. Addons are not different from books, cards, movies, etc. in this regard.</div></div><hr />

yeah, that point doesn't mean the end of paid versions. It's point number one that ends paid versions.<br />
<br />
It seems they dont mind them accepting donations. The problem that point 5 seems to address is that add-ons cant give you any messages that they would like donations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. From Blizzard's point of view its really no different than what gold sellers are doing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aetheron</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 02:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I'm concerned that this might be the end of Auctioneer. Specifically because of this line:<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Add-ons must not negatively impact World of Warcraft realms or other players.<br />
Add-ons will perform no function which, in Blizzard Entertainment's sole discretion, negatively impacts the performance of the World of Warcraft realms or otherwise negatively affects the game for other players. For example, this includes but is not limited to excessive use of the chat system, unnecessary loading from the hard disk, and slow frame rates.<br />
<br />
That is extremely vague wording, but (without knowing exactly how the scanning process works for Auctioneer) I can imagine if you have 300 people &quot;scanning&quot; the AH at the same time it could affect performance. Not to mention the auto-list and search features provided could be seen, at &quot;Blizzard's Discretion&quot;, as basically a cheat to the economy.<br />
<br />
As for Carbonite... I had wondered how long it would be until Blizzard stepped up and banned it. don't get me wrong, great set of addons - but I can get the same thing through free ones, of equal or better (imo) quality.<br />
<br />
As the person above me pointed out, if you are an addon creator at www.myaddonforwow.com, you can have something that says &quot;Please help support me by donating money! This will in no way affect your copy of my addon or give you special features&quot; on your website. But you can't put it into the loading messages of the game. Paid version of carbonite simply can't happen, per bullet point 1 - You are not allowed to charge for any portion of the addon. ie - if you have to pay to download or unlock a &quot;full&quot; addon, it's now against the EULA/TOS/whatever they have for addons.</div></div><hr />

I really don't think Blizzard is trying to stamp out Auctioneer, I think they're going after the nude mods and the hax add-ons.</div></div><hr />

I will probably be looking for a new ui now, no biggie I can just go back to the ones I using before. I like the new rules, because I don't like seeing the spam when I log on. I don't mind donating a bit to help out, cause I know some of these addons can be a lot of work, but I can see Blizzard's view pt too.</div></div><hr />

The add-on itself is the intellectual property of author as soon as the author writes it, not Blizzard. Wouldn't that give said author the right to distribute it however it sees fit? The add-on is plain text, it's not like it's some sort of binary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard can do whatever they so please, since World of Warcraft is THEIR intellectual property. They decide what is allowed to be run on their IP, how it is run etc.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Let me clarify: World of Warcraft and all it's contents belong to Blizzard Entertainment. Addons, regardless of how wonderful they might be, are technically all &quot;guests&quot; that use World of Warcraft as a base of operations. One could say, Blizzard is acting in this regard as a land lord, and thus allowed to decide whatever they see fit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm referring to the legal action against add-ons that require payment. World of Warcraft is their property, the add-on is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We don't need any of the add-on authors who find it necessary to get compensated for their work. I'm not saying their work isn't great, but I am saying they're expendable; there are always others who will come along and take their place, and do it for free.<br />
<br />
I personally am glad that Blizzard has put a stop to this now. There's absolutely no reason not to keep the add-on world free of charge. The argument that getting compensated will result in better add-ons is complete and utter BS.<br />
<br />
Often those who are trying to make a buck with their product shove it out unfinished and cut corners to get more for less work, whereas those who are doing it for the love of doing it will most often end up perfecting it as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Also, quite often the case is - especially in the world of computer software and games - that someone creates a product for free, then shares it, then realizes it has become popular and thousands, even millions of people have downloaded it and are using it, and it is then when the dollar sign pops up, and even though they could just walk away, happy, having created a great product for free, they decide to make a new version as shareware, or one that only has a trial version.<br />
<br />
Greed. Pure and simple.</div></div><hr />

Basically Blizzard is putting in some general rules that reminds of the GNU project, which is very much made of win in my eyes.<br />
<br />
The community of WoW have also become to large to let others earn money on Blizzards work, it's understandable with this act.<br />
<br />
And it'll improve the overall amount of add-ons and help future developers.<br />
<br />
It's amazingly easy to bug fix a already made add-on. I'm looking forward to a non-obfuscated version of Carbonite with no ads :) So I can remove the splash screen and perhaps do a integration to the mini-map.</div></div><hr />

You act like it has never been done before. Blizzard HAS recoded addon script language to disable specific addons from working. If you've played from the dawn of servers coming live post retail you would have noticed many downfalls of popular addons that were &quot;too powerful&quot; such as the old school Decursive. I even remember using an addon that with one button press would run my character wherever I needed, unattended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Common sense, do you have it?<br />
<br />
To unlock the full features of Carbonite, you had to pay for it. This wasn't the authors of Carbonite saying &quot;please donate&quot;, &quot;please help&quot; it was &quot;you'll either pay, or you don't get to use the full addon, too bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
Re-read the donation lines carefully. The author of Carbonite is free to ask for donations on his site. He is not however, free to ask for donations in game, via the mod. <br />
<br />
You need to learn the difference between advertising, and in-game advertising. Research and read before throwing a tantrum please.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Add-ons may not include advertisements.<br />
Add-ons may not be used to advertise any goods or services.<br />
<br />
5) Add-ons may not solicit donations.<br />
Add-ons may not include requests for donations. We recognize the immense amount of effort and resources that go into developing an add-on; however, such requests should be limited to the add-on website or distribution site and should not appear in the game. <br />

<br />
Apples and Oranges. And I can't believe you're grasping this hard to make a point.<br />
<br />
A leveling guide is a guide. An interpretation. An efficient way of doing something.<br />
<br />
An addon is similar, except it's using Blizzards property to do it's function. The only thing doing any sort of function while reading, or using a guide, is using your head. Blizzard cannot sue you for this.</div></div><hr />

How are they gonna remove already existing addons usage in the game?<br />
<br />
But i understand that they dont want &quot;donate please&quot; and Ads around addons.<br />
<br />
<br />
A friendly cease + desist letter is all Blizz will need to stop people from selling add ons or doing any in-game advertising. <br />
<br />
I think its less likely they'll actually do anything about add ons that contain &quot;offensive&quot; material. Just like in the game itself, its an extremely difficult thing for Blizzard to actually regulate. If anything, add on portals might crack down on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No it doesn't.<br />
<br />
The key part of that paragraph you linked is that you can not charge people to download or access an addon.<br />
<br />
The new curse client's premium/subscriber service is when it's installing the addons. In the premium vesion you'll get a one button update service . In the free version you'll see a button for each addon that has an updated version for it. You click on the button next to the addon to download that addon.<br />
<br />
In no way shape or form does the free version prevent you from downloading or acessing an addon it just takes a little longer thats all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">K21Nova</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 04:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">it just takes a little longer<br />

Well...<br />
<br />
<br />
...charge for services related to the add-on...<br />
<br />
...providing an add-on faster, or easier, is a service related to the add-on. Hence, Blizzard does not like.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nazrakin</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 05:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No it isn't<br />

<br />
<br />
It clearly states that you cannot charge for services related to the add on. The curse downloader is an add on related service. As I said, its vague enough that Blizzard could certainly go after them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bluspacecow</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">...providing an add-on faster, or easier, is a service related to the add-on. Hence, Blizzard does not like.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the spirit is they don't like charging to download the addon prevent you from downloading an addon.<br />
<br />
Let's look at that policy again shall we ?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All add-ons must be distributed free of charge. Developers may not create &quot;premium&quot; versions of add-ons with additional for-pay features, charge money to download an add-on, charge for services related to the add-on, or otherwise require some form of monetary compensation to download or access an add-on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Distributed free of charge ? <br />
<br />
Check!<br />
<br />
Addons with additional for pay features ? <br />
<br />
None !<br />
<br />
Charge money to download an addon ? <br />
<br />
Nope not charging for people to click a button to download the addon<br />
<br />
Charge for services related to the addon ? <br />
<br />
Yeah this will need some clarification. Especially since technically this could cover advertisements on addon sites . Will this mean addon sites will now have to close ?. Don't worry tho Kaelten's asking Blizzard for some clarification<br />
<br />
otherwise require some form of monetary compensation to download or access an add-on?<br />
<br />
Nope. They're not charging people to click a button to download an addon. It's just more buttons so hence takes longer.<br />
<br />
IMHO i don't see anything in there about make it slower or harder to download an addon being bad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bluspacecow</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 05:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It clearly states that you cannot charge for services related to the add on. The curse downloader is an add on related service. As I said, its vague enough that Blizzard could certainly go after them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is exactly why Kaelten's asking Blizzard for a little clarification.<br />
<br />
Because it's vauge enough to also include page advertisements on addon sites.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rangerfox</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 05:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So does this mean that Zygor can no longer charge for his in-game leveling guide add-on?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">theKarn</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 05:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">1) Add-ons must be free of charge.<br />
All add-ons must be distributed free of charge. Developers may not create &quot;premium&quot; versions of add-ons with additional for-pay features, charge money to download an add-on, charge for services related to the add-on, or otherwise require some form of monetary compensation to download or access an add-on.<br />
<br />
<br />
that's a bitch move blizz. although my addon is free of charge knowing i can't, one day, if i wanted, charge for something I worked hard on is kinda bullshit.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Add-on code must be completely visible.<br />
The programming code of an add-on must in no way be hidden or obfuscated, and must be freely accessible to and viewable by the general public.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why? So they can make sure it contains no malicious coding? Because we've had so many problems with people getting keylogged by actually lua files, right?<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Add-ons must not negatively impact World of Warcraft realms or other players.<br />
Add-ons will perform no function which, in Blizzard Entertainment's sole discretion, negatively impacts the performance of the World of Warcraft realms or otherwise negatively affects the game for other players. For example, this includes but is not limited to excessive use of the chat system, unnecessary loading from the hard disk, and slow frame rates.<br />
<br />
<br />
good rule. I support it to the fullest.<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Add-ons may not include advertisements.<br />
Add-ons may not be used to advertise any goods or services.<br />
<br />
<br />
I support this too. Ads have no place in this game.<br />
<br />
<br />
5) Add-ons may not solicit donations.<br />
Add-ons may not include requests for donations. We recognize the immense amount of effort and resources that go into developing an add-on; however, such requests should be limited to the add-on website or distribution site and should not appear in the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
I recognize donation requests in addons are fine as long as they aren't annoying. If they are limited to a small pertain of the main box i don't see the problem but i'll let this one slide.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
6) Add-ons must not contain offensive or objectionable material.<br />
World of Warcraft has been given a &quot;T&quot; by the ESRB, and similar ratings from other ratings boards around the world. Blizzard Entertainment requires that add-ons not include any material that would not be allowed under these ratings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good rule.<br />
<br />
<br />
7) Add-ons must abide by World of Warcraft ToU and EULA.<br />
All add-ons must follow the World of Warcraft Terms of Use and the World of Warcraft End User License Agreement.<br />
<br />
Wait I can make addons that are against the ToU and EULA? Since when? Sounds like this one is just to cover your own butt if something goes wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
8 ) Blizzard Entertainment has the right to disable add-on functionality as it sees fit.<br />
To maintain the integrity World of Warcraft and ensure the best possible gaming experience for our players, Blizzard Entertainment reserves the right to disable any add-on functionality within World of Warcraft at its sole discretion. <br />
<br />
Didn't they do this already?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peewheewoo</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 05:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So does that mean that I can sue Blizzard for all the stealing of my intellectual properties now as everyone who likes my addons steals the code and adds it to their UIs?<br />
<br />
With the 'wide open' concept, all the code is there ready for anyone to do with as they wish. Even stuff, that I've written and have ownership of.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS..No I don't have addons but just throwing this out there as everyone is bringing up the looseness of the language of the agreements.<br />
<br />
Personally I see nothing wrong with Carbonite. Sure yes I can download 15 different addons and almost do the same thing, but none of those addons are updated a few times a month if any. It makes the game more enjoyable knowing that my addon 'suite' is going to work when I log in and if it suddenly gets broken, in a day if that it will be fixed. Now with this development policy, blizzard is saying that you cant hold ownership on any code you write for an addon, and everything becomes public domain..Umm, sorry that isnt right.</div></div><hr />

If you ask Kaelten, I'm sure he disagree. Opposite to common belief, bandwidth is not free.<br />
<br />
What Blizzard is trying to prevent is major add-on authors like Carbonite to profit on add-ons.<br />
<br />
And to bring more developers in though the &quot;open source&quot; spirit, by banning obfuscated code.</div></div><hr />

They've done your first suggestion before when they removed the ability for a script to act in your stead without a button click, such as autocleansing, and they can do it again.<br />
<br />
If they can't do so without breaking something that they want to keep in the game functionality, then they can just as easily announce that, due to noncompliance with the rules, the use of X addon is now a bannable offense, and since they know exactly what addons you use, they can easily track down those who are using them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? So they can make sure it contains no malicious coding? Because we've had so many problems with people getting keylogged by actually lua files, right?No, so others can maintain and renew otherwise obsolete/abandoned code. And to help new authors learn from other add-ons. <br />

The rule is only about visual content. You're free to advertise your website and ask for donations in the source code.<br />
<br />

Wait I can make addons that are against the ToU and EULA? Since when? Sounds like this one is just to cover your own butt if something goes wrong.You didn't play in WoW:Classic I can guess. Cosmos had issues that was close to breaking the ToU several times.<br />
<br />
There have also been developed a add-on that changed the GM Help Frame with help of a separate application and some memory hooks. Which allowed in-game browsing. That's clearly against the rules.<br />
<br />
It's mostly to cover their own ass, yes, as the current 'de facto rules' are: &quot;if it's doable with the available API, it's legit&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />

I started in 1.10. Cosmos came CLOSE to breaking the ToU, but they never truely broke it. W/e they did was surely fixed quickly along with decurse/cleanse being put on the GCD to fix that addon exploit.<br />
<br />
<br />
The last paragraph is just a legal statement. It's not relevant for regular users.<br />
<br />
No, it means they can deny use of any addon, helpful or not, depending on how they feel that day. I know blizzard has only went after things that have a negitive impact of the game but who's to say the will not go after Bartender because it modifies the visual experiance of the game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I get where you are coming from, but I believe that is why Blizzard said nothing about people taking donations still.<br />
<br />
In the sense of charging for people to use your add-on(i know yours is free, saying it for general purposes) then you would be making money off their program. Yeah you wrote the code for the add on, but without the game, add-ons dont really amount to much.</div></div><hr />

Simply put, companies take a dim view of other people making money off their intellectual property. It can and will erode their copyright protections and brand image. Addons are not different from books, cards, movies, etc. in this regard.<br />
<br />
While, I like the idea of all add-ons beings free... I think this kinda sucks. I mean what's the difference between an add-on that enhances the features and user experience of a game versus something like McAfee anti-virus for Windows or RegCleaner? These softwares don't work independently from Windows, they enhance the user experience of Windows.<br />
<br />
Of course Microsoft allows software development like this for their product, whereas Blizzard doesn't.<br />
<br />
Anyway, maybe Blizzard needs to host their own addons site, put up ads, and share profits with the developers like Google shares profits with YouTube contributors.<br />
<br />
Additionally, it would help Blizzard's image if when they blatently copy and integrate an addon into the game themselves that they reward the developer in some way... maybe through a monthly addon contest with a cash prize.</div></div><hr />

Think of it this way:<br />
<br />
The Blizzard UI API is a bunch of Chimps, each capable of doing certain things when told how to.<br />
You are a Chimp Trainer, capable of telling the Chimps what you want done.<br />
<br />
You can write whatever kind of cool and unique scenarios (addons) you want to get those Chimps to jump through their hoops, or balance balls on their heads, or throw feces at gold farmers, but at the end of the day, BLIZZARD OWNS THE CHIMPS, and you are considered to have entered into an agreement with them in order to have been allowed access to knowledge of what instructions those Chimps will follow.<br />
<br />
Your scripted scenarios are yours, but they are still useless without the Chimps, and BLIZZARD OWNS THE CHIMPS.</div></div><hr />

You are very much incorrect. Interfacing with an API does *not* transfer intellectual property rights. It's quite the opposite, it grants an implied license. <br />
<br />
The difference is that before this announcement, there were no restrictions on that license. Now there are. They won't ever own the code, but they can take action against you if you operate outside of their licensing rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's between them and whoever they licensed it from. <br />
<br />
Regardless, no court is going to take any company seriously that purposely provides hooks into their client for people to use, and then turns around and sues people for actually using them, especially with no rules in place. Now that they actually do have rules in place, there will be actionable items, but Blizzard won't be trying to claim copyright on code. Worst case scenario for a developer is a cease and desist letter, at which point you better cease and desist, or else know a really good lawyer. <br />
<br />
And blizzard is not forbidding donation support, they're simply preventing advertising within the game. You can troll for donations on your website as much as you want, as long as you don't ask for donations in the mod itself, and as long as you don't have to 'donate' to be able to get ahold of the mod (because at that point it's not a donation, it's a purchase). The grey area is whether or not the author putting their websites address in the mod would be considered advertising. I think a valid arguement could be made that listing a website is listing contact information, not an advertisement</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Constructive</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People have really weird ideas about what intellectual property is.<br />
<br />
Copyright law gives the right to exclusively decide who gets to copy, distribute, sell and transmit to the public, the code that you own. As long as the add-on developer is not copying Blizzard code, then copyright is not relevant here. Do you also think that Microsoft gets to decide who makes windows-compatible programs?<br />
<br />
Trademark law does give Blizzard the right to sue commercial users who exploit their name and marks. So this could be relevant. But even then, you can't use trademark law to stop someone from informing their customer about what their products is compatible with. Imagine a car-manufacturer trying to ban a third-party component manufacturer from advertising that their product works together with the car. Not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Patent law. As far as I know, Blizzard hasn't patented their code.<br />
<br />
At most Blizzard can use the ToS to ban the users of these add-ons, but they can't stop the developers directly. This is just a wish-list from Blizzard, only with with legal smokescreens and bad attitude.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Copyright law gives the right to exclusively decide who gets to copy, distribute, sell and transmit to the public, the code that you own. As long as the add-on developer is not copying Blizzard code, then copyright is not relevant here. Do you also think that Microsoft gets to decide who makes windows-compatible programs?<br />
<br />
Trademark law does give Blizzard the right to sue commercial users who exploit their name and marks. So this could be relevant. But even then, you can't use trademark law to stop someone from informing their customer about what their products is compatible with. Imagine a car-manufacturer trying to ban a third-party component manufacturer from advertising that their product works together with the car. Not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Patent law. As far as I know, Blizzard hasn't patented their code.<br />
<br />
At most Blizzard can use the ToS to ban the users of these add-ons, but they can't stop the developers directly. This is just a wish-list from Blizzard, only with with legal smokescreens and bad attitude.<br />
I think you are missing something here. You can't compare windows with a video game. Blizzard has the right to outright ban everything that they think will make the video game or more importantly &quot;the performance&quot; of the video game suffer. When you use windows you are not using Microsoft's bandwith and servers with every little thing you do. If that would be the case then I am sure Microsoft would also put restrictions. But even then Windows and WoW are two very different things you can't even start to compare them.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has to put an effort into defending it's intellectual property since if Blizzard allows too many commercial companies to take benefit of their product they will in the end lose their intellectual property, Just look up Aspirin for a lesson in the history books.<br />
<br />
It's more than a wishlist. Blizzard is by no means obligated to allow add-ons. It's something they allow as a community stimulation, but they can just as easy prohibit all 3rd party add-ons when they feel like it. That is something a lot of people tend to forget.</div></div><hr />

I do believe Blizzard can ban you from any service for any reason or no reason at all. That isn't the problem here. The problem is that they are legislating terms of use to developers that are not legally bound to agree to them. This is exactly analogous to Microsoft dictating how programs utilizing something like the .NET framework are distributed. Yes they invented the platform and the API, but they have no legal right telling you how to distribute it. That is up to state and federal laws.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard attempts to enforce this new TOU in the court system, it will be almost as egregious as their court case against Glider in which an incompetent judge ruled that WOW DATA IN RAM IS COPYRIGHTED.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I think it is the end of Carbonite unless they find some other way... like making standalone not WoW dependant stuff you can buy and make Carbonite &quot;free&quot; addon to optionally use that to access more utility (like some additional data). There must be some way to do it.<br />
<br />
Also it might have been nice from Blizz' side to tell to these developers maybe month or two before actual policy change, so devs can find some other source of income.<br />
<br />
I am not an addon dev, but I really like Carbonite. I don't mind if its free, sure, but I don't think devs are going to continue developing it.<br />
<br />
So many things is happening in wow and I disagree with more and more. It's just making me sad. You know there are always other ways how to spend time then playing wow (like playing another mmorpg, lol).</div></div><hr />

If anyone is interested there is a Computer Games magazine in the UK called Edge (issue 200) which has a piece on the whole Glider ruling and its implications.<br />

This thread was full of so much cluelessness until you posted. Thanks.<br />
<br />
The people here who think Blizzard has some rights to addon code must also think that Microsoft has some right to the code of any program that runs under Windows? Or that Sony has some claim over the code of any game that runs on the PS3? No. <br />
<br />
Most likely the only thing they can do if someone violates these &quot;guidelines&quot; is to threaten a suit, which they'd probably lose if they actually filed, but what addon author is going to actually want to fight that battle? Probably none. So that's that.<br />
<br />
Of course they can ban users who use an unapproved addon, but that has nothing to do with the actual addon author or its development or ownership.<br />
<br />
And about Glider...it was found to have violated the DMCA because it circumvents the normal checks that WoW's &quot;warden&quot; performs for that kind of program. Certainly something like asking for money for an addon doesn't violate the DMCA.</div></div><hr />

WoW isn't just a piece of software like Windows, it basically is an online platform. Don't compare WoW to Windows but rather to Amazon, Ebay or Salesforce.<br />
<br />
This gives Blizzard much more control over who may use their platform and how it may be used. Blizzard should have no legal problems enforcing those parts of 1) and 2) that affect addons.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if they can prohibit stuff like the Curse Downloader. At least for me it is obvious that they intend to do so, but such products do not use Blizzard's platform or API in any way. So they might be beyond their reach - but I'm no lawyer (and even for those online platforms might be something new).</div></div><hr />

Not really. For the purposes of addons, WoW is a LUA interpreter with an API, that LUA scripts run under. Besides, if you want to look at it like eBay, it doesn't really change anything - eBay wouldn't have any claims to the code of a third-party package that accessed its website in some kind of automated manner. Sure, they could attempt to ban use of the package by changing their website or banning the users who use it...the same options Blizzard has.</div></div><hr />

Something along the lines of the way Microsoft/Sony ensure that only validly licensed games run on their consoles, or the way that Windows tells you when a new driver or program you're installing isn't properly &quot;signed&quot;.

<br />
Ummm, No.<br />
<br />
Running games or software doesn't affect how much you pay for your ps3 or windows. Running an addon, however, affects the performance of the game which is entirely what blizzard charges you on.Windows &amp; PS3 is designed so that 3rd party programs &amp; games could run on it. Wow is designed so you can play one of the 16 races and 8 class, not so you can run an addon.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, Windows &amp; PS3 is doing business by selling you their product.Their product which you purchase is final. Whatever you do to the product has nothing to do with them since you paid them already. <br />
<br />
Blizz (online portion) is selling you a service. They don't gain from an addon that makes your wow experience better. (Think about it. Who would quit a game for one fking addon?) Furthermore, benefiting monetarily through the use of blizz's service without the consent of the the service provider is definitely illegal. Your addon runs on the service of blizz(Wow), therefore you are using their service.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suggest you read up on the Glider ruling<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard argued, and Judge Campbell agreed, that when users violated the World of Warcraft EULA, they no longer had a license to play the game and were therefore guilty of copyright infringement. As Siy noted in a blog post last year, Blizzard's theory, if taken literally, would mean that violating any of the rules in the EULA and Terms of Service, such as choosing a screen name that didn't meet Blizzard's guidelines, would be an act of copyright infringement <br />

Preach some sense into these people. No matter what you feel about people trying to sell addons (the code THEY put time and energy into developing and is totally legal by actual laws) you need to look at the big picture people. Who the hell thinks they could actually uphold this in a court is delusional at best. <br />
<br />
I for one hope to see more paid-for-addons. If you dont want to buy them, dont buy them. If you do, enjoy. Trying to screw with capitalism. Doesn't hurt their bottemline IN ANY WAY YOU CAN POSSIBLY COME UP WITH. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SimTex</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 11:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow many blizzard fan boys in this thread. <br />
<br />
How many of you havn't whined or at least been irritated when you couldnt get your favorite addon updated after a major content patch because the addons sites were down. Consider how much bandwidth 11 million players potentially use. These rules basically tells all those site you can't charge shit for the service your provide or you risk legal action. (Not that I think Blizzard will ever win, and if that is the case the servers would just be moved to Rusland or another country with less strict rules.) <br />
<br />
Secondly addons like carbonite, questhelper what ever, are not mandatory to play the game. If you like them pay for them, if blizzard don't like them, they can remove their abiliity to pull information from your quest log, and the addons would be gone (or had to rely on memory sniffing, which didn't work for glider), there is no reason to deny payment for addons just because blizzard don't like that kind of addons. <br />
<br />
Allowing ingame adds for payment, ofc this should be allowed, the creator of the addon decides what he puts in his addon, and if he wants to have an oppotunity to earn something from making an adddon let him. (AGAIN YOUR ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO USE HIS ADDONS IF YOU DONT LIKE THE IDEA OF ADDS, hell you can even modify his code to remove it). Saying he can just put a paypal button on his site, is infeasible, because how many addons are actually downloaded from the authors own site. (Here I assume that these new rules are a result of that type of addons)<br />
<br />
Finally blizzard made this addon system so people could make the game better, until now it has worked in their favour, and I seriously don't see any reason to enforce these new rules, I havn't encounter any problems with addons. Back in vanilla wow, there were addons that could do a little too much, and those were forced out by changes to the addon API. I also remember that blizzard changed how /who worked to get avoid performance bottlenecks caused by census. Also the API for pulling data from the auction house was changed when the popularity of Auctioneer increased. So if blizzard have a problem with quest helping addons, they should just fix thier API, and not try to force all addon developers and addon sites to obey a new set of rules. <br />
<br />
And to people saying that this is good so that sites like curse can stop earning money on Wow. What do you think that sites like mmo-champion, wowhead or wowinsider is about. It's all about making money from wow, just because their service as it is now is free, doesnt mean that they don't try to earn something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have yet to pay for any addons. The TOU doesn't specify that I can't use paid-for addons. I support the right of the developers to sell their work. I don't support Blizzard's policy of controlling third party developer copyright (which is legally unenforceable). Besides that, how exactly would they disable addons? I could rename them, modify their hashes, rewrite them as my own. The only way to completely control the content of addons would be to disable all output functions in the API or require digital signatures/officially approved addons. Either way wouldn't go over well with the player base or the developers.<br />

<br />
<br />
It is my personal belief that the judge that presided over that case was incompetent in the realm of technology. The fact that I could be infringing copyright simply by having data in my RAM and possibly copying or modifying it is ridiculous. Not to mention these new terms of use are in fact a violation of developer copyright if Blizzard attempts to enforce them, and they really only have standing if their intellectual property rights or trademark is being infringed upon.</div></div><hr />

Thus, you'd be paying for a non functional addon.<br />

<br />
So?<br />
<br />
Blizzard is fully withing their rites to disable addon functionality as they see fit<br />
<br />
They are NOT, however, within any rites to tell people what they can or cannot do with addons. They can tell people what they want them to do, but they have zero legal backing. You cant be a company and just toss up a list of shit you want to happen and expect the law to back you. <br />

It does not, because they would be infringing on the developers' copyrights. They can control what happens within the realm of wow, not what happens outside it. As long as it doesn't infringe on trademark, IP, or Blizzard's copyright, and is not taking place within any of their other services.</div></div><hr />

They own the game, and the servers. <br />

They do not own the addons nor the code, nor do they have legal premise to do anything about said addons due to them not infringing copywrite in any arguable way like Glider was. <br />

Even if their was legal premise in the Glider case, it would be moot because the case is going to appeals court, so nothing is even final. Your half assed argument fails.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly why Glider is in hot water (yet still undetermined) and things like addons cannot be enforced in any other way but Blizzard yanking code on their end to stop it. <br />

You people that think they can take people to court over addons are amazingly out of touch with reality. Even trying to compare it somehow to Glider to further your 'arguments' shows a gaping hole in your understanding of the legal system and morality general.

If they find software or addons which negatively impact the game, they can deny it the ability to function with the game.<br />

Given enough money, a defendant could win a case against Blizzard. However, I know that's not the reality. Most developers that are affected by this will receive a cease and desist notice and summarily stop charging for their addon or stop working on it altogether.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen anybody in this thread that has yet insinuated that it would be possible to sue Blizzard over the new terms of use. Counter-suing is a viable option though, if the need arises.<br />

They decide what is allowed to be run on their IP, how it is run etc.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Let me clarify: World of Warcraft and all it's contents belong to Blizzard Entertainment. Addons, regardless of how wonderful they might be, are technically all &quot;guests&quot; that use World of Warcraft as a base of operations. One could say, Blizzard is acting in this regard as a land lord, and thus allowed to decide whatever they see fit.<br />
<br />
<br />
And World of Warcraft is guest on the Microsoft/Apple platform. So it is ok if MS tells Blizzard that they have to give out WoW for free? I don't think so...<br />
<br />
A lot of people here seem to think that the development of an addon is something that is done in a few hours or so and is not worth anything. Addon authors should have the right to take the amount of money they think their addon is worth and if the user does not want to pay it then he/she should not be allowed to use it. <br />
<br />
But it is nice to see that people even think that this is a good move from Blizzard ... I really hope that a good amount of software developer stop publishing their addons to the public so that you get a feeling on how valuable their work was.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, refuse to continue update your addon until you can dictate the conditions for blizzard.<br />

I agree, sadly though -- this is essentially Socialism. I would love it if every single addon provider stopped producing their addon.<br />
<br />
Also, World of Warcraft is simply a LUA interpreter as far as Addon coding is concerned. I am not sure how Blizzard has convoluted the idea that a free programming language should not follow standard GNU rules but they can turn around and attempt to enforce GNU rules on others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Uh, copyright law? Laws about licensing and terms of use (whatever they are called in the US)?<br />
<br />
It is very likely that addons are considered derived works of WoW and they certainly require the platform &quot;WoW&quot; to work. This case is completely covered by copyright law. <br />
<br />
For example the GPL regulates derived works very strictly (even stricter than Blizzard) and this has been confirmed by courts several times. If you link to my GPLed-software - and publish your software - you have to use the GPL as well or I might sue you (and I would win).<br />
<br />
*If* there is a weakness it's the fact that those rules are new. You could argue that Blizzard may not impose such restrictions after a few years.<br />
<br />
In addition to bare copyright of the software there is the platform issue. Blizzard can regulate the use of their platform as they see fit. Just like Ebay can ban certain legal yet unwanted products or Sony/Microsoft/Nintendo can refuse licenses for their consoles or the operator of a web forum can ban users.<br />
<br />
Again, you can only argue that Blizzard changed the rules.</div></div><hr />

Under this fact. addons developed before and upto the rules were put into effect are not legally bound to the rules until updated or created after the rules were posted.<br />
<br />
Blizzard will have to break the addons in that were/are being sold and force them to be updated before they can enforce the rules.<br />

<br />
<br />
In terms of code developement, yes you can. Functionally, the World of Warcraft is equivalent to an operating system, and the addons are 3rd party programs written to interact with it.<br />
<br />
How do you think windows programs actually run on windows? Microsoft has either published the API or given out a developement kit to interface with the operating system. If they didn't do that, people wouldn't be able to write code that would integrate and run on Windows. <br />
<br />
By the same token, if Blizzard did not provide the hooks to interface with the WoW client, there would be absolutely no third party addons. It's a pretty direct parallel. <br />
<br />
Blizzard is certainly free to modify *their* intellectual property so that your intellectual property no longer works with it, but at no point can they claim your IP as theirs, unless you specifically assign copyright to them. Pretty much the worst thing they can do is just add these guidelines to the EULA/ToS and then take action through that.<br />
<br />
Of course, let's say that I no longer play WoW. Let's just say. Now let's just say that I happen to sell a file that has some lua code in it that just happens to work with WoW as an addon. Since I don't play WoW anymore (which means I will have never agreed to a EULA/ToS with those guidelines in it), would Blizzard have a legal leg to stand on? Be an interesting court case, if it ever came about.<br />
<br />
Realistically, Blizzard will send CnD's to addon authors which annoy them. And since most addon authors probably don't have the cash to mount a defense against Blizzard in the first place, they'll Cease and Desist and the addon will go gently into the quiet night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All the QQing, all the nerd rage, all the straw arguments! LOL<br />
<br />
Blizzard is NOT Microsoft, they provide a service and like it or not, Copyright law actually requires them to vigorously protect their copyright or else it weakens their IP.<br />
<br />
For FOUR years mod authors have gotten along with pretty much giving out their addons, and all of a sudden in the last few months I've heard nothing but QQing from members of said community (and armchair lawyers from all over the globe) about how they have a RIGHT to sell their code.<br />
<br />
Um... I hate to break this to you, but last I checked, you can't copyright a derivative product. <br />
<br />
Try this example: You can't go around and change the skins for, say, Half Life 2, and then try to SELL it as your own product. You can't even SELL the skins, no matter how much work and effort you put into it, because that work is a derivative of a copyrighted work. You can always ask for donations, but you also can't FORCE someone to donate (which is essentially selling it), nor can you have skins that flash &quot;BUY ME&quot; or &quot;DONATE! DAMN YOU!&quot; if you haven't sent in a donation. <br />
<br />
I donate to mod authors whose mods I couldn't live without, and even if it's only a couple of bucks here and there I don't mind and will continue to do so, but the whole reason I won't touch Carbonite with a ten foot pole is because they have a paid version and the day I pay for an addon it better give me bj's and pudding! <br />
<br />
The only reason people feel they can get away with charging for 'their work' is because WoW is so large. I NEVER saw this argument pop up with any other MMO or FPS game I have ever played, which is curious.</div></div><hr />

<br />
An example I can see is along the lines of Outfitter and the New Duel Spec changing gear automagically....<br />
<br />
<br />
Reminds me of the LoLCat's &quot;I STE4LZ JOOR CODEZ!&quot;.......<br />
<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt that they'd just steal code, and I seriously doubt they want the code open so they *can* steal it.<br />
<br />
The more likely reason for the open source requirement is simply so that the code is available for review, in case someone is doing something they really shouldn't be doing. <br />
<br />
If you feel otherwise, all of the additional functionality of the UI that's been added is open code and is available for review, you can do the code audit yourself to see if they're stealing code, or if they're just implementing the same idea with their own code.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elsydeon</div><div class="date">2009-03-21, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the quick and dirty guide to these changes:<br />
<br />
1,2,4, and 5: just enforcing the norms; some addons were bad about &quot;asking&quot; for donations, some had trial verisons which confused players, and dont recall hearing of addons with ads, but its a natural extension of the rule; the obfuscation and public distro stuff are from RDX http://www.openrdx.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=273 (Venificus hid his code and had kept it only for his guild, each copy was individualized so he knew who had leaked it)<br />
<br />
3: some were bad (old auctioneer, threat 2.0, etc.) because they spammed chat with data, data mined the AH; its also to get authors to clean thier code up (sloppy coding + sloppy coding + sloppy coding = sad panda waiting at loading screen to get into a raid with low fps because his intel &quot;extreme&quot; graphics sucks)<br />
<br />
6: Hot Coffee and Obama (yes, politics inbound, but its BIG part of the why, this one is big and will be a three parter): <br />
<br />
Hot Coffee made a precident that not-included content can be used against a game's rating (HC was in the game files, but NOT in the game itself); the recent election of Obama and his (and his DNC handlers') complete antipathy for business rights (because businesses dont vote, but pissed off people do) and power over the the media (most networks are DNC mouthpieces, except FOX) combined with complete DNC control of the house and near complete over the senate, and soon possible complete control over the supreme court (get 60 senators [to pass filibuster] and the democrat controlled house to agree to expand the size of the court to 21, then appoint 12 lackeys and anything president-for-life Obama and his DNC masters wants will become &quot;magically&quot; constitutional, including blatant censorship, without any guise of &quot;child protection&quot;)<br />
<br />
now the future business landscape is understood, some addon guy makes an addon that makes the girls actually naked (naked tex mods exist for most games); the ESRB sees this and gives WoW an M rating; which the now &quot;magically&quot; constitutional (the DNC acts as a rather unified party so the governers or the feds would push this one) and &quot;glorious&quot; (because most of the press is DNC lackeys who will talk about how it helps our society) &quot;no M games to minors&quot; laws kick in<br />
<br />
for those who didnt read the above two paragraphs:<br />
<br />
WoW gets an M rating, then loses sales because kids cant get game cards (because retailers dont want to deal with the legal hassle) and some retailers dont carry &quot;M&quot; games at all; and all because some guy wants to (you know what) to naked purple girls because he cant get real porn<br />
<br />
8: there are API's which need to be depreciated and removed at times, the big API change of 2.0 is a great example (you dont need a mod to auto decurse, kill things for you, etc. while you are alt tabbed out looking at the real porn the guy above cant get)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The glider ruling is not really applicable to LUA script addons. In the case of glider, it was purposely trying to defeat a safeguard that Blizzard put in place.<br />
<br />
In the case of addons, Blizzard wrote the API and made it available to developers. Intent counts for alot. It's hard to argue than anything Blizzard has done had the intention of making bot programs acceptable for use in World of Warcraft, they've always worked against it. In the case of addons, otoh, they have a 4+ year history of making an API available, publishing an SDK for that API, and developers who interface with the addon developement community for the purpose of feedback and communication about UI changes which have an effect on addons. <br />
<br />
Night and day. If Blizzard tried to sue an addon author for charging for their addon, and it was someone who actually had the clout to go head to head with Blizzard, I think Blizzard would be handed their heads on a platter.<br />

No matter how shitty the addon or what you think of people charging for it. FUCK BLIZZARDS mentality thinking they can control how people freely interact in a free market. Who the hell are they to tell anyone what they can do with addons BESIDES turning off functionality in their game where they have FULL RIGHT to do so. <br />

I wonder if all the hoopla will have the side-effect of people rushing out and donating to their favorite mod authors either out of spite or out of a need to see the mods continue. ;D<br />

I do find the sheer level of nerd rage hilarious tho. *grabs popcorn and sits back to watch the festivities*<br />

I am RELATIVELY certain that Blizzard didn't do this with the intent of going after all the mod authors out there, but both in response to Glider (one end of the spectrum) and Carbonite (the other end) and complaints from their user-base about both. <br />
<br />
Personally? I haven't used a mod that bugged me for donations yet, even QH was remarkably subtle about it. I highly doubt what the vast majority of mod authors out there would ever so much as hear a blip from Blizz. <br />

I personally never buy them or neither have the skill to create them, but Blizzard is basically limiting the new generation of programmers. <br />
<br />
They should be supporting other people who try to make money through programming instead of eliminating them. I personally believe that mostly only young people would code these kind of add-ons and i've heard a lot of great success stories of young people making money off small applications. It's definitely sad that they did this.</div></div><hr />

From a moral stand point it's a terrible decision. If you create an add on for a game, (essentially for Warcraft you are using it to interpret the code using the Blizzard API) you should have every right to decide how it gets distributed. Sadly, since 90% of the game is a bunch of casual players, they feel that paying for an addon is unfair.<br />
<br />
You aren't forced to run with addons, you aren't forced to use them, hell you aren't even forced to play the game. But, everything is so unfair in it. I can't wait, 2 more expansions and we will have 3 perfectly balanced classes and 1 race. No epics, no end game, nothing to make people feel like lesser players. Only 1 level. Kill rabbits all day with a stick in some gray items.</div></div><hr />

I suggest you actually read Title 17 of the USC. Also, try to understand something - most LUA code makes no use of blizzard assets. They make no use of Blizzard code. They do interface with Blizzard's API, but that's what Blizzard provided it for, so you'd be very hard pressed to win an infringement case based on that. No one's arguing that their code has a right to be run in the WoW client, that decision lies solely with Blizzard themselves. But as far as the actual code of an addon goes, the author owns the copyright. I don't think you quite understand what a derivative work is. <br />
<br />
If I take the addon code that blizzard has provided (and indeed replaces automatically if you remove it), and I extend that, that's a derivative work. If I code an entirely new addon with functionality that the UI does not provide on it's own, that's an original work. Blizzard is free to cripple the function of that addon in any way they see fit, but they cannot claim it infringes on their copyright.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
You're correct in that a nude mod has the possibility for getting WoW's ESRB rating modified, but those kinds of addons are not governed by these new rules. Nude skins are mods, not addons, there's a difference. In order to get nude models into the game, you have to actually modify data files, those never touch the addon API. That kind of thing has always been covered by the EULA, and Blizzard has acted on it before. (If you'll remember, a certain guild was pretty much banned in it's entirety for using a mod which removed walls in AQ40). In the case of a nude mod, Blizzard has a direct case for copy infringement, since the person modifying them is messing with their assets. Even if someone did code an entirely new skin without modifying anything from Blizzard's assets, you're still guilty of breaking the EULA. And they'd probably have a case for punitive damages as well, since a nude mod raising the ESRB rating could directly effect the value of their IP.</div></div><hr />

One guy mentioned that when Blizzard adds a feature that is like a previously popular add on, they are normally not as superior.<br />
<br />
On top of that, if you really think that Blizzard NEEDS the code to be visable to take it on as their own, you need to think about it again. I am sure they can look at what an add-on does in their game and relatively quickly figure out the code. Having open code helps let people learn more about coding, the ones that care to figure it out, and even help people update old add-ons that arent being updated anymore.<br />

I understand people like to get paid for their work. The problem with requiring payment is that, as i said before, your add-on is nothing without WoW. You are making money off Blizzards work.</div></div><hr />

First off one must understand that in order to write a WoW add-on you need to use Blizzard's API, which Blizzard owns. Here's something else to think about, when someone uses Blizzard's API, they agree to it's TOU. This implied agreement acts as a contract. If you break the TOU, well then if you don't stop using Blizzard's API and stop distributing our add-on, Blizzard has all the right in the world to sue you to stop you from using their API and from damaging their product (WoW).<br />

<br />
Perhaps you should try and understand bandwidth is not free. People can use GoogleCode if they don't want advertising on the page that hosts their add-on.<br />
<br />
It's fully up to the author to determine if a add-on is to be hosted one or another place. Personally I host on WoWInterface, as I do not support CurseForge's &quot;premium&quot; model.<br />
<br />
To people who complain about license to interact with a API:<br />
<br />
You never been coding in the real world. Every single 3rd part API is licensed, and so is build tools, compilers etc.<br />
<br />
The specification for C# might be free (ECMA) and not very strong licensed, but the MSBuild compiler is *not* and is very strong licensed.<br />
<br />
To people who complain about the open-source requirement:<br />
<br />
rms would come yelling at you if he finds out where you live.<br />
<br />
Closed Source and Obfuscating never been good for anyone. You try support legacy APIs where the developers retired 10 years ago, and nobody got the source on hand.<br />
<br />
Resource / HEX editors, Disassemblers and memory hooks ain't fun. <br />
<br />
To everybody:<br />
<br />
I wish non-developers would stop moaning in this thread and leave the talking to those who actually developers add-ons, or code professional in real life.<br />

<br />
Someone building a better mouse trap is a risk in any business (unless, of course, you have the patent.... wouldn't that be fun, patenting a method to do something in an online game via addon, and then sue the host game for infringing on your patent when they implement similar functionality!). The API exists at Blizzard's sufferance, and no guarantee was ever provided with it. Really, this kind of scenario is precisely what Netscape went through with Internet Explorer. Parent company coded a similar app and integrated it tightly with the parent product, offered it for free, third party vendor goes bust. Though if the suits against Microsoft in the EU are any indication, someone might actually be able to file suit against Blizzard hehe<br />
<br />
Blizzard has always been pretty adamant about quashing any secondary markets that rise up around their games, so while the no chargey provision is kind of a dick move, it's consistent with their approach. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure that Carbonite and Curse were the straws that broke the camel's back, but profiting off of their product to the detriment of the in-game playerbase, especially in a public fashion, only became a 'visible' issue when the whole Glider thing broke. I don't necessarily say Glider is to blame for the current changed rules, but I'm sure it's made them more proactive when it comes to issues that might pop up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, near as I can tell, what likely prompted this was a post in the UI forum about Carbonite profiting off of Blizzards work. I'm sure someone upstairs took notice of that. Paying for addons is nothing new, I gladly paid for a subscription to RDX6. And I don't regret it one bit, especially since Venificus did the right thing and open sourced it when he wasn't going to continue developing it anymore.<br />
<br />
The no-obfuscated code provision makes absolute sense, though. While you can't exactly keylog and obtain usernames and passwords at login, you can still do some nasty stuff via LUA. For example, if I were to make a popular addon and obfuscate the code, I could include within a subroutine that, if I sent you a tell with a particular keyword, would log you out. And you'd never see the tell, just the count down until camp if you were actually at the keyboard, and a character select screen if you weren't. I always thought it'd be nice to sneak that one into a battleground mod. I never checked to see whether it was possible to make some set afk with a tell. <br />
<br />
But it's also a fairly simple to hook the tell function, have it check if a certain username is online, and if so, send the outgoing and incoming tells to that person, without notifying the player running the mod that they sent out an additional tell. Hell, I could send you a tell and make it look like it came from someone else entirely. This possibility should scare the crap out of all you folks who like to cyber in WoW. Could intercept officer and guild chat in a guild the same way.<br />
<br />
Now let's imagine a little more nefarious. How about a mod that, when you send a tell to someone with guildinvite access, automatically sends you a guild invite. Now what happens if that person has promote access? Oops, there goes your guild bank. I didn't try to test whether it was possible to transfer guild leadership or force a guild disband via remote control, though. Nor have I tried it with any of the arena team functions. I sincerely hope someone at Blizzard gets a clue and decides to flag these API functions as Protected so that third party code can't invoke them.<br />
<br />
Those are just a few ways you can get cute with LUA, and why a ban on obfuscated code is a very good thing. This kind of thing wouldn't stand up long with the source code disclosed, but would be fairly difficult to detect if obfuscated code addons became more common than openly available source ones (right now, if someone tried that crap, and you only had one obfuscated code addon, your suspicions would probably immediately go to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some thoughts:<br />
<br />
1. ALL addons can be read by a programmer, no matter what hoops the author goes through to make it harder (obfuscation). There is a cleartext version of Carbonite out there, ultimately, LUA is a script language and as such, it can always be read (with more or less effort). I think the demand of Blizzard to refrain from obfuscation is a good thing.<br />
<br />
2. The whole discussion about legalese that has been thrown around seems to miss one obvious point: Blizzard grants the user the right to play WOW as long has he abides by the TOS/EULA. If an addon is deemed to violate the TOS/EULA, then Blizzard has every right to ban that player from continuing to play (or, more likely, patch the client to refuse to load certain addons by default). Blizzard has the right to change these TOS/EULA everytime they want (for example, you have to reaffirm your compliance at every patch).<br />
<br />
3. The most professional addons I have seen so far, are all free and programmed by people who take pride in their work and probably wouldn't think of charging anything for their addons.<br />
<br />
4. I agree with people saying that the code of the addon itself is actually the authors own copyright, which it is. Whether the source is clearly readable or not does NOT make any (legal) difference. So theoretically, if Blizzard were to incorporate the functionality of an existing addon by reusing its code without the express consent of the original author, this would constitute a copyright infringement. That is also why I'm pretty sure they don't allow their devs to even look at the code of an addon, because it might make them vulnerable to all different kinds of fun law suits.<br />
<br />
5. All the comparisons of Windows, PS3, WOW and such is complete nonsense and has no relevance. Just because Microsoft allows you to run whatever you want on Windows, doesn't mean that they COULDN'T forbid selected applications (for example due to stability or security reasons). For every PS3 game out there, Sony gets a cut, that is something that they require in their licensing and nobody complains...<br />
<br />
6. From a developers point of view, the only thing that changes is that (a) I can't charge for my addons anymore and (b) I can only ask for donations unobtrusively (webpage and source code). For most developers, this doesn't affect their work at all, for some it is harsh (if they built a business model around an addon).<br />

What's your point? In a modern day society you expect people to obey the rules/laws to a reasonable level. <br />

Well, that's kind of my point. If Blizzard were to sue an addon author for not complying with their guidelines, they'd be quite a bit in the wrong (note: this doesn't include banning an account, or modifying the API to kill that functionality, that's all internal stuff. I doubt they consult their lawyer everytime they ban an account for breaking the EULA). But to actually try and get an injunction to prevent distribution, or seek damages against a third party author? If someone were willing to take that to court, Blizzard would probably lose horribly. <br />

The reality is that it would never get that far. The addon author probably couldn't afford the legal fees, and would fold at the first cease and desist letter. I know I would. That method of operation is not the Rule of Law that you seem to be in favor of, it's the Rule of Might. Big difference. Blizzard is not a governing body, they don't get to make the law. Like any other entity, be it individual or corporate, they play the system for a gain in their best interest. Just like the bored college kid trying to make a little scratch for a couple hours of script work.</div></div><hr />

Functionally, the World of Warcraft is equivalent to an operating system, and the addons are 3rd party programs written to interact with it.<br />
<br />
How do you think windows programs actually run on windows? Microsoft has either published the API or given out a developement kit to interface with the operating system. If they didn't do that, people wouldn't be able to write code that would integrate and run on Windows. <br />
<br />
By the same token, if Blizzard did not provide the hooks to interface with the WoW client, there would be absolutely no third party addons. It's a pretty direct parallel.<br />
<br />
The difference being that Microsoft's license allows for commercial use. Blizzard's does not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, let's say that I no longer play WoW. Let's just say. Now let's just say that I happen to sell a file that has some lua code in it that just happens to work with WoW as an addon. Since I don't play WoW anymore (which means I will have never agreed to a EULA/ToS with those guidelines in it), would Blizzard have a legal leg to stand on? Be an interesting court case, if it ever came about.<br />
<br />
I doubt Blizzard is going to waste their time with such a case. However, if you made the code widely available for purchase and promoted it as a WOW add on, then you're going to have problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
Realistically, Blizzard will send CnD's to addon authors which annoy them. And since most addon authors probably don't have the cash to mount a defense against Blizzard in the first place, they'll Cease and Desist and the addon will go gently into the quiet night.<br />
<br />
<br />
The truth is that this being blown way out of proportion. There are hardly any pay add ons -- we're literally talking about 2 or 3 out of thousands that have been developed for the game. Even add ons that advertise or ask for donations in-game are in the extreme minority.</div></div><hr />

The battlenet tos have been expanded to cover in game advertising, so they may be planning something of their own.<br />

<br />
And if blizzard dont like a certain addon, im sure they can find ways to prevent them from working, instead of legal actions. <br />

I'm sure they can't - without hitting a ton of other addons.<br />

Do blizzard pay the huge bandwidth bills sites like wowace or curse have when a new patch is release, i think not, so ofc they should be able to make money with the different tools for keeping peoples addon up to date, or via advertisements. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now you sound like a whining child. It is in no way Blizzards responsiblity to pay any sites anything. wowace or curse chose to host that because they think they can make money from it (subscriptions and adds) not because they think you are a sweet person. And if they can't make money from it, that is their problem. Not Blizzards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This doesn't mean the end of paid for versions of addons, they seem to just be saying that the solicitation of money cannot appear within the game itself. They specifically say that &quot;such requests should be limited to the add-on website&quot;. <br />

All add-ons must be distributed free of charge.

<br />
<br />
To a degree. Section 2b of the EULA pretty much prevents a user from directly making a profit off an addon. Now, if I happen to be selling a subscription to a website that has an addon for download (which is pretty much what the Carbonite guys were doing), and I happen to personalize that addon, and expire it (you know, just so I can be sure people are getting proper updates for any bugs), that's just a value added service. And it pretty much defeats Section 2b of the EULA.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt Blizzard is going to waste their time with such a case. However, if you made the code widely available for purchase and promoted it as a WOW add on, then you're going to have problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
More likely scenario - Let's say I'm a former WoW addict. I've complied with Blizzard's policies to terminate the license that I agreed to when I played. Now I decide to setup a website. On this website, I advertise that for authors who are interested in selling their addons, I will purchase their addons, code and all, copyright reassigned to me. I will also offer a percentage of all sales to the original author. And just to be a dick, the website is hosted in the Netherlands. Since I'm no longer bound by Blizzard's Terms of Service, they have nothing that's actionable against me (not to mention they now have to get involved in international law instead of US law if they do want to bring suit). Since the original author is no longer responsible for the addon and not involved in the sale or distribution, they're not actionable. As long as the addon doesn't use blizzard's assets like tiles and art, and as long as it only uses the hooks the API provides, they have no case for copyright infringement. <br />
<br />
The only thing left for Blizzard to do is take action against the people who actually use the products and are bound by the ToS. <br />
<br />
If you think this kind of thing is easy to prosecute, I suggest you go have a conversation with Microsoft and Cisco. They've been trying to put certain companies that provide 'test preparation' materials out of business for years. But those companies aren't bound by any of Microsoft or Cisco's licensing or non-disclosure agreements, so instead they're focusing on the users of the products instead. It's much the same thing with the gold sellers. They don't really have any legal recourse against the companies with websites that advertise gold selling or powerlevelling, all they can do is take action against the accounts that are involved in those activities. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Oh, without a doubt. The majority of the WoW addon community is of the open source frame of mind, so this has little to no effect.

Actually, it'd be pretty easy. Addons have to supply their name to the client as part of the metadata. All they'd have to do is add a check of the name provided vs. a database as part of the load function, and if the name is matched, don't load it. That way they wouldn't even have to patch to ban new addons.</div></div><hr />

The key part of that paragraph you linked is that you can not charge people to download or access an addon.<br />
<br />
The new curse client's premium/subscriber service is when it's installing the addons. In the premium vesion you'll get a one button update service . In the free version you'll see a button for each addon that has an updated version for it. You click on the button next to the addon to download that addon.<br />
<br />
<br />
In no way shape or form does the free version prevent you from downloading or acessing an addon it just takes a little longer thats all.<br />
<br />
<br />
But you are not allowed to have two version, so it could apply IF curse were the authors themselves and not just leeches of others.</div></div><hr />

These softwares don't work independently from Windows, they enhance the user experience of Windows.<br />
<br />
Of course Microsoft allows software development like this for their product, whereas Blizzard doesn't.<br />
<br />
Anyway, maybe Blizzard needs to host their own addons site, put up ads, and share profits with the developers like Google shares profits with YouTube contributors.<br />
<br />
Additionally, it would help Blizzard's image if when they blatently copy and integrate an addon into the game themselves that they reward the developer in some way... maybe through a monthly addon contest with a cash prize.<br />
<br />
<br />
Microsoft Windows is an operating system, if they didn't allow development of proprietary software then it wouldn't succeed very well. <br />
<br />
And besides, they charge, or at least used to charge, huge amounts of money for access to their Software Development Kits and stuff so you could have full access to the Windows APIs.

Was actually thinking the same thing. I don't think it's too far fetched that Blizzard would allow you to submit addons for the store, set your price, and they take a cut of the sale. They could also set it up so that the client automatically updates your paid apps to their latest version. I think more than a few folks would be willing to toss a buck here and there to keep their cherished apps either updatable automatically, or having the ability to one click update them from the blizzard launcher</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, and I hope they do in the end. I love open source and think that should be viable but, no one should have a right to dictate how someone's code should get distributed. If people want to sell a Firefox addon, they can and you never have to buy it, that is your choice. I think people need freedom of choice. It's what makes the world great.<br />

Not the same at all. The Blizzard API is nothing more than a open sourced scripting language that they have modified. Windows is written from the ground up and not based on an open source format like unix. An addon is not the same as a program. You have to compare WoW to Firefox or Adobe Air.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It all depends -- using the language of the new UI policy, it is possible for Blizzard to require all addon creators to submit their addons to a Blizzard Store. They set a price for the d/l of the addon, free of charge or premium. They take the addon, add a serial key to it that hooks to your Battle.net account (which will be the only way to download addons), upon logging in, you are taken to a addons screen before character select where all addons are validated against the serial key on your account. Wham-o cheap auto enforcement and shut off of addons is allowed under their new policy.</div></div><hr />

But it does infringe on copyright, you just don't understand how the law looks at that.

They need to say definitively what IS allowable and clearly give examples of what is NOT. Because some authors put their donation information in the setup menus (which might be allowable, it might also not be, the wording could be construed either way). What about authors that need input from the playerbase? Are they not allowed to ask for assistance in ANY form? I mean questhelper needs data, and there's a message saying so, why is THAT allowable but asking to &quot;Help keep this addon alive&quot; not? <br />
<br />
Most mod authors also have information about where their mod is hosted primarily, you'd assume if an author is going to ask for donations, that's the place they're going to do so... is that a violation of the new ToU?<br />
<br />
I absolutely think there needs to be further refinement of the change in ToU so as to clarify some pretty common 'grey area' issues.<br />
<br />
And once again, this whole argument seems strange, because I have been using community mods for over a decade (Tribes I&amp;II, EQ, etc) and don't EVER remember hearing this much boo hoo-ing over not being able to charge for addons/mods.<br />
<br />
(Also - the spelling/grammar/bad word choices I've been reading in this thread make me fear for the species... just felt I needed to get that off my chest)</div></div><hr />

How many addons do you use that you have to pay for? There is only 1 or 2 as it is now that have a paid to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pitbull, Cartographer, Outfitter, QuestHelper, nUI to name a few.<br />
<br />
These are addons that are financed by donations encouraged by breaking point #5. The authors response to this policy so far has in one case been to pull their addons from all download sites, in others to announce that they will no longer keep up the work on their addons eventually resulting in compability issues.<br />
<br />
This policy, unless radically altered, might have a serious negative impact on the playing experience for hundreds of thousands of Warcraft players who use these addons and in the long run for even more since quality addons will get scarce.<br />
<br />
Developing and supporting good addons takes tons of work. If the authors choose to finance this by asking for donations in a non-intrusive way in the addon or by fees to use them that should be their right.</div></div><hr />

5) Add-ons may not solicit donations.<br />
Add-ons may not include requests for donations. We recognize the immense amount of effort and resources that go into developing an add-on; however, such requests should be limited to the add-on website or distribution site and should not appear in the game.<br />
<br />
they can still request donations, however they can not have that request used in-game. Pitbull, Outfitter and questhelper for example do not require you to pay to use the most up to date addon. You can kindly donate to these creators but you do not &quot;have&quot; to pay. So again i ask how many addons do you use that require you to pay for them to use them</div></div><hr />

How often do you go to the author's page to download the addon? Just curious, if you say everytime -- you are a liar. If you say sometimes, that might be true. On top of that have you ever donated? Written an addon? Involved yourself in the community? Do you just have an opinion to have one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually there a few addons i been to author's page. I have at times donated though never anything bigger than $5 as i live check to check so can't afford more. Again that would affect sites like curse and other 3rd party websites that host addons. Which if a creator is deadset on wanting donations they would just make their addon exclusive to their own website. That is beside the point, even those who put a donation button on there addons that you can click on in game, chances are many don't see them anyways, most likely most donations come from the user clicking the link on a website. Blizzard stated that with rule #5 that was fine.<br />
<br />
However the question was in response to the poster saying that if creator could not charge a fee to use their addons that people would see most the popular addons disappear. So i asked how many addons do you use that you are &quot;required&quot; to pay to use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, I'd like to remind you that I responded to your response to the following post.<br />
<br />
<br />
this is the end of the best addons<br />
<br />
why would they develop them, waste their time if they cant get money for it<br />
<br />
This is why the fact that I don't pay cash for any addon is a compleately moot point.<br />
<br />
There is a reason that Outfitter has been discontinued, that QuestHelper has been partially discontinued, that Ckknight has hinted that he might discontinue his addons (for example Pitbull and Cartographer).<br />
<br />
The reason is that without the ability to ask for donations ingame the number of players that will donate dwindles dramatically, to the point where they are absolutely negligeble. People only ever visit sites when they need to upgrade if even that (hello Curse client), and then they have enough to think about downloading and installing. Its simple psychology.<br />
<br />
I use tons of addons whos continued existence is in deep jeopardy because of this policy, including the free version of Carbonite. This might end up beeing the single action by Blizzard that lowers the quality of my gaming experince the most.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nazrakin</div><div class="date">2009-03-22, 01:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To a degree. Section 2b of the EULA pretty much prevents a user from directly making a profit off an addon. Now, if I happen to be selling a subscription to a website that has an addon for download (which is pretty much what the Carbonite guys were doing), and I happen to personalize that addon, and expire it (you know, just so I can be sure people are getting proper updates for any bugs), that's just a value added service. And it pretty much defeats Section 2b of the EULA.<br />
<br />
The section clearly forbids any &quot;add on related services&quot; or any &quot;monetary compensation to download or access an add on&quot;. Now if you're going to pretend that the website subscription has absolutely nothing to do with the add on, then you leave yourself with no recourse if someone were to download your add on and distribute it freely to others.<br />
<br />
<br />
More likely scenario - Let's say I'm a former WoW addict. I've complied with Blizzard's policies to terminate the license that I agreed to when I played. Now I decide to setup a website. On this website, I advertise that for authors who are interested in selling their addons, I will purchase their addons, code and all, copyright reassigned to me. I will also offer a percentage of all sales to the original author. And just to be a dick, the website is hosted in the Netherlands. Since I'm no longer bound by Blizzard's Terms of Service, they have nothing that's actionable against me (not to mention they now have to get involved in international law instead of US law if they do want to bring suit). Since the original author is no longer responsible for the addon and not involved in the sale or distribution, they're not actionable. As long as the addon doesn't use blizzard's assets like tiles and art, and as long as it only uses the hooks the API provides, they have no case for copyright infringement.<br />
<br />
The only thing left for Blizzard to do is take action against the people who actually use the products and are bound by the ToS. <br />
<br />
The original authors are still in violation of the ToU since they are receiving a percentage of your sales and they knew what you intended to do. If someone were nutty enough to move to the netherlands just to sell 3 add ons, then I imagine blizzard would put the lawyers away and sic their programmers after you instead - just as they have with goldsellers.</div></div><hr />

Every single time i download an addon its from the authors release point. <br />
It is of course going to be the place where they provide the latest version before all others.<br />

I love how it's greed to want to make money, I guess we should all be hippy socialists? BTW prove to me that people have made better unit frames? I would love to see it, because it hasn't happened since pitbull came out, so why would it happen suddenly? The truth is you will have lower quality addons and you will like it, because that is what you deserve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh boy, you opened up the code of carbonite since it was first made?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
2) Add-on code must be completely visible.<br />
The programming code of an add-on must in no way be hidden or obfuscated, and must be freely accessible to and viewable by the general public.<br />
<br />
You just know as soon as they release a version that isn't obfuscated they wont be seeing anymore donations.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW prove to me that people have made better unit frames?<br />
<br />
quantify &quot;better&quot;.<br />
<br />
because right now, i see grid, healbot, pitbull and xperl as bloated pigs floating in a flotsam of diseased waste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Frankly, all of the best addons were free for years before people got the notion to start placing mandatory charges on them. The WoW addon community thrived for years before people started pulling this crap and it will continue to thrive afterwards now that Blizzard is putting a stop to it.<br />
<br />
If you want to donate to plugin authors you're still perfectly free to do so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Again, I doubt they need to see all the code if they wanted to implement an add-on into the game. I would assume they know their game well enough to look at the add-on and know what variables it is pointing at or access just by looking at what it does or how it looks.<br />
<br />
The open source seems to be more for the sake that there are people that want to learn how the add-ons work, and how to do certain things with their own set ups. it looks to be a way to get more people to try their hands at coding add-ons.<br />
<br />
One guy said there isnt a better unit frame than pitbull. That is a matter of opinion. people have different preferences. and you never know, people, that have thought about trying their hands at the coding, being able to see the code and play with it hands on, might be able to come up with a &quot;better unit frame&quot;</div></div><hr />

As a developer nothing will change for 99% of you. You will not get rich by developing addons for world of warcraft, live with it!<br />
<br />
Actually it means that if I write an addon it means I can not ask for donations in game. Thereby discourging me from writing it in the first place (since it takes up soooo much of my time)<br />
<br />
It's never been about getting rich for the authors (well maybe for the carbonite authors). It's about showing appreciation for the authors by giving them a &quot;Tip&quot; or &quot;Donation&quot;</div></div><hr />

I've been reading posts by the author of nUI in the UI &amp; Macros support forums. He's said that when he had voluntary donations on his addon page he got maybe $300 worth of donations over a year.

Without him posting proof I call total BS on it. Maybe his spam got to people so they donated to get his pro version with no stupid spam. I wish Blizzard would just take these whiner's addons and make it their own just like they did with Outfitter.<br />

Overall with the new rules added the only one I can disagree on is the authors having to post up their code. Other than that I am all for.</div></div><hr />

And I really applaud this change. Mods like QuestHelper and Carbonite been stopping every other attempt to make a decent quest mod for over a year. If Carbonite suddenly decides to stop, we'll finally see new attempts to create new mods.</div></div><hr />

Bad news, everyone. Questhelper's dead.<br />
<br />
Blizzard just posted their new UI Add-On Development Policy at http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/policy/ui.html. The important part is that I'm no longer allowed to ask for donations in-client. I know how much I got before I added the in-client reminder - it doesn't pay a significant fraction of the bills. And, as much as I like you guys, good intentions don't pay for my apartment.<br />
<br />
So that's it. I'm going to be finishing up and releasing v1.0, and I'll keep posting incremental database improvements every month or two. I do plan to keep QH functional, at least through the end of Wrath, and probably further. I've got one or two features in mind that I want to do for my own sake - a few achievements, mostly - but besides that (and the v1.0 release) that's pretty much all there's going to be.<br />
<br />
I would like to say: thanks to everyone who donated in the past. I enjoyed working on this quite a bit, and I always enjoyed seeing another donation come in - not just because of the money, but because it meant that people wanted to use QH and wanted to keep it going.<br />
<br />
Let Blizzard know if you don't like it, and if I can get an exception, I'll start everything right back up again :) <br />
<br />
Which is a complete joke. If he only wrote the add-on for money he should get a real job instead.<br />
But it doesn't matter, the code is horrible, the project is huge, and the memory consumption is though the roof.<br />
<br />
QH had it's days, it's time for others to pick the best of it's ideas and remodel the code to something usefull.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I respectfully disagree with you here.<br />

That somone can't understand your code doesn't necessarily make it bad. <br />
<br />
Here's an example for you : Charles Simonyi. He's the guy that helped create apps like MS Word , Excell and many of the microsoft applications you use today.<br />
<br />
He was able to remember what every one of his variables was for. So they weren't named logically. Nor did he have a habit of leaving comments in his code.<br />
<br />
And his code ran perfectly fine.<br />
Sure, but what do you do when someone else is to maintain your code? (And no, Hungarian Notation is NOT GOOD).<br />
<br />
People thinking they'll be the only person ever to revise their code always end up being wrong, at least if you're working in a company.<br />
<br />
image1,image2,image3 versus userAvatar, companyLogo, defaultContainerImage , or, HWDN versus WindowHandle, or even better: specify the name of the window: EditorWindowHandle <br />
<br />
And this is simple, imagine whole blocks (thousand of lines). Claiming good code don't matter just proves you have little to no experience ;)</div></div><hr />

Go read and understand the concept of open-source, and come back when you grasped it's not evil communism as you seem to think it is.<br />

If the author ain't using his/her own add-on, then why should the person maintain it? If we reached the stage where authors only maintain their creations due to funding, perhaps it's time to let go and let others replace them.<br />
<br />
But one important thing about open-source is acknowledge. You don't call something your own, you call your modifications your own, and otherwise credit the original author.<br />

You don't seem to understand that my addons respect all those who came before me. I never charged a dime for anything I created. I got permission for any author I ever used to help in the development of my addons. I have obeyed every rule of morality and blizzards current set of rules. I've helped people learn to code. I've helped anyone who asked for help.<br />
<br />
Then blizzard steps on my toes saying I basically have no rights to any of that. i love coding. I LOVE IT. I have a very good sense of right and wrong and this is just plain wrong.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lukefarer</div><div class="date">2009-03-22, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To those attacking the new policy - it's a game, folks.<br />
<br />
Addons make the game easier; that's their entire point. Blizzard are entitled to take such action as they see necessary to keep the playing field level; so that in order to be competitive a player need only pay his monthly subscription, and doesn't need to buy X, Y or Z addons.<br />
<br />
The existence of addons has an effect on game development. I'm not yet a raider, and will only ever be a casual one; but from reading about boss-kills, and strategies, it is clear that raiders are dependent on addons to give them the edge needed to down the content. That in turn means that Blizzard (to forestall the QQ'ing from the self-proclaimed &quot;elite&quot;) have to ramp up the difficulty, which makes the raider, casual or otherwise, even more dependent on addons. Make those raid addons paid for, and there's an entire section of Blizzard's game that is only effectively accessible by those who pay money to third parties for those addons. Yes, you can always write your own addon - but that is what the policy is aimed at enforcing; either write your own, or use what is freely available within the community.<br />
<br />
As for the claim that the policy (against paid-for addons) is not enforceable against the third party addon developers - I can see no obvious reason why advertising the addon for sale is not - in principle at least - procurement by the developer of a breach of contract on the part of the purchaser.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I pointed out that Cartographer's code is weird and hard to understand for anyone other than ck knight<br />
You said that this just proves it's bad code as it's not commented or logical to understand<br />
I made allusions to Charles Simonyi trying to point out the undocumented code isn't necessarily bad<br />
You then said I said good code doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
It's not that I don't think good code matters. I was trying to refute the assertion I believe you made that complex undocumented code can't be efficient and is in fact &quot;bad&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yes I have written code before. Yes I do appreciate the benefits of well documented open source code . But my definition of &quot;Good code&quot; is different from yours - code that is efficient and quick to run. By this definition good code can be assembly code I guess :P . (PS Yes I have tried to code in assembly before. The experience left me gibbering and drolling in a corner :o)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is clearly a licence (implied if not express) to use the API and the macro language to produce addons for personal in-game use. Good luck however in arguing that that licence extends to commercial exploitation.</div></div><hr />

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_software<br />
<br />
&quot;Open source software (OSS) is defined as computer software for which the source code and certain other rights normally reserved for copyright holders are provided under a software license that meets the Open Source Definition or that is in the public domain. This permits users to use, change, and improve the software, and to redistribute it in modified or unmodified forms. It is very often developed in a public, collaborative manner&quot;<br />
<br />
True of 99% of all addons I see in use today. Carbonite and RDX are the sole exceptions to this and RDX was released into the public domain when the original author stoppped coding it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I would never donate money towards a add-on author. But instead, I'd contribute to the community or to the specific authors own add-on.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you believe that someone who spends many hours of their time on an addon , coding it , maintaining it, updating it for bug fixes and providing user support for users who use such addon have no right to ask for any sort of compensation at all ?<br />
<br />
Even if it's voluntary and you don't have to donate ??<br />
<br />
99% of all authors I've seen who ask for donations aren't doing it as a fee system. It's more like a &quot;if you appreciate this addon donate here&quot; . RDX and Carbonite are to my knowledge the only 2 addons that have required users to pay for them. RDX was worse as they did not have a free version that Carbonite has.<br />

This is actually quite interesting legally.<br />
<br />
It's not at all obvious that selling something that would be perfectly ok if you gave it away can be classified as procurement of breach of contract. The Glider case was won because the contents of the Glider product was against the EULA, Carbonite on the other hand would only be against the EULA (if they incorporate this policy there) in the way it is distributed.<br />
<br />

<br />
No; Blizzard apparently has no problem with the distribution of the addons, provided they are made freely available to all players of the game. They are seeking to prevent others commercially exploiting their game by selling an (unfair, because unavailable without payment to a third party) advantage within the game.<br />
<br />
As I said in my second post - the licence to use the API and macro language is certainly there, but is also already conditional (for example, you can only use Lua to access the API). It would be surprising if the Courts read the licence as permitting commercial exploitation of the (copyrighted) game by third parties.</div></div><hr />

Thing is it doesn't work. Several well know addon authors have posted on the thread on the UI &amp; Macros forums saying essentially it doesn't work. People are lazy. People will also bypass the addon authors page by using auto updater programs like wowmatrix.<br />
<br />
I know of 3 - 4 authors who have received a pittance form their addon page donation links. $40 for one person and as much as $300 over a 1 year period for another person. One author said he'd made $4000 over 13 days when he put a non intrusive donation link in game. Even offered to post his pay pal records as proof if required. Website donations only bring in peanuts.<br />

EDIT: Let me clarify: World of Warcraft and all it's contents belong to Blizzard Entertainment. Addons, regardless of how wonderful they might be, are technically all &quot;guests&quot; that use World of Warcraft as a base of operations. One could say, Blizzard is acting in this regard as a land lord, and thus allowed to decide whatever they see fit.<br />

Yeah, and we are lucky, that not only addons writers write but pc-s that are used to play workcraft and even players that play warcraft don't yet belong to blizzard. After all, World of Warcraft is their intellectual property, if you forgot.<br />

<br />
17 USC 103b:<br />
The copyright in a compilation or derivative work extends only to the material contributed by the author of such work, as distinguished from the preexisting material employed in the work, and does not imply any exclusive right in the preexisting material. The copyright in such work is independent of, and does not affect or enlarge the scope, duration, ownership, or subsistence of, any copyright protection in the preexisting material.<br />
<br />
Let that sink in for a minute.<br />
<br />
Addons for WoW cannot function without: 1) WoW.exe, 2) the Blizzard developed API, 3) the Blizzard provided LUA scripting language. Addons are not independent programs that are indistinguishable from WoW itself. They are code, based on a series of rules granted by Blizzard to developers to interact with Blizzard's API. <br />
<br />
So what does 17 USC 103b say? It says that your XML and LUA scripts are yours, yes, as are any graphics you make custom for your own addon. But since none of this can do anything without Blizzard's copyrighted API, it remains, ultimately, a derivative work.<br />
<br />
Comparisons to Windows are unfounded, but those folks who try to compare it to making function calls to Windows API are overlooking the fact that developers who develop for Windows license the ability to program for the Windows API whether it be through Microsoft themselves or through fees associated with distribution. If you don't want to play ball with the Windows API, you program your own and license the ability to install on Windows machines (see: Installshield). Do addon programmers pay a license to Blizzard to program for their API? No, and don't try saying it's included in the monthly fee because it simply is not.<br />
<br />
As far as it being legally unenforcable... I remember people saying the same thing about Glider. Nothing is legally &quot;unenforcable&quot;, there will always be a first case, a possible sympathetic judge, or talented lawyers who can make a case out of seemingly irrelevant case law. I'm willing to bet there's already case law on a similar topic, probably in the California District Court system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Assuming this was a response to me. <br />
<br />
The only reasonable way for blizzard to attack this legaly is the way you have pointed out, by claiming procurement of breach of contract.<br />
<br />
Obfuscated source code might be enforceable legaly, however it is also a bit etchy since it is possible if not even probable that it be argued to be an unreasonable restriction in the EULA or atleast not something that Blizzard can claim any damages from. <br />
<br />
The advertisement is most probably enforceable and Carbonite would be very unwise indeed if they do not discontinue that version asap since Blizzard will most likely be able to sue for this after the next EULA version that will most likely come with 3.1<br />
<br />
The biggest point however is still that Blizzard tries to stop the act of selling addons, if they removed point #1 then the other points look like they probably would be enforceable. It would create a scenario where paid-for addons was ok but free addons asking for donations ingame would not be.<br />
<br />
Because of this I'm lobbying for #1 to be removed since it is Microsoftish bullying and #5 to be removed in order to keep as many addons as possible of good quality and still be free.</div></div><hr />

I'm willing to bet there's already case law on a similar topic, probably in the California District Court system.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Some addons can exist perfectly well outside of WoW, but lets for a moment say that wasn't the case and that you premise was 100% correct. Even if that is the case the addons still do not have any preexisting material employed in the work wich is what the text you are quoting refers to. The code is written independantly and doesn't copy any code from WoW.exe, WoW.exe compiles it and runs it, thats it.<br />
<br />
2. An API can be copied and emulated without this beeing a breach of copyright. As long as that is the case writing a program useing an API cannot be said to be derivative of a copyrighted API either. And even if APIs had stronger copyright protection the same argument as used in my above point applies, the code is written independantly without incorporating any copyrighted material. And where did you pick up the strange notion that programming for Windows required some kind of license? That simply isn't so.<br />
<br />
3. Blizzard have no copyright claim to LUA , at all. <br />
<br />
It might be enforceable in some fashion, however I have a hard time seeing them successfully claim either copyright or procurement of breach of contract if a case went all the way to ruling. The Glider case is orders of magnitude stronger than anything that has been presented in this thread or others, I'm not at all surprised about that ruling.</div></div><hr />

This mainly applies to stuff such as ace-libraries, however looking trhough them to find some examples of addons that doesn't call upon Blizzard exclusive API doesn't really lead anywhere. In theory many more could work in a setting with emulated API that copies WoW's (wich is perfectly legal to do). Also the addons have value outside of World of Warcraft since large chunks of the code can be used in other LUA settings. However, as I stated in the post you just quoted it wouldn't really matter even if this wasn't the case so arguing this is kind of pointless. So I will for the sake of argument surrender that the addons have no value if WoW doesn't exist since that doesn't really change anything.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nazrakin</div><div class="date">2009-03-22, 04:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh.I read your posts referring to greedy authors as generalising a broad section of addon authors.A few authors out of hundreds is not a lot of authors.<br />
<br />
Thing is it doesn't work. Several well know addon authors have posted on the thread on the UI &amp; Macros forums saying essentially it doesn't work. People are lazy. People will also bypass the addon authors page by using auto updater programs like wowmatrix.<br />
<br />
I know of 3 - 4 authors who have received a pittance form their addon page donation links. $40 for one person and as much as $300 over a 1 year period for another person. One author said he'd made $4000 over 13 days when he put a non intrusive donation link in game. Even offered to post his pay pal records as proof if required. Website donations only bring in peanuts.<br />
<br />
That's where a lot of people differ from you. In America it's considered customary to offer a &quot;tip&quot; for good service. Even though I'm not from the USA (kiwi) I can at least understand the sentiment behind it - &quot;you've done a good job , here's some cash to show you I appreciate you&quot;. Donations a way of saying &quot;I like what you're doing , here's some cash<br />
<br />
<br />
Listen, these are DONATIONS. These authors should not expect to get anything beyond a pittance, in fact they should not expect to get anything at all.<br />
<br />
And I call total bullshit on the idea that people are too &quot;lazy&quot; to click a donation link on a website. Yet, that same lazy person is able to click the donation link in game, copy the web address, alt-tab out of the game, paste the text into his web browser, and proceed to donate? That makes zero sense. If anything, the auto web downloader are the problem, and that is something the authors should be fighting against.</div></div><hr />

I agree that lazy is the wrong word. However, since there has been a lot of talk about this topic these last couple of days we have heard from people that do indeed donate that the ingame reminders actually are needed for them to donate. This is also supported by what the addon writers themselves are saying, and why would they lie about this? Why would they be against it if it wasn't that big a deal?</div></div><hr />

You make no sense, In your argument, people would never buy premium software. Everybody would have free AVG and not the premium versions. I have a copy of windows, I want to make it better in many ways, So I buy antivirus, antispyware, a utilities program etc. They are additions to windows and improve it, like Carbonite or Questhelper is to WoW just on a smaller scale. Heck I even want to make Windows look better, so I buy Windowblinds for windows, yah is cosmetic but I like the way it looks, so I buy it. <br />
Now I have bought all these additions/addons to windows, do you really care how I spend my money on my pc?<br />
<br />
The only difference here with this analogy is that microsoft and blizzard have different policies and in order to use additions to the software, you cant charge for them is blizzards stance. So why cant I donate to an addition to WoW that makes my experience way more enjoyable?<br />
<br />
And to all the haters that don't think charging for addons is honest, they have never probably used these superior addons and dont see the amount of time and effort that goes into them. So what people tried to make a living using their time skills to make an addon! Time is money and these people put alot of hard work making something that others really want to use. Most of them that use these kinds of addons feel it is worth it to pay these people for their time and effort, its that good! So if you had a skill that could make you money, and you loved doing it, wouldn't you do it? I know I would! <br />
<br />
Besides, coding in lua and selling it as they are doing is perfectly legal. You just cant use the sold lua script in wow.</div></div><hr />

you should work on your abstract thinking skills. you can't get past the fact that one's a game and one's an OS? both windows and WoW are development platforms in which applications are written.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2. Other persons and companies have the right to produce and sell said unwanted addons. <br />
<br />
The interesting thing is what happends when those producers start to work around Blizzards anti-measures and include a &quot;automatic updater&quot; with their addon to make sure that it is always working despite Blizzards attempt to stop it.<br />
<br />
Does Blizzard have any legal means to enforce their policy under these circumstances? If the answer is yes then that must mean that they actually have some legal way of making my point no.2 not true.<br />
<br />
Does Blizzard have any copyright claim to the addon code? No. The LUA language? No. The WoW API? No. The copyright venue doesn't seem applicable to stop this.<br />
<br />
What about procurement of breach of contract? (i.e what they got Glider on)<br />
<br />
Well, if they put in the EULA that players may not run addons that they have payed for then that could be claimed. The question then becomes do Blizzard have a right to stop users from useing addons solely on the basis of them having payed for it? This is far from certain as it would be a measure implemented solely to prevent addon writers from profiting from their personal copyrighted material. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying that it is impossible for Blizzard to win such a fight, far from it, but this is something that would have to be settled in court. It is not at all clear cut. <br />
<br />
Also this does indeed go further than just WoW. There are other programs where companies make serious money from selling addons. If the company that owns the mother program can on a whim decide that these companies no longer can charge that really is quite a blow to that entire market as the level of risk involved goes up.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that the lawyers at Blizzard have reached the conclusion that they do have the right to stop for-pay addons with stronger measures than simply trying to block them cat and mouse style. I would however be interested in hearing how that argument goes.</div></div><hr />

Because some people are against any type of restrictions on what they can do. As I pointed out earlier, these changes affect an extreme minority of add on authors.

Yes, but most of those 2000 addons are crap. the ones that ask and get donations tend (in my personal opinion) to be the best ones. This should come as no surprise since more donations =&gt; more incentive to work on the addon and treat it as work =&gt; better support and faster updates =&gt; more donations etc.<br />
<br />
I will be sad if Blizzard bans Ckknights addons for breaking this policy (he has said that he will not comply) and I think it is a shame that those persons who devote so much time to making our gaming experience that much better cannot even in a reasonable way point out that donations is what keeps them going to their users.<br />
<br />
<br />

This attitude is so strange to me. If someone wants to make a massivly expensive to develop addon because he thinks some players will really enjoy it and will happily pay for it what on earth is wrong with that?<br />
<br />
It is not like it is Blizzard who produces these addons or gives any money to the addon developers. They never see any of those $15. I fail to see any reasonable defence for your position since it is NOT like carbonite would exist and be free if they couldn't charge. It would not exist, players not using carbonite at all would neither be better or worse of, those benefiting from the free version of carbonite would be worse of (this includes me, thank you Carbonite) and those benefitting from the premium version would be worse of.<br />

I don't use any sort of automatic updater. I have an email update system. The author posts a new update. I get an email about it. I then visit the site , read change logs and comments. I then make the decision to update that addon or not.<br />
<br />
The community supports using wow matrix as it's convenient for them to do so. They would rather click one button rather than visit just the pages for the addons that change. Personally I find my email update system more convenient for me.<br />

Even among the best only a small number are affected by any of this. Looking at my on add on library I have 28 add ons installed and only 5 of them ask for donation in game. <br />

(wall of text omitted)<br />
<br />
You're missing the point. Blizzard is fully within their rights to do whatever they want to the API. Automating API change every startup to ban certain addons is a very simple task. Blizzard already does something rather similar to this with warden looking for malicious code residing in system memory when WoW is played.<br />
<br />
As an add-on developer, you can certainly defy blizzard and continue asking for money, obfuscating your code, etc. By doing so however, you don't just yourself open to blizzard simply breaking your add-on - that is something that happens over patches anyway. What really happens is that you essentially TAUNT blizzard to do that. <br />
<br />
To put it into WoW terms, this is a lvl1 human warrior walking into durotar dueling grounds and spamming /spit and /rude on lvl80s hordies dueling there. Legal discussion never comes to play for one simple reason - there are no grounds whatsoever for add-on maker to sue over, and blizzard does not require legal means to disable the add-on completely. And attempting to use auto-updater or similar software to get past possible protection envokes Glider precedence and puts developer's ass on the line.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I don't mind add-ons asking for donations once on startup. It's a bit annoying, but I can live with that much. What gets me on carbonite (and what probably broke it for blizzard) was carbonite deliberately breaking the very reason why Lua as the programming language was originally developed - ease of accessing source code in readable format. It's fairly clear that add-ons were originally designed to be open source - so that they could be improved by ALL users with decent programming skills. This has allowed for many great add-ons to remain functional even when original developers quit/vanish into nothingness/get hit with real life issues/etc. Excellent add-ons such as questhelper exist because it's so easy to access source code of the add-ons that another developer can simply pick the dropped project and develop it into something of their own. Carbonite developers specifically chose to screw everyone else over by essentially breaking their code to be unviewable. That really was the lvl1 human warrior in durotar action at its worst.</div></div><hr />
