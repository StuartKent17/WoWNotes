True. A bit tired of the same graphics for<br />

2 - Angry mob<br />
3 - Veteran mob<br />
4 - Berserker mob<br />

I don't think the developers understood that question, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
I think he meant that if the person leaves, Shadowmourne is stripped off of them for example, and then the GM or whatever can decide the next best person. That way nobody gets Shadowmourne with a guild, and leaves them, essentially leaving that guild high and fucking dry until the next one. However - that brings up issues of abuse. What was stopping somebody from kicking a person just to transfer Shadowmourne? And what happens when the guild breaks up?<br />
<br />
Not a good idea, in ANY form.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ST is not fun, at all. It was sorta cool the first time I did it, but it's just too windy and unnecessary. I don't totally get reducing Wailing Caverns, but w/e. And the image of Dire Maul's wings could just be turned into a map of all the ICC 5mans on one map, if they named them Icecrown North/East/West. Same thing.<br />
<br />
I still don't miss stuff like LBRS, Uldaman, or BRD. Unless you do them continuously as you leveled up, you really aren't going to know where the hell you're going :P <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If anything, bring back dungeons like the original Scholomance. Talk about difficult.</div></div><hr />

good, BRD is retarded to go through completely. You will rarely see all the bosses if you are leveling now, everyone just wants to get to the boss that is considered the final one (which in BRD is actually the first boss of the instance is the final one).</div></div><hr />

They will obviously, there's not point in releasing new 5mans if the loot isn't better then the raids that were previously up. Would you have seriously done the new ICC's if the stuff you got from it was worse then what you got from ToC/Ulduar? I personally wouldn't even have looked at it.</div></div><hr />

Personally, that's why I enjoyed the older dungeons. They were long, intricate puzzles that required a brain. What is so immmersive about being thrown right at the beginning of the dungeon without even seeing the entrance to it?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Where it used to have more sprawling dungeons and 5 man's that took hours to weave your way through, we're now in the age of LFG and more manageable dungeons to accommodate for players of all (most) types.<br />
<br />
You can tell they are focusing more on &quot;cool&quot; content and sectioning things off so it's easier for the player to grasp. I know this is dumbing down for many people, but it's easy to tell Blizzard has a lot more focus on the direction they want to go.<br />
<br />
I personally liked the sprawling large dungeons, but with the direction the game is going it doesn't make sense to keep them around any more, unfortunately. I guess it's good and bad. However, if I want a game with large, deep dungeons that are complex and take an hour or more to navigate, I'll play a different game that likely isn't an MMO at all.</div></div><hr />

I want non-linear raids, where I will be with non-morons. I want linear dungeons because having dumbfucks in PUGs argue about optional bosses, routes and getting lost gets very old the tenth time you do it.<br />

<br />
What a lame response. And your argument being irrelevent to the game. where did the girl enter the argument? you address the content issue with something totally unrelated. people choose to play instead of doing something else, your argument is play less, but the discussion is how to play not to play with a girl. then you yell at someone for being insulting, and you do worse. this is a forum to discuss WoW, what are you doing here?<br />
<br />
blizz admits to simplifying the content, but justifies it by claiming its what the majority wants and its fun and good for the game.... take talent trees for example. the majority of the players agree its simplified and railroading them into a spec, limiting the choices and options of how to play their class. I don't buy that its more fun, it isn't for me. maybe its more fun to not have to work so hard developing and balancing content. I disagree that its better for a player's perspective.</div></div><hr />

These dungeons are joke. If you want to have a quick game, load up Team Fortress or your favorite shooter. Chopping 2 levels out of ST? It wasn't that hard! Just have everyone stand at the stone and click it. You might have to double back on like 2 if you get the order wrong, but it is not hard! Not only are the dungeons getting shorter, you just have to visit them once and then you can magically teleport to them from anywhere in the world. The amount of lazyness from the developers is just getting out of control.<br />
<br />
The point of a dungeon is to explore and to get lost. I remember running around like crazy all over the place in Uldaman going up and down tunnels to get to the next part. Now it seems this is all gone...dungeons are a loot pinata: let's see how we can get to the end the fastest while skipping as much content as we can.<br />
<br />
Ah well, it was a good 4 years!</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree with a lot of what you've said, it has nothing to do with the perceived &quot;laziness&quot; of the developers. This is a common misconception unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Catering to the masses doesn't equal laziness. Sure, you might disagree with their somewhat new philosophy on WoW, but if anything Blizzard is at the top for a reason and it's not because they're lazy. Ask most other games studios; they might hate what Blizzard produces but they have a lot of respect for them. If you worked on video games, you'd understand. You might have a different opinion, yeah, but you'd understand.<br />
<br />
Laziness would mean the developers just doing whatever they see fit without constantly re-evaluating themselves, amongst other things.<br />
<br />
I'm not defending them, but even if they're developing things in the wrong direction, which they may be, laziness really is the wrong term to use.<br />
<br />
I do strongly agree with you and wish 5mans and other dungeons were more complex. Unfortunately the game is headed in a different direction.</div></div><hr />

This is a common misconception unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Catering to the masses doesn't equal laziness. Sure, you might disagree with their somewhat new philosophy on WoW, but if anything Blizzard is at the top for a reason and it's not because they're lazy. Ask most other games studios; they might hate what Blizzard produces but they have a lot of respect for them. If you worked on video games, you'd understand. You might have a different opinion, yeah, but you'd understand.<br />
<br />
Laziness would mean the developers just doing whatever they see fit without constantly re-evaluating themselves, amongst other things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yups in some cases it is more work for the devs because now they have to implement new systems to cater to the lazy and make two versions of a raid and tune them both to cater to the people who just expect to whine and get what they want. Every time there is a new debate of casuals vs hardcore the generally accepted level of what a casual is gets brought down to newer lows because people want to make the devs turn the game into how they want to make the game and now how the devs want to make it. <br />
<br />
And seriously why do people who want to play engaging content have to do a boring version of it first, just got get to the level they are and lose most of the new content feeling because they actually bother to apply themselves. Being held back by the QQ legion is not fun =/</div></div><hr />

There wasn't any chain pulling, and sometimes I even had time for a quick mana break. Removing the ooze section of ST I have no problem with but claiming these are excessive dungeons is a joke. Sure, there are options but those are pretty much ignored because the fastest way to clear the dungeon is always to head for the final boss.

Only 7 announced bosses. I don't believe they ever stated that what they previewed was the entire content of the patch. Of course it may be that it is all they have planned, but we won't know for sure until closer to the patch release. It's useless to speculate either way at the moment.</div></div><hr />

These dungeons are joke. If you want to have a quick game, load up Team Fortress or your favorite shooter. Chopping 2 levels out of ST? It wasn't that hard! Just have everyone stand at the stone and click it. You might have to double back on like 2 if you get the order wrong, but it is not hard! Not only are the dungeons getting shorter, you just have to visit them once and then you can magically teleport to them from anywhere in the world. The amount of lazyness from the developers is just getting out of control.<br />
<br />
The point of a dungeon is to explore and to get lost. I remember running around like crazy all over the place in Uldaman going up and down tunnels to get to the next part. Now it seems this is all gone...dungeons are a loot pinata: let's see how we can get to the end the fastest while skipping as much content as we can.<br />

Ah well, it was a good 4 years!<br />

<br />
Do you have anything more interesting to add to an intelligent, honest critique of the game? I wanted to see if it was worth coming back and I find out that Blizzard is hacking and slashing out content. During my hiatus, I've tried FF XIV, LoTRO, Runes of Magic, 4Story, etc. They stink compared to WoW.<br />
<br />
So, tell me where I'm wrong:<br />
<br />
We are getting no new continent/world<br />
We are getting a new profession called Archaeology that no longer provides any benefits<br />
Guild talents were scraped, even though they were interesting (replaced with guild &quot;benefits&quot;)<br />
Older dungeons/raids are getting nerfed/removed (Deadmines, SF, ZG)<br />
Newer dungeons are getting simplified/less complex (I like the cow analogy above)<br />
Gear is getting &quot;dumbed&quot; down (is it really that hard to figure out what piece gear is better for you?)<br />
<br />
Combine all that with the fact I already have seven level 80s and a bank character, an expansion dedicated to 1-60 leveling doesn't really do anything for level 80s, does it?<br />
<br />
Now, if they bought back a classic realm, say a level cap of 70, I would be all over that, since I didn't do all the raids in BC (basically just Karazhan and Zul'Aman).</div></div><hr />

Would you have seriously done the new ICC's if the stuff you got from it was worse then what you got from ToC/Ulduar? I personally wouldn't even have looked at it.<br />
<br />
Lore? Getting imersed with the story behind the raid you're about to get into? New fights? New places? Even a damn chain to earn you more &quot;emblems&quot; than you were supposed to get with the random heroic + raid for that week??<br />
<br />
I had way better gear than ICC5 could provide me (even if it was only item level comparision) and did the 3 places the same way. Nothing (except for a few items, generally trinkets) inside that could beat ToC25/ToC25H gear (258/245 &gt; random 232), but ppl did the place anyway...<br />

<br />
That means adding longevity to a content, wich isn't the case of WoW anymore. Content is now aimed for a player to be done with it very fast (like a few weeks in the case of leveling + dungeon/raid and 1, 2 weeks for just a new patch). They used to have the dream of a new expansion ($$$) per year, but that didn't worked out (yet).<br />
<br />
But I guess even the most hardcore fans of the former wow can benefit from this new philosophy. They can just do the content and logout of the game to do other stuff. Even playing more games (wich is bad for Blizzard, because some players can end up never comming back. Some of my friends ended up enjoying other MMOs or spending more time with their PS3/Xbox360 single/multiplayer games).<br />
<br />
I find it very sad that we don't have rare spawns (with some cool drops) anymore in the 5man for examplen. That was very cool in classic.</div></div><hr />
