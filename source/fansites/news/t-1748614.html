Patch 6.1.2 Hotfixes - March 31<br />

<br />
Armor Sets<br />
<br />
Tier-17 4-piece set bonus for Feral Druids should now correctly have a chance to trigger from Multistrikes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Legacy<br />
<br />
Striking Back (Dun Morogh): Repaired Bomber should now correctly fly over Ironforge Airfield and allow players to complete the quest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
<br />
Blackrock Foundry<br />
<br />
The Blast Furnace<br />
<br />
Phase 1<br />
<br />
Furnace Engineers should now throw a bomb at players roughly every 6 seconds. Throw Bomb is now instant-cast, but the range is now 40 yards (down from 50 yards). These changes are intended to diminish the relative benefit of having two or more priests, compared to one or none: Mind Control allows for more controlled targeting of the Bombs, but does not speed up the phase as a whole.<br />
Reduced the health of Heat Regulators.<br />
<br />
Blackhand<br />
<br />
Blackhand's health has been reduced by 5% on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Blackhand's Massive Shattering Smash ability now deals 25% less damage on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Iron Soldiers' health has been reduced by 15% on Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Collections<br />
<br />
Heirlooms<br />
<br />
In response to player feedback, we have increased the power of Heirloom for levels 91-100. This change is intended to help Heirlooms be more competitive relative to Draenor dungeon gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause Mistweaver Monks that had undergone a Paid Character Boost to deal less damage than intended while in the process of unlocking skills and abilities.<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause looping flight paths used for quests to not work correctly.<br />

A new Diablo III update (http://www.diablofans.com/news/48381-ptr-patch-2-3-datamined) went out last night, with some familiar features.<br />
<br />

With today’s patch we’ve introduced the next exciting chapter in the ongoing struggle for dominance of the Nexus: an entirely new game mode! So summon forth your steadfast allies, feed your favorite faerie dragon, and brace yourself for the unique challenges ahead in Big Head Mode!<br />
<br />
What is Big Head Mode?<br />
Variety is the spice of life in Heroes of the Storm, and we’re always looking for new ways to allow players to customize their Heroes and infuse their personalities into the denizens of the Nexus. Big Head Mode is just another step in that direction.<br />
<br />
Have you always wanted to see chibi Illidan face off against a kawaii Lord of Terror? Now’s your chance! This unique gameplay mode is automatically enabled the moment you step foot into your favorite Battleground, and features the same dynamic 5v5 combat you’ve come to know and love!<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-heroesHeads&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/march/thumb/heroes01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/march/heroes01.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/march/thumb/heroes02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/march/heroes02.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/march/thumb/heroes03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/march/heroes03.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
This is the pulse-pounding mode you’ve always wanted to play, but were afraid to ask for.<br />
<br />
Until now…<br />
<br />
Feature Highlights:<br />
<br />
<br />
Experience enhanced collision using Facecheck™ technology as you run headfirst into tall grass and bushes and scour for your enemies!<br />
An all-new set of unique character dialogue brings to life these familiar Heroes as you’ve never heard them before.*<br />
Get closer to your beloved Heroes and get a new perspective on your favorite Battlegrounds, just watch out for low-hanging branches!<br />
Be wary fighting against opponents who specialize in headshots. Just because your character has more innate charisma now doesn’t mean that Nova will show you any mercy!<br />
Bonus features: Many models have received HD upgrades to their heads and hair, adding increased size and fidelity to their brazen beards, majestic antlers, stunning mandibles, and more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don’t delay! You can log into Heroes of the Storm now and explore this new game mode firsthand. Please be aware that it will only activate once you have loaded in on one of the many diverse Battlegrounds of the Nexus!<br />
<br />
Share your favorite screenshots you’ve taken in Big Head Mode and let us know what you think of this fun new feature in the comments below. As always, make sure to keep an eye out for future developments, including the adorable Mini-Mount Mode**!<br />

Chaud really should have separated these out. The April Fools stuff is fine to post, but put them in a post by themselves so people don't confuse real and fake - not that it is really that hard to figure out.</div></div><hr />

I reaaally hope this is just another april's fool joke. We are super close to killing Blast furnace on mythic. Newsflash for you blizzard: <br />
<br />
The majority of the MYTHIC playerbase does not want to see ANY nerfs being made to MYTHIC content. We want it as hard as it is. Nerfing Blackhand and Blast furnace is beyond retarded. This isn't an opinion, it's a fact anyone can realize.<br />
<br />
We raid 8-9 hours per week. It is solely for that reason we are not yet finished with the tier. There are hundreds of guilds like ours that are filled with talented players, but do not have the luxury of spare time to raid more often. We will kill Blackhand soon enough.<br />
<br />
Want to nerf Blackhand and BF? Fine, do it in THREE MONTHS from now when only the guilds that are struggling to kill H&amp;F or Kromog have it unkilled. For those guilds it would be impossible without a nerf to kill such a hard boss.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Balance has been redesigned. The damage you deal is now variable, based on the current number of threads on the forums demanding nerfs or buffs&quot;<br />
<br />
The hunter seems fine makes me nervous, though, since these patch notes are April Fool's jokes. Makes me wonder what awful stuff they really do have in store for hunters. :)</div></div><hr />

The nerf was much needed. Now you dont have to rely on double rogue and stacking 700 boomkins/hunters. Unless you have done the fight yourself, i suggest you go read about it and why its abysmal right now</div></div><hr />

I have the kill already, scrubbie.<br />
Everyone who has experience with high end raiding knows that &quot;Bring the player, not the class&quot; means &quot;Have your players equip their alts, so they can bring the class.&quot; (for instance, no guild killed Lei Shen with less than 2 death knights).</div></div><hr />
