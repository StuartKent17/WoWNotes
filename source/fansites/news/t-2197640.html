We’ve heard a lot of feedback and it’s clear to us that the cyclical Assaults schedule, and the design of the “do all 4” achievement for Pathfinder, weren’t compatible.<br />
<br />
World Quests come and go all the time during the day too, while people are at work or asleep, and it’s not a big deal because they’re largely interchangeable. But that would change if we had an achievement required for Pathfinder that asked you to do a specific checklist of world quests. A lot of the stress and concern about “missing” individual Assaults is tied to this achievement, so we’re removing the achievement from Pathfinder via hotfix.<br />
<br />
Once this hotfix is active, you will only need to reach Revered with the Armies of Legionfall and fully explore the Broken Shore to earn Legion flying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2 Hotfixes - April 5<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
The &quot;Defender of the Broken Isles&quot; achievement is no longer required as part of the Legion Pathfinder, Part Two meta-achievement.<br />
<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: The rotating Legion Assault schedule is designed to have them active at varying times of day over the course of a given week, to accommodate different work schedules and available free time. We're hesitant to have an Assault last for too long, because they stomp on the entire World Quest content of a given zone for the duration, potentially leaving players with nothing to do there once the Assault is complete. But this design doesn't mesh well with an important achievement that requires completion of all four zones - if anything, it causes stress over scheduling and potentially missing specific zones during the cycle. The Defender achievement was never intended to be a major obstacle on the path to flight in the Broken Isles; its inclusion was more for thematic purposes and completeness. As such, we're removing it from the meta-achievement required to unlock flying.<br />
<br />
Artifact Challenges<br />
<br />
Arcane Mages can no longer use an immunity, such as Ice Block, to remove Arcane Biology.<br />
Fixed a bug that was preventing some players from being ported back to the mage tower when leaving the scenario.<br />
<br />
<br />
Assaults<br />
<br />
While the Assault in Azsuna is active, Prince Farondis should now be visible to eligible players in Farondale.<br />
Vile Soulwardens in Val'sharah are no longer hesitant to engage in combat.<br />
Spires of Dread can no longer suffer damage from players' AoE abilities, and they no longer turn to face nearby players.<br />
Jarod Shadowsong will now appear for players at the base of Black Rook Hold if they leave the terrace before completing &quot;Battle for Val'sharah&quot;.<br />
Drol'maz will now respawn even if his Dark Ritualists were not killed with him.<br />
Destruction of Fel Spreaders will now grant group credit for “Defense of Emerald Bay”.<br />
Fixed a bug where players were not receiving quest credit if they were in a raid group during the intro Legion Assault quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Broken Shore<br />
<br />
The Sentinax should no longer advertise that it is finished recharging when it hasn't.<br />
<br />

Upcoming change to Legionfall War Supplies<br />
One of the core mechanics of Broken Shore gameplay is that of acquiring Legionfall War Supplies to put towards constructing buildings, which in turn unlock various content and bonuses. Recently, we’ve begun to notice that some players have begun stockpiling their Legionfall War Supplies in order to use them at a later time. While this is fine to some degree, if it were to become a more widespread behavior, it could have severely negative effects on the rate at which buildings are constructed, thereby preventing those bonuses and content pieces from being made available.<br />
<br />
Therefore, on Thursday, April 6 at roughly 11 AM Pacific time, we’ll be applying a hotfix that will reduce the maximum amount of Legionfall War Supplies a player can stockpile to 1000. This will ensure that building construction can proceed at a regular pace, while still allowing you to keep hold of several turn-ins worth of War Supplies if you like.<br />
<br />
Note that, when this hotfix is applied, any Legionfall War Supplies you have over the cap of 1000 will be lost. If you’re currently carrying more than that, please make sure to turn those extra War Supplies in before Thursday.<br />
<br />

Brewmasters in 7.2.5<br />
going to be disappointed if I waste some of the effect on DoT overlap (if this does stack).<br />
Clarification: Purifying Brew will increase the direct damage of your next Breath of Fire by 50%. We don't want to beg the question of how the DoT interacts with mixing buffed/unbuffed BoFs.<br />
<br />
EDIT: And you will be able to Purify without any Stagger, to be clear.<br />
<br />
Usually, we don't discuss changes so early in the design process, but decided to try it out here. That's why I've focused so much on our thoughts and intent, not the exact changes we're planning, because planned changes are so ephemeral. <br />
<br />
Our design process is extremely iterative. We start with something and tweak it until it's as good as we can get. That means it starts out pretty rough, and solidifies over time into something better, and this discussion is a perfect example of what it looks like to peak into that process.<br />
<br />
Continuing this iteration process, listening to your feedback, and lots of internal discussion and testing, we're now leaning toward removing the Stagger cap. (To be perfectly accurate, changing it to an obscenely large value so that it still functions as exploit prevention. If you can get to 1000% Stagger... sorry, that's probably enough.)<br />
<br />
So there is basically two ways to &quot;nerf&quot; our ISB uptime.<br />
Nerfing Ironskin Brew uptime is explicitly not a goal of these changes. We have no current intention to do that. 100% uptime of ISB is totally fine right now.

<br />
Its probably got to do with the phasing; if you have it last the whole day; it means that you cant do the normal daily world quests in that zone while the invasion is still active ie the felwort and bacon quests popped up in the invasion zone the day before but you didnt do them, so you would miss out on those mats because the invasion was still active.<br />
<br />
Probably an easier way is to have the invasion last only 4 hours but have them 3 times in the zone per day, but if you have already done one of them in that zone that day the invasion zone is phased out for you ie its just the normal zone with the normal world quests; otherwise it would probably be an slightly broken way to farm nethershards.</div></div><hr />

All they needed to do was change their schedule .... but FFS, so far we've had 2 invasions and they were at 5am to 11am and 1am to 7am on the Oceanic servers. The schedule is retarded.<br />
<br />
Surely they could have made invasions last 24 hours, but phase it out for people who had completed the invasion in that zone. Everyone could have had a chance then.</div></div><hr />

Actually you CAN do everything you could before.<br />
<br />
Leveling players can participate and get good xp.<br />
Doing the quests GIVES you the rep for the zone.<br />

<br />
For a big patch, 7.2 feels so empty. And I think a part of that comes from the strict invasion schedule and the staggered quest availability. Doing one quest per week doesn't really feel like something fun, but rather just a chore to keep us paying. This &quot;solution&quot; just reveals that the developpers don't even play their own game. If they did, they'd know that all people want is to experience the new content, which they can only do at stupidly small periods of the day. Flying was a bonus for completing the new content. How hard would it be to make them either more frequent, or last longer, phasing out for people that already completed it? You know, like the pre-Legion event... Also, the Broken Shore feels so empty...I thought they meant for it to be a Timeless Isle kinda thing? Timeless Isle had something for you to do as long as you wanted to be there, now all you can do is just go under the Sentinax and pray to get the portals tagged for your group, just to get shards for a potential (very unlikely) legendary. <br />

As a sidenote, I understand that people needed to get a way to catch up and prepare for the new raid, but simply offering everyone the 54 old traits immediately at log in was a crappy move. It makes players that have played the game continuously feel punished for doing so. Why should I care to upgrade my weapon in 7.2 if they're just gonna give it to me as soon as 7.3 hits? Seriously, why is Blizzard so worried about what people that only play on patch week think? They should be more worried about their loyal players who've been paying every month.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted them to extend it to all day. I don't normally log in until 9 or 10pm pacific time due to work and life and all that. <br />
<br />
And I am a no lifer. <br />
<br />
Like I've got 5 alts, none of them in true raiding guilds but all at at least 875. <br />
<br />
I've been sad or angry just disappointed at how short a timer the invasions are on. They would be great for stocking up on shards and supplies while avoiding the aids that is broken shore - I've never cared much for the Timeless Isle style sandbox areas and would have preferred the zone just be added to the WQ cycle. <br />
<br />
If they'd made the invasions last for the entire time a zone is up then they could have avoided all the trouble.</div></div><hr />

Reschedule for you? There would always be some people it would hurt. So no matter what people would complain. They could have or should have just done it like pre-Legion invasions and had them come up several times a day, and increase the rate at which they do over time. Or something. But yeah, the tears. God forbid people had patience or played the game.

People weren't asking them to remove the achievement. We were asking them to fix the dang schedule so we could actually complete the dang thing. I barely got home in time for the first 1. I was at work for the 2nd, &amp; the 3rd is going to end up being around 2AM. There are people who haven't been able to catch a single 1 due to work. So get off your high horse since it's so obvious you're one of the people who had no trouble catching all 3.</div></div><hr />

Yes, and next invasion is in Highmountain starting at around 2AM PDT if you're in on the North American servers. And Highmountain will ALWAYS be at 2AM PDT on North American servers, next time on Sunday.</div></div><hr />

If you were &quot;farming&quot; Krosus Mythic, I suppose everyone in your raid already had 54 point prior to the patch? So it didn't actually make a difference, maybe you simply 2-shot it this time because people didn't screw up on the 2nd try instead of the 10th one? I'm sure next week it will be on a different try, might be on the 1st, might be on the 7th. If it's &quot;farm&quot;, it will eventually go down.<br />
<br />
As for alts, if you read what I said, I understand they have to speed up the catch up mechanisms, and I'm all for that. But simply giving them is dumb, especially for new characters (non-alts). It's stupid that new characters get 36 traits before even unlocking the 3rd relic slot.<br />
<br />
It's not about feeling better than other people, it's about feeling valued by the game you give money and time to.<br />
Imagine you were building a house by adding a new brick everyday because you're only allowed to buy one brick per day. Now imagine when you finish it, your neighbor buys one brick and instead gets a completely built house just like yours. <br />
Not that you'd want to be superior to your neighbour but it would seem very unfair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you're right. They should. Every single one of them should quit. I think it'd be enough people that maybe, just maybe Blizzard would notice. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately from what Ghostcrawler said, quitting doesn't work because there's enough people quitting all the time that it doesn't stand out. So you post on the forums and get ignored or they pull this crap where they fix the wrong thing (and that just proves how little they actually listen to the playerbase). On top of that, you've got to deal with all the people like you who aren't affected and therefore absolutely refuse to see why something could be a problem.</div></div><hr />

I have plenty of time. I easily clock 40 hours a week. Yet I have not been able to catch a single invasion due to the timings. And as I understand it, the invasion times are always the same, just on different days.<br />
Maybe I can get the nightly ones in a weekend some time, but it's retarded to even have to plan for this.<br />
<br />
I don't even wanted the achievement fixed, I wanted the invasions last longer, more often or at reasonable times. Bliz has logs of when people log in; they know they're screwing over millions of players this way.</div></div><hr />

I am not talking about rescheduling for me. I am talking about 12 hr. cycles. I guess one event in the morning and one event in the evening makes everybody happy. As you said, more like it was in pre-patch. My only hope now is that it is already made the way it was in pre-patch, and we will see the increase in amount of assaults per day in upcoming weeks. TBH I do not even care about flying that much. The whistle and large amount of flight points in the zones makes flying obsolete.</div></div><hr />

i dont see whats the big deal. achievements dont need to be made more accessible as flying isnt needed its a luxury prize for completing it. the wow community is so used to instant gratification it sucks. If you arent on often enough to be able to catch what like 4 invasions that you need for the achiev then you dont need flying that bad in the first place. Do invasions not have a chance to spawn when you play or is it fixed on once a day at the same time everyday</div></div><hr />

For example I remember when I entered Tanaris on my lock to do the entry quest for Uldum and Tanaris was under invasion, the quest giver wasn't there, but once I completed the scenario, everything returned to normal allowing me to quest the old fashioned way. Why not now?<br />

They made mistake, they are fixing it. I dont see the problem on taking it also.<br />
<br />
They did a mistake regarding the timing (Just finished a 20 minute assault on Stormheim that will expire in an hour) not regarding it being an achievement.<br />
Still doesn't solve the problem of people not being able to make as their daily commute not allowing as it is also a great way to gradually level your alts.<br />
<br />
I have rather a brutal commute but it has flexible hours, hence, except for my meetings at set times I can easily fit these in. But I also sympathize with people who does not have the luxury to do so and getting shafted for it. They should have opted for 3 invasions per day with 4-hour windows (Early Morning, Afternoon and Late Evening) to match players with different schedules.<br />

Aside from the initial one-time &quot;Defending the Broken Isles&quot; quest whose completion follows from an assault that you turn-in to Maiev, invasions don't give Armies of Legionfall reputation.</div></div><hr />

I would rather do the events but the way they have this current shit show running is pretty asinine.</div></div><hr />

Now iam glad they removed the requirement for flying cause i have jumped through enough hoops for that already and if i see people flying and being able to do things quicker but i cant cause i had to work when that highmountain invasion happened that would royally have pissed me off and yes flying is important to us whos time is limited cause flying makes doing WQs so much quicker and you need to keep up wit the AP grind.</div></div><hr />

Hardly that difficult, scripting the actual event would be no harder than changing the consistency of timing for event launch for the sake of latency issues, its bizzare to me, honestly.<br />
<br />
I was expecting this to be scripted to launch one invasion per hour per each zone.<br />
<br />
So this is news, infact it just sounds like sloppy scripting.</div></div><hr />

It's not really whining when its a legitimate complaint, <br />
<br />
If the events are specifically timed, and that gap is large, then some people such as myself get screwed over because we have to work 9-5. <br />
<br />
Some sort of fix was needed, don't get me wrong I wouldn't complain if they say, did a random invasion at 9pm every night, or substituted the achievement for something else, exalted instead of revered with the faction, or x amount of world quests etc.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this is a thing I only have seen in F2P games before, and not even in all of them. I know why I don't have access to some parts of the content - this is a thing of community demands and my lacking willingness to participate in such type of content (=all organised content) - but in case of invasions, being shut off due to schedule issues, is quite insane. I don't even bother with micro events because they are just too short to enjoy them. But having progress relevant content only last some hours a day at a time where people are at work, school or whatever, or expect them to cut their sleep time to participate, is shady business.<br />

I do not care about it being a part of PF2, I do care about the fact that a huge part of new content, the long-awaited Legion assaults are time-gated. And it's not like it was in pre-patch, it's much worse, to the point that many people just cannot do them. It's a good advice to do them on saturday, but I do not want to wake up early to do the event.</div></div><hr />

I think you didn't get the point. WQ's, just like the invasions can pop up and expire during your business-time or sleeping time, but is is OK for WQ's because there are many of them and once one expires, another one pops up. Missing like 300k AP or 100g or an item is a bummer, but it's not that big of a deal, compared to a fucking Legion invasion, which is supposed to be a big thing in this patch.</div></div><hr />

It's not as if getting flying was ever hard in the first place, just time gated. Getting to revered still takes longer than doing four invasions would have so nothing has really changed as far as how soon people will get it. I'm not really sure why people are mad about flying anyway, do they just hate flying and don't want anyone to have it, or are they upset that other people might get it before them?</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with casuals. There are people who have still not been able to do a single invasion because they have to be at work or school during the short time the invasion is up.

That's not true, just use your braincells, pretty sure you can figure it out why.....<br />
hint:&quot;World Quests all have different durations, with longer durations reserved for more challenging quests. They do not 'reset' at a certain time like daily quests.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leveling players can participate and get good xp.<br />
Doing the quests GIVES you the rep for the zone.<br />
What other stuff? Farming? Can still do it! RP'ing? Do it! <br />
<br />
You literally have no argument there with those points.<br />
<br />
They could also just, for example, give you the quest &quot;Legion Invasion: Stormheim!&quot;, and then you turn it in, the area becomes phased into the invasion. This way you can skip it if you feel like it.<br />
I woke up earlier today to catch the invasion and it was already over. If anything I'd like it if they kept one in the morning, and one in the evening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you also don't need to target specific world quest except the PvP ones for achievements, so in general, you always have enough world quests available if they don't bug like in the case of Kirin Tor WQs.<br />
<br />
With invasions, this pretty different, because there either is one or it is not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Problem is, if these invasions really interfere with the availability of world quests, then providing invasions for a longer time could lead to another shit storm - that people cannot do their daily emissay. Of course, you can postpone these, but if you have bad luck, then you always get an invasion in that area when you want to play, and cannot get anything done.<br />
<br />
I think that the suggestion to use phasing to get people into a phased version of an area with an invasion going on forever would definitively be the best thing. Think of it as a scenario with unlimited number of participants, or a limit like with the shard in the Pre-Legion event.<br />

Getting to revered still takes longer than doing four invasions would have so nothing has really changed as far as how soon people will get it. I'm not really sure why people are mad about flying anyway, do they just hate flying and don't want anyone to have it, or are they upset that other people might get it before them?<br />
<br />
I am not upset about flying, but I do think that it shouldn't be in the game at this point. Anyway, their decision is stupid one way or the other - invasions give 1500 rep so they are still, more or less, mandatory if anyone wants to complete pathfinder quickly.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that if someone wants to do invasions without caring about Pathfinder (like me, good nethershard source) then those people are screwed up even more.</div></div><hr />

Of course, you can postpone these, but if you have bad luck, then you always get an invasion in that area when you want to play, and cannot get anything done.<br />
<br />
I think that the suggestion to use phasing to get people into a phased version of an area with an invasion going on forever would definitively be the best thing. Think of it as a scenario with unlimited number of participants, or a limit like with the shard in the Pre-Legion event.<br />
<br />
invasion wq's count towards the emissary.<br />
<br />
they could also reduce the amount of time they're up for to like an hour and a half, like it was on ptr.</div></div><hr />

They aren't. We get 4 invasions in 72 hours. That means a 6 hour invasion followed by a 12 hour cooldown and then the next invasion.<br />
<br />
Times are MST:<br />
Azsuna 3-9 pm (April 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, etc)<br />
Val'sharah 9-3 pm (April 5th, 8th, 11th, 14th, etc)<br />
Highmountain 3-9 am (April 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, etc)<br />
Stormheim 9-3 am (April 6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, etc)<br />
<br />
For someone in a Monday-Friday school or job, that mean that they couldn't do Val'sharah until Saturday. If someone attended church on Sundays, then Highmountain might not be possible until the 15th. Stormheim could potentially be dicey but could be as long as the same 15th.<br />
<br />
Forcing people to miss work/school and/or lose sleep didn't make for a fair achievement. Should it have been removed from the meta? Perhaps not but Blizzard should have designed the invasions better. They have phasing tech. They could have used it while making the invasions last all day. Have a bronze dragon or a mage that let players phase into an alternate version of the zone not being invaded if they don't want to do the invasions and have the invasions phase out if you complete it.<br />
<br />
Funny how Blizzard says they didn't want it all day because it interferes with the normal world quests. Blizzard could have just had the original world quests begin to repopulate into a legion infested zone after you do the invasion but with the added flair of giving you legionfall resources on top of the normal reward. Would have given nice variety to getting resources instead of doing the same world quests over and over. But nope. That made too much sense.<br />

With that invasions uptime (first invasion timer), only the kids can do the events, because they have free time all day. Who have a normal life, working included, its impossible do that.<br />

I woke up earlier today to catch the invasion and it was already over. If anything I'd like it if they kept one in the morning, and one in the evening.<br />
<br />
It's a smart and the best decision.<br />
<br />
All they had to do was adjust the timing, or do what Pebbleton said. Massive over-reaction. You still got the 11week campaign timegate, so it's not like you needed to do them ASAP.</div></div><hr />

Well, congrats for being in a small part of the demographic where the schedule worked for you. Can't apply the same kind of logic across a large portion of the player base.

&quot;Oh no! The Legion is invading, quickly help Zonexyz!&quot; makes more sense if they are just there for a sort time, instead of things being like: &quot;Oh! I murderized them 4 hours ago and they are still there?&quot;<br />
They just cut the &quot;flying crowd&quot; from their complainers, instead of actually fixing the problem.<br />
<br />
All that aside, is there an actual reason besides giving the Legion a foothold that we defend the zones?<br />
Stormheim has Odin and his army, which was kinda the basic idea behind creating them. Now that Sigryn is Queen there shouldn't be a problem with the rest.<br />
Azsuna has ghost elves, Pirates, blue Dragons and some Illidari. The Dragons can fly away and the rest is kinda useless, except meybe the tiny Illidari outpost.<br />
Val'Sharah has a bunch of Nightelves including TWO that are now responsible for black-rook-hold (no wonder it's still fucked) and a wierd Human village. The dream is purified for the most part and Cenarius as well as Malfurion are free. So they should be able to fend for themselves?<br />
Suramar we just got done with.<br />
Highmountain is the only Zone I see actually worth defending, except maybe the very north.</div></div><hr />

That's a fucking stupid decision on Blizz's part. There's fuck all worth getting on alts with rep, why would I even bother sending missions on alts? This is correct btw, just checked the tokens my alts got from missions and they're bound.</div></div><hr />

It worked for me yesterday. It will work for you tomorrow or the day after that or during the weekend. For someone else it will work during the week that follows up. It would work out for everyone within a matter of two or three weeks.<br />

I however do agree that the way the invasions have been set up is just too random. There should be a way to tell when and where they'll strike.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like people have the ABILITY to raid if they want, they want to be able to at least TRY to do the invasions. With the way timing is set up, they can not even ATTEMPT to do it because the invasions have been happening they are at work or some other sort of obligation.<br />

Nope they didn't, that's why we were struggling and we had to even postpone it at start when we got there and progress Botanist first, because lack of traits. When we killed him, maybe 40% of the raid was maxed, rest between 47-53 traits depending on person, and then I think we had 2, maybe 3 rekills before the patch. Yes, during these 2-3 weeks people were getting closer to 54, doesn't mean they were 100% maxed by 7.2. It's a fact our kill timers are better after the patch, which can't be attributed to much else than the traits because 7.2 brought very few class balance changes. <br />
<br />
Also people should stop complaining about catch up mechanisms in wow. First, they existed since TBC and badge gear, so nothing new and surprising. Second, &quot;zero catch up&quot; design is horrible for new &amp; returning players, and in AP department, also for offspecs. <br />
<br />
I don't feel &quot;horrible&quot; because I gave up nolife AP grinding ages ago and just gather AP as they come from raids, emissarys and weekly share of m+. So I don't have to yell &quot;I've sacrificed everything for my AP, what have you given?&quot; The 36-54 points felt boring, unrewarding and an artificial block in progressing NH. Glad they're cut. <br />
<br />
<br />
It's stupid that new characters get 36 traits before even unlocking the 3rd relic slot. If someone prio'd OR / blood farming so he can buy the 25 ranks instead of finishing his campaign, that's his choice. You still need to pay all the 25 ranks if you aren't an alt with BOA tome, 500 OR per rank, before you can get the free 26. And the campaign is nerfed as well, missions only take 1h in 7.2 and WQ requirement got nerfed from 20 to 10. I think that should make all new chars unlock their 3rd relic super fast, the only &quot;annoying&quot; part is for die-hard solo players, because most campaigns require dungeons.</div></div><hr />
