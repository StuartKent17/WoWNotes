Grand Expedition Yak Mount Preview<br />
The Reins of the Grand Expedition Yak (http://www.wowdb.com/items/84101) are sold for 60,000 gold before any discounts in a small village called The Grummle Bazaar, just outside of One Keg in Kun-Lai Summit. The mount is similar to the Reins of the Traveler's Tundra Mammoth (http://www.wowdb.com/items/44235) in that it can hold up to three people, but has two vendors when you summon it. <br />
<br />
The Traveling Trader vendor will repair your gear and sell you food, water, a 14 slot bag (http://www.wowdb.com/items/60335), and campfire materials. The other vendor is an Arcane Reforger, which allows you to reforge your gear wherever you can mount! The animations aren't done yet, as there is no mountspecial or jumping animation, but you can get a general idea of how it moves in the video below.<br />

Water Strider Mount Preview<br />
Moving on, we take a look at the Water Strider color variations. Currently, only the Reins of the Azure Water Strider (http://www.wowdb.com/items/81354) is sold in game by the Anglers faction. It requires Exalted reputation and costs 5,000 gold before discounts.<br />

Thanks for the report! We’re aware of this issue and are in the process of applying a hotflix so that Arthas and company remain back where they belong.

<br />
One of the most impressive things design wise, is the attention given to the movement sound. It really 'feels' like a purposeful 'trot' as it moves along. Different from the Mammoth, though it appears to share the same animation noise when summoned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember seeing a post saying it was able to walk on water. It is a water strider. I'm just wondering if it will be able to go on land? At say the sea turtle land speed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chaud</div><div class="date">2012-05-26, 08:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember seeing a post saying it was able to walk on water.

<br />
The spell (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/127278-golden-water-strider) says 60/100% ground speed + Water Walking, so it is pretty safe to assume it will do both. It is compensation for the classes that don't get a glyph or skill to let them ride over water.<br />
<br />
<br />
it really is a great mount. One thing currently, the rider sits just proud of the seat and does not move with the up/down motion of the moving mount which is quite noticeable as the yak trots along and you kind of glide.<br />

I assume that will be fixed when the animations are done, just like it works now for the mammoth.</div></div><hr />

They move very fast (the animated movement that is not the forward speed) although there is no way to know if this is the same as mount versions.<br />
<br />
They also make a lot of noise which might be pretty distracting, though perhaps forgiveable for the utility of a water walking mount.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you. I don't have that kind of money either. That's the reason I can't afford the Mammoth mount. Prices are too expensive.</div></div><hr />

even more hurray that the mount is account wide. i have a mix of chars with different mounts, which is so annoying when u are passively aiming for the achieve as its shared around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like only a small fraction of the general wow population will kill heroic Ragnaros / do raid metas etc. The mount is made for people with a lot of money, not every Joe Blogs. <br />
<br />
I'm on probably 250kish, give or take - I don't really do anything but log in and raid these days and still make money, I think I dropped to around 170k buying mechanohogs for friends over christmas - it's not that bad a price even in this economic climate, let alone the inflation in MOP.<br />
<br />
If you still think it's too much, then go grab another mount, there are hundreds - most of them looking better than this one. Not everything is for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Requires level 40 to ride, no idea if there will be requirments needed to be met before being able to buy from the vendor yet. (there isn't any on Beta as far as I'm aware) though it is bought in Kun Lai Summit.<br />
<br />
As for being account wide, so far on Beta it doesn't seem to be, but again, maybe it's a requirment thing, or something else stopping it from being account wide yet.</div></div><hr />

Think of it as the yaks are the racial mounts for the Pandarens that stayed in Pandaria. While the Dragon turtles are the racial mounts for the Pandarens that left Pandaria on the Wandering isles.</div></div><hr />

I dearly hope that's not the final price for the dragon turtles.

<br />
Prices too high? Traveller mammoth was sth like 16k. Sandstone Drake around 30k. Makes sense the Yak is 60k - it allso kinda scales with the gold I keep ending up with from expansion to expansion. 5000 in Classic, 40 000 in TBC, 120 000 in Wrath, 250 000 now</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure its just a place holder. I'd imagine you could expect it to be roughly the same price as the other racial mounts. Also, where are you getting this $170 figure from? Right now. Battle chest (vanilla+bc+game card) $20. Wrath $20. Cata. $40. MoP should be around $50-60. Right now thatd be roughly $140. If you assume that Wrath will be added to the battle chest and Cata gets another price drop it'll put the price around $120.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was not really the question. When can my level 85 buy it? In LK you had to get to Dal to buy the mammoth. In Cata, there were a number of vendors that you had to be 84 and unlock the TH zone to get there. Can a max riding level 85 buy it immediately or are there zones to unlock? And if there are zones, is there a level requirement to them?<br />
<br />
grexly75 has the most info - best case you will need to be lock summoned to an 87+ zone.<br />
<br />
Nothing definitive re: if phasing will prevent the summons from working or if the vendor will be phased in once you get there. Is there vendor rep/friendship status to get before you can purchase it? Nor if the mount is account-wide or per-toon?</div></div><hr />
