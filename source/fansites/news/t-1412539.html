<br />
This may be obtainable when you pre-order the expansion, which could happen a couple months before the release... as a way to get people to put up money early for the expansion. I don't think they've done that before, but there's no reason why they couldn't.</div></div><hr />

Why is everyone still complaining about no flying until 6.1? Blizzard is putting patches in-game sooner nowdays. Is it really a big deal to wait two/three months to fly?</div></div><hr />

&quot;This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location&quot; means it's also a ground mount, assuming that the description doesn't change before it's finalized.<br />

<br />
Only problem is, when is the last time Blizzard handed out a mount to everyone (esp. a flying mount as cool-looking as this one) as an in-game reward after completing a simple quest or event? The animations and skin are on par with rare raid mounts or Blizzard store mounts so I doubt it's for the pre-expansion event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not even the worst part. The worst part is where they flatly stated that new content will be timeless isle type zones without flying. So not only won't you be able to fly until the first patch, you won't ever be able to fly in current content again.<br />
<br />
As much as I hated the &quot;You must run these dailies in order to unlock rep in order to unlock gear which you must then pay us valor points for&quot; in 5.0, at least I could fly while doing them. <br />
<br />
I don't want that system back, but never being able to fly in current content again? That's goddamned lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the CE mount is the only one to fly pre 6.1.... then I think everyone can agree that Blizzard is just in it for the EXTRA money... not for the normal fee. So the game could say goodbye to few million subs there and then.<br />
<br />
But the chance of this being a CE is less than nothing considering you wont be able to fly for the first few months. And two heads are just in your way while running.</div></div><hr />

I'm not against this idea, but why would a flying mount be the CE mount for WoD when we won't be able to fly in WoD till the first patch? I understand we could still be flying all over the old world and such, but no one who would be leveling in WoD would really be able to use their new fancy CE mount.

Summons and dismisses an Iron Skyreaver. This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location.<br />
<br />
Increases flight speed by 150%/280%/310%.<br />

<br />
The Iron Horde can be seen clearly riding on Chimera in footage from WoD released by Blizz. The fact it was an Iron Chimera made it obviously related to the next expansion (and i dont mean obvious in a &quot;omg fey dragon, next expansion must be emerald dream&quot; kind of way)<br />
<br />
As the chimera has been changed now to this bad boy, I'd imagine this is the flying mount of choice for the Iron Horde and we'll be seeing a lot of it in WoD. Chances are VERY good it will be CE mount.</div></div><hr />

LOL. No, their gift is gracing us with the option to buy tickets to Blizzcon. <br />

And then make it so you can't use it to fly anywhere that matters for a whole patch.<br />

You're behind on your info. You won't be able to fly anything anywhere that matters ever again. Flying will always be in outdated content from here on out.</div></div><hr />

They've implying pretty heavily that every new patch that will come out will be a new island or some such that we inexplicably can't fly on.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's actually doubly a shame for this mount. If this preview is anything to go off of, its flying animations (and the mount) look great, but its run animations look... stupid.</div></div><hr />

''Summons and dismisses an Iron Skyreaver. This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location.''<br />

It'll act like a ground mount when in a no-flying zone.<br />

Personally their statement about 'outdated content' sounds to me exactly the same as what's been going on, only with the possibility that once patched-in zone has become outdated we might be allowed to fly on it. Still can't fly on Isle of Thunder, but perhaps in WoD patched-in zones will become flyable in subsequent patches.</div></div><hr />

Its funny and all that Blizz is trolling us...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
... but why?<br />
<br />
I suspect something might happen in or related to Karazhan, but I'm very doubtful it will happen. I recall Blizz stating they wouldn't have any pre-expansion events nor any content patches between now and 6.0 so in the mean time I'll just sit and laugh at how Blizz trolls dataminers (or perhaps the people who look at sites like this for datamined information).</div></div><hr />

They just released a new mount. Yes we heard of the fey dragon I think before we heard of the bloodwing and the bloodwing was released not to long ago but I think it may be a little to soon for another blizz store mount. Granted this doesnt mean it will be available this patch if it is in fact going to be a blizz store mount, again we saw the fey dragon several patch before it got released. Now I do think the chimera mount looks pretty cool and I will probably get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's worth noting that even during MoP, no-flying in current content has only been the case in two patches. We could fly in current content in 5.0, 5.1 and 5.3. It's only been 5.2 and 5.4 where current content was unflyable, less than half of the expansion.<br />
<br />
So it's not like this is &quot;exactly the same as what's been going on&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Use your Eyes...that thing looks nothing like a proto-drake, nor does it animate like one. So no, not &quot;Another proto-drake model&quot;. The way it swirls and shoots forward tells ME that it has been somewhat based on the Sky-Golem model animations, and the wing animations and such = unique. Just because something stands on its wings when not flying it doesn't mean it's a proto-drake skeleton beneath it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You also forget that in WoD all models in the expansion are going to have that level of fidelity as a standard regardless. That specific one may be a one time only but if that is the case they will have plenty of re-colors that is almost a given.<br />

I also agree that they will probably enable flying after the first major patch, I also think that if they are smart they will let flying mounts that can also be used as ground mounts to glide when jumping off of ledges like slow fall, that would make for some fun platforming and still allow flying mounts to be relevant until patch.</div></div><hr />

but i don't understand why there are chimaeras on draenor... and it looks exactly like the chimeras in found in the stone talon mountains and ashara, only it's a better model. did the horde bring chimeras to azeroth?<br />
<br />
Orcs brought a lot of wildlife to Azeroth. Also I am sure plenty of creatures stumbled their way through the dark portal.</div></div><hr />

i'm think it's likely that the horde brought chimeras. there are guards on both sides of the portal who are charged with staying there and keeping watch, i doubt they'd allow anything or anyone through unless you're there on orders or have some kind of clearance.</div></div><hr />

This creature can be used for both with it having 4 legs /dog type of thing yet a chimera/drake whatever doesnt fit the bill seems as its sole purpose is to fly more than run....especially with a stupid size wing span.<br />

&quot; Electric Boogaloo can be appended to the name of a movie to indicate a sequel. This construction is somewhat dismissive of the original work and/or the idea of making a follow-up movie. The sequel may be real, planned, or imagined.<br />

<br />
It would appear that your ignorance knows no bounds.<br />
<br />
1. Not a reskin. It clearly doesn't even use the same animations as the protodrakes. Please for the love of all things holy, learn what a fucking reskin is - a reskin is when the EXACT SAME MODEL is used again and the texture (ie. colour/patterns) is changed. Eg, the red drake could be said to be a reskin of the bronze drake. So you are completely, and utterly, wrong. <br />
<br />
2. Blizzard is clearly just having a laugh - if you can't realise that &quot;Eclectic Boogaloo&quot; is them joking with us and actually think they're being serious, then there truly is no hope for you. Please, for all our sakes, leave the internet and do not come back. God knows the collective IQ of the internet could do with a boost.<br />

Care to explain how it's a protodrake reskin? It doesn't have any of it structures and the animation does not look like a protodrake. Its mostly chimera's animation. Plus the fancy engines stuff attached to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most likely a reference to the movie Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086999/). The game is full of references to real things with the names changed slightly in one way or another.</div></div><hr />

To compensate the &quot;no flying&quot; expansion.<br />
People are such whiners... <br />
<br />
Seriously though, the reason why they are not including flying at launch (and waiting until a future patch to add it) is that players don't need to experience the sky. They want people to experience the ground first, and then build their way up. It makes flying much more impactful and possibly a chance for gating content in a better way.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is also greatly improving the flight path system. Getting from A to B shouldn't be a problem.<br />
AND if you don't like flight paths, there's enough to do on the ground to forget flying mounts. <br />
<br />
Perhaps this is a chance for better quality zones that will attract you back to them for more than just:<br />
Gotta get to here, so I must fly over here. <br />
They don't want zones to be like Georgia when it was founded...a buffer.</div></div><hr />

Nuramoc: NPC= 20932 Rarespawn Chimaera in Netherstorm. Maybe he's the last of his kind and they were everywhere back in the day. Either way, there is one there now, so there's nothing to say they were never there before.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they've done that before, but there's no reason why they couldn't.<br />
<br />
See that I believe. That or the store. No way this has anything to do with WoD content or collectors edition. It looks like too much of a cash cow to limit to just CE and lets not forget we will not be able to use flying mounts in WoD till 6.1. To get this mount and not be able to use it in the new content for 4 months just doesn't sound right to me gang.<br />
<br />
My final vote is a store mount.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soeroah</div><div class="date">2013-12-05, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's worth noting that even during MoP, no-flying in current content has only been the case in two patches. We could fly in current content in 5.0, 5.1 and 5.3. It's only been 5.2 and 5.4 where current content was unflyable, less than half of the expansion.<br />
<br />
So it's not like this is &quot;exactly the same as what's been going on&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's also worth noting that we STILL can't fly in those areas, even 5.2's, even after they are no longer 'current'. The phrasing used in the Tweet sounds like they might be changing that system.<br />
<br />
And it is 'exactly the same as what's been going on', insofar as that every time a new zone has been patched in it's been flight-locked. Yes, you could still fly in 5.1 and 5.3, but those were old zones that were updated. I sincerely doubt Blizzard is going to release patch 6.1, allow us to get flying, and then instantly disallow it in Draenor outside of whatever new zone they may implement in that patch. Even if they don't patch in a new zone in 6.1, I still doubt they'll then re-deny flying in Draenor as a whole in 6.2 if they add a new zone in THAT patch.<br />
<br />
It'll most likely be the same way each tier was 'nerfed' in Pandaria after the new tier came out. Old content is made flyable in most cases, while new content is still 'difficult' (no flying).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah so in essence, we still can't fly anywhere that matters<br />
<br />
<br />
You're telling me after 5.1 came out you never went anywhere in Pandaria proper? :/ Not on your main, not on alts?</div></div><hr />

Flying will only be disallowed until 5.1, a relatively small portion of the expansion. Additionally there are 5 other continents still in the game where you CAN fly on your collector's edition flying mount. Doesn't seem like a big deal to me. As long as the mount they give us can ALSO be used as a ground mount it seems fine.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, so it sounds like if any new content is added to Draenor proper, we will still be able to fly, but if any new zones are added, we won't be able to fly in them.<br />
<br />
Basically, the same as in Pandaria. It's possible I'm missing a tweet where they confirm they'll be actively taking away flying rather than denying its use in new areas each patch though. Link me if I am.<br />
