Blizzard finally commented on the Raid Finder Loot exploit resultingin multiple accounts suspensions in a lot of guilds. <br />
Shortly after patch 4.3 was released, we became aware that some players were abusing an exploit to obtain loot from the same Raid Finder bosses multiple times in a single raid lockout period (one week). The Raid Finder loot mechanic is of course intended to only allow a person to roll on boss loot drops once per raid lockout period. The raid lockout mechanic has been a mainstay of the World of Warcraft rules since Onyxia and Molten Core, ensuring that no one can obtain loot from a boss more than once per lockout. Due to the nature of the exploit and the clear intent of those who abused it, they've been issued notices and given temporary suspensions from the game. Weâ€™re also working to remove all Raid Finder items from those who used the exploit. <br />
<br />
It's also worth noting that Paragon posted an apology on their website (http://www.paragon.fi/news/lfr-apology)<br />
<br />
An LFR Apology<br />
There has been a lot of misinformation going around, so to clear things up, here is a truthful account of what exactly happened with the LFR and what we have to say about it:<br />
<br />
The patch hit EU servers on Wednesday. We started off with our 5x Firelands runs to wrap up legendaries and called it a night. For Thursday, we had an elaborate plan to run a personal LFR raid for every main character to get the maximum amount of loot.<br />
<br />
As we were doing the first few runs, we noticed an unrealistic amount of tier pieces on some guilds' armory profiles, which we thought was unattainable through normal means. We started looking into it, and found out that you can loot passed gear from bosses, regardless of save status, if you zone out and back into the instance. This did not provide the raid with any extra loot, but it did eliminate a major portion of the RNG that would have been involved in simply doing personal runs for everyone.<br />
<br />
We acknowledge that using this unintended behavior, which was quite clearly a bug, to our gain, was wrong. The fact that others were using it as well is no justification for doing it ourselves. We apologize for doing it, and accept whatever consequences follow.</div></div><hr />

I don't see that happening, especially considering they weren't the only top guild who were exploiting and have received temp bans.<br />

There's your answer. New 2pc/4pc bonuses, itemisation, and socket bonuses can add up to quite the upgrade. Item level does not mean everything, it's just a measure of how many stats the piece is allocated not what the actual stats are.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">topfer</div><div class="date">2011-12-06, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If there was any doubt that the fuss over world firsts was even worth it, let it be made clear. This isn't the first time a major 'world first' guild got busted for an exploit. There is no sense of sportsmanship from guilds like Paragon, and that pretty much invalidates any contest for a &quot;world first.&quot; It really shouldn't be news anymore, because it's become less about skill and more about PTRs, mods, and exploits. The sense of competition here is void.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was about trinkets and tier only. Trinkets have never worked the better ilvl is better so there were definitely some trinket upgrades or situational trinkets to be had. As for tier, some of the 4pc tank bonuses would likely come in handy for progression and having full t13 even at ilvl 384 would allow them to seamlessly switch from t12 to t13 without that period of time running 2x 2 set bonuses. They likely wouldn't use 4 set 384 over 4 set 391, but when they get a couple of heroic t13 pieces, switching the last two 391's to 384's and getting your 4 pc will likely be a dps increase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it's Paragon ruining the competition with alt raids and class stacking, when every single top guild is doing the same thing because that's pretty much the only way to keep up (eg Blood Legion's 5 weekly Firelands clears for maximising legendaries and Four Horsemen requiring half a dozen warrior tanks)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just cannot agree with that. I could have gotten away with that statement. ALL of my friends in this game could have gotten away with that statement. But Paragon is probably the best PvE guild in the world. They're going to do virtually everything they can to keep it that way. When they see that other people are taking advantage of a bug that could give them a decent enough edge to get a world first, they're going to take it. And so, if I were leading Paragon, that would have been my reply to Blizzard. &quot;We do everything we can to remain the most competitive PvE guild in the world. If other people are taking advantage of a bug that Blizzard should have gotten fixed on PTR, then we're going to do the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
It kind of reminds of people taking steroids in Major League Baseball. By the time the era was at an end, you had so many players saying that they were doing it just because so many other people were as well, and they didn't want to lose their edge in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it would be a well-earned world first. IMO, I think Blizzard should -- if they can -- go look at all the other progression kills that these guilds have been doing and check over the exploits....<br />
<br />
Oh that's right. They have. This is just the first time Blizzard actually banned these guilds for it (Magmaw bug, Freya trash buff, AQ40 hijinks, ect.)<br />
<br />
I think that after all this time, a lot of those top guilds have enough members that have ranked up enough &quot;whoops was that a bug ho ho&quot; moments that they should be sporting permabans.<br />
<br />
Cheat-loving failures can sit there and laugh at Blood Leigon / Vodka getting world firsts, but the vast majority of us will cheer them on, because they got to where they are legitimately, by playing the game with skill and not scrounging for exploits like bads.</div></div><hr />

I agree, there is money to be mad,e fame to be had, and a lot of publicity surrounding World Firsts within the WoW game. So yes, it *does* have an impact on the playerbase.<br />
<br />
I for one, don't particularly want the *best* players in the game/hobby I have being nothing more than cheats.

You really don't understand the definition of Exploit do you? It's a multi-million dollar game, there are bound to be bugs and exploits to find. By taking advantage of it, they violate the ToS, simple as that.<br />
<br />
You find an exploit, you report it. Or face the consequences as many top guilds have.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kronicles</div><div class="date">2011-12-06, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One must wonder if they did this exploit on their real main character's account. I think it's safe to assume that they know the consequences of cheating, and they also know that when new content comes out that Blizzard keeps an eye on the top guilds, invisibly. Therefore, it's logical to conclude that they did not do this on their main character's account. Furthermore, given the amount of money and time that they invest in this game, one can safely conclude that they have more than one account. If Blizzard were to ban them it would not make a difference because they have characters in the same gear as their mains on different accounts, so they would just log on those accounts and raid.</div></div><hr />

Cheating is wrong and using the excuse that you needed to do it in order to be competitive is never right.

No. It is in the terms of service that if you find a bug, you report it. If you don't it is an exploit.<br />

He wasn't trolling me, he was trolling the people in the forum who were saying their gear had been taken away. This was before the suspensions were handed out and before Blizzard started stripping them of the gear they obtained through the exploit. It just show the arrogance these players have and they could care less they cheated, thus, the apology doesn't mean shit, just trying to save their asses.</div></div><hr />

Trinkets have never worked the better ilvl is better so there were definitely some trinket upgrades or situational trinkets to be had. As for tier, some of the 4pc tank bonuses would likely come in handy for progression and having full t13 even at ilvl 384 would allow them to seamlessly switch from t12 to t13 without that period of time running 2x 2 set bonuses. They likely wouldn't use 4 set 384 over 4 set 391, but when they get a couple of heroic t13 pieces, switching the last two 391's to 384's and getting your 4 pc will likely be a dps increase.<br />
The tier sets for this patch are quite powerful, and they nerfed some of the previous tier pieces to ensure that people wouldn't hold out upgrading. As an elemental shaman, my 2pc was nerfed from incredibly powerful to almost useless, and the 4PC is only a minor dps increase (although it was fun being able to jump around and move 95% of dps time as a caster).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just cannot agree with that. I could have gotten away with that statement. ALL of my friends in this game could have gotten away with that statement. But Paragon is probably the best PvE guild in the world. They're going to do virtually everything they can to keep it that way. When they see that other people are taking advantage of a bug that could give them a decent enough edge to get a world first, they're going to take it. And so, if I were leading Paragon, that would have been my reply to Blizzard. &quot;We do everything we can to remain the most competitive PvE guild in the world. If other people are taking advantage of a bug that Blizzard should have gotten fixed on PTR, then we're going to do the same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
It kind of reminds of people taking steroids in Major League Baseball. By the time the era was at an end, you had so many players saying that they were doing it just because so many other people were as well, and they didn't want to lose their edge in the game. So, you're saying that since other people cheat in a game, others should cheat as well to stay competative? That's just terrible. Just because those MLB players were never caught, doesn't make it less deplorable. I have zero respect for those who knowingly cheat the system. Yeah, got it, the top guilds who exploited and then banned probably still would've been on top even if they didn't cheat. But, they did. It creates a disgusting and unhealthy competition environment when all you do is look for ways around the system. Do it right and earn it. By Paragon taking full responsibility and accepting punishment shows maturity from them. They don't blame anyone else, and the shouldn't. <br />
<br />
One of my first Sergeants told me when I joined the Army: &quot;If you can look at yourself in the mirror, tell yourself you gave it your all and you did it with integrity, then no one can hold you back. If you can't then, you need to man up and do it right.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I agree completely with this. There are a bunch of jaded fanboys out there that try to stick up for the guild they like as if it's a sports team they're cheering for. Cheer for the ones that get stuff done legitimately without any kind of bug exploits, not the ones that cheat their way to the top.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty impressed with guilds like Blood Legion and Vodka to be honest, not using this exploit when they knew it was there and that they would likely need it to compete properly. Kudos to them for being fair and I hope they do well in the coming weeks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gritalian</div><div class="date">2011-12-06, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Does their cheating affect you? Why can't people play this game for their own amusement? Who cares how many guilds exploited, they will get their punishment and it will affect you exactly 0%. All these people saying glad they got suspended or glad they got their comeuppance are just being silly. 99% of the people who play wow do not care, will not care, heck most do not even know who paragon is, nor do they care. It's a game, have fun playing your game. If your game is made better by other people's misery, then you need a new game.<br />
<br />
It's similar to Tournament Theory. Paragon is at the top, they are promoted as the best guild, which in turns creates an environment where 10,000 guilds strive to play at that level where reality is maybe 10 guilds actually have that possibility. But as such, it creates a sense of competition that is then applied to servers, where you have guilds who finish weeks if not months behind Paragon, yet are competing against guilds on their server for server firsts.<br />
<br />
Paragon is the figurehead for competitive raiding, as they are on the top. Raiding guilds striving to be first just on their server are influenced by the best guild(s) in the world. It's the same way kids in little league look up to MLB players. Then you find out that the guild that inspires you to perform better is cheating and taking short cuts, and it kind of diminishes what they are all about.<br />
<br />
If they are cheating for LFR gear, you have to question what other tactics they've used in the past. Ensidia fell out of favor with the WoW community when using the saronite bombs on Lich King, I imagine this will result in the same for Paragon.</div></div><hr />

I feel I shouldn't apologize because being the top guild means competition and that's basically why we must take of advantage of every opportunity.&quot; If Blizzard can't manage the problems they see they shouldn't be punishing others for it simple as that. Luckily I didn't do the LFR but actually did a real raid in my ten man, and surprisingly normal Dragon Soul is a lot simple than Firelands.

This is blatantly wrong. Their gear doesn't effect me, but the fact that they cheated forced blizzard to use resources to clean up the mess. Everyone who exploited this cost Blizzard money and, being that I pay Blizzard, cost me money. Whether that shows up in slightly more expensive product, or slightly less money spent by Blizzard on other areas of the game, it still effects me. It's like arguing insurance fraud doesn't hurt anyone. Companies have margins and will maintain those margins by passing cost to the consumer or cutting internal costs. All subscribers pay for this kind of cheating. I support the ban for this reason, not because I care who gets world firsts, or what shiny pixels someone half way across the world has on their toon.</div></div><hr />

Its just sad that the high end guilds feel that they need to cheat in order to remain in the company of World of Warcraft elite. How many celebrities, in game or out, have cheated their way to the top? If anyone can give me a serious number on that.. I'll give you a cookie. Regardless... they made their bed and now they're gonna lie in it. Your reputation is only as good as your last performance, and this self inflicted cheater's brand will last for while whether their apology was sincere or not.

Tbh, you are rather retarded (that's not an insult at you btw). if you think they are tainted because of this incident. People cheat in life all the time, just to get ahead, it's called taking advantage of your chances and hope nobody finds out.

You have a valid point. World first's in a video game mean crap to the world at large, but to the people trying for them it matters. If something matters, then cheating to get it devalues what you're doing.<br />
<br />
To use a sport's analogy, you could cheat and break the course record in golf and write down that you shot 34 under on your score card, but you'd be deluding yourself if you think you actually accomplished something.<br />
<br />
For people who only want loot and understand that getting loot in a video game is simple fun, then yeah, they might have done it, but if you're gonna call yourself professional and treat something like a sport and want it to have meaning you play by the rules.</div></div><hr />

Software is impossible to deliver bug free. It is just too complex. To use a simple example, for every predicate in a program there are 2 paths. So for a program with 30 predicates, there are over a billion distinct executions that can happen. There are probably more on the order of 10,000+ predicates in software as large as WoW. It's a miracle anything gets done.</div></div><hr />

They bot, they exploit, they do anything to get an advantage. There's been an entire bot network consisting of one AH bot fed by several farming/crafting bots on my server now for almost a year that is run by the top guild on the server. The reason everyone knows is that this guild is dumb as rocks when it comes to covering their tracks. They leave the AH bot logged in 24/7 and all their alts are named as obvious variations to their mains, and those some of those alts are in the same guild as the bots. I've seen this on several servers now. I wouldn't be surprised if top raiding guilds are just responsible for the bots on a server as the gold farmers are.</div></div><hr />

I doubt that is the way blizzard has intended it to be.. Any thoughts?<br />

The Raid Finder loot mechanic is of course intended to only allow a person to roll on boss loot drops once per raid lockout period. The raid lockout mechanic has been a mainstay of the World of Warcraft rules since Onyxia and Molten Core, ensuring that no one can obtain loot from a boss more than once per lockout. Due to the nature of the exploit and the clear intent of those who abused it, they've been issued notices and given temporary suspensions from the game. Weâ€™re also working to remove all Raid Finder items from those who used the exploit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jayremy</div><div class="date">2011-12-06, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's similar to Tournament Theory. Paragon is at the top, they are promoted as the best guild, which in turns creates an environment where 10,000 guilds strive to play at that level where reality is maybe 10 guilds actually have that possibility. But as such, it creates a sense of competition that is then applied to servers, where you have guilds who finish weeks if not months behind Paragon, yet are competing against guilds on their server for server firsts.<br />
<br />
Paragon is the figurehead for competitive raiding, as they are on the top. Raiding guilds striving to be first just on their server are influenced by the best guild(s) in the world. It's the same way kids in little league look up to MLB players. Then you find out that the guild that inspires you to perform better is cheating and taking short cuts, and it kind of diminishes what they are all about.<br />
<br />
If they are cheating for LFR gear, you have to question what other tactics they've used in the past. Ensidia fell out of favor with the WoW community when using the saronite bombs on Lich King, I imagine this will result in the same for Paragon.<br />
<br />
If so why should lowbie players be getting week long bans for it then, they play to their own means, not some competitive ladder.<br />
<br />
I know wtf an exploit is and the ToS, I already known Blizzard has rights and control over everything I just disagree with it ALL.<br />
<br />
I think its a stupid concept to excuse themselves for their mistakes but say &quot;fuck all you guys, for being tempted by raining money (aka loot)&quot;<br />
<br />
I think the most moral fair way, is to remover gear all gains from it, then start everybody off fresh like it never happened. When both parties are at fault, not one side should be punished while the other can sit back comfortably. Besides I am pretty sure this bug has been reported, there are millions of players they are just being the big ol Blizzard they are people keep saying it like its some secret that NOBODY else would figure out. A bug like that is quite 'in the face' of players not something you go out of your way to do or grief people by any extreme manner, that requires research, timing, scripts or hacks.</div></div><hr />

The way you distribute loot in LFR doesn't matter, it only matters if you loot a boss and don't get locked to it and can loot the same boss again.<br />
<br />
You are perfectly allowed to queue with 25 raiders and award loot as you wish ONCE a week PER boss.</div></div><hr />

You know ALL I see if QQing about this exploit. Yes they did something wrong so did everyone else in the top guilds(not all). I trust blizzard when they say they will fix this been with this game for so long and I have had issues and stuff but they always fix it. I think everyone should just back off what done is done. They got banned for a bit and they will learn their lesson. They and other guilds will come back on top like always. Even tho on there site they did say sorry I do agree it does not make it right what they did. <br />
<br />
<br />
An exploit, in video games, is the use of a bug or design flaw by a player to their advantage in a manner not intended by the game's designers.[1] It is often colloquially abbreviated sploit. Exploits have been classified as a form of cheating; however, the precise determination of what is or is not considered an exploit can be controversial. This debate stems from a number of factors but typically involves the argument that the issues are part of the game and require no changes or external programs to take advantage of them.<br />
<br />
That is the meaning of exploit. So for all you retards do not do it .....Happy gaming;)<br />

My post that you quoted was responding to someone who asked why people care what paragon does, stating that what they do doesn't affect anyone elses enjoyment in the game. Which I find false. While it's not paragon specifically, the top raiding guild, which happens to be Paragon, inspires several competitive raiding &quot;markets&quot; beneath them. That's my only point.<br />

<br />
Yes, you make a good point. Regardless, they still broke a term of service, and should be punished for it. Furthermore, I don't really think it matters who forced them to make an apology. The fact is, they made the apology after Blizzard reported this, they had plenty of time to do so before everything went public, thus proving that they are not truly sorry for cheating and not following the rules listed in the terms of service.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People reported it during the ptr, blizz still didn't fix it till it turned into a real problem 5 days after it hit live servers.<br />
<br />
They said not to use the exploit, blizzard has way to much trust in its community if they really thought there statement was gonna stop people from doing it.<br />
They should have delayed the patch a week to fix the problem like they say they do for other issue's that come up, that's why they normally don't give release dates.<br />
Looks like someone dropped the bal here.<br />
Sure its not all Blizzards fault but Paragon or other guilds don't make the game Blizzard does.<br />
<br />
It's not Blizzards fault these guilds cheated but it is there fault the bug was there in the first place, they were told months before 4.3 went live.</div></div><hr />

It's a game...go take your &quot;world firsts&quot; to a job interview and see if they respect you for it. Get a life people, you need to rediscover what &quot;game&quot; means.<br />
<br />
The same thing goes for professional athletes, then.<br />
<br />
It's just a sport. Why should people care? Why should the players care? They're getting their paycheck, why should they bother putting the effort into playing? Winning the Stanley Cup / Superbowl / World Series is really just a title, doesn't actually matter. They're just too lazy to get a real job, and their fans are a bunch of losers with nothing better to do with their spare time than enjoy watching their team.<br />
<br />
You could say that about nearly anything in the world, if you really want to be that cynical about it. <br />
<br />
People enjoy watching those at the top of the game; any game. Gives them a sense of direction with their own skill development, and hell, entertainment is entertainment.<br />

&gt;1% cares what &quot;top guilds&quot; do. They are not front page news for anyone. The banning of people, and the slap on the wrist they got is news. They should have got a harsher ban, i would have banned the accounts. They knew what they were doing was against the eula, but they did it anyways and admit. These people will not get banned, just like gold farmers will not get banned. Blizzard thinks these people are important to fanboys, so they will not ban them. I am sure most people commenting about this guild specifically have also posted against the people complaining about cata and wow. Only true hard core &gt;1% ers care about this. The fact they got banned for exploiting is news, who did and why you care specifically about them, is not.</div></div><hr />

They have the ptr to test to try to get the game as bug free as they can before it goes live. EVERY GAME has it's bugs, even more so in the types of games that has content patches. This sort of thing is to be expected. Except there's still no excuse for anyone since you can still report bugs on live just as easily as you can on ptr. Exploiting this and getting a ban is as common sense as drawing unemployment while employed and going to court for it. Blizzard has some of the best customer service of any game company around, especially in the line of MMOs and as far as MMOs go with bugs, they do by far the best job of making sure there are as few as possible and getting them fixed in some way quickly. If this was any other MMO then you wouldn't see a quick fix after a week. You would see people exploiting the bug for probably at least a month and then run the risk of a server roll back that effects everyone.</div></div><hr />

I agree. People are freaking out and begging for them all to be permanently banned.<br />
<br />
Everyone should mind your own business. Remember back in the day when some of the PvP gear was bugged and you could buy it all from the vendor without the required points or rating? It was a great feeling to do it even though the loot got removed, BUT EVERYONE WHO GRABBED THE FREE LOOT SHOULD BE PERMA BANNED!!!!!!!!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

conspiracy theory? everyone new about this bug during the PTR.<br />
<br />
<br />
For all we know in another build they tested internally showed that the bug was corrected<br />
<br />
So why didn't they delay the patch to fix the problem that was there during testing months ago? they have done that with other patches in the past when &quot;unforeseen&quot; issues came up.<br />
<br />
Like i said i don't think it was right to cheat, all the guilds that did are wrong. But saying its not Blizzards fault as well the company that makes the game, that says when a patch is released, that tests its patches and has people report bugs is very hypocritical.</div></div><hr />

No we don't. The exploit was clearly part of ptr, they want us to test and they don't even look for exploits.<br />

Most of you have never and will never be in their shoes and how dare you lift your hammer of Internet Morality at them. Let's clarify some things here.<br />
<br />
They (the guilds using this exploit) knew what they were doing and they knew it was cheating. They knew this. From the begining. They aren't sorry for doing it and I wouldn't be either. It was a competitive play call that they (at least in Paragon's case) even hoped would result in some form of action. It was either going to turn out one of two ways. A) They get away with it and the race continues or B) They get caught and everyone doing so would be held back. It really was a win-win for them regardless. <br />
<br />
Now, I know it's hard for you anoynomous peoples to project into that situation, but at least try and see why they did it instead of damning them for doing so. They made the right call for their motives/goals. Was it wrong? Yes! Yes, it was. But when you have the pressures of sponsorship, fans, community sites and other elements at your back the moral high ground, as it were, is veiled in a bit more fog than you might think. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying what they did was the -right- thing to do, but it was the right call for the circumstance and ultimately they got what they wanted anyway.</div></div><hr />

If you give a crow an intricate puzzle for the crow to do to get the food, but then have a quick hatch on the opposite side that gives instant access to the food, the crow will quickly choose to use the hatch as it is an easier option to success. Doing something like the above is no different, people found an easier way to get the loot, it wasn't supposed to work like that, but you cannot ban people for finding an easier alternative to the puzzle.</div></div><hr />

You don't care about his Rogue but you don't speak for everyone else. I don't give 2 shits about Paragon and agree that this didn't need a to be on MMO-Champion.

Not really. The fights go the same way every time, so it isn't a sport. If Deathwing did some random new moves each time you fought him, sure, it might be a sport. However, fighting a boss on the PTR so you know how to do it then doing it on the normal realms is hardly an accomplishment.</div></div><hr />

They need to start disallowing people from PTR, especially people who got an in-game ban from the game. <br />
<br />
People who weren't eligible for the Annual Pass should also be disallowed because they don't have a good standing. &quot;Oh but I just started playing&quot; -- people who just started should not be worried about what's going down on the PTR. <br />

obvious, don't cheat on the last boss of a dungon (for ex Lich king, 0 guardingans yogg saron, queen vhaj bug)<br />

but stacking a class witch is extremely good in a fight is ok (aka nefarion, rag, 0yogg)<br />

you can use cheap tactics on non end bosses (the blind dragon, freeze guy in ulduar)<br />
<br />
and you can't exploit a game system (aka raid finder bug, tag killing)<br />

I want you to write a small browser-based RPG that has absolutely nothing wrong with it. Give it a week.<br />
<br />
When you come back with a mangled piece of junk, I want you to think about building a game of this magnitude and ensuring that every single character of code is flawless both during internal and external testing. <br />
<br />
During a VB programming course ( I know, I know D: ) I had written an interactive ordering system for a small restaurant; I couldn't get the damn thing to run. According to both professors, there was nothing conceivably wrong with what I had written. It just decided that it was tired of my shit, and wasn't going to run.<br />
<br />
Something that was maybe a few hundred lines of code was being stubborn. Can you imagine something with millions of lines of code? Elements in something that complex can interact in ways that you could never EVER predict.</div></div><hr />

Just because a door is left open, doesn't make it acceptable to walk thru and take what you want. It takes character and integrity to walk past, even if you see everyone else running in and looting. If you know something is wrong, you should have the balls to say I'm not going to do it, even if those around you are. Paragon failed at this and the price they are paying is fair.<br />
<br />
On a separate note, I wouldn't be at all surprised if their apology was part of some sort of plea agreement with Blizzard to get their suspensions reduced to 3 days from 8.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you come back with a mangled piece of junk, I want you to think about building a game of this magnitude and ensuring that every single character of code is flawless both during internal and external testing. <br />
<br />
During a VB programming course ( I know, I know D: ) I had written an interactive ordering system for a small restaurant; I couldn't get the damn thing to run. According to both professors, there was nothing conceivably wrong with what I had written. It just decided that it was tired of my shit, and wasn't going to run.<br />
<br />
Something that was maybe a few hundred lines of code was being stubborn. Can you imagine something with millions of lines of code? Elements in something that complex can interact in ways that you could never EVER predict.<br />
<br />
Then ban everyone who finds out something went wrong. If nobody knows, it will be 100% flawless!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maxemiss</div><div class="date">2011-12-06, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, Paragon should pay the consequences just like everyone else. But knowing Blizz they will lift their suspensions just because they are a known guild that are some of the best of the best. Just as they did with Swifty, he broke the rules I saw him break the rules and he got his ban lifted just because he made a video whining how he didn't break the rules and his followers threatening about it as well. When those of us who saw and were there know he did. <br />
Blizz is about the money not the community, Ruinious of Kil'Jaeden have said multiple times on KJ Blizz forums posted that they intentionally crash the server on Tuesdays by going into Org killing Garrosh, and AoE'ing the crap out of everything. Their excuse is encouraging world pvp, but yet they also admit they crash the server on purpose. Posts have been deleted, and nothing done. <br />
But now here is Paragon makes an apology and I willing to bet that their suspensions get quietly lifted so they can progress. While the rest suffer and have to pay what they did. <br />
We all pay to play, we all should get equal treatment. But that will never happen....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">qrko</div><div class="date">2011-12-06, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">LMAO. They gained some extra pixels faster than others, so what?Did someone was srsly offended by that? Where does this speach like a prime minister after a big government failure come from?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vallius</div><div class="date">2011-12-06, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its the other side, its a lose-lose situation for every top guild: <br />
<br />
A) Guilds that did it and got banned.<br />
B) Guilds that didnt do it may be good to get World Firsts, but they will be empty because the only reason they got those world firsts is because Paragon / Method / Envy are banned.<br />
<br />
So how is this a lose-lose, again? They -wanted- a strict repsonse from Blizzard. Go to Paragon's site and check their forums. A ban would hamper their progression for a while, sure, but it would also prevent the compition from doing the same. And even if some 3rd rate guild got the top slot your second point actually proves my point. It would feel hollow anyway because no one would grant them the win, in truth, because the big guys had to sit out for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a difference? Paragon exploited the bug, blizzard should not apologize to them at all, and you mean suspension not ban. (Exploit of a bug does not ends up a perma ban at all, but most likely a few days suspension)<br />
<br />
Paragon's is paying for their &quot;crimes&quot; by having a good few days of suspension, just like in justice. <br />
<br />
You kill a man, you go to &lt;Decided length of the sentence&gt; (lets say 25 years) of the murder, even if the murderer's apologizing. &lt;---just an example.<br />
<br />
Paragon's deserves every minute of their suspension, they WILLINGLY exploited the bug. Yet they are so pathetic for apologizing. If they are sorry, why did they exploited the big in the first place huh?<br />
<br />
What I am saying is, Paragon is not sorry for their actions at all, they are just putting the &quot;sorry&quot; face on.<br />
<br />
Edit: I hope Blizzard will NOT lift their suspension.</div></div><hr />
