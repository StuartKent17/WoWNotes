Mist of Pandaria Talent Calculator Updated<br />
The official Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator has been updated and a couple of classes got major updates to their skills. http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest, http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior apparently all got significant updates and other classes got minor updates. <br />
<br />
We trust you’ve all had ample time to plug away on the Mists of Pandaria Talent Calculator. You may have even found a few mind-bottling class changes in the works (you know, when things are so crazy it gets your thoughts all trapped, like in a bottle?).<br />
<br />
To that end, we’re pleased to announce we’ve just released an update to the calculator! In addition to bug fixes, we've made some changes as a result of your feedback.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is still a very early preview of the Mists of Pandaria talent system, which will likely continue to evolve during development of the expansion. We also don’t plan on making further updates to the calculator until we get much closer to our testing phase, but rest assured we’ll still be considering your feedback throughout the development process.<br />

<br />
The most notable change is the lvl 87 skill. It looks like a fade on stereoids to me, and I must admit my first thought was that this is somewhat reduntant for a class that already has Fade.... <br />
<br />
Another bombshell is that Holy seems to be the only spec to hold Prayer of Healing. Disc instead gets Holy Nova. Whoa. <br />
There is also a new passive handling healing pushback for Holy and Disc. <br />
Disc priests got Spirit Shell at the same level as Holy gets Heal, meaning this is the Disc &quot;cheap weak spell&quot;. Kinda expected that one. <br />
<br />
And Mind Spike and Mind Blast is added for shadowpriests. <br />
<br />
There may be more, but that's what I can spot outright ;)</div></div><hr />

Looks like Holy may &quot;officially&quot; be the only spec getting Renew, Heal, and Prayer of Healing. I'll be sad to see PoH go if this is true. :(<br />
Hymn of Hope appears to be Disc-only and Divine Hymn appears to be Holy-only too. Interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mysticism is the &quot;you wear only cloth&quot; bonus that all priests get at level 50. Unlike certain other classes, you don't really have a choice in getting this bonus. All specs get it. <br />
<br />
Disc will AoE heal thorugh Holy Nova. <br />
To get there, I expect Holy Nova to be radically reworked. <br />
- First of all, they need it to heal for more than 2 digits worth of damage per cast. <br />
- Second, The name is wrong. <br />
- Third, as this is the only AoE heal for a disc priest, it will either need a range increase, OR be targettable somehow. <br />
<br />
<br />
Of course, the latter option would put it right up the alley of the new paladin AoE heal, and reinstate all the Circle of Healing with no cooldown issues. So I'm not really sure what will happen, but it will probably work itself out somehow. I expect they will keep the spammable part though. It's not really Holy Nova unless it is spammable like crazy ;)<br />
<br />
No doubt, disc will be stronger at Single target healing than AoE healing. But you can't take the ability to AoE heal completely away from a disc priest. Unlike today, Holy Nova will have to be worth casting in MoP. We'll jsut have to wait and see how.</div></div><hr />

Well, I figured that meant 5 mastery as in 5 Mastery, not 5 mastery rating (much like the difference between 5% crit chance and 5 crit rating).<br />
<br />
Considering that my Shaman with a pretty hefty amount of mastery rating has around 16 mastery, 5 mastery is quite a lot. That's 25% extra damage to Ignite or another 12.5% bonus to Disc shields, for example.</div></div><hr />

Bane of Doom procs Wild Imps, the same imps that you can summon with the spell Wild Imps as Demonology. Soul Fire also has a baseline 4 second cast now and seems to have the Decimation effect of doubling cast time if cast before 25%, though that seems like a mistake to me, since that effect is also still tacked on to Decimation.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I saw that Disc is (seemingly) losing PoH and I kinda shuddered. Holy Nova will hopefully be reworked, and it would be good to see it become &quot;targettable&quot;. For instance, cast it on a friendly member and cause a Holy Nova to radiate from them, healing nearby allies for X. Perhaps it would also produce a small DA like PoH currently does? That seems to be one of the better options if they decide to rework HN. About changing the name, I saw a blue post offering to rename it Discipline Nova (Jokingly. I think the name is fine) ;) I like the direction they are going with priests in MoP :)</div></div><hr />

You raise a good point, and I noticed that too, about the drastic reduction in the amount Holy Shield mitigates. I also noticed many mage spells' mana costs being reduced to 1 or 2% mana. Perhaps they also got rid of the &quot;base mana cost&quot; and now it costs 1-3% of your total mana (this may actually be stated somewhere, idk). Could be very possible they are planning on squishing things in MoP.</div></div><hr />

Actually, you can't level up these talents by killing raid bosses, so in that respect, they are indeed not CoD perks. However, you are right in a sense and I, for one, think it's a great idea. Being able to actually CHOOSE how you want your character to play on a situational basis rather than a one-size-fits-all cookie-cutter spec (Don't get started about cookie cutters, I'm aware they will still exist to a small degree) is far more engaging, and in that sense is like CoD perks. But it seems you have ignored all these facts as the vast majority of people here already know what I'm saying. Have fun in SWTOR, I'm sure it will be fun, as is WoW currently, and will be in the next expac.</div></div><hr />

I happen to believe the game community will be better off with some of these people leaving. I just ask that people that disagree with the game do it in a mature way. You played WoW because it interested you. Now it doesn't. Instead of up and leaving, and starting a flamewar in the process, why not express what bothers you in a way that helps the developers to fix it? (I wasn't referring to you, I'm referring to the people that make posts like the guy above us).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, Paladins and Shamans only get their expensive heals (Flash of Light, Healing Surge, and Healing Rain), and in the case of Paladins, Word of Glory. So really, the healing potential of these class' dps specs are kind of low. Druids are not that much better, honestly, they just get a talent that allows them to heal more efficiently for a short time.</div></div><hr />

Shamans aren't going to get changed anymore. Blizzard know they effed up so bad with our class, that they just won't even bother anymore.<br />

<br />
The purpose must be that mages dont have any shield worth using i guess, mage armor is used by arcane all the time to help us with mana that is very much needed to be high most the time to be able to do damage so thats over i guess. arcane will be out of mana faster the you can blink with your eye's. and to make sure they dont get more damage they nerf molten armor too so its worthless.<br />
Hope blizzard change arcane to do normal damage all the time if the got full mana or low mana then or arcane spec is a dead spec.</div></div><hr />

But other then that, they can barely balance(Lol thats a funny word to use with a blizzard game) This game right now the way it is, I think they should just stick to the same formula and work on balancing from there, all these changes they are doing, it is going to over whelm them with work, and the game will be so out of whack the first 6 months on release. I think updates to our talents are nice and all to try out new things, but an over haul this big is just way too much for them to handle imo =/ .</div></div><hr />

The crit% bonus is a nice ability, but removing our AoE Taunt and then giving it back with a gimmick at 88 is really not compelling at all. Nor is removing Demo Shout only to give it back in this ability either. We want something new, not something rehashed with a slightly different mechanic.

I swear the new one recently was just: <br />
60 rage block next attack. <br />

It now has some of the old shield block mechanics but a little scaled back: <br />
60 Rage block next attack +25% Block for 6 seconds (on live we have for 10 seconds) <br />
<br />
Also if this pushes above 100% avoidance turns into critical block value. I'm surprised no one else noticed this as the pure 60 rage = 1 block was shocking to me. As all rage would be shunted into this for little gain.</div></div><hr />

Feel your pain man, not only we don't get a makeover, but they take our current makeup off... Nobody believes me but I ran the numbers, so far rogues sub are going to loose 11 abilities (passive/active), in the next expansion.

No they were removed because a few players would calculate the best spec to squeeze out .3 more dps and everyone would then google their spec and copy it exactly, occasionally you would have 2 or 3 talent points you could chose to use in whatever you wanted.<br />
<br />
More Talents != Complicated<br />
Fewer Talents != bad players</div></div><hr />

Spectral Guise - Your Shadow blurs into the darkness, leaving your true form behind. As a shadow you are invisible, but remain in combat. Lasts 6 seconds or until until your true form is hit by 3 direct attacks. 30 second cool downI have been suggesting this for warlocks for years. Why don't warlocks get a cool escape mechanic instead of a reverse suck blink that let's everyone know where you are going?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Leviatharan</div><div class="date">2011-12-08, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So thus far 6 classes have their level 87/88 abilities. Hunters had 'Stampede' implied to be their level 87 around the time the talent calculator went up, I believe. So that just leaves Death Knights, Shamans, and Rogues getting their level 87 spells (to which I must fervently ask 'Escape-worthy DPS-friendly Gap Closer for DKs, pleeeeease...') as well as the addition of the Monk tree. <br />
... <br />
Why do they insist that they're &quot;not planning on making future updates&quot; when it's so painfully obvious they will? :P /rhetoricalquestion<br />
(&quot;Much closer to the testing phase&quot; could mean anything really. It could mean until they're a week or 6 months away from the date they've planned, a week or 6 months from NOW, or after a certain mechanic/model/landmass/dungeon is completed, or whatever, so let's just eliminate the 'duuur they didn't say they wouldn't a-dur-durrr' comments at the pass.)</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind this is still a very early preview of the Mists of Pandaria talent system, which will likely continue to evolve during development of the expansion. We also don’t plan on making further updates to the calculator until we get much closer to our testing phase, but rest assured we’ll still be considering your feedback throughout the development process.</div></div><hr />

Wait, you thought it was gonna stay like that? You get it at level 45, obviously it's not gonna use the base value for max level...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Colossus Smash: Smashes a target for 150% weapon damage plus 306 and weakens their defenses, allowing your attacks to entirely bypass 100% of their armor for 6 sec, and increasing their physical damage taken by 4% for 30 sec.</div></div><hr />

The DK talent trees are the worse. How am I supposed to choose between Bone Shield or Lichborne and then choose between Death Pact or Vampiric Blood? As a tank, I need all of those talents.It's like they want to take away a fun element of the game, so that everyone can just pick up and play it. I am mostly a casual player, and I hate this change.</div></div><hr />
