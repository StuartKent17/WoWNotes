Well of Eternity<br />
Ten thousand years in the past, the night elven capital city of Zin-Azshari was a magnificent, sparkling metropolis. Situated on the shores of the Well of Eternity, Zin-Azshari was where the aristocratic Highborne first opened a portal into the Twisting Nether and invited the Burning Legion to invade Azeroth. Under the command of the night elven queen, Azshara, the Highborne now pour their energies into the portal, preparing it for the terrifying and glorious entrance of the titan Sargeras.<br />
<br />
With a gateway to the past now open, Nozdormu will transport players to Azshara's palace, where you'll witness one of the most catastrophic events in the War of the Ancients, dating back 10,000 years. While assisting the much younger Tyrande and Illidan in a battle against the Highborne and Burning Legion, players will need to steal the Dragon Soul hovering above the Well. With so many of Azshara's most empowered wizards locked in ritual and pouring their magical energies into the turbulent depths of the Well, retrieving the Dragon Soul will require victory over some lethal foes.<br />
<br />
Excerpts from the Dungeon Journal<br />
<br />
Peroth'arn: Like many of his fellow Highborne, Peroth'arn swore allegiance to the corrupted Xavius in exchange for gifts of demonic power. As a master of fiendish magic and recipient of the satyr curse, Peroth'arn stands outside Azshara's palace in defense of the Burning Legion, ready to destroy those hoping to disrupt the entrance of the Dark Titan, Sargeras, into Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Azshara: The songs of Queen Azshara's beauty, majesty, and power are too numerous to count, but it was her vanity that drove the Highborne to summon the Burning Legion. She now watches her most trusted magi empower the portal where Sargeras will be brought into Azeroth, content to let multitudes of her servants die in advance of the Dark Titan's arrival.<br />
<br />
Mannoroth and Varo'then: Varo'then, head of Queen Azshara's personal guard, and Mannoroth, the pit lord whose blood will corrupt the entire orc race, stand as the last line of defense against those hoping to bar Sargeras's entry into Azeroth. Though both Tyrande and Illidan have fought bravely thus far, the fate of Azeroth will be decided at the Well of Eternity's very brink.<br />
<br />
The task at hand requires nothing short of total success. In order for Thrall and the Dragon Aspects to rally heroes of the Horde and Alliance to defeat Deathwing, you must steal the Dragon Soul from the distant past. However, the tragic events which took place at the Well of Eternity must ultimately come to pass, leading to the Great Sundering, the creation of the Maelstrom, and the loss of countless lives.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for part three of our patch 4.3 dungeons preview: Hour of Twilight.<br />

It kind of clearly states Azshara is a boss, and we will be fighting Mannoroth and Varo'then together. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

My toon still feels like a nobody that is almost always given outside assistance when big fights occur--you would think, by now, that all of our characters would be recognized and revered wherever we go in-game.Of course, that doesn't really work in such a large setting. Millions of us can't be &quot;the next big deal&quot; character-wise, but it is getting harder for me to suspend my disbelief. That, and it seems like pivotal characters always forget who I am, despite me saving them or assisting them countless times through quest-chains. lol.Peanut gallery pokes aside, it looks to be pretty phenomenal. Always thought Azshara would be prettier than that, though, seeing as they always make such a big deal about her beauty (looks like a typical night elf with a fancy dress)</div></div><hr />

Then there's the part of me that says, &quot;Oh yeah, this should have been a damn raid and it would have been 10x more epic killing a raid boss Mannoroth, not a friggin heroic dungeon boss Mannoroth.&quot; The loregasm subsides a little.</div></div><hr />

Remember, neither actually die. Azshara becomes, well, Azshara. And Mannoroth must live to corrupt the orc race.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This opens up an AWESOME opportunity for a cinematic:<br />
<br />
Mannoroth getting sucked back into the portal, and Broxigar hopping into the portal to chop away at Sargeras. I hope they do something like that...</div></div><hr />

She already made an appearance, in Darkshore. Go to Nazj'vel and kill the Naga channeling a portal. It is part of an Alliance quest but you can still see the dialogue between her and Malfurion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because all we have heard from the raid was in interviews, we still know next to nothing about the third instance, besides it being in present day Dragonblight with Thrall. Wait until the official preview is released on it.</div></div><hr />

Are we going into the same time derivative that Rhonin, Krasus, and Broxigar were sucked into? or are we going to enter another temporal reality in which none of those events occurred, and in essence are stealing the Dragon/Demon Soul from another dimension/universe that coincides with our own timeline?<br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see. cause if we go back in time with Rhonin,Brox there. there will be a TON of explaining to be had, cause we will alter the past at the same time the past was altered previously.<br />
<br />
Where is a Timelord when you need one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those who wanted this as a raid...We already got Hyjal ;)<br />
Nah, I mean seriously, this is pretty epic. You get to participate in a huge event, but ultimately don't get remembered for it because it never happened...then in the present you don't get recognition for Deathwing's fall later anyway, as the Aspects will. Players don't get recognition, and are the unsung heroes of time and Azeroth. We're the best.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, i wish Night Elves weren't all treehuggers and nature freaks in the Current timeline and had some of these structures, they rarely ever have stone buildings outside of Darnassus. And tree buildings kinda get boring after a while.</div></div><hr />

This really depends on how the timeline is interpreted at this point. If we enter another alternate timeline like we did when we went to the future. This also means that we did not affect our own timeline (which saves us the question of where the hell Rhonin and the gang are in the dungeon).<br />

Brox leapt from the back of one of the red dragons also carrying Rhonin into the swirling portal that was opening at the bottom of the funnel. When he passed through, and arrived in the realm of the Burning Legion, he proceeded to slaughter multitudes of demons, blocking their advance towards the portal, slaying so many that he ended up standing atop a hill of their bodies — mocking more to come challenge him. It was there that he eventually attracted the attention of Sargeras, who came personally to put an end to the orc's life. However, using the magical axe crafted for him by Malfurion, Brox did the impossible, and struck a small wound in Sargeras' leg. This wound would later be the focus of Krasus and his allies' spellwork, that for a second, tore Sargeras' attention away from his struggle to keep the portal open...allowing Malfurion and Illidan to close it upon him. Brox's life was ended by Sargeras, right before the demon entered the portal, by the jagged edge of Sargeras's broken sword. With this final act of loyalty, Broxigar the Red sealed his place in history as the only known mortal to have ever staged an assault upon the Burning Legion's leader. <br />
<br />
He's the best. Without him, we'd all be dead.</div></div><hr />

As big as WoW is, it is not a 1:1 ratio with the actual size of the game. None of the cities are miles long. So many of the towns are just 4-5 buildings. In the lore these places are bigger and with more structures. It's a game design limitation, either by technology or by common sense design decisions (seriously, we're not using much of the world as it is, even before we all hunkered down in SW and Org).</div></div><hr />

As weve said before, this instance will more than likely be an alternate timeline to our own. and In essence, will be another dimension and universe that does not affect our own if we alter it.<br />

<br />
Nope, he isn't a good guy.<br />
<br />
From my understanding, the Well of Eternity that we're visiting is only accessed after going through the End Times dungeon, which is an &quot;alternative&quot; possible future. It's like a back to front Back to the Future plot. We are jumping on to another time line. That time line wont come to pass for our world, so who cares about disrupting that continuum? Ol' Nozzi is only charged with looking after the intended timeline afterall.</div></div><hr />

There are more than 2 timelines, there are multiple ones, and no one knows (not even Nozdormu) if the one where the Timeless One become leader of the infinite is the original.<br />

Yeah I just looked it up, I was thinking of someone else.<br />

No one is quite exactly sure how this 5 man trio will run its course. None of us know if Nozdormu is actually corrupted in our timeline, or if its a Nozdormu from an alternate timeline that is trying to alter our own for his own reasons.<br />

Whatever is demonic on him now is probably because of sargeras<br />

The alternate timeline will probably not be given the chance of knowing that the Demon Soul is &quot;missing.&quot; Remember, Nozdormu can go to any point in time that he choices. He could go back to exactly one sec or whatever right after the Demon Soul is taken and place it right where it was. No one would be the wiser.<br />

And Azshara is a Highborne, which is essentially the upperclass of the night elf society.</div></div><hr />

Illidan hadn't found the skull of Gul'dan just yet so he couldn't be a demon. He should, however, have the arcane markings and the loss of site at this point (the bandana across his eyes). Right? Azshara was a high elf, not a night elf ... at least I thought she would look differently. She should also be much much more appealing. They're not perceiving her beauty the way it was described.<br />
<br />
The high elves come later in the timeline, but yes you are right on two other accounts (1) the Well was much bigger in the book, and (2) Azshara should be the most beautiful sight ever to behold; alas, the is Blizzard and models have been recycled. Cracking event in time for us to sink our teeth into nonetheless but it's a shame the timeline which we will interact with will not involve Brox.</div></div><hr />

Probably neither. Seeing as if we're sent back to the same time as Rhonin, then there's a good chance we'll like create a paradox of sorts, and make even MORE alternate time lines. @_@</div></div><hr />

Or something about alternate timelines and all that confusing stuff. Because it's cool to mess with others' timelines, so long as ours remains intact.</div></div><hr />

That would be an alternate time line, which is what will be produced from taking the Demon Soul. This is, of course, if it isn't returned. Which Nozdormu can do. Like I said before, Nozdormu is capable of moving along a timeline as he pleases. So it is possible he'll simply return a few moments after he (in the past) took it to replace it. Time travel shenanigans hurts teh brain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a bad idea. Then you'd just be spawning lots of alternate time lines. They would eventually collide with each other and ultimately destroy time. That's why you should always be careful whenever you use time travel.</div></div><hr />

These &quot;timeline&quot; instances are far more interesting than anything that has been in the Caverns of Time. Great concepts all around.</div></div><hr />

The timeline we play in WoW is the altered timeline in which Rhonin-sue and gang went all Marty McFly. Hence how in the Shattering novel Brox's niece is a main character looking to kill Malfurion (who she mistakenly believes was responsible for Brox's death) and has Brox's magic wooden axe. So I don't see why we wouldnt be going back to that timeline if we traveled back in time from this timeline that is a result of it (using Back to the Future time travel/alternate time line mechanics)</div></div><hr />

So did i buddy. I imagined that the Well was gigantic and the city was only built on the shore of it.<br />
<br />
But then again, i should have guessed that since the Highbourne was able to isolate the others from it, the city must have been able to surround it. So either Zin-Azhari would have to be enomous, or the well was smaller then we though :D</div></div><hr />

It was much bigger, so big that two other cities were on its shores. And the Highborne didnt isolate others from it phyiscally by posting guards or something, they isolated it magically.</div></div><hr />
