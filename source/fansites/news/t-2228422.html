Brawl - Tarren Mill vs. Southshore<br />
June 13–20 - Originally introduced as a part of the World of Warcraft 10-Year Anniversary event, this Brawl harkens back to the early days of WoW PvP, with an epic battle between the two towns of Tarren Mill and Southshore. In this game of war, you’ll need to work as a team and deplete your foes’ resources to claim victory.<br />
<br />
We've identified an issue with the brawl's matchmaking that is resulting in most of the comments I see here. We currently have a hotfix in testing to resolve this issue, so hang tight!<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reports here!<br />

i normaly do it just for the extra order resources. would be nice though if they scaled the rewards up a bit. though not to broken shores world boss levels.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Casual&quot; is becoming a really silly word in this game. What you call casual I call pretty hardcore. <br />
<br />
I consider myself casual, and I'm sitting on less than 5k of them. The only thing I have to spend resources on are missions. I'm constantly struggling to keep up on resources to keep the missions churning 24/7.</div></div><hr />

when im hurting for resources il just check for resource world quests. sucks though when you need so much for your order hall research and you are playing multiple characters.</div></div><hr />

That, or the new way to upgrade legendaries. That might suck though for alts and new(ish) players. Or make them an alternative so people can either do a questline or use the Resources.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably you already know that, but you can exchange blood of sargeras for 200 resource each and also is account wide, meaning that you can channel all your blood of sargeras / resources into 1 character.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ukerric</div><div class="date">2017-05-31, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see what the Broken Shore campaign has to offer:<br />
<br />
Week 1: Do the Broken shore scenario; unlock all fly points<br />
Week 2: Do a Legion Assault<br />
Week 3: Recruit a 6th champion<br />
Week 4: Turn in the shards you already had in your inventory<br />
Week 5: Do some Sentinax farming<br />
Week 6: Do the world quests you already did to get flying 3 weeks ago<br />
Week 7: Wait your turn on the Felsoul Hold cannons so you can shoot 100 bats from the sky since everyone told you it was the fastest way<br />
Week 8: Compete against every player to find 10 chests before they depop by logging in early morning when few people are playing<br />
Week 9: Wait until you have 3 elites spawned on the shore to kill<br />
Week 10: Click in your class hall until you complete the mission (or use Classhall Commander to autobuild your team)<br />
<br />
I've highlighted the &quot;interesting&quot; things in the campaign. Interesting in that they involve doing things you potentially didn't do on your own at some time. The 3 elites is slightly more interesting than the rest, but you've probably killed at least once by happenstance.<br />
<br />
So the big problem is that most of the interesting stuff was frontloaded. You did the interesting bits early in the campaign, and the easy/not very engaging come later.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ComputerNerd</div><div class="date">2017-05-31, 09:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">15k resources.<br />
Useless for my main at nearly 300k.<br />
Great for alts still progressing order halls.<br />
<br />
A dump for them is something Garrisons did better IMO.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because that 860 Arcanocrystal is not almost on par with a mythic Guldan trinket... Absolutely not worth doing....</div></div><hr />

I'm playing a few hours a night at best, that's pretty casual.<br />
<br />
If you do Emissary daily and you turn in Bloods for Order Resources you'd have much more than 5k.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may not appreciate the extra resources, but my 10 stone-broke alts are nore than appreciative.<br />
<br />
Only my main is rolling in resources.<br />
<br />
I'm certainly not doing Legionfall campaign on more than 1 guy, that's ridiculous. Best I'll do is take the few that did the BS scenario out for the world bosses when they're up. I'm basically only playing 2 characters seriously now and since I got Concordance on my main he's taking a break, haven't even done Emissary quests on him since Saturday.<br />
