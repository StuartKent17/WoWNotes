<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
A new Battle for Azeroth feature, Island Expeditions, is now available for testing for characters at level 110 or higher. Your level and item level will be automatically adjusted to level 120 values.<br />
<br />
WARNING: There is a known issue with queue as a party that is resulting in a disconnect. Please queue solo until we can give you the all-clear.<br />
<br />
Alliance players can queue from the Expedition table in Boralus Harbor, near the Tradewinds Market. Look for the green ship occupying the second slip. <br />
<br />
Horde players can queue from the Expedition table in Zuldazar Harbor, at the Port of Zandalar, on the west side. Look for the red ship.<br />
<br />
What are we testing?<br />
We are currently testing Un’gol Ruins on Normal difficulty.<br />
There are 12 NPC teams available for testing (6 per faction).<br />
<br />
What is the goal of an Island Expedition?<br />
The goal of an Island Expedition is to collect Azerite. The first team to 6000 Azerite wins.<br />
A group of NPCs from the opposing faction will also be present, competing with you for the Azerite.<br />
Many things on the Island reward Azerite: chests, Azerite crystals, powerful creatures, friendly NPCs in need of aid, killing enemy NPCs, and more.<br />
You’ll find things you can interact with, scattered all across the Island to help you.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: this feature is currently in an alpha state. There are several placeholder elements and missing pieces. Many updates are on their way.<br />
<br />
Thank you for testing, and we’re looking forward to your feedback.<br />
<br />
And watch out for Sneaky Pete :]</div></div><hr />

If you want an upright Troll, that's what the Zandalari bring. Worgen being upright wouldn't work, since their heads would be facing upwards.</div></div><hr />

Well considering that the Barber also makes face lifts, skin changes, tattoos, eye colors, different horn implants and so on, i would consider that the concept of &quot;Barber Shop&quot; should be upgraded to &quot;beauty clinic&quot; or something like that, lol<br />

Well, you know Blizzard needs more $$$$$ from the change character services on the old classic races ;) and also more incentives to race change to the new races :D (and with that also gets $$$$$)<br />

Welp, guess this finally confirms for 100% (as opposed to 99%) that Kul Tirans are the new Alliance allied race. <br />
<br />
I didn't really expect them to get druids. Very interesting!<br />
<br />
Well with alpha Kul Tiras Druid NPCs, that was almost given as certain, I guess.<br />
And also confirms that Dark Irons can be shamans (finally), because it is actually the first time MMO Champ posted a preview on their totems<br />
Also by the icons, it seems both dwarf and dark iron dwarf paladins are going to receive a new charger mount as well</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems like it, but remember only one and a half of their specs can actually see their transmog while doing content. That is resto and balance, and balance only with a glyph that makes everything blue. Feral and Guardian get about 10 options at most with different tints. Compare that to all the transmog for all the other classes.</div></div><hr />

It makes much more sense than adding Dark Irons as the allied race once we finish the Kul Tiran content.</div></div><hr />

I know it's very early, but i rly loosed fate abou demonology being a DECENT spec, not good but decent, this is all i want. It's clear that somebody should be fired from the class design team.<br />

Don't know if it was mentioned before but did you know that barbers used to be surgeons too in medieval times? So it makes perfect sense. ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Orcs can head to the barbershop to adjust their posture!&quot; so allied races can change their skin color at the barber, orcs get to change their posture (undead possibly the next) but we can't change our skin colors on our regular races at the barber? :/<br />
<br />
Was thinking the same. Why didn't they unlock skin colour for all races when they unlocked it for the &quot;Allied&quot; ones?<br />

imo literally everybody whos connected to wod and legion prunings should be fired without pension<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't like how blizzard is changing [insert class and spec here] so they should fire someone and destroy their livelihood cause I don't like it!&quot; <br />
<br />
You should grow up, not liking something in a video game is no reason to fire someone and ruin their lives. That's kind of fucking sick when you think about it.</div></div><hr />

people not doing their fucking jobs properly is not the reason to fire them? lol wtf?<br />
<br />
should they not be accountable for things like surv hunter and demo locks (and many other trash specs aka arcane 4 blinks ferrari god) and other admitted fails? these so called class designers have ruined game experience for many millions of people who love WoW, should they not be punished for that in any way?<br />
<br />
laughable</div></div><hr />

You do realize that more than one person is responsible for each class and their changes right? And they have to get approval from whoever's in charge, etc. So, basically if they did what you suggest and just fired people whenever something didn't work out, they'd be running out of employees pretty fast. <br />
<br />
But yeah, just keep pretending you know how it all works. :)</div></div><hr />

good, people who did and approved all the prunings and legion and wod must go so maybe we'll have a slight chance of seeing wow with not castrated butchered classes.</div></div><hr />

Yea wouldn't want anyone to catch on to the fact...<br />
<br />
Same run of the mill but you get to explore a few new features with redesigned classes again(xx again)! Wouldn't be fun if you didn't need to adapt in some way. More fun for them to redesign the classes every expansion than come up with some good plots and stories unfortunately. Or actually just attempt to make the classes interesting and distinguished from each other with their gameplay and mechanics :rolleyes: With all the pop references littering their game on top, I'm starting to think that it's more fun to come up with all that crap, than it is to experience it as part of the audience. Like with the majority of TV and screenplays...</div></div><hr />

Doing mistakes in that regard in only a matter of what YOU perceive. Doing good or bad class design is subjective as hell.<br />
Clear failure with Service Level Agreements objectifves explicated with rational &quot;can&quot; be a reason for firing ... in old firms management.<br />
Management 3.0 accept mistakes dude, waky waky.<br />
<br />
Now objectively, I do like the warlock changes. They changed Raging Imp with something that synergizes more with other spell / talent =&gt; more &quot;demon&quot; gameplay.<br />
Also they is sill instant Demonbolt thingy (in a less predictable form with RNG, sure, they love it):<br />
<br />
Demonic Core Name changed from &quot;Molten Core&quot; to &quot;Demonic Core&quot;. When your Wild Imps expend all of their energy, they have a 15% chance to combust into a ball of energy you have a 10% chance to absorb their life essence, granting you a stack of Molten Core. Molten Demonic Core. When your summoned Dreadstalkers fade away, you have a 100% chance to absorb their life essence, granting you a stack of Demonic Core. Demonic Core reduces the cast time of Demonbolt by 100%. Maximum 4 stacks. Warlock - Demonology Spec. 100 yd range.<br />
<br />
They're just theming to 100% the whole spec Demonology into ... Demons wording.</div></div><hr />

development means getting X better, not worse.<br />
<br />
I dont care what you say about subjective bullshit, classes since wod are way simplier, easy and they have less depth and mechanics to play around.<br />

Not sure if I trust a barber to work with my spine :)<br />

Little known fact, orc spines are actually made of hair.<br />

Only 1 thig blizzard did perfectly fine about Demonology Warlock, and that was raging imps... Instant soulfires could make demonology be decent in pvp and pretty good in pve. I know it's very early, but i rly loosed fate abou demonology being a DECENT spec, not good but decent, this is all i want. It's clear that somebody should be fired from the class design team.<br />
<br />
Demonic core makes DB instant baseline. We also get soul strike if that's not enough mobility for you.</div></div><hr />

i'm not talking about turning a regular dwarf into a dark iron dwarf, i'm talking about switching between the regular skin colors that you can choose between at character creation</div></div><hr />
