Quests<br />

The item Gods and Monsters has been restored to its proper function, and will now be sent to players who complete the Gods and Monsters Achievement, allowing them to start the quest “Gods and Monsters”.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Invasion Experience Changes<br />
We see that this has been noticed already, but for more clarity - the frequency of invasions has been tripled, and you will have more invasions to participate in throughout the day. To compensate for this, we have reduced XP awarded for each individual invasion.<br />
<br />
Remember that as we move closer to the launch of Legion, you can expect an increased Legion presence in both numbers and cadence as their invasion grows stronger.<br />
<br />
See you on the battlefield!<br />

you get 6 invasions every 4 hours now instead of just 2. The exp might have been nerfed but because you can do more total, its an increase to the exp gained every 4 hours.</div></div><hr />

This feels like going from making a decent wage to having your pay cut to minimum wage. Then being told that your hours have tripled so really you are making more than you ever were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That xp nerf is very harsh, for example for first stage, at level 92, I got 14 k exp, for second 28 and third 21k, for last 40k, while I used to get 55k for stages 1-3 and almost 90k for final boss. Nerf is ridiculous and doing invasions for leveling, at least at higher level, is pointless.</div></div><hr />

completely agree, just did one invasion on my 64 wlock... where i used to get 1/2 lvls for one invasion i now got 35% xp... it doesnt take a shorter time to do an invasion so i cant be f*cked to do all of them for this amount of xp. hope blizz turns it back</div></div><hr />

YES. This cuts to the heart of it. I was loving the invasions because I was hoping to get 2-3 classes up to 100 so I could enjoy a variety of the new class-based content. At the previous amounts, I could do it once or twice a day with two toons, get them 3 levels each, and carry on. They might be offering more, but I can't sit at my compy more. So, my pay was reduced to minimum wage, but I still can only do the same hours in a day. Major net loss, and very frustrating.</div></div><hr />

Also in many cases for lowbie toons the invasions are in zones that are too high to get to unless a friend flies you there (which doesn't happen often). For example for lowbie Alliance Westfall or Dun Murogh is easy, but gl getting to Tanaris and a 20's toon on Horde or Alliance without a lot of work. So because of those things, more invasions does not offset cutting xp from them to less than half what they were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To an extent, it does. Of the six invasion zones, only one of them (Tanaris) that requires a toon better than level 25, which isn't exactly a hard level to get to by any other means. With more zones up, it's easy enough to find one that you can actually use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No you don't. Unless of course you did 2 invasions and then AFKed for 3 hours. Right now literally ANYTHING is more experience per hour than invasions. Before? I could do two invasions and still have three hours to do dungeons or quests for even more experience, now? That is gone, so its just the shitty invasion XP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Max level toons are the ones best served by this change. Grinding 700 gear was tough with only two invasion zones per four hours, especially if you're only missing a piece or two (My Druid's had most of the gear for ages and has been getting nothing but duplicates).<br />
<br />
While it sucks that it's at the expense of XP for my lower level characters (I've got a Warlock, Warrior, and Rogue to go before I've got one of each class at 90 or better), but the change makes sense in context of benefiting max level toons as keeping the massive XP gain while being able to run more invasions would break leveling in a way that would presumably not be intentional.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would imagine they are catering to characters of max level. The experience gains are just an extra little bonus they threw in just for the heck of it. They didn't create invasions solely so everyone can level new characters and all of their alts and ignore their max level characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Short answer: yes, you can access the Broken Shore stuff after Legion drops according to Twitter remarks.<br />
<br />
In any case, leveling a Hunter to 100 should be doable before then. Hunters are one of the easier classes to level. The biggest slog is the 60-80 region. Once you're past 80, the Cata and Pandaria stuff flies by and the WoD content can be plowed through in an evening if you focus primarily on bonus quests instead of legit questing.<br />

With CRZ, it's extremely rare to find an invasion with nobody in it. I logged on at like 3 AM after a bout of restless sleep a few nights ago and there was still plenty of people on to do an invasion no sweat.</div></div><hr />

You only get more xp in the same 4 hour time span IF you do all 6 of the invasions vs getting that same xp doing 2 invasions before.

It's absolutely a nerf, but I think people are getting a bit carried away with the melodrama on it. Leveling a toon is not a daunting task, nor has it been since they started allowing cross realm mail for things like heirlooms. I just came back to the game after a hiatus maybe two months ago and I've managed to level a Monk from 40 to 100, a DK from about 65 to 99 (Without running a single dungeon on him), a Rogue from 60 to 87, and grinded out Draenor flight on my main (I was at low honored on the reps when I took a break from the game). This while sharing my account with my wife and kid and getting out and about (All told, I get maybe an hour or two of gametime two to three nights a week). The DK is the only one of those I've done Invasion leveling with.<br />
<br />
It's just not that hard and an XP nerf to a temporary pre-launch event is a funny thing to complain about.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">permifrost</div><div class="date">2016-08-16, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No you don't. Unless of course you did 2 invasions and then AFKed for 3 hours. Right now literally ANYTHING is more experience per hour than invasions. Before? I could do two invasions and still have three hours to do dungeons or quests for even more experience, now? That is gone, so its just the shitty invasion XP.<br />
<br />
I think this kind of sums it up perfectly for me. Sure you can get a bit more XP. But that means you have to do every single invasion every 2 hours. So essentially what took you an hour before, will now take you 4. I just don't have that kind of time anymore. And my alt is lower level so I just began grinding invasions, and there is no way I can make it to all 3 with my limited travel.<br />
<br />
Granted I was planning on doing the dungeon grind with this alt anyway, but it was just nice to have something different to do every few hours instead of queuing. Not a total turnoff, I'll still go when it's a reasonable travel distance and save some chests, just an annoyance that it got made harder/more time consuming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it took for level 50 min ( 2 zones + travel time).<br />
Now it takes 2,5 hours...Yes they are more frequent. But they will not go any faster. On top of that. Because of the xp nerf . they are not useful anymore to level so even less people will play them ( because if you get the gear and toys that would be the only reason to do it).<br />

The exp might have been nerfed but because you can do more total, its an increase to the exp gained every 4 hours.<br />
<br />
Yes but time to complete the cycle was increased as well. So you are not getting the same amount of EXP for time invested thus it is much lower. Besides the EXP gain was halved even though there is only 1 extra invasion spot per cycle now. It's not worthwhile anymore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThatsOurEric</div><div class="date">2016-08-16, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are invasions still worth it for leveling then?<br />
<br />
Not at all.<br />
<br />
Previously, I was getting 71k per stage, with the final stage giving me over 100k<br />
experience. It also helped that I had full heirlooms. The exp I would get would<br />
nearly equal one full level up. Like literally, leaving what, 15% or less left, which<br />
would mean my character would definitely level up in the next one)<br />
<br />
With the new hotfix, this is what my lvl 75 Shaman was getting per Stage :<br />
Stage 1 : 18k (Was 71k)<br />
Stage 2 : 36k (Was 71k)<br />
Stage 3 : 27k (Was 71k) Why the fuck am I getting less on Stage 3 than on Stage 2? Fucking retarded.<br />
Stage 4 : 54k (Was 100k)<br />
<br />
So I would have to do at least 2 or 3 of these invasions to equal the amount I would<br />
have gotten from the one.<br />
<br />
They honestly, should have left well enough alone in terms of the exp amount, and<br />
just simply increased the amount of invasions. Everyone would have been happy,<br />
but I guess they can't (or don't in this case) want to do so.<br />
<br />
I swear, I just don't understand the stupidity of their decisions sometimes.</div></div><hr />

This. I'll never get over the insane amount of whining generated over minor changes like this. So maybe Blizz didn't intend their pre-launch event to be a way for people to skip the leveling process? People are acting like Blizzard triple-charged them and then deleted their accounts or something.<br />

Honestly, some people have maxed characters on several servers - I personally only have about 6 100s total across 2 servers, and the rest are alts. I am fairly sure they are catering to there elite fans that play 24/7. Hence why they reduced XP for lower levels - I don't believe the story of it was because they added more invasions, or they would of never added it in the first place. It's possible it was one of those situations &quot;oh crap forgot to take that out of the code from beta&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You're projecting. It's an annoying change and it's one of those changes that makes you wonder if Blizzard thinks shit through. I mean, why do this? Sure, boosts, but how many people doing invasion leveling were really going to spend $60 if the invasions hadn't given XP? Few, I'll bet.<br />
<br />
it's also an indication that the devs don't really get player psychology. it's almost always a poor move to give something then take it away. You're far better off starting small and then increasing the reward if the first iteration is too little. This just feels petty and mean-spirited on their part.</div></div><hr />

No people like me gave them lots of feedback in beta so Legion would be the best it could be, and that is why you will never get into one. These little changes are effecting something that wont exist in 2 more weeks so it isn't really that big of a deal in the long run.</div></div><hr />

So tell me, if they give less XP individually then dungeons, what is the point? Why even let people under 100 do them? There is no point so long as dungeons trump them on a per hour basis.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying dungeons require a ton of thought or anything, but to say that in comparison to Demon Invasions is ludicrous. Like I said, you can literally just sit there on your mount and not do anything and still get experience.<br />
<br />
As to what is the point: it's a pre-patch event. The point is to do something new and have a little fun. It's going away in two weeks and it's very clearly not intended to be a sustainable manner of leveling characters. It's neat that we got a week of really high bonus XP for it, but now it's gone and you can go back to running dungeons for XP instead of sweating the min-max. As it stands, you can level in no time with a group running through and doing dungeon quests.<br />

I just noticed that this xp is the same as opening 2 treasure chests in Talador with heirlooms, per stage. But the invasion stages take a lot more time to complete! almost 15 minutes for stage 3 and 5-8 minutes for stage 4.<br />
<br />
At that rate, you were better off in Draenor anyway. I leveled an heirloomed Monk at DK pretty much straight through Draenor doing nothing but bonus quests in less than four hours each.</div></div><hr />

LOL, is this a joke? I was hoping they would NERF soul cleave healing. As a resto sham, I'm already getting outhealed by DH tanks in 5 man heroics. Kind of makes me wonder what the point of bringing a healer is. Just fill the group with soul cleaving DH's that can heal half their hit points in one button press. No need for dedicated healers.<br />
<br />
I understand there's a tank shortage. But there has to be a better way than giving tanks godly self-healing and dps. Tanks shouldn't be topping the damage and healing charts.</div></div><hr />

These little changes are effecting something that wont exist in 2 more weeks so it isn't really that big of a deal in the long run.<br />
<br />
If it's not a big deal why not leave it as is? They first hotfixed it because the xp was too low, and now they nerfed it because the xp would've been too much. They really should've thought about this when they first hotfixed it. As it is now if you're sub lvl 60 it's not very enjoyable, due to you not having flying mounts, if you're above 60 it's doable if you only play 1 alt, if you play multiple alts it's not worth it unless you're doing RAF and can summon.</div></div><hr />

Who ever said it was game breaking? If it had been game breaking they would have fixed it immediately instead of waiting until the next scheduled hotfix - but it was overpowered, and so they put in a fix during the next scheduled hotfix.<br />

Wrong, rounding number here but if you previously were getting 150k xp with 2 invasions up 300k total now im seeing 3 up and people are saying you get roughly 100k now per invasion so you get the same for doing one more invasion. Not sure how you think that is more than before</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the players, lowbys doing as much dps as level 100s.<br />
<br />
Plus, you can't have a mob scale down if there's a level 100 engaged. Easier to have the player scale up, like they do in battlegrounds but yea, using this to level my RAF before it ends. 2.5 levels per invasion right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to do a lot more work for the exp too. When there were 2 invasions every 4 hours I was awarded about 70% of a lvl worth of exp. So I got 140% in total for doing two invasions with plenty of time to quest and run dungeons inbetween. Now I get about 30% per invasion which means I have to do 3 more invasions than before to get to about the same I got before. The net result maybe higher for the 4 hours when only doing invasions but in total I was leveling way faster with the old system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not wrong, some guy posted his numbers before from before and after, and he would be getting 90k more exp now, and that's not even including kills which give more exp now. And of course it won't be worth the time now if you're looking to solely level ASAP, but if you want to be lazy and level, you'll be gaining more than before.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holofernes</div><div class="date">2016-08-17, 03:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">in eu i was solo grinding mobs from stage 3 hillsbrad the last two hours. after like 30 minutes, i got kicked out of the realm and had to login again, aftewards xp from the smae mobs was increased by roughly 30%, and i was up to stage 1 again. so i am 100 % sure there was a xp buff hotfix this night.<br />
<br />
Now stage completion: 1 gave same xp than before (15 k at lvl 92 / 93 ), stage 2 gave double the xp of stage 1 (40 k), and stage 3 went from solo grinding mobs to 60 something percent until servers shutdown. in Hillsbrad the mobs that used to give 750 xp now yield 1.1150. (roughly, there could be a later 1 or a 5 or a zero exchanged, its freaking late), but like 30 % more as i said. <br />
<br />
AND: there are mobs that have same hp and are easier to kill / dont come in groups on the outskirts. they yield triple to quadropule the xp, standard was 4.5k xp (compared to 3750 xp before the latest mentioned till now undocumented hotfix). Especialle the fire elemental mobs yield a shotton of xp (8k normals, the elites (which only takes a little longer to kill) are up to 15 kxp (somehow its not very consistent, for the same mob u would one time get 12 k, another time 15 k, another time 8k with no npc or other player nearby). The nonelites though are very consistently 4.5 k xp. <br />
<br />
so in 1/half ours of grinding the invasion, i mad lvl 92 4% to lvl 93 60 % with a hillsbrad invasion to stage 3 and than solo grind it (nobody else was there) to like 60 %, than kick from server and hotfix with mob xp buff appliedI<br />
<br />
I think the goal of the hotfixes is to make participating actively in mob killing more efficent, and leveling on empty realms with stage 3 taking forever is a VERY fast way to lvl your char. u get like 10-30 k xp per minute, with heirlooms only.<br />
<br />
If you group with other players, your xp is gutted. you dont get group xp bonus, u get a malus and this malus is something like 70 % for a 6 lvl higher person killing the mb with you (or just idling in his sandstone drake above you and doing nothing, u still get xp malus). I dont get the reason for this and i am pretty sure the xp spread / malus is not intended. My now lvl 93 mage (was 71 when i started doing invasion with him this afternoon) has btw higher killspeed on mobs than my ilvl 740 fury warrior, that nearly killed archimonde mythic today (yeah 3 % infernals), and can kill most of the mobs without taking dmg. As a 740 fury warrior i have to sit down and eat after a triple pull.</div></div><hr />

My XP gain went from approximately 70% of a level per invasion to about 30% of a level. That's a nerf, son. So now I have to put in over 250% more effort for the same rewards.

I wish I could give you a million thumbs up. Your post is spot on. My low level DK gets 1-2 shot also. Also only way to get full XP is to solo mobs. You actually get pissed when someone helps you. Not the way its supposed to be.</div></div><hr />

I really didnt expect that much xp for low lvl chars in the first place to be honest, so after i was done with the xmog collecting it struck me with surprise how effective invasions are for leveling lower characters.<br />
<br />
And how effective are small chars in killing demons! :D<br />
<br />
I only needed gear for 1 lvl100 char so that was quick even with 2 invasions. All of my other max lvl toons were 700 or better ilvl-wise, and i cant be bothered to farm invasions for a rare warforged item. <br />
<br />
Leveling alt chars is not an option through invasions after the xp nerf imho, so it seems this event is over for me mostly.</div></div><hr />

(Forced to... sigh) playing Alliance on Outland where there's like 80-20 alliance pvp kiddies, but I think our shards seem pretty equal<br />
It's more of an issue since the invasions take place right outside main cities, so that creates extra skewing. Outside of IF and in Westfall of course is Alliance favored, but in Azshara/Barrens it's equal or slightly horde favored</div></div><hr />

At first I got so excited because open PvP and such. I don't know why the system even works like that. You can't fill an empty server with Horde from other Servers (Eredar, Frostwolf, ...) and think it's a well designed system.<br />
<br />
I got pissed before, because while leveling you always have 5-6 trigger happy horde players around you and no Alliance to help. It really seems noone is playing Alliance anymore.</div></div><hr />

The xp boost consists in the xp you get from mobs, the gigantic stupidity of their buff is: if ANY higher level player hits your mob, it divides the xp you get by 100000000000 and you won't get anything. On my server invasion went from: overcrowded, to: why am I alone here?</div></div><hr />

Seems really awkward for Blizzard to not include voice-acting during these quests with so much emphasis on dialogues during the quests. I haven't been this frustrated by trying to read the dialogue in the chat window while doing a questline for a long time... Considering the focus on the new voice dialogue window in Legion and in the previous Broken Shore intro etc it feels really bad not to have any of it during these quests.<br />
<br />
This results in the quests feeling really lacklustre compared to what we got previously in the Pre-Patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
And why does Blizzard insist on simply teleporting us everywhere? I had great hopes for this questline as I knew we were going to visit iconic places like Ulduar and Karazhan again. But my enthusiasm got smoldered by the fact that the game insist on giving me portal from Orgrimmar directly to Dalaran, and from Dalaran to within Uldum, then a portal directly to Karazhan and even within Karazhan we get teleported directly to the library where we get a final portal taking us back to Dalaran.<br />
<br />
Come on now, this is truly killing me Blizzard. I'm not against the whole Dungeon Finder and Looking for RAID tool. I don't feel the need for gather a group of players and fly to the various dungeon entrances, especially when knowing I will need to farm these dungeons a lost of times to get all my gear before entering RAIDing.<br />
<br />
<br />
But why kill the whole world aspect of the game by forcing players through lazy portals instead of having us fly around to these icon locations during the quest-chain? The expansion is not arriving until 30th of August so we still got a lot of time to kill in the game. So it's not like we are in a hurry, so we don't need the portals in order for the quests to take 20 minutes instead of 40 minutes. And it's not like these quests are something players can farm, so we will be doing them over-and-over again endlessly. So why all the portals?<br />
<br />
It really reduces my excitement for the quests a whole lot. And that saddens me a great deal. I would have enjoyed them much more if I was able to actually travel to these locations instead of just jumping through a portal all the time.</div></div><hr />

Easier to have the player scale up, like they do in battlegrounds but yea, using this to level my RAF before it ends. 2.5 levels per invasion right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope, that's wrong. Mobs scale to the player, even if players of different levels are attacking it. It's the cool tech they've added for legion. So, say it takes 10 white damage hits to kill a mob at 100, that same mob will take ten hits for a player at level 10, and if a 100 and a 10 attack at the same time, 5 hits from each will kill it (excluding crits etc) I saw this working in beta, with myself at 100 and a friend at 109 levelling in the same zone. Very cool tech.<br />
<br />
Try it yourself, take a low level to an invasion, you will see the same mob have much lower health to you and you will see your spells doing normal damage.</div></div><hr />

If we are going to use this logic the game falls apart. Why don't we have portals everywhere? Both the Horde, and especially the alliance got some really good Mages in their arsenal. Why don't we have portals to everywhere? Why do we even have to move at all?<br />

Right now, every single player is your enemy. If someone hits your mob (including the bosses), the xp goes to nothing. So, the only stage worth something would be stage 3, as long as you can kill mobs alone. It's really sad to remove more than 90% of a mob's HP, just to see someone hitting it and killing the XP.</div></div><hr />

As it stands now at lvl 35 I get about 6k from a Stage completion. From killing an elite invader I get around 6.5k. But if anyone else as much as coughs in the mobs general direction, I get 200xp. Heck, for the actual bosses I get around 56xp. That's so fucked up. Can anyone tell me if that's just a bug, or shitty design?<br />
Experience is designed that way so it prevent high level chars from power leveling low level chars and because invasions are mix of high level chars with low level chars you end up getting nothing if one high level char even touch mob you were fighting. Hopefully in few days devs realize this and patch another fix which probably will break something else. :p</div></div><hr />

Why don't we have portals everywhere? Both the Horde, and especially the alliance got some really good Mages in their arsenal. Why don't we have portals to everywhere? Why do we even have to move at all?<br />
<br />
Why didn't Jaina simply teleport the alliance off the Broken Shore? Varian's death is pretty much her fault... If we are going to use this kind of logic.<br />
<br />
Not really. Khadgar uses magical means of travel all the time. We see Jaina do it too. There is a big difference between porting a couple people and porting an entire army. I'd say as far as the lore behind it is concerned, there is obviously a good deal of magical effort involved in making a portal. We have them maintained in the cities themselves and mages can port to specific locations. But Khadgar is the best of the best and can obviously port anywhere he pleases most likely. He can certainly teleport to Karazhan on a whim. Maybe the Ulduar one is a stretch, but even then I think there is plenty to back up Khadgar of all people being able to do it.</div></div><hr />

They first hotfixed it because the xp was too low, and now they nerfed it because the xp would've been too much. They really should've thought about this when they first hotfixed it. As it is now if you're sub lvl 60 it's not very enjoyable, due to you not having flying mounts, if you're above 60 it's doable if you only play 1 alt, if you play multiple alts it's not worth it unless you're doing RAF and can summon.<br />

They don't want it to undermine their paid boost, the free value of leveling that quickly removes value from their service.</div></div><hr />

Clearly it does, or else you wouldn't have replied. And clearly you care, that others must know what you think, otherwise again, you wouldn't have said anything to begin with. I'd try some breathing, maybe a little jog in the morning, do something other then excessively masturbate over your keyboard, spreading your &quot;knowledge&quot; to others, quiet frankly I'd rather have a scalpel placed in my eye, then have to read through your so called &quot;Opinion&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I have all max level characters however I see this as a sign that Blizzard is listening and taking quicker action. The inclusion of XP for characters lower than 100 allows those who hated on WoD to participate more quickly before legion. This is a good thing.<br />

Dude. He telported an entire army, it's supplies and gear to another freaking planet in another dimension. <br />
<br />
And, the Dreanor Campaign for all intents and purposes story-wise is still ongoing, and said portals are still open between the planets (even though that storyline has been dropped completely with no mention at all) <br />
<br />
I get it, if you're a fan of the character, to put forward limitations to his power, but your excuses are in complete conflict with what that character did for an entire expansion. <br />
<br />
Personally, I agree that the entire Varion/Broken Shore story is bullshit, it's more Kosak &quot;for the feels!&quot; nonsense that rips a major lore character from the game because he can't write drama without crutches like killing someone off. It's lazy writing. The entire thing is pointless, because it just elevates a weak character as &quot;leader&quot;. And &quot;feels&quot;. A well written story would have the most important leader in Azeroth nowhere near the front lines, in the first place.</div></div><hr />
