Zul'aman<br />
The reset timer should be 3 days. <br />
Loots will have pretty much the same quality as Tier 5 loots.</div></div><hr />

Well, if the new cap is 72 for that expansion it actually does mean that you can't go higher for now, of course it's not the ULTIMATE lvl, that's something no one knows or no one can predict, not even blizz as they said they'd do this untill the game dies...</div></div><hr />

Oh well...<br />
As for the Utgarde Keep question, there's no lore behind it, but don't forget that with northrend, we are now going in a part of lore that has a rather young history (it was only explored by (Ner Zhul of course, but he doesn't count) Bronzbeard recently, and very little is known since the Lich King fused with Arthas. in other words, we are going to write history!</div></div><hr />

<br />
and as long as they do it fairly well like they did in BC with lots of instance content, its still a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just remember how it was leveling for 40 to 50 *shudder*<br />
<br />
on the flip side, with the new top level going to be level 80, i wish they would do something to speed up the levels from 30 to 58, they are as slow and from 40-50 they are even slower, quests yield a lower % of xp needed to level, not very many instances, instances take too long and are just not all that much fun...<br />
<br />
<br />
but then i suppose this wouldn't qualify as adding new content so it gets put on the back burner</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rackornar</div><div class="date">2007-08-02, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I found about the Utgarde Keep is it is inhabited by a viking race known as Vrykul. Their motive is to show how powerful they are to Arthas so he can then turn the most powerful soldiers that die into his undead minions. In any case should be an interesting and fun new dungeon.<br />
<br />
On a side note never would've guessed ZA would have loots equal to Tier 5. Guess Blizzard intends for people to be able to gear up in either 10 or 25 mans. This also provides a good motive for guilds further on in the 25 mans to comeback and see this content, sure its a 10 man but with high quality gear.</div></div><hr />

As far as you really enjoy PvE content I guess that's true, they would just do that to keep you waiting, but I wouldn't put too much effort in the gear u'll get there (badass enchants) and when xpac comes out you'll replace it all anyways before you even hit 80 (unless of course the items difference isnt anythink like preTBC and TBC loot) ;-)</div></div><hr />

If you only play to get better gear then whats the point of anything?<br />

Enjoy the challenge of a fresh instance, enjoy it while it lasts and then move onto the new content!</div></div><hr />

I doubt the item difference will be that huge, it was almost required to have such a huge difference when going to BC because of how crappy the gear you got was if you didn't raid, by making newer gear much better they provided everyone with the big increase to stam so they could lengthen those PvP skirmishes a bit and added some new types of greens that are actually decent like of the Bandit, or the Invoker. This stuff gave casuals who didn't have all the nice raid loot a chance. However raiders didn't have to worry about gear till about 65-66 so its not like Blizzard made our stuff obsolete out as soon as we stepped out of the portal.. Hell I still use my Drakefang Talisman</div></div><hr />

Yea, that's true, and I guess once you had gotten used to the BC items, they became the standard pretty quick and now people could just follow with what gear they have (decent gear is very easy to obtain, just by buying blues in the AH (imbued set etc.)).<br />
I'm just hoping they find a way to make people fight a bit more over those area buffs (Hellfire/Zan/Terok/Nagrand), the idea's good, but people don't seem to want to bother about it (on the two servers I play anyways...)</div></div><hr />

I think the world PvP objectives were really well done. Atleast on my server it was huge, well Nagrand and Terrokar, not so much hellfire or Zangasmarsh. LOL the battle to control the Bone Waste Towers would begin 15-10 minutes before they were even open to capture.</div></div><hr />

World PvP on my server has been fairly epic too, with Halla - Bone Wastes and Helfire all hotspots in the evening time, esp when most guilds stop raiding. People just show up to fight and its grown ever since TBC to the point where I've seen full raids converging on Hallaa!</div></div><hr />

Everything in this game's gonna get outdated eventually whether we like it or not. The thing blizz is doing is making sure they keep our interests at a high level so we just keep playing. New or old content doesn't matter as long as there's something each of us want to do in the game.</div></div><hr />

You can't look at things in terms of raw numbers. The level 60 example you posted is a 76.8% increase, and the level 70 example you posted was a 39.75% increase... Thats not same league at all. <br />
<br />
Also in all honesty pre-tbc was dm/ubrs loot vs naxx loot.<br />
Where as tbc is crafting/heroic/5man/pvp(and maybe even kara) vs bt/hyjal loot.. <br />
<br />
The gear gap is way way way way way way smaller now than it was then, and the same level of gear reset is not necessary. The only reason to gear reset is that they would rather piss off the haves than the have nots.</div></div><hr />

i don't know if it is already answered but... Udgard got a germanic background!<br />
<br />
the world in the germanic mythology was divided into 3 parts...asgard(home of the gods) ... midgard(home of the humans) and UDGARD ... udgard was the home of the trolls and giants.... so a really cold place where people couldn't live...sharp huge stones and just a barren land <br />

<br />
Blizzard said that they would release an expansion EVERY YEAR. meaning this one is jnuary 2008. They also said that they would only add something as major as a level cap (because it completely changes end-game play) once EVERY OTHER YEAR. meaning, either we are getting our expansion a year later than they told us, or theres no level cap past 75</div></div><hr />
