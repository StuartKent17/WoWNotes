These locales are respectively the Portuguese-Brazil and the Japanese-Japan ones, they're actually used in other Blizzard games and I guess you can check SC2Mapster - Galaxy Editor (http://wiki.sc2mapster.com/galaxy/console/) if you need a confirmation of some sort. <br />
<br />
Now you're probably going to ask me why you should care about that (unless you're Brazilian) and the answer is very simple! Remember the leaked Blizzard Product Slate (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2095-Blizzard-Product-Slate-Forum-Titles-Blizzcast-15-Blue-Posts) from a few months back? WoW Brazil was actually there, and the timing is near perfect. <br />

<br />
Things are starting to make sense and it might be safe to assume that Blizzard is still on schedule for the WoW changes, if everything works as planned we probably won't have to wait too much time before the next expansion is released and I guess the current plan is as follow: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.1 - Firelands Raid + Abyssal Maw Dungeon (Blizzcon Preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2034-Blizzcon-2010-Raids-Dungeons-Panel-Press-Trailer))<br />
Patch 4.2 - ??? (Caverns of Time: War of the Ancients (http://www.wowpedia.org/War_of_the_Ancients_%28instance%29)?)<br />
Patch 4.3 - Deathwing Raid and death<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully Patch 4.1 will hit the test realms very soon and I'll have plenty of stuff to report. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Class balance based on PTR Testing<br />
The PTR does not exist solely for balance feedback. They provide crash reports, bug reports, having the patches simply live on a test environment with people actively playing helps us catch a great number of issues that no one would even need post about. Beyond that though the bug reports that are posted are extremely helpful, and overall the PTRs lead without a doubt to a more stable patch than it would have been were there no public test.<br />
<br />
In direct answer to what you're referring, unless there's new content, the number of people on the PTR is really pretty low. Too low to pull reliable metrics to base balance changes on. Unless there's new content to drive people to the PTR there generally just isn't a sample size. Which is fine, because we can make changes after the PTR once the patch hits the live realms. Issuing hotfixes after a patch is by no means something new. We've used hotfixes for quite a long time, but since Cataclysm and the new community site, hotfix changes are front page news through the blogs. Which is awesome. Before we were throwing out pretty much the same amount of hotfixes we were after 4.0.6. Difference being we didn't have a great way to tell anyone about them. So now hotfixes are very visible and it makes it seem like we're going crazy with them, when really it's just increased transparency into the changes we're making.<br />
<br />
Going back to your question, the PTR does many great things for the patches, and it should be expected that we're not going to make balance changes based on forum posts alone. The designers don't believe their own play experience is reason enough to make balance changes, although it can be one part of the puzzle, and the same goes for us reading about yours.

<br />
I don't understand, if 15 hunters are saying on PTR that deterrence is not working correctly, shouldn't that be enough to look into it?<br />
15 people saying there is a issue vs 150 saying there is an issue, they could still look into it.<br />
What about pets spawning at 5k health for 5 seconds? How many &quot;reliable metrics&quot; do they need to fix these issues.<br />
<br />
If what we currently have is without a doubt more stable than what it would be I would hate to see a patch without a PTR.</div></div><hr />

Come on, it's just a planned schedule. At work we also do it all the time, and we always have a few months delay. So expect WoW 4 to arrive in september 2012 and not in 12 months.</div></div><hr />

This is true, but their expansion timeframe has always shifted a lot (I mean, look at Cataclysm's release date shift).<br />

CoT might be there, but we can also expect a water-themed raid.<br />

The theme of the expansion is the Elements. 4 elements, 4 patches. We already have Air in 4.0, we get Fire in 4.1, 4.3 with Neltharion is obviously Earth... which means Water must come in 4.2.<br />

Do note that Q1-4 Starts from April the first month of the Financial year. So for example Diablo 3 is marked for Q4 of 2011. That means its going to be released between Jan - Mar of 2012. My guess is March 2012, tho I really wish the game would come out this year in Nov. I'm pretty sure the new expansion will arrive in Q3-Q4 of 2012 which could mean going into 2013 which would make sense anyway. 2 years between each expansion is Blizzards usual pattern.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to Wow mechanics brah<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
392% and 351% INCREASED movement speed, not 392% and 351% OF normal movement speed. I don't know why you subtracted 100% from both results.<br />
<br />
Also; 492/451 = 1.090909090909 repeating = 12/11. Just because a paladin (or frost (or is it unholy?) death knight) moves 41% of normal movement speed faster than others, it doesn't mean they move 41% faster than others. They move one eleventh faster. An even easier calculation would be 120% / 110% of &quot;normal mount speed&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is the same reason I hate when people say &quot;shamans got a 15% healing buff&quot;. No they didn't. They already had a passive 10% boost, meaning 110% of &quot;normal healing&quot;. Increasing the boost by 15% to 25%, they now have 125% of &quot;normal healing&quot;. 125/110 = 1.1363636 repeating = 13.63636% = 3/22 increase.</div></div><hr />

Nope. In the US the fiscal year begins on October the 1st. (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_year#United_States)<br />
<br />
On the product slate, Q1 means from January 1st to March 31st. That's all, nothing fancy. But that doesn't mean WoWx4 will be released before June 2012, they will be late obviously, this date was just given as a very optimistic estimate to please shareholders. WoWx4 will be released between Q3 and Q4 more probably.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't worry about it. Blizzard's plan has been to attempt to release an expansion every year once they launched The Burning Crusade. Well, you see how well that plan's gone. Don't put much stock in the release date of WoW patches/expansions. <br />
<br />
I do, however, find it interesting that jaJP was added to WoW. Does anyone know how thorough these localizations are? Is it just IME support for Japanese characters, or the full shebang?<br />
<br />
Because, if it's the real deal like Chinese WoW, I wonder how much tighter Square Enix's asshole can pucker.</div></div><hr />

Acti-Blizz specifically mentions in last year's call their fiscal year ends on the calender year (http://www.industrygamers.com/news/wow-call-of-duty-drive-activision-blizzards-sales-to-428-billion-in-09/)</div></div><hr />

392% and 351% INCREASED movement speed, not 392% and 351% OF normal movement speed. I don't know why you subtracted 100% from both results.<br />
<br />
Also; 492/451 = 1.090909090909 repeating = 12/11. Just because a paladin (or frost (or is it unholy?) death knight) moves 41% of normal movement speed faster than others, it doesn't mean they move 41% faster than others. They move one eleventh faster. An even easier calculation would be 120% / 110% of &quot;normal mount speed&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is the same reason I hate when people say &quot;shamans got a 15% healing buff&quot;. No they didn't. They already had a passive 10% boost, meaning 110% of &quot;normal healing&quot;. Increasing the boost by 15% to 25%, they now have 125% of &quot;normal healing&quot;. 125/110 = 1.1363636 repeating = 13.63636% = 3/22 increase.<br />

According to the article you just linked, Blizzard &quot;is on a fiscal that matches to calendar. They made the switch during their merger with Vivendi.&quot;<br />

<br />
It's not down for the second month in 2012, but the second quarter, which is Apr-Jun. So there's 14-16 months to go. <br />
<br />
Also most guilds don't progress through hardmode :)<br />
<br />
Also also a lot of guilds are making a lot of progress in just two months - according to wowprogress, 10% of guilds who have dipped their toe in have at least hit the hardmodes, which is more than killed the Lich King hardmode, and they had a year and a 30% buff and sweet elemental gear right at the end.<br />
<br />
Also also also it'll get a lot easier to get geared up for most guilds. At the moment a lot of people are struggling at getting out of heroics: they can take a lot of time and the JP results are the ilvl 346, the same as the heroics are geared for. Once you start getting 359/372/385 gear from the JPs, heroics in general will be a lot easier, you'll not be throwing away 90 minutes and wiping on the last boss, and so it'll be a few days' instead of a few weeks to get up to raiding strength. And with the saved time, more crafting, more dailies, better gems and enchants. Now of course the people who are struggling at heroics now are probably not going to be downing Sinestra until 5.0 comes out, but at least they'll get to see the raids.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to Wow mechanics brah<br />
<br />
In any case, the guy who said paladins with crusader aura are only going 10% faster than people with mount up *not quite* correct. <br />
<br />
To provide a simple example. If one player is going at 220% of normal speed and another at 240% of normal speed (using ground mounts to make the example simple for you), there may be a 20% gap from 220 to 240, however in terms of actual speed output, the paladin with crusader aura is going just a fraction under 9.0909090909091% faster than the guy with just mount up.<br />
<br />
U can easily confirm this with a calculator by going 220 x 1.0909090909091 or far more simply 240 / 220</div></div><hr />

Its the localisation that is in it. Perhaps they are releasing brazilian realms in q3? This simply proves that WoW Brazil (whether it just points to a localisation or new realms in brazil) is coming out. Its one of the things on the list we wouldnt have known anything about without the list and it does indeed show that this list contains leaked information rather than being a complete hoax although we still can only wait until official announcements to be sure :).</div></div><hr />

Datamining a locale identifier in an .exe is very different from an official release. But since apparently you're pretty mean and you can't really understand what I say, let me translate for you: <br />
<br />
HERP DERP ONLY DATAMINING, RELEASE FAR FAR! JUST 0 AND 1 IN LITTLE CART!<br />

Blizzard wasn't afraid to push Cataclysm back despite the hordes of angry fans.<br />
<br />
Are you on crack. There were so many in beta/ptr begging them NOT to release it because it wasn't ready. The only people that could have possibly not wanted it released were ones who hadn't tested it. Cata went live with more bugs than I thought were possible for a game from blizzard. This is from a person that has been playing blizz games since warcraft orcs and humans. I felt very disappointed at the amount of bugs that were in the game when WOTLK went live, and Cata certainly shattered all of the records of WotLK including releasing with way more bugs. There were characters that couldn't access entire zones. Not just one or two quests. <br />
<br />
They should have pushed Cata back to at least a mid jan release, but I understand that as a company they needed the big increase it gave them. I don't hate blizz for making business decisions. Anyway, they should have waited till a mid Jan/early Feb release. Then they maybe would have had time to add some of the things they promised, or just not cut so much that they did.<br />

With the 2nd and 3rd tiers, it will be much easier to get characters geared up because heroics will be 15 minute facerolls again. In order to buy valor gear now, you have to do long heroics that often lead in wipes and ragequits. Tier 2 comes in April, Tier 3 comes in October... that gives people 6 months at each tier, which is a long time. Wowx4 coming in April 2012 sounds about right</div></div><hr />

Well, wowprogress again says there's about 45k guilds raiding today, 85k in ICC. But it's also got 55k in Ulduar, and it doesn't go back further than that. I'd like to see a comparison against guilds raiding in 3.0, Naxx/Sarth/Maly, about two months after LK came out. <br />

Yeah, sorry my irritation isn't at you. It's more in that I was very excited about cataclysm and I really feel like they let their long term fans down. That's a bit of sting when a company you consider to be really good does something like that. I'm sure it wasn't their fault, like I said they have expenses and needed to get it out. I'm also sure you are right. The people running the company now don't care about how fans view it. They just want to see an increase in money. <br />

Near perfect? It's half a year off! How does February-March mean 3rd Quarter of 2011? Are you just calling it whatever you want just so you can seem right?<br />

Also is this really gonna be WoW Brazil, it's own region, or just a Portuguese language version, still with the US/Latin American servers?</div></div><hr />

You might want to change the bolded part into Portuguese, because Brazilian Portuguese applies to Brazil, Portugal, Mozambique, etc. The Brazilian part it's just a way to distinguish some changes from actual Portuguese to Brazilian Portuguese.<br />

<br />
Let me just correct you, the Brazilian Portuguese is only speak in Brazil, others countries that speak Portuguese, speak the Portugal Portuguese, that is way more traditional, and for that reason is way different, in grammar, spelling, and even vocabulary...so the information is right, that only cares if you are brazilian....for example you can check the Brazilian version of SC2, that is all translated, with cinematic sync, to the Brazilian Portuguese.<br />

Actually you can find in a bookstore (for me that live in Curitiba, we have the Livrarias Curitiba) all the versions of WoW, and the more expensive, that is the Cataclysm, is sold for R$ 95,00, something around US$ 55,00.<br />

wow brazil likely will be the same as wow latin america. realms and accounts in US but with a Portuguese client. not much to it really is just a translation.<br />
<br />
That is exactly what I was thinking...they will not add a new server inside Brazil, they will just keep the servers located in US and will have a client version in portuguese...probably everything will be in portuguese (voices included) but not a new server...</div></div><hr />

If that's true i don't know why blizzard is even bothering. There is already a large brazilian playerbase playing on US servers. Most wouldn't move unless the change brings a decrease in latency. Now if there were servers in Brazil and free transfers when it launchs i can see wowbr starting with 7-8 populated servers.</div></div><hr />

It IS possible to fight someone and kill them without killing them for good, y'know.<br />
<br />
Just look at Onyxia, Onyxia again, Nefarian, All of Naxxramas + Patchwerk again, Ragnaros, Baron Geddon, Kael'thas Sunstrider, Anub'arak, The Black Knight, The Black Knight again, The Black Knight for a third time, and Saurfang. All of these guys have been killed and brought back to fight again. Similar to Ragnaros, we could simply kill an avatar of him, which banishes him back to the twisting nether or whatever the hell happened. I need to read up on the War of the Ancients.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heck .. if it was about language they could just make a translation and call it a day. Its about servers and market. People from portugal play on EU servers, which is closer. <br />
<br />
People from brazil play on US servers, since there are no servers nearby. The only ones are Latin America servers which are in spanish (believe or not, no .. we dont speak spanish and for 99% of us it's easier to speak english than spanish). <br />
<br />
The only way they would get those servers populated would be a mass free transfer for them .. for 2 reasons: <br />
<br />
1. Because of the currency difference, most people would not pay to transfer. <br />
2. There's a lot of players, myself included that simply rather play on US servers and english version of the game .. simply because they always do a horrible job in translating the game. Expressions and slangs change from language to language ... an expression in english that is raw translated to portuguese, makes no sense .. because we have a completely different expression to say that. <br />
<br />
That's is where they fucked up on SC2 brazilian version .. its simply horrible. Sure it's a 1st step .. but for me .. and 100% of the people i know from here that play wow/sc2, is flat out stupid. <br />
<br />
I rather play with 150 ms in an US server than with 50ms in a horrible version of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Blizzard already has a fairly strong presence in Brazil. All it's PC games since at least and Warcraft 2 have been released here, with WoW being the single, glaring, omission. The games were often translated/dubbed also, without any option to play them in the original language (which made me &quot;pirate&quot; the games by buying the local version but downloading and using the original, English, version; I can't stand their translations, specially the voices).<br />
<br />
- Support times should not increase. Phone support for Portuguese-speaking WoW players is already handled locally (even though the game has not been officially announced for Brazil), and even for tickets the response time should get better for everyone, since for obvious reasons support in Portuguese will not be handled by the English-speaking support crew.<br />
<br />
- Blizzard will probably not provide local servers. AFAIK, &quot;local&quot; Starcraft servers are located in the US, much like WoW servers for Latin America and Oceania.<br />
<br />
- I sure hope Blizzard gets the pricing down to at least parity with the US. A few distributors are already dealing with WoW and it's expansions, by providing imported boxes, but for the time being they cost about double the US prices.<br />
<br />
- While WoW might get enough local players to justify the local presence, in the short and medium term it will most likely remain under the shadow of a number of other MMOs that were brought here during the last half decade and already have a firm grasp on the market. The cost of WoW, with all it's expansions, should also be a big concern; MMOs that do well here are the ones that don't charge for the game itself, only charging the players for either game time or store cash.</div></div><hr />

Well considering how fast people plow through the content I'd say it is fine and highly welcome to get a lot of new content in less then one year. I almost died from boredom when I finished ICC so many times and had nothing to do for more then half a year, the new sanctum didn't help much, so I just canceled my sub, until few weeks before Cataclysm - and I would guess that's how most raiders feel. We get bored real quickly. <br />
<br />
I'm pretty much bored with content we have right now, if I'm not raiding, I do a daily heroic, maybe some daily quests (if I need something) and then I hang 1-2 hours in Orgrimmar (like I did in Dalaran) and wait for a raid. On non-raid days I don't even log into the game and the xpac is what... 3 months old.</div></div><hr />

Actaully the Latin America servers are located in US, so there is no option of a better server for us, in Brazil...they will do exactly what they did with SC2, translate and put us under the Latin America tab, with servers running in US still...</div></div><hr />

I agree with you. If this is anywhere near accurate, I feel that raid content will be pushed at a pace that few butthe most hardcore of guilds will be able to stay with the highest level of content.<br />
<br />
Even Boub hoping for 4.1 on the PTRs soon is causing me concern right now. Has there really been enough guilds beating the current raid content enough to warrent pushing 4.1 so soon? I don't know, doesn't feel like it though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This pacing isn't bad at all, considering that the majority of guilds that are willing to bash their heads against hardmode encounters repeatedly are currently in the process of finishing up their progression - there is probably at least another month before anything new comes out which will probably give these guilds the time they need to finish this stuff up. This is VASTLY preferable to the Fail of the Lich King's HORRIFIC pacing (I really can not stress enough how bad it was) which left a large number of raiding guilds with nothing to do except farm encounters they had already completed for half year+ before being able to commit to anything new (many guilds broke up in this dead time).<br />
<br />
More casual 'play more for fun' guilds, while they may not be thrilled with the idea of new content coming out before they can finish *everything* from this tier with current gear levels, probably will not be too upset over it either. Hardcore guilds will have something new to work on rather than farming the same hardmode encounters for like half a year.</div></div><hr />

That is six months in advance of what the chart says. That's a long time in the gaming community.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2011-02-22, 02:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How is the timing almost perfect? They are about 5-6 months off. That chart shows Brazil in the 3rd quarter not the 3rd month. Also depending on how blizz runs, a lot of people run fiscal years which are beginning in october(the military does for one) which might put that a little closer but i doubt it.<br />

The reading comprehension on these boards is just terrible. This was datamined information. Blizzard hasn´t announced anything yet and it certainly isn´t going live in the next few weeks. They will definitely market it and ... possibly.... even actualy mention it somewhere themselves before it goes live. This is just datamined information... we have no idea when it will be implemented, although it stands to reason that it is somewhere between a few months, to maybe 6 months.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also heard that SC2x2 has been delayed, is this graph before the announcement or after?</div></div><hr />

Guess it happened.<br />
<br />
Also as per the blue post. <br />
<br />
<br />
Problem is that list was available for months, so that poster is full of crap.</div></div><hr />

Not even close. It shows up in the 3rd quarter on that list, and we're only in 1st.<br />
But then again, Blizzard never did something on time, so ~6 months difference may be near perfect timing ...</div></div><hr />

Ppl will switch to Rift and in 1-3 months will switch back to wow, just to find out that they are out of their guilds and/or their raid groups. So my advise is if you intend to come check next contents , do not go to Rift. The same happened when Aion came, ppl played for couple of months and then returned to WoW. They only games i am looking for this year are Diablo 3 and SC2:Phoenix and SC2:2exp, but there is no need to quit wow to play them.</div></div><hr />

But since apparently you're pretty mean and you can't really understand what I say, let me translate for you: <br />
<br />
HERP DERP ONLY DATAMINING, RELEASE FAR FAR! JUST 0 AND 1 IN LITTLE CART!<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, the whole thing isn't about predicting release dates (well, not entirely), it's about predicting a Brazil localization nobody ever heard of.<br />

<br />
I am not content with Warsong. There are some Brazilians that doesn't play there neither in Gurubashi-US. I am just worried about this Brazilian realms... I know it is good to have some realms with my own language, but I think 99% of the Brazilians playing WoW knows how to speak English, if they don't, why the fuck are they playing? To see some colorful fire bolts and shiny gears ? And well... I don't want to be obligated to transfer my characters from Illidan-US to a stupid new realm, with lots of newbies. World of Warcraft is old and well... I don't expect more than 1 expansion to Blizzard abandon this project and replace it for some new project. (&quot;World of Starcraft&quot;derp)</div></div><hr />
