Burning Treant Form<br />
Druids with Glyph of the Treant (http://www.wowdb.com/items/68039-glyph-of-the-treant) got a nice little upgrade in Patch 5.1. Anytime they stand near a Cozy Fire (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/7358-cozy-fire) in Treant form, they will catch on fire! <br />

Battleground Queues and Addons<br />
This is in response to an addon that allowed players to form full cross realm premades by all queueing at the same time. <br />
In patch 5.1, we resolved some issues regarding how Addons interact with the Battleground queue system. It is no longer possible to automate queuing for standard or random Battlegrounds in groups larger than 5. We decided to make this change in order to improve the experience for all players who are queueing into random groups normally and expecting to face similarly random groups, only to find themselves crushed by a full team of coordinated opponents.<br />
<br />
We understand that players want to enjoy coordinated team play, and we invite those players to queue into Rated Battlegrounds or play Wargames to have that experience. Players can continue to use Addons to queue for Rated Battlegrounds as well. <br />

LFR Boss Status<br />
The CM's on the US forum are telling me I should complete the LFR for VP anyway, even if I have killed that boss, but why, if I do one heroic a day and 5 LFR's that VP caps me (unless the cap has risen which I have not seen anything on) so why would i want more vp from a boss I've already killed even if that is possible which I don't think you get extra VP for killing a boss twice in one LFR lock out.<br />
You get extra VP for finishing the LFR run you've been placed in, no matter if you've killed the final boss of that run yet or not (you just get 90 VP for the first completion and 45 for all the others).<br />
<br />
Getting a queue pop for the last boss only, then queing again for the first 2, only to get the !@#$%^- last boss again.<br />
If you get into an ongoing run and finish it, next time you queue, the system will try to put you on a fresh run. It's not 100% guaranteed, but that's what the game will try to do, rather than have you going against the same last boss again.<br />
<br />
Does it mean you might end up keep getting 2/3 bosses LFRs? Or will you be sure to get a fresh run if you already killed the last one?<br />
It might not be 100% sure, but that's what the Raid Finder will try to do. <br />
<br />
But to give zero reward for staying in a group with absolutley no benefit to yourself is idiotic especially since you already took a hit first time and joined a 2/3 raid and to even punish those people is even worse.<br />
If you finish that second run, you'll get Valor Points for it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/246599-why-we-need-to-see-lfr-boss-status/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5967569028?page=1#17))<br />

Old World Boss Changes<br />
Are you sure? I was killed immediately when I was inside C'thun!<br />
Viscidus, Twin Emperors, C'Thun, Al'ar and Reliquary of Souls should be easier to kill now. The developers applied a hotfix during the night. So, if you haven't gone to C'Thun yet today, you should!<br />
<br />
Why don't you change Kalecgos? And what are the changes at Al'ar?<br />
Al'ar is no longer immune to fire damage.<br />
<br />
Regarding Kalecgos, at this point we don't know if the developers have any plans to change him or any other bosses, but we'll ask them and share with you any news if that's the case.<br />
<br />
Yes, as paladin, I am interested in Viscidus changes as well.<br />
He's now easier to freeze and shatter. <br />
<br />
RoS won't cast Spirit Shock as often as before. <br />
<br />
What about Razorgore? Last time i was in there i noticed his destroy egg ability had no cooldown and that you didn't lose channeltime if hit. But it was still impossible due to the amount of adds that spawn, before you even get to clear half the room Razorgore is dead.<br />
I'd say you need to practice the most effective path and use his ability to sleep dragonkins. Razorgore can also take quite a beating, but at some point you'll need to clear adds off yourself and himself (careful of not blowing him up).

Daily Quest Feedback<br />
Go talk to some congas, Mr. Brown. Your opinion is irrelevant.<br />
Why is it irrelevant? I'm a player too. :(<br />
<br />
The more I did the Mists dailies, especially after hitting Revered with Golden Lotus -- that can be a little tedious -- the more I actually enjoyed them. I've never been a huge fan of daily quests, but I seriously like the Mists factions (and dailies) more than any before them. I think there's a nice variety in the setup of each faction's daily quests (i.e. Klaxxi buffs, Shado-Pan companion, etc.) that doesn't make it feel too redundant. This is particularly true since I tend to rotate through a couple of factions week to week. With my work/life schedule I'm someone who doesn't always cap Valor each week, so I know I don't need to do dailies every day if it just means I'll outpace my VP gains. Right now I have at least 3 pieces of epic gear unlocked reputation-wise that I just need to save up for.<br />
<br />
While technically you are a player in that you play the game, your opinion and the way you voice it is your job.<br />
Hold up...<br />
<br />
Let's get one thing straight. Sure, I work for Blizzard so you can accuse me of bias. But my opinions about the game aren't owned or operated by Blizzard, nor is it the development team's job to dictate to me what my opinions should be. I form my opinions about gameplay the same way as everyone else, though certainly inside info does shape them to a degree (almost always in a positive way like, &quot;OMG, early patch 5.2 design is looking mind blowing!&quot;).<br />
<br />
As far as enjoying the monotonous dailies the more you do them, I have absolutely no idea how that is possible. Every time I do one daily I feel my blood pressure rise along with my anger at the devs, CM's and people who defend the boring dailies.<br />
Playing off of what I said above, I'll tell you how it's possible. We're discussing subjective elements of what is or isn't fun in a video game.<br />
<br />
You and I disagree, and that's okay. But at least I acknowledge that your opinion of dailies is &quot;possible&quot; and understandable. In return it seems you're suggesting that the reason I have the opinion I do is that it's not my own -- that it was somehow force-fed to me.<br />
<br />
Look, I've typically shouted down the &quot;dailies are mandatory&quot; whiners ... but for one reason only -- they didn't take much effort and I was able to &quot;get rid of them&quot; quickly. I'd probably feel differently if I actually cared about maintaining an alt.<br />
<br />
But let's be honest, questing is the lowest form of content. It is boring, repetitive and not challenging. Dailies, in and of themselves, are just a miserable lowlight in what is an otherwise impressive array of content in MoP. The raiding, challenge modes, brawler's guild, pet battles etc. have all been excellent. Dailies? Not so much.<br />
I just totally disagree. Solo content has come such a long way since vanilla. There are many players out there and in this thread, like me, who enjoy approaching an area filled with quest objectives, looking for the most interesting and efficient ways of tackling those objectives.<br />
<br />
You can easily get yourself in gameplay situations that, while maybe a lot shorter in length, are mechanically more interesting than several Raid Finder boss fights, and require more than just your best standard ability rotation. Hell, there are mobs out there that have nearly as many mechanics/abilities as some of the Raid Finder bosses.<br />
<br />
When I hit Revered with Golden Lotus I moved onto other factions while waiting for the 5.1 commendations to come out. My gear has improved quite a lot since I hit Revered and, when I went back to do Golden Lotus dailies last night, had more fun than usual pushing myself to be precise, ambitious, and ruthless with pulls. <br />
<br />
My enjoyment of Mists of Pandaria has only increased over time, even with the few gripes I've had. I couldn't say the same back in Cataclysm. I still think it was a solid expansion, and I appreciate a lot of what Cataclysm brought to the game, but I sympathized with the people who were feeling burned out. For me, it just felt like maybe it was the result of playing this game for so long. I worried a little bit that my feelings for World of Warcraft were becoming inevitably nostalgic. But Mists changed that for me. The content feels like it just has more soul to it. I've seen a lot of people express similar feelings.<br />
<br />
On that note, to the people who outright refuse to pickup quests from a hub with blue exclamation points: you're missing out on some great story and awesome content at Domination Point and Lion's Landing. I think it's a mistake to write that off based on perception alone.

Powershot Bugs<br />
Just wanted to keep you guys updated, we're aware of this issue (when targeting a stationary target), it's already being worked on but unfortunately it's the kind of bug that will probably only be fixed with a client-side patch, probably with 5.2 (please note that this is a very early estimation of when it’s going to get fixed, don’t take it for granted as it might change at any time) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/246601-want-a-blue-on-powershot/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5967569042?page=1#10))<br />

Interesting how they changed their mind on that. Before they said it was pointless to combat because it was no different than a raid collaborating on voice chat and queuing at the same time. I wonder if other changes have been made to the queue system that they haven't told us...</div></div><hr />

Shame Blood DK's didn't get a fix for AOE having to sacrifice survival for AOE threat is a pain in the ass in some heroic modes (have to let our druid take the duel add role on stone guards for example)<br />
<br />
Still want to see a Blood DK fix for spike damage also the extra HP does not cut it. They need to make boneshield perm and turn it into a sort of block that mastery increases and remove the blood shield or something.</div></div><hr />

I think the Felfire for us Warlocks was to be a long questline and if that's correct- then I'd like to think it takes a lot of effort to make a questline for it rather than &quot;just&quot; popping in a single animation for a Druid Glyph. : )</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, you're absolutely right. I was using a Straw Man just to make a point. There's nothing wrong with the animation, and I will likely use it on my druid (though it'd be cooler if it was in ANY and ALL fires, not just the campfire). I just wanted to point out that it was rather irrelevant and erroneous to the current &quot;needs and desires&quot; of the community.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't &quot;stop&quot; it although it does just add a roadblock to it. Rath strat premades are still gonna happen, they'll just find another work around.

Very good change and very welcome :D<br />
<br />
I don't think that it's a good change. There are many many bots around than it was a year ago. When you are playing 10man BG and there about 5 bots in your team - it's not fun.<br />
<br />
I know, it's not fun eather to lose vs a premade team, but still, why punish it? It's like Blizzard giving green light to all bots, that they could play vs eachother in BG's more freely. It disgust me to play BG with or against bots. In place of fixing addons they could do a better job by punishing all those nasty bot-users more frequently.</div></div><hr />

Fuck off developers you guys just suck. I guess I'm just mad for re-rolling, I should have stuck with my paladin or gone with a druid, all they ever get is more cool shit.<br />

You get extra VP for finishing the LFR run you've been placed in, no matter if you've killed the final boss of that run yet or not (you just get 90 VP for the first completion and 45 for all the others).&quot;<br />
<br />
Serious question, are the blues mentally challenged? Maybe held back a couple years in elementary school? It's like he didn't understand any of the words in the statement. He has no clue what VP capped means, probably because they don't actually play the game so terminology is hard. It seems he only understood the second part of the sentence. <br />
<br />
They should keep the combustion nerf, it was needed. They really need to revert the cm change. Overkill and ruins the fun of the spec, I don't care about the numbers being nerfed, I care about spamming fireball and waiting forever for a heating up. It's boring. If I wanted to spam one button I'd go arcane.</div></div><hr />

The only thing we were good at was raid spam healing with Uplift. And they repeatedly hammer our ability to single target heal or conserve mana.<br />
<br />
And I love how they gave us some buffs during the last big nerfed, only to take those buffs away right afterwards. Classy.<br />
<br />
I quit healing, going back to DPS. I'm sick of being punished because of PvP.</div></div><hr />

I enjoyed frost but the damage is still too weak. I'm getting tired of the dance they do with pvp and pve balance. Just be done with it like so many other MMOs have done successfully and make spells work differently in PvP. They've done this a handful of times in past (and that's not including all CC which has different rulesets) but they're so piss afraid of moving forward because they want to believe that players would be too fucking stupid to handle the change.</div></div><hr />

Sheer nonsense. The game is already losing subs and more and more viable competitors are on the horizon, not to mention every other game out there which is automatically competition for Blizzard. They don't automatically earn the money, either. The sooner you learn that, the better.<br />

When was the last time you played arcane? The spec hasn't been a 1 button spec since MoP. The combustion nerf is still excessive.</div></div><hr />

lol ? the only reason blizz is making money is because of their subs and players, your a fail if u undervalue customers. fire mages been in leading position for long, i quited before i saw what monks can do, so i cant really comment on them. so other then that mages should be nerfed, for once in their life after TBC mages should use some skill in pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fire was overall totally overpowered, outscaling everything else bei far ( even frost and arcane), high mobility, high cleave damage. In the end, they were already topping the metres by far - although they are a range specc. Next nerf should be to combat rogues cleave.<br />
<br />
For those asking why fire mages needed a nerf:<br />
<br />
http://raidbots.com/dpsbot/Overall_DPS/25H/all/7/30/default/#5fvjj<br />
<br />
The better gear got, the more dominat mages got. I hope for a combat cleave nerf since it only leads to a new wave of class stacking.<br />
<br />
I hope that we now have the choice between fire, frost and arcane. Arcane should have highest single target dps, fire highest cleave and frost - well, should be some what in the middle. Fire should be slightly lower on single target dps.</div></div><hr />

Then join them for rated battlegrounds which is where pre-mades belong. They only changed it for the random bgs where, you know, random people queue and aren't connected by mumble or vent.</div></div><hr />

Lol yet another retard stating there is WoW Killers out there,every MMO comes out,gets hyped up,then fails miserably,the sooner you learn THAT the better. And yeh its losing subs,sure,just because a few whiners leave the game due to throwing their toys out the pram because it doesnt cater to their needs,who cares let em go they dont deserve to play Warcraft anyways,let em go play something simpler like hide and seek IN HD!</div></div><hr />
