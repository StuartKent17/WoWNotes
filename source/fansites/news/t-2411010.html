Patch Notes<br />
Coming Soon<br />
<br />
Don’t Forget: Update Your Drivers!<br />
To make the most of Battle for Azeroth and avoid potential issues, it’s important to update to the latest DirectX 12 drivers. Please note that AMD and Intel GPUs will default to DX12, while NVIDIA drivers will remain at DX11 with the option to update at a later time.<br />
<br />
There’s more to come in the days ahead, and it won’t be long until the Battle for Azeroth expansion launches in the Americas, Europe, Taiwan, Korea, and Australia/New Zealand simultaneously on August 14*.

<br />
As a stand alone profession it makes no sense. Bandages still exist as part of other professions in BfA. This why a lot of people were farming the field medic achievement and title. It goes away with 8.0 as well. Still time to farm those quest drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair it makes more sense with it being tossed into tailoring. I mean they use cloth. Might as well use that cloth to make bandages too.<br />
<br />
Although as a lone profession it didn't have much worth anymore sadly.</div></div><hr />

Well would you rather them not do so and have people complain more about losing something as huge as this?<br />
<br />
As long as I get to keep a couple of my Resto ones I'm happy. Although we finally get fucking Earth Shield back at long last so I'm more than happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, they have? I don't know what's funny. Have you looked at your artifact? 90% of it just spell x does more crit, spell x does more damage, spell x heals slightly more. Etc. The only thing we really lose with artifact are the gold traits and while they were fun, they aren't gamebreaking dps loss especially considering we were buffed in other areas to compensate (at level 120 with azerite gear and heart of azeroth)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not really pushing though....they are just trying to give some kind of incentive for the people who already care about it. If they were 'pushing' it then there would be a desirable reward that even people who dislike pvp would want - I don't see any of that here, they aren't dangling any crazy rewards over our heads that make people feel forced to participate in pvp.</div></div><hr />

Kinda the same with me. Feral's is pretty strong, a shadow second copy of my rip. But the proc rate is so low. I've killed Argus rares with 250m health solo and only had it happen once or twice.<br />

I find BGs boring. I've always liked WPvP (which is somewhat active even today in leveling zones where flying doesn't exist) because it takes people out of their safe zone and breaks the monotony of questing or grinding. That can't happen in a PvP game because everyone there is only there to PvP - what I want is a game with both.</div></div><hr />

It is very bad. For example, arcane power from a mage lasts 10 sec. -1.5 sec you have 8.5 sec left to cast your spells. That's ridiculous.<br />
When you have to activate three power boost abilities than you have to click 4,5 sec until you can start making damage. That's even more ridiculous.<br />

They should have implemented a different &quot;GCD&quot; only for these type of abilities. So you can't macro them but you can still use 1 and cast.</div></div><hr />

When they announced the last quest from magni and unlocked it they said that the artifact weapon would have a power up for 2 weeks in a row and then deactivate, meaning, the 17th.</div></div><hr />

Yeah - I was leaving out speculation of dates, and looking at the only SPECIFIC date given for the system change. Which was the 10th.<br />
<br />

Yeah that can be seen as a posible date, but nothing that said that definetly will be that date, also, there is a pvp tournament (or something like this) the 14th-15th, and we knew about that event before the magni quests. That was what discarded the 10th for me.<br />

2 weeks of powering up, the 3rd and the 10th, and then it deactivates, the 17th. I'm at work and can't look for the announcement, but it pretty much said that.</div></div><hr />

Have you looked at your artifact? 90% of it just spell x does more crit, spell x does more damage, spell x heals slightly more. Etc. The only thing we really lose with artifact are the gold traits and while they were fun, they aren't gamebreaking dps loss especially considering we were buffed in other areas to compensate (at level 120 with azerite gear and heart of azeroth)<br />

My main trait was Ebonbolt, a standalone castable spell dealing a huge ton of dmg. So taking that away wouldn't go unnoticed.</div></div><hr />

Uhm no they don't.<br />
<br />
They would not be pulling DX9 and 32 bit support if they weren't sure of it. I imagine through system specs people post on Battle.net and other factors they have a good estimate of people who run a 32 bit OS.<br />
<br />
Just like Square Enix when they ended PS3 support for FF14. They would not have done it if they weren't sure that the PS3 userbase was a minority.<br />
<br />
And if you are running DX9/32 bit specs in 2018 for gaming then that's your fault. Not theirs. Especially considering they've made it known for a good amount of time they were dropping the support.<br />
<br />
A lot of devs had already phased out 32 bit/DX9 support for games because it's already an ancient relic. The fact Blizzard kept supporting it for so long is amazing.</div></div><hr />

No. It will more than likely be reduced to an extremely low drop rate like the drops from Garrosh and Archimonde.<br />

<br />
Well they should have done it with the 8 months. It's no different from what they did with the War Wolf.<br />
<br />
I mean why not get it straight away? It's just a Heroic one time kill. Your statement implies the person would have been playing within those 8 months. If they were geared then it's just as simple as joining a pug for it with how stupidly easy Argus was. <br />
<br />
I got my Moose straight away so it was done. Plus I actually like that mount. :)<br />
<br />
However it's odd. Because this is a drop one like the Warden. The Warden however was not removed until the start of Legion. So it might not actually be removed come pre patch.</div></div><hr />

It would have been if it was being removed with the pre patch but it's cool, Blizz have confirmed they're not removing it until the 14th of August anyway. Which is good because like I said there would have been a lot of rage if it was removed with zero notice lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good. Makes sense since they didn't with the Grove Warden either. I imagine this is the trend going forward now. Mythic mounts become insanely low drop rates and the Heroic drop one that everyone gets is there until the start of the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Extremely is debatable. <br />

I've not used it since Wrath. And even then I only used it because I was new to the game.<br />

Levelled all 3 and not used First Aid once on them. In fact two of those classes recently as a matter of fact. Nightborne Mage and a Void Elf Rogue.<br />
<br />
It really isn't as helpful as you are making it out to be dude.<br />

If they were 'pushing' it then there would be a desirable reward that even people who dislike pvp would want - I don't see any of that here, they aren't dangling any crazy rewards over our heads that make people feel forced to participate in pvp.<br />
<br />
To be fair, there are going to be supply drops. Isn't that dangling rewards? At least while leveling anyway.</div></div><hr />

Have you looked at your artifact? 90% of it just spell x does more crit, spell x does more damage, spell x heals slightly more. Etc. The only thing we really lose with artifact are the gold traits and while they were fun, they aren't gamebreaking dps loss especially considering we were buffed in other areas to compensate (at level 120 with azerite gear and heart of azeroth)<br />
<br />
Some specs viability at end-game revolved around a core ability that the artifact gave them, not just the increase in stats/ spell effectiveness. Affliction Warlock was one of them. If those core abilities aren't bakes in as well, those classes will definitely feel it.</div></div><hr />

Any reason why? <br />
<br />
I'd like to know outside of Artifact traits some of which are being merged into talents and whatnot where is there more being removed than added?<br />
<br />
Please enlighten me. Because most things that are being removed are being replaced such as War Mode replacing the PvP server archetype. Artifacts are being replaced with the Azerite Armor pieces in BFA.<br />
<br />
You made a claim that more things are being removed than added. So far I don't see it which is why I asked you to elaborate. If not I'll just assume you have nothing to back up your wild claim.<br />
<br />
The only two small things that I know are going are the Mage Tower appearances which is keeping in line with the system of timed rewards in WoW and Legendaries from what I recall got a lot of criticism thrown at it. Hopefully they go back to the Ring/Cape style legendaries. Was more fun working on an item of power over the course of the expansion imo.</div></div><hr />

But it is being removed essentially if you don't want to partake. It's now a toggle for every server.<br />

It is very bad. For example, arcane power from a mage lasts 10 sec. -1.5 sec you have 8.5 sec left to cast your spells. That's ridiculous.<br />
When you have to activate three power boost abilities than you have to click 4,5 sec until you can start making damage. That's even more ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I think at Bli$$ard are working only morons...<br />
<br />
This example doesn't work for being a reason as to not have them on the GCD. If you hit all three boosts and they up your power by 33% lets say to boost your power to a total of 100% and you can get one cast off afterwards before the buff wears off you will do X amount of damage. Now lets say we do it your way and it is off the GCD. You hit all three at the same time but they only buff you 16.6% each so a total of 50% boost. You then are able to cast the same damage spell twice. You still only did the same X amount of damage as when it was on the GCD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I need to do is wait for all the content be released, play it for 2 months and beat everything released within the last year. Too much waiting for a basic and easy game. Lazy Blizzard, just lazy.</div></div><hr />

Nice diminutive there. PvP in this game just sucks I doubt anyone is afraid of it, and you don't have to take my opinion on that. There's a reason it's a niche part of the game and not a mainstay.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter that much how much damage you do in the end. The bad feeling matters. You click your first ability and the timer is running and you have ZERO benefit of it because you want to start your two other abilities. That's the most ridiculous about this stupid change. They always say they change things because something is not fun enough. I don't see how wasting time is more fun than clicking on a boost ability and immediately start casting your damage spells.<br />

<br />
Just in case you hadn't heard someone mention it--there's a title you can get in Legion for doing all the first aid quests to help npcs around the Broken Isles called 'Field Medic'. When the pre-patch hits, its gonna get removed, so you should complete it if you have the inclination--its account bound.<br />
<br />
The way to tell your progress is to go to your achieves/professions/first aid and itll show you a list of what quests you still have to do. If you go to group finder and type in 'field medic- zone name' there are lots of groups farming mobs round the clock for those drops. A couple of them drop in each zone, you see. You may even be close just by doing them casually throughout Legion. When I checked my main, she was 12/16. GL &lt;3<br />
