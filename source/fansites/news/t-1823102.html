Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - July 21<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
General<br />
<br />
Tier-18 2-piece set bonus for Protection Paladins' Avenger's Reprieve effect no longer stacks and will refresh the duration of the effect instead.<br />
Fixed an issue that caused Hammer of the Righteous to often hit the primary target twice instead of damaging one of the secondary targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br />
General<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where the damage increase in a hotfix from June 26 for Repudiation of War was not working correctly.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k))<br />
General<br />
<br />
Felhunter should now correctly require line-of-sight with its target to use the Spell Lock ability. Previously, it was incorrectly using line-of-sight with the Warlock instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Naval Missions<br />
<br />
Black Market Journal (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/missions/647-black-market-journal): This naval mission should now have the correct blockade prerequisite for Barrier Sea.<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
Filling the Ranks (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9129-filling-the-ranks): Tracking for progress towards completing the achievement should now be working correctly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
Two important notes about Mercenary mode: 1. You have to elect into it. 2. Mercenaries look and play 100% like the opposite faction. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621458723446243328))<br />
If someone wants nothing to do with mercenary mode, their experience will essentially be the same as it is now. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621459231753940993))<br />
I don't play human. But obvious question is what happens to them when they become orc but have no trink? Thx for all u guys do btw!<br />
We're discussing solutions to that problem. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621459916658573312))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Do you think WoW 7.0 will be released on consoles, too? WoD ability pruning feels like a preparation for game controllers.<br />
I would be surprised. WoW is really dependent on mouse + keyboard. But I have no insider knowledge either way. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614464873603338240))<br />
Seems like 80% of the mmoc crowd dislikes the WoD changes. http://t.co/aprDb9dkmZ<br />
I can't comment on specific changes because I'm out of touch. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614465834753196041))<br />
My experience has been that players often remember how they felt when the game was new. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614466047316373504))<br />
They remember that feeling and associate the older designs with those fond memories. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614466209120063488))<br />
I loved the experience I had in BWL. Does that make BWL a better raid than Ulduar or ToT? Not in my opinion. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614466372286836736))<br />
<br />
At lunch we were discussing progression rates in various games. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614546473607262208))<br />
I postulated you can never effectively increase game time by drawing things out. You always have to add new rewards to justify it. Thoughts? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614546692130484224))<br />
An example might be level rates in RPGs or farming loot in order to be able to handle bigger challenges. Just adding time always falls flat. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614546896447668224))<br />
drawing out the rewards will make probably a third of players say Ill never get there. I quit.<br />
Right. That was my thought. You can add more rewards to increase the time commitment though. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614547279454691328))<br />
depends on the &quot;experience&quot;. Are you trying to take a 20 hour experience and stretch it into a non meaningful 200hr exp?<br />
No, I think there are games that do a good job of offering both. But some people want the shorter version and just get overwhelmed. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614568323661983744))<br />
If it was a compelling enough game for me to want to play it again, I'd choose 200 on the second play thru.<br />
Yeah, exactly. The same way you might go do new game+ for a harder version (or move on to another game). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614568450912956416))<br />
only if the 20 hr experience cost less $$<br />
Interesting.... (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614568545498738688))<br />
I think that's better done through design. If you ask people whether they want to miss out on stuff, they'll choose not to.<br />
It's an issue of discipline. You can tell yourself to ignore all the collectibles on your map, but it's hard in actuality. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614568686142095361))<br />
I would prefer they just give me the 20 hour experience because dev resources still would have been drained to make the 200.<br />
I like the 200 hour experience in Witcher 3 and Assassin's Creed. I didn't want it for Batman. I think it's individual taste. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614569130658664448))<br />
Maybe 20hrs gives you the main story directly and no side quests while the 200 throws you into the world like Skyrim<br />
Yeah that's what I was thinking, or at least far fewer side quests. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614569222757167105))<br />
I had friends quit Witcher because they were overwhelmed rather than just try and focus on the core story. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614569326130020352))<br />
<br />
What if a game asked you at first launch if you wanted the 20 or the 200 hour experience? Sort of like choosing difficulty? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614567082198351872))<br />
You mean similar to how Bioware had that 'Dialogue heavy, combat light' option for Mass Effect 3, but for open world?<br />
Exactly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/614569682960433152))<br />

IIRC a carrier is one of the ship-type requirements for the last legendary mission, though it can be bypassed if you just toss ships at it until RNG favours you...<br />
<br />
What i would like to know (And is probably hard to collect bulk data about) is how many people just abandon the shipyard completely when they're done with the legendary missions. :3</div></div><hr />

I don't know if I just got lucky on my ships, but my ships very rarely get destroyed now that they are epic and I don't even bother swapping them out. Now that they are epic I just send them on oil or treasure missions (already have legendary quest complete). I lost like.... 6 ships maybe...</div></div><hr />

You need lvl 3 for the final legendary ship mission, unless they hotfixed it, but you have to complete all the legendary quests for the ring, one of which is the quest that requires 25 treasure missions and lvl 3 shipyard.</div></div><hr />

I can imagine a scenario where there are people logging in and doing their garrison stuff, and nothing else. which would make them active, thus showing up in this pool. (But then I am not entirely sure what constitutes &quot;active&quot;). There is certainly a segment of players who have given up on the expansion, but still recognize that the gold that the garrison generates will still be useful if they come back. They have no reason to unlock Tanaan and get themselves a level 1 ship yard.</div></div><hr />

Kept avoiding doing treasure missions if I couldn't make them 100% at first, but now, meh. I just put unsinkable on my ships and send them out. Beats constantly swapping out other addons. I just don't do missions below 75%.<br />
<br />
As for those without a level 3 shipyard despite finishing the quest, maybe they don't have the resources. My shaman, who's nearly done with the 25 treasure missions, dropped below 2500 resources so now I have to stockpile again to build the level 3 shipyard. Trying to hurry up and finish the quest could have resulted in them losing a lot of ships resulting in more ships having to be built and them then deciding to try to get as close to 100% as possible meaning buying the various addons constantly. Those things aren't cheap. Funny how Blizzard said they'd adjust the price if they found a lot of players swapping out parts, but I haven't seen hide nor hair of them doing so on the PTR. Makes me wonder if many players are either just not bothering or doing what I am (putting unsinkable on every ship). Makes me think if any price is changed, unsinkable will end up 1000-2000 resources instead. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I also find it funny that my druid finished the shipyard legendary quest chain first while I'm still waiting for it on my shaman. My druid also finished it first try with a 77% competition chance (with unsinkable on her ships). People who lose their ships and say it's really 50-50 exaggerate. No one talks about what percentage they succeed at but everyone talks about what they fail at. I had a mission succeed at 36% the other day and I was TRYING to destroy the ships. Didn't work. :p Funny how when I want to lose a ship, I can't unless I decommission it, but when I don't want to lose a ship, I lose 2!</div></div><hr />

It's just annoying until you get the level 3 shipyard to have to trot out there to do missions when logging into your alts, really. That and the whole having to rebuild them taking anywhere from 20-60 minutes when you just wanna log into your alts, spam Master Plan and log out to get to the next alt. It's just irritating. That, and the fact that once you get all your ships to epic, half the time the only missions you CAN do are just for worthless XP or yet another BOA Baleful token. <br />
<br />
They're just the same thing as garrison missions with more risk and less reward. I probably won't bother once I get all the rare rewards out of it (all BOA rings and Left Shark) save for the occasional gold/apexis mission when they pop.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also the factthat 29% of people have completed 25 treasure missions yet only 11% have the upgraded level 3 shipyard shows just how badly designed this system is. The 25 treasure missions required for lvl3 should really be checking the achievement for those of us who accidentally started doing treasure missions before getting that quest. My other level 100 alt is basically hoarding the treasure missions right now until I upgrade to level 2, then I'm going to do all 6 of them sitting on my map at once.</div></div><hr />

You say more than once in this single post that you essentially think the shipyard is a bad addition to the game, but you don't understand people who stop doing it? There are already so many things in WoW that people do solely for the rewards, so adding yet another one that a) is a terrible feature, b) is poorly implemented, c) has a very poor reward/time ratio and d) doesn't even make sense from a story perspective seems really ridiculous. Like so many other players, I'm doing shipyard missions ONLY to finish the legendary stuff because I feel obligated to in order to help my raiding team. Otherwise I wouldn't even touch the stupid thing. It's not the least bit fun or interesting and it's painfully obvious there wasn't much thought put into the design of it.</div></div><hr />

No you don't. I had the legendary quest from the shipyard completed with only 20 treasure missions done. I only got the final mission to 88% as I didn't have Carriers unlocked yet.<br />

You can also just get the arrakoa ship from OotA exalted, which is a destroyer that can act as a carrier also. It doesn't require a level 3 shipyard, and you can buy it outright for 180G and thus avoid the build time, it starts as a green ship though so you still have to level it sadly.</div></div><hr />

There are already so many things in WoW that people do solely for the rewards, so adding yet another one that a) is a terrible feature, b) is poorly implemented, c) has a very poor reward/time ratio and d) doesn't even make sense from a story perspective seems really ridiculous. Like so many other players, I'm doing shipyard missions ONLY to finish the legendary stuff because I feel obligated to in order to help my raiding team. Otherwise I wouldn't even touch the stupid thing. It's not the least bit fun or interesting and it's painfully obvious there wasn't much thought put into the design of it.<br />
<br />
Yeah, and I explained my perspective. The rewards aren't stellar, but for the time investment (which is relatively low) they're solid. That doesn't mean the Shipyard is a good feature, it just means that the cost/benefit analysis makes it worth doing anyway.</div></div><hr />

What i would like to know (And is probably hard to collect bulk data about) is how many people just abandon the shipyard completely when they're done with the legendary missions. :3<br />

You can count 14 people from my raid group in the &quot;done with ship yard&quot;.</div></div><hr />

But yeah, the shipyard is meh to me. I don't hate it, but I don't like it, either. I have only bothered to do about 1 naval mission a day after I received my sea chart for the legendary quest.<br />

The 25 treasure missions required for lvl3 should really be checking the achievement for those of us who accidentally started doing treasure missions before getting that quest. My other level 100 alt is basically hoarding the treasure missions right now until I upgrade to level 2, then I'm going to do all 6 of them sitting on my map at once.<br />
You mixed up the graph. Only 12.2% of people have completed 25 treasure missions. The 29% is for 50 naval missions. So that's only 0.4% of people who don't have lvl 3 shipyard even though they've completed the requirements.<br />

Yeah, I figure that's most of them. I managed to have enough resources until I upgraded to 3 - then after I was pretty much out of them.</div></div><hr />

The loot is SO great...I now have seven pairs of account bound baleful plate boots! <br />
<br />
In all seriousness though, it's really obvious that the shipyard was tossed together quickly in order to add another time gate to the legendary quest. <br />
<br />
If you aren't doing the Legendary quest there are absolutely zero shipyard missions worth running once you reach level 3 unless you want baleful gear for alts. Other than that it's nothing but the occasional 125 gold or 10 Sorcerous Water. <br />
<br />
Even the cheapest, most poorly designed Facebook or Phone game would be designed to keep you playing for longer than this. Honestly, the shipyard is just an embarassment and Blizzard should be ashamed to call it content.</div></div><hr />

No thanks Blizz, I have enough facebook games already to do in my garrison. You don't have to play if you don't want to I hear some say? I'm waiting around for flying and I've paid for it, might as well play. Just not shipyards.</div></div><hr />

I have all at epic, but transport never counted. Since the shipyard is largely irrelevant, I have almost zero interest in leveling another transport to epic.<br />
<br />
Did this only apply to EU?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I hit this bug and reported it and was told all would be fine when I levelled another Transport... ie they couldn't fix it.<br />
<br />
Hence I have had to decommission my perfectly good epic Transport so I can level another from scratch for the achievement. On top of the Murloch destroyer that fulfils the same role but likely won't count as it's a destroyer...<br />
<br />
In general though I have decommissioned far more ships than I have lost - not sure I've even lost one on my main yet: a mixture of picking the right missions, good balance of ships, splashing out on the module for them and an amount of luck.<br />

Shipyard command board is in the garrison from the start. I don't mind keeping the shipwright down by the water.<br />
Move the guy that sells ship parts next to the shipwright or in the garrison.<br />
Ship missions use fewer oil resources. Having to do the daily every day to keep up with missions and ships between destroyed is a chore.<br />

It would also be cool if we could trade garrison resources for oil at the trading post.</div></div><hr />

Did a 94% treasure mission and subsequently failed it and lost both of my epic ships. Considering it takes a few days to level another ship to epic (if you don't lose the ship while leveling it), its a giant waste of time and still requires a lot of garrison resources if you want to 100% every mission. I've also had a ship with the unsinkable trait be sunk, its ridiculous. It would be better if we could purchase the ship traits with oil instead of garrison resources.</div></div><hr />

The chart is reversed and is presumably correct.<br />

Not all active players are at a point where they can get the Shipyard, as mind-blowing as that sounds.<br />

I've got 4 characters, 2 at Shipyard rank 3, and 2 at Level 2. All 4 have max epic ships in all slots. <br />

<br />
With the anticipated upcoming content drought those numbers may improve somewhat but only because there is, or will be, essentially nothing else to do in the game.<br />

The Level 3 shipyard is required to unlock the Carrier, so you can't have an epic version of all of the ships without it.</div></div><hr />
