Thottbot is currently updating their item tooltips to add % infos for each rating, it's nice but it's messing OUR tooltips a bit, so if you see a few funky colors on your item bonuses, we're aware of the problem and it should be fixed ... soon. <br />

IRC<br />
For those of you who are interested, I also created #mmo-champion on irc.quakenet.org. I will personally hug the first 20 people who will join.</div></div><hr />
