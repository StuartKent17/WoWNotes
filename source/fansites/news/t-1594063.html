Patch 6.0.2 PTR Notes - Sep 18 Update<br />
It looks like the current Brawler's Guild season will end with Patch 6.0.2, so be sure to get any achievements before they become Legacy achievements (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements?filter-search=Pandaria+campaign). <br />
World Environment<br />
Creatures<br />
<br />
Access to Ordon Sanctuary or eligibility for loot from Ordos no longer requires players to have completed the Legendary Cloak questline.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Legendary Cloak Quest Line<br />
<br />
As part of the transition from Mists of Pandaria to Warlords of Draenor, players who are not already on the Legendary Cloak quest line will no longer be able to begin it.<br />
Players that are already on the Legendary Cloak quest line have until November 13 to complete Wrathion's tasks and challenges. Once Warlords of Draenor launches, the Legendary Cloak quest line will be gone entirely—the quests and the cloak will no longer be obtainable, and any related in-progress quests will be cleared from the quest log.<br />
Characters will continue to be able to repurchase rewards they've already obtained (such as the epic cloak and Legendary metagem) from the quest line.<br />
A Test of Valor has been removed. Players on Wrathion’s Legendary quest line will now skip ahead to the next step.<br />
Full details of the changes can be found in the blog titled: Legendary Cloak Quest Last Chance – Black Prince Buff Extended (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/15910699/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar<br />
<br />
Garrosh Hellscream<br />
<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar achievements will be relabeled according to the new difficulty structure (e.g. “Heroic: Malkorok” will now be “Mythic: Malkorok”). Credit for these achievements will be retroactively awarded to players who earned them prior to Patch 6.0.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds and Arenas<br />
<br />
PvP Season 15 comes to an end with the launch of Patch 6.0.2. (Date has not been determined yet.)<br />
<br />
Conquest Points will be converted into Honor Points, and any Honor above the cap of 4,000 will be converted into in-game currency at a rate of 35 silver per point.<br />
Season 15 items will have Conquest costs converted into Honor Points equivalent to their previous Conquest Point cost, with the exception of any items that have a rating requirement.<br />
Season 15 items with rating requirements will no longer be available for purchase.<br />
Note that Arena and Rated Battleground matches will not be available until PvP Season 16 begins.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Vendors who sell PvE Heirloom items for Justice Points have taken a vacation. PvE Heirlooms will continue to be available at the Darkmoon Faire and Trial of the Crusader, and PvP Heirlooms will still be able to be purchased for Honor.<br />
<br />
Shield and off-hand Heirloom items will be added to PvE Heirloom vendors at the Darkmoon Faire.<br />
Discussion for this topic can be found in the forum thread titled: Heirloom Vendor Change in Patch 6.0.2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brawler's Guild<br />
<br />
Season 1 of the Brawler's has come to a close and associated achievements have been converted into Feats of Strength.<br />
Fights will be unavailable while the Brawler's Guild is being refitted in preparation for Season 2 (available after Warlords of Draenor has launched.)<br />
Account-wide membership in Brawler's Guild will carry over to Season 2. Once a brawler, always a brawler!<br />
<br />
<br />
Mount Journal<br />
<br />
Grand Expedition Yak’s reforge vendor (Mystic Birdhat) has been replaced with a vendor that offers transmogrification services.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Raid and Challenge Mode Testing<br />
FEEDBACK: Challenge Modes<br />
Starting with this beta build, all Challenge Mode dungeons are accessible. You can access them either by zoning in manually, or by setting difficulty to Challenge and speaking with Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade (in major cities or your garrison).<br />
<br />
Tuning is definitely a work in progress. Some things are brutally hard, bordering on impossible. Some of the mob kill counts are off, and we'd like to hear about that - if you fall short of the kill count without using Invis/Shroud to skip any packs, or if you're completing the kill requirement well before the end of the dungeon, let us know. And of course, Gold/Silver/Bronze times are very much placeholder.<br />
<br />
Please use this thread for any feedback and reports of issues you encounter. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/339915-feedback-challenge-modes/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14505830447?page=1#1))<br />
<br />
Raid Testing Schedule - September 19<br />
On Friday, September 19, we will continue Warlords Mythic raid testing. As always given the nature of beta, it is quite possible that there will be technical or gameplay issues that disrupt the testing. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.<br />
<br />
Mythic difficulty is designed for a fixed-size 20-player group.<br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below on all Beta servers.<br />
<br />
Friday, September 19<br />
<br />
Beastlord Darmac - Mythic Foundry<br />
10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
Iron Maidens - Mythic Foundry<br />
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 24:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, fire, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.

<br />
No an issue there. Do like I did with MoP, D3, and RoS: Ask them in the support ticket to convert the digital copy's cost to game time. It works out to being like 80 days. Is exactly how I plan to handle it this release too.</div></div><hr />

So some kind of exchange of goods or money is definitely involved. Not to mention the most avid WoW players among your friends will already have preordered - those that want the CE don't want a digital CE after the actual release of WoD.<br />
<br />
Nope, this is going to cause Ebay etc. get overloaded with people trying to pawn off their reclaimed digital CE keys, for of course way less than it would cost on the Battle.net Store, considering cheaper online stores such as G2A - people looking for a bargain won't pick up something from Ebay that's only 5-10 bucks cheaper than on the official store, when there are even cheaper options.<br />
<br />
Can't we just get game time, like they did if you got the D3 CE after already getting D3 via the Annual Pass? At least that'd be a fixed value. You could still buy your friend a digital CE from the money you don't have to spend on the subscription, if you wanted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I'm reading. It's really quite funny. Blizzard is trying to sell you two copies and gift one to a friend later. Kinda reminds me of the annual pass awhile back except far far worse. When signing up for the annual pass you got D3 for free, but if you wanted the CE of D3 and bought that you got a few months free of WoW to compensate for the extra cost. That made sense. But this, this is just too funny. &quot;Pay twice, give one to friend, we get more subs.&quot; All the while making it read like a big promotion. lol</div></div><hr />

Funny that they're advertising it as if it's a special deal, and not just buying an extra copy for a friend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering that you are paying $50 extra for getting both instead of just CE. You should get 3 1/2 months.<br />
<br />
But, yea, a time extension would be better than an extra copy.<br />
<br />
On the plus side if your willing to wait a week or so after WoD comes out, you might be able to pick up a cheaper copy from those that took advantage of this and wanted to resell it.</div></div><hr />

Would people really be so dumb to buy the game twice just because of &quot;OMG BOOST MUST HAVE NAO!!&quot; ?<br />
Seriously you can 90 a char in a week for free.<br />

<br />
Wrong. It's more like buy two, and hand the extra one you bought to a friend.</div></div><hr />

Which in itself assumes two significant points:<br />
<br />
<br />
That you have friends who are playing WoW or are interested in playing Wow.<br />
Friends that haven't already ordered WoD.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It would quite simply have been better to do what they did for those who bought the CE for Diablo III and had already been in the Annual Pass -- extra playing time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been doing this, in essence, since MoP's release, and will continue to going forward. If you ask for game time in the support ticket, they will give you equal value in that. It's been 80 days pretty much, per release that I have done this for. I had asked for Blizzard Wallet funds with Reaper of Souls, figured could use it for Hearthstone, or eventually Heroes of the Storm, but they cannot do that. But WoW game time, sure can!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They might. Are you still paying a sub fee for live and also going on nearly 13 months of no new content to live?<br />
<br />
If you are, blizzard probably thinks you're stupid enough to fall for this scheme.</div></div><hr />

Nope I have been unsubbed for a while now, I'm coming back for WoD but this just makes me skeptical about giving them anymore of my money.</div></div><hr />

Step 6) Eat pie.<br />

The bloody game doesn't become available till then no matter what, so what's it matter if I have the art book and such a week early.</div></div><hr />

At least they look pretty on my shelf.</div></div><hr />

:) You understand how it works - many people in this thread think it's some kind of desperate scam (despite the fact they've been doing this for the last few expansions and Diablo III even)<br />
<br />
This is not something new, this is simply them advertising the fact that they do this - many people want to start playing the minute the expansion launches - but many people for whatever reason cannot get the box copy of the CE they ordered for a day or two after release - buying the normal digital allows them to play immediately, but still turn it in for an unused code when they do finally get their CE :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you all really getting this angry? If you don't have a friend to sell the key to, don't do it. If he wants the key, he was likely to buy WoD anyway, in which case Blizzard don't make any more money than they would have normally, it's just all from you, not split accross you AND your friend. I<br />
<br />
t's not shady, or a scam or anything else, it says right there what they're doing and what you're doing, if you don't want to do it, don't. If you think this is a &quot;scam&quot; or &quot;shady&quot;, you're an idiot, because you don't know what either of those words mean in this context.<br />

<br />
I have been torn about buying the CE at launch or buying a DE now. I have most of the CE already and I love them, I like the physical stuff - I thought when reading this.. perfect, I can pre order my CE for delivery, buy the SE now and start playing as soon as its live on the servers even if the delivery doesnt arrive in time. They can refund my SE onto my blizzard account and I can buy the space goat or something.<br />
<br />
What a letdown. All my freinds that would want this key would already have bought it. and I am not going to give it to a random friend cause I cant even use it for a RaF.<br />
<br />
Nice idea, but I think this will only be used my a very very small percentage of players</div></div><hr />

<br />
First they announce what will happen with part of game content such is legendary item (making it non obtainable). Then giving (SHUT UP) type of answer to justly angered, disappointed and frustrated players. And then on last third round simply hammering down communication through 5 pinned lines proving how previous answer was in fact (SHUT UP) type of answer and through it the very communication ....<br />
<br />
Now, why in first place they even bother with communication about something like this since their attitude at least on this matter is &quot;say what you wish, will make jack shit difference on this matter&quot; ?</div></div><hr />
