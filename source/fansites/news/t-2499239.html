Patch 8.2 Hotfixes - July 25th, 2019<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Azshara’s Eternal Palace<br />

Fixed an issue that could cause players to charge under the world while swimming in the Eternal Palace.<br />
The door to Za'qul no longer opens until nearby enemies have been defeated.<br />
The Queen’s Court<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug where sometimes Frenetic Charge (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/300550-frenetic-charge) would not damage targets in certain situations in all difficulties.<br />
<br />
Queen Azshara<br />
<br />
Cyranus should no longer throw his Charged Spear (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/298425-charged-spear) if he is defeated just before throwing it.<br />
Changed the magic school of Charged Spear (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/298425-charged-spear) from Arcane to Nature for all difficulties.<br />
Reduced the duration of Arcane Vulnerability (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/302999-arcane-vulnerability) to 5 seconds (was 7 seconds) on Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic Keystone Dungeons<br />
<br />
Beguiling Emissaries are no longer affected by Sanguine (https://www.wowdb.com/affixes/8-sanguine).<br />
Void Touched Emissaries are now immune to Distract (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/1725-distract).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that caused Relinquished Azerite Spaulders (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169337-relinquished-azerite-spaulders) tokens to not generate Mantle of Ceremonial Ascension (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158344-mantle-of-ceremonial-ascension) or Mantle of Fastidious Machinations (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158304-mantle-of-fastidious-machinations).<br />
Fixed a bug which could cause Logic Loop of Synergy (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169156-logic-loop-of-synergy) to not trigger on several healing spells such as Atonement (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/81749-atonement) or Prayer of Mending (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/33076-prayer-of-mending).<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
Arcane Heart (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/303006-arcane-heart)<br />
<br />
There is now a confirmation prompt when a Rank 3 Anima of Life and Death (Essence) is created, as a check to confirm you’re in the intended Loot Specialization. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Harbinger's Inscrutable Will (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167867-harbingers-inscrutable-will) now deals 50% damage against player targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where the Mechagon Reclamation Rig sometimes did not reset where it was previously completed.<br />
<br />
<br />
World Quests<br />
<br />
Bloodlust and other similar effects should no longer move runes offscreen during &quot;Runelocked Chest (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/56022-runelocked-chest)&quot;.<br />
&quot;Vicemaul (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/51508-vicemaul)&quot; can now be completed while the world quest &quot;Naga Attack! (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53773-naga-attack)&quot; is active in the Timbered Strand in Drustvar.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Here’s hoping Limit pulls off a world class kill and shocks the raiding scene. This method gets there dream of being dethroned</div></div><hr />

Did you just start playing yesterday? Players have been soloing since Vanilla (i.e. Paladins in Scarlet Monastery dungeons at 30-40). Mione and others have done it for years.</div></div><hr />

Of cos its been present to various degrees in WoW but the amount of soloing instance and also raid bosses in current content is mongoloid.<br />
<br />
But it's what happens when some specs got defensive, healing and offense capabilities rolled into the same build.</div></div><hr />

Hahaha that is the typical Blizzard move: &quot;Hey, players are skipping our awful trash, let's force them to do it!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Like the toolkit paladins have always had? Which is the same class Rextroy is playing there. I'd love to see you do the same.</div></div><hr />

True, basically WE are the robots. Defensive, healing and DPS is what any robot would be capable of. xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I've been trying to find a group willing to take me (405 destro lock) on a normal, non-keystone Mechagon run all week without luck. Even trying to start my own groups, just sitting there in the premade finder at 1/5 for hours on end.<br />
<br />
And some people can solo it.<br />
<br />
Its... frustrating.</div></div><hr />
