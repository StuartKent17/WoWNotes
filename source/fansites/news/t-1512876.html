<br />
and lol @ the person saying FF14 is the best game on the market. Yeah, it only took them a decade of screwing up FF11 and then years of screwing up FF14 to turn it into a functional product. Good job, Square-Enix! Bright future ahead there, for sure.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chickat</div><div class="date">2014-05-06, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mop lost a lot of people early game, but has done wonders at subscriber retention. The last we heard during cata, wow was at 9.1m subs. That was from the previous quarter, so its likely they were in the low 8m. I mean in a years time MoP has only lost wow 100k subs. Pretty impressive if you ask me for a 10 year old game. I expect subs to fall to just under 7m and then rise back up to 8.5-9m with WoD. WoW aint dead yet.</div></div><hr />

I'll never understand these types of comments. What made you decide to post this, what are you hoping to get out of it? And if Wow is dying with 7.6 million subs I'm sure a lot of mmo's would like to be 'dying' right now.</div></div><hr />

I tend to agree. WoW probably has around 3-4m loyal western players, and 1-2m loyal eastern players. I don't expect subs to fall below 4m any time in the next 6 or 7 years. I figure wow has 10 more years before ftp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say that definitely played a part in it. I think that also, what really played a large role in this 'minimal' sub loss is the fact that so many people expected WoD to drop a lot sooner than it is going to. This caused many people to either re-sub or pre-pay more time to their accounts. This would also give a boost to their number of subscribers.<br />
<br />
I would like to see an actual graph showing how many are pre-paid time, active sub, in-active subs with time remaining, etc....</div></div><hr />

<br />
A bigger dip in Q2 perhaps, but that can be ridden out on our glorious march to expansion.<br />
<br />
next quarter will be about the same. Remember, the snapshot will be taken on June 30th, which means beta will be in full swing and 6.0 will be right around the corner. Players come back for the .0 patch before the actual expansion.<br />
<br />
Also, people need to remember that ´we´ are not the average player. Because of the availability of Flex, the average player is now making progress into the real SoO. I am the GM of one of those 1k ´everyone´ guilds and we still have groups of players killing different aspects of SoO flex every week. People on the forums are hardcore, and don´t realize how huge of a difference Flex makes to giving normal players content at the end of an expansion... it is a bit difference to the 10 months without content we saw in Cata.</div></div><hr />

Hes saying overall in the last year they lost 100k, if you look at this time last year it was 7.7 million, and now it is 7.6 million that is a 100k loss over a year. <br />

I think it is.<br />
- First because we are coming back to 2007 levels.<br />
- Second because the overall population grew quite a bit and the gaming population exploded with smartphones and tablets during this time of decrease for Wow.<br />
- And third, I may be wrong but I'm quite sure the number of people quitting the game, hopefully temporarily, will begin to explode as people are fed up with SoO. If my guild and even the connected realms I am in are any guide, it could be a bloodbath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard made more profit by selling a vanity pet in their store and giving half the money to charity than The Secret World made last year.<br />
<br />
Blizzard sold twice as many pre-orders of WoD, almost 10 months in advance to it´s release, than EVE has subscribers, which is the only really other successful subscriber based game out there.<br />
<br />
And something nobody has mentioned. Despite the fact that WOW is in the worst time of it´s cycle, the end of of an expansion... it saw the release of a major competitor without any major loss of subscribers. Another wow-killer come and gone, and Blizzard continues to beat earnings estimates.<br />

<br />
Blizzard sold twice as many pre-orders of WoD, almost 10 months in advance to it´s release, than EVE has subscribers, which is the only really other successful subscriber based game out there.<br />
<br />
And something nobody has mentioned. Despite the fact that WOW is in the worst time of it´s cycle, the end of of an expansion... it saw the release of a major competitor without any major loss of subscribers. Another wow-killer come and gone, and Blizzard continues to beat earnings estimates.<br />
<br />
Tomorrow is going to be a good day.<br />
<br />
You forgot the /drops microphone.<br />
<br />
Well said. Additionally, it's hilarious to me that these boards are filled with kids that stopped playing WOW and still can't let go of the game and hang around here trying to justify not re subbing by making disparaging remarks about the game. Quite sad really. Move on and just let us play the game we love.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So your slam on Blizzard is that they ´only´ kept subscribers by selling them $60 character boosts?<br />
<br />
you sir, fail at business if you think that is a bad thing. Players are willingly paying $50 or $60, 10 months before a new expansion, and pay a subscription fee to keep playing the game... and you think that shows WOW is bad?? yes yes.. WOW can ONLY keep subscribers by charging them an extra $60... the game is obviously dying.</div></div><hr />

Well, maybe. My buddy gave me a card with a year of game time - I won't be billed again until next April, so there's really no way for me to &quot;quit&quot; right now. But I haven't preordered. I'm sure I will. I'll most likely play WoD, I've been playing since open beta. But I'll still hate the lack of flying, still suspect that everybody who prefers the lack of flying is a jerk, and still be unable to fathom why, after riding in something that can FLY, anybody would want to forsake that. <br />

There are costs associated with running that many servers, and when subscribers go down, the variable costs do not immediately move with them. They might not necessarily be losing money each time this happens (in fact I rather doubt it), but it is certainly less profitable. A fairly consistent decline in subscribers is not something investors want to see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if you quit out of protest against no flying in WoD during the last 3 months, you would still count as a &quot;subscriber&quot; because you were an active subscriber at least once during those 3 months.<br />
<br />
Q2 (and if the WoD release is really late, Q3) quarter call will probably show bigger losses, though the sub numbers seem surprisingly stable to me.</div></div><hr />

BUT.. noone enjoys expansion's last patches that stay for a year. We were used to that in the old days when it took you alot more to see and experience all of the content and it kept you busy.<br />
Everything evolves so fast these days and we get bored much faster because we're spoiled of constant updates and patches. <br />
It's obvious that 200k was majorly because of the WoD pre-order boost. Next 2 quarters together will have 1mil drop or probably more than that. <br />
Also noone will even smell Garrosh anymore since they made if official that he'll drop guaranteed looms come 6.0. No sane person would farm looms till then.<br />
With all the people they pulled from &quot;Titan&quot; team i really believed they'd throw content out quicker but obviously that didn't happen.<br />
I just hope that WoD will give us what we deserve for all the wait.<br />

<br />
Really, Blizzard seriously needs to wake up - there should never be a case where there is one patch which lasts for a frikkin' year and 5.4 will last exactly that if not more. Seriously, even half a year is too much, they should release new major content every 4-5 months if they want to stabilize the subs.</div></div><hr />

I think that also, what really played a large role in this 'minimal' sub loss is the fact that so many people expected WoD to drop a lot sooner than it is going to. This caused many people to either re-sub or pre-pay more time to their accounts. This would also give a boost to their number of subscribers.<br />
<br />
I would like to see an actual graph showing how many are pre-paid time, active sub, in-active subs with time remaining, etc....<br />

No you won't. That number is the number they ended the quarter with. It's pretty clear in the verbage.<br />
<br />
In response to the guy you responded to, I quit and it had nothing to do with the loss of flying. Personally, I prefer them getting rid of flying. Stop banging that stupid drum and maybe the other group of people saying they'll quit if there's no flying will stop banging theirs. It's a dumb argument. Lack of flying isn't going to make or break WoW at this point.<br />
<br />
OT : This is the most stable that the subscriber rate has been in a long time. Could be they've hit their current plateau for the foreseeable future. The expansion will obviously bring people back, but I think that ~7.5 million is a reasonably safe number for subscribers for the next year or so.</div></div><hr />

Finding it hard to believe it myself, but I guess its true then. I expected a few more losses tbh. 7.6m is still pretty good. But alpha hasnt even started, let alone beta lol, the expansion is far away, just shows how Blizzard is the puppet-master and people keep dancing on the strings and giving them more money. Yet here you are with 6+ more months of SoO. Expansion cost of WoD is also around 10 frogs more expensive. You pay more, you recieve less. :)<br />
<br />
And with a multi-million company such as Blizzard you'd expect them to push out a little bit more content. There are F2P pushing out more.<br />
<br />
Oh well. Keep paying people.</div></div><hr />

WoD may well boost subs to 9 million or even 10 million, seriously who knows. There is no end in sight! <br />
<br />
Whatever Blizzard are doing, they are still doing it right to continue holding onto such a staggeringly large subscriber base. From a &quot;health&quot; standpoint, the difference between 12 million subs and 7.5 million subs will never be noticed by the actual players. The game will still feel as alive as ever (depending on server/faction of course) as it was during TBC and WotLK.<br />
<br />
I personally quit WoW during Cata, haven't looked back since I picked up GW2, a much more casual-friendly MMO that looks gorgeous and plays well. But depending on how Blizzard handle the huge changes planned for WoD, I will probably come back!</div></div><hr />

A) Sub numbers being fairly stable for over a year says you're wrong<br />
B) So if you're not paying, nor playing, WoW anymore shouldn't you instead be only in FF forums<br />

<br />
But seriously, this is the period in time where there's no activity going on in wow content-wise so it's to be expected. WoW playerbase fluctuates, due to new games coming out when there is a lack of WoW content. it's practically become a seasonal time period for MMOs now. And even then, WoW isn't even close to dying. All the subs it's gradually losing are the fluff subs from WoTLK during 2010-2011 which is quite evident. It was a huge spike and we haven't fallen too far away from it yet as the graph shows. Any claim that Wow is somehow dying for the umpteenth time is ridiculous. Not calling any shots atm, but people need to realize that subs wont just drop to 0, it's simply descending back to it's core playerbase. The fact it's starting to plateau in the 7 millions is already evident of that (7 mil is outstanding for a core playerbase btw, let alone a playerbase in general). No game can keep 12 million subs forever, the fact that WoW even hit that mark is quite a feat in MMO history, so dont frown that it's over, but smile that it happened.</div></div><hr />

The boost to 90. There's your PVE content.<br />
I believe it acted in a way to prevent sub bleeding much like the Annual pass. <br />
I bet most people who preordered WoD are playing right now with their new boosted class(es). Hence, they have an active sub.<br />

And to everyone trying to twist this into &quot;Sure, 7.6 million but I bet they're all AFK!&quot; or some shit...seriously? Get a grip, move on. WoW isn't going anywhere and as much as it may anger you, others DO enjoy the game. Tough luck, your opinions aren't shared by everyone else. QQ more.<br />
<br />
/playing on 2 servers, both as packed now as ever.</div></div><hr />

It's easily outweighed by the sheer popularity of Hearthstone (And Crendor buying so many damn card packs) and the release of RoS.<br />
<br />
Lmao, Crendor probably stands for 50% of HS cards sold. Can't say I don't envy his collection. &lt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Good for Blizzard though! I'm one of those 200K who did unsub this quarter (again - after resubbing in Nov ;P) but I'll be back...eventually...whenever WoD decides to release :D</div></div><hr />

Yeah I've heard that before.<br />
<br />
I would say ~500k Q1 and ~1m Q2.<br />

You'd have to be a special kind of pessimist (or optimist, if wow losing subscribers is your goal) to think that WoD's release won't spike numbers upwards, and that'll be reported on the Q3 or Q4 report this year depending on how early into fall they manage to get the release out. Beta and 6.0 will probably keep numbers relatively stable through the end of Q2, if they're smart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly this. Every single MMO that has come out has had a worse combat system compared to WoW. The only one I found was more fun was the new Neverwinter, but every other aspect of that game sucked ass, so it crashed and burned too.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I feel like Dragon's Prophet and ESO has a better combat system than WoW. Less buttons, more movement based, and CC is mandatory for the singleplayer experience. Also in the later levels, they get tough as hell.</div></div><hr />

Definitely not ESO. The lack of buttons actually makes it boring. 6 skills is hilariously lame and makes combat super generic.</div></div><hr />

I think wildstar combat is way more fun.</div></div><hr />

If you PvP you hardly need new &quot;content&quot;. Instead every new expansion is a kind of nightmare to relearn those constantly changing talents and skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More like 10. Unless you don't basic attack, charge attack, block, or roll to dodge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draxz</div><div class="date">2014-05-06, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Will continue to drop until the next expansion hits, as always<br />
<br />
This shouldn't be considered shocking or even surprising, this pattern is repeated every time near the end of the current expansion and content gap<br />
<br />
Not sure if you see the graph.. we don't drop this signifigantly between xpacs and a very steady overall decline. Wow needs to change its policies and content releases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know I have been playing WOW since 2006 and ever since 2007 there were 2 to 3 new MMO's each year that would take WOW &quot;down&quot;.<br />
<br />
After having waded through dozens of these failures (with great names like Warhammer, Conan, Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Star Wars and other Tabula Rasa and Rifts), I no longer even look up when yet again a &quot;new&quot; one is announced.<br />
<br />
I think most people who have seen it all over these last 8 years and have the exact same feeling: if you want to play an MMORPG play the one everyone else played or play.<br />
<br />
That's why games like Hearthstone and the upcoming Heroes of the Storm have such a great attraction to return to play WOW now and then.<br />
<br />
I couldn't care less about a &quot;quest&quot; in one of those other games as I know by experience no one I know will play them 6 months down the line.<br />
<br />
As a break you need to play complete other genres, instead of milking the MMO line endlessly with extreme time fillers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Combining the worst parts of Cataclysm &amp; BC, Mythic Mode, 3rd mandatory raid FUUUUUUN stats, and some really stupid class/spell changes are much worse than no flying, but that's just me (it's still stupid that they're removing flight mounts because people are too dumb to explore the game world &amp; use flying mounts at the same time).</div></div><hr />
