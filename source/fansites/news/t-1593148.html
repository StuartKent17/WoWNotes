With the availability of the updated character models and animations that are being added with Warlords of Draenor, we’ve seen a question pop up among the community: “Will I be able to customize my face?” The simple answer is “yes.”<br />
<br />
We’re pleased to announce that the in-game Barber Shop will be able to provide additional facial-customization options for your character once these art updates are made available. For just a little gold, your character will be ready for any occasion and look their very best for any screenshot.</div></div><hr />

There will actually be an aftermarket for the codes given to physical ticket holders, should be a lot cheaper this year (or maybe there's someone you know with an extra code). But yeah I'm with you, wasn't planning on paying 40 bucks this year, so this code thing will work for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well when the new models go live, your characters face technically is going to change to something you might not like. I believe this is Blizzard's way of saying sorry, if you don't like your new face. Since you have no control over what face you're actually getting.</div></div><hr />

Blizz, if you're reading this... please, please, PLEASE can we have a murloc that isn't wearing a costume someday? I love the look of a plain ol' murloc. The skins, armor, weapons, wigs, hats, helmets, etc following the xpac theme are fun and traditional, but I'd be so much more happy with just a plain, nekkid murloc. Put one in the store if you want to make zillions. I'd pay half a zillion for a plain, purple, green, or color-changing nekkid murloc.</div></div><hr />

For me, pets are much, much more desirable. I am an avid collector and the only thing that's better than a Murloc pet are more Murloc pets :p<br />

I'm not even sure yet if I will be able to watch the stream, but I am definitely buying the virtual ticket. If only for the Murloc.</div></div><hr />

Most people buy it for the in game goodies. Always been. <br />
As for bad sound, you could turn on subs</div></div><hr />

You must not blizzcon often. Those &quot;Sounds from whoever else was using that building&quot;? It was all the same thing - Starcraft, Tournaments, etc. Be it through Virtual or Live, you would have heard that regardless. They sometimes have various segments running at the same time, in different halls. So while you have a WoW Q&amp;A running in Hall A, you may have a Starcraft II Tournament going on over in Hall B.</div></div><hr />
