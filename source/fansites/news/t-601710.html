Voice Chat on PTR<br />
This mean two things, 2.2 Patch should be live within 2 or 3 weeks with enough luck. This also means that they're considering cross-server battleground voice chat. (Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've never read about it before, but I'm often wrong) <br />
<br />
New testing servers, more room for testing, hurray. (And more ganking in Ghostlands, obviously)<br />
<br />
We will be activating Voice chat on the PTR with the new build tomorrow morning August 10th.<br />
<br />
Voice chat is currently available only for parties, raids and custom channels; there is no cross-server battleground voice chat at this time.<br />
<br />
Please be aware, that this is a brand new feature and although it has been tested by Blizzard QA there are still many outstanding issues and we expect to find many more as we roll it out to a larger test group. Please be diligent in reporting bugs either via this forum or the in-game feedback tool, and be patient with us while we work out the kinks in this new system.<br />
<br />
In order to facilitate additional testing, a second PVP server has been brought online, and the server population limits have been increased to lessen queues.</div></div><hr />

Why?<br />
<br />
<br />
I personally haven't seen it yet, but I doubt the quality of this voice chat will be anything good, which means static and lots of stupidity with mic compatibility..<br />
<br />
Blizzard has never made a voice chat before on any game, they have no experience with it, I'd rather pay the money per month for a Vent server (or a free TS) and get voice chatting software from the people who make voice chatting software and have experience in that field.</div></div><hr />

You know I don't wanna argue with you mate, but I have 100% faith in what Blizz is doing as a 'new' concept in their games. Everything that is old and is being increased in size has problems due to player base opinion. But nothing 'new' has ever had a bad start. :]</div></div><hr />

With a vague understanding of the way Blizzard work, the Voice Chat will be<br />
<br />
1. As good as anything out there at the moment, and not released until it is.<br />
2. Simply a way of giving complete noobs a better chance to complete instances and start raiding, and only as good as it needs to be for that purpose.<br />
<br />
By complete noobs I only refer to those clowns that simply refuse to read chat or follow any sort of instruction making PUG's a pure nightmare.<br />
<br />
I'd still prefer it to vent. That damn software resets my mic volume everytime I do anything with it. Drives me crazy!</div></div><hr />

Shadow: You can be fishy yourself! ;) (Joke inteded here, and probably a bad one).<br />
<br />
I hope, really hope, that the voice chat will be implemented in a good way (like is stating); I atleast think it's a step in the right directon since it certainly will help smaller groups and maybe som arena teams who don't have an Vent / TS server and where sound quality (if it's implemented badly) might not be a big issue. :)<br />
<br />

This Nerf.. err &quot;Hotfix&quot;, means nothing for (Enhancement-)Shamans, since they use their &quot;Windfury Weapon&quot;-Spell/Enchant and don't benefit from Windfury Totem, and Hunter's Pets (they, like druids, don't proc Windfury).</div></div><hr />

Having to rely more on the Blizz content instead of downloading a mod. For instance the threat meter they're looking at doing would eliminate having to use KTM or Omen cause the one in game would account for all aggro that is distributed throughout a fight. Slowly but surely they're making our mods available in-game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your assumption is that blizz is trying to create/develop their own VOIP system. <br />
What if they used an outside software vendor to create the VOIP codec and then blizz coded it to the game. <br />
There are several pieces of software on the market the utilize separate software components.<br />
WOW should be no different. <br />
maybe they went this route?</div></div><hr />
