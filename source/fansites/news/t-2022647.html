The Burning Legion is heading our way and to help thin the number of demons already in the lands of Azeroth, we’ve teamed up with various community members to set a bounty on their heads.<br />
<br />
We’ve gathered some of our finest generals from the community to lead the onslaught. You’ll want to follow them closely and be ready to jump into the fray to take on the demon they issue a bounty on. Once the demon is targeted, you’ll be asked to head into Azeroth, Outland, or Draenor, to screenshot any demon of that specific type (dead or alive), and tweet it using the associated hashtag.<br />
<br />
Your efforts could result in netting you a key to the Legion beta test and joining the thousands who have already been testing the upcoming expansion.<br />

So doing 8am-6pm PST / 4pm-2am BST.. where most americans cant participate, and most europeans can only take advantage of about half of it... Is somehow better than, say.. Doing it on the weekend. or several days long. or region specific<br />

<br />
Yeah they've already had thousands of keys to give out, It's getting silly.<br />
<br />
I'd prefer if they went back to random invites for the majority and a few keys given out for contests, Not to streamers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, no idea why they would promote streamer culture by proxy. Especially when not too long ago they came out themselves and said streamers are bad for first impressions of a beta due to the streamers trying to monetize and as such will often influence their reactions to playing with that in mind.<br />
<br />
That said they still created that problem themselves so I don't feel sorry for them at all. I just find it funny that despite having problems with it recently Blizzard still continues with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got WoD beta key for some reason and used it mainly to check new models because i did not want to spoil myself. (if i had known better lol) All the numerous bugs i reported about new models were not even touched. So i'm not really even wanting beta keys anymore. And in same time there's idiots playing who got beta key and think it's finished game, whining because nothing works. It's stupid and frustrating.<br />
<br />
Btw, iirc there was going to be some facebook-streaming-shit system incoming in future? Next expansion beta key competition will be in facebook, haha. <br />

For example Towellie who seems to average around 2k people has around 7k in his channel now. All this does is line the pockets of the streamers while just pissing off many people because they don't want to do all of this bullshit for a chance at a beta key. <br />

We are a few weeks away from the PTR and less than two month ago from beta, at this point it's just a bonus event for people really into wow to have some more chance. I won't be entering since I don't have a twitter account and don't plan to create one but the point is that it's just an extra bonus. As you said it's just random, if you don't want to do it just don't, but I don't understand all the hate...</div></div><hr />

How are you actually in control of that type of giveaways? Post a random pic @ the right time /profit. Alrdy in the beta? Who cares /profit. Ofc they should keep the random invites if they cant come up with something better than give a streamer # of keys. That(the random invite waves) way ppl who are alrdy in wont get a 2nd or a 3rd key like it is now ive seen a person winning like 4 keys from those random streamer giveaways in which you press accept or you type a word.</div></div><hr />

I know it's probably super effective when it comes to creating some &quot;social media buzz&quot; about your game and that is the whole point of these events but it just feels so shitty. Since I started playing WoW I've signed up to every single beta and got zero invites, bad luck I guess and guess what? I'm fine with it. What is so grating though is that they probably end up giving away thousands of keys to these G2A sponsored streamers that live on money either from shady 2nd hand market game keys or manipulating people into giving donations. They are basically cam whores but without the fun part. But like I said, I get it, Twitch is a big deal now even though I think 99.9% of the stuff on Twitch is just the lowest kind of &quot;entertainment&quot; and it's sad that Blizzard caters to this bullshit.</div></div><hr />

Like 13 month of not-existant content? Or giving more tool to self-absorbed streamers to get more subs and donations for themselves?

Actually there is something wrong with it. Why do only certain streamers get this attention? There are other WoW/Blizzard streamers that get ignored. Why not run their own events to engage the community instead of forcing people to do silly things via twitter or even worse go to streamers they wouldn't normally watch hoping to get a beta key. <br />
<br />

<br />
They cant hand out keys to every fucking person who wants one. They limit the keys so that they can to targeted, concentrated testing. If they wanted to stress test their servers, they would give out keys to basically anyone who wanted one (like they did with Overwatch).<br />
<br />
Stop crying just because you haven't gotten a beta key. There are already plenty of testers and they are working out the bugs and kinks. Do you think adding an extra random tester such as yourself with do anything to help with the process at this point in beta? At this point, any extra key given out is just hooking up their fans with an early preview of the expansion.<br />
<br />
Be more grateful.</div></div><hr />

You are just one person amongst billions, you are not special. Get over it.

I'd rather Blizzard just gave away keys like they did before, you know, invite waves. Now the &quot;beta&quot; is just a promotional event and I guess we just have to live with that. But I'd rather not see Blizzard being in the same bed as these G2A sponsored streamers.</div></div><hr />

I've always up voted the comments pointing out that beta isn't early access, but the way Legion keys have been handled is different. It's been contest after contest. The beta is being touted as a prize for an early preview. So while I've seen some vastly immature people, I do get where a lot of the salt is coming from. But, it's giving Blizzard publicity either way so they're still getting what they want to help sell the game. <br />
<br />
I've been in most of the betas though, &amp; I have to say this one is worse than usual with people who have obviously not played in years or not at all. I get that it helps sell game copies, but when I see questions in trade on beta that make it painfully obvious the person has no clue about the game at all then I lose a bit of faith on the beta being for testing so much as just being a marketing tool.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decyde</div><div class="date">2016-07-06, 05:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, instead of rewarding active players who have been loyal for 5 to 10 years, they give out keys for them to jump through hoops in the hopes of winning.<br />
<br />
That's about as shitty as a majority of accounts on wowheads giveaways being created in June. Then after the give away, there's a bunch of keys on eBay or trying to be traded in game for money.<br />
<br />
We are inside 60 days until launch...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The event not being done the way some people prefer doesn't sound like a proper excuse for all the negativity. It sounds more like a prime example of entitlement.<br />
<br />
With these attitudes, you all are more likely to entirely demotivate Blizzard from going forward with dev-organized or dev/streamer/youtuber collab community events such as these (which could be really fun and positive in the game, and have 0 involvement with streamers or social media in the future), rather than to make them create better events.</div></div><hr />

But ofc beta these days is about publicity rather than actually giving it to people who will actually test.<br />
<br />
Well lets be honest...to most people a beta key is nothing more than free early access...a try before you buy mechanic.<br />
<br />
Not saying you aren't right...but I don't imagine a whole lot of people go onto the beta to actually forward it.</div></div><hr />

Eh people have every right to voice their negative opinions just like people have every right to have the opposite opinion. If there's enough negative feedback and they don't events like this again then I guess it shows the community doesn't like these events. On the other hand if the complaints are the minority that won't happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, if I'm not getting paid to make a company's product better I don't feel a massive obligation to do so. That doesn't mean I don't test some stuff, but I'm not going to treat it like a job when they have people who are being paid to do the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the part that's annoying me....<br />
<br />
It's not hard to take a few pictures and post them up if that's the hoops we have to jump through. But spamming the same tweets all day hurts anyone with a job/classes/etc even more than the ridiculous hours of this &quot;event&quot; already do. <br />
<br />
But, of course, that's just me being mad at Blizzard, not you. Congrats on your key!</div></div><hr />

It's not the give-away people are upset about. It's the fact that Blizzard again choose to rub dicks with Streamers. When they have already made a statement that they think Streamers are bad for them and the community because it shows people the full expansion even if you don't have access.<br />

LOL, the goal of this 'promotion' isn't to get people to test their game. It is only going to cause people to log on the beta and derp around. If they wanted dedicated TESTERS they'd go a different direction and get people that would actually test and report bugs.

No, the streamers are not &quot;giving&quot; us anything. This is Blizzard deciding to funnel keys through the streamers instead of just sending them out in random waves.

<br />
Its not Blizzard's stream. Its blizzard's beta keys that they GIVE to the streamers to distribute how they see fit within the parameters of the contest. And I think Towliee is right. People who only go on their streams to get free shit are really not welcome on the streams. He would rather give keys to his dedicated viewers instead of random assholes who go on his stream, talk shit and only expect free stuff. So this &quot;insulting the playerbase&quot; you claim is just your over sensitive self getting riled up because he doesn't like giving keys to people who don't deserve them.</div></div><hr />

Spot on. The same amount of keys would be in the community if Blizz just gave them out in waves. Sure this generates some attention but it is bad along with good attention. <br />
<br />
I also love the 'hype' argument people use. If a game of this size needs the help of streamers that get less than 10k viewers during these events help then the game is fucking doomed.</div></div><hr />

Lolwut? Towliee is one of the biggest mercenaries (read whores) on Twitch. That guy has spent plenty of time giving out keys to various other games over his years on Twitch. If his goal was to not have people there for free shit then the giveaways would be sub-only or even better he would not advertise his stream title as BETA GIVEAWAYS and so on. I mean RIGHT NOW his stream title is &quot;Legion Beta Lunch| Beta Keys X200&quot; and then gives out his curse info. <br />
<br />
Stop deluding yourself into thinking these streamers don't have an agenda.<br />

<br />
Why exactly is it a fucking bad thing that Blizzard decides to be generous to their community and hold fun contests like this to give out beta keys to people?<br />
<br />
If anything, you should be thanking Blizzard and the streamers, not flinging bile toxic shit their way. You don't deserve anything.<br />
<br />
Fun contests? You mean see who can spam him the most? <br />
<br />
If I take a screenshot and go into the world I should have an equal chance. I shouldn't have to jump through hoops like a show dog and try to impress these streamers. It's shameless, it's just a way to plug these people. Why do these players get to decide if I'm worthy.<br />
<br />
I don't care if I lose in a fair contest, the issue is this isn't a fair contest.</div></div><hr />

And yet again Facebook and Twitter are used as the only tools to even remotely test content and give feedback.. Oh wait those people will be selling their keys of course.<br />
Pathetic way to promote a product is all I have to say, and a big &quot;fuck you&quot; to people who actually do care about the product/want to give feedback.<br />
I won't bother with any giveaways anymore, no more stupid selfie-twitter crap, and let all those &quot;quality&quot; testers enjoy flooding the servers just to toss a ball around.<br />
No more feedback from me is what Blizzard will get and I will abuse bugs/hacks I find which you so blatantly ignore.<br />

Problem is twitter is ultra shitty, it takes forever to scroll to the first posts. Some streamers may use the random draw tool that only counts 1 entry though (like toweli did partially). Posting your picture every 5 minutes is a good way to increase chances to get seen. <br />
<br />
Twitter suxx, slowly loading shitpage, doesnt allow to view all tweets at same time without pressing 10000000000 buttons.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it's terrible, the only way to do it fairly is to do the RNG draw site.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't mind losing a contest that I felt like I had a chance in, but right now I don't feel like I have any chance.</div></div><hr />

Just make an in-game contest. It can be a test of skills, PvE/PvP, or even a more casual lottery among, say, who did succeed in some heroic dungeon/mythic dungeon/rbg in a given day, or completed a given quest.<br />
<br />
There's no reason to push these in-game activities outside the game itself.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what im talking about. These self entitled whiners just think that they should get free keys without having to do anything. This is just a fun way to distribute keys to people who WANT a key and will post a fun picture of a demon on twitter.<br />
<br />
All i can say, is if you refuse to get on board with twitter, then you don't get a key. Plain and simple. Stop whining and either do what the contest asks of you or dont participate.<br />
<br />
I've never seen such a big deal made out of a harmless giveaway.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, just shows how toxic the community has become. They're angry when Blizzard doesn't do anything to include them, and they're angry when they create events that requires players to be involved somehow no matter how simple...</div></div><hr />

Not to mention the lack of preparation on behalf of the streamers (so far) but twitter just isn't a good platform for this at all. <br />

This should have all been done through the official Warcraft twitch or twitter to give clues on where to find events that happen IN GAME. Non of this out-of-game bullshit, The streamers are quite happily telling us how *fun* this event is..

Oh and Toweliee's little rant at the end there insulting anyone who doesn't watch streams, Insulting anyone who didn't like his self-promoting event and generally being a 'superior-than-thou' 'you-don't-deserve-us' dick was nothing short of disgusting. I've been a follower of his for a long time but I won't be anymore, what an attitude.

I agree. When I first heard about this I imagined that we would kill demons IN GAME and have a small chance to loot a special item that would grant beta access. Now that would be cool. <br />

I blame them both to be honest, the streamers have known about it for weeks. Either way, it's a bit silly to do it like this.<br />
<br />
Bajeera knew that the guy already had a key, and he knew the other guys picture wasn't a real screenshot. But he said &quot;it's cool enough to bypass the rules.&quot; That is unfair to everyone following the rules. He took a key that someone that followed the rules could have got.<br />

Hey man, I want to win one too but I'm gonna be realistic about it. Blizzard could've facilitated it better or guided them to use a certain method instead of letting them all decide at the last minute how to do it, i.e. scrolling through the most recent submissions which are mostly from people spamming to stay at the top of the live feed.</div></div><hr />

You know, I am with you. Must be us &quot;old fogies&quot; who actually had an NES or remember going to the arcade that feel this way though. I have to shake my head that people actually PAY MONEY (sorry I mean Donate) to watch other people play instead of playing the darn game themselves!

<br />
I have played on and off since Vanilla, every single expansion. I have played MMO's since Kunark era EQ1...and been in the beta for different expansions for every EQ game, FF MMO, and scores of other MMO's through the years...giving good feedback and testing as much as I could to help get a quality release product.<br />
<br />
Not once in all the years have I been in a WoW beta. Not once. Ever. I hear how Joe's cousin Jim Bob played for 3 months 6 years ago and got emailed 3 invites he pawned off on Ebay for a few hundred bucks...but God forbid someone who actually enjoys WoW and is a competent, fair beta tester type get one single one ever.<br />
<br />
Its because I am not in an uber guild, doing Mythic raids....if I were I would be fine. But because im in my 40's and realize life doesnt need to include raiding Im like a leper lol. If I just didnt renew my sub every time I quit cause I missed the game, I would probably score an invite. If i didnt have 10 level 100's I would probably get one....but im always subbed more than 3/4 of a year every single year. I play 20+ hours a week when I am subbed. As is I am a consistent money source for Blizzard therefore low on the totem pole for an invite to try to woo me to spend money.</div></div><hr />

Any streamer who says you have to Sub to win a Beta key should be reported to Blizzard immediately as this is against their rules for conducting beta key giveaways. SUBS DO WIN because they are considered apart of the stream normally and have equal chance as a normal follower to win as well. As long as everyone has equal chance it is ok. And sorry you do not understand streaming and publisher/developer relations. Hoping some day the bridge can be gaped on separation of communities who don't know difference between it all.</div></div><hr />

If your goal is to get people beta testing as many hours as possible it makes 100% sense to do it during times when most people are at work, helping you make sure to get more people with more free time (students/unemployed/etc)</div></div><hr />

They covered a pretty large window of times. People didn't actually have to watch the streams to win, just had to participate. The streamers were merely highlighted during those windows and did a large portion of their giveaways while hosted by Blizz. I don't give any streamers money, and I keep a stream open to pass the time. I don't know how the other guys did theirs, but Towelliee, Slootbag and Sparty all had largely interactive streams. It's more than just watching people play, there are communities that form in the chats and for many that's why they watch. I think Blizzard did well thinking outside the box, and there are still random invites going out too. One of my guildmates got a random invite just a week or two ago.</div></div><hr />

WoW has the most toxic community I've ever had the displeasure of interacting with. I love WoW, but the majority of people playing are not the type of people you want to interact with. That's evident from the bile left on the comments section of the announcement. However I do think Toweliee was definitely out of line with his insults to the player base, basically to anyone not already one of his followers. I was listening to his rant, and essentially it was &quot;if you don't already follow me, I don't want you watching my stream, and you don't deserve me&quot;. Such ego.<br />
<br />
I'm not a fan of streamers by any means. I don't watch streams, they're just not my thing. Do I wish that Blizzard had chosen a different type of contest? Yes. But on the other hand, I don't hold anything against them doing this contest. They didn't have to do it at all. And there's nothing wrong with the idea of this contest in my opinion. It was the execution that completely ballsed it up. I'm only just reading about what happened in Wowhead's comment section now, because I took all my screenshots, tweeted them all at the same time, and that was that. But to allow the streamers to just do whatever they wanted is a complete joke. Blizzard SHOULD have put strict rules in place and heavily moderated it. Each streamer had an allotted time slot, so why has one been permitted to forgo that time slot and choose when to do it himself, despite the fact that it's Blizzard that organised the separate times? <br />
<br />
I'd hope that Blizzard doesn't do this sort of thing this way again anytime soon (although they have a track record of recognising something doesn't work and then doing it again anyway). Or at least if they do do it, they enforce very strict rules, or just forget the streamers and do it themselves.<br />
<br />
On another note, during Towelliee's stream, he gave his thoughts on various comments, with one being along the lines of &quot;streamers are just ordinary players, except they record their gameplay&quot;. And his reply to that comment was &quot;that's not just it, we do a lot more than just record&quot;. Seriously, what else do they do? The quote is literally streamers in a nutshell. What do streamers do other than just record gameplay?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice implications, but no. I doubt he makes more money than me and I also happen to like my job. My job also doesn't rely on begging for donations to keep me afloat and actually gives useful work experience. Whereas a professional streamer is no more than just someone who plays video games. What's gonna happen when the donations stop coming in? Enjoy flippin burgers for a living :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

People seem to have this notion that you have to be GOOD at something to be known or successful on Twitch. No offense but being amazing a game does not equal you will have a community backing and thousands watching you. This is the same disconnect in thought process of streaming I'm always talking about. I mean is it just damn luck that streamers like myself have avg'd 2-4k viewers 100 million views over last 5 years? Playing the lotto tonight boys. Majority of people here have no idea what streaming is about. Besides of course being beggers, sluts, money grubbing, hungry, blah blah stuff &lt;insertusualignorantcommenthere&gt;</div></div><hr />

technically yes it is a dumb luck that you and few others have been chosen by blizzard/activision to promote their shit - if it wasnt for legion beta give aways and hardware you give away how many viewers would you have ? <br />
<br />
i want to be understand corrckly - yes you are doin very good job as pure entertainer of certain kind of audience that enjoys stream made mainly out of vaping/burping/speaking about stupid shit instead of doin what a beta tester should be doin and its ok - you choose the role of &quot;clown&quot; and people like it - more power to you and i wish you best - but dont pretend like you dont owe this mainly to X,Y,Z companies that decided to use you as marketing &quot;tool&quot; .<br />
without marketing depertment decisions of those comapnies that decided to promote you and you alike your audience would be much lower and you know it.<br />
<br />
yes you have 4k viewers but we all know why - because of &quot;i give beta invites away &quot; - without it your stream doesnt hold much value as beta tester and you knwo it while openly admiting that you are not good at the game itself.<br />
<br />
<br />

oh but they do - there are valuable streamers who do geniuine beta testing liek finalboss etc , people like preach who doesnt stream much but do a ton of youtube content filled with valuable information , people who make geniuine interesting content - and then there are people like you and swifty - who make low quality product wrapped in golden paper of marketing and targeted towards specific audience - and its ok but saying its somethign more is nothing but hipocrisy .<br />
<br />
and i say it from position of someone workign in fashion world where 99 % of my work is selling low quality shit with a label which magically makes it look as very valuable object - but if people who buy those product knew from whats its made and in which conditions they would never buy it especially if they knew how little company spends on production and how expensive they sell it for - but hey its the marketing department magic done correckly all you need if to hire some stupid celebrity to promote it and convince people that they desire exackly this shit wrpped in golden paper</div></div><hr />

Sorry but if you want the numbers I can easily give them to you. YES of course Beta brings in more viewers. Even more that I am most consistent streamer in my time slot. Before August 2015 I was still averaging 2.3k Views and now I avg 3.5-4.5. That is big in my eyes not others. I have dedicated 5 years of my time playing WoW and supporting Blizzard on Justin/Twitch since 2010. Where is the hypocrisy there? I don't mind being used as a marketing tool. I support everything I am sponsored by and if that brings more people into my stream to enjoy a good time so be it. Streaming is not luck when you started at 25 viewers and worked in this industry for 5+ years building your brand and networking you ass off to get noticed. You work in fashion? guess you must know? What I do is no different then Preach, FinalBoss and other YouTubers. They produce edited and drafted content. I do mine live without any preparation. (unless it is a paid gig obviously). I give genuine reactions. If I fuck up and look stupid you see it live. if a YT fucks up and looks stupid they can just edit it out and make it look good. There's differences. Do I owe Blizzard my success? Damn right I do. Do I play a huge part in building my own brand through their game? Damn right I do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mystwrath</div><div class="date">2016-07-14, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Still not exactly clear on what the actual value added would be. As I said, mod developers produce mods that are useful or they fade away. Guide producers produce guides that are helpful, or the fade away. Even when they are helpful, Blizzard virtually prohibits any means of monetizing their efforts to recoup value for time spent. They have chosen to do the exact opposite when it comes to streamers. Yes, there is some entertainment value in game play exhibition in streaming, but what elevates this activity above other fan activities that are not so lavishly rewarded by Blizzard. Honestly, you'd get the kind of bump in viewers you're experiencing if you gave away Beta Keys on Adobe Creative. These aren't new customers that are coming to your stream. These are folks who know the product and will or will not purchase the product regardless of what you have for breakfast on your stream. I didn't see Preacher on the &quot;black carpet&quot; at the debut of Warcraft. I haven't heard of any summit where Tatva &amp; Tovo from LoS Gaming were flown out to Blizzard's campus. In short, there is no valid reason beyond reach to involve the streamers they've involved and to be honest, Blizzard's reach through their own stream far exceeds any audience that streamers can provide without duplicating unique viewers. I don't blame streamers for doing what they do. But you provide a show and ask people to pay monies for that show. You're boosting viewership of the show by holding giveaways and lets be honest, some people will believe paying your subscription will give them a better shot at winning regardless of the truth and regardless of how many times you tell them that this is not the case. My issue is not with streamers. My issue is with Blizzard and how they've chosen to hype their game using a quality assurance tool as currency selectively bestowed on a small group of fans for streaming their game. To you and the other streamers, Blizzard is no different than Razer, Nvidia, or Hyperex. They are a client providing you with product to give away as promotion of that product. The difference for me is that I can go out and buy the video card you're giving away. I can download the curse client. Where exactly do they sell Beta Keys legally?</div></div><hr />
