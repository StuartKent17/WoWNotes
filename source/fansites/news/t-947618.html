Description (Taken from Youtube (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkt0sn_BVcM&amp;feature=player_embedded))<br />
Ironically, this was going to be my last attempt for tonight... :)<br />
<br />
LK's main challenges are:<br />
<br />
1) Practice of cooldown usage in p1. They're used *very* strictly and if you don't have that practice, you'll probably wipe in p1 endlessly (which is what I initially did)<br />
2) surviving transition phases. This is insane and requires, again, extremely precise cooldown management and positioning.<br />
3) Finally, the obvious DPS race. This fight lasted an exact 15 minutes, not a single second more or less - I spent the whole evening wiping between 11 and 12% and finally, finally did it, through more Vengeance stacking and better play on my part (oh .. and maybe a lil bit crit RNG I guess? :p).<br />
<br />
<br />
There's no particular clever trick, however, and I honestly think some other solos such as Yogg were *harder* in terms of thinking outside the box. Here I'm basically excecuting the fight as clean as I can, grabbing every possible bit of DPS along the way. However, I didn't encounter any boss so far that was as exhausting as LK was in terms of raw DPS requirements. Especially since, while I do have tons of 391 gear, I'm still rockin' little 372 Akirus. ;) If you think DPS requirements aren't worth of a &quot;challenge&quot;, I guess pre-nerf Baleroc/Cho'gall would like a word with you.<br />
<br />
FAQ:<br />
<br />
Necrotic Plague : cannot target the tank. You need it to clear the ghouls/vrykuls from phase 1, however. The trick is to put an engineer dummy to drop aggro for a split second, LK gives you the plague, outheal it, then proceed. Use either AMS/Chains of Ice or Potion of Purification to remove it/prevent it from affecting you again.<br />
Valks : Buggy as hell. Can't target the tank, they just mess around. They finally stop eating popcorn and grab me at some point... you'll have to watch to see when.<br />
Defile : I stand in some of these on purpose in order to increase Vengeance. It has to be done very carefully, since both p2 and p3 are very healing intensive phases (p2 because of Infest which means I can't dip too low on health, p3 because of vile spirit explosions)<br />
Frostmourne: Yet another mechanic that doesn't target the tank. Wouldn't be difficult to overcome in any way whatsoever, but would make beating the enrage impossible, so I guess that's a good thing it's not there.<br />
<br />
<br />
What's next? It wouldn't be fun if I already told you everything right? Getting surprised is awesome.<br />

Sorry but imo metal blows :P Some rock isn't bad though. How about YOU solo kill LK and put your OWN REAL music in :)<br />

<br />
rock, rock'n'roll and metal is the closest thing you get to REAL music these days (excluding symphony)... what you kids are listening to isn't music, it's beat. on repeat... and it doesn't come close to what real musicians do.<br />
<br />
OT: method's kill video is pretty cool, different tactics than paragon used, although the paragon one imo looks way more badass with the burst aoe and synced movement in p2 :3<br />
<br />
grats to Mione on soloing lich king, it's been brewing for some time huh ? :p<br />
<br />
<br />
Watching the H Rag kill by Method, at 21:20 do I see 14 Seething Cinders dropping from the boss? Or am I seeing things? Gives me hope I may get a staff this expansion<br />

The music in this kill video is absolutely amazing holy mother of god. Two Steps From Hell - United We Stand Divided We Fall is a musical masterpiece. The only people who do not agree probably listen to the mainstream music and have no idea what real talent is all about. +1<br />
<br />

Pretty sure the people complaining about the music are complaining about Mione's vid, not Method's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they want classes to be different. sure they could change dks to use block and get rid of the healing thing but then again he would be just another warrior. And if they would nerf the healing it would mean dks are useless as tank in current raidin content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as i've seen, judging by dates and such on Mione's blog, Raegywn pretty much just took her ideas and became famous by killing the bosses him self and then posting videos with the intention of getting famous, where as Mione just did it for the challenge of doing it.<br />
<br />
But meh, they are both skilled DK's and they both deserve the credit they get. Taking someones way of solo killing a boss is one thing, actually doing it is another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the Method video was amazing too. I agree that the way Paragon handled p2 seems better and easier, but I just loved how p3 was done, everyone staying melee range almost and just knocking the meteors back into the lava. Took the meteors completely out of the game. Very cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also he gave up on LK couple months back stating that he isn't in good enough guild to get the gear required for LK. From what I understood back then they (well at least Raegwynn said so) had the strategy kind of down in 4.0 already but simply didn't have the gear the push through. Mione had better gear than him but still it wasn't enough. Now it is.</div></div><hr />

Actually pugged him when 4.1 came out with everyone on the normal side dead and just me(blood dk) and a pally heals alive on the shadow side, and we downed him. i noticed he wasn't hitting that hard even when he was fully buffed. Improbable maybe, but definitely not impossible.</div></div><hr />

This. DKs just happen to be the best at soloing. If you want to do that then stop QQing about this and just roll a DK. You can hit 85 in a few days easily, then go solo Yogg and LK to your hearts content!</div></div><hr />

3.musical (http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/musical) work or compositions for singing or playing.<br />
seems to fit the definition so shut it keep your opinions to yourself as no one really gives a flying frogs nuts about what you think music should or should not bealso Halion would be an impossible solo as iirc if there isnt somebody on either side he begins to heal at a rather rapid rate</div></div><hr />

However, all the hate people have for the class is based on such events, which in my opinion should only be done for fun, not for exhibitionism, even though I'm not open to my guild about what I solo, I still always get the mild DK-hate jokes, which is annoying, and this probably will be the highlight when I step into our guild vent later on(we are a 10m guild) where everyone saying &quot;Screw DKs, they're frickin' OP, they can heal themselves&quot; and what not where in the meanwhile people will be steamrolled by Frost Mage-Sub Rogue, arms warrior-feral cat combos...</div></div><hr />

Implying people haven't soloed illidan already. I think a hunter and a DK have both done it. Need to confirm though. Still, if you're not a DK, you wont understand how hard this is.<br />
<br />

Its an extraordinary feat to solo LK. That's a fact. If you don't think it is, make yourself an 'easy mode DK' and do it yourself. Its so easy, right?<br />
<br />
Otherwise, shut it. Your making yourself look idiotic in the eyes of every DK out there, and honestly I feel horrible responding to your obvious troll posts and making it worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, first off, this definitely took more skill and patience than 99.99999% of wow's population possesses.<br />
<br />
That said, while comments along the lines of 'derp DK' is out of line in the sense of *trying to imply that this kill was somehow trivial*, anyone who denies that something is a bit wrong with the game when a single player can solo a 25man raid boss 2 levels below them (LK is technically 83 with the way raid bosses work), is a bit out of touch. <br />
<br />
This is important not just because it offends the epeen, or because it shows really bad class design/ balance (sorry, but it does), but because it (get ready)<br />
----&gt; continues to emphasize to the entire player population that non level cap encounters are of little to no importance and basically brushed off as obsolete by the game's developers. Let's flash forward 2-3 years from now and imagine a game with a level cap of 100, where levels 1-99 are pointless grind. Who is going to want to play a game that is INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED to have the first 99% consist of obsolete / broken encounters that are not good for anything AT ALL except rare mount farming and solo skill tests?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly right. The devs could never, and should never balance pvp around 2v2.. Almost anyone with half a brain knows why... because it means they would have to give the exact same abilities to every spec.<br />
<br />
And for DKs and old content.. that is exactly the problem. There are 4 tank specs... The devs want to maintain them different ( i feel pally and warrior are way to similar).. but in any event, the devs want to keep them as unique as possible, but still allow them each to tank current content. That is a major priority for the devs.... but it just so happens that the unique ability of DK tanks makes the better at soloing old content. In order to ´fix´that.. the devs would have to go back to the other 3 tanks and make them more similar to DK tanks. Obviously keeping tanks equal, yet someone different for current content is a much bigger priority (HUGELY MORE IMPORTANT) than worrying about soloing old content.<br />
<br />
How many players in the entire world do you think go back and really try to squeeze out old content. Sure, most of us go back and mess around.. in which case any tank can do it along with a bunch of dps specs. But there are probably only a few dozen, if that, players who would be willing t wipe for 6 hours on LK. Do you really want the devs to adjust the abilities of the other 3 tanks so that those few dozen players can use different specs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely nothing wrong with allowing it.<br />
<br />
There was when paladins were doing it. There apparently was something terribly, terribly wrong with it. Not that it matters to me, just pointing out that many people seemed to have problems with it when it was paladins. Now that it's DKs everyone is fine. <br />
<br />
People shouldn't call for a nerf though, it's obvious this person put in lots of time/effort. They didn't just walk in and randomly get it. So they deserve the recognition they are getting. Oh, and before you think I play DK you should know I quit WoW months ago. Still like the site though for talking with SWTOR fans.</div></div><hr />

I don't recall any such complaints about Paladins, except the Kazzak incident way back when. And what was with that one goes without saying.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akts</div><div class="date">2011-07-31, 08:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly right. The devs could never, and should never balance pvp around 2v2.. Almost anyone with half a brain knows why... because it means they would have to give the exact same abilities to every spec.<br />
<br />
And for DKs and old content.. that is exactly the problem. There are 4 tank specs... The devs want to maintain them different ( i feel pally and warrior are way to similar).. but in any event, the devs want to keep them as unique as possible, but still allow them each to tank current content. That is a major priority for the devs.... but it just so happens that the unique ability of DK tanks makes the better at soloing old content. In order to ´fix´that.. the devs would have to go back to the other 3 tanks and make them more similar to DK tanks. Obviously keeping tanks equal, yet someone different for current content is a much bigger priority (HUGELY MORE IMPORTANT) than worrying about soloing old content. It is a FACT that DK's are the weakest tanks for content of appropriate level ie FL H. So, we have DK tanks unbalanced (OP) at solo old content, unbalanced (UP) at current content... ugh, I'm struggling to understand are they supposed to be balanced at all? I guess the devs think they are not.<br />
It's just disturbing that the devs came up with a self-healing tank idea.<br />
- What do we have on DKs?<br />
- Give them self healing!<br />
- So we are giving the toughest character in the game the ability to heal and themselves and scale that abillty with mastery? Sounds wonderful!<br />

To evade the adds you must go on the stairs. Which she does to get rid of a few sets of adds. Once her cooldowns are all up she soaks the spirits up.<br />

It's because they trapped ragnaros too early by accident meaning they didn't have a trap for when he cast empowered sulfuras, so after ragnaros cast empowered sulfuras the boss would've blown up the raid if it meleed sco so he just jumped off, pretty lols tbh<br />

Why does everyone conveniently ignore the fact that Blood Legion's (World 10) main tank is a Blood DK? They got a world first Heroic: Beth kill and other top ranked kills? I would say that they are just fine for heroic progression. Other good guilds like Ropetown (they aren't ranked as high as BL, but still a good guild nonetheless) also uses a Blood DK.</div></div><hr />

Duels are NOT PvP, and no matter how balanced the game gets, there will always be certain comps that just naturally are better, &quot;balance&quot; won't fix that</div></div><hr />

apparently you dont understand what skill cap means, you could probably pick up a blood dk and do decently with it in heroics without actually knowing the entirety of the spec but to actually fully master the spec and all its intricacies is harder than any other current spec out there.<br />
<br />
also gimme a spec i dare you that isnt dk that you think isnt faceroll to such extremes that you claim blood dks are i and pretty much any person with any competence in this game could pick it up within 1hr tops and be able to play it at above average level the specs are just that easy for the vast majority of the classes</div></div><hr />

Just because you say ´fact´ doesn´t make it so. There are plenty of top guilds with DKs as main tank. It is actually very evenly split.<br />
<br />
Again.. yeah, they have great self-healing... and in current endgame, it makes up about as much as a Bears shield ( duh, which also scales with master) and Pally and Warrior blocking (duh, which also scales with mastery). You seem somehow shocked that a DKs mastery lets them remove some of the damage they receive?.. when that is exactly what other tanks do. <br />
<br />
But again.. there are only a few players who would spend 6 hours wiping to old content just to kill it... do we really want the devs balancing classes around those few people. It is an insignicant number of people doing it, and there is NO reward for doing it. The gear that LK drops is about the same as what I got on my first quest in Hyjal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If the devs would use more of their brains and start seperating pvp from pve (*waves at aion*), things would start to get balanced. Imagine no pve skills in your talentscreen while being on a pvp server. Or no pvp talents while on a pve server. How would you feel? No, I dont even start to imagine what would happen to tank specs because I play a lock mostly. <br />
<br />

you need to read the deathstrike tooltip and blood dk mastery.<br />
Death Strike:A deadly attack that deals 150% weapon damage plus 330, healing you for 20% of the damage you have sustained during the preceding 5 sec (minimum of at least 7% of your maximum health).<br />
Blood Shield is based on that heal though it scales at an extremely poor rate in comparison to block<br />
<br />
it has nothing to do with our damage</div></div><hr />

Base damage for Chain Lightning is higher, but Lightning Bolt scales better with SP. Single target it does significantly more damage than Chain Lightning even with the longer cast time.<br />
<br />
Also the Lightning Bolt glyph increases its damage by 4%</div></div><hr />
