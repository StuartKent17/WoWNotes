need a few glyphs for tankadin's already ~.~<br />
<br />
Chances are it won't stack. And major glyphs for tankadins: Glyph of Vengeance/Corruption, Glyph of Judgement/Spiritual Attunement, Glyph of Righteous Defense.<br />
<br />
<br />
The new glyphs, or changes to glyphs, look great for the most part. Paladins looking fantastic on all ends; FoL glyph might be worth getting for those who spam it, and a free Hammer of Wrath? Really? That's gonna be nerfed to 50% reduc, most likely, but things are still looking very good.</div></div><hr />

My main thought was when you've been mana-burned to nothing, and need to finish them off. It's a very, very powerful spell that would've been useless after being drained of mana, but now is much more potent.</div></div><hr />

-- By the way: <br />
Glyph of Flash of Light - Your Flash of Light has an additional 5% critical strike chance. (Old - Your Flash of Light heals for 50% less initially, but also heals for 140% of its inital effect over 12 sec.)<br />
Noes my alts &quot;hot&quot; (nah, I'm not using this glyph actually but..) is gone.. or wait, 5% crit chance. That's kind of a huge buff, really! (or?)<br />
And <br />
Healing Way doesn't stack up to 3 times anymore and now increases the effect of subsequent Healing Wave spells on the target by 18%. (Up from 6%) Finally =) Was getting tired of loosing 3 stacks, because there was no use what so ever to waste mana on the current buffed target again within those 15 seconds the buff lasted. Now I don't need to worry about loosing the buff.. since it will be a fully stacked one from first cast =D<br />

Unfortunately, the recipe has a 20 hour cooldown, so I can't make another to compare.<br />

<br />
Apparently, the 3.0.8 PTR is currently using an outdated server software that still thinks it's part of the Beta, but isn't.<br />
<br />
Soo... anyone who participated in the WotLK Beta, in ANY form, cannot currently access the 3.0.8 PTR do to account-binding conflicts.<br />
<br />
(3.0.8 PTR runs a Beta check and asks for your Beta account information, but then fails when it tries to use it)<br />

No.. It's a glyph, and the base &quot;spell&quot; ain't 10 minutes.. so it wont be useable in arena.. <br />
Correct me if I'm wrong. But I don't think talents/glyphs &amp; extras that reduces a spells cd to a 10 minute, will make it arena viable.</div></div><hr />

Unless they nerf the drop rate on the relics, this will be the easiest rep to grind. Which I do not agree with. There will be no point to the everfrost chips if all it takes is 10 relics to get 250 rep. Sure chips give 350, but those relics drop like 90% of the time off a mob.</div></div><hr />

They complained that people were raiding in pvp gear, so what do they do? Add hit rating to pvp gear again. Most classes have talent to give them the 5% they need (missing against a tank shouldn't matter) and for those that don't, there are bunchs of new enchants that cover hit rating. So the majority od the &quot;Titan-forged&quot; gear from wintergrasp will now be using in raiding once aquired. <br />
<br />
The second thing are the 2 trinkets that they added to the wintergrasp loot. <br />
Anvil of Titans<br />
84 Resilience<br />
1000AP Chance on Hit.<br />
<br />
Flow of Knowledge<br />
84 Critical Strike rating<br />
590SP Chance on cast.<br />
<br />
So melee gets resilience while casters get crit rating? You just gave every caster they best trinket in game for next to nothing and melee got screwed. I am honestly just hoping this was a mistake and will be chance once the PTR is working. <br />
<br />
Blizzard said they wanted pvp geat to get people in the door to raiding, not giving them their best gear, didn't they learn anything from the arena in Burning crusade?</div></div><hr />

This list is obtained by comparing spell data between the latest PTR version and the current live version, PTR patches are sometimes pushed live with outdated data and aren't 100% reliable. (Well, that's why they're TEST servers)<br />

Frost<br />
Frostbite doesn't reduce the cast time of Frostfire Bolt anymore. (See this post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=13392250928&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#9))<br />
<br />
<br />
That Frostbite change never made it to live servers. The comment was from first PTR build to second - not from live to beta as the description of section say it should be.</div></div><hr />

(Old - Your Ghoul receives an additional 20% of your Strength)<br />
<br />
Is this a typo?<br />
<br />
I thought (Old - Your Ghoul receives an additional 20% of your Strength) was what you got when you used Glyph of the Ghoul, and for Glyph of Raise Dead you got 20 Runic Power.<br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
Did I miss read something?<br />

Thank you.</div></div><hr />

I've just been on the PTR's myself, I'm on it now. I can confirm these changes. I have taken screenies of the helm changes as an example:<br />

<br />
It says &quot;Resilience&quot; not resistance, so the main page comment is wrong?<br />
<br />
<br />
But there already is a resilience flask (Lesser Flask of Toughness (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40079)), so more likely it's the tooltip that is wrong.</div></div><hr />
