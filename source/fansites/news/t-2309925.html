Prescience Your attacks have a chance to reduce the remaining cooldown on one of your powerful abilities by 5 4 sec. Approximately 3 procs per minute.</div></div><hr />

Shamanistic Healing (Rank 1) When your health drops below 35% -&gt; 1%<br />
<br />
Health below 1% isn't pretty much dead?<br />
<br />
Very likely to be typo or mistake.<br />
<br />
Looks like a problem in MMO-C spell thingy, the tooltips still show it fine. Fixed 35% with increasing healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes the old 4p was way too strong, but now its screwing up the very precise timing. The rotation for mindbender is just going to be off, and its going to be considerably more clunky without a few % more haste.<br />
We're talking something like 25k haste to make up for that change. Most likely scenario for us if this goes live is to get 950~ TF T20 pieces and keep the old 4pc tbh. It's a god awful change and they pretty much have to get us a 10% baseline decreased drain rate if this goes live (with additional balancing around it ofc).</div></div><hr />

&quot;have 15% increased chance to critically strike&quot; <br />

with 30% crit, shouldn't that be just 34,5% chance instead of 45%?</div></div><hr />

I don't know why you would say that. There have still been no information about 7.3.5.<br />
<br />

I am wondering more about the last line; Rank 8. Since when could we get more than rank 7? (4 standard + 3 from traits) Is this hinting at another revamp of the artifact traits?</div></div><hr />

Well the tooltip is likely showing the current build text, not the PTR/proposed changes. Regardless, the 1% is still incorrect.</div></div><hr />

Nah, it's a flat 15% increased chance to crit. In order for it to work in the way you explained it, it would have to say 15% increased critical strike rating AFAIK.</div></div><hr />

i dont think so, with the set bonus it should be additive to your existing crit. atleast i think</div></div><hr />
