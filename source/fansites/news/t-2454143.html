Island Expedition Rewards Update<br />
Patch 8.1 will change Island Expedition rewards from being based on the NPCs you kill to the NPCs that are on the island. <br />
In Tides of Vengeance, in addition to two new Island Expeditions, we’re making a number of adjustments and improvements to Islands. One of those changes will alter how various cosmetic rewards are determined, and we’d like to explain that further, as we promised here: https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1065080683058487297<br />
<br />
Currently in Battle for Azeroth, Island Expeditions have a chance to reward cosmetic items based on which type of creatures you and your team defeated. For example, if the island theme of the week was Hozen, there’s a chance to receive one of the Banana toys. If the invaders were Nerubian, you could have a chance to receive the Voru’kar Leecher companion pet (among other things). They way this has worked is by means of a hidden scorecard that counted your group’s efforts against anything on the island that was part of the invaders’ ecology. So if anyone in the group earned some Azerite from killing invaders or mining Azerite near the invaders, everyone in the group had a chance at the cosmetic rewards. That chance grew based on how much invaders’ Azerite was obtained, and was also a higher chance in Heroic and even higher in Mythic difficulty Islands. We set the maximum chance you could earn at a reasonable threshold, in the hopes that players wouldn’t feel that they needed to only kill invaders and not complete the islands in a natural way.<br />
<br />
Of course, that’s not how it worked out. Confusion around the best way to get cosmetics led to a divergence in playstyles, with some players wishing to focus exclusively on hunting specific creatures, while others wished to win the island efficiently to get Azerite. This caused a significant amount of tension between players who had differing goals.<br />
<br />
In Tides of Vengeance, all players on an Expedition will have a chance to receive cosmetic rewards based on the island’s inhabitants, rather than which enemies were specifically defeated. That chance will again be higher on higher difficulties, but there will be no need to strategize around invaders. The most efficient way to receive cosmetic rewards will be whatever tactics cause you to complete the Island quickly, on the highest difficulty that you’re comfortable.<br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone who has stormed our high seas with feedback on this. We really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Pet Battle Dungeon - Gnomeregan<br />
It’s time to martial your menagerie and put your best battle pets forward within the halls of Gnomeregan.<br />
<br />
To get started on your journey, you’ll need to have earned the achievement All Growns Up! (https://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/6570-all-growns-up), which requires you to raise a pet to level 25. This will make a new quest available to you from Radek Fuselock (https://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/147641-radek-fuselock), who is located near the pet battle trainers in Dazar’alor, or Tizzy Gearjolt, who is located just outside of Dana Pull’s shop in Hook Point in Boralus. You won’t need to complete the Wailing Caverns or Deadmines pet battle dungeons to gain access, and with the release of the Tides of Vengeance content update, you’ll be able to play the three pet battle dungeons in any order.<br />
<br />
Completing the quest and pet battle dungeon the first time earns you an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/122457-ultimate-battle-training-stone). You’ll also be able to avail yourself of Manapoof’s aid to teleport directly to Gnomeregan’s dungeon entrance as a part of the quest reward.<br />
<br />
For those daring to push your team, you can take on the Challenge Mode version of the dungeon, which requires you to have at least 15 maximum-level battle pets. This will open an account-wide weekly quest that you can pick up from Micro Zoox, who’s waiting outside the Gnomeregan instance portal.<br />
<br />
Completing the Challenge Mode the first time will grant the achievement Pet Battle Challenge: Gnomeregan (https://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/13269-pet-battle-challenge-gnomeregan), which rewards a Mini Spider Tank (https://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/147838-mini-spider-tank) battle pet. Return each week to complete the quest and you’ll earn the reward Pristine Gizmo, which can be exchanged for items from Micro Zoox including an Unopened Gnomeregan Supply Box (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/165839-unopened-gnomeregan-supply-box), Mechanical Cockroach (https://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/147671-mechanical-cockroach), Schematic: Mechantula (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/165844-schematic-mechantula), Leper Rat Tail (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/165855-leper-rat-tail), and Rechargeable Alarm-O-Dog Battery (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/165857-rechargeable-alarm-o-dog-battery).<br />
<br />
Whether you’re new to pet battle dungeons or a companion-combat veteran, you’ll want to get in on the ongoing story as it unfolds. Who are the shadowy figures that keep appearing? What do they want? What are their nefarious plans? Discover what awaits your critter pals next in Gnomeregan!</div></div><hr />

It’s not really a bandaid just a flat fix. You’ll no longer have to try and stall out the island so you can kill a rare while the randoms just rush ahead.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like before, I will continue to do heroics as that has been without a doubt the most consistent for getting rewards for me.<br />
Thankfully there will be less confusion now in how rewards are obtained and the realization that lemming teammates are screwing it all up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's odd as it takes the one piece of player agency (what you kill) out of the loot system. It doesn't change the RNG overload required for loot unless the drop chances have been increased again.<br />
<br />
It also doesn't address how what is on the island for loot purposes is decided. Is the invasion decided at the start and those mobs count whether it spawns or not?</div></div><hr />

They might be whining, but they aren't wrong. People complained about the rng factor regarding island rewards. So blizzard took away what little control we had, making it even more of an rng fiesta and passing it off as a &quot;fix&quot;. Yet people are still praising blizzard for taking away more and more player agency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would agree on this. Most people have zero clue how to get loot out of the islands currently and trying to game them to have the best chance at loot currently means playing them in ways the whole design of the island seems contradict.<br />
<br />
With this change especially if they clarify you can get the invasion boss loot without having to find/kill them you won't have to worry about weird sand bagging to get the invasion stuff to spawn and not have to worry people are looting the random azerite nodes to fast.<br />
<br />
Now just play the island complete it and have your chance for items for the stuff that could drop off that island. That should make for a lot more consistent feel.<br />
<br />
I do believe they need to change the spawn triggers for the final invasion event for heroic/mythic. Those fights are interesting and add fun to the experience but on higher difficulties by the time the invasion wave with the portals spawn the match is already over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair I prefer to have flat out chance for reward than pursuing some specific rares or objects on the Island. I wanna have done them as fast as possible because I dont enjoy them and when you get different people in the party (one who wanna hunt specific rares and other who does not give a fuk) its just annoying. <br />
<br />
Also the drop from specific rares wasnt 100% chance so how is this &quot;adding more rng&quot;? For me its less because you now dont have to kill those mobs at all.</div></div><hr />

Wait how is there more rng now then before? Now you either get the loot when you finish or you don’t where before you needed to get a group willing to stall out and island if your playing solo and hope the enemy team doesn’t kill the mobs you want.</div></div><hr />

But changes to 8.1 would already had fixed this, without ruining the expeditions! Invasions are still the fastest way to grind azerite, instead of grinding croc #742. In 8.1 the Azerite giant wont neccesarily spawn, but be part of an invasion pool. With this change, every single item can drop, and you have NO WAY of influencing it. You'll never get your last mount now.</div></div><hr />

Only items from that island enemies can drop not every single item. so if you want your last mount grind it on the week it rotates in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before this fix, you were able to target specific loot. Say you wanted the tiki-bound blade, your group could go in and focus on murdering trolls. Kill all the trolls and finish the island by killing no-loot mobs (crocs, bears, tigers, etc) and mining. At this point you have 2 layers of rng. Loot - yes/no. If yes, you have a 1 in 11 chance of getting the transmog you were after.<br />
<br />
Now, with 8.1, you have to fight the yes/no rng, plus the extra dozens of potential items you don't want from mobs you werent focusing.</div></div><hr />

Not every single item, drops are still connected to the mobs type present on the island. You just dont have to kill them anymore.<br />

Yeah run around island to find specific type of mobs, where is strategy here? And gl doing that when two other people are not interested in it. For me big QoL change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coconut</div><div class="date">2018-12-03, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In Tides of Vengeance, all players on an Expedition will have a chance to receive cosmetic rewards based on the island’s inhabitants, rather than which enemies were specifically defeated.

<br />
This seems worse, unless the actual drop rates are also increased. It's not clear if a triggered invasion adds those mobs to the list of &quot;inhabitants&quot; (technically the inhabitants are the mobs spawned at the start). If it doesn't, you won't be able to farm a certain reward unless the associated mobs happen to be part of the weekly island rotation.<br />
<br />
The simple, obvious solution was to further increase drop rates and to make invasions spawn earlier so we can actually farm them properly in Heroic and Mythic. With these changes, the loot system would have actually been fun. I don't understand why they felt the need to go this route (easier to implement, maybe?)<br />
<br />
<br />
So if anyone in the group earned some Azerite from killing invaders or mining Azerite near the invaders, everyone in the group had a chance at the cosmetic rewards.<br />
<br />
I suppose &quot;mining&quot; means opening invasion-specific chests, otherwise I call BS. My early tests with a mining-only strategy (back when the aggro reduction item was available) consistently triggered only azerite-related loot. Basic chests also dropped rep items, never rewards related to nearby mobs.</div></div><hr />

Except the fundamental premise of island expeditions is literally &quot;gogogogo&quot; so this is a super weird gripe.<br />
<br />

You don't even realize the inherent contradiction of saying &quot;every single item can drop&quot; and &quot;you'll never get your last mount&quot; do you?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Exactly. With this change, everyone will be there to do the same thing - beat the island as fast as possible, which is literally what the game tells you to do.<br />
<br />

<br />
This is a simple solution but certainly not a good one because it just doubles down on playing islands in a way different than what was intended. <br />
<br />
Why they went this way is clear as day to understand and is right there in the Blizzard writeup you are responding to - they want people to play islands they way they were intended and eliminate friction between players since not everyone was on the same page of how to play them (which is what happens when the game tells you to do X but hidden mechanics encourage you to do Y).<br />
<br />
A loot system like what was in place could be great, but it should be in a section of the game that encourages that play style.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it doesn't. The frictions were largely caused by invasions spawning so late that you had to babysit your azerite bar to avoid finishing the expedition too soon. Some people wanted to rush and others to wait. If they make invasions spawn earlier, you will always encounter one regardless of your speed, and you would likely kill those mobs because the rares and chests are great sources of azerite. On top of it, a further drop rare increase would alleviate the stress related to the grind, making it less frustrating for the players to miss out on a few rares they need it on any particular run.<br />
<br />
Besides, the whole divergence idea is overblown. Only morons and misinformed people actively try to miss out on loot. Leveling on expeditions is slower than questing, and the gold you can make from selling mogs and pets is great enough to be worth a minute or two targeting specific monsters. If you don't like it, you can always look for someone like-minded in the group finder, it only takes 2 other people...</div></div><hr />

The game literally tells you that islands are a race to get more azerite than the other faction. <br />
<br />
It doesn't tell you &quot;farm these mobs to get cosmetics&quot;. It doesn't tell you &quot;focus on specific mobs to get specific things&quot;. None of that. It tells you to get azerite faster than the other guys. <br />
<br />
And until players started experimenting, all Blizzard really told us was &quot;oh and you can get some cool stuff when you do islands&quot;.<br />
<br />
So yeah it's flat out divergence. You can insult everyone that disagrees with you but it doesn't change facts.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Blizzard had a problem in communicating the loot rules, but sometimes it's fun to let players discover some things too. Imho, they should have clarified the exact details as soon as we had the system mostly figured out here and on reddit. But the problems you are raising, while technically correct, are only relevant because of low drop rates and late invasions.<br />
<br />
If they fixed those, people would naturally get loot and have the opportunity to observe how it works simply by doing the objective, with deviations being more or less meaningless on both sides. Ther biggest deviation currently is people doing the Azerite Elemental event instead of farming other mobs and waiting for invasion; replace that event with something more lucrative 90% of the time and the problem fixes itself.</div></div><hr />

I agree that its fun to let players discover things, but not when what you discover tells you &quot;you know how we told you to do the thing this way? well now you know you should be doing it this completely different way&quot;. The mechanics should at least be aligned to the point of the game mode. <br />
<br />
My issue with your recommendation is it doesn't really align the loot mechanics to the game mode, it adjusts other things to try to obfuscate it, and like you point out, it is not a clean fix. <br />
<br />
Move this loot mechanic elsewhere where it syncs with the goal of the game mode.</div></div><hr />

Your issue is a valid one, but I feel better drop rates would alleviate it. If the mounts are as rare as the one from Sha of Anger, sure, you'll be pissed that you wasted dozens of hours without knowing what to do. If the drop rates are high enough that you can target something and pull through the grind over a reset or two, it's not so bad anymore.</div></div><hr />

Well, female gamers caring doesn't suddenly invalidate the content, although I'm sure there are guys caring as well. Seen quite a few guys making Pet Battle strategy videos. <br />
<br />
I'm not here to coddle you about this, you either care or you don't but long-term collections are still an inherent part of MMORPGs. Plenty of people care, that is probably WHY there are pets and mounts and transmog items added so frequently. :). <br />

Pets and mounts, once the skeleton has been designed, are able to be scaled and mass-reproduced, so it's an economic use of in-game assets to re-skin a base skeleton and call it a new product. Sad that this is what we get now in the way of rewards instead of any form of meaningful character progression items/class sets etc. I guess this is what was meant by Activision telling Blizzard to cut costs :/<br />
<br />
Unique achievement mounts/boss mounts etc are fine, as they are a tangible reflection of dedication and determination</div></div><hr />

<br />
Given details that emerged recently regarding cost reduction, and the decision to homogenize armour and other rewards, it's either an amazing coincidence or it just may be that pets/mounts/things that have no bearing on gameplay whatsoever have been added on bulk because they are cheaper and quicker to churn out and a percentage of the playerbase will lap it up.<br />
<br />
Cosmetics, like tier sets and rare weapon xmogs from legacy raids, sure I see the value in that. As I see the value in mount runs. I do legion xmog runs myself because some of the tier sets looks awesome. <br />
<br />
Maybe people do care about them (pets). I guess the people I play with (guildies and friends) just don't see to care about them. I'd also be wary of what Blizzard say in regards to the content people do. Participation =/= compelling gameplay. Dangle a dopamine-stimulating carrot over something and people will do it. And I think that catering to a percentage of the player base that would favour collecting pets (homogeneous and cheap) over class-specific items/cosmetic rewards/something tangible is a bad long term strategy</div></div><hr />

I'll believe the facts, not rumors and speculation from people irrelevant to the game since over a decade now, thanks. If they revert to the design philosophies of WoD, there might be some weight to the &quot;cost reduction&quot;-hypothesis.<br />
<br />
The original question was &quot;who wants to collect pets??&quot;, and to that the answer is &quot;players&quot;. Again, since it seems a bit slow, what we see in-game and decisions made reflects player behaviour, NOT whatever is the current moronic meme spread by certain jaded individuals within the vocal minority that's active on forums.<br />

People use certain buzzphrases about the game in every.single.expansion. Legion and BfA are no different. Meanwhile, in-game... <br />

IMO the problem with IE was assigning an AP reward to it in the first place and putting a short timer on it when it's something that should have encouraged exploration. Instead of actually fixing what was wrong with IE's they've catered to the gogogo &quot;get it over with&quot; mindset that turns everything in the game into a chore that must be endured rather than an activity that is enjoyed.<br />

I wish instead they had just removed the weekly AP reward and basically lengthened the timer or gave easier ways to impede the AI from gaining Azerite too quickly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd dare say that the design philosophies behind core games systems (Classes, PVP, Itemisation) were FAR better in WoD than in BfA. The issue wasn't design (Garrison was shit tho), the issue was lack of content. And we will never really know what could have been because all resources were diverted to pumping out Legion (which, you could argue, had more content than even before) <br />
<br />
The answer would be 'some players'. But thankfully, those players that think pets are rewarding will be able to enjoy them on their mobile<br />

If they had just been clear about how the loot worked from the start, I feel like everyone would have been on board with their loot system. With this change, RNG still dictates what loot we receive, only now we have literally no agency concerning what loot we get, other than by winning the island. <br />
<br />
Again, if Blizz had been very clear and upfront about the initial loot design in islands, I think it would have been fine. But instead they complain about 'divergent player behavior' - well no shit, only a % of players know how the loot works, since Blizz intentionally obfuscated the system.</div></div><hr />

Yeah no shit, the connection here was that the decision to stop designing class-specific sets/xmog and replace it with generic plate/mail/leather/cloth etc and the boon in the number of re-skinned non-combat rewards (pets and mounts) coincides remarkably well with stories circulating about Blizzard being told to cut costs.<br />

I mean you might have had a point if they wernt adding new PvP gear not just recoloured raid sets, more leveling sets for both factions, more Warfront sets for both factions ect.

Well, one could also suggest that you're the selfish one for wanting everyone else to kill the mobs you want to kill instead of taking the most efficient route to complete the island in time.<br />

<br />
I don't care about achievement points either.<br />

WoW is just a boring collection game now...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boring is a matter of opinion. I was bored doing M Progression so I quit and I don't anymore. Now I mostly level alts and collect stuffs<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the change and clarification hidden Blizz employees</div></div><hr />

Never said I don't finish the expedition on time. I always plan on doing that. But one can do both at the same time. If running past a bunch of mobs that has a chance to drop a toy/ mount, you can target that mob and rare easily. It's about teamwork. Unfortunately not anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that's ok, we get battle pets instead!<br />
<br />
in legion we got sets redskin again and again in bfa we got sets split by horde and alliance that wernt just reskins for leveling, pvp, warfronts, raids, and were not just taking the same sets recolored again into the second raid and dungeons. Bfa has lets tier sets sure but it has more sets every where else.</div></div><hr />

The content is also mob/rare grinding in a scenario, which can be fine but it's quite tedious to repeat without a variety of events, so let's hope that's being worked on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Palemoon</div><div class="date">2018-12-04, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ooh I like this new change. Absolutely agree. Way too many groups did not care about the cosmetics or mounts. There is major selfishness in many players. They feel they don't need it, or already have it, and almost on PURPOSE avoid those specific inhabitants.<br />
<br />
If you're joining a group specifically created to farm rares for toys, then it is indeed selfish behavior.<br />
<br />
If you're using the random group finder, don't expect people to be there for anything but getting the island done as fast as possible in order to get their weekly cap. There's absolutely nothing selfish about that.</div></div><hr />

Collecting stuffs... I really don't get where the fun is in collecting things you'll never use. And paying a monthly sub for that.</div></div><hr />

Why wouldn't it be an improvement?<br />
<br />
Old system: Kill x mobs of type y to get your 5% drop chance for that category <br />
New system: Have mobs of type y on your island? 5% drop chance for that category<br />
<br />
With the chance increased by dificulty (and the 5% being a completely random number)</div></div><hr />

Because knowing blizzard they will set the current max threshold to mythic and lower chances on normal and heroic , mythic IE sucks ass making the farm 10x boring</div></div><hr />

Has WoW turned into a game for girls?<br />
<br />
It's ALWAYS been a game for girls. Guys play it too, of course :)<br />
<br />
Why do you think having fun things in a game makes it more for girls?</div></div><hr />

Except that wouldn't be how the new system works. <br />
<br />
Current: kill x mobs of type a for 5% chance of drop from type a's loot table.<br />
<br />
8.1: do whatthefuckever with no strategy involved to get 5% chance of a drop from types a through i.<br />
<br />
The new system, unless droprates and amount of drops allocated per run, dramatically reduces your chance of getting the transmog, mount, or pet you are trying to farm.</div></div><hr />
