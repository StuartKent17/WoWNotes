MMO-Champion is recruiting forum moderators! 
I am looking for moderators. A lot of moderators. If you check the forums regularly you probably saw a few change happens and more things are on my lists. 
 
That's why more moderators are needed, the forums aren't necessarily the happiest place on earth at the moment and the curent team of super-awesome moderators (who have to take care of 3 to 5000 posts each day) would be happy to have new friends.

MMO-Champion is recruiting forum moderators!<br />
I am looking for moderators. A lot of moderators. If you check the forums regularly you probably saw a few change happens and more things are on my lists.<br />
<br />
That's why more moderators are needed, the forums aren't necessarily the happiest place on earth at the moment and the curent team of super-awesome moderators (who have to take care of 3 to 5000 posts each day) would be happy to have new friends. <br />
<br />
Are you interested? Please <br />
send me a mail (boubouille@mmo-champion.com?subject=[Moderator] Your-Username-Goes-Here) (and only a mail, no private messages) with the following details :<br />
<br />
Your account name on the forums. Please use [Moderator] &quot;Username&quot; for the title of your mail.<br />
Real life info. (Age / Location mostly, we don't need to know much more than that) <br />
A few words on why you want to be a moderator.<br />
The name of the forum you want to moderate. (Up to 2 forums, you will only be recruited for one and the 2nd choice will be used if we have too many applications for the first one) <br />
<br />
Important - You cannot apply if you registered less than a month ago or if you have less than 100 posts on the forums. I might accept people who have slightly less than that if they look like awesome potential moderators but your post history is the only thing we can use to make a decision. <br />
<br />
<br />
Crimson Halls Hotfixes<br />
Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game. Keep in mind that some of these changes may not be active until after the realm has been restarted.<br />

Skipping to the last boss in Heroics<br />
While there may be some instances in which you can do this manually, our intention wasn't to make this an exceedingly quick way to get two Emblems of Frost. This is more of a method to encourage players to participate in the Looking for Group system and help those who are playing through the dungeons get ready for the epic encounters that await them in our currently available raid content. Thus, implementing a &quot;skip to the finale boss&quot; mechanism would be counter to those goals. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22748775436-let-us-skip-to-last-boss-in-heroic-please.html))<br />
<br />
Resilience Boost Hotfix<br />
We don't want resilience per se to bring with it the &quot;kiss / curse&quot; of also nerfing your own healing output or heals received. We want players to like resilience on PvP gear. It shouldn't be a hard decision. We'd prefer a model where resilience improves your survivability without any real downside.<br />
<br />
If we implement a healing change, it would be temporary because health pools will be larger in Cataclysm, proportionate to healing, so we don't think that will be a problem. Burst damage may be less of a problem too for the same reason, but we're less confident of that. If it isn't a problem, then we can change the resilience scaling again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22748774679-resilience-requires-additional-alterations.html))<br />
<br />
Rated Battlegrounds<br />
We have announced our plans to add a rating system to the Battlegrounds to bring back much better rewards and premade teams for Cataclysm. This is a system that has been under development for quite some time, and development will continue on it until we get it right. Adding this type of system into the game isn't trivial. We want to make sure Battlegrounds provide new levels of competition, properly measure success, and adequately award players according to their performance.<br />
<br />
We'll be sharing more about this system as we get further along in development of the next expansion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22748815416-pvp-is-dying-alive-do-you-even-care.html))<br />

Blood Queen Lana'thel Videos<br />
The first video of Blood Queen Lana'thel I posted wasn't complete and some people couldn't see it because of the restrictions on copyrighted music. Here is a new one! <br />

<br />
Another video was also released, this one explains an ... interesting way to complete the encounter in 10-man. It doesn't really use any bug so let's just call it clever use of game mechanics.<br />

I really try to optimistic with the changes blizz makes but this really is like handing tokens over to players. More so than before. Think of all that time wasted on creating the instances. Also how new players will never have to learn encounters (if they choose to) which will probably help them learn and be more familiar with more important raid encounters.</div></div><hr />

the point is heroics are very stale content after 14 months of doing them. it's all very well to want to complete them if you haven't done each one 50 times, but being forced to do them for 2 badges is lame.<br />

People like you are what is wrong with this game. By your logic, raiding the same instance over and over again for a few months gets boring, so they should just have a box of loot at the beginning to save you the trouble. <br />
<br />
You are rewarded emblems for doing the heroics, no one is forcing you to farm emblems, nor are they forcing you to do a heroic.</div></div><hr />

I try and do between 5-10 randoms a day. Yes, it does get &quot;stale&quot; and repetitive, but that still no excuse to just skip everything. If people think it's to boring, do something else. Besides, if you want to experience the higher tier content start raiding or set up an arena team. If your guild isn't doing any of those, change guild. Hell, change server for that matter. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
&quot;A hotfix was deployed earlier today that increased the duration of Essence of the Blood Queen from 60 seconds in 10 player mode to 75 seconds and (from) 50 seconds in 25 player mode to 60 seconds.&quot;<br />
<br />
Basically the hotfix was done specifically to counter the letting someone die on purpose strategy outlined in this 10-man video and also used by many groups in 25-man (1-2-4-3 (death/res)-6-12-24 instead of 1-2-4-8-16-32(MC wipe)). Now that it lasts 60 seconds instead of 50 in 25-man and 75 instead of 60 in 10-man, the hard enrage lines up with the soft enrage of having people get mind controlled due to lack of people left to bite, WITHOUT having to let someone die to line the enrages up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The news content is great, regularly updated and flawless.<br />
<br />
The comments from users and created threads usually lack any real substance. Threads such as &quot;worst reason you got kicked from a group&quot;, &quot;Blizz need to put in IQ test&quot;, &quot;EU &gt; US&quot;, &quot;lol wow is easy and boring&quot;... just make me want to facepalm. Obviously in a social environment your going to have to accept comments from these parasites but I would love if there was a function to ignore certain users. <br />
<br />
Maybe we can do some kind of study here but do other people start reading comments on youtube, mmo, just general forums and just think &quot;why am i reading this crap?&quot; when you realise just how unworthy some individuals are?<br />
<br />
Also I think you need to reorganise the forum categories. It doesn't make sense to have seperate WoW forums for Original, TBC and WoTLK. Maybe just make a general WoW forum and the cataclysm for unreleased content. Edit: Didn't realise you did that recently.<br />
<br />

Isn't there a forum where your post should be placed?<br />
<br />
Yes, &quot;certain&quot; users are like you say. But considering all the people who actually make quality posts etc. it's not that bad. Also, just to remind you, this is &quot;the internet&quot;, it brings out the worst in everyone. :D<br />
<br />
P.S. Not everyone has the latest expansion, and not everyone wants to read about someones question about Wailing Caverns when they want the latest on ICC. :P So, separating them into different sections is actually a smart move. ;)</div></div><hr />

No one is forcing you to run the heroics for the 2 Emblems of Frost. Blizzard put it there as a way to help those that don't raid to aquire Frost Emblem Gear. If they wanted to, they could require you to run 5 heroics before awarding the two Emblems of Frost. Given the current system, it is rather rewarding to the non-raider.<br />
<br />
Though, it's my belief that those that don't raid have no use for raid gear, but thats neither here nor there.<br />
<br />
Back to the issue though. As I already said, no one is forcing you to run them, so why complain about it? Don't like it, don't run it.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. We wiped at least twice sub 5% due to MCs the other day. Managing MCs was the only difficult part of the fight, if that's removed the DPS check will easily be obtained by most guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The news content is great, regularly updated and flawless.<br />
<br />
The comments from users and created threads usually lack any real substance. Threads such as &quot;worst reason you got kicked from a group&quot;, &quot;Blizz need to put in IQ test&quot;, &quot;EU &gt; US&quot;, &quot;lol wow is easy and boring&quot;... just make me want to facepalm. Obviously in a social environment your going to have to accept comments from these parasites but I would love if there was a function to ignore certain users. <br />
<br />
Maybe we can do some kind of study here but do other people start reading comments on youtube, mmo, just general forums and just think &quot;why am i reading this crap?&quot; when you realise just how unworthy some individuals are?<br />
<br />
Also I think you need to reorganise the forum categories. It doesn't make sense to have seperate WoW forums for Original, TBC and WoTLK. Maybe just make a general WoW forum and the cataclysm for unreleased content. Edit: Didn't realise you did that recently.<br />
<br />
<br />
This would be better if you sent it through a pm to Boubouille. Not sure if he'll actually see this request. Though, most times, an ignore feature on a forum has always been related through pm's, not threads or individual posts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That bug makes me sad.... Yet another fight where I can't use my deviate fish, and I'm stuck being a hideous Draenei :(.<br />
<br />
<br />

The MC gimmick is supposed to make the fight difficult as it acts as a soft enrage timer. I'm hoping that Blizzard doesn't do anything to reduce the difficulty. I want to see truly difficult end wing Boss fights, even if I cannot participate in them myself.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but doing dailies for gold or rep or whatever (example AT) is also stale once you are on your umpfteenth alt. Blizz still doesn't mail you gold for free.<br />
<br />
...and ICC bosses dropping 3 emblems is a good idea if you get into every single raid, but if you have a guild with 35 ppl and some need to sit out, at least you can get your emblems outside the raid too....</div></div><hr />

Not really. The fight's just generally doable now without having people suicide or overly stacking ranged classes. i.e. the DPS requirement is about the same, there just won't be extra planning/micromanagement involved.</div></div><hr />

I really try to optimistic with the changes blizz makes but this really is like handing tokens over to players. More so than before. Think of all that time wasted on creating the instances. Also how new players will never have to learn encounters (if they choose to) which will probably help them learn and be more familiar with more important raid encounters. <br />

No, not failure in a negative sense, and I apologize for the confusion. More of a sense that I should post a bit more often to add to the amount of knowledge on this site.

Back to the issue though. As I already said, no one is forcing you to run them, so why complain about it? Don't like it, don't run it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Completely disagree. You never needed emblems for tier gear before. They were strictly to catch players up to the previous tier so that they can run the newest dungeon, i.e. they give you tier 5 equivalent loot so you can start doing tier 6 dungeons. You get a token/gear drop, your raid assigns it to somebody, that somebody gets the gear.<br />
<br />
Blizzard added emblem requirements for 25-man tier gear for ToC. They bumped up those requirements massively for ICC. The chest/helm/legs, for example, went from 60 tokens to 95 tokens. They also slowed down the opening of ICC. For the first month, you can get a maximum of 8 tokens per week on 10-man and 25-man, 5 tokens for the weekly and 14 tokens for the random dungeon. New wings are slowly opening, but the people who did everything can get all their emblems in roughly 2 months while those who chose not to do the random dungeon will get theirs a month later.<br />
<br />
Technically, no one is forcing anyone to do anything. This is a game, after all. But in the context of the game, this is as close as &quot;forcing&quot; as you can get. Blizzard essentially told people that they either do random dungeons daily or be forced to get their tier armor much slower than in any previous tier and much slower than everybody else doing random dungeons. Of course, as Ghostcrawler mentions frequently, players are notorious for doing &quot;unfun&quot; things so they can progress the fastest. <br />
<br />
Their reasoning in that thread that they want more experienced players to help newer players. That reasoning is a complete failure, however, because the mere presence of an overgeared raider running it for his 2 emblems makes the newer players learn nothing at all. <br />
<br />
Take a look at Moorabi, for example. Theoretically, the more experienced players will teach the newer players about counterspelling/kicking/interrupting rotations. However, the experienced players will kill him so fast, he'll only have 1-2 tries to transform. Not to mention geared players can easily get healed through. Or Keristrasza. No need to learn biting cold as a geared healer can heal noobs through it and just 1 geared dps can kill her fast enough for intense cold not to stack too high.</div></div><hr />

... hilarious how most raiders seem to whine about how the bosses in WOTLK are so boring and easy compared to vanilla, yet they try everything out on PTR, they read through guides or abilities of the bosses before trying them on live servers and then on top of it all seem to try to find bugs or other unintensionally ways to &quot;defeat&quot; the bosses, like letting members of your raid die so the fight becomes easier. ???</div></div><hr />

So you had the choice of trying to bite someone while you are supposed to be spread out killing 2 people or spread out and be mc'd. This longer buff will eliminate this hopefully. They just blamed strats rather than their own mistake of allowing this above scenario play out.</div></div><hr />
