Alterac Valley imbalance<br />
We have discussed this numerous times. Based on the data we've collected over the years after all of the changes that have been made to Alterac Valley, we simply do not agree that there are any glaring imbalances in the map favoring one side over the other enough to easily sway a match one way or the other. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425771701-blizzard-doesnt-care.html))<br />
<br />
Masteries Cap<br />
It's possible you will only get the benefit of the tree in which you've spent the most points, or will only get the benefit from say 50 points maximum with the bonus chosen from the tree with the most points in it. We'll have to see when the talent trees are more finalized and we start to figure out build strategies.<br />
<br />
Overall, the goal is to spend points as you want, and not feel penalized for spending into another tree or feel like you have to game things by spending more points than you want in your tree. Remember these passive bonuses are designed to give you flexibility, not lock you into anything. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/29/23614404862-mastery-system-preview.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Imagine you spend 55 points in Retribution, so you get the maximum passive talent tree bonuses from that tree. Your remaining points you can spend where you want, in Retribution, Protection or Holy. It does discourage some kind of true hybrid build where you go partway down multiple trees, but we aren't really trying to support those, and they aren't very popular today.<br />
<br />
The flexibility comes (hopefully) in having more discretionary points that you can spend on talents you like, rather than sacrificing raw damage, healing or tanking to do so. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/29/23614404862-mastery-system-preview.html))<br />
<br />
Mastery/Talent system and new players<br />
It's designed partially with new players in mind. It will be much harder to have a truly terrible talent spec because you won't be able to help but be reasonably good at your chosen role.<br />
<br />
The mastery stat itself won't show up until high level, and even when it does, you should have more confidence that it's a stat you want instead of say trying to figure out the percent of your damage that is physical damage to calculate if armor pen is good for you or not.<br />
<br />
I admit that adding passive bonuses at all to talent trees complicates the talent feature slightly. We hope to make up for that by there being less paranoia about picking &quot;the wrong&quot; spec. The wrong spec might only be a slight loss instead of a tragic loss. As a point of comparison, dual-spec complicates talents a little, but overall we think it was good for the game. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/29/23614404862-mastery-system-preview.html))<br />
<br />
Mastery bonus distribution<br />
To answer your question -- and this applies to all classes. the first two mastery stats are gained by placing points into a given talent tree (and wearing the gear intended for your class, e.g. leather for druids). This will allow us to remove many of the talents that always felt mandatory, especially at the min-max level, and allow room for customization.<br />
<br />
When we begin revealing specific class information, (such as new spells and abilities, and the talent tree revamp) -- the posts we've made thus far, will make much more sense. I feel, players should look at the stat/system changes, as well as this mastery post as a &quot;piece of a puzzle&quot; -- and ask questions, provide feedback, but understand that until more information is released, it's not possible to see the whole of the picture. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/29/23614404862-mastery-system-preview.html))<br />
<br />
Masteries Q&amp;A<br />
# 1. 28/28/20 spec. Does mastery on gear affect both highest trees or give no benefit at all?<br />
Mastery on gear gives you one bonus. That bonus is the third passive (the unique one) in the tree in which you’ve spent the most points. In the examples we gave, those are Absorption, Radiance and Runic Power generation. <br />
<br />
# 2. How are ferals and Dks as tanks working with mastery system in place? Are they to care about it for threat or do they have separate bonuses.<br />
Ferals will have passive bonuses that say Cat: melee damage done, Bear: damage reduction. For death knights we have a different plan in mind that we’re not quite ready to discuss. DKs are undergoing some slight changes so they aren’t so GCD constrained and are less limited by rune cooldowns. <br />
<br />
# 3. How are the non-pure classes going to be balanced against those with a full 76 point passive benefit? Balance, enhancement(not so much), shadow, feral, ele, resto, holy and Ret all have this issue. <br />
Assume you only get the passive bonuses for the tree in which you’ve spent the most points, and there is a ceiling per tree (which could be something like 51-55 talent points). If you spend more points than that in a tree you still get the benefits of the talent. If you spend points in another tree, you are benefiting from those talents instead. Unless you try to make say a 40 / 36 / 0 build, you shouldn’t be losing passive bonuses. <br />
<br />
If you turn level 10 and spend 1 point in Discipline, you are now a Disc priest. You receive the Disc talent tree passive bonuses and mastery rating on gear benefits your Disc passive bonus (Absorption). If you reach level 85 and have 70 points in Disc and 6 in Holy, you are still a Disc priest and the same rules apply. If you change your build to 51 Disc / 20 Holy / 5 Shadow, you are still a Disc priest. <br />
<br />
# 4. Hybrids who use spells not improved by their spec on occasion such as heals or the extra lava burst are feeling that their non-specced spells are going to be extremely weak as compared to now.<br />
They are weak now and the intent is to keep them that way. We aren’t trying to nerf them any more than they are today. If we want to make sure Resto shaman can do big Lava Bursts, we’ll give them a talent or something to make that happen. We don’t want Resto shaman to Lava Burst anywhere on the scale of an Elemental shaman. Again, how they perform today is pretty much the target for where we want to end up. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-death-knight/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Runic Power boost through Frost masteries<br />
I know it's hard to get a feel for the design when you can't see the complete picture, but talent trees are changing for Cataclysm. As Eyonix referenced above, we are changing the DK rune mechanic a little so that you aren't so GCD constrained. This in turn will give us a chance to rebalance how much runic power Frost gets. Remember that in many cases we are pulling talents out of the trees and giving them to you as passive bonuses. In general if you see a passive talent tree bonus and think to yourself &quot;Hmm, that doesn't sound very good for me,&quot; then it's probably because we haven't revealed the changes that lead to that being attractive to you.

Shockwave vs. Thunder Clap<br />
Shockwave is technically a ranged attack, like a hunter shot. This means it's treated like an attack (and not a spell) for purposes of what you want but can't be dodged or parried. (I believe ranged attacks can be blocked, but I can't honestly remember off the top of my head.) The Shockwave treatment might be the right way to go for Thunder Clap. Thunder Clap is currently a spell that hits for physical damage and can't be dispelled. The distinction among spell, melee and ranged attack (or persistent auras like Consecrate) is a largely technical one that doesn't always encompass unusual abilities well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425709868-warriors-arent-designed-to-scale.html))<br />
<br />
Thunder Clap in 3.3.3<br />
I think we're likely to make Thunder Clap a ranged attack (like Shockwave) for 3.3.3. This will let it get 200% crits among other things.<br />
<br />
Standard no promises, in case there ends up being a problem with that implementation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425709868-warriors-arent-designed-to-scale.html))<br />
<br />
Also, a few people asked for the visuals of the Masteries system released during Blizzcon. I'll post them again here but keep in mind that these pictures are already 6 months old and most of the information here is probably outdated. <br />

<br />
The argument over faction balance in AV has for the most part been fixed I have felt. My gaping problem I always see with AV is the lack of PvP that actually goes on. It is a 40 vs 40 battleground and I find myself fighting NPC's more than actual players. How often does the horde and alliance just run past each other in the field of strife doing /wave.<br />
<br />
The 10 hour long AV's of yesteryear are not something that I want back but the pvp and effort it took to win was nice. When was the last time an AV lasted enough to see armor upgrades done or god forbid a Monster was summoned in the field of strife. AV is one of the most dynamic and event based battleground to date yet it has become a 3 minute rush to Vann/Drek.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as AV goes, I do see the bridge offering more ally protection than the horde wooden wall. However, it should be noted that ever battlegroup I have played on horde wins every battleground consistantly, except AV. Ally have to have something to make their epeen grow. Using AB as an example, horde can get to both LM and BS faster than ally can. Even if ally has a DK who turns on Path of Frost to run over the lake, to reach BS, horde still reaches the flag before ally does. Guess strategic disadvantages makes the game more fun.</div></div><hr />

Every tree that you put points into will give you mastery; but the tree that has the most points in it (that 51st point being in an integral talent) will define the mastery bonus that you get.<br />
<br />
I really want to have more flexibility in building my character spec rather than looking at what is optimal within a handful of situational points. The way that the talents trees are moving seems only positive. But if they give us too many additional skills and spells, how will we find room for the buttons on our bars?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give me a f...... break, you'd have to be either completely braindead or playing Alliance to find Alterac Valley either remotely balanced. The reason Horde does ok is because we work for it, and adapt. Alliance can just sit back, and wait for the zerg, and they still get more honor that we do, its pathetic.</div></div><hr />

Aside from getting instagibbed by Korrak, I actually liked the 12 hour AVs more. With most of the honor gain coming from kills anyway, it didn't matter if you couldn't be there the whole time, and it had a much more epic feel. Now if a tower is attacked nobody cares because the game will be over in a few minutes anyway. Back then if a tower fell it would be gone all day, costing you valuable NPC reinforcements and seriously hurting your side's defenses.<br />
<br />
I had times when I joined a game in the morning, then had to leave and came back to the same game still going on in the afternoon. Truly epic, and while the games were slow it felt like the things you did there actually made a difference to the ongoing battle.</div></div><hr />

I've always related TC an aoe attack, like Arcane Explosion, while SW was more of a frontal attack, like Cleave or Cone of Cold.<br />
So is the proposed change to make TC attack like SW already does? A frontal attack and just call it a &quot;ranged&quot; attack? And what does the crit have to do with it?<br />

Either way, I've always wished that SW would work like TC does, an aoe attack, because I have charging in, hitting TC, then repositioning trash to make sure mobs are in front of me, and THEN using SW to maximize it's effectiveness. Now it's the other way around -_-</div></div><hr />

I've always related TC an aoe attack, like Arcane Explosion, while SW was more of a frontal attack, like Cleave or Cone of Cold.<br />
So is the proposed change to make TC attack like SW already does? A frontal attack and just call it a &quot;ranged&quot; attack? And what does the crit have to do with it?<br />

<br />
<br />
It's nothing like that. <br />
<br />
TC is considered a &quot;Spell&quot; not a &quot;melee&quot; or &quot;ranged attack&quot; and therefore the crit coefficient is only 150% ie frostbolt before talents only crits for 150% They propose to change it to a &quot;ranged attack&quot; so that it will crit for 200% by default before impale and thus = slightly more AoE threat for warriors. It won't change the functionality assuming there's no bugs, but it will do more damage. Which is win.</div></div><hr />

The AoE portion of TC and Cone portion of SW will stay the same. They are just making TC Physical attack. Physical attacks crit for 200% of the damage, while spells crit for 150% of the damage. Right now, TC is a spell, thus it crits for 150% of its damage.<br />

With most of the honor gain coming from kills anyway, it didn't matter if you couldn't be there the whole time, and it had a much more epic feel. Now if a tower is attacked nobody cares because the game will be over in a few minutes anyway. Back then if a tower fell it would be gone all day, costing you valuable NPC reinforcements and seriously hurting your side's defenses.<br />
<br />
I had times when I joined a game in the morning, then had to leave and came back to the same game still going on in the afternoon. Truly epic, and while the games were slow it felt like the things you did there actually made a difference to the ongoing battle.<br />
This + you had the feeling you where really on the battlefield fighting the enemy. It felt epic back then now it just feels like an empty place :(. /qq</div></div><hr />

Your bit encapsulated in quotes is exactly the point. They won't have to go eff up the talent trees to fix classes that are overpowered due to unforeseen circumstances. If a spec gets out of line they can just tweak the mastery stats and nobody has to go respec. It's called effective design.<br />

I didn't play in vanilla but I Heard a lot of QQ how faster AV is nowadays, heard people in guild how much fun it was with 5 hours each battly, saw some SS, etc...<br />
<br />
<br />
well back in the day the towers had elite guarding them + the archers, there were also wandering elites on the map which give honor if you killed, for example there was a Abomination who was on the horde side etc.<br />
<br />
Also players could collect stuff from bodies of players and use them to summon a boss, summon a bat or a gryphon to attack players from air, plus also a whole lot of npc attacking on mounts and on feet. These things really gave teams boost in their offense. <br />

Those two could be healed by their faction<br />
<br />
&quot;In Patch 1.11, the number of NPCs was severely reduced. On some servers, this has led to a strategy that is known as &quot;the race&quot; or &quot;the zerg&quot;. In this strategy, both sides bypass the main enemy group and rush the graveyard nearest the enemy base, quickly clear the two bunkers in the base, pull the Marshals, and then pull the General. Each side may also kill the opposing captain and claim a mine or easy Graveyard on the way, but the goal is still to rush the General without directly engaging players of the opposing faction. This leads to a faster-paced game which can be easily won or easily lost, providing more honor and AV tokens per hour than protracted games with the same win rate.&quot; http://www.wowwiki.com/Alterac_Valley</div></div><hr />

My gaping problem I always see with AV is the lack of PvP that actually goes on. It is a 40 vs 40 battleground and I find myself fighting NPC's more than actual players. How often does the horde and alliance just run past each other in the field of strife doing /wave.<br />
<br />
The 10 hour long AV's of yesteryear are not something that I want back but the pvp and effort it took to win was nice. When was the last time an AV lasted enough to see armor upgrades done or god forbid a Monster was summoned in the field of strife. AV is one of the most dynamic and event based battleground to date yet it has become a 3 minute rush to Vann/Drek.<br />

<br />
Indeed. They should just overpower the adds and maybe the BG boss too so you can't win without destroying the towers first. At least 3 towers destroyed should be the requirement.<br />

That takes at least 10 secs on towers, and 1 min or so before we can engage the boss. Thats a lot of time in a rush to the end. they need to play their game some more.</div></div><hr />

What's there to not get? As you spend points in a single talent tree, you get 1, 2 or 3 bonusses. De third bonus will always read as something like:<br />
&quot;Increases [insert type] damage by [y]&quot;, or &quot;Decreases damage taken by [y]&quot;.<br />

<br />
For example grabbing a tower as alliance is simple, you just run up and get it. As horde you need to kill 2 guards and then stand exactly right so you don't get hit by the rest. When both teams are rushing this is extremely important. (And at low levels it's extremely frustrating since all the mobs in AV haven't been adjusted for the new level brackets and the introduction of battleground levelling (50-59, level 55/60 mobs for example))<br />
<br />
Then you have an elite at the south (or north?) DB bunker, that aggro's when you enter it. While the alliance have one non-elite to worry about that will evade before you're even at the FW towers.<br />
<br />
Those two are easy things to fix, put the guards behind the beams in the bunkers and remove the elite or move it to a place it won't aggro at all.<br />
The map itself isn't as bad as people make it out to be tbh. Alliance have the bridge, while horde have the nice narrow hallway with lots of corners. Both can be avoided, but most will just go through the maze like a rat and get trapped.</div></div><hr />

For me it's not wanting the exact same AV back as it was prenerfs with the red/orange dude and all. But those things made it epic. If they only altered it into a more challenging BG where you have to use those 'tools' in order to win the battle. It would be alot more enjoyable then it is now. These days everyone is stressy about getting as much marks the fastest and they start to QQ if it isn't going fast enough and try to get people to lose. I really hope that stops with 3.3.3 :). It's not about running in circles it's about an exiting battle.</div></div><hr />

It's been explained a dozen times.<br />
<br />
The mastery STAT on gear, will increase the third mastery BONUS.<br />
<br />
For example: Disc priests third mastery bonus is X% more absorbtion on shields.<br />
<br />
Mastery STAT on gear will increase X based on the amount of mastery on the gear.</div></div><hr />

Please read.<br />
<br />
Every spec will have a unique Mastery Bonus for their third mastery.<br />
<br />
They will never let Paladins have a 100% cooldown on any ability, the mastery stat probably has pretty high diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />

So you spend your 51 points in the Disc tree as a priest. Because you are wearing cloth armor (like you have a choice) and you spent your &quot;max&quot; points in the tree, you have a third level Mastery bonus of (let's say) +3% absorption to your shields. You pick up a piece of gear with +20 Mastery on it. Now your third level bonus is +3.2% absorption. (Note: these numbers are completely and totally made up. They simply demonstrate the concept)</div></div><hr />

The really nice thing about it (from my point of view, and one of things I think Blizzard likes) is it gives them a stat they can put on gear that people will always like. Right now, let's say there's a phys DPS ring. It has ArP on it. The Combat Rogues go &quot;Oooh, nom!&quot;, the Marks Hunters go &quot;Not bad!&quot;, the rest of the Phys DPS specs go &quot;Dammit Blizzard, ArP sucks!&quot;. Now they put Mastery on the ring. Suddenly everyone likes the ring. Whatever you, personally, like for your class/spec, this stat gives you more of. Unless they screw up and give a class useless or underpowered Mastery bonuses (which they can fix relatively easily) it's stat that will always be good for everybody.</div></div><hr />

With that removed it would be great if blizz restores it to it's former glory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I think that would be great - but I cant see it happening. I also cant see the majority of the player base even wanting it (which I think is a mistake). Ill explain....<br />
<br />
Ive remember running heroics in BC, they required a little thought, and more time. There was more trash and some had to be CCd (at least till we outgeared them a lot). Some instances like heroic Shattered Halls had some nasty pulls that required everyone to be on their feet - and before pallys became so overpowered at the later part of that expansion - CC was a must for that place. Heroics took some time to complete.<br />
<br />
Now, just run a heroic.... How long is it taking you? 10, 15 mins? This is great for &quot;grinding badges&quot; but personally I think the game has suffered for this. People arent running the instance for the fun of it - its ONLY a grind for badges. Often times bosses are skipped and if they can go straight for the last boss then even better! On my newest toon I had to do Old Kingdom heroic about 5 times before I got the achievement for it - and even then only with a run with guildies. Everyone else had skipped most bosses.<br />
<br />
I think the same happens with PVP....... yes - people are farming marks to a degree so with those going it may help issues a little. However a lot of the honor still comes from killing drek or vann - and I suspect that even with marks going and kill honor going up etc, people will still zerg because they want to be out really fast.<br />
<br />
I dont know what the solution is - it never works to reset the clock - the days of fast battlegrounds and heroics is here - and I cant see it changing - even in cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 pence worth.</div></div><hr />

Runic Power boost through Frost masteries<br />
I know it's hard to get a feel for the design when you can't see the complete picture, but talent trees are changing for Cataclysm. As Eyonix referenced above, we are changing the DK rune mechanic a little so that you aren't so GCD constrained. This in turn will give us a chance to rebalance how much runic power Frost gets. Remember that in many cases we are pulling talents out of the trees and giving them to you as passive bonuses. In general if you see a passive talent tree bonus and think to yourself &quot;Hmm, that doesn't sound very good for me,&quot; then it's probably because we haven't revealed the changes that lead to that being attractive to you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23710210871-mastery-system-preview.html))<br />
<br />
I would love to see less dependencies on GCD. Also, the passive talents NEED to be out of the trees. Been saying this from the beginning of WotLK. Excited to try this stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
This sounds really interesting... Soon the DKs will be passive DPSs/tanks. (Aoutocasting bars! Yay!) Sounds Blizz wants to transform WoW into a Japanese Hack and Slash MMORPG...</div></div><hr />

It's designed partially with new players in mind. It will be much harder to have a truly terrible talent spec because you won't be able to help but be reasonably good at your chosen role.<br />

Making it impossible to be bad at something also makes it impossible to be good at it.<br />

Not necessarily. It'll still be possible to have a 'terrible' spec, just not a &quot;truly terrible&quot; one. I'd expect there to be a &quot;truly awesome&quot; spec as well (one where certain utilities can be used in combination for amazing dps boosts).</div></div><hr />

They are adding mastery for wearing the &quot;proper gear&quot; <br />

You also get a bonus for equipping the correct armor type.<br />

From what the Blue posts said:<br />

Equipping your correct armor type will boost the first two mastery bonuses.<br />

<br />
<br />
They actually answered this later in the same thread, you get the mastery bonus of the spec that you put the points into first. For example, you put 28 points into one spec and are now considered that spec until you put 29 points into another spec. They also added that they were not confident that this was the final solution.<br />
<br />
As for people confused as to how the mastery stat works: Mastery is now a stat on gear as well, such as haste or crit, which increases the effectiveness of third &quot;special&quot; bonus for your given talent tree. Another way to think about it is the bonus from every 10 points of &quot;Mastery Rating&quot; that you get from gear is roughly equivalent to the &quot;special&quot; bonus from adding another point into that talent tree. (Obviously made those numbers up though.) <br />
<br />
However, there is a cap on the bonus you can receive from talents, after 55 points in one tree additional points in that same tree stop giving you mastery bonuses. The only way to receive any additional benefits from mastery at this point is to get Mastery from your gear.<br />
<br />
The mastery you get from wearing your correct armor type is a bit different, it increases the first two bonuses from mastery. (The direct stat increasing ones.)<br />
<br />
Hope that clears things up, I tried to explain it in a few different ways in case you had trouble understanding any one of them.</div></div><hr />

We have discussed this numerous times. Based on the data we've collected over the years after all of the changes that have been made to Alterac Valley, we simply do not agree that there are any glaring imbalances in the map favoring one side over the other enough to easily sway a match one way or the other. (Source)&quot;<br />
<br />
Give me a f...... break, you'd have to be either completely braindead or playing Alliance to find Alterac Valley either remotely balanced. The reason Horde does ok is because we work for it, and adapt. Alliance can just sit back, and wait for the zerg, and they still get more honor that we do, its pathetic.<br />
<br />
<br />
This. This 100 times over.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shockwave is technically a ranged attack, like a hunter shot. This means it's treated like an attack (and not a spell) for purposes of what you want but can't be dodged or parried. (I believe ranged attacks can be blocked, but I can't honestly remember off the top of my head.) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

(Source)<br />
<br />
So they think alterac valley is ballanced, sure, boss wise, its quite ballanced, but when it comes to bunkers vs towers or capping the horde base, alliance definately has the upper hand.<br />
<br />
To those that doesn't know what I mean: <br />
<br />
Towers vs bunkers: Towers are much easier to cap due to not having to deal with bowmen whatsoever. <br />
<br />
Sure you can do the same in some bunkers, but not them all, and you do have to angle it a bit in most cases (not the worst problem).<br />
<br />
But when it comes to horde base, alliance can easily cap the gy in horde base, only having to deal with the guards around the flag, they take very little dmg to the bowmen when running in to the horde base due to the design / layout.<br />
<br />
When horde runs into alliance base, they take dmg from bowmen at both bunkers. Outside the south db bunker is an elite which you have to deal with before capping the bunker (if you are solo ofc). Also you do have to deal with atleast 1 bowman at this bunker to be able to cap it. (again if you are solo).<br />
<br />
now lets turn the focus towards the aid station flag. When you run towards that flag, you are likely to agro the 4 npc's standing at the forge or w/e it is. What im trying to say, horde has to deal with way more stuff when rushing to cap alliance base, than alliance has to deal with when capping the horde base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the same happens with PVP....... yes - people are farming marks to a degree so with those going it may help issues a little. However a lot of the honor still comes from killing drek or vann - and I suspect that even with marks going and kill honor going up etc, people will still zerg because they want to be out really fast.<br />
<br />
I dont know what the solution is - it never works to reset the clock - the days of fast battlegrounds and heroics is here - and I cant see it changing - even in cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 pence worth.<br />
Tbh I don't mind a 15 - 30 min BG run. But ignoring most of the BG's mechanics and the constant QQing (ironicly I'm QQing about QQing :-X) completely took the fun out of AV (and most other BG's). can't wait for rated BG's and only get serious players on your side.</div></div><hr />

Give the guy a break, he's got a lot on his plate. Whether or not he remembered how block does or does not interact with a ranged physical attack seems like a fairly minor point to get worked up over.</div></div><hr />

Arathi Basin is fair as an Alliance .... but you just get about 10 retards all fighting to take the stables and 5 players who actually look to run to GM LM or BS</div></div><hr />

But on the paladin screenshot, in the prot tree, it shows &quot;Damage Taken +3%&quot;... I REALLY hope this is some kind of mistake and they meant &quot;Damage Taken -3%&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I never experienced pre-bc AV, but heard about it. I just missed getting to 52 before BC came out. I loved AV before the re-enforcements change. Now, I take premades into AV with the soul purpose of turtling. Stopping the horde rush, and killing the alliance rush do to the numbers not being high enough because my group is sitting on defense. We even take the time to try and summon the Boss, and wing commanders as well, just for the fun of it. The rush makes AV my least favorite BG to pug now. By far. It's a BG for PvP, and all it is now is a PvE Boss zerg rush. It's sad.</div></div><hr />
