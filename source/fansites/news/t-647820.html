Blue posts<br />
Mana regeneration in Ulduar<br />
In my response I was trying to say that we did nerf mana regen, but perhaps not enough. We’re okay with that for now though because the design of the Ulduar encounters had lead to more variety in healing than just constantly spamming your big spells. You still do that sometimes, which is totally fine.<br />
<br />
As someone above pointed out, mana is more pressing on the hard modes particularly while you’re still learning them. That will improve a little over time as you gear up. We’ll see how things feel then. [...] It may be slightly OP, particularly once everyone is in full Ulduar gear. We’re not going to announce a nerf in the next few weeks or anything (barring something unforeseen). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16904263407-a-question-about-healing-direction.html))<br />
<br />
Healing on Mimiron<br />
Mimiron is not an easy fight for anyone and I totally agree it is challenging to heal. It’s kind of at the extreme edge of “You must heal everyone NOW NOW NOW” though. I’m not saying many healers are snoozing through Mimiron. I was saying that even though mana regen can still be high, the regen doesn’t let you overwhelm the content like you could in Naxx… at least not in current gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16904263407-a-question-about-healing-direction.html))<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration out of combat<br />
Regen is definitely lower in combat. I’m not sure it’s as binary as constrained vs. non-constrained. Totally agree about your point at large though. One way to go would be to just get rid of the FSR and make out of combat regen (legitimately out of combat – not sneaking a sip during an Arena match) provide very fast regen.

Exorcism working on pets<br />
We change our minds all the time. If we didn't, then interacting with the community would be of much less limited value. My original comments ended up spurring a lot of discussion in the community and in the office and we became convinced that the ability was just really one-sided especially against hunters and locks. Remember, it did not used to get the auto crit. We don’t mind abilities that counter other player’s abilities, but there needs to be some back and forth involved.

Elemental Shaman<br />
As I posted in the other active thread on this topic, we still cannot find any bugs with Elemental. We looked at a lot of numbers from before and after 3.1 and (except for the lower crit values) the numbers don't seem very different. It could be that other classes, notably rogues and Feral druids, just improved.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, we do think Elemental is a little low so there is likely to be a small buff coming. I feel obligated to add the standard no promises caveat. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474242555-whats-going-on-with-elemental-shaman-dmg-.html))<br />

Potential changes to Juggernaut<br />
The charge in combat is the key part of the ability and not something we are liable to mess with. Lowering the crit chance would be an option. So would be messing with the glyph of charge. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904204830-simple-questions-regarding-balance-direction.html))<br />

MMO-Champion now on Steam!<br />
In the next few days/weeks I'll try to spend more time improving the community side of MMO-Champion. Recruitment for new moderators will be open very soon and you can probably start working on your applications, some of the forums will be merged / re-ordered, and I will try to spread MMO-Champion to a few extra places. <br />
<br />
We'll start with an easy one today: the MMO-Champion Steam Community (http://steamcommunity.com/groups/mmo-champion). I think that most of us spend some time on other games and it could be nice to see familiar faces here, depending on how popular the group is I wouldn't mind getting a few dedicated servers for our favorite games (Left 4 Dead and Team Fortress 2?). <br />
<br />

YAY. I could maybe understand allowing Exorcism on 1 target that Pallies have the hardest time killing. But why the hell would you allow it on only the WEAKEST targets in arena?? This ability definitely needs to become PVE only again.<br />

They have less mobility. Pallies and DK's can miss and be parried or dodged as well, flawed argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right... Warriors are just like Paladins and DK's, just with alot less defense... That's why warriors suddenly began to rock the high ratings with 3.1 and DK's felt down hard...<br />

Any spell past 15 minutes can't be used in arena, including paladin lay on hands and divine intervention. Druid rebirth, warlock curse of doom, etc. Those dont count as pve only, they count as OP pve abilities that cant be arena cuz arena resets cooldowns between matches, so a warlock summoning a doomguard every match would suck.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mana Regen 2nd Nerf - This is bullshit. They already nerfed Mp5 from spirit by 40%. This is the first time I went OOM in a raid in a long time. Being a priest in Ulduar blows now. Seeing how most fights are healing prominent because Blizz likes to make everyone in the raid take damage. I'm already gemmed for mana regeneration but now it just seems like a big waste.<br />
<br />
Warrior Juggernaut nerf - Bullshit. Warriors yes can put out a great deal of damage but their defense is incredibly limited. That's why they always need a healer in 95% of most arena comps. Nerfing this would put warriors back in the place they had in Season 5. Might as well as go back to Fury guys.</div></div><hr />
