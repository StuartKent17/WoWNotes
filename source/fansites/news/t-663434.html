What is this, the front page of worldofwarcraft.com? Sure you get the Mighty Mugg looking thing and an authenticator but weren't tickets like $25 more this year? <br />

Man I remember one year I went to Heroes Con (yearly comic convention in Charlotte, North Carolina) and was kind of hungry and went to get some nachos and they wanted $5 for a piddly little thing of them. $3.50 for a coke. WTF! I just waited out and went to Jack in the Box with my friends afterward. I want to spend my money buying stuff, not food. :P</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is hand sanitizer. We had it in the goodie bags from last year as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not Positive but i think there is more swag give out on the actual day of Blizzcon but i can't really remember<br />
<br />

If they follow suit from last year, everything is already in the bag except maybe some flyers/handouts/booklets.</div></div><hr />

I mean, a map of the convention, some generic hand sanitizer and a ton of advertising. Buy a stein! Buy a murloc! Buy a new mouse! Buy some new t-shirts! Buy a new laptop! What is this, the front page of worldofwarcraft.com? Sure you get the Mighty Mugg looking thing and an authenticator but weren't tickets like $25 more this year? <br />
<br />
Edit* Oh and the $40 Murloc pet<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure a couple of those advertisments contained a special code to get a discount on the items. But yea, too many advertisments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hah, last year had quite the make-shift line for getting your goody bags / badges for getting in. I dubbed it the &quot;AV Queue line.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that hand sanitizer? What the heck?<br />
<br />
They gave it out last year. Hygiene is ftw :P.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The food vendor is a rip off, $3.00 bottled beverage?<br />
<br />
Should make the fresh fruit only $1.00, make some incentive. :P<br />
<br />
<br />
The food inside is just as expensive too :(.<br />

<br />

Nope. It doesn't even look like there's a beta code either as last year's card has two sets of instructions (one for the mount, one for the code). I was thinking about ebaying a goody bag if it had some nifty stuff in it, but now I might just buy one of those weird looking Starcraft Space Marines (if they're like the swords and paladin balls from last year, they can be purchased from the store).</div></div><hr />

The pet is better since it goes to all your characters on a battle.net account, but other than the action figure there isn't anything really cool. While last years items weren't all useful (StarCraft arm bands and Zerg creep) there were lots of cool little things. No beta code is troubling, unless they are just being sneaky and attaching it to the pet.<br />

Hope the rest of the convention makes up for it.</div></div><hr />

I'd have to agree. Last years was much better. Had a few more things like the D3 Stress Balls, Sweat Bands, Pandaren Brewmaster Bottle Opener, mini Frostmourne keychain (almost surprised I got through the airport with that thing these days), and D3 cinnamon mints.

Taking care of your body is normal and there is no excuse for being obese (except maybe if you got some genetic defect).<br />
<br />
Damn they validate every cliché about the 'cartman like wow player'.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that you in those pictures? Is a family member? A friend? Chances are no it isn't. Some people choose to live life the way they want regardless of the outcome. I say let them be and not judge or comment on the way they choose to live.</div></div><hr />

a game convention so who cares? ;P<br />
<br />
<br />
I had to look at the pictures again and I'm shocked at the number of fat people as well. I'm afraid to admit I'm used to seeing that, but I can't give any other explanation as to why I didn't notice it at first.</div></div><hr />

Though I do agree with you 100% that you should live how ever you wish, doesn't change the fact that there are reasonable ways of living. If people want to live unhealthy so be it, as long as they are happy.</div></div><hr />

Wrong, eating less is unhealthy. Eating ENOUGH is healthy, thought this isn't a topic to be talking about over a game forum about upcoming AWESOMENESS! <br />

Me. Real Life was always about looks and always will be. The very vast majority of the people that state &quot;i dont care about looks only character matters&quot; plain out lie.<br />
<br />
Oh, and dont blame it on some disease or genetic defect, its plain and simple most (not all) people just do no sports and eat the wrong food. Well at least i must not care, i live in germany some years to go until i run into mass of fattys on the streets here. Gaming is no excuse for bad healthcare and hopefully never will be!<br />

The bag itself is kinda dissapointing. Only two &quot;usefull&quot; things the Figurine and the authenticator. Well maybe the parfume or lube or whatever mit be fun for a day. No Mount no Special Pet (TV Stream), i guess it sucks.<br />
<br />
A german Gamersite (readmore.de) announched yesterday the postponing of Stracraft II for several years, mabye thats why there is no Betakey. Cause there will be no Public Beta for a long time.<br />

Uh I guess the pet is also included in the bag, because that was the actual reason why the provide the stream - so everyone can get the pet (and yeah..watch the con while all information will be spread around the net 30 minutes later)<br />

You can say this but the world does not.<br />
<br />
Count all people in the Media, the politics and the economy. Than look up how many are overweight and how many are not. Than subtract the one that make jokes of themself beeing overweight. Your percentage number will be rather low.<br />
<br />
And no people can not always do what they want. If they could Law would be not necessary but infact it is.<br />
<br />
If overweight tends to become a healthcare problem and because of this becoming a problem for the economie of a country and the all of the people than sir you should think about being so fcking selfish to belive you can do whatever you like.<br />
<br />
As you can see there are many sides of beein overweight. The one is aesthetic the other one is healthcare costs. Of course the aesthetic one is up to you, but i think more people like normalweight people. The last one isnt up to you anymore, if you like it or not.<br />

You sire fail in at understanding that society needs law and to obey it. You are selfish and ignorant at best, even if you think of yourself as &quot;better&quot;.<br />

Well, as you can not judge for looks, deeds or thoughts you can not judge at all. Which makes you a person with no opinion at all, which makes you mentaly ill i guess. <br />

Yes very overpriced fruit. However the seller clearly has failed to do any market research. His market there doesn't strike me as the sort that are the fresh fruit types. My best is that he sells out of everything bar the fresh fruit quite quickly. ;D ;D</div></div><hr />

If someone close to me makes really poor choices I will tell him about it and I will offer him help, and not because I'm someone that likes to stick his nose in others business but because I care. And someone thats obese is slowly destroying himself (obesity and everything that comes with it is the number one cause of disease and death in western societies).

<br />
That's how long you have to wait if you got the pet via the stream.<br />
<br />

World of Warcraft in-game pet codes will be mailed out 6 to 8 weeks after the event along with redemption instructions. As a reminder, the pet is not redeemable is all regions (see the FAQ for details), and a Battle.net account is required for redemption.</div></div><hr />

Well i guess than we can move to Godwin's law or somthing related.<br />
<br />
Attack at 9.11.2001. Well they decided to fly a plane into a building. Let them.<br />
WWI WWII etc. Mass genocide and nuclear bombing. Well if they like, go ahead.<br />
<br />
You sire fail in at understanding that society needs law and to obey it. You are selfish and ignorant at best, even if you think of yourself as &quot;better&quot;.<br />
<br />
I guess you never judge people cause you can not. Why? You just said it.<br />
<br />
Well, as you can not judge for looks, deeds or thoughts you can not judge at all. Which makes you a person with no opinion at all, which makes you mentaly ill i guess. <br />
<br />
Sir get a psychiatrist to get you into society again.<br />
<br />
Two quick things:<br />
I'm not a sir or a sire.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, I don't have an opinion now because I choose to not judge people and I'm somehow mentally ill as well? Also, no where in any of my post did I claim that I was better than anyone else nor do I think that I am. I'm not saying people don't need laws. I do believe the last time I checked (I could be wrong here) but it's not against the law to be overweight? You see this discussion could go on for hours/days/weeks. My question really is why must people point out the flaws in others? Do you do it to make yourself feel better? Do you do it because you think its OK to talk about the way people look? Do you point out mentally handicapped people? Do you make fun of someone because of race? Etc and so on... I just see things from a different perspective than about 90% of people. I've had this discussion before many many many times over. I just don't understand how its reasonable to point out the flaws in the way people look.</div></div><hr />

Back on topic : Very jealous, as I'd love to go to Blizzcon. However, I'd probably crumble to dust in the queue outside! Does seem like it'd be one amazing event, and I'm looking forward to the information. A GM asked me last night if I was excited :D<br />

I know, i wrote about illness that causes overweight and that its sad and you should not joke about it.<br />

As you envy the people on blizzcon, can i assume you get depressions (which in my opinion is no unavoidable illness like a genetic defect) and will start eating right now and become a fatty? That would indeed make me smile a bit.<br />

What a retard company, if ppl stays in line for hours to get tickets and goodies it would be 1 big plus for company if they get free cold drinks.<br />
For all of this years i can say biggest minus for Blizzard is their marketing strategy.<br />
When you have good base of fans and loyal customers, best strategy for company is with small and for customer free activities work more on company image and &quot;goodwill&quot; which will lead to easier and eficient penetration of their new products, i feel sry for Blizzard cause they ppl in marketing department work awfull.<br />

If you are fat, it's your own damn fault. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Here we go fellas:<br />
<br />
Obesity-related genes could affect how we metabolise food or store fat. They could also affect our behaviour, making us inclined towards lifestyle choices that increase our risk of being obese:<br />
<br />
* Some genes may control appetite, making us less able to sense when we are full.<br />
* Some genes may make us more responsive to the taste, smell or sight of food.<br />
* Some genes may affect our sense of taste, giving us preferences for high fat foods, or putting us off healthy foods.<br />
* Some genes may make us less likely to engage in physical activity.<br />
<br />
People with obesity-related genes are not destined to be obese. But they will have a higher risk of obesity. In the modern environment, they may need to work harder than others to maintain a healthy body weight by making long-term, sustained lifestyle changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bag looks not that cool at this moment.<br />
But since ppl can pickup stuff after the openingceremony i am sure there will be information in the complimentary Blizzcon program that blizz does not want us to know yet.<br />
I am so hoping that it will be the announcement of the new expansion for WoW.<br />
But i think that Blizz got us all by the *youknowwhere* and will announce something completely different.<br />
My guess it will be the new MMO they are working on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it's true what I just posted. Obesity is not a permament disease. You can get rid of it so it's your decision to stay fat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maneken</div><div class="date">2009-08-21, 11:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGXCRhHeUgk<br />
If you are fat, it's your own damn fault. <br />
<br />
<br />
First, if some is overweight its 3 part problem: 1) gens 2)sort of food which you eat 3) lack of activness 4) Culture and social envoirement of country you live<br />
So, plz dont generalize problem.<br />
<br />

Same here...I can eat whatever I want and as much as I want, I just don't gain weight. I m not totally skinny, but I m a bit below average weight. It's probably like this because of genes ( fast digestion ).<br />

Fast digestion causes your body to digest food quickly, but you won't get as much nutrient as people with slower digestion.</div></div><hr />

I was at the WWI last year in Paris and this is very true. There simply weren't that many overweight people at that event compared to these few pictures. European food is ofcourse very different from US food, everyone already knows about this. This has nothing to do with the wow comunity in general, it's visible everywhere you are when you compare US vs EU. But it's their country not mine and they should do as they please. <br />
<br />
But enough of this, that sword is awesome indeed ;D</div></div><hr />

Edit:<br />

I m not totally skinny, but I m a bit below average weight. It's probably like this because of genes ( fast digestion ).<br />
<br />
Fast digestion causes your body to digest food quickly, but you won't get as much nutrient as people with slower digestion.It has to do with your metabolism. Don't take it for granted though. It can change as you get older and you'd gain more weight than what you used to from what you eat.</div></div><hr />

Indeed how about people learn to control their intake of food. I mean surely you might notice something is amiss when you are downing your third liter of coke and that 5th whole chicken and then pondering what you shall have for main course.<br />
<br />
I get the whole &quot;oh my genes make me do it&quot; theory, what a classic that is. But sometimes can't help to think a good old fashioned whip might get some of these fatties in shape.<br />

Spend 30 minutes a day excersizing and away from the computer and i can guarantee you wouldn't be fat. Lay off the soda, beer, sugary drinks/energy drinks and you wouldn't be fat. Most people are making the valid observation that damn there are a lot of chunky people in thiose photos and i bet 99.9% of them are chunjky because they're letting their personal life and hygene go to hell to libve in a phntasy mmo. Don't blame everyone else for your own problems with reality there buddy. People aren't meant to be 220 lbs at 19 years old as most of those ckids look Add another 10 years of piss poor nutrition and bad excersize (or none at all) and you got the worlds largest generaztion xyz with heart disesase and probably diabetes in that one pc alone.</div></div><hr />

Man, I wish I could be there. I'm a sucker for the atmosphere of any nerd convention I can attend (though I haven't been to many, considering my financial situation). Looking forward to news on all of Blizzard's big franchise titles, although I have to say I'd like to hear information about a new game. It's been quite some time since Bliz hit the market with something fresh, and Blizzcon would be a great place for such an announcement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realize of course that you and every other person who feels the need to post on how fat &quot;everyone&quot; is in the pictures are pretty much the classic net self loather.<br />
<br />
In case you're not quite quick enough to pick up on what I'm saying I'll spell it out for you: Until I see a picture of you holding a sign that says &quot;This is for MMO-Champ&quot; in my mind you are a 400 pound behemoth who isn't at blizzcon because you can't fit on an international flight from your supposed super healthy country to here.<br />
<br />
I lived in Germany for 8 years in the early 90s for the military. There are LOADS of overweight people there. Pretty much the same anywhere in the world where you can get your hands on a limitless supply of food. And here's a pro-tip for everyone: People who are really really in shape don't post about it on a wow forum. <br />
<br />
30 minutes of exercise might make sure you don't have a gut but its my guess that most of you are the classic &quot;Skinny fat&quot;. 160-190 pounds with 13-15% body fat. No definition, but looks &quot;OK&quot; in a t-shirt. Seem pretty close to the mark? I thought so.<br />
<br />
Now before anyone thinks I'm trying to defend the obesity crisis I'm not. Most folks in this country could stand to lose weight. Period, New paragraph. <br />
<br />
But all of you sickly thin, no muscle mass having, greasy haired, holier then thou sticks managed to get on my nerves with 14 pages of &quot;OMG U R SO FAT!&quot;. Treat people with a little respect and see if you don't get a better result then a whip (as one idiot suggested). <br />
<br />
Also you may be interested to learn that larger people don't tend to eat much more then skinny people. 5 chickens and 3 liters of coke is a popular media myth but the fact is all it takes is exceeding your Kcal limit by 500 or so a day to get into that type of shape. Try to help people up instead of pushing them down.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't change the fact that you're not on topic.<br />
<br />
By comparison, the goody bag may be smaller than last year, but considering the announcements that could be coming, along with lots of potential mid-con swag, and the fact that you aren't paying for the bag itself, it looks pretty awesome. Also, to someone who will probably never see a Blizzcon goody bag, it looks even more swank to me. If I could actually manage to GO to Blizzcon, I'd be satisfied with a bag that just had a card in it that says &quot;You're at Blizzcon! Isn't that awesome!? Here's a nice bag for holding things!&quot;</div></div><hr />

If you do not judge people by any means you can not make up any opinion about them. Well you could do it randomly but this would by far make you insane.<br />
In between the lines.<br />
<br />
Free will. You just said you dont judge people depending on their behaviour. Let me than say what i want cause its my decission to do so, and concerning the comments in this thread many people somehow agree with the average ideal of beauty.<br />
<br />
<br />
You read the lines 100% wrong. I form plenty of opinions about people based on what they like/dislike etc. Based on the opinion you've form of me there's no way I could have friends or a normal relationship with anyone. You then would be wrong. There happens to be a lot more to people than just a &quot;Pretty Face&quot;. A lot of the comments in this thread are just trolls. You can assume they all agree with you and that's fine. I'm not judging you on why you choose to comment on people apperance its more of me asking why that's a reasonable thing to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
Genetic defects, race, gender and many other thinks are predefined. We can not choose them willingly, i would refrain from insulting someone because of this matter.<br />
<br />
But, if you eat and get fat, get used to get bullied. Your choise. Your consequense. The vast majority of fat People are not fat because they are all ill, its because they decided it. As you say free will. Live with the consequense.<br />
Right, As I said before you have choices in life and they are 100% your choice. If people choose to be overweight then who am I to cast judgment on them? Why would I want to? Mainstream Media tells me this is unattractive and wrong and you should look like &quot;insert whatever/whoever is popular&quot;. Society tells me its wrong to look different, or think differently. This is who I am. I'm not your average everyday normal person. If that makes me mentally ill/insane then so be it.</div></div><hr />

Then again, trying to track any of this stuff has the same requirement. I guess I'll just wait until the evening.<br />

I really hope that Bou's information was accurate about an Xpac announcement and its contents. It's not so much that I'm craving the official word and maybe some more info (I am, but it's not that). I'm just afraid that, if Bou were wrong, the Paris vid would become the next goatse/rick-roll link, and someone would eventually trick me into clicking on it. There are plenty of things I don't want to see on this internet. I don't need more.<br />
<br />
Wait a minute. That fruit cart reminded me... I haven't eaten yet! Yay, an excuse not to sleep!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheMediator</div><div class="date">2009-08-21, 03:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alright, let's just step aside for one second and say... why would anyone CHOOSE to be fat over not being fat? Seems to me to be an issue of do I want to be healthy, or am I not going to attempt to be healthy, not an issue of do I want to be healthy, or do I want to choose to be fat. Don't call it a choice when it really comes down to someone not doing something they should be doing. And its not hard to exercise anyways, the reason you hear all these fat jokes is because those people don't understand that the 50g they make from an hour of farming is NOT more worthwhile then spending that hour in a gym. <br />
<br />
Anyways... I can't wait to hear about some blizzcon shit. Details about Cata PLUX!</div></div><hr />

If people choose to be overweight then who am I to cast judgment on them? Why would I want to?<br />
<br />
Because i can.<br />
<br />
Same logic as to say they are overweight because they want to. Let them. As long as you let me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mainstream Media tells me this is unattractive and wrong and you should look like &quot;insert whatever/whoever is popular&quot;. Society tells me its wrong to look different, or think differently. This is who I am. I'm not your average everyday normal person. If that makes me mentally ill/insane then so be it.<br />
<br />
No it makes you a Nerd. In fact by definition.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tichrom</div><div class="date">2009-08-21, 03:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've wanted to go to Blizzcon, but I'm not on the internet enough to buy the tickets before the sell out, which I am assuming is the same day that they are for sale. I was planning to attempt a trip within the next couple years, and I have to ask these questions:<br />
<br />
*About how much does it usually cost for 3 tickets to Blizzcon?<br />
*Is it always at the same place?<br />
*How long is the convention usually going on in one day?<br />
*Do prices on flight tickets increase around the time of Blizzcon?<br />
*Is Blizzcon worth the money you spend to go?<br />
*Will I be able to go without fear of being judged in any way?<br />
*Are the tickets always sold on the WoW site?<br />
*About what time in the year are tickets put up for sale?<br />
<br />
Please answer if you can, I might be back later with more.</div></div><hr />

Look in a mirror. Realize that the hatred you spew here is directed at yourself. No one will ever love you until you can get past that.</div></div><hr />
