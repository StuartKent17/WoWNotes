Patch 8.2 PTR - War Campaign Scenario &quot;Stay of Execution&quot;<br />
The war campaign continues on the 8.2 PTR. It has both factions take part in a scenario to rescue Baine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alliance<br />
<br />
As of now, the first quest, Payment in Kind, starts from Jaina in Nazjatar. She tells you that Anduin has requested your presence. Upon arriving at the Stormwind Keep with Jaina and Shaw, you are informed that they have discovered that Baine is to be executed. Jaina volunteers to lead a small group to save him from where he is being held underneath Orgrimmar.<br />
You then speak to Jaina to start the &quot;Stay of Execution&quot; scenario. She ports you in right on top of a small romantic picnic set up. As you walk forward, you find out that the picnic was meant as a surprise from one female off-duty mech jockey goblin to another. Shaw unlocks the gate just as they arrive, and Jaina freezes them. Poor ladies!<br />
As you move forward, you are attacked by a few goblin azerite researchers. Jaina notices that they seem to be developing Azerite weapons down here.<br />
You fight your way through some unpaid interns and destroy some goblin mechs. Jaina and Shaw discuss how the goblins should be using their technology to develop ways to save the world instead of destroy it. You eventually reach another gate.<br />
Here, you and Jaina fend off waves of Forsaken guards as Shaw deals with the lock. He takes longer than usual, and Jaina suggests that she try a spell, but he says it will not be needed as the gate isn't much of a challenge compared to Rastakhan's treasury. You fight an elite goblin mech, Unit One-Thirty-Seven, who taunts Jaina by saying, &quot;Beware, beware this, toots&quot; before attacking you.<br />
You then stumble upon none other than Thrall and Saurfang, who are also there to rescue Baine. The group agrees to work together, but don't have much trust between them.<br />
<br />
Horde<br />
<br />
You receive the quest Visions of Danger from Lor'themar in Nazjatar. Lor'themar informs you that Spiritwalker Ussoh had a vision he wishes to share with you. Upon speaking to him, you are infromed that he saw Baine imprisoned and his life flickered out by the warchief before the next sunrise. <br />
Lor'themar says this must be stopped. He says he has followed Sylvanas for a long time, but can not allow her to execute Baine. He sends you to speak with old allies that he contacted, Saurfang and Thrall. <br />
<br />
If you sided with Saurfang, you arrive in Orgrimmar to find them talking with Rokhan and agree to help.<br />
If you sided with Sylvanas, you have the option to inform Nathanos of Lor'themar's treachery. He tells you to play along and you head to Saurfang and Thrall to help.<br />
<br />
Inside, you sneak past Forsaken guards with the help of a totem given to Thrall by Rokhan. Thrall and Saurfang then have you provide a distraction seeing as how you are still a hero of the Horde. <br />
The totem's magic runs out and so you must approach Dark Ranger Lyana, request a duel, and then inspect the troops nearby. After, you reconvene with Thrall and Saurfang and find the Alliance is also here to rescue Baine. The two groups agree to work together.<br />
<br />
Both Factions<br />
<br />
At this point, the events play out the same regardless of faction.<br />
You fight your way through more dark rangers and Forsaken guards, eventually dealing with an orc wolf trainer, Rowa Bloodstrike, before reaching Baine. It is here that there is a cutscene to reveal that this is a trap.<br />
The Sunreaver Magister Hathorel stops the group from freeing him by having his elite mages channel barriers on wards around the room. Shaw works on Baine's lock while you take care of two Dark Rangers, Thanel and Zanra. You then take on a Dark Warden Lyani Shadestalker.<br />
After the enemies are dealth with, Jaina uses her frost magic to remove the barriers from the mages around the room, allowing your team to kill them and destroy the wards one by one. When all are defeated, Magister Hathorel attacks. He ice blocks when he is near death, and the group teleports out with Baine.<br />
<br />
As Alliance, you are taken back to your camp in Nazjatar where Jaina discusses what transpired with Greymane. He is a little reluctant to work with the Horde after all they have done, but Jaina convinces him that they need to redirect their efforts against Azshara instead of the Horde which may buy time for Saurfang's rebellion to take root.<br />
As Horde, you return to Lor'themar in Nazjatar. He is surprised that the Alliance helped out, and Thalyssra reminds him that not long ago the two factions worked together to help her in Suramar. She then suggests that they redirect their focus to Azshara instead of the Alliance, a plan that Lor'themar agrees with, especially because it will anger Nathanos. He recalls back to the events of Pandaria in which Taran Zhu told him and Jaina that it stops when you turn from one another and walk away.<br />
<br />
If you sided with Sylvanas, you can then speak to Nathanos, who informs you that it was part of the plan to let them escape. He returns to Orgrimmar after stating that your loyalty will soon have a greater test.<br />
<br />

Guess we can take that silly notion that canon wise, only Horde helped out in Suramar away for good. And she says factions, not class halls. Obviously this was obvious for most of us.<br />
<br />
Good changes for the Crucible. As a small raid group that raids heroic with 10-12 people this is a decent change. Raid-scaling overall isn't stellar as it favors larger raids the most.</div></div><hr />

I hope she continues to. At this point I want her to do as much damage as possible since it's clear that Blizzard doesn't care about doing something that isn't what already happened, my only solace is that she takes as much from the Alliance as possible and a few shitty Horde characters along too. <br />

I can't wait to see the next list of layoffs. Really hoping some devs and Steve Danuser make that list. Danuser being in charge of the narrative is no different then Rian Johnson and the last jedi.

<br />
As Alliance, are we really supposed to just forgive the horde for all the atrocities they've committed during this expansion. Including &quot;Lady&quot; Liadrin, who is a paladin, yes technically a blood knight but still, when she slaughters wounded defenseless alliance soldiers and the priest just trying to heal them.<br />
<br />
Thalyssras lines are so hypocritical it's not even funny. Yes both factions helped us but we decided to pick ONE and essentially be at war with the other...<br />
<br />
The lines between Jaina and Greymane are so laughable. Jaina is so quick to change sides again. Only took half an expansion. How many times have we heard that before; &quot;If the horde doesn't hold up their end of the bargain then___&quot; They literally have NEVER held peace for longer than it takes me to eat a breakfast meal from Denny's.<br />
<br />
The horde is splintered and weak. Just run over them and let it sort it out. Not like they do anything anyways. Alliance did 90% of the work in Legion.</div></div><hr />

If you look at the sixth screenshot you can see they're both female Goblins but considering Goblin's naming conventions and their weird tastes as a whole race, Pookie and Honeybun could literally be their names and having a picnic in the Underhold fits as something Goblins would do to slack off of work. Though if they are a romantic couple, yes Jaina just iced some gal pals but this is Jaina &quot;DragonRider&quot; Proudmoore we're talking about here.

I have a question for you. While this story is retarded yes, why does this make you quit because of how dumb it is but something like The Burning Legion was fine? I mean to me the Legion was far and away the silliest and stupidest storyline in Warcraft lore. The Legion can destroy hundreds of thousands of worlds, travel the galaxies, their leader is literally planet sized, but somehow the primitive people of Azeroth manage to push them back what, 3 times? And then invade the Legions home base with almost no effort and then actually travel to other planets to push the Legion off of those as well. I mean, it’s completely and utterly ridiculous and stupid.</div></div><hr />

The Alliance v Horde story doesn't go back to it's roots at all. <br />

Sylvanas is just basically this &quot;empowered women&quot; rubbish that keeps getting pushed into media rather than actually developing an interesting female character. I mean shit they even said in an interview &quot;we will never see her in chains because she isn't like that&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for Old Gods. Who actually cares after what we've already seen of them in the past?<br />

This expac should’ve been all ally vs horde. Each their own raids, each taking land from one another, and id honestly wish they’d add to the old world than keep adding segregated pieces of land that are forgotten in a year. <br />
<br />
This expac should’ve had major heroes and villains dying, a complete shift in power for the horde and alliance, multiple lost capitals and huge chunks of land conquered by one side or the other with player involvement maybe swinging who wins or loses in the end. <br />
<br />
They lack the guts to make bfa s worthwhile memorable expac<br />
<br />
Edit: they should’ve made bfa the war to end all Warcraft wars and have it entirely be horde vs alliance</div></div><hr />

At least with GoT we are getting an ending period (looking at you deadwood for making me wait 10+ years) and even if its rushed, its because of a tv schedule and limited episodes due to budgetary reasons.<br />
<br />
WoW doesn't have those problems... it's problems are entirely self created. They had all the budget in the world for BFA and ended up making a soulless expac that appeals only to most casual wow players.<br />
<br />
GoT at least has to end because HBO is ending it and they don't have funding for 10-20 more episodes + spinoffs. BFA isn't ending WoW so no excuse there</div></div><hr />

Fair points and I can see what you are saying. Good input and I agree with you. The finite resources / time for GoT vs BfA is obvious, BfA ultimately had all the resources they wanted to craft a wonderful tale for all of us and they just chose not to. GoT ending - as you said - is by HBO and not the show trying to off itself. Either way, seeing it happen in realtime just does not sit well with me. Two beloved franchises spiraling out of control....:(. It's just obvious that the writing for both has taken a back seat for fanservice / glamour and money. Just sucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aside from Some of the winterfell moments, i don't think the writing is too bad in GoT the last 2 seasons... just really rushed which is understandable because they have to wrap it up.<br />
<br />
Not only because HBO is wrapping it up, but the actors/actresses have mostly all become rising stars and its harder to keep them together every year. Do i wish it was better and we had more tragedy? Of course i do, but it could be a hell of a lot worse.<br />
<br />
When Deadwood ended on a cliff hanger... i still haven't gotten an ending until the movie in a few weeks (10 years later) so having an imperfect, but not terrible ending to GoT is better than nothing. <br />
<br />
Other than The Wire; no show is perfect. Even the heralded Breaking bad, imho, fell off the last season for me. GoT is a lot more spectacle than nuance now for sure, but their on the clock so to speak and gotta wrap things up. HBO even gave them an extra year in between to help things out.<br />
<br />
BFA had funding, time, and everything they needed to be successful and nearly every idea they threw against the wall bounced back or were straight rejected. I wish WoW was in a better spot, but again it could be worse... at least i got classic soon</div></div><hr />

bc player think for some reason Warcraft Vanilla and Bc where good story.<br />
<br />
All the story from WOW have been stupid since day one, is a fantasy/sci-fi game at this point.<br />
<br />
There is 0 explanaition on the game why after so many year the Drenai dont have spash ships again or better technology that sword and shield. Since is clear they know this technologi, not only that most of the evils we have phase over the year have the power to overrun us, and bc some plot whole they just wait. <br />
<br />
Hell the lichking could have over run us during the questing on Wrath bc plot magic hold him. <br />
<br />
Ppl said now the story is bad but it been bad from the star, you love it or hate it but isnt GoT level of writing, is just a cheazy fantasy/sci-fy story.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell just for the power level some of the race control the war could have been over long time ago, from time magic from Nightborns, or the Space ship from Lightforge.</div></div><hr />

It's because they stopped caring about anything under 20 when they made mythic 20 only. Kind of like how they didn't care how many guilds they destroyed in the process</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda hard to believe there for both factions when the raised nightelfs willingly joined the forsaken ranks. Only to start killing there own race. Since Sylvannas doesn't have the lichkings power to control either. So the argument of mind control doesn't really make sense either. Lets also not forget the players raised them with help of the valkyr, while Sylvannas wasn't there. Zelling was raised and he never showed ill towards his living family. Danusers bad/crap writing.</div></div><hr />

No but this gives them a way to have both factions races as Dark Ranger.</div></div><hr />

Exactly how? The raised nightelves are hostile towards the alliance. As long as they are hostile, they won't be joining the alliance. Just because they have nightelves as darkrangers doesn't mean a thing. Players have been expecting a Tinkerer class but nothing has been shown. Same could be said about dark rangers. Which could have been introduced back in wotlk but weren't. The story would have made more sense then but not with current aspects at this point. Darkrangers in wotlk were raised highelves and could have sided with either faction. The difference between wotlk and BFA is that wotlk had the lichking/nerzuhl which controlled the raised/undead. BFA you got lame/bad writing that doesn't make any sense at all. So you have the narrative team trying to copy a past event but leaving out one key aspect of it. Nerzuhl/lichking and his power. Sylvannas doesn't have that, even the valkyr aren't at there full potential since they aren't linked to him anymore. So some how players are expected to believe in what the idiots on the narrative team say even if it doesn't make sense. Danuser is no different then Rian Johnson and the last jedi. <br />
Also keep in mind that Sylvannas wanted to attack Arthas even after he raised her. But she couldn't due to his power and control he had. Yet we see nightelves following Sylvannas and Nathanos without hesitation. She doesn't have the power that Arthas had. Yet we are suppose to believe that they willingly support Sylvannas even though she doesn't have the power that Arthas did. Follow there own killer.</div></div><hr />

Sylvanas is going neutral at the end of BFA so those who want to join her will, those who don't will have to go to one of the factions. That is how.</div></div><hr />

When they were introduced, Blood Elf Paladins were practically Lawful Evil; this would make Liadrin's actions merely be a return to form, were it not for the story writers' reticence to actually state it as such.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thalyssras lines are so hypocritical it's not even funny. Yes both factions helped us but we decided to pick ONE and essentially be at war with the other... <br />
<br />
There's also the whole Teldrassil thing to consider: Thalyssra quite eagerly joined in on the Horde's genocidal campaign against her Night-Elf cousins -- even after those same Night-Elves helped emancipate her people from Elisande -- and yet only now does she have the gall to speak of peace.<br />

While this story is retarded yes, why does this make you quit because of how dumb it is but something like The Burning Legion was fine? I mean to me the Legion was far and away the silliest and stupidest storyline in Warcraft lore. The Legion can destroy hundreds of thousands of worlds, travel the galaxies, their leader is literally planet sized, but somehow the primitive people of Azeroth manage to push them back what, 3 times? <br />

Tinker actually has in game mechanics and has been being tested in Island Expeditions. Dark Rangers are a slightly altered hunter that are 100% loyal to Sylvanas. There is literally no foundation for Dark Ranger becoming a class other than &quot;these exist in the story somewhere&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Its even more hilarious that said players are now looking at wanting all horde leaders to die, and in their very bubbled opinion, only see sylvanas as the only character that matters.<br />
<br />
This is whats known as a black hole sue, a character who the writer or fan wants to have all other characters bend to their will for their own personal satisfaction, having the world around them bend to it. And because it doesn't happen, said fans act out like irritated children.<br />

why ppl complain about the force narrative the game have???<br />
on WoW u never have a option on what to do on the story you are just part of it. Did you choose to remain loyal to the Lichking, did you have the power to not kick the sunreaver form Dalaran??<br />
<br />
WoW is doing what little it can to give player option on a system that never was desing for it. <br />
This inst SWTOR where u do a roll on a cinematic to see what will be the outcome.</div></div><hr />

Then they shouldn't have given us the option in the first place. Making a big fuzz about the decision only to basically ignore them in later patches is stupid. Don't they have a long-term plan for their writing?</div></div><hr />

I mean it would have been great if siding with her actually branched the story out. But it doesn't.<br />

Blizzard seriously need to stop being lazy with writing and just do a branching story where the decisions do have consequences.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Who else to side with? Prince Adam..ehm...Anduin? The girl that went all nazi in Dalaran(ah right, it's Jaina...and she was pissed...so it's okay)? There have been exactly three chars of interest(where I was looking forward to possible development within Horde and Alliance) before BfA. Sylvanas, Saurfang and Rexxar. Saurfang got ruined in BfA. Rexxar stays pretty much sidelined(what is wrong with that dude?). Sylvanas went down a pretty dark path but still she is at least somehow interesting...she is driving the story that is pretty much boring when it's not about her.<br />
Who should Horde players identifiy themselves with? Green Jesus that wasn't around for about 3 extensions? Cairne, Garrosh and Voljinn got axed...Baine and the other Horde leaders are about as boring as the alliance leaders...just with even less story to fill them up. They feel absolutely 1dimensional.<br />
<br />
It's not like people actually like what Sylvanas is doing. They just got no real choice. They blame the writers for f***ing the only remaining char up that was at least a bit cool and established...and stick with her. Can't blame them.</div></div><hr />
