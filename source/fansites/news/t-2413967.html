Duncan Jones - Behind the Scenes Warcraft Footage<br />
Duncan Jones recently uploaded a few videos on his twitter feed (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/media) showcasing a few sets that were created for the Warcraft film. One of the scenes below is actually the filming of a Troll invasion of Stormwind that did not make it into the final film.<br />
<br />

Boats and Portals on Map - Patch 8.0.1<br />
With the pre-expansion patch, hub maps now display a circular icon at locations for boats and portals. When you hover your cursor over these icons it will tell you the name of the location that the boat or portal leads to and the continent.<br />
<br />

Addon Spotlight - Personal Loot Helper BfA Changes<br />
Personal Loot Helper creator CardinalM1 (https://www.reddit.com/user/CardinalM1) recently shared a Reddit post (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/8z6qwm/personal_loot_helper_major_changes_for_bfa/) detailing all the changes that were made to the addon with the prepatch and beyond. For those who do not know, this addon has been used by many people to share personal loot that is upgrades to others and not to the one who receives the item initially. You can download the addon from the Twitch client or here (https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/personal-loot-helper). Here is a breakdown of what has changed!<br />
<br />
<br />
Updated UI<br />
Reduced sSocial pressure to trade away your personal loot<br />
The addon will no longer notify via chat that an item is an upgrade. <br />
The addon will not automatically whisper anyone.<br />
Coordinate Rolls mode has been removed.<br />
The option to display loot in raid frames has been removed.<br />
When you loot an item you will now have the option to &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;offer to group.&quot;<br />
If the user selects &quot;keep&quot; then the addon will not make any alerts.<br />
If the user selects &quot;offer to group&quot; then the addon will notify anyone using the addon that can use the item that it is available.<br />
Notified players can either pass or request the item for main spec, off spec or transmog.<br />
The addon does an internal /roll for each requestor and shows the looter each requestors’ reason for rolling, ilvl difference, and roll. The looter can then choose to keep the item for themselves after all or trade it to one of the requestors.<br />
Ultimately the decision is still up to the looter as the trade still has to happen manually.<br />
If a winner is made, the addon will alert the person to open a trade.<br />
The entire group does not see this going on, so social pressure is alleviated.<br />
<br />

<br />
His heart, the spirit, the feels were in the right place....he just did not know how to put it all together in a way that made sense or in a style that made sense.<br />
<br />
The sets were good, the visuals were spot on in terms of feel, just a lot of it was shot/lighted/post production done wrong. Not that everything needs to be gritty sandpapery mess like a DC movie....but put just a bit of a filter over some of the scenes to dirty it up just a tad would go a long ways. <br />
<br />
That said, if you read about what happened behind the scenes with the movie studio changing hands 3 times during the production of the movie and the talking heads in charge also shuffling several times, it is more understandable why the movie ended up as it did. The tone and structure of the movie felt very disjointed and broken.<br />
<br />
If they get a second crack at it sometime in the next 10 years, I actually hope he is involved in some way....as I think he provided some value to the project....but put someone in charge who knows how to do big movies and maybe understand it is OK to jump ahead in the story a bit to find a starting point where the story is frankly more interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seeing how passionate Duncan is about this project I feel his vision got trashed by all sorts of meddling from the studio, Blizz and what not. <br />
His heart was in the right place, but it was like making a painting and then some goons come around and start painting all sorts of crap on your canvas and you'll just have to make it work in one way or another.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumaras</div><div class="date">2018-07-23, 08:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've seen Duncan Jones do these or similar &quot;Making of Warcraft&quot; interviews where he's in a not-so-subtle way begging to get funding for another Warcraft movie. The odds of that are incredibly slim, and it's almost kind of getting desperate and sad.<br />
<br />
Although I saw it in the theater and enjoyed it for what it was at the time, I have to admit that watching it a couple more times after it released on video really started to show it's warts. That movie was what I feared would happen before release and often does happen with these types of fantasy movies. It's the problem that those types of movies take big budgets to make, and directors/producers always panic for fear that it won't have a wide enough appeal to make a profit. And in fairness to them they get enormous pressure from investors who worry about getting their money back. So they water the story down and end up putting out a movie that's not serious enough for hardcore fans, and too diluted to appeal to casual fans. In an attempt to appease the widest audience they end up appealing to the least. And that's exactly what happened with the Warcraft movie. <br />
<br />
I would 10x rather see a full-length CGI film in the vein of the Legion or BfA expansion videos. Obviously the pace would be slowed down for a 90-120 minute movie, but the quality of art, the dedication to the story in a Blizzard way, that would appeal to wow fans. Look at Clone Wars, it's about the art and the story...not an at least arguably hollow translation of the wow story into film like the Warcraft movie was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue wasn't Duncan Jones, the issue was the Hollywood Studio trying to direct what to do in the movie (Politics) <br />
<br />
I'm sure if Duncan Jones had free reign what to do with the movie, it would've been awesome. You can blame Universal Pictures if anything<br />
<br />
Hollywood Studios needs to keep hands off the movies, and stop making everything about Politics.</div></div><hr />

Just didn't even look interesting. I'm sat here with a week off work, never seen the fil and I'm not even interested in downloading it and watching it in all it's (lack) of glory. Cheap looking CGI puts me off. Look at the original Pacific Rim even now the CGI in that looks amazing with all the fights on land and at sea. Watched the trailer for the second one and just nope. Turned it off after half an hour when I did watch it.</div></div><hr />

Nonsense. The problem was the fact that they tried to tell two stories at once, which isn't a problem in itself. But the human story was terrible, overly cliché and had some of the worst acting known to man.</div></div><hr />

I also think they should have had Ruth Negga and Paula Patton switch roles. Paula butchered Garona. When I went to the movie I was walking out of the theater and people ahead of me knew nothing about WOW before the movie. They were saying they were pleasantly surprised at how much they liked it after reading the reviews. They were hoping for a sequel to see what happened to the baby. I think the movie would have gotten better box office if they hadn't let the critics review it before release.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fuhok</div><div class="date">2018-07-23, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My issue with the Warcraft movie is that I felt they tried to squeeze too much in to such a short amount of time. Could you imagine if LOTR was all three books in one movie? If they'd spread it out more, took much longer to tell the story over several movies, the entire thing could have been magnificent.</div></div><hr />

They should have done a one-sided movie with the orcs as evil invaders and just giving the audience a hint here and there that there is more to it that isn't revealed yet. Then 2 movies that show the other side(one about Arthas turning Lichking and where humans don't look all that nice)...one about the Horde, why they do what they do and what the Alliance did to them(possibly including short clips of the other side of the events of the first movie. For example the first movie could have ended with a huge battle Alliance vs. the Horde...and in the movie of the Horde you let 4 chars from different Horde races tell their racial story in a tent the evening before the huge battle...and end it with the same huge battle, this time with focus on heroic Horde actons during that battle). 4th one would then be about BC...by that time both sides would have had enough established characters(with different shades of grey) and you could work with alliances forming and breaking apart in the fight vs. the Lichking.<br />
I think horde players would not have had a problem with being bad guys in the first movie if they know that ut's going to change with the next movie. People know that complex stories need their time.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise it would've been a Human PoV of the first War.<br />
<br />
Even as a Horde player I would have preferred that all their time and resources went to the human side of things and keep the Orcs as villains only cutting to them to show the infighting and unrest. I came to see Fel crazed savages v.s. a well organized militia ending with the sacking of Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

This hasn't been my personal experience in either beta or live as an alliance player. I feel like I usually &quot;win&quot; most world encounters, unless they're rolling around in a huge gank-squad of 5+ players, in which case I've been able to successfully cobble together a group to fight them most times, or find good ways to fight back (like using the inns in Fallhaven to make a choke point).<br />
<br />
To note, I mostly play holy priest/holy paladin, and will often be in the world with my husband who mains ret, so I know that's a pretty slick world pvp combination. But even so, getting a group together has been easy, and getting a bounty on you is a huge target. It seems to go back and forth very frequently between factions in any zone, even when I was messing around with wpvp on my arc mage (beta). No one holds dominance for an unfair amount of time.</div></div><hr />

First, you're being perhaps overly dramatic. Second, four letters: EMFH before nerfs. Third, if Alliance opts out, this will not necessarily be a bad thing :D</div></div><hr />

Way to much CGI, and the parts of the sets that werent just blue screens, looked cheap and like some subpar sets you'd see at a theme park.<br />

Shame they couldn't have gotten Weta Workshop, aka the geniuses that produced the sets, special effects, etc. for the Lord of the Rings.</div></div><hr />

You cant argue that the sets weta made for LOTR look far superior to the ones made for warcraft. It may have been the art style chosen by the director, idk... but it looked like shit in general.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Less than Episode II: Attack of the Clones at least. I didn't think the acting was as bad as just the pacing and story they chose to tell, but that's a different discussion for other threads. I wouldn't expect Shakesperean acting from Warcraft. I pretty much thought everyone was serviceable but Ben Foster, I just find him to be a terrible actor and a charisma vacuum in everything he's in.</div></div><hr />

Weta is top dog but Legendary Pictures is pretty good. I mean regardless of who worked on the special effects the writing and script were absolutely horseshit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TickerDS</div><div class="date">2018-07-24, 06:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue wasn't Duncan Jones, the issue was the Hollywood Studio trying to direct what to do in the movie (Politics) <br />
<br />
I'm sure if Duncan Jones had free reign what to do with the movie, it would've been awesome. You can blame Universal Pictures if anything<br />
<br />
Hollywood Studios needs to keep hands off the movies, and stop making everything about Politics.<br />
<br />
To a certain extent, I agree.... though things like the cinematography, meaning the way some scenes were shot and the final filter/color pass of the movie and some of the look of the movie were things that Duncan could have fixed even just in post for the most part. <br />
<br />
Again, not saying the movie needed to go gritty per say, and Warcraft has always been a &quot;bright&quot; art style, but the sets would have looked better with a slightly different post production filter/color treatment....i.e. making the sets look less foam cuttoutish and more &quot;real&quot;. <br />
<br />
And even though the movie was clearly spliced and diced with input by too many people....in the end it is the directors job to get the performances out of actors, and a few of the performances are about as wooden as they come...and these are mostly solid actors...so that falls on Duncan in terms of getting the performance out of the live action actors. When the Orcs have better and more emotional dialog and emotes than the human actors...some of that is on the man directing the performance.<br />
<br />
After watching his Netflix thing and some of his other work, I really think he is a big picture guy, a producer. I don't think he is that great at putting the day to day direction of a movie together. But that is just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

I will say all the small props, armor, and things of that nature tended to be pretty good. There were a few bigger prop items that were excellent too, like the call board.</div></div><hr />
