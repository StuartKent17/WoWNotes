Warlords of Draenor - Priest Tier 17 Preview<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Priest Tier 17 armor set. You can try it on any race, including the new ones, with the modelviewer below. <br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor changes things up slightly by using one set of art for Raid Finder, one set of art for Normal and Heroic, and one set of art for Mythic difficulty. You can find the Raid Finder armor sets in our Raid Finder armor sets preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3940-Warlords-of-Draenor-Raid-Finder-Armor-Sets-Draenei-Guard-Armor-Set-Blue-Tweets-Art). <br />

Warlords of Draenor - About the Mekkatorque PvP Server<br />
As part of our Warlords of Draenor beta testing, we’ve opened up a new server with some special rules. The Mekkatorque (PvP) server is intended to provide a strong environment for PvP testing. Here’s how it works:<br />
<br />
When you create a character on Mekkatorque, it will automatically be boosted to level 100 and given a full set of level 100 PvP gear – no template creation necessary! However, you will not be able to access any of the new zones or dungeons available on the other beta servers (with the exception of Ashran, once it’s ready for testing).<br />
<br />
Of course, we still encourage you to try out all the new content coming in Warlords, too. For that, you’ll need to create a level 90 template character (or copy an existing level 90 character) on either the Lost Isles (PvE) or Gilneas (PvP) servers.<br />
<br />
Mekkatorque is also a great place for theorycrafters to test level 100 mechanics, such as with the variety of target dummies setup in Shattrath (the old one in Outland)<br />
<br />

Undead Bones Customization<br />
We're just not going to have time to get to anything beyond updating the options that already exist to new high poly/high res versions (already a monumental task) without holding up the entire expansion release. But like Chris said, all the ideas people have been throwing out for different cosmetic options and full character skins is super cool, and something we're actively thinking about. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/321975-hide-bones-options-for-the-undead-part-2/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10787138806?page=7#140))<br />
<br />
Why New Character Models?<br />
Because they were looking pretty outdated, of course. While our environment art gets better and better, dungeons and raids have higher fidelity, zones have more detail, as we update models for prominent heroes, introduce new enemies and bosses with high polys and high res textures, etc. etc. the old character models just look worse and worse by comparison. It was past due, really. But you are right, it's an enormous undertaking, and one our artists are extremely passionate about.<br />
<br />
But, to respond to your point about armor, yes that's true armor can cover a lot, but plenty of people do like to play with their helmet turned off--and it's nice to have a pretty face showing. But also the basic upgrade of polygon count and animation detail will have an effect all of the time, regardless of armor. Plus, updated character models are a shot-in-the-arm for any machinima makers out there looking to cut together WoW footage. Oh, and also, probably not super obvious but a lot of armor is actually just a texture directly on the geometry of the character. Any increase to the polys of that geometry can have a direct benefit to the way armor looks, new and old. And also now we can design gear to show off the male human high res nipples/chest hair. If we were so inclined.<br />
<br />
By this logic much of the vanilla game world needs a retexture at the very least. Most of the old mob models looks like they were ripped out of an N64 game and most of the trees are an eyesore.<br />
Uh, sure, and I'm sure we'd like to given the time, but the vast majority of people playing are high level, you continually are looking at your and other people's character model regardless of what zone or expansion you're in, and the old zones and creatures are usually quite relegated to their places in the world. Measuring bang-for-the-buck metrics, character models are about infinity times more important. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/321960-why-new-character-models/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13271387035?page=2#31))<br />
<br />
Raid Finder and Other Difficulties<br />
There's no right or wrong way to enjoy something.<br />
<br />
LFR definitely has a place in the game, even for organized raiders, but it is in many ways a different experience. The problem we want to solve is the LFR player that's been running LFR for a while and is now looking for something more, or the LFR player that doesn't particularly enjoy it but isn't quite sure how to take the next step. Our hope is that we can get players into more organized group content (like raiding) quickly and easily and successfully with the new Group Finder coming in Warlords of Draenor.

theorycraft question - I never see a reliable definition of statistical curve in weapon dmg range. Uniform chance? Normal dist?<br />
Uniform chance.101-200 dmg = 1% chance to get each integer in that range. No bell curve or anything complex involved. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478017763701563394))<br />
Good question though; not often do people question stuff that low-level. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478017857054187520))<br />

Is there any reason for Dark Transformation to be a button when it doesn't have a rune cost? Could be auto and pruned.<br />
Timing when you use it does have gameplay to it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/477975378590302208))<br />

Hey - confused about the change to Travel Form. What's the purpose of not being able to choose between stag/orca/bird?<br />
Saving keybinds by auto swapping to the appropriate travel form for you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/477974584684056576))<br />
<br />
Am I reading the patch notes correctly or did you just remove Haste from the moonkin aura?<br />
Yes, swapped it to... Mastery, I believe. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478071474583261184))<br />
<br />
what is the point in Guardian Druid lvl100 talent - Bristling Fur? isn't 3 sec too low?<br />
No; one of the most dangerous things for tanks is burst damage, and this solves any that you can anticipate. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478099464280764416))<br />
it's surely a usefull talent to have, but it feels just like 3rd charge on Survival Instincts, isn't it?<br />
Charges on abilities regenerate sequentially (You get 1 extra use per fight). Bristling Fur is an entirely separate ability. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478102805626892289))<br />

From what I have seen the Mage changes/pruning is very awesome. Except the proc'd FFB requiring a hard cast..it is too long!<br />

I'm not alone in my thinking. Many dps classes aren't restricted by spec in their ability to move.<br />
Mobility is an excellent way to differentiate specs. We see that as a good thing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/477979971743260672))<br />

movment for healers and DPS are being reduced, right I haven't seen any Changes for Mages in that area<br />

hi, any plans on fixing the rogue waiting for energy issue? or is downtime intended ? simcraft shows about 30-40% waiting time.<br />
Downtime intended; waiting for energy is extremely important for an energy-based model to work. If you don't, it's GCD limited. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478289843319869440))<br />

can you please reconsider the stat bonus you have in the new patch notes for resto shaman, master<br />
.We understand that the choice of stat attunement for some specs may seem strange. If so, improvements are likely coming. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/477973134226628608))<br />
Deep Healing, for example, is massively buffed by our new healing system, and it's tuning can go up as well. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/477973330306150401))<br />
DH is unnecessary according to the info I've seen so far, no spikey damage etc. DH really needs a complete redesign imho.<br />
I don't know what information you're referring to, but the changes to healing in Warlords objectively increase the value of DH. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/477976732478484480))<br />
My apologies, I meant DH in regards to Mastery, it's effectiveness is useless unless the target ... <br />
&quot;Useless&quot; is a gross mischaracterization. Average HP % will go down in WoD, increasing its value. Its effectiveness goes up. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478011949989392384))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
would be even cooler if N/H tier had physical distinguishment instead of color. Tier would feel &quot;completed&quot; across difficulties....<br />
that's very much the intent. Color shift wasn't enough to say &quot;badass&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/478302954559000578))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
What would b the point of having multiple sec stats if all are equal? At that point, might as well only have one.<br />
One being 5% stronger on Patchwerk doesn't make the other worthless. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478092775729033217))<br />
And different stats provide different situational strengths and weaknesses, and feelings. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478092986325024768))<br />
<br />
People freaking about _X_ Attunement. 5% buff to one secondary doesn't automatically put it ahead of the others in all cases no?<br />
Nope, it doesn't. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478093556268032001))<br />
<br />
I suppose, I would just rather closer secondaries for more varied builds than more railroading.<br />
We are doing closer secondaries. &quot;Railroading&quot; is imagined. Tuning assumes attunements passives. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478093964004712448))<br />
&quot;Usually, it will be your highest throughput stat&quot; kind of throws me off then, Seems very directed is all.<br />
It is. That's the point. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/478095723636875264))<br />

PvP<br />
Idk why it was removed to begin with. Lots of things in WoW aren't used/played. Pointlessly removed. Glad its back though.<br />
The old skirmish really wasn't used. I expect the new one will be. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/478214996879757312))<br />
<br />
is the plan to make Smirkishes a viable way to gear up, or just as a 'time-spender' ? I'm mainly wanting it as time-spender.<br />
It will be a viable way to gear up (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/478603982261059585))<br />
<br />
Along this thought, how far have you guys been able to push base resilience down so far? All the way to 0%?<br />
Increasing health relative to damage and reducing crit damage against players (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/478215152882708480))<br />
The question was &quot;how far&quot; not &quot;how&quot;, but the answer is 0%, yes. It's in the patch notes.<br />
Ah yes 0% right now but definitely keeping it in out back pocket. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/478216381453045760))<br />
<br />
I know it's an incredible amount of work to make gear models, but did you really think the community would be okay with sharing?<br />
there are always tradeoffs to change that are bound to make someone unhappy. We think the aspirational upside is worth it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/478254211734306816))<br />
<br />
Please make sure Ashran is perfect, WoW desperately needs new kind of PvP, its what is selling the entire expansion to me.<br />
We really do agree that PvP needs a new kind of content to provide some variety. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/478322218741407746))<br />
<br />
World<br />
there are to be more rares for end game.. not sure the details on those though.<br />
Levelling rares drop mostly levelling items, endgame rares = endgame stuff (toys, tradeskill mats, etc) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/478254534846717952))<br />
Will end game rares only appear in certain zones or zone?<br />

That's all well and good, but Org and the surrounding are still look like a Stalinist nightmare.<br />

In my view, you just get in the fun early and can pace and enjoy the expansion, and then when it launches you can rush to cap because thats when the game begins</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well to be fair, MMO-champion is typically visited by long time players. As they invite wow veterans prio you'd get a larger percentage of MMO-Champ users as beta invites.<br />
<br />
Still, it does seem more invites going out then most expected for the first beta wave.</div></div><hr />

Probably some YouTubers will get guaranteed invites which of they will make a video about and then forget it yet the people who genuinely want access to the BETA will be left to dry. Been a player since the end of Vanilla and not a single BETA invite from Blizzard. Sure a little on and off relationship with WoW but who hasnt been like that? Thats why I kinda feel like Blizzard is giving me the middle finger when it comes to BETA invites...<br />

Sounds like a load.<br />
<br />
No one needs to change accounts because they can't afford a subscription.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I understand that, but when they rather count a WoTLK account as a veteran than mine, I get pissed of. Had they just said &quot;We gave X ammounts of invites at random&quot; I would not have cared, and just kept my hopes up to be in the following wave/waves of invites.</div></div><hr />

I know that. Guess we will see. I'm not talking only content though, but the amount for wierd bugs in the alpha.<br />
<br />
In any case, I don't understand why people wanna be beta testers as badly sas it seem some people do. I tried it once, and couldn't bring myself to do much as whatever I did would just be &quot;deleted&quot; and as a result somewhat pointless.<br />
<br />
I applaud beta testers though as they help make the game better for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, let's be honest, 11 tickets regarding dissatisfaction is enough to make them remove you from a list of potential invites. There are better ways to submit feedback to blizzard without resorting to opening tickets. If you're that frustrated with the game, have a nice break. You may find something else you like better. You may enjoy the time elsewhere. You'll probably get an invite eventually, regardless. <br />
<br />
To the others who feel entitled, I am simply astounded at the arrogance displayed. Yes, I got an invite. I've been in 2 alphas and every beta early in the process. Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you don't. Just hang in there, it's early.</div></div><hr />
