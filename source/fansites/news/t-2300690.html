Some last minute changes were made to the Netherlight Crucible (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6942-Patch-7-3-Artifact-Changes-and-the-Netherlight-Crucible) powers.<br />
We’ve made a final tuning pass on the Netherlight Crucible to ensure that its powers behave more like the trinkets that you know and love.<br />
<br />
In general, these changes are intended to bring the value of the various powers closer together, and ensure they’re desirable choices for players. We’ve loosened the restrictions these powers had on the PTR, so effects that previously did not take your character’s modifiers into account are now improved by things like Haste and Critical Strike, and relevant buffs or debuffs that are part of your class. We also updated numerical tuning to take those changes into account.<br />
<br />
Tuning Changes: <br />
<br />
Master of Shadows (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/252091-master-of-shadows) – Value reduced to 500.<br />
Murderous Intent (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/252191-murderous-intent) – Value reduced to 1500.<br />
Dark Sorrows (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/252922-dark-sorrows) – Proc rate increased by Haste. <br />
Torment the Weak (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/252906-torment-the-weak) – Value reduced to 80,000. Damage over Time effect now increased by haste and can crit.<br />
Chaotic Darkness (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/252888-chaotic-darkness) – Proc rate increased by Haste. <br />
Shadowbind (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/252875-shadowbind) – Value increased to 200,000. Proc rate increased by haste. <br />
Light Speed (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/252088-light-speed) – Value reduced to 500.<br />
Shocklight (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/252799-shocklight) – Value reduced to 1500.<br />
Secure in the Light (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/253070-secure-in-the-light) – Value increased to 135,000. Proc rate increased by haste. <br />
Infusion of Light (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/253093-infusion-of-light) - Value reduced to 101,000. Proc rate increased by haste. <br />
Light's Embrace (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/253111-lights-embrace) – Value increased to 45,500. Proc rate increased by haste. <br />

<br />
<br />
The above all differ from what you may have seen on the PTR, and we appreciate the time and effort that testers put into providing the feedback we received.</div></div><hr />

cause your totally going to pick holy ones as shadow....<br />
<br />
and some of the shadow ones do work for mages, they have there own internal damage difference, for classes that dont have shadow/holy multipliers.<br />
<br />
aka the shadow damage proc does more damage on a mage baseline then it does for a shadowpriest.</div></div><hr />

You can't control your choices so you might have to. All classes except mages and shadow priest have multipliers to all damage. For shadow priests and mages it is specific to their 1 school of magic damage. Causing issues with trinket proc damage for months and still going on now.</div></div><hr />

They're making it more like the trinkets whose PPM can be increased by haste rating.</div></div><hr />

except the trinkets with increased PPM proccing off of haste again, which Shadowpriests will reck at, and mages do well enough at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MM hunters have multiplier only to focus spenders, so it does jack shit to us too, and haste is near worthless after a few percent. Bm hunter too have mastery that increases only pet and dire beast damage, but haste is more valuable to them.</div></div><hr />

These effects ignore outside damage mods completely, Unholy Death Knight mastery has zero effect on the shadow half.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a good point, and a tough crowd to make it to! :salute:<br />
<br />
The fact is we do have control via choices but ultimately there's some RNG via procs and such. It's a fine line, yes, but as you said it's ultimately more interesting than flat buffs.</div></div><hr />

The crucible i believe is extremely OP, not because of the offensive parts, but because of the shield-like abilities and self-heals which will account for way less deaths on mythic progression.

<br />
Because OP is not the same as fun and RNG is exactly the opposite of fun. But I'm sure NC will be fun eventually what with Blizzard changing the values every day. I guess all that time on the PTR wasn't enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't that the point of this? Blizz said over and over that it's an indirect nerf to ToS. Antorus will be tuned assuming people have access to this. I don't see the big deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is their mastery that is an entirely different thing. The damage buff from specs weapons is a flat dmg increase for all specs except the 3 mage specs and shadow priests. For them it is only for their specs school of magic.</div></div><hr />

Which now is only 5%? The 10% trait is all damage, it's not spec specific.</div></div><hr />

Getting 5% more sure is a nice buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These bonuses add roughly 5-20k DPS, so 5% is fairly miniscule in the grand scheme of things. Losing out on 1-3k DPS when you are doing 1.5 Million is nothing.</div></div><hr />
