Patch 7.2 - Demon Hunter Class Mount<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Demon Hunter class mount. It's also worth nothing that Demon Hunters can purchase A Tiny Set of Warglaives (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/147537-a-tiny-set-of-warglaives) from a vendor in their Class Hall for 1000 x Order Resources (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1220-order-resources). <br />

Rend - New Survival Game<br />
A few ex-World of Warcraft developers have come together to make a survival game with both PvP and PvE elements. Neal Acree created the music in the trailer below. Check out Gamepedia (http://www.gamepedia.com/news/1442-rend-is-a-new-survival-hybrid-game-from-vanilla) for more details about the game, scheduled to be released to Steam early access in early 2017.<br />

How great would it be if these worked similar to our artifact weapons? Various achievements could unlock new appearances for our class mount - different colors, different armor, etc.<br />

For many of us, mounts are part of our overall transmog (just like our weapons). Having only one appearance is limiting in that respect. Yeah, we can use other mounts, just like we can mog our artifacts into other weapons, but we all enjoy collecting alternative skins for our artifacts. I'm betting most of us would enjoy doing the same for our class mounts.</div></div><hr />

They know that if you want to be number 1 in some activities you have to actually invest more time then everyone else in the world for it? It's simple logic. For example, in sport the bar is set by the best runner/swimmer etc, here is set by Blizzard. Can't reach or sustain it? Too bad for you, let who can do it win and claim their spot.

<br />
They're raising extremely valid points. They don't want to just clear everything in 1 week. They want to be able to change specs and change classes as needed, and not just be locked into one class with one spec or face a mind bogglingly long and boring grind to add a single other spec (of whatever class) as an option.<br />
They put in more hours grinding for progression raiding than anyone, and now they're being asked to double that time requirement.<br />
<br />
And those points are valid for regular players, too. I've got a bunch of chars at rank 34 artifact weapons, so they're all semi-playable, but none of them are competitive with the players who stuck to just one spec on one character. And they're all short on legendaries, because I chose to play multiple characters instead of just one.<br />
<br />
It's a horrible system, and it really sucks the fun out of alts and the game in general.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of good elements to Legion, but those I just mentioned are game breaking. They're vampire mechanics that suck the fun right out of endgame content.<br />
<br />
And then there are the broken specs. Hunters got royally fucked in 7.1.5, and many classes have talents that just plain don't make any sense, leaving you with only one real worthwhile option per tier.</div></div><hr />

Plus you lie, they only want AP/character, not weapon, which is just fine, as it won't affect you at all. This is supposed to be a game, not a job. They also just want increased drop rates for legendaries, which yet again, would not affect you.<br />
<br />
Well, if you can also tell me what lies in the future, o great one!<br />
<br />
I care about AP not being per character, because i am a damn casual that want to collect a tiny bit of AP every day for the 30 minute i can play, and not maxing out after 2 weeks. And i don't want increase drop rates for legendaries, i want a sense of surprise when i get them, and not just an item in my bag to change when i want. And you know why? Because in the end, you are right, this is a GAME, not a job.<br />

<br />
The only thing i see here it's how Blizzard made the game too easy for the &quot;hardcore&quot; players last expansions, specially in WoD. Now everyone and their son want to be competitive in MYTHIC (THE PINNACLE OF DIFFICULTY) with 10 alts and 20 specs. 34 trait are more then enough for clearing non mythic content. You want more? You step up. <br />
<br />
The system cuold be better? Of course, everything in the universe can be better, but i prefer this then the boredom of WoD (for someone who does not only raid).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doffen</div><div class="date">2017-03-14, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First interview I have read from the top end guilds who could actually reflect a bit. Especially Kaowa there had some good points. And see that blizzard is doing very good for us more casual people, but yes I also can understand that for a top 10-20 raiding guild its a bit more to do now to stay competetive. Yes, Legendary system could do some work, AP is fine how it is, but for top mythic guilds, lots of farming. The comment about Maw of Souls and the picture was hilarious :P <br />
<br />
But for Midwinter retiring, looks that real life took some of the officers, and they didn't want to do the job to get new people in their officer-system, more than the AP-legendary grind itself. Since most of their rooster is going to another guild. They didn't blame AP/legendary for it though, but I am pretty sure someone on these forums will take it that way and use them as another example why Legion sucks! :P</div></div><hr />

you mean like how the mount literally exactly pairs with your new teir? <br />

<br />
Grinding AP is the absolutely worst experience I've had this expansion though, if not this game, and it's up there with TBC mats grinding when you can use as many elixirs as possible, and I actually didn't get 54 until I had high ak (the week that NH hit). My guild didn't require anyone to grind to 54, but most people did, because raiding is a team effort, and if you are able to get up to 10% extra damage as well as some mitigation and stamina, completely RNG free, why aren't you doing it?<br />
<br />
The whole war on casual versus raider is so stupid. How many casual people are in the game just to progress one spec for one character? If anything, from my personal experience with more casual players, casual players care about multiple aspects of a character and level alts more than hardcore people do because that's how they spend their time in game. Doing this AP locking into one weapon thing is limiting the game experience of almost everyone .<br />
<br />
Yeah, I understand if your mentality is &quot;oh, i'll just grab whatever AP i see and i will &quot;eventually&quot; max out. My raids (assuming doing any)? Fuck them, 0.5% damage/healing per point of trait is a crutch anyway. I shouldn't need to &quot;work&quot; in a game&quot;<br />
<br />
The issue is blizzard making this aspect of the game like work and not people trying to do something to min/max their character on a level that they can control. The game has enough carrot in the game with WF/TF and legendaries, it does't need more.<br />
<br />
Midwinter is just one of the more well-known guilds that folded because of this. There are many top 200-300 world guilds that folded and while AP grinding may not be a definitive issue, it is definitely a huge factor for straining players.</div></div><hr />

How many wear current tier as their mog? We all have different tastes, and 9 out of 10 mog whatever we get. Are you wishing Blizz only gave us one artifact appearance, and had that match the current mog?<br />

Probably not. They said there are more ptr builds coming and also that there will be a long quest line on the broken shore similar to the one in Suramar.<br />
<br />
My guess is closer to the end of March or early April.<br />
<br />
Who knows. I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

Because only teenagers like stuff like transmog. Everyone else prefers to have only one appearance to choose from.<br />

Use a different mount like everyone else. As for your alternative skin idea, would cost us a whole expansion, Bad idea.<br />
<br />
I will be using a different mount until they give us more options, but was hoping we'd get a felbat from day 1. DKs got a skele starter flying mount, why shouldn't we get a basic demonic one? If you like the fancy model, good for you, but it's always nice to have choices. No way it would cost us an expansion. Blizz always works up several variations on all their models; that's why we end up with so many re-skins. I'm simply suggesting they use some of those the same way they've used various artifact skins.<br />

We all have different tastes, and 9 out of 10 mog whatever we get. Are you wishing Blizz only gave us one artifact appearance, and had that match the current mog?<br />
<br />
so lets see ,the class got aded only 2 patches ago<br />
and your complaining because of lack of sets?<br />
cause here is the thing, all the demon hunter sets are rather dark, but alot of them contain bright bright gold and purple, so it very uch fits the mount, for example<br />

I don't remember complaining about lack of sets, or criticizing players who like to have their toons bright and glowing. I just suggested it would be nice to have options on the mount since not everyone has the same tastes. Is that such a radical idea?<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh I see how you might have thought that's what I meant. When I asked &quot;How many of us use the current tier without transmogging?&quot;, I meant all WoW players, not just DHs. Most players use the transmog feature to customize their appearance. There's always a few using gear however it comes, but that's a minority, in my experience.</div></div><hr />

more of that i feel even if they had a second choice you would still complain</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? Why? If you look over my posts, I'm pretty even tempered and mostly positive. I'm just thinking it would be nice to have a mount that matches my transmog, just like we can choose artifact skins to match our transmog.</div></div><hr />

well yes, but it having a second colour doesent make it much morel ikely to fit your mog, it would most likley be silver trim with red, and the bat itself being red aswell or pinkish</div></div><hr />

Sure. What I'm suggesting is something like they already do for artifact weapons. Do it through the class order hall, since it is class related. Various achievements for raiding, WQs, PvP, etc., to unlock new mount appearances. Players love farming mounts. Blizz artists usually have re-colors and off-shoots they have worked on but haven't used yet anyway. This would be another fun feature for all of us!</div></div><hr />

yes the artifact thing would have been much cooler, thats what i was hoping it was originally, but sadly tat would take much much more dev time</div></div><hr />

They almost always come out with mount variants eventually. Maybe we'll get some for 7.2.5.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile the Corrupted Dreadwing (http://www.wowhead.com/item=123974/reins-of-the-corrupted-dreadwing#teaches-ability) is a pretty good match for my DH.</div></div><hr />
