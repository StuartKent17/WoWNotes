As we previously announced, free character moves will become available in this region very soon. When these free character moves open, player-characters at any level will be able to move:<br />
<br />
From -&gt; To<br />
<br />
Arugal -&gt; Felstriker<br />
Faerlina -&gt; Heartseeker (new realm)<br />
Stalagg -&gt; Heartseeker (new realm)<br />
Herod -&gt; Earthfury (new realm)<br />
Skeram -&gt; Earthfury (new realm)<br />
Incendius -&gt; Netherwind<br />
Thalnos -&gt; Netherwind<br />
Fairbanks -&gt; Arcanite Reaper (new realm)<br />
Whitemane -&gt; Arcanite Reaper (new realm)<br />
Bigglesworth -&gt; Anathema<br />
Pagle -&gt; Windseeker<br />
Grobbulus -&gt; Deviate Delight<br />
<br />
<br />
For approximately one day, the new realms will be restricted to only those players using a free character move. After one day, any player may create new characters there. This is to allow players using the free character move service a better chance at retaining the name of the character they’re moving.<br />
<br />
We will let you know when the new realms open and free character moves are enabled.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

EXCELLENT thinking Blizz. +1 for this. Allays much of the potential negativity over moving realms I would imagine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully soon. Any character that have not entered the world should have their name free'd up. In another week, any character that has not reach level 3-4 should have their name free'd up.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this would help with those that want certain names but they're being taken by people that wont use them</div></div><hr />

So... you think that making low populated servers even less populated ... and increasing queues on big ones is the answer? :confused:</div></div><hr />

What's your solution for dead servers then?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sch1ntus</div><div class="date">2019-09-04, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they should have launched Classic with a good amount of servers based on the name reservations and the stress test data.<br />
<br />
Then as people increasingly logged on to play, those servers should be scaled up over several iterations. That way people can keep playing. But also because it's 2019, and we have basically every technology/technique at hand to solve problems arising from scaling up servers...<br />
<br />
And when the &quot;hype&quot; is over, and people leave, servers can be merged + scaled down appropriately.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RamGuy</div><div class="date">2019-09-04, 08:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice support for EU as always..not like we have 400-500min queues every evening. XD<br />
<br />
We are getting Free Transfers as well.<br />
<br />
It's stupid to have free transfers at this point. Communities have already bleed out everywhere.<br />
<br />
We was recommended to move from Shazzrah to Gehennas, then from Gehennas to Firemaw before release. At release it seems like so many decided to move to Firemaw due to Blizzards recommendations making it has just as long, if not longer queues than Shazzrah and Gehennas.<br />
<br />
Blizzards starts opening new servers right after release. But who moves large communities post-release? That's very difficult to do. And suddenly you end up in a situation where the server you announced before release has 20k+ queues, a lot of members are logged in and have already invested over 20 hours on this server, while others just can't cope with the queues and jumps to the newest server without queues.<br />
<br />
But as Blizzard was so slow with new servers, even those created right after release suddenly have 8k+ queues in no time, they open even more servers and suddenly you have parts of your community bleeding to not only one different server, but to several others. After the first week we have members on five different servers....<br />
<br />
<br />
Most have still stayed on Firemaw, most people know that the game will be massively overhyped and a lot of people are playing 24/7 for the first 7-14 days. But this will slow down A LOT after 14 days+ so we have just been dealing with the queue as we know it will get much better soon.<br />
<br />
But then suddenly Blizzard decides, only 8 days after release that they will open free transfers.......... Breaking the community even further as you will end up having a lot of people using in, while others don't. Moving to a fresh server when you know the game will have a huge drop-off in the coming weeks is a risky move to make so the community decides to stay, but when members will see this free transfer option popping in their face while they are sitting in a 8k queue you bet some will move breaking up things further.<br />
<br />
<br />
The queues are still really bad on many servers, but the game has only been out for 8 days. They should have waited for at least 14 days, or even 21 days before opening for free transfer IF there still are huge issues with queues. The hype has started to settle, but give it another week or two and many of the more casual players will most likely be gone, or at least be playing like 1/10 of the amount of time per day as they have been thus far.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now everyone is loosing... The bad handling and how Blizzard underestimated the hype so immensely has made this a huge mess. With free transfer this early you just break things even further and those of us who have been dealing with queues for 8 days to ensure to be playing on a healthy server is now risking to have too many leaving making the server more deserted, or forcing us to move to a server we have no clue will have a healthy population or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realise that a medium server today has more players than a full realm in vanilla? If the zones feel dead it's because of a) layering or b) you're ahead of the curve level wise</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts exactly. I start wondering if it was not the plan all along. It wouldn't surprise me at this point.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobleshield</div><div class="date">2019-09-04, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think they should open more servers, there are a few that don't seem as populated and the people I've spoke to feel they are in danger of becoming low/dead when the hype dies down. The transfers should be from the high pop to those lower pop servers, not adding more. At some point, some of these servers are going to die off, and that will just piss everyone off who moved there or who accidentally picked those servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not how it works though. Server pop classifications are relative to other realms. So if players burn out equally then medium realms will still be medium and high pop realms will still be high pop. <br />
<br />
I also think that dynamics spawns in low level zones and layering have given people a false sense of what high pop realms are really like. Once layering is removed and the bulk of the playerbase is 60, people will see how &quot;fun&quot; it is to compete to resources nearly everywhere.</div></div><hr />

False, at least when it comes to Classic. <br />
<br />
They specifically stated this wasn't the case last week as they did not want to mislead people into selecting a full realm.</div></div><hr />

The best part about all of this... Blizz never allowed PAID character transfers until TBC.. People acting like they can play on a dead server and get transferred to a GOD STATUS server like Herod are total jackass's<br />

NONE of the servers are 'low' pop right now. I've been running the censusplus addon several times a day every day on Rattlegore (a typically medium server), and it regularly hits 6000+ people during the week and it went over 10,000 this weekend.<br />
<br />
The point where queues kicked in during WoW's original release in 2004, was 2000-2500 people... And when layering is lifted and suddenly you see 5000-10,000 people running around instead of the 1000 in your layer? Don't come bitching about too many people/not enough mobs...</div></div><hr />

Hopefully this would help with those that want certain names but they're being taken by people that wont use them<br />

You have no idea how many level 1 bank toons there are, do you? Hands off. Leveling is not an indication of use.</div></div><hr />

Please, kindly show us 1 dead classic server.<br />

and then in 3months when classic is dead and everyone is crying there's no one around, you'll then merge servers<br />
Then everyone will cry they lost their super cool naruto name cause you merged servers and only one Naruto can exist.<br />

If you hate classic so much WHY DO YOU EVEN CARE ABOUT THE HEALTH OF THE CLASSIC SERVERS.<br />
<br />
So much complaining from people that don't even play. gtfo<br />
<br />
This person has a point here, the whole point of this exercise was to not have to do the same things with Classic that have taken place with retail over the years, between merging servers and later having to cross-realm battle groups with one another. All that does is further fracture a community, not sustain a healthy server community or an entire Classic community. It turns the Classic community into everything retail has turned into over many years now. <br />
<br />
This what many have not been able to grasp in why Blizzard was reserved in wanting the community, more specifically, the initial server community to not build and remain a healthy community. Offering free transfers after a week of play is just going down the same rabbit hole that retail had taken for many years ago. Which defeats the entire purpose of having Classic as an alternative to retail. <br />
<br />
Given what this has already turned to in a week's time, I can't see why Blizzard would want to do the same thing with BC and Wrath now. It could be as this person says, 3 months from now, Classic could be the same toxic toilet that retail is today.</div></div><hr />

The problem right now is that those servers are not just way beyond capacity, they are way beyond capacity with all the original layers + new layers that were added. Once phase 2 hits, all the layers disappear and get squeezed back into a single layer and server. That means, you are still likely to have queues on the big realms once layers disappear, but the queues will be smaller.<br />
<br />
But nice post. Doesn't come across like an emo teen at all. Not at all.</div></div><hr />

All these people fixated on the Short Term &quot;OH WOW LOOK AT ALL THE HIGH/FULL SERVERS&quot;... yet in a month or two's time when (A) 8.2.5 releases and/or (B) people get burned out from Classic (very real possibility here) and there's dead servers what's the plan? High to Low migration? &quot;fuck no I don't want a free move to Ashkandi that server sucks&quot;. or &quot;I'm not leaving my established guild now that server queue times are lower&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh. and they're opening 3 new US PVP Servers for this. and 2 new EU-EN PVP servers<br />
<br />
Why not give everyone the option to migrate to ESTABLISHED servers first instead of keeping on opening new servers</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are talking about over time, and it's a fair concern. Typically, the consolation realms die out faster than the full ones with servers and blizzard has shown in the past a damn near criminal negligence on behalf of dead servers. they have got me 3x on 'consolation' servers only to end up on a dead server and having to pay them.<br />
<br />
It won't happen this time. I'll suffer queues as long as i get to play on a realm that will stay full long term like herod, whiteman, shazzrah, etc.<br />
<br />
The newer the realm, the faster it'll die out and blizz has shown they wont merge realms or offer paid transfers/lvling in classic... so why risk being on a dead server to alleviate their queues when they COULD Just stack layers like a lasagna until it stopped and instead of removing layering going into p2, remove it at the end of p2 when the population has dwindled down naturally over time.</div></div><hr />

Update 19:45 CEST<br />
<br />
Free character moves are now available for the French and German realms listed below. We are working to open the free character moves on English realms, and expect to have completed that process soon. Thank you for your patience!<br />
<br />
As we previously announced, free character moves will become available in Europe very soon™. When these free character moves open, player-characters at any level will be able to move:<br />
<br />
English<br />
<br />
FROM TO<br />
Shazzrah Dragonfang (new realm)<br />
Golemagg Dragonfang (new realm)<br />
Firemaw Earthshaker (new realm)<br />
Gehennas Earthshaker (new realm)<br />
Mograine Judgement<br />
Razorgore Bloodfang<br />
<br />
French<br />
<br />
FROM TO<br />
Sulfuron Finkle<br />
<br />
German<br />
<br />
FROM TO<br />
Lucifron Heartstriker (new realm)<br />
Venoxis Heartstriker (new realm)<br />
<br />
For approximately one day, the new realms will be restricted to only those players using a free character move. After one day, any player may create new characters there. This is to allow players using the free character move service a better chance at retaining the name of the character they’re moving.<br />
<br />
Please note that restrictions apply:<br />
<br />
A character cannot move if the character:<br />
is a guild leader.<br />
has active auction listings or bids.<br />
 has mail.<br />
You may be required to change your character’s name once you’ve reached the destination realm.<br />
This is a one-way, irreversible move.<br />
<br />
During periods of high usage, free character moves may take up to several hours to complete. This service may be closed at any time, without warning, should a destination realm become full. We strongly encourage players who wish to use this service, especially in coordinated groups, to do so as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
We will let you know when the new realms open and free character moves are enabled.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</div></div><hr />

Sorry but the drop off won't be that significant. <br />
There will be drop off for sure but it'll be a lot less then your projection. <br />
<br />
Also keep in mind, players will drop off and come back for each Phase. <br />
<br />
Within 1 year, expect about a 50% drop off.</div></div><hr />

Because people enjoying their time on established servers dont want a bunch of immigrants flooding in and ruining their servers.<br />
Its not complicated.<br />
I dont understand the endless whining, this must be why BFA is the way it is.</div></div><hr />
