PvP Gear Models<br />
The look of the sets will improve as the seasons continue. If we started the first sets of PvP gear with asteroids orbiting the shoulders, in a couple seasons you'd be wearing Thrall on your head. <br />
<br />
Under the current design philosophy, the idea is that in PvE you're killing very rare and challenging creatures of Azeroth, while in PvP you're receiving gear from the crafters (so to speak) of your faction to get you battle-ready. Chances are you're going to be given the gear that'll get the job done rather than the gear that has to be constructed entirely out of the nipples of a 7,000 year-old dragon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13723532365-pvp-sets.html))<br />
<br />
PvP Gear and arena points/rating requirements<br />
The highest-quality PvP gear is obtained via the arena system. Nothing has changed in that regard. Those who choose to focus on battlegrounds for all PvP engagement still have access to good-quality PvP items. Under the current functionality though, the arena system provides a much better measurement of skill over time investment than battlegrounds. With that being said, we are working to develop a better system for measuring performance in battlegrounds. We have been saying this since Wrath beta, however, we have no additional information to provide at this point. <br />
<br />
The guy playing AFKave day in, day out should not have access to the same gear as the guy with a 2000 arena rating. This is mostly our fault and we're working on a better system for rewarding contribution in battlegrounds. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13593901426-seeking-acknowledgment-for-pvp-debacle.html))<br />
<br />
Level 70 PvP Gear missing<br />
It was not removed. We're aware of the issue of this gear being currently unavailable and plan to make them available for purchase again in the near future. I don't have an exact time frame for you right now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13594170397-70-pvp-gear.html))<br />
<br />
Healer shortage<br />
If there is a healer shortage at all, I expect it is because many players are still questing. Even if they are 80, there are a ton of quests in Icecrown, a lot of dailies, and things like Hodir rep to work on. While healing specs are probably better able to solo than they were in BC, we still don't pretend they have all the damage and tools of a dps-focused character.<br />
<br />
I also like to think that we made the dps-specs of priests, paladins, druids and shamans all a little more viable and fun to play than they used to be, so some healers may be trying those out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13594099857-why-exactly-is-there-a-healer-shortage.html))<br />
<br />
Healing redesign<br />
As I have frequently opined, healers who don't like healing is kind of a tough problem to solve.<br />
<br />
There are certainly healers who do like healing. That's why they play the game. For them watching health bars IS enjoying the game. We don't want to pull what they enjoy out of the game (at least without a very good reason). The question is are there enough of those players? If they are 1 in 100, then it's a problem.<br />
<br />
As I have also said, this is something we are spending a lot of effort to work on, but it is emphatically not the kind of change where a couple of simple tweaks get you there. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13594099857-why-exactly-is-there-a-healer-shortage.html))<br />
<br />
Winter Veil Gifts<br />
There are some quests you can do by which you can receive gifts, but the gifts under the trees won't be available to open until the 25th. No peeking either! The Feast of Winter Veil doesn't end until the 1st (midnight) of January. Hopefully, that will give everyone a chance to get a gift. If not, just think of all the joy you get of visiting your family and friends! (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13593901232-greatfather-winter-gifts.html))<br />

Nourish<br />
I think you should take a harder look at Nourish. We received so much feedback on Nourish that I was sort of going along with the conventional wisdom that Nourish didn't fill a large enough role. Since then a few druids have set me straight. It can be a really amazing spell.<br />
<br />
Glyphed Regrowth is also a really good spell, but it is still a hot -- it doesn't get the health out to the target as fast as Nourish.<br />
<br />
If you're a big (glyphed) Healing Touch fan, then I can see how you might use it instead of Nourish, especially if you run heroics a lot (and so are filling all of the healing roles yourself). But if I was taking any button off of my bar for raiding, it would be HT and not Nourish. <br />
<br />
When Nourish came up in beta, some druids asked &quot;Why would I use Nourish when I have Regrowth?&quot; The answer is that Regrowth is an amazing spell (finally), but it's not a flash heal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/13392161615-how-to-make-nourish-less-useless.html))<br />

<br />
Judgement of Light<br />
One of the changes in 3.0.8 that we may or may not have announced is that we changed Judgment of Light to do no threat in order to fix some of this seemingly random behavior. We aren't trying to nerf Prot paladin threat overall with this change.<br />
<br />
The topic came up again recently when Protadin OTs were accidentally pulling off the MT with huge threat spikes while tanking adds etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12454617434-tankadin--judgement-of-light-hurts-my-raid.html))<br />

Glyph of Dispel (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=42397) nerf<br />
The glyph was just overpowered. It was meant to be a neat little bonus when you dispelled someone, not a new way to spam heals or to make someone really, really pay for putting a debuff on one of your guys. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13623093196-priest-nerf-makes-no-sense.html))<br />

Egg of Mortal Essence (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40685) not procing from Healing Stream Totem<br />
It won't proc off of items and Healing Stream is a totem. Bad things would happen if it proc'd off of items.<br />
<br />
It should work fine with all your other heals. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13593871538-egg-of-mortal-essence--healing-stream-broken.html))<br />

Serious security flaw found in IE <br />
A vulnerability has been discovered and the 27% of users of this site using Internet Explorer should probably install this hotfix as soon as possible (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms08-078.mspx). <br />
<br />
From BBC.co.uk (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7784908.stm)<br />
The flaw in Microsoft's Internet Explorer could allow criminals to take control of people's computers and steal their passwords, internet experts say.<br />
<br />
Microsoft urged people to be vigilant while it investigated and prepared an emergency patch to resolve it. Internet Explorer is used by the vast majority of the world's computer users. <br />
<br />
&quot;Microsoft is continuing its investigation of public reports of attacks against a new vulnerability in Internet Explorer,&quot; said the firm in a security advisory alert about the flaw.<br />
<br />
Microsoft says it has detected attacks against IE 7.0 but said the &quot;underlying vulnerability&quot; was present in all versions of the browser. Other browsers, such as Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Safari, are not vulnerable to the flaw Microsoft has identified. <br />
<br />
Browser bait<br />
&quot;In this case, hackers found the hole before Microsoft did,&quot; said Rick Ferguson, senior security advisor at Trend Micro. &quot;This is never a good thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
As many as 10,000 websites have been compromised since the vulnerability was discovered, he said.<br />
<br />
&quot;What we've seen from the exploit so far is it stealing game passwords, but it's inevitable that it will be adapted by criminals,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just a question of modifying the payload the trojan installs.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;The message needs to get out that this malicious code can be planted on any web site, so simple careful browsing isn't enough.&quot; <br />

my guild having many active healers. Looking PUG it is mostly &quot;3 DD looking for tank+healer&quot;, true. Though<br />
tank-search seems to me the worst part of it. And in the LFG-Tool you usually find tons of DD's (and some<br />
tanks ONLY for Utgarde Tower - often many who cannot manage the harpune boss encounter). And half<br />
of the tanks you find are deathknights with 20k life in frost-stance who have too little experience to do <br />
decent tanking :( Originally wanted to level my DK DD as primary alt - now I am going to level my Paladin<br />
tank instead as primary alt...<br />
<br />
It seems to me though that &quot;we made the DD Spec a little too attractive&quot; is an understatement. It seems to me that 90% at least of Paladins you encounter are DD these days. Not much difference for Shamans. Neither for Druids. And many peole who played Warrior tank on TBC seem to play Fury now, it seems to me.</div></div><hr />

[b]PvP Gear Models<br />
The look of the sets will improve as the seasons continue. If we started the first sets of PvP gear with asteroids orbiting the shoulders, in a couple seasons you'd be wearing Thrall on your head. <br />
<br />
Under the current design philosophy, the idea is that in PvE you're killing very rare and challenging creatures of Azeroth, while in PvP you're receiving gear from the crafters (so to speak) of your faction to get you battle-ready. Chances are you're going to be given the gear that'll get the job done rather than the gear that has to be constructed entirely out of the nipples of a 7,000 year-old dragon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/13723532365-pvp-sets.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is one of the worst answers to an obvious screwup that I've ever seen. If this was in fact the case, the s1 armor set in BC wouldn't have looked so hot either, somewat like the dungeon sets. I think many of you will agree that t4/s1 armor looked pretty darn good in most cases. But nono, these s5 gear models look like absolute shit, the devs don't wanna admit it or apologize in any way...they just spoonfeed us some garbage answer using dragon nipples.<br />

And they're trying to not only not take responsilbility for their laziness, but they're trying to go one step further and say that PVP/Arena armors aren't supposed to really look all that good. Huh? Am I missing something here or are arena sets not historically just recolored raid sets. This season may not be a recolored raid set...because the raid sets are already recolored t3!!! I can guarantee that this new information won't mean that blizz will actually take some time and create new armor models for each arena season...they're just going to post this shit excuse hoping people accept it and then forget about it by next season. Didn't fool me blizz sorry.<br />

Yes, it was even on usatoday.com. Alot of people have recently been abandoning IE for Firefox via www.mozilla.org, because apparently Microsoft doesn't seem to be in a hurry to fix the issue. Plus, I found Firefox works alot faster and more secure to browse the internet. My suggestion is to absolutely stop using IE and download Firefox ASAP! You definitely won't be disappointed. <br />
<br />
As far as the game has been acting lately, I haven't seen any issues with Naxx at the moment. But, old world instances I have. I tried to run my brother through SFK yesterday, and when we tried to enter the instance, we kept getting an error. something like &quot;No more instances can be launched at this time. Please try again later&quot;</div></div><hr />

Isn't that pretty much what they're saying, what's the solution then? I'm hoping there's a solution aside from waiting from instance traffic to go down, if anything it will go up as more people hit 80.</div></div><hr />

One of the shammies I plays with has had his account hacked 4 times in the last week and he can't figure out why. None of the spyware programs are catching anything, and he actually is using Firefox. It's obviously a key logger of some sort but we just can't find the damn thing with any of the tools we use. I guess Firefox will fix this recent IE security snafu, but I'm not sure it's fixing everything.<br />

If you're absolutely insane about security and want to be part of the &quot;I've never been hacked&quot; club you can actually run WoW on Linux. This is *not* for the squeamish or technically-challenged by any stretch, but it does work (I played for 2 years under Ubuntu 64 bit): https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WorldofWarcraft</div></div><hr />

<br />
The dispel glyph actually was overpowered for two reasons:<br />
1. With PvP gear comes a lot of stamina, making something that scales from the target's stamina potentially extremely good if able to cast in rapid succession<br />
2. The spell is meant to dispel, not heal. It's a gimmick heal and meant to be a gimmick heal.</div></div><hr />

Outside of times when the server has shut down while raiding, I cannot remember anything remotely that bad. <br />
Several of us were running at what seemed like 1 frame every ten seconds... <br />
Many times we had him turn (no aggro issues with the tank he was so far above the raid with MDs and Tricks it's not even funny) and breath on the entire raid...<br />
We finally gave up and went to Naxx, no problems there at all.<br />
But the lag issues in general since launch of LK have been ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

You make valid points, however whether it's 6 or 3%, it's still a gimmick heal; 6% of 20k health (example) is 1200 HPs, it's not much. Admittedly, Dispel has no cooldown other than GCD so you can spam it to no end and it'll keep healing as long as a harmful spell is dispelled. Perhaps it should simply have a limit on the healing portion granted by the glyph (will not heal more than once every 10 seconds, for example).<br />
<br />
I'm having a tough time justifying the nerf to a so-called gimmick heal; herbalism's free &quot;gimmick&quot; heal does more than that at artisan level (300 skill level).</div></div><hr />

If this was in fact the case, the s1 armor set in BC wouldn't have looked so hot either, somewat like the dungeon sets. I think many of you will agree that t4/s1 armor looked pretty darn good in most cases. But nono, these s5 gear models look like absolute shit, the devs don't wanna admit it or apologize in any way...they just spoonfeed us some garbage answer using dragon nipples.<br />

And they're trying to not only not take responsilbility for their laziness, but they're trying to go one step further and say that PVP/Arena armors aren't supposed to really look all that good. Huh?

You're a fucking moron. In BC they didn't do ANY work on PVP sets, they just recolored the PVE Tier. The change to actually make different looking arena sets was the best thing Blizz ever came up with.<br />

<br />
http://portableapps.com/apps/internet/firefox_portable<br />
<br />
You can install it to a USB drive or a folder on your desktop regardless of permission (you can also install all the nice addons like NoScript and Speed Dial). I use this at University and it works like a charm, best done on a machine at home, since you'll probably need to install flash as well.<br />
<br />
As to the armor sets, I am taking a wait and see approach, in general I found while leveling (still am) that there are pieces that look absolutely awesome and others that I don't like as much, TBC didn't sway me to hate/love as intensely as the armor designs in WOTLK do... but I will wait and see... the warrior PvE gear looks pretty cool to me...</div></div><hr />

<br />
i think eventually ppl will have had their fun and go back to healing specs and eventually it will become a bit more stable. hopefully.</div></div><hr />

It's a quote from the European forums. American English is the only one who spells it with a 'z'.<br />
<br />
Egg of Mortal Essence (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40685) not procing from Healing Stream Totem<br />
It won't proc off of items and Healing Stream is a totem. Bad things would happen if it proc'd off of items.<br />
<br />
It should work fine with all your other heals. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13593871538-egg-of-mortal-essence--healing-stream-broken.html))<br />
<br />
Jesus this thread was painful to read. Are there really that many people who don't understand that Healing Stream Totem isn't a heal spell? <br />
Though GC did manage to set the stage for a cripple fight by running his explanation of why it doesn't proc trinkets through Babelfish several times.</div></div><hr />
