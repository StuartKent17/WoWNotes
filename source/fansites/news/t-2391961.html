In battle.net balance...<br />
<br />
Pretty sure the boosters, don't want money that they can only spend on Blizzard products.<br />
&quot;Hell yes we'll camp BMAH spots across a multitude of servers thus killing normal players' chances of ever getting a bid in, to get you the Zulian tiger for 2000 euros, but please pay us in Battle.net balance lol!&quot;... <br />
<br />
Like, really?<br />

There are many ways to work around it, they can turn that balance into gold from tokens and then sell that gold.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2018-04-20, 12:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You can't however send someone battle.net balance from your account to someone else. You have to actually use real money for this. I'm sure there are limitations like always, you can't gift someone outside of US or whatever because of laws and regulations. It's basically the same issue as redeeming a wow token for balance if you're not a US citizen.</div></div><hr />
