<br />
Rune of Razorice now correctly increases the damage of some previously unaffected Frost abilities.<br />
Unholy<br />
<br />
Clawing Shadows damage has been changed to 130% weapon damage (was 150% Attack Power) and now requires facing the target.<br />
<br />

<br />
Havoc<br />
<br />
Demon Blades now generates 12-20 Fury (was 15-20).<br />
<br />

<br />
Balance<br />
<br />
Blessing of Elune now increases Astral Power generation by 25% (was 40%).<br />
Blessing of An'she now grants 2 Astral Power every 3 seconds (was 2 Astral Power every 2.5 seconds).<br />
Lunar Strike now generates 12 Astral Power (was 10).<br />
Mastery: Starlight bonus has been increased to 2%/point (was 1.75%).<br />
Moonfire and Sunfire DoT damage has been decreased to 50% per tick (was 55%).<br />
Shooting Stars gives 4 Astral Power (was 5).<br />
Solar Wrath now generates 8 Astral Power (was 6).<br />
Developer's Note: We shifted some Astral Power generation from the level 90 talent row into the baseline spec. This both improves gameplay sub level 90 and reduces reliance on these talents at max level.<br />
<br />

Cinderstorm will no longer consume additional stacks of Ice Floes when damage occurs.<br />
Fire Mage critical strike chance has been increased by 5%.<br />
Critical Mass multiplier has been decreased to 1.1 (was 1.3).<br />
Developer's Note: We shifted some critical strike chance from a multiplier on gear to a flat bonus. This brings the value of critical strike for Fire closer to other stats and also limits the very high amounts of critical strike chance that can be reached with certain gear.<br />

Deadly Poison instant damage has been increased to 17% Attack Power (was 14.2%).<br />
Rupture damage has been decreased to 25% Attack Power (was 30%).<br />
Agonizing Poison now stacks 5 times (was 4).<br />
Developer's Note: We shifted some damage from Rupture into poison affects to increase the significance of poisons in the rotation and help poison-oriented talents better compete with bleed-oriented talents.<br />

Yeah that's what I meant. I'm amazed that people somehow hate momentum so much they'd rather take a garbage talent that involves auto attacking half the time but then again most people pick all the passives in a spec and then go &quot;waaaah everyone else is doing more damage than me boo hoo&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait, what? You make no sense. If you are not interested in organized raiding or Mythic+ dungeons, you have all the reasons to start playing as it launches, because you've got everything unlocked except LFR (which opens at the same time as Mythic raids). The only reason LFR opens later than normal is so people don't &quot;cheat&quot; by getting easy upgrade right before going in normal or heroic. The other thing, the gated opening, is to make sure a raid that normally would have you progress for a month or two doesn't get cleared in LFR in an hour, that's all.<br />
<br />
By playing Legion on the day it launches, it allows:<br />
<br />
-Leveling experience, which is amazing this time around<br />
-Professions, with quests which are tied to the leveling experience<br />
-Dungeons, normal and heroic<br />
-Suramar at 110<br />
-Artifact unlocking and leveling<br />
-Class hall and Campaign story which is really cool when you reach the end (story unique to your class)<br />
-World Quest with rewards that can be better than LFR<br />
<br />
&quot;there is zero point to subbing for Legion until a month after release&quot; - bullshit<br />
<br />
Now, if you said: Since I'm only interested in logging in for LFR and logging off and paying 15$ a month for only that, yes, you are right, there's zero point. But I would add there's never been a point to ever play WoW if that's all you do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EU will get it on Wed the 31st, US on Wed the 30th, this was only done to prevent the leveling rush into doing 2 Mythic dungeons next week for EU (they get the expac 9 hrs before the US and therefore, if leveled fast enough, could get a mythic run in before their reset on wed) It just levels the playing field out on number mythics post launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, no, it's not. Yeah, you could sub a month later. But those ppl playing LFR are mostly those with the lowest time for wow. Like myself - I have quite the active RL but I don't wanna miss WoW and like to play it. I can only do LFR, because I can't stick to a set raid schedule even on a loose group. If I have the time to raid, I need LFR, because the invite time can be like 10 min. and I can start with it.<br />
<br />

Just three quick quests, Go to Dal (1), Clear some arcane stuff (2), summon a lore figure (3). Takes like 5 min, but its 5 min to get done before launch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RoKPaNda</div><div class="date">2016-08-23, 06:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait, what? You make no sense. If you are not interested in organized raiding or Mythic+ dungeons, you have all the reasons to start playing as it launches, because you've got everything unlocked except LFR (which opens at the same time as Mythic raids). The only reason LFR opens later than normal is so people don't &quot;cheat&quot; by getting easy upgrade right before going in normal or heroic. The other thing, the gated opening, is to make sure a raid that normally would have you progress for a month or two doesn't get cleared in LFR in an hour, that's all.<br />
<br />
By playing Legion on the day it launches, it allows:<br />
<br />
-Leveling experience, which is amazing this time around<br />
-Professions, with quests which are tied to the leveling experience<br />
-Dungeons, normal and heroic<br />
-Suramar at 110<br />
-Artifact unlocking and leveling<br />
-Class hall and Campaign story which is really cool when you reach the end (story unique to your class)<br />
-World Quest with rewards that can be better than LFR<br />
<br />
&quot;there is zero point to subbing for Legion until a month after release&quot; - bullshit<br />
<br />
Now, if you said: Since I'm only interested in logging in for LFR and logging off and paying 15$ a month for only that, yes, you are right, there's zero point. But I would add there's never been a point to ever play WoW if that's all you do.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but you're wrong. You get those things regardless of when you sub. You're still going to do the leveling content, professions, etc. The only thing you'll miss out on is some Artifact grinding, but if you're an average player that doesn't matter. If you're an average player you're not going to grind that bullshit incessantly anyway. Still going to do the class hall and campaign story stuff and world quests. But since you can't even get to the end game for average players until a month after the game launches / finish it until a month after that, why would you EVER pay for those months sub time? For five mans? Nah. At any point after LFR launches, whether it's just the first wing or it's the second wing or whatever, I'll spend however many hours leveling, jump into some five mans, and then run LFR and explore the world. Pay them $30 for no end-game while the hardcore raiders pay them that same $30 and get their end game? Fuuuuuuck that. Make LFR share a lockout with Normal/Heroic/Mythic so that the idiots in abusive guilds won't feel forced to run it and release it at the same time as everyone else, don't penalize the average player for having better shit to do than plan their schedule every week around raid time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anything is better than autoattack demon hunters<br />
<br />
I just treated demon blades as a passive generator like a rogue, but you use more than one skill.<br />
<br />
I don't like spamming demon bite while having to fel rush and vengeful retreating on CD, if we didn't have to do that dumbass shit to DPS properly, i wouldn't mind demon blade being worse, but currently, prepared is the only real option now, especially when combined with momentum and fel mastery.<br />
<br />
I prefer demonic appetite, but having to pick up orbs manually in a raid is stupid, and even picking them up on CD, it still sims quite a bit below prepared and demon blades.<br />

<br />
But this whole Khadgar quest-chain has been a total mess and a huge let-down compared to everything else. The first potion had a lot of great text and lore, but no voice-over and was not using the new dialogue system from Legion so I had to frantically read it in the chat window and most of the text simply went by too fast for me to keep up.<br />
<br />
And then you decided to split the quest-chain, for what exactly? The last &quot;portion&quot; we got today was nothing. It was a tiny, non-engaging quest doing nothing at all. Then we get a few seconds with more text without voice-over to read in the chat and that's it. Why split the quest-chain like this at all when the last portion is done within 2-minutes?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RamGuy</div><div class="date">2016-08-23, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As one who have enjoyed playing a Demon Hunter a lot, it's sad to see the nerf to Demon Blades. I do understand why Blizzard want to avoid Demon Blades to be the best choice for maximum DPS as many players will feel it really dumb and lacklustre to be &quot;forced&quot; into picking a talent that actually makes Havoc Demon Hunters less &quot;active&quot; to play.<br />
<br />
The talent has always been a rather awkward one, as it encourages the player to be less active during fights. But I for one did enjoy it a whole lot. I don't think the endless spamming of a single ability, in this case &quot;Demon's Bite&quot; is anything special and I do certainly not find it anything more engaging than simply using &quot;Demon Blades&quot; as Demon Blades at least gives me the opportunity to keep my focus elsewhere without me having to keep mashing that one button on the keyboard for no other reason that it has to be pushed in order for my rotation to function.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many will argue that such a awkward talent should never be the most popular option in that talent tier. And I wholeheartedly agree. But I don't think this nerf is doing it any good, not at all. Now Demon Blades are pretty much reduced into not being a valid pick at all. With this nerf &quot;Prepared&quot; becomes to clear choice in terms of DPS, especially when you take into consideration &quot;Momentum&quot; which you unlock on level 106. There is no way you, as a Demon Hunter can still chose the Demon Blades talent and still be viable when it comes to DPS performance.<br />
<br />
And that's just wrong if you ask me. The various options should be pretty much equal in terms of DPS potential so it's up to the players to choose whatever fits their playstyle the most. The game should not punish you because you enjoy the more passive gamestyle that Demon Blades offer. If Blizzard feels that Demon Blades need to be inferior do to its nature, then it should not be a talent to begin with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talents should be balanced in terms of DPS potential, or be so unique compared to each other that they give distinct advantages in certain situations that players will be switching them up on the get-go depending on whatever content they are about to tackle within the game. But that's not the case here, with this nerf Demon Blades it no longer a viable option as Prepared is simply superior in every possible way in terms of DPS potential and Demon Blades does not bring any advantages compared to it, none at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a really awkward decision for Blizzard to make as well. Because it pretty much forces players that might have enjoyed Demon Hunters because of the more passive playstyle that Demon Blades offered into picking a talent that is the polar opposite. Prepared makes you bounce around all-over-the-place and it a really active talent compared to Demon Blades.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know why they nerfed in the first place? Prepared was still a viable option, it was not like Demon Blades was vastly superior to it? Especially combined with Momentum at level 106 Demon Blades was not always considered to be the optimal choice to begin with. Now they've simply reduced it into not being a real choice for anyone that wants to be anywhere close to their class DPS potential.</div></div><hr />

I fell into this group most of WoD although for the most part a.) I used gold for time since I had a ridiculous amount of gold and b.) I was unsubbed for something like 6-8 months because I got bored.<br />
<br />
It's not &quot;just&quot; LFR so much as I knew that this might be my last chance to rack up a shit ton of gold for Legion. If Legion doesn't work out then I'm done with WoW but by investing this mild amount of time I hope to make my Legion experience that much better.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I liked the days where they gave us the raids without holding on to it for no reason. The 2 week bullshit was actually nice cause it gave us time to relax and level slowly and have some 5 man end game for a bit but 3 weeks is fucking pushing it. That's far too long.</div></div><hr />

Someone says &quot;You can't handle a 2 button rotation&quot;. Clearly, you have not played a DH at 110. At 110 you are so busy hitting spenders that not having to hit a filler is an AWESOME thing. Unfortunately, as you can see, a little too awesome. And yeah, I assure you spenders will take up most of your GCDs at 110 (or at least did prior to this nerf). Between fel rush, fel blade, vengeful retreat, blade dance, eye beam, fel barrage, chaos strike, and throw glaive if you have a gcd to waste.

<br />
I'm not sure I currently see the logic behind this.<br />
<br />
Check the math out - it's actually not bad. If anything, we got buffed.<br />
<br />
Blessing of Elune now increases Astral Power generation by 25% (was 40%).<br />
<br />
Spenders have had a buff on AsP given so that compensates for the loss from BoE<br />
e.g. Lunar strike -- old 10 AsP + 40% bonus from talent = 14 AsP per cast. NEW is 12 AsP + 25% bonus from talent = 15 AsP per cast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blessing of An'she now grants 2 Astral Power every 3 seconds (was 2 Astral Power every 2.5 seconds).<br />
<br />
This kind of is a nerf but we do not use this over huge amounts of time for it to &quot;hurt&quot; enough.<br />
<br />
Lunar Strike now generates 12 Astral Power (was 10).<br />
Mastery: Starlight bonus has been increased to 2%/point (was 1.75%).<br />
<br />
Mastery is weak, yes, but this is still abit of a buff.<br />
<br />
Moonfire and Sunfire DoT damage has been decreased to 50% per tick (was 55%).<br />
<br />
Moonfire / Sunfire was simmed at roughly 15% of our damage.. 5 % is very small. Likely with the mastery buff it will lower the gap from 55 - 50.<br />
<br />
Shooting Stars gives 4 Astral Power (was 5).<br />
<br />
This was incredible already on long living multi-target fights. <br />
<br />
Solar Wrath now generates 8 Astral Power (was 6).<br />
<br />
BUff. <br />
<br />
Developer's Note: We shifted some Astral Power generation from the level 90 talent row into the baseline spec. This both improves gameplay sub level 90 and reduces reliance on these talents at max level.</div></div><hr />

-Class hall and Campaign story which is really cool when you reach the end (story unique to your class)<br />
-World Quest with rewards that can be better than LFR<br />
<br />
&quot;there is zero point to subbing for Legion until a month after release&quot; - bullshit<br />
<br />
Now, if you said: Since I'm only interested in logging in for LFR and logging off and paying 15$ a month for only that, yes, you are right, there's zero point. But I would add there's never been a point to ever play WoW if that's all you do.<br />
<br />
what you will also get that you deliberately missed is :<br />
<br />
-no flying<br />
-huge server ques making game unplayable for first couple of weeks on high pop servers<br />
-shitton of bugs not fixed in beta<br />
-no lfr <br />
<br />
+ all those things you listed will be there in future so for causal players theres no point subbing untill blizzard puts in essential things like flying and lfr and fixes bugs - 7.1 which probably will come in december will be quite a sweet spot to resub</div></div><hr />

I have better idea! Resub 10 years from now:<br />
<br />
+many more content avaiable<br />
+you dont even have do LFR, you can SOLO stuff! perfect for causal players!<br />
+flying, flying everywhere!<br />
+there is even possibility that WoW will be B2P till then<br />
<br />
and most important, we don't have to see you for very long time! (because you leave forum also, right? it's not very causal to whine about game that you're not playing on fansites)</div></div><hr />

yea, im still waiting for more smaller raids in one tier for diversity purposes, so far I see one raid, one &quot;smaller&quot; raid (aka 1-2 bosses), then its all irrelevant, one delayed tier raid and then one more raid (probably final if 1st raid is tier raid), so the same we got in WoD</div></div><hr />

Emerald nightmare is not a raid tier and will be the 1st raid introduced. 7.1 will introduce Karazhan which is a 5 man dungeon as well as a 9 boss raid. The Nighthold, which will be the 3rd raid, is the 1st tier raid in Legion. That will most likely just be the beginning, no way will they make Gul'dan the end boss of Legion.</div></div><hr />

Why do i see no effort to balance the first tier? Not picking fel rush talent and using fel rush on CD is a 10% dps loss over other talent choices, which is fucking huge, i mean really fucking huge.

wow...<br />
<br />
-no flying? Really? Still beating that dead horse? It's not something you should expect in 2016, maybe even in 2017. It's also has NOTHING to do with raid schedule, flying was known to be absent since the day it was announced. You can still hate it, but you know where the door is.<br />
<br />

Also, this AGAIN, has nothing to do with raid schedule and what content there is in the game. You yet again just spew your bullshit arguments to blindly hate a game you are clearly simply addicted to and can't move on.<br />
<br />
-shit ton of bugs were fixed in beta, there are still some around, and there will always be, this is no different to other expansions or any other game from any other company for that matter. Again, nothing to do with whether you are raiding and mythic dungeoning or not. Again, just blind hate.<br />

This. Gating LFR isn't a big deal to me, but it is stupid. <br />
<br />
Kinda hard to swallow &quot;easy upgrades&quot; as an excuse considering how infrequently anything even drops from the bosses. You can do the entirety of LFR and get nothing but runes, and in my experience, that's generally how it goes. I mean, apparently runes are something to get excited over (LOL), but still, it's dragging out content for the sake of dragging out content, and exactly zero people will be fooled by it.<br />
<br />
Every time I don't see changes to BM I feel mixed about it. It's probably the most boring spec I have out of 11 characters, but at the same time, at this stage of things its probably better to NOT see your class/spec listed for fear over knee-jerk nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And? There's 3 talents per row, is possible to have different playstyles in a single spec, i don't care that the playstyle exists, but that we're forced into it, it's mostly the first row honestly, fel mastery is so poorly tuned, it's miles ahead of the other options except on a cleave fight where there will always be targets, and even then, it's only a tiny bit behind (Spoiler, there's no fights with two targets up all the time)<br />
<br />
Momentum isn't far ahead, it's much more reasonably balanced, but not picking fel mastery in the first tier is a minimum 10% dps loss.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heck, since DH's only have a single DPS spec, i would have thought they'd have wanted different playstyles being possible.</div></div><hr />

It's a shitty feeling to see a boss for the first time in LFR. Reduces the enjoyment of progressing through heroic or normal or whatever.

Flying is only essentially if Blizzard has to balance the game world around it. Since they don't, it isn't essential. You just want it. It was horrible for the game and there is a reason no other major MMO has touched the idea of flying after Blizzard put it in. Was probably the biggest mistake they ever made. Just be happy they caved and didn't remove it from future expansions entirely. The current set up is a perfect balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why wait for LFR to open, Mythic dungeons will be open from the start and since they admitted they're no harder than previous heroics it is good end-game content for casuals. I'm really excited that I'll get my progression since I can't play on a schedule anymore.<br />
LFR dropping tier sets is also awesome for hoarding casuals like me since while I don't care about the power of the set I do like to collect them and it's fun to be able to play with the mechanics changes the set bonuses give (a reason why I do not like them disabling old tier set bonuses). While it's going to be annoying that instead of having the best version of the set in void storage I'll have the crappiest one, it will have to do.<br />
<br />
As I see it now there doesn't seem to be any exclusive content. Anyone should be able to finish base Mythic 5 mans. Sure it will not be fast but with care &amp; playing carefully and using CC they should be really simple. Looking at WoD mythics they are really easy, I mean compared to TBC heroics like shattered halls they're nothing.<br />
<br />
One more thing Blizzard should do is add LFG to all raid versions, even Mythic. This way even the people that consider anything not on LFG as exclusive can enjoy all versions of raids. I wish them 'Have fun hugging the floor!'.</div></div><hr />

The Nighthold, which will be the 3rd raid, is the 1st tier raid in Legion. That will most likely just be the beginning, no way will they make Gul'dan the end boss of Legion.<br />
im just saying that:<br />
<br />
Emerald Nightmare = Highmaul<br />
Kara 5man &quot;raid&quot; is promising + &quot;small&quot; raid as filler (probably 1-2 bosses), miles better than 6.1 for sure, lol<br />
Nighthold = delayed BRF, first tier raid<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
Suramar = HFC, second tier raid<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
They already stated they want to make more smaller raids in one raid tier for diversity purposes so you dont have to look at 13 orc-like creatures (red/orange fire and dark design) in 1st tier and then at another 13 fel-orc-like creatures (green fire and dark design). This is still missing. <br />
<br />
This raid schedule is already crap like WoD, sure it gives more 5man content but it still devours its own content with every raid unlocked. I bet Nighthold will have AGAIN 20% better loot than Emerald Nightmare, thats just retarded imo. Normal Nighthold gear should be atleast worse than heroic Emeral Nightmare gear, but i doubt that. They proved they have no idea how to balance ilvls so the minute we progress last boss of first raid they release second raid we jump into normal because of gear and tier tokens...stupid.<br />
<br />
I also seriously doubt they will release more than 1 solid raid after Suramar (but I hope I am wrong, I really do hope so). <br />
<br />
If they released Emerald Nightmare + Nighthold at the same time with tier tokens equally spread we would have really nice amount of content available and diversity goal achieved. + 7.1 with kara dungeon and smaller raid, would be amazing imo.<br />
<br />
then we should have Suramar+another raid as 2nd tier and after that some 7.3 with atleast 2 dungeons or something of similar size <br />
then 7.4 with final raid tier (could be just one huge raid but not green-fel shit like HFC but something interesting like Ulduar was graphically)<br />
also 7.5 to avoid content drought (I know, lol)<br />
<br />
Buuut no, we will do irrelevant Emerald Nightmare on billions of difficulties for 3-4 months atleast, then Nighthold for 5 months, then Suramar (not sooner than end of may/beginning of june 2016) and then the last raid probably at the end of 2016, never stepping into previous raids again. I just dont want to look at same shit for months every single stupid raid night...its retarded and there is no reason for it. &quot;More smaller raids in one raid tier, for diversity&quot;...yeah, atm its BS by looking at this schedule.</div></div><hr />
