Stay tuned on MMO-Champion for the upcoming patch notes and changes. We're not sure about what's in this patch and it's still unsure if it will be a bug fix patch or if it will include more changes, this is probably the last patch before WotLK and Blizzard might have a few surprises in it.  
Yes the 2.4.3 PTR is coming soon. The forums were opened a little early and I would appreciate it if nobody spammed it before the realms are up.

I would advise anyone who is going to particiapte in the 2.4.3 PTR to delete their old WOWtest folder now so that you have no problems with the new install.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me have serious doubts about that:<br />
- On the best case WotLK would be released in December (see Activision Blizzard year schedule or Season 4 duration)<br />
- Still lack a patch containing Brewfest (Kodo Mount!!!) and prolly will be closer to its date<br />
- It was said that there could be up to 2 minor content patches after 2.4 and before WotLK<br />
- AoC is growing and maybe Blizzard would not like to have no new content for keeping some players still on WoW<br />
- Last content was added in March 25th and is already &quot;completed&quot;, 9 moths without updating content is maybe too much at this point<br />
- Where in hell are Turalyon and Alleria??? No, seriously, they were supposed to be in Outlands and nobody cares we haven't found them?<br />
<br />
My guess?<br />
This is a patch for activating the new Summer event and maybe some fix regarding season 4 (Vengeful Nether Drake model is similar to s1 one in current patch)... but it's just an opinion.</div></div><hr />
