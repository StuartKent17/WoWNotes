<br />
Summoned by Gul'dan from the depths of the Twisting Nether, Xhul'horac is one of most powerful of the Void Revenants - a race of parasitic void-beings that tear holes through the planes of reality, consuming and absorbing the energies and beings within. Gul'dan has twisted Xhul'horac, feeding him overwhelming Fel energy, and using his powers to tear open the portals through which he plans to rally the forces of the Burning Legion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - Two portals dominate Xhul'horac's room: one powered by void, and one by the Legion's fel magic. Xhul'horac activates the Fel portal first, granting him fel abilities and summoning first Imps and then Vanguard Akkelion. When Akkelion dies, Xhul'horac activates the void portal, granting him void abilities and summoning Unstable Voidfiends and then Omnus. Once Omnus is defeated, Xhul'horac gains the energy of both fel and void, rapidly switching between elements. Once he reaches 20% health, he completely absorbs the power of both portals and must be quickly defeated.<br />

Flying<br />
We have to make a lot of decisions when it comes to building and maintaining such a massive world that's near and dear to so many people. We always try to do what's best for the game, all the while listening to how the community is responding along the way. In some situations our point of view shifts as we share in discourse with players. It's all case by case, and at no point is it implied that we're going to design by democracy rather than follow our own collaborative expertise and instincts. But, to put it in motivational poster terms...<br />
<br />
&quot;Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything.&quot;<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is because pro-flight couldn't change their minds, you gave up on progressing the game for the better with your development mindset of experiencing the content from the ground floor? Pro-flight destroyed this game going forward. Got it. Thanks.<br />
For years now I've found it to be a such a strange honor to be followed around the internet by expert interpreters, who take plain words in English and replace them with other, more loaded words in English.<br />
<br />
Whenever I read a reply to me that starts with, &quot;So what you're saying is...&quot; -- and I've read so, so many -- my first thought is, &quot;What I'm saying is what I'm saying, otherwise I would've said something else.&quot;<br />
<br />
Forums ≠ Community. 7 Million people play this game. Not many people look at the US Forums/3rd party websites nor even know there is a flying argument going on. The people who don't look at the Forums/3rd party websites may have a entirely different view about flying, but simply don't respond.<br />
You're absolutely right! The listening and discourse extends far beyond the forums, fansites, and social media.<br />
<br />
I think they did it to feed the lions before the dev guy does the q&amp;a on Saturday.<br />
Not exactly. We wanted to lock in our decision before hosting the Q&amp;A, because a lot of people were clearly tired of wishy-washy answers on the subject.<br />
<br />
Who wouldn't be exactly? sounds like you guys were forced into making the blog when it should have just been a standard of business practice to clearly communicate solid answers<br />
That's an awesome ideal to which we always aspire. But we're also not a hive mind over here. We grappled with the topic as well. And from the beginning we tried to make it clear to the community that we didn't have a final answer -- we were discussing it with the community, as well as internally. We wanted this to be known; but when a clear answer took us too long to supply many people spun it as us kicking the can down the road, or stringing players along.<br />
<br />
It has definitely been a learning experience for us. Proof of our infallibility remains elusive! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/376577-blizzardyou-have-no-spine-whatsoever/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18000145181?page=6#113))<br />

We won't get flying after we've completed the requirements for it. We will get flying when they put in the patch if we've completed the requirements for it. Blizzard can still take their time about putting flying into current content, and they can still string people along for their subs until then.<br />
The reality is that we don't think it's good for anyone for us to delay Patch 6.2 further to implement this. When it comes to building, testing, and deploying patches, such a change this late in the PTR cycle is far from trivial. More broadly, it's very much a fact that, in a world of production processes and development pipelines, results on a change in design decision like this can't be immediate.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you believe this to be truthful is inconsequential. We've explained to the community our change in decision and how we'll go about implementing that change, purely to update everyone and inform you.

Ghostcrawler<br />
So when exactly is blizzard going to go crawling to Ghostcrawler and beg him to work for them again?<br />
I mean just look at the nosedive the game took after the great ones depature<br />
I miss him as a colleague and friend. But he'd also be among the first to tell you that the design process for World of Warcraft is very much collaborative, and that he got most of the attention (good or bad) because of his public presence.<br />
<br />
The WoW development team numbers in the hundreds, but only a very small handful are spokespeople plucked for interviews or other public-facing discussions.<br />
<br />
People like to paint this picture of Ghostcrawler as once steering the great ship that is World of Warcraft, and Watcher taking the wheel in the wake of his departure. The perception just doesn't match the reality. Both of these gentlemen have spoken on behalf of many designers, but that doesn't mean it has been their individual visions being brought to fruition by the rest of the team.<br />
<br />
So, you're a collective? Lead designer doesn't really do anything more than bring &quot;order to chaos.&quot;. He doesn't actually guide th ship?<br />
Well, no, it's not a development commune either. There are multiple positions with varying levels of responsibility, and developers, or teams of developers, reporting to other developers in a tiered structure.<br />
<br />
And there are many lead designers (Greg was a lead designer; Ion is a lead designer). They lead teams like the UI team, software engineering team, class/systems design team, dungeon design team, quest design team, etc.<br />
<br />
Using the art team as an example, you have artists and senior artists in each discipline. Then you have leads to whom the individuals on each art team report, such as the lead environment artist, lead character artist, lead dungeon artist, lead concept artist, lead animator, lead prop artist, lead level designer, etc. Overseeing all of these artists is the art director. (Side note: I shared brief, but delightful small talk with art director Chris Robinson in the elevator today. He's a good dude.)<br />
<br />
The same is true for the development team as a whole, with Tom Chilton as the game director and J. Allen Brack as the production director.<br />
<br />
In the most basic of terms -- not basic for your sake, but for my own -- the design teams work together to figure out what they want to do, and the production teams help ensure developers stay coordinated, as well as manage tasks by priority and enforce deadlines. And, during this part of the process, the community team acts in an advisory role to ensure that community feedback is taken into account along the way.<br />
<br />
Some things that may seem very simple from an outsider perspective may entail much more complicated work. A designer wants to implement X. Does it need new tech from our software engineers? Does it need new UI elements? Does it need new artwork? Will X need new localization strings for each language version of the game? Is it going to interfere with, or break, something else in the game? If the answer's &quot;yes&quot; to any of those, do the appropriate designers have time to work on it now, or are they already tasked with higher-priority assignments? Producers help sort all of that out and, depending on the situation, assign a milestone accordingly (i.e. for 6.1, 6.2, 6.2.x, etc. development cycles).<br />
<br />
At some point, after countless hours of work by hundreds of people, long days, much coffee, and many internal test builds of the game, we prepare to deploy a patch like 6.2. That's around the time that Ion Hazzikostas, Cory Stockton, Dave Kosak, and some of the other leads sit down with press and fansites to talk about 6.2. That's around the time that we publish numerous articles and statements about the new content or evolving design, or to go into further depth about the philosophies behind the new content or evolving design. That's around the time some people latch onto the names of those lead designers and either credit them, or fault them, for just about everything.<br />
<br />
It's a big game and a complicated process. We don't get everything right, whether it be in design or communications. But, as someone who gets to see the inner workings everyday, I can tell you that it's a grand machine, finely oiled by the blood, sweat, and tears of all the people working here.<br />
<br />
Unless I'm misreading it, Watcher has the same position the Ghostrcrawler did: Lead Designer. And there are many lead designers (Greg was a lead designer; Ion is a lead designer).<br />
In many ways, yes. A while back Ion's title changed from lead encounter designer to lead game designer, because he does a lot more than just oversee what the encounter design team is creating.

<br />
Developer Communication and Twitter<br />
Is 140 characters at a time the new attention span of the audience or the developers?<br />
Your question only took 88 characters so you can judge for yourself.<br />
<br />
They had attempted to communicate with Twitter because it was faster<br />
Partially this...<br />
<br />
I think 140 characters is a good way to force people to get to the point<br />
Partially this except &quot;encourage&quot; is a better word.<br />
<br />
Twitter is another avenue in which we can promote the game, provide updates, and respond to folks. Yes, the shorter format is often helpful, but it can also be ignored and thus we tend to get long rants broken up into several tweets. My team and I sift through them every day and communicate them to developers who provide us with insights and answers. Where appropriate, we respond and make sure to also post them here on the forums for those who would rather get information from our site than from Twitter. Win win!

Classes<br />
I always felt like so much WoW flavor/fun was lost/removed in the name of balance, yet very little long-term gain.<br />
It caused a lot of player pain though. Players complain to this day about being sat because they don't bring enough to groups. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/606458509832515584))<br />
I agree, but I guess my point is: do they complain less today than they did back then? If not, what was truly gained?<br />
I think it's cynical to think that you can't truly address player concerns. Totally agree that the cost you mention is real. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/606501932300009474))<br />

Class quests are cool. They were originally designed to be challenging. Are they worth it if they are easy? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/606502538330800129))<br />
I guess I am arguing that questing and leveling evolved over time and maybe class quests couldn't keep up. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/606502617301184512))<br />

do you think talent trees/tiers are a dated system that does more bad than good in mp games? (ie balance or false choice)<br />
It is very hard to deliver on the promise of customization. Too easy to solve them. League masteries are a great example. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/607024101715120128))<br />
is that the sort of customization players these days want? Or does is line up more with transmogs/skins/aesthetics?<br />
I think they do enjoy tweaking out characters for actual benefit. The internet is full of it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/607316606851518464))<br />
In some ways, that's the problem. Players enjoy it so much that they dedicate a whole lot of resources to it, and solve it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/607316725894242305))<br />

The helmet and shoulder models are different for Mythic and Elite from the rest, which is basically what they did with the previous tier and season. The only difference is that in the previous tier, the PVP sets had different helmets and shoulders from the raid sets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The warrior tier looks fine. <br />
<br />
Warlock looks fine, DK looks fine, Rogue looks fine, Shaman looks fine, Mage looks fine.<br />
<br />
The paladin one only looks weird because the shoulders point outwards; priest would look fine if the wings were BEHIND their shoulders, and druid looks fine, if a little generic in the robe. The monk looks okay for the style they were aiming for. <br />
<br />
<br />
The only ones I'd say looks &quot;bad&quot; is the hunter one (very unimpressive.) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only issue I have is with the color palette for them overall. Except for maybe... the monk, druid, and rogue one, all of the other sets have color palettes that are way too specific and can't be mixed-and-matched easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The rest are either extremely bland or simply ugly. <br />
<br />
Sometimes I wonder if designing tier sets around the expansion's theme is such a good idea. From MoP's rice hats to WoD's furry bonanza, I'm just not sure that I like the approach. In my opinion, it would be better if individual sets for the different classes received their inspiration from different sources. Tier 17 did this to a degree, but I think it could be taken even further. Let the warlock set be an investigation into the plot line of the Twisting Nether and the Burning Legion, from Tier 17 to Tier 18 there could be a natural development of the set looks. Have the hunter sets look into the savage factor of Draenor's fauna, but then let it evolve into something more nuanced. There's the great beasts of Nagrand, the ferocious cats of wherever, we have the dinosaurs, and the Gronn, and what not. Having the Paladin T17 based around the draenei was really cool - why not incorporate elements of duty and justice into T18, building atop the draenei theme there could be parts of the set that looks salvaged from the Second War; Quel'dorei or human symbolism depending on your faction, etc.</div></div><hr />

Precisely what I was thinking. Love the helmet, but the rest is just bland.<br />

Also, the class logos at the top look cooler than the sets. Build a set off of those logos!<br />

Rogue set, however, looks awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they did it to feed the lions before the dev guy does the q&amp;a on Saturday.<br />
Not exactly. We wanted to lock in our decision before hosting the Q&amp;A, because a lot of people were clearly tired of wishy-washy answers on the subject.<br />
<br />
This is true, but the bigger issue is one of your devs made a definitive statement in an interview that sparked the firestorm, that wasn't wishy washy in any way. If we believed Ion, there was no &quot;decision&quot; or &quot;discussion&quot; necessary, the decision had been made. &quot;we're not adding flying to World of Dreanor&quot; is not a wishy washy statement. That's not wishy washy, that's simply a MAJOR error in judgement, or a lie. In fact, since Bashiok's quest for flying comments before 6.1, there's been no discussion of the issue at all, and the players had no clue the issue was up for discussion, or even negotiable. Your defending his comments on Twitter and in your own forums solidified that it was a done deal. That's not wishy washy, in any definition of the term. <br />
<br />
Coupled with your comments about being able to change one's mind, I think I have an idea of what was happening here, and if true, and you're taking steps to address it internally, it's a good thing - but you should never have to learn you need to address it this way ever again. This issue caused massive amounts of damage in the faith and trust of players, and it's going to be a steep uphill climb to get that back. But, that you're still dissembling and spinning it is not a good sign. <br />
<br />
All of this could have been avoided, this entire episode was your fault. No amount of snotty comments on Twitter will change that - you need to show a LOT more humility if you expect to earn back the respect of your customers. <br />
<br />
I think it's time to open up the Scrooge McDuck money vault down there in Irvine, and hire someone who's only job is to talk about the game to the press, and work with the CMs and devs to develop a cohesive and *accurate* narrative for your product.</div></div><hr />

Rarely, so I am okay with them taking small shortcuts like that to get content faster.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2015-06-12, 01:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's the thing about the tier sets. There's a high level of polish to them, they're very intricate, but they're blocky and awkward and just unappealing. If you want to see them in action, log onto the PTR with a level 100, you can buy them in SW from a giant Tauren in a tophat. <br />
<br />
The two sets I lived with for a while were the Rogue and the Paladin sets. The rogue set has some nice elements, they're going away from mirror image, like with the slanted knives on the belt, but the shoulders are like a fender of economy car. No animation on the shoulders, from what I recall. It's not bad, but it's not great.<br />
<br />
The Paladin set is crap. Clunky, bulky, no finesse or style or elegance to it at all. The shoulders...oh, god, the shoulders...see those &quot;wings&quot; on them? They move up and down, slowly. Like an electric can opener. It's *stupid*. Really, really, really fucking stupid. <br />
<br />
The helms, from what I recall, are all ugly, and will be hidden, or transmogged. I saw a lot of complaints on the PTR. A lot of people liked, them, true, but there were more nasty comments when they came out. The boots all look like Uggs, too. <br />
<br />
The work is there. The level of detail is there, but the only word I have is &quot;unappealing&quot;. At best, lackluster. At worst, it's too busy, visually cluttered, bulky and awkward, and is like a mish-mash of the clown colors of TBC and &quot;savage&quot; elements like iron, fur, and leather. I don't recall any animations or effects that were worth getting exited about, either, and overall, color wise, they're muted and all earth tones. <br />
<br />
But, hey, at least it's not the bikini chainmal horror that are the class sets for transmog from salvage crates. Those, the designers should be embarrassed of. <br />

Get on the PTR for yourself, and check it out.</div></div><hr />

True that in BC, the PVP armor was a recolor of the tier gear, but what seems to be the issue to me is the staggering number of recolored sets. Back in BC, you'd see people in the full tier set and say &quot;Wow nice! Way to go!&quot; Then you'd see people raiding in the PVP set and go &quot;lol welfare epics.&quot; Now you have 6 variations on the same design and none of them particularly stand out from the other. It's similar to the current mount problem where you have 12 different subtle variations of the same wolf, talbuk, pig, etc. The result is that none of them feel special in any way and they just feel like recycled trash.</div></div><hr />

I'm still curious as to why, even to this day, they still cannot seem to design a hunter set that comes even close to achieving consensus approval.

So what you're saying is because pro-flight couldn't change their minds, you gave up on progressing the game for the better with your development mindset of experiencing the content from the ground floor? Pro-flight destroyed this game going forward. Got it. Thanks.<br />

There wasn't an unclear answer! Blizzard clearly stated all along that they weren't going to implement flying. Players were pissed. But it wasn't until they made the official announcement that they were never adding flying, now or in the future, that players got mad enough to unsubscribe from the game. They hit Blizzard in the wallet, which is where they listen the best.

Pretty much my reaction too. They're spinning this HARD. They're saying everyone was upset about them giving &quot;wishy washy&quot; answers, when Ion a pretty solid declaration in Polygon's interview, they'd decided. Now all of a sudden it was a discussion? Say what? &quot;We're not doing it&quot; is not an invitation to argue for it more. <br />
<br />
I think this reaction, and some of the other comments, adds up to one or more devs digging their heels in the sand over the issue, and pigheadedly refusing to change their minds, even with the outcry (and the same CM who's now saying there was a &quot;discussion&quot; was defending the decision), and a higher up had to step in. Thus the passive aggressive requirements to get the ability, it's totally a &quot;FINE, we'll add it, but you're going to do all the stuff we came up with, without it, (Because prolonging apexis grinds are so important). <br />
<br />
It's all pretty amusing. It completely strikes me that some devs got their heads knocked together by the higher ups, and told to knock it off, and give players flying. Now it's all &quot;Oh, we need to learn how to change our minds&quot; and there was some &quot;discussion&quot;, and Lore burbling away how they really, really want to get better at communicating. I've seen this before, seen managers dragged kicking and screaming into conferences rooms and had the law laid down on them, and after it's all &quot;Oh, it was a totally constructive and positive dialog, I feel so much more empowered now, let's forget I was acting like a complete jerk and let's go get 'em, team!&quot; <br />
<br />
I really wonder if some jobs were threatened. It smells like it. <br />

Several sets could use a bit more flair though. Possibly it's due to their over-reliance on animations and effects this expac. A lot of gear has cool little gimmicks but looks somewhat bland the other 75% of the time.<br />
<br />
Continuing to withhold the sets from LFR is pretty lame. Even if I'm feeling the 'incentive' to do higher difficulties on my main I won't go through that hassle on alts.. meaning more often than not I just don't bother with my alts at all. The root of most problems in WOD really, so much is just not worth the bother.<br />

Makes even less sense to keep punishing LFR when you can obtain identical sets afking through PvP anyway. Hell for my Pally main the PvP ones are BETTER looking!</div></div><hr />

We're going up against the last of the, now demon infused, warlords, demons of the Legion topped off with Mannoroth and Archimonde themselves and mages get THIS!?<br />

To each his own, man. I think this looks great. It's a cool throwback to Magisters and Tirisfal Regalia. Personally, i would rather the gear reflect something about the class rather than something about the monsters we fight. I don't like putting on evil demon masks with fel energy coming out of the shoulders to celebrate killing bad things. <br />

Never crucified GC myself. I hated when Blizzard did put him in a gag, and criticized his use of Twitter, because he writes long texts very well, but is HORRIBLE with 140 characters.<br />
The only thing that made me want to crucify Greg was to see him leaving Blizzard to work in another multiplayer online. I was expecting him to work on some single-player systems, so he could learn and develop some unique stuff. <br />
<br />
As for GC coming back to Blizz? Unnecessary. His greatest contribution was the openness, and goodwill discussing with common players and theorycrafters on WoW Forums. And they can resume this behavior following his example, without the need of his return.</div></div><hr />

GC was always a hack when it came to development and a silver-tongue when it came to the community.<br />
<br />
Rather than undoing the mistakes made, we're advancing them. Not even expanding on.<br />
<br />
The new models are still a wash and all the tier sets this expansion show similar enthusiasm for aesthetics. They can't even be pressed to fix old model issues that existed since vanilla.<br />
<br />
I want this expansion to be over already. They're too willing to cave into whining that doesn't involve actually fixing the core game issues.</div></div><hr />

What? The point of raiding is to get items? The point of raiding is to get a challenge, to kill stuff with friends. The loots is just a bonus reward. If you only raid to get items, you are doing it wrong.</div></div><hr />

yep, i find it hilarious that mage actually is the best looking poo amongst all these poo.<br />
<br />
well, armor sets looking seriously bad is one thing, but for me , i felt the saddest part is losing the social aspect capital cities (like shattrath) provides, people used to surround bad ass raiders with sick looking tier gears from the top guilds in realm n inspect them for minutes and talk about the player and the player's gears with their own friends + guilds, the discussion could go on for quite long. <br />
<br />
Previously, there was player interactions within other players in the same realm, same city, same faction, now people just sit in garrison and dont bother and never care.</div></div><hr />

Seriously these may be the worst armor sets they have ever made and the changes between mythic and heroic/normal are so small they might as well not exist. At least the current mythic tier actually looks radically different from the other versions this is just insulting. I wanted to believe so bad that WoD was just a shitty expansion and that Blizz really wasn't this incompetent, but now I have serious doubts. I'm pretty sure the Activision/Blizzard higher ups make all the decisions based on cutting costs and silence the creative voices that still exist there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this tier is slightly above average in total. Some sets I really like (Priest and Monk), some are alright, and some are just sort of there. None stand out as particularly ugly to me. <br />
<br />
I really really really like Monk - Alliance version and pretty much all of the Priest recolors. Love the design, not too many crazy details, a clear theme and idea, and colors that go nicely with each other, no clashing colors (like on the Mage set ... purple, green and gold, plus a sky blue and a darker &quot;foul&quot; looking green? ... not my thing)<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again I notice how much some version of dyes would improve things for me. Maybe things like taking a color palette of an existing set and putting it on another one? E.g. I think the new Mage set looks fine, but don't like any of the colors. If I could take those sweet sweet Monk-Alliance color palette and apply it to any set, 95% of sets would be beautiful to me.</div></div><hr />

So somewhat Blizzard succeeded in making sets that some, not all, likes. And that should be just fine, as those who don't like the sets, most likely got some awesome looking transmogs ready for use anyways. <br />
<br />
The thing I enjoy the most out of these sets, are the fact that they are &quot;simple&quot;. Easier to use together with other pieces for cool now transmog sets. I tend to have a problem using Tier sets in my transmogs, as there is always some detail on a chest piece or a pair of gloves that just never really fits with anything but the set they belong to..</div></div><hr />

Feels cheap for a company the size of Blizz with a game this size with this player base. Also, it looks kinda lazy AND why even have separate faction colours when the elite version of both is the same? That makes no sense to me :S<br />
<br />
All in all, I'd rather have seen them do LFR sets as re-colours of dungeon gear, kept actual raid loot with new models and used the dev time to create the LFR models to create a PvP set, gear is their only thing and now they don't even get to look special and unique, just coloured differently.<br />

Also, I find most of those tiers Fugly. The only good point these armor sets have, is that they aren't as big as a gallon. They learnt that monstruous &amp; voluminous armor pieces are horrible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Former company diminishing the employee or employee embellishing his role? I tend to feel that like in any company, when the organization gives an individual a lead title, that person has responsibility and clout to set direction (as long as it isn't 100% counter to a higher manager's direction). But within the purview of the WoW game, Ghostcrawler had ultimate authority to refine the direction of the game as he saw fit (from a systems view). <br />
<br />
It's interesting that in the aftermath of Ghostcrawler, Blizzard decided to just make it vague was the leads are responsible for (other than art vs non-art).</div></div><hr />
