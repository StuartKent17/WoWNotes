Maybe I'm just not into choppers but those bikes looked terrible imo. Looked like the design a 12 year old would make when told to make a really cool/savage motorcycle. Also Horde/Alliance bikes look almost exactly the same except one is a tricycle the other one isn't</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll hold my breath, but I'm not much of a trike fan. Here's to hoping they come forward with some really cool stuff. Both Paul Jr. and Blizzard have some of the best works of art. It will be neat to see them overlap.</div></div><hr />

Please tell me which reality, tv show or whatever where episode 1 is 5 minute long intro from a trailer recording over and over with 2 minutes talking and leaving with a cliff hanger just when it was suppose to start?<br />
<br />
No, I don't complain for sake.. Like I said, I got my hopes up way high. Were hoping to at least see the guys in the workshop shaping one of the bikes or whatnot.</div></div><hr />

It's a multi-episode show designed for the web. It isn't going to be any longer than 5 minutes because people on the internet don't have an attention span any longer than that.</div></div><hr />

I really dont know why we cant both faction have their faction choppers... Its like &quot;Alright, we built two choppers. Some will like the alliance one, some will like the horde one... AND NOW ONLY ONE FACTION WILL GET A NEW MOUNT!&quot;</div></div><hr />

I know, it's a video game, but I ride a motorcycle, so I was hoping for a realistic bike, but treads are just not feasible for any real on-road riding. Also, the Horde trike concept doesn't do anything for me, anyone who's ridden a trike knows that it doesn't turn or behave much like a regular motorcycle, not that being a regular motorcycle matters I guess. Still, I used to enjoy Paul Jr's stuff on the show years ago, and naturally I'm a wow fan so I'll stay tuned in to it.</div></div><hr />

Still think they should implement both models. If both designs end up looking good, it'll really be a ragefest when they go with what they're planning to do, which is give one faction a free new mount and leave the other with nothing.</div></div><hr />

I'll look forward to these every week. i also hope they dont make it too blue vs red<br />
<br />
Also: in this thread, people who somehow think they OWN blizzard because they pay 15$ a month shoving their opinions and DEMANDING the bikes to be JUST the way they want, and taking every decision as a personal insult. Oh and angry mouthbreathers raging because 6 blizzard employees had 2 meetings with a celebrity INSTEAD OF SPENDING EVERY SINGLE LIVING SECOND ON WOD!!!!</div></div><hr />

....and it's not a coincidence. Don't think Paul Jr. has free reign to do whatever the hell they want. They're going to use the Goblin trike animation for the Horde bike when they implement it into the game.</div></div><hr />

Not all orcs are horde. If this is a horde expansion, then wrath and tbc and vanilla, and cata are all alliance expansions. (full disclosure, I don't think they are, I am just inverting your logic.)<br />

Not all orcs are horde. If this is a horde expansion, then wrath and tbc and vanilla, and cata are all alliance expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, because those expansions were totally about the Iron Alliance. Sorry, but what? There might be a few aesthetic difference, but at the core, the Iron Horde stuff is similar to Orc stuff, and we'll get enough of the former.</div></div><hr />

Yep. You're right. Personally though, I think this is a lame marketing exercise angled at the small amount of people that might see this series, have never played WoW before, and want to 'ride' one of these bikes in game. <br />

Earlier today, we announced the Azeroth Choppers head-to-head match-up between the Horde and Alliance, and we’re very excited to share the upcoming episodes and final bike creations with you. We saw a few questions following the announcement and wanted to take a moment to clarify things.<br />
<br />
First, we want to make it clear that players globally will be able to vote for their favorite faction bike—either Alliance or Horde. Second, the bike that receives the most votes will then be made into a faction-specific-only mount and be available FREE to all players (usable when playing characters of the winning faction, of course). Your vote will be very important and could just be the one that lands your favorite faction a shiny new mount. If you haven’t watched the trailer yet, check it out here and stay tuned to Azerothchoppers.com for more details!<br />
<br />
Or to make it easier for you, more specifically<br />

I can see where they are going with it though. &quot;Members of the losing faction can buy said bike off Blizz store for their faction. Also, because loser bike got so much interest, we have decided to go ahead and make that available to all players via the Blizz Store too.&quot;</div></div><hr />

At any rate, I'm looking forward to seeing the final product.

The fact that they said nothing about the losing bike one way or the other did not escape my attention. Anyway, it was a fun enough watch, though a bit shorter than I was expecting. The format with the aside comments and misleading edits is something of an industry standard nowadays and probably lifted directly from the American Chopper show, so I can't really fault them for it.<br />
<br />
Can't say I was expecting tank treads on either of the bikes. Probably due to the fact that the game already has a couple motorcycles with regular wheels. Should make for some unique mounts, however they turn out.</div></div><hr />

Also, not sure why you think this is taking so many resources. Six guys spending probably a grand total of 4 hours to provide feedback and direction on commissioned bikes being manufactured by professionals, and some filming and editing by the DVD Production Department that handles interviews and behind the scenes featurettes.<br />

Maybe I'm just not into choppers but those bikes looked terrible imo. Looked like the design a 12 year old would make when told to make a really cool/savage motorcycle. Also Horde/Alliance bikes look almost exactly the same except one is a tricycle the other one isn't<br />

<br />
It would have been nice however to have at least one actual chopper come out of this whole Azeroth Choppers thing. The Alliance bike should definitely ditch the tank treads.<br />
<br />
And as far as only one faction getting the bike, that's clearly a ploy for voting purposes. They'll give out the winning faction's bike first, then finish up the second one and release it a bit later for FREE. They aren't going to make anyone pay for the other faction bike; not at this point with all the other money controversies going on.<br />
<br />
The only way I see them monetizing this is that if you redeem the bike on one faction, you have to buy it for the other.</div></div><hr />

I agree. The tank-treads are more rough looking and fit Horde much more than the alliance. The only tank-treads I've seen for alliance were the dwarf sieges as well.</div></div><hr />

They look like Kimpex Commander Trex 3.0 ATV Tracks usually for snow and mud, not streets.<br />

how fast can a giant boat with a couple propellers powered by steam fly? <br />

But hey who am i kidding .<br />
I wonder what will happen to the finished models when they are up and running do you think blizzard will give them away with a vip all expenses paid weekend to pick it up from blizz HQ all inclusive with shipping to the home of the lucky wow player ? that would generate even more interest.<br />
Still its enticing and i'm looking forward to the next episode maybe in a few years it will will be lockheed martin designing a flying mount with guns</div></div><hr />

Whoever loses will be in uproar about faction favoritism. That and it just doesn't seem fair to reward half your playerbase for doing nothing while the other gets shit.<br />
<br />
At the very least the losing faction should still be able to get their mount by buying it from a vendor or doing a legendary style quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if it DID fit for the alliance too it would still be lame to give it to both bikes. Would be better of just having one with tank-treads. And I doubt they will change the designs, as no one really pointed out any &quot;flaws&quot; cus dem scared of paul jr throwing chairs at them.<br />

so far i think the alliance one looks better. but its just the base so who knows which will look better<br />
<br />
I wouldn't call that &quot;Steampunk&quot; at all, more like working with what they have, true they may run on steam but I doubt that is what they were going for. See all old Alliance tanks, subs and boats. Not steam punk just runs on steam.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rough-hewn wooden wheels with iron banding, as opposed to the smooth, gleaming wheels of Alliance vehicles. Still no treads in sight.<br />
<br />
The singular example of treads you've provided is a broken down cannon, which possesses none of the Alliance steampunk qualities you're actually talking about. Thank you for making my point for me.</div></div><hr />

Where did they say that? I'm pretty sure they want them to work and drive around with them a little just like every bike he makes in the show eventhough they are more for show than actual riding. If they wouldn't work that would be really disappointing tbh... If that is the case then just make a design on the computer and make some replica shitty thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That being said the Bikes look pretty sweet. The treads feel a bit weird though. I'm already starting to see the forms of possibilities they could take these. <br />
<br />
For the Horde bike: Giant rough fenders in red with spikes over the back treads. Horns lining the sides of the bike providing a pedestal for your feet. Large handlebar with a Gronn or Ogre skull in the front.<br />
<br />
And for the Alliance bike. A golden head of a lion or eagle over the gas tank going forward past for front fork. Blue and golden bodywork that looks like armor plating. The tail arcing gracefully towards the back and down to give a really sleek and fast overall look. <br />
<br />
They're not going to be anything I'm imagining, but it's interesting none the less. Will look forward to what they come up with for sure, loving this idea for a series.</div></div><hr />

If you are ignorant to a situation, its better to save face and just not talk. Otherwise you look stupid, like you currently do.<br />
<br />
Earlier today, we announced the Azeroth Choppers head-to-head match-up between the Horde and Alliance, and we’re very excited to share the upcoming episodes and final bike creations with you. We saw a few questions following the announcement and wanted to take a moment to clarify things.<br />
<br />
First, we want to make it clear that players globally will be able to vote for their favorite faction bike—either Alliance or Horde. Second, the bike that receives the most votes will then be made into a faction-specific-only mount and be available FREE to all players (usable when playing characters of the winning faction, of course). Your vote will be very important and could just be the one that lands your favorite faction a shiny new mount. If you haven’t watched the trailer yet, check it out here and stay tuned to Azerothchoppers.com for more details!<br />
<br />
Or to make it easier for you, more specifically<br />
<br />

Cute, but you really think the losing faction isnt gonna get some way to get the mount aswell? <br />

Also, tank treads for the Alliance? Eww. Even our tanks don't have tank treads.<br />
<br />
What is so unique about these designs?<br />
<br />
Just wait until the alliance one turns out to be a recolored version of the Mek chopper that they can quickly edit and reuse in the game. Or the horde one looks like a recolored version of the goblin trike that they can reuse.<br />
<br />
Not sure how anybody can act like either one are awesome. As of now they are just welded together metal bars with wheels....<br />

Stop whining about all that free content they're giving you for your 15 dollar monthly fee! Like a short web-series about designing tacky ass motorcycles that half the players don't give a shit about until it comes time to put it in the game! <br />

So whining beforehand is going to help any?<br />
<br />
I definitely expected this. That the community is just going to whine their nipples off for every episode of this like it's going to stop them from making it. I can definitely respect if people want both choppers out but griping about it in the forums will probably get you marked as spam</div></div><hr />

I should've expected that the community is just going to doomsay everything with each episode of this. I'll be glad when it's over just for that reason.<br />
It doesn't matter, because whoever wins, the other side will get pissed off and more whining comes from it regardless. Thats not doomsaying, its just how it is.<br />

Maybe I'm just not into choppers but those bikes looked terrible imo. Looked like the design a 12 year old would make when told to make a really cool/savage motorcycle. Also Horde/Alliance bikes look almost exactly the same except one is a tricycle the other one isn't<br />

I tend to agree. Don't like the tank-tread ally bike, but think it could look really good for the horde. For some of you haters out there, be patient for the end design. this is just the skeleton.

Horrible OTT American &quot;dramatic&quot; editing. Awful design already; tank treads for Alliance - what even? Fuck Chris Metzen and his Alliance cardigan and faux fanaticism.

At least it was only a few minutes of my life wasted on this guff after skipping the 5-minute intro.<br />
I take it as the utmost truth, and not a the rant of man-child, coming to the forums to waste another 5 minutes, trying to diminish others to feel mature without deserving it.<br />
Perhaps a better and bigger mirror is a great suggestion for your next birthday gift.<br />

The opening of this show suddenly took me back to the time when we hadn't SSAO in WoW, when I tried to submit all my tauren to the Transmog gallery of Blizzard.<br />

100% correct. The whole project is laughable. Feels like Metzen and co are in that place where they got all the toys they can dream of and that's what their life is now. Screw paying customers that want content, we're gonna put time in a crap show because we like choppers.<br />

By the Looks of those bikes it seems the guys at &quot;Azeroth Choppers&quot; believe that WOW's player demographic consists of 'retarded' 12 year olds LOL<br />
<br />
Talk about adding insult to injury :rolleyes:<br />

What's pretty amazing is how heavily edited that video is, yet they still have numerous shots of Paul looking bored/very clearly thinking &quot;lol, what a bunch of nerds&quot; almost the entire time the camera panned to his face. And then they put in the part with his wife laughing! Someone in video editing must have some serious hate for Sam and Chris. <br />
<br />
Also, if that's the edited version, I'd like to know what was happening in the edited footage if that was the good stuff...why would you hire a bike company that obviously has no passion or interest in the game, I'm sure you can find a bike shop that has some WoW players on payroll and/or at least doesn't act like you're a total dork when on camera.</div></div><hr />

Best LOL moment of the episode: When Chris Metzen was first shown the ally bike he went like: &quot;OH shit this looks like crap&quot; for a second but then regained composure and went: &quot;Err, awesume job guys...derp&quot; HAHAHA<br />
<br />
&lt;3 Metzen :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's because said bike company was born in reality faux drama television. They know how to fake it.<br />
The original show follows some father son company, in which the father and son have some heavy disagreements, so the son goes solo and sets up a competing business (That being the guy in this video, Paul Jr.) and at first failing miserably when building a business (pro. ably only done for the reality television drama). So it's fairly logical as why they'd go him when making a mini parody version of that. It's essentially one expensive cross promotional advertisement for both companies and the original reality television show.<br />
So you can bet your ass that Discovery is also silently supporting this deal.<br />
<br />
And I only know because I watched some of the episodes when it was on discovery, late at night, and I either happened to wake up in the middle of the night or couldn't sleep.<br />
<br />
Hell, why would you expect anything of quality when you've seen the intro being a panning of the Blizzard HQ building and them doing the whole cliché telephone scene? That's a more important question here.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Asperity</div><div class="date">2014-04-18, 07:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">How fast could those continuous track go anyway? 25 mph? Looks like these will be a very slow bikes...<br />
<br />
They look like Kimpex Commander Trex 3.0 ATV Tracks usually for snow and mud, not streets.<br />
<br />
They can go really fast: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tEew07frB4#t=47<br />
<br />
p.s. the bikes are developed for an imaginary world (WoW) afaik there are no asphalt highways in WoW so traks look legit for the offroady type of envoriment.</div></div><hr />
