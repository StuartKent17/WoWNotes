Legion Alpha - Voice Acting<br />
VO work is ongoing! I can't say to the extent that is remaining, but we're definitely not at 100% yet.<br />
<br />
As VO comes in, feel free to enter bug reports for things like the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sound files that cut each other off during a back and forth conversation (sometimes we get the duration wrong so it'll become a shouting match)<br />
Sound files that don't match the written text<br />
Sound files that can't be heard from a reasonable distance<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
Could the ability be Strike of the Windlord since the weapon lore says Al'akir imbued the weapon with his power?<br />
Good call. We'll address this. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/673766589796253697))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
with the removal of honor in Legion, will we be able to purchase old pvp armor for transmog with gold?<br />
That's one option we're considering, but haven't made a final decision yet. Rest assured, they'll be available somehow. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674016635083096067))<br />
<br />
any plans for gladiator mounts and titles to finally become account wide? Only seems fair with all the account wide pve stuff.<br />
No such plans, no. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674016834035671040))<br />
<br />
Will item level matter regarding stats in low level PvP?<br />
Yes, in a similar manner to max-level PvP. The stat difference will be considerably smaller. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674017015082823681))<br />
<br />
As a major transmogrification and PvP enthusiast, will there still be &quot;Elite&quot; transmogable gear for PvP in Legion?<br />
Gear awarded at higher rating will continue to have the &quot;Elite&quot; designation and appearance. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674017299418877952))<br />
<br />
will pvp tabards be account wide with the new transmog system?<br />
We have no plans to change how the PvP tabards are bound. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674016366496636928))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification<br />
Sorry if this is a repeat: all items from completed quests are auto-added to wardrobe. Does this include Draenor treasures?<br />
You will get credit for any one-time treasures in the same manner as a quest. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674017436325122048))<br />

They match the color scheme of the MM artifact (first and second form which are the base and enhance versions)</div></div><hr />

Without the Carapace appearance and the eagle emblem I'd say it would be hard to tell what class this set was for. Although I was expecting more like a mountain hunter mixed with Vykrul sort of thing, it looks alright.</div></div><hr />

The cowl like helmet, v shapes on the chest, decorated belt buckle, upper part of the pants, embedded circles on the shoulders, small rounded shoulderpieces in general etc. Even the colored eyes are there.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Today we are taking a look at one of the armor sets we haven't previewed at all yet, Hunter Tier 19. It shares some elements of Sylvanas Windrunner's armor design.&quot; - is a interpretation/comment from mmochamp not from blizzard - so it's not the offical wording.<br />
<br />
About the set - it looks ok - not hunter like imho - I prefer more cloth/leather and mail not that heavy looking stuff they did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell will sooner freeze over before there's a nice looking set for most classes and it's only getting worse. They really need to take a step back and realize that designing armours based on scribbles from 'bring your child to work' day aren't working. It doesn't matter if this is the first tier or not and if they saved all their creative juices for the last tier, T18 says otherwise with some of the worst designs in the game.<br />
<br />
Thank his holy noodly appendages for transmog and T8.5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. Hunters what do you think of as armor? LEATHER, FUR, LIGHT chain mail that is a hunter this set with glowing eyes? It does look like plate, sorry, but maybe because I am old and not an artist where I have to find something new because leather/fur has already been done before is not what this mmo is about. Please reference WoW trailer the original what is the dwarf hunter wearing? I understand things need to evolve look better, but this just sucks like why can other games like Witcher 3 look more of a hunter than WoW...<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
And to add more, looking at the picture... looks like a death knight, put a long cloak for an ominous look, and glowing eyes, hmm DEATH KNIGHT. Are you sure someone didnt just label this wrong</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RoKPaNda</div><div class="date">2015-12-10, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All the sets are starting to look the same.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caerule</div><div class="date">2015-12-10, 04:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This set is awesome. And for those confused about it's appearance, it's a Dark Ranger set, inspired by Sylvanas, which colors your eyes, like Sylvanas and the Dark Rangers.<br />
<br />
Which is awesome. I've been looking for a mail hood which gives you glowing red eyes for ages now!<br />
<br />
So, extreme thanks for Blizzard. This hunter set is exactly what I have been hoping for, for my elf ranger! :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocc1f11a099b</div><div class="date">2015-12-10, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this hunter armor is boring. They are following easy road of just redoing things they already made. I wish for some freschness, less detail work on armor as it clutters it so much that it is hard to see it as whole. Then they could be a little more creative with each piece as they all have been there in many variations already. When I look at leveling (green) armor sets for lvl 10-60 then I think they were way more free, creative, less cluttered than all armor tiers after BC. <br />
<br />
It is also boring to see shoulder part being always the only one being radically (though not even that lately) different from other tiers. Hunters shoulder piece isnt big but some classes (like druids) really get gigantic shoulder armor every time. How about something small, simple and putting more emphasis on other armor parts that are nowdays just a background to the rest? I think I have seen much better armor sets created by users in Wow when they mix themselves differentg armor pieces. Pretty ones are those simple with some detail just where it is needed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumaras</div><div class="date">2015-12-10, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hideous armor sets lately. Even in wod the epic armor sets would barely pass for green quality designs in wotlk and prior. Definitely seems like some there have been some budget cuts in the armor design area. It's like they think since there is transmog they can just stop trying for new designs and make everyone xmog everything to old designs that were actually original.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faylinn</div><div class="date">2015-12-10, 04:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is supposed to be based off of Sylvannas and her dark rangers. The pvp ones look more like Helf/Belfs in general.<br />

<br />
How long have we been in WoD? I'd suspect it's been at least a year or so in Azeroth time, right? She can't be pregnant still can she? She already pooped out one little Orc hellion after Cataclysm and was pregnant again at the end of MoP.<br />
<br />
This is likely why Thrall will &quot;lose hope&quot; and give player Shamans Doomhammer...though...it is a little odd to lose hope yet go home to protect your wife and children? I mean, what good is protecting your family if you have no hope for the future or a good outcome in the future? Does he just assume we're all going to fail against the Legion so he runs off and hides in a cave?</div></div><hr />

&quot;Today we are taking a look at one of the armor sets we haven't previewed at all yet, Hunter Tier 19. It shares some elements of Sylvanas Windrunner's armor design.&quot; - is a interpretation/comment from mmochamp not from blizzard - so it's not the offical wording.<br />
<br />
About the set - it looks ok - not hunter like imho - I prefer more cloth/leather and mail not that heavy looking stuff they did.<br />
<br />
You linked an artwork that featured armor that combined leather, mail, and cloth. So, you know, exactly what was just criticized with the &quot;make up your mind&quot; diagram, lol</div></div><hr />

There's a picture of him and Aggra standing around in Dalaran which I think is on WoWhead when they were previewing Dalaran. Thrall only gets injured to the point where he can no longer wield Doomhammer so gives it to the player. That doesn't mean he won't be back later with a new weapon (if he decides to pick up a new one). Thrall living is what pisses me off about Varian. The two are mirrors of each other so for Thrall to get a slap on the wrist and live while Varian possibly dies is insulting. If one dies, both should. Hard to say Blizzard doesn't favor the horde when they pull that crap.<br />
<br />
But god damn, if Aggra's pregnant AGAIN, that makes at least 3 kids. Those two are moving way too fast. Blizzard might as well make a pregnant model just for Aggra since it seems she's knocked up every time we see her anymore. Seriously, Aggra's turning into a stereotypical 50s housewife: pregnant and barefoot standing in front of a stove while tending to the kids and her husband. &gt;_&gt; Good way for Blizzard to kill a potential strong female character by having her be constantly pregnant and thus unable to fight. You'd think they'd at least have her pregnant every other expansion and not every expansion. Jeez. That's not good for her health, either. Have too many kids close together, she'll basically develop brittle bones and lose her teeth. An enemy can sneeze on her and she'll break a bone. Not like Azeroth has vitamin supplements she can take to hold it off a little. Orc be damned. I doubt they're that different physically from humans where they can have kids back to back with no detriment to the mother. I honestly have to wonder how much research people do at Blizzard because some of the things they do is either questionable or downright stupid.<br />
<br />
Hunter set is ... okay, I guess. I haven't liked any of the hunter sets over the years and actually prefer the questing sets to the tier sets. If LFR actually gets any of those T19 recolors, I might use them on my hunter, but since Blizzard keeps treating LFR like crap, I'm not betting on it. Chances are the two mythic sets are for elite PVP and mythic raids, then the other 4 are heroic, normal, the higher tier PvP gear but not elite, and then a recolor exclusive to NPCs ... or are mythic and/or challenge dungeon exclusive. So LFR and honor gear will get something that looks like a quest reward from Elwynn or or something. I'm not looking forward to the LFR armor preview after the crap sets LFR got in WoD. Blizzard may as well recolor piles of crap and use those for LFR at this point. The LFR sets in WoD also got reused everywhere. Grandiose tokens (but not formidable), baleful tokens, HM gear, and BRF gear all use the same models. They got old before BRF even came out. To say I'm tired of spikes and claws are an understatement, and I'm not happy to see even more pop up on Legion gear. While the hunter set doesn't seem to have any, other sets do.<br />
<br />
I do agree with the other comments that the sets should be shown on other races. Or have a model viewer where we can select who we want to view the set on. I don't play males so would be nice to see the set on females. My hunter particularly is a blood elf so I'd rather see the set on that than on a human male. Males sometimes don't show things that the female armor does (such as whether or not the chest is a tank top or something).</div></div><hr />

<br />
False, Varian counter part is Garrosh. Varian lore may be the same as Thrall's but bringing him back was to make him the opposite of Garrosh kinda like Admiral Taylor and Nazgrim were pushed at the same time. Both Garrosh and Varian were push at about the same time to promote Alliance vs Horde, and if any indication of Admiral Taylor and Nazgrim is like Varian and Garrosh, when ones dies the other is set to follow. Even tho Thrall and Anduin don't have the same background, one can say Thrall and Anduin are closer than Varian and Thrall, as both Thrall and Anduin have the same mindset and both are respected from opposite factions leaders. Where as both Garrosh and Varian are not, and sometime they are hot headed with Bipolar Disorder (sometimes they are heroic, sometimes assholes).<br />

Do you even play Horde, Aggra was part of WoD, did you not finish the Quest? Did you not see what Thrall's mom lecture Thrall about? Aggra had a bigger role than Voljin did. Also Aggra is annoying, the &quot;strong female character&quot; in WoW is the Banshee Queen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You go to rescue to Tirion because it turns out that he had been captured during the Broken Shore scenario (still unavailable, FYI). Ok. So you fly there and... there's not a whole lot of demons for some strange (non-in-game) reason. You kill a few demons, but there is no real challenge. I know it's not meant to be Proving Grounds gold difficulty, but dear goodness it was brain-dead.<br />
<br />
After dealing with the initial waves, you move on to reach Tirion and he's mortally wounded. You go straight from there into a cave to pull out Ashbringer from a ruined piece of stone. Balnazzar makes his appearance and you *handily* defeat him (see above paragraph on difficulty). You come back out and Tirion is losing health with each sentence he speaks until he dies. When he dies you see a golden orb representing his soul going up into the heavens. Lord Maxwell Tyrosus tells you the body will be buried underneath Light's Hope Chapel and has you return to Dalaran. At this point, I don't know if you are supposed to know the teleport ability for the Order Hall because the premade came with it.<br />
<br />
So I used the teleport ability and upon reaching the paladin Order Hall... that's where it was left at, as there were Blizzard construction signs.<br />
<br />
In conclusion: The artifact intro was too short, too easy (and I'm saying that as a mainly LFR player), and the story did not feel compelling for the most part. I ACTUALLY FELT RATHER DIRTY after obtaining Ashbringer (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/120978-ashbringer). The player deserves better and so does Tirion Fordring.<br />

No, I don't want it to be that difficult and I said as much in my original comment. It's just that I think the artifact intro could have been more meaningful. For example, let's take the lack of huge numbers of demons that I mentioned. They could simply add more as strictly visual, like out in the distance but moving ever so slightly so they don't look like statues... maybe even add an elite or two demons you face off in the waves with simple to avoid mechanics like a lengthy cast-time cleave or something...<br />
<br />
And then the story aspect. Adding spoiler tags for other people's benefit: I think it could have been more compelling if Tirion hadn't been mortally wounded right off the bat, and instead keep him seriously wounded until he dies towards the end doing some heroic move as a last hurrah for the character. It's like how the original ending for Casse in Independence Day film was for him to save the day by showing up in an old airplane (which was very upfront that he's going to die). The producers decided against that, and changed it to Casse being in a fighter jet like the rest of the American forces but would have his missile become jammed. Guess which ending felt more emotionally compelling.</div></div><hr />

They match MM artifact colors.<br />
<br />
It seems people didn't really understand what is going to happen for T19 armors : <br />
For each class the art team pick a spec, and base T19 on its Artifact. So all the color scheme of the armor will match the color scheme of the weapons.<br />
That's how it's gonna be, you can already see it based on the T19 we already have.<br />
<br />

It's still better than many of the previous Hunter armors. Still, I get what you mean - then again, true Heroes (make them actually Legends) need to stand out with their attire against us rubble ;)<br />

What are you talking about? It's a metal set with wooden inlays. <br />

I also would like to get mail/chain sets. Hunters are not Robocop.<br />
<br />
When will we get sets like this:<br />
https://i.imgur.com/U3r8ZnS.jpg?1<br />
<br />
Set that look like hunter and not like warrior or something else.<br />
<br />
Look at the brown one. You're (IMO) not spot on. It's leather or wood (you know hard leather armor, yes? Google it), surrounded by metal to make it sturdy. It has underlying &quot;scale&quot; armor (not chain, doh).<br />
Taking the purple armor for this bends your eyes drastically. ;) I love the new armor, btw.<br />
