Armory Stats - First Aid Profession<br />
Battle for Azeroth appeared to be removing First Aid as a profession, with the First Aid achievements (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/10599-legion-medic) being moved to legacy achievements. The same build also moved bandages to Tailoring, but that has changed.<br />
<br />
Currently bandages like Embersilk Bandage (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/74556-embersilk-bandage) are again categorized as First Aid (Bandages), but First Aid trainers no longer teach the profession in game.<br />
<br />
Today we are looking at the First Aid level of 2.3 million players (US and EU) active in the last two months. The highest First Aid level of all of the characters on each player's account was selected.<br />

Court of Stars +22 Solo<br />
Mione (https://www.mmo-champion.com/members/548309-Mionelol) is back again, with a Court of Stars +22 solo (Bursting (http://www.wowdb.com/affixes/11-bursting), Quaking (http://www.wowdb.com/affixes/14-quaking), Fortified (http://www.wowdb.com/affixes/10-fortified)).<br />
<br />
<br />
Total run time: 3 hours and 20 minutes<br />
Item level 975 and Artifact Level 77<br />
Mione also has done +11s in time (DHT, HoV, BRH, Cathedral, Wardens, Upper Kz, Arcway iirc) and even a +12<br />
Xavius, Odyn (13% recently) Sisters, or Goroth might be killable but no real big milestone in sight. <br />
Fallen Avatar/KJ/Aggramar/Argus solo kills are still fairly out of reach. <br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Patch 4.1 Mounts<br />
The PTR servers saw the addition on a handful of new mounts and pets which would be released with the first major content patch of Cataclysm. Two color variations of the Fire Hawk mount, initially called the Crimson and Baryl Fire Hawks, were found on the PTR. Later these were renamed to the Pureblood Fire Hawk and the Felfire Hawk, both of which are still obtainable. With the rework of the two new dungeons, the Razzashi Raptor, and Zulian Panther were also added as drops from each instance. The Molten Front Offensive featured the addition of a mount as well, the Flameward Hippogryph. <br />
<br />

<br />
Legendary Staff<br />
Early datamining of the 4.1 PTR Patch revealed a potential new Legendary Weapon used by casters. The first legendary questline since the Shadowmourne in Icecrown Citadel had been found. This quest and item had a lot of similarities with the ICC one in that the quest line would start with crafting a basic version of a weapon and then upgrading it through unique objectives and collection quests in the raid.<br />
<br />

<br />
WoW Token Introduced<br />
On March 2, 2015 Blizzard introduced the WoW Token! This item allows players to simply and securely exchange gold and game time between each other. This essentially allowed players to purchase gold (from other players) or play the game for free if they had lots of gold. Last year Blizzard allowed the token to be exchanged for Battle.Net balance (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6316-WoW-Token-to-Battle-Net-Balance-Now-Live).<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Darkmoon Faire Race<br />
Patch 6.1 added a new feature to the Darkmoon Faire. The Faire Race, if completed in time, rewards participants with vanity items, toys, and a pet. The race course includes many obstacles and hidden boosts such as speed boosts and springs. Completing the race within 11 bell tolls awards the Darkmoon Racer Roadhog achievement.<br />

<br />
Cindermane Charger<br />
2015 saw the addition of a mount molded by Ragnaros. The Cindermane Charger is available for players who participate the Recruit-A-Friend program. This program offers unique benefits for both players, such as an experience boost, game time, mounts, and pets. To participate, just open the social tab, and click the Recruit A Friend button. You will be asked to fill out some information, and after the player you recruited joins the game, the rewards will become available.<br />
<br />

<br />
Falcosaur Mounts<br />
The Falcosaur Mounts were found in early Legion datamining and their sources were unknown. Shortly after the launch of the expansion, a new secret quest line along with a new faction was added to the game. After killing a Matriarch in the Swarm! World quest, an Orphan Falcosaur would spawn. This began a secret quest line unique to each type of falcosaur mount which would ultimately unlock the mount version of the Orphan along with a new faction, Talon’s Vengeance. <br />
<br />

<br />
Journey to Un’goro<br />
The fifth expansion of Hearthstone introduced a few new mechanics into the game. Besides all the new available cards, each class received a unique Quest card which required the player to complete an objective during a game to unlock a special benefit. This new card marked the emergence of a few new decks, among which Quest Rogue, and Quest (or Exodia) Mage, were perhaps the most popular. The second new mechanic added was Adapt. This allowed the card being adapted to gain one of three random benefits, such as Windfury or Divine Shield, among other ones. Aggro decks such as Paladin, Shaman, and Druid made good use of this mechanic, allowing for early board control and tempo.<br />

<br />
Hunter Animations<br />
Hunters were not forgotten with the Legion animation overhaul. Patch 7.2 added new animations to Arcane Shot, Barrage, Bestial Wrath, Black Arrow, Bursting Shot, Butchery, Cobra Shot, Concussive Shot, Kill Command, Marked Shot, Multi-Shot, and Piercing Shot. With the expected rework of Survival in the next expansion, we might also see a few new or updated spells in the near future.<br />

Brigitte Lindholm (https://playoverwatch.com/en-us/heroes/brigitte), daughter of Torbjorn, is the newest hero announced for overwatch. She is a support and tank hybrid who uses a flail and shield to heal, give armor and attack her enemies.<br />

<br />
How Blizzard doesn't understand that is beyond me. People use things that are effective, and don't use things that aren't effective. Buff it so it's effective. Make bandages based on HP percentage instead of a flat number, put different types of bandages that can be used in combat or remove specific types of debuffs, etc. I remember when First Aid had a way to remove bleed effects.<br />
<br />
It simply doesn't make sense, lore-wise, for only Tailors to know how to make bandages. Anybody can fucking learn First Aid, even action heroes in movies.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunderella</div><div class="date">2018-03-02, 12:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Used to love First Aid as a rogue but then it Recuperate came in and never ever did I use another bandage. Well maybe in some rare extreme pvp cases. I will probably not miss it but I would love for it to get a real revamp instead of going away.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pachycrocuta</div><div class="date">2018-03-02, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I remember when Cataclysm came out, there were talks of making bandages like potions, where you use it and done, except it would give you a HoT, instead of standing there and channeling it. If they would have done this, it would have been actually really useful. Even though I don't use First Aid much on my paladin, I don't want them to get rid of it. They just need to make it a hell of a lot better than they had it in Legion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do physical boxes even have media in them anymore? The game is already installed on your PC.<br />

Maybe that's the intent here? BfA's still so early in development that nothing beyond the game world is really set in stone yet. If the community presents some solid defense and suggestions, it's entirely possible for First Aid to remain in the game and receive a redesign instead.<br />
<br />
Probably the worst/least-constructive thing to do here though is simply complain that it's being removed without offering any alternatives or meaningful improvements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They tried with Healing Tonics in WOD, but that required fishing for some reason.<br />
<br />
Other than that, only time First Aid has been useful to me was when leveling classes without self heals. But Blizzard increased health generation over the years. <br />
<br />
It's a bit sad they remove it instead of finding a use for it, but then again, it's really useless for group play when you have healers and potions from alchemy, it's only useful for solo play.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tumaras</div><div class="date">2018-03-02, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The issue with first aid really was that it was undertuned. Going through the effort of leveling first aid should provide you with the ability to heal with bandages that are at least a little better option than healing from most other (non-healer) sources. But during the great homogenization of classes they were all designed with the basic attack A until B procs, C on cooldown, with some sort of self-heal spell for every class that was more powerful and easier to cast than bandages. So that basically made them obsolete.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with the general idea of pruning ineffective facets of the game. But it's important to keep in mind that first aid WAS a useful part of the game at one time and it was these design decisions that led to it being essentially obsolete. The danger in all of this pruning is the same issue that we've had as players since it began in late-wotlk, which is that it dumbs the game down and removes a lot of the customization/immersion/depth of the game. I would hope by now that Blizz has heard the message loud and clear that we don't want wow dumbed down to pointless profs and talent choices.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">davidcryix</div><div class="date">2018-03-02, 06:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't understand why people care (or want for that matter) what the collectors edition boxes look like.<br />
<br />
Its a COLLECTOR'S EDITION. Collecting implies that you are collecting it to display in some fashion. It is a larger, more expensive version of a physical game box that contains other items of value such as behind the scenes blu ray, cd sound track, mouse pads, art books, keychains, and yes, the physical discs which are not very useful in this day and age. Most people who will be buying the physical CE are doing so with the intent to put it on a visible shelf, most likely alongside older physical collectors edition boxes. Thus, if the color/artwork is bland or unpleasant, it will be an eyesore while on display. <br />
<br />
Does that make more sense?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Koriani</div><div class="date">2018-03-02, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also need to remember, First Aide was never meant to be (along with Fishing and cooking) an actual, flushed out, crafting school. These three were originally designed as mini-craft schools (so to speak) without the development and variety (or usefulness) of the craft school you have to pick and choose from. Its why everyone could train them, because they weren't originally designed to be &quot;needful&quot; at all.<br />
<br />
Fishing and Cooking got the massive overhaul as Blizzard realized the power of the mini-game they could provide and have both become far and away more full craft schools with all the benefits of a full craft school (but without only being able to pick one or two). First Aide can now either step up to the same level of &quot;mini game&quot; or go the way of the dodo as it has become less and less useful as the rest of the game was buffed/expanded on.<br />
<br />
Even Archeology, which was an added mini-craft-game later, had more time spent on it to flush it out, sooner after release - than First Aide has ever been given. It hasn't changed much at all since release. Maybe one of the few parts of the original game that hasn't =D (good or bad..)<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, unlike Fishing and Cooking - it just has less variety it can go to. There aren't &quot;bandages around the world&quot; for you to find. They aren't going to flush it out into some type of nurse-mini-game as that would take away from the tools of alchemy and main classes with heal abilities.<br />
<br />
So if its just a useless system people spend 10 minutes to level in order to have top level for xyz &quot;actually useless&quot; reason (outside of a few dailies and having bandages just in case while questing...) then I can certainly see the thinking now of a &quot;Well we did this for all the other mini-crafts and First Aide is this boring dinosaur of a gaming age gone by...time to get rid of it rather than spent any dev time making it into a minigame.&quot;<br />
<br />
When the same purpose can be provided by an NPC selling cheap bandages in the middle of XYZ capital city; it really is a relic from a game design that isn't the rule anymore.<br />
<br />
So why keep it around? <br />
<br />
Or spend dev time and energy and resources turning it into more of a worthwhile minigame - to (somehow) match popularity to fishing/cooking/archeology. <br />
<br />
*Tries to imagine what type of first aide mount you would make... or how to make pots without infringing on alchemy*<br />
<br />
*shrugs* Makes sense to me, even though it doesn't bother me to keep it in either. I can see the point.</div></div><hr />

Regarding First Aid: It's an RP element kinda thing. They could make it useful instead of removing it. Cutting flavor and soul from the game has been their main objective since they started with WoD, and they will go on until there is nothing left but figures and wire frames. Sad.</div></div><hr />

It was one of those things that felt completely useless outside of pvp and niche situations. If it healed for *more* and they would have allowed it to be put on you like a heal over time then yeah sure it would have been good and probably be used quite a bit by everyone. As for player drop, I'm not surprised this expansion has been pretty horrible in many ways. <br />
<br />
The zone scaling was another bad move, in concept it was great but of course they had to mess it up. Who even asked for mobs with more health while leveling? Why destroy leveling dungeons, they hopefully realize that the queue time is well over 2-3 times higher than it used to be. They split the dungeons at 60-80, 80-90 and they don't let you queue for both expansions. The experience vs time spent doing dungeons is pathetic. It's such an epic fail of a patch.<br />
<br />
Don't get me started on the issues with the expansion itself, it would be easier just to focus on what they did &quot;right&quot;...</div></div><hr />

It's a secondary profession, optional for anyone who does or does not want it. I'll admit I never use bandages anymore, but that's because they are so undertuned. Blizzard could easily fix that if they wanted to.<br />
<br />
I used it plenty during WoD, to be fair, but that's primarily because they had non-bandage consumables.</div></div><hr />
