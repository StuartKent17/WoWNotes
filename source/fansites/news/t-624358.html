There is definitely a lot of AE (area effect damage) going on in World of Warcraft dungeon runs at the moment. We’re not too worried about it for now – on the contrary it’s nice to see so many people doing the level-up dungeons on the way to level 80. If we find that AE tank + AE damage strategy (with no sheeping, sapping or other crowd control) is the only way people are running heroics and raids, then we’ll probably make some changes, but for now we’re content to just see what happens.<br />
<br />
Having said all that, we feel like a few groups are being left out of the AE fun, which makes them of less utility in the 5-player dungeons. We aren’t able to provide a lot of details yet, but here are some upcoming changes we’re making.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman – we are removing the threat component from Fire Nova Totem and Magma Totem and increasing the damage from Magma Totem. This should provide the Elemental shamans in particular with some formidable AE.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue – we are removing the cooldown from Fan of Knives and adjusting the damage calculation slightly to make daggers more useful for this ability.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid – we are adding Swipe (Cat) as a baseline ability.<br />
<br />
As is the case with most multi-target abilities, these three should be something you want to use when faced with groups, but never against single targets. Fan of Knives and Swipe, for example, don’t grant combo points so they should never be a core part of the rotation against single targets (like most bosses).<br />
<br />
These changes will be available in the next minor content update, so keep an eye out for the next PTR push. <br />
He replied later on this post about the shaman changes. <br />
We might still do an AE spell for Elemental as well, but that is further down the road. Let me be clear that shamans are intended to be a totem-using class. I would not expect a lot of changes that let you opt out of using totems. Instead we want to make them fun, easy and worth the effort. We did consider the problem of having to run up to AE, but this is what several specs do already -- mages to use Arcane Explosion for example. We talked to a lot of Elemental shamans who thought it wouldn't be a problem. Also remember than when a mage channels Blizzard, that is all she is doing. Totems do damage in addition to your spells.<br />
<br />
Our goal is not to make every spec in the game awesome at AE damage. Our goal is to give you a button you can push to contribute in some way. We think Elemental shamans need to fill this role more than the rogues or Feral druids however, since they tend to compete for slots more against warlocks and mages, who have excellent AE. Our goal is for Elemental to be there as well. This may not get them there 100%, but it's a good improvement over nearly 0% which is where they stand today. <br />
<br />
As far as whether you can AE too much, as I said, that is something we're keeping an eye on. Even Naxx is considered an entry-level raid and not the kind of place that requires Sunwell (or even Black Temple) -level coordination. For now it's nice to see so many players with the option to run 5-player instances and entry level raids. I would not expect the strategy in Ulduar and Icecrown to be &quot;I'll Swipe while you guys Blizzard. Volley and Hurricane down all the trash.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
Consolidated list of upcoming Paladin changes<br />
We have already announced or suggested all of these changes would be forthcoming in the next minor content patch. I thought I would list them all in one place for ease of use.<br />
<br />
Divine Shield: Penalty changed so that all damage done is reduced by 50% instead of a attack speed penalty.<br />
Divine Protection no longer causes an attack penalty. Divine Shield's penalty was changed to 50% less damage done by the paladin.<br />
Sacred Duty: This Protection talent no longer affects the attack penalty of Divine Shield and Divine Protection, but grants additional bonus Stamina.<br />
Avenging Wrath, Divine Shield, Divine Protection, and Hand of Protection have a shared, 30-second cooldown. The Forbearance effect is no longer triggered by Avenging Wrath.<br />
Judgement of Wisdom now returns a percentage of base mana instead of a percentage of max mana.<br />
All mana drain effects now return a percentage of max enemy mana (making mana drains less punishing to paladins and other characters without large mana pools.)<br />
Judgements of the Pure: This Holy talent now increases the damage done by Seals and Judgements.<br />
All paladins receive a single-target taunt (name TBD) as a base ability. <br />
He also made another post here to clarify the changes on mana drains<br />
<br />
Since this seems confusing:<br />
<br />
Before:<br />
Drain Mana on a mage with 15,000 mana drains 2500 mana (16% of their mana)<br />
Drain Mana on a paladin with 5000 mana drains 2500 mana (50% of their mana)<br />
<br />
After:<br />
Drain Mana on a mage with 15,000 mana drains 3000 mana (20% of their mana)<br />
Drain Mana on a paladin with 5000 mana drains 1000 mana (20% of their mana)<br />
<br />
Those are not real numbers -- just indicating the concept of what the change will do.</div></div><hr />

As a tankadin, I'm pretty happy with those changes. Especially the single target taunt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a better idea. Improve other classes CC. <br />
<br />
Too many people exclusively look for sheeping when looking for CC. That is lame. Give Hunters a &quot;shootable net&quot;, something that they can use to trap from a distance. Make Priest's &quot;Mind-Control&quot; more reliable, allow the Priest to be bubbled, or dispered, and unattackable during MC. I see Hunters turned down ALL TO OFTEN for CC positions, and the Priest's Mind-Control almost entirely ignored in endgame content.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if Im wrong.. doesnt this hurt holy paladins the most and does close to nothing to retribution and protection paladins? That is, unless the percentage is upped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sacred Duty: This Protection talent no longer affects the attack penalty of Divine Shield and Divine Protection, but grants additional bonus Stamina.<br />
<br />
So.. this means sacred duty does absolutely nothing apart from the lowered cooldown and stamina increase?? Because prot paladins are op in pvp.. right?</div></div><hr />

So are mages, warlocks, priests, two specs of druids, hunters (int on the gear, remember?), and shaman. Everyone's hit by this.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if anti-mana draining talents were put in, soon. Just for the PvP sake.<br />
<br />
<br />
And everything else is a Ret fix (the damage reduction on bubble). I'd guess that the Judgement of Wisdom change was done because not only holy paladins, but any mana class (mages, warlocks, shaman, and so on) were gaining too much mana from the judgement. It's not a change to ret/prot at all, since they work on base mana.<br />
<br />
Holy should be relatively unaffected; their time in instances is spent healing, not dpsing a judged mob for mana back. While solo'ing/questing they'll see a change in mana regen, assuming they judged wisdom. Note that Seal of Wisdom is unaffected.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and yay for Holy re-gaining some dps, and prot gaining stamina -and- a single target taunt! Huge news there, now we don't have to rely on the gimmicky Righteous Defense.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So is the 'Grants addition stamina' bit in Sacred Duty beyond the 6% it currently yields, or am I reading that wrong? <br />
It should be additional, beyond the current 6%. I'd guestimate 8% or 10% will be the new talent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, you have to take into account the loss of* 280 spell power and 3% crit to each member of the the party/raid, which more than offsets any damage caused by a magma totem, even a buffed one.* The only time it would be worthwhile would be in a melee heavy 5 man group.</div></div><hr />

Only short sighted people worried about &quot;their&quot; spot in raid due to a now non-existent nitch are troubled by this. <br />

The idea is, &quot;ok what do we need for the raid, two tanks, three heals, five dps? What do we have online... oh perfect let's do it.&quot;<br />

[blizzquote author=Ghostcrawler source=]We have already announced or suggested all of these changes would be forthcoming in the next minor content patch. I thought I would list them all in one place for ease of use.<br />
<br />
Divine Shield: Penalty changed so that all damage done is reduced by 50% instead of a attack speed penalty.<br />
<br />
this is fine ... and i saw this coming anyway<br />
<br />
Divine Protection no longer causes an attack penalty. Divine Shield's penalty was changed to 50% less damage done by the paladin.<br />
<br />
this is fine also<br />
Avenging Wrath, Divine Shield, Divine Protection, and Hand of Protection have a shared, 30-second cooldown. The Forbearance effect is no longer triggered by Avenging Wrath.<br />
<br />
WHOA WHOA WHOA ...blizz i thought you said you would take a smart apprach to fix &quot;AW + bubble god mode dps&quot; which is perfectly fine and i agree that it was stupid and skillless.....but the damage penalty and a 30 sec cd on all of those attacks is way out of proportion... u guys really need to sit down and think about this and realize you have made a bad decision<br />
<br />
the biggest nerf i c with this is that HoP cannot be used of a party member if you have poped AW or bubbled which is just retarded<br />
<br />
take the cd off and keep a 2-3 min forberance that affects HoP and bubble and make it so u can pop wings in bubble considering with AW in bubble you will be doing 60% dmg and give holy pallies the ability to get 20% more healing in bubble if they pop wings (120% / 2 =60%). i think this would be a great fix and is not op at all considering the 50% damage penalty in bubble fixes the &quot;AW + bubble god mode dps&quot;<br />
<br />
anyways that is my take on this change... i hope you do the right thing cuz i really want to be competative in arenas with my ret and not have to settle for just my mage and shamman[/list]</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fan of Knives having no cooldown is great. Even greater is actually making it more viable WITH knives (daggers). However, the issue I have is this. In this very post, they stated that they do not want AOE to affect raids/heroics. AOE is for lower instances. Rogues don't get FoK until 80. So...when will we use this move? I think they should switch it to 75 and Tricks of the Trade (a move probably only necessary in raids) to 80. It's not the end of the world and by the time they make the change, I'll be 80 anyway, just a thought though.</div></div><hr />

Right now I play a level 73 enhancement shaman, but the only time I find myself dropping some totems is before we face off against a (sub-)boss or when we need some situational help/buff.<br />
<br />
Magma or fire nova? Hardly ever use them. The nova one generally got destroyed before it tended to go off. Utter waste of a huge mana costing totem.<br />

Playing with Death Knights is bizarre, I've been out DPSed already by similar level Death Knights and their AE is just insane. I like my suvivability, but on the DPS side I am feeling kind of meh right now.</div></div><hr />

No idea, but we did a guild run through Nexus with two DKs, one holy paladin, one rogue and me as elemental shaman. And the way we cut through the mobs and bosses was just easy. There was little strategy involved to be honest. And that was not SWP or such gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they know why - 90% of the people currently leveling from 70-80 are overgeared or heavily overgeared for what those instances are tuned for. <br />
<br />
I'm glad they're relooking at AoE - because my guild currently has no warlocks and only two mages at 80. We had considerable problems downing Gluth until we were able to swap in a mage and presto! Down in one attempt purely because of he had capable AoE. (So much for bring the player)<br />
<br />
On that note, god, I really wish they'd stop using the worst school of totems for every 'fix' of shaman abilities - first Stoneclaw, now Magma? Who are these elemental shaman they're speaking to? Can we kick them in the nads?</div></div><hr />

I agree. Many team combos are totally dependant on doing that and will have problems with this change. Also with this change we probably will not dare to use AW until both HoP and DS have been used.<br />

Sometimes I wonder if Blizzard ever plays in arenas themselves. When it comes to changes for paladins they never seemed to have been able to understand what works and what does not.<br />

<br />
People complained about them going ape-shit with Avenging Wrath and then doing immunity effects like Hand of Protection on themselves so they could heal with a large degree of impunity.<br />
<br />
Sorry, poor phrasing on my part. <br />
The crux of the matter is that HoP is an immunity effect that the Paladin can place on themselves, and the issue was their abuse of these immunity mechanics alongside their formidable burst damage. Not just the fact that they could become immune while still attacking (otherwise the obvious fix is to just stop bubble allowing attacks).<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
No, they have a shared cooldown similar to how trinkets of the same 'class' but not same cooldown work. A 2min and a 1.5min cooldown spell damage trinket pair trigger a cooldown on each other to prevent simultaneous use, but using the 2min one does not start a 2min cooldown on the other trinket.</div></div><hr />

let see, it does 50% less damage, cant use 20% wings so thats an overall damage reduction per use in a raid. are judgements, DS and mana regen were already nerfed. We are expected to be on par with DPS using CS,DS, and judgements. Go check out some of the top guilds parses and see where ret stack in raids, its not top and thats with it being an undead instance. now utility has been cut, Its just plain sad</div></div><hr />

Hawmight, see it how you wish, but calling a downgrade a nerf is pure over-reaction. Some of these compounded changes aren't nerfs, others are nerf. All in all, it was the nerf to mana and utility that made me quit my Paladin. The bubble-wrath, however, just created so much angst that it had to go, and I can't seriously call that a nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Only cooldown is 30 sec, the debuff for bubble is 2 min. <br />
<br />
For example:<br />
<br />
Hand of Protection	Rank 2<br />
6% of base mana	30 yd range<br />
Instant cast	5 min cooldown<br />
A targeted party member is protected from all physical attacks for 8 sec, but during that time they cannot attack or use physical abilities. Players may only have one Hand on them per Paladin at any one time. Once protected, the target cannot be protected by Divine Shield, Divine Protection or Hand of Protection again for 2 min.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wings doesnt have the debuff anymore. &quot;Avenging Wrath, Divine Shield, Divine Protection, and Hand of Protection have a shared, 30-second cooldown. The Forbearance effect is no longer triggered by Avenging Wrath.&quot; So, what you will see is a paladin using wings every 30 sec.<br />
<br />
Im almost sure is like that...<br />

So let me get this stright. AW is a move that increases all damage and healing by 20% for 20 secs. Right?<br />
<br />
And it's cooldown is going down from 3mins... to 30 secs. Right?<br />
<br />
Then how is this anything but a MAJOR ret/holy buff for PvE? That's a huge DPS/HPS increase right there! I doubt very much that this will go live, as I'll top the DPS charts all the time with this increase. <br />

I'd expect this to stay on a 3 min timer, and just that every time it's used, that the 30-sec cooldown on the other abilities is activated. Kind of a mini-forbarence so to speak.</div></div><hr />

I think you missed the point.<br />
<br />
This has ALWAYS been a PvP Nerf from the beginning. Illidan didn't complain about hordes of Bubble+Wing Retnoobs pwning his face, but many Arena matches started with a Ret popping Wings+Bubble, and having 12seconds of immunity with 120% damage and 50% armor pen. That was unacceptable...for PvP, but had no impact at all on PvE.<br />
<br />
The fact is though, in PvE, there are many situations where a Bubble can save a Rets life. Sure, only Rogues have some form of &quot;immunity&quot; talent to save their butts (Shamans, Wars and DKs are pretty much SOL if things go south) but survivability has always been a boon for a Ret. <br />
<br />
The fact that DS now reduces your damage by 50%, I think there should be NO shared CD between AW and Bubble, as there is no point. No Arena Ret would pop both for 12 seconds of immunity for 70% damage, but in PvE, it would allow a Ret to pop wings whenever it's off cooldown and still use their DS if called upon.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself this: why is it that a BM Hunter can pop Bestial Wrath whenever they want, and yet fallback on Feign Death (and Shadowmeld if you're a NE) to drop aggro if necessary? Why doesn't Bestial Wrath put Feign Death on a cooldown?</div></div><hr />

12 seconds of immunity in an 8-12 minute boss fight is serious business?<br />

<br />
<br />
Before the original patch, Forbearance lasted 1 Minute, not 3. The reason they upped it to 3 in the beginning was to prevent you from abusing Divine Shield and Divine Protection. During this time AW didn't cause forbearance at all, and a Ret could use it whenever it was off cooldown (same as how a Hunter can spam Bestial Wrath -glyph anyone?)<br />
<br />
Then they put Forbearance back in at 2 minute once PVPers started crying foul (rightfully so).<br />
<br />
Given that Bubble now nerfs your damage by 50%, there is no reason for AW to share a CD with it. No PvP'er would ever use it, and even if they did, before the 3.0x patch, you could bubble for 12 seconds at 100% of your damage, and now you would be reduced to 70% if you had AW active. That isn't a big deal.<br />
<br />
But what happens when a Ret pops wings and pulls aggro? Has to wait 30 seconds before he can shield himself? What happens if a non-Human Ret pops wings and the boss then hits him with a Mind Control? <br />
<br />
I fully understand why this needed to be balanced for Arena (not BGs..Arena!) but the fact is that PvE Rets are getting nerfed for no reason at this point.</div></div><hr />

I doubt that they are reducing the cooldown, but using it will start a 30 second cooldown on the other abilities they listed - think how on-use trinkets work, 2 or 3 minute cooldowns but theres a 10 or whatever second shared cooldown to stop you using two together.</div></div><hr />

THIS is how ignorant people are. If you knew anything about paladins, you'd know that hand of protection, makes you unable to do any physical attacks (CS, DS, and autoswing) so it would be a complete waste of wings to use it while under hand of protection.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nono, I ment the wings cooldown being reduced from 3mins to 30secs. Not the bubble nonsense.<br />
No... AW still has an internal 3 minute cooldown. READ what they wrote. They now have a SHARED cooldown. This means, you'll have to wait 30 seconds after casting one, to cast the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, there's a sort of cooldown in the fact that FoK costs 50 energy and rogues get roughly get that much in 5 seconds IF they do very little or don't do anything else (basically just do white damage to you). Not to mention the talent is an INTERRUPT that lasts 3 seconds, which means that you have enough time to cast frost nova, blink, NS, pop pain supression, ect after the silence is over the rogue. Not mention a combat rogue has VERY little protection against snares, all of 4, imp sprint, trinket, and vanish all of which have 2 minute cooldowns at best and cloak of shadows which only has a minute cooldown if you invest in subelty. Popping those cooldowns puts you at a pretty severe disadvatage vs future fears, polymorphs, stuns, etc. So in conclusion, its an aoe kick that costs 5 times as much and costs 37 talent points to get and isn't part of the best damage rogue spec in the game, I wouldn't be too worried about it.<br />

I agree that it's a boost to PvE Ret, but then imo, it should never have been implemented in the first place. Blizz broke it when they tried to fix it, and this is a partial fix to what they broke. <br />
<br />
All they had to do was what they did, which was to change Divine Shield to cut damage to 50%; that alone entirely removes the ability for Arena rets to abuse AW and Divine Shield. The 30 shared cooldown isn't horrible, but it's still unnecessary. <br />

Make Priest's &quot;Mind-Control&quot; more reliable, allow the Priest to be bubbled, or dispered, and unattackable during MC. I see Hunters turned down ALL TO OFTEN for CC positions, and the Priest's Mind-Control almost entirely ignored in endgame content.<br />

No, not really a solution. Making classes even more homogeneous is not a good thing.<br />
<br />
Currently mages, locks and hunters have more or less the same CC potential, from more powerful and easier to apply but with the less possible targets and a downside to more versatile but harder to pull off. Rogues are pretty high also. Priests have the most powerful one but it is very limited and dangerous - for a good reason. Making it more powerful/reliable would possibly break many encounters.<br />
<br />
Hunters are only turned down because of huntards. They are enough of an easy mode class already and tbqh I'd rate them above any other class regarding CC, taking into account pet OT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trust me when I say this, Cloak of Skill is far more useful in a boss fight then DS.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
in 8-12 min boss it would be more like 24-36s of imunity<br />
<br />
anyway, bubble is hardly OP for PvE, its just one of the extremely useful tolls for removing some bad debuffs</div></div><hr />

I rather have the attackspeed penalty. Even if i can use AW while i am bubbled i would just loose dmg. (as ret) but for the holypaladins it is some nice stuff in pvp.<br />
<br />
Edit: Nvm I should have read it more carefully.<br />
Big Pally nerfs -.- i feel bad for the holy pallys that takes nerfs that are aimed for rets -.-</div></div><hr />
