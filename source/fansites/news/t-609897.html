Stop whining already....<br />
<br />
Did you see the other changes we got ? the good one ? stop being so negative.<br />
<br />
I will only list the pvp ones.<br />
<br />
- Avenging Wrath no longer causes Forebearance, damage increase reduced to 20%, now increases healing done by 20%.<br />
- Blessing of Light and Greater Blessing of Light removed. Their effects have been folded into all relevant abilities<br />
- Divine Intellect (Holy) moved to tier 2, increases total Intellect by 3/6/9/12/15%. <br />
- Hammer of Wrath is now considered a Retribution spell, moved from Holy, mana cost reduced, missile speed increased, now usable on targets below 35% health. <br />
- Holy Shock (Holy) range changed to 20/40 yards when used on enemies/friends respectively, cooldown reduced to 6 seconds. <br />
- Improved Hammer of Justice (Protection) now reduces cooldwon by 10/20/30 secs. <br />
- Pure of Heart (Holy) reduced to 2 ranks, now reduces duration of Curse and Disease effects by 25/50%. <br />
- Sanctified Light (Holy) now also increases the critical chance of Holy Shock. <br />
- Seal of Justice/Judgement reduced to 1 rank with all the effects of the previous rank 2, the Judgement effect no longer prevents Fear.<br />
- Seal of Vengeance damage over time effect duration increased to 18 seconds. <br />
- Stoicism (Protection) moved to tier 2, now reduces duration of Stun effects by 10/20/30% and reduces chance your spells will be resisted by 10/20/30%<br />
<br />
Look at this... Look at how good some changes are. Holy shock....DOT Duration in half. Seal of vengeance increased. Stoicism. So many good pvp changes and you pick out the 1 bad thing.<br />
<br />
wait and see, Paladins will be just as good and maybe even better.</div></div><hr />

lol, are you joking??? Where is mana regen, where is the way to close the gap with your enemy? Where is spell interrupt and/or healing debuff, where is yor tool to stop being sheepspammed, and plus I don't see nothing that will increase our dps in raids. I only see the same weakness, with something worst added.</div></div><hr />

We becoming magesssss.........<br />
<br />
Well, in my eyes, this is something Blizzard does because of the priest(holy and shadow)/mage/warlock being the same in WotlK (spell power) priest NEED spirit, mages don't mind it (Never had mage, but I guess some spirit is good) but for locks it was useless... So they do this so that we can actualy take the same items as mages and priests...</div></div><hr />

With a controlled stun every 20 seconds and and increase in damage and shorter cooldown you get some good weapons to do ranged dps and stop people from running off. combine it with judgement of justice and there is no way in hell anyone will get away from you.<br />
<br />
anyways, we dont know how it will turn out, but when i consider my style of play with my holy paladin i see lots and lots of oppertunities to help out even more in PvP. The Paladin becomes a much more active class with these changes. Not just a &quot;stand back 30 yards spamming flash heals&quot; class.</div></div><hr />

Ahem hammer of resist :P anyway I'm ret and happy with my current pve status, but pvp is really screwed up, you need insane skill and cat reflexes to perform like other classes do with 2 buttons macro. I see the talent that increase judgemetn range too, it is made to allow you holy paladins move lesser ;) so this seem more like stand back. But anyway you are right on one point, still not complete list, just wait and pray.</div></div><hr />

WotlK is suposed to REAL buff Ret Paladins, even more than anything avaiable for Holy and Prot ('cause they're really far behind holy and prot). Instead I see hammer of nerf hitting Rets to buff Holy/Prot. Lay on Hands, Raid wide Auras, etc... aren't exclusive to Ret... any Pally spec have those.<br />
<br />
Why not move Precision AND divine strengh to Ret (never saw precision in warrior's prot tree) to actually help them? Does Prot needs str more than Ret or even Holy spec? LOL well, looks like we can get stoicism after all without loosing too many precious talent points.<br />
<br />
And increased mana cost? I tought that Ret paladins would use the same warrior/dk gear, wich means, 0 intelect. Maybe there is a hidden change were ret recovers 500 mana per hit, or increase mana poll by str *100, crusader strike and judgements doesn't use mana anymore, protects against mana burn, something like that..<br />
<br />
&quot;Improved Sanctity Aura (Retribution) renamed Sanctified Retribution, now causes all units affected by Retribution Aura to cause 2% more damage.&quot; - DPS aren't suposed to get hit! No way that is better than +10% Holy Damage from old sanctity aura (and chance for a raid slot when there are Prot Paladins) for ret pally dmg.<br />
<br />
Maybe they actually want to improve Ret Paladins as off-healers with new LoH and BoL into heals and avenging wrath increasing heals... lol<br />
<br />
&quot;Repentance (Retribution) mana cost changed to 9% of base, duration increased to 1 minute (10 second PvP duration), now usable against Demons, Dragonkin, Giants, Humanoids and Undead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, now I can see the reason they're nerfing Ret... that's soo overpowered... now I can &quot;Repensisted&quot; someone in pvp for much more mana cost and a ridiculous few more secs! LOL!<br />
<br />
At least Holy Wrath is a little bit more usefull... but not game breaking to worth all this &quot;Ret Love&quot; by blizz. They also said that ret paladins would be less &quot;lucky&quot; based, but they're going full &quot;when critical hit&quot;... crit chance is lucky!<br />
<br />
&quot;Good Job&quot; Blizz.</div></div><hr />

As you stated ..... &quot;Improved Sanctity Aura (Retribution) renamed Sanctified Retribution, now causes all units affected by Retribution Aura to cause 2% more damage.&quot; - DPS aren't suposed to get hit! No way that is better than +10% Holy Damage from old sanctity aura (and chance for a raid slot when there are Prot Paladins) for ret pally dmg.&quot;.<br />
<br />
....first of all...if your a real ret pally you would have imp sanctity aura to begin with which gives everyone in your group %10 more holy damage and %2 more total damage. This is no different than whats stated above with the exception of the new name for it. <br />
<br />
I do agree.....Ret pallies are getting almost zero in these patch notes. Blizzard continues to contradict themselves by sayin that ret pallies will mirror warriors and death knights. Then they go and reduce our Avenging Wrath from %30 to %20 increased damage. <br />
<br />
They also were suppose to get rid of the ret pallies mana issues. All I see is more mana issues. <br />
<br />
Im at a loss for words....I figured that the reason it took all this time for the pally tree to come out was because they were making it so much better. Im very disappointed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and I think warriors are gonne beat the shit out of most classes. 2-hand weapons in one hand? whirl-wind attack, unstoppable? 25yr jump with stun-effect every 45 sec? Execute at full HP? Now they are a bit like rogues, only wearing plate...my guess is that they are gone be the new owner class.</div></div><hr />

&quot;WTF is with this base mana bullshit on spells. What they don't want spells to me cast often now? So casters have to run around whacking things with their satff as a faux melee.... not smart Blizz.&quot;<br />
<br />
Did you actually calculate the cost of the spells? Its BASE mana all that means is that the value changes every time you level, it doesn't mean its going to be a % of your mana pool<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Improved Sanctity Aura (Retribution) renamed Sanctified Retribution, now causes all units affected by Retribution Aura to cause 2% more damage.&quot; - DPS aren't suposed to get hit!&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
It means the all party/raid members deal 2% more damage when you have it on, NOT that the reactive damage does 2% more damage<br />
<br />
&quot;&quot;Repentance (Retribution) mana cost changed to 9% of base, duration increased to 1 minute (10 second PvP duration), now usable against Demons, Dragonkin, Giants, Humanoids and Undead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ah, now I can see the reason they're nerfing Ret... that's soo overpowered... now I can &quot;Repensisted&quot; someone in pvp for much more mana cost and a ridiculous few more secs! LOL!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh yes its a nerf for those ret paladins who want to PvE....you know the ones that now have a CC on par with something like Sap. Add that to the 51 talent that heals people in melee range every 10 seconds by doing damage to multiple target. The only &quot;problem&quot; is a limited mana supply.....which is shared by your enhancement breathin</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least you can see how they fixed the totem twisting bug. They merged SoE and GoA into 1 totem, so now you keep windfury down + SoE without twisting, and there is no longer a tranqil air totem. In general from the listings for many classes, they rolled the unique things from one into another. Like druids can now rez like normal (non battle) and shammies can cleanse like priests/plds and the like.<br />
<br />
Tons of paladin changes, althought i dont know about the actual usage/effects. Like lay on hands no longer drains all mana.. uhh ok..<br />
I did notice many things like counterspell / turn undead and the like were no longer small casts but almost 10% base mana casts. And notice the salvation nerf? 2% for 10 secs but costs 10% damage and healing.<br />
<br />
With some of the changes, yep, its a beta alright. I think they are going to rely a lot more from experimenting once beta testers start giving feedback (as expected). I dig theorycrafting different classes, so I'll have see what the end result is if one of my accounts makes it in.<br />
<br />
From what I see, they are indeed removing unique abilities so classes are closer together, at the same time, removing the 'lazy' abilities to make people focus more on their skill versus relying on spells, buffs / etc.<br />

Wait a sec, doesn't it mean, that your raid will do 2% more dmg, because of your retri aura?</div></div><hr />
