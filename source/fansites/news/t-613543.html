Blue posts<br />
Tanking in Wrath of the Lich King (full version (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/9336801184-dear-devs-want-prot-pvp-to-be-viable.html))<br />
Better threat generation on non-tanking specs<br />
[...] It might even be okay if non-tanking specs can generate a lot of threat (heck, hunters do it), so long as they also don't have high mitigation.<br />
<br />
Past issues with Protection warriors<br />
[...] The best we can offer is flexibility so that you can pick up all the passive mitigation talents and someone else can try out a different build. The problem with Prot before, I'd argue, is that there weren't enough choices to go around so that by the time you got the bare minimum, the options left were pretty paltry. <br />
<br />
Class diversity in raid<br />
That is pretty much the point. No class brings anything so unique that you want them to come at the expense of others. You should earn your raid spot because you know how to tank and have some decent gear and a guild who can back you up. Maybe you're a great leader or maybe you don't argue. Maybe you've got a great sense of humor or are a good guild recruiter. All of those are better reasons to get into a group IMHO than because your buff is a unique snowflake. Quite honestly I'd rather raid with my friends than some jerk who has the perfect buff. And I really don't want to send one of my friends off to reroll a level 1 dude because we both happened to choose rogues at first level six months ago and now our group is suffering for want of a buff. If you can tank, you'll get into raids. <br />
<br />
Prot Warrior versus Paladin Tanking<br />
The Prot warrior should also be able to switch to dps, and they come with Battle Shout and Commanding Shout, two very solid buffs. [...] If the paladin is so much better at AE that you take him instead of a warrior, then we have a problem. <br />
<br />
Death Knights tuned raid encounters<br />
Again, the &quot;best Magic boss&quot; shouldn't be to the extent that you call the raid when she can't come. There will be no fights tailored to a particular class. Sorry. Believe me, we don't have to come up with a gimmick to encourage death knight raiders. Northrend is infested with them already. Ghouls are cool though. <br />
<br />
Balance between tanking classes<br />
You Sunder, you Demo Shout, Battle Shout, Challenging Shout. You might Piercing Howl depending on the encounter. You Execute. You Intervene. See where I'm going...? If you are really winning or losing fights based on whether your tank can Innervate, then we've probably made the content too challenging. The difference in skill (or gear) between a potential warrior and druid tank should have a much bigger effect on the outcome.<br />
<br />
The situations we've had before have been more like &quot;The paladin can tank all of Heroic Shattered Halls with no CC&quot; or &quot;The druid can do nearly double your dps while tanking&quot; or &quot;The warrior can achieve passive crushing immunity and has the only ability that can handle Shear.&quot; Those are egregious barriers to having 4 viable tanking classes, which is why we're trying to fix them. <br />
<br />

Blood Tanking<br />
A Blood knight can heal herself really well and Vampiric Blood lets the healers heal you a lot too.<br />
<br />
I think when the damage among the 3 trees is more normalized, the threat will be too. It's possible Frost or Unholy is better for mitigation, but if so, I would expect the difference to be pretty marginal over the long haul and possibly even depending on the boss.

Tanking balance and itemization<br />
There are a lot of huge changes in the expansion though. Warrior tanks are worried they won't be useful anymore because their big niche (surviving crushing blows) was given to all tanks. Paladin tanks are concerned because better AE threat is being given to all tanks. Death knight tanks are worried that they are going to get nerfed because of the damage they're doing. Druids are worried that they won't have the armor they are used to, and might be inferior tanks because of it. Almost every class is worried that their unique raid buff won't gaurantee them a spot in the raid any longer. We're worried about pulling it all off. :)<br />
<br />
Druids have talents like Thick Hide, Natural Reaction, Mother Bear and Survival of the Fittest in part to make up for the fact they aren't wearing plate, parrying or blocking. Is that enough mitigation to make them just as good end-game tanks as the other three tanking classes? We don't know yet. We haven't finished our testing and nobody on beta is in Naxx yet. If Bears are getting clobbered or their healers are running out of mana trying to keep them up, we'll fix it.

Protection Talent Tree Feedback<br />
We are about ready to do our next major pass on the Paladin trees. We think Prot does have too many mandatory talents, and too many talents that offer passive mitigation without other interesting mechanics or even dps. This thread is a great opportunity to discuss the tree and offer your feedback.<br />
<br />
For purposes of this thread, the kinds of feedback that are useful:<br />
Which talents are fun vs. which ones aren't<br />
Areas in the tree that tie up too many talent points vs. areas that feel barren<br />
Talents that feel mandatory vs. talents that feel fun but optional vs. talents you'd never get<br />
<br />
For purposes of this thread, we are less interested in:<br />
Mitigation and threat capabilities of the paladin vs. other tanks (we'll get to that)<br />
Holy and Retribution (we'll get to that)<br />
Mana, dps, interrupts or other paladin issues (we'll get to that)<br />
Whether it's a good goal for Prot to be viable at healing, dps or PvP. (It's helpful to mention when talents might fit these roles, but let's not use this particular thread for a debate on whether Prot should be at all decent in PvP.)<br />
Questions about other topics, pleas to visit other forums or catty arguments<br />
<br />
Rest assured this is not our only avenue for collecting feedback. We do talk to experienced and beginner tanks alike as well as drawing on our own internal resources to make decisions. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/9336672300-protection-talent-tree-feedback.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warrior.jpg Warrior (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / Talent Calc. (8885) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Protection Warrior and PvP<br />
As I said before, whether Protection shoud be viable for PvP is controversial. People on the extreme of both sides of the debate should be able to see pretty clearly that there are plenty of others who don't see their point of view. It's not an argument that is going to be won by debate, consensus or vote.<br />
<br />
As I've also said, there are some things we want to do with Prot to improve it. We could make a very fat, very boring tree with 30 talents that promise excellent passive mitigation. I don't think that's going to make warriors any more fun to play. Here's what we'd like to do instead:<br />
<br />
Add some more fun abilities to the tree. Warbringer is one such ability. It may not be something everyone will use, and honestly, we're cool with that. Some talents should be optional. We also know some tanks, even hardcore endgame ones are excited about the ability. As a tank it could be a good source of rage (Yes, we know you lose all your rage when stance dancing -- the design of Warbringer is not that you stupidly lose all your rage when you change to Battle Stance and then say oops.) It could also help your mobility on fights where you need to zip around a lot to put out fires -- that's part of tanking too. It's not all sitting there and getting hit by Brutallus.<br />
<br />
To make room for some of those abilities, you have to have some options. The classic tanking build from BC doesn't leave you a lot of free talents. We need to combine a few mitigation talents together to buy you some space. Also, must haves like Imp Heroic Strike and Imp Thunder Clap may not be must haves anymore, because...<br />
<br />
We're buffing Prot's dps. A lot. This is going to help with threat, and will make doing dps with a prot build (whether as OT, MT, leveling or doing daily quests) more fun. A lot of abilities that do +threat now are going to be doing +damage instead. You are going to see crits from Thunder Clap and Conc Blow that might blow your mind. You're going to hit Thunder Clap and have mobs stick to you long enough for you to use some other abilities. Oh and If you haven't tried Retaliation while tanking yet, it rules. For those who never got to enjoy the joys of Shield Slam with crazy +block, you'll soon get to.<br />
<br />
Warriors lost a very comfortable tanking niche with the removal of crushing blows. We need to make sure there are still good reasons to take a Prot warrior. Vigilance and Safeguard are good starts there, but we're also looking at buffing signature abilities like Spell Reflect. A lot of the recent changes were intended as buffs, not nerfs. We'll get you your Expertise back. We'll get you your cheap Devastates back.<br />
<br />
As we start to get the talent trees in better shape, we're going to be able to get a better handle on the state of balance. Simultaneously, people in the beta will start venturing into heroics and Naxx. This will start to give us some data for the first time on whether L80 Prot warrior threat or mitigation is too low compared to other classes. If it is, we'll fix it.<br />
<br />
I mention that because we designed Vigilance not as a band-aid to fix Prot warrior threat (because we don't know if it's too high or low yet) but because we thought it would be fun. Use it on that reckless warlock who likes to pull aggro and you turn a weakness into a strength. Use it on your fragile healer and you can, yanno, actually *protect* them. Instead of having to say &quot;Please wait for 3 Sunders before you attack&quot; maybe people will say &quot;That tank has Vigilance -- no way you'll pull off him.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/9336801184-dear-devs-want-prot-pvp-to-be-viable.html))<br />

<br />
That has been changed alrdy for quiet a while about shamans.<br />
<br />
in WOTLK: 1 strength = 1 AP however 1 agility = 1 AP and some crit and if talented in mental dextirity and ancestral knowledge 1 int = 1.1 AP.<br />
<br />
It doesn't sound as bad as you think but basicly this means also no more + strength items for shamans in WOTLK.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">woeye</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">History shows that Blizzard has done some, erm, &quot;funny&quot; things regarding class balance quite often. I remember how they tried fixing resto druids, but instead nerfing them, they just nerfed ferals and moonkins. Sometimes I really wonder whether Blizzard developers play their own game? Otherwise some of their suggestions would never have seen the light of day. <br />
On the other hand WoW has become an extremly complicated game (from a developer's point of view). Tons of several years old code, lots of stat values, lots of skill trees and talents and so on. Everytime they try to fix one aspect, like making offspecs more viable in TBC, some clever geeks will find new unintended tricks - like warlock/spriest stacking, bloodlust stacking and so on. Now Blizzard tries to fix this again. But I am pretty sure that some geeks will find other nifty tricks Blizzard hasn't thought of. <br />
Maybe, at some point in the future, it will be the best to just stop it and start from scratch with a new fresh and clean approach, don't know.</div></div><hr />

It's not that they're ignorant, they have very good data. They just don't make public statements about things they're not going to fix. <br />

&quot;We know that there is a bug in our product. But we will address it in our next release&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well, it's not only Blizzard is using this trick. Many major software companies act like this. If everyone was happy why would they buy a new version? Ok, MMORPGs provide new content as well. But anyways ...<br />
<br />
What I really can't get is why they did not fix resto druids in TBC. Blizzard said they added a new spell in LK so that they could tone done Life Bloom. <br />
Yeah cool. But what about Regrowth or Healing Touch? Why not buff those? Yes, Healing Touch has a long cast time (Oh noez! I haz to stand still to cast! Oh noez!), but why not tweak a talent to grant a lower cast time? Or a proc to lower the cast time? And what about roots and cyclone not sharing the same DR timer? What about a CD on cyclone? The community has written a lot of suggestions - yet Blizzard refused to look at them.</div></div><hr />

Currently on the beta the regrowth talents are so good that no one uses nourish.<br />

exactly! i saw &quot;shaman changes&quot; and i was like &quot;WHOA, finally some stuff for us, too! they fixed all the NYI talents, they also gave us new ranks of half of our abilities!!!&quot; and then i saw &quot;MSW doesnt reset swingtimer&quot; - mostly bugfix, &quot;all enha old gear was reworked str &gt; ap&quot; well, its just fix, too, no interensting changes :/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Melian_EredarEU</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 02:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So blizzard has no clue how to design a class, because they ask the community?<br />
<br />
Then i think no major company has a clue how to build the product the produce.<br />
Take a car company for example: BMW has absolutely NO idea how to build a propper car. - And you know why? Because they ask their customers what the liked and what they disliked in the last model. Of course they ask what the customers miss at the moment and what they want to be improved. So, from your point of view, BMW could not build a car. They have no idea how to do so.<br />
Bit strange that they are one of the most luxurious and favored car-companys in the world.<br />
<br />
For any reasonable man, a company that collects information about what the customer likes and what he dislikes, is just doing a good job. Because with their next product, they will fit the needs a bit better.<br />
<br />
And the fact that blizz - or any other company - doesn't immediately answer on to the feedback they get is very simple:<br />
They hear something, then they think about it, discuss it in their workgroup. And if they think it is a good idea, they implement it - and announce that in the next patchnotes (or if you look at a other company they announce it on the next product release).<br />
Nothing in this policy is extravagant. - Normal business.<br />
<br />
And also one of the guys before me mentioned a very obvios fact, why they sometimes do mistakes.<br />
In the beginning a new feature sounds well most times. But you have a developer team of about 100 people designing a feature - then you give it to the customers and they check it - and in the case of WoW, try to push the new features to the limit. And then a community of ~10million people find a trick, the developers haven't seen before. That is simple logic. 20million eyes see more than 200.<br />
Sometimes finding these mistakes take longer, sometimes it goes realy fast.<br />
Look for the Leatherworking Drums for example. They have always been realy &quot;imba&quot;. - But no one knowed about their &quot;imbaness&quot;, because no one has tried to push their utility to the limit. - But with the months passing, instance after instance comming, someone noticed and from one day to another every member of a major guild specced leatherworking. So blizzard was dump because they haven't seen that leatherworking was imba? - 10million people haven't recognized that for about a year - but 100 should? This is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OrSin</div><div class="date">2008-09-04, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand why they changed Str to AP. They didn't want to change the item level, so they did the easy thing. I got the 4 piece T6 set and never noticed how few red slot and how many yellow slots they have. Do Blizzard really thing we need to gem for crit in every slot? 90% of shaman gem for AP (with str gems), shouldn't that tell blizzard we need more red slots not just yellow. <br />
<br />
And stop being lazy blizzard and at least change the socket bonus to AP or better yet change the gems to all red and make the socket bonus to crit. You know we don't need str so str for socket bonus is waste. If since person at blizzard played this spec they would have noticed this immediately.</div></div><hr />

But some things aren't changed as quick as most people would...People tend to forget that there is a bigger plan spanning over a few expansions instead of patches.<br />
Things Blizzard and we aren't happy about are sometimes fixed through patches, but issues that cannot be fixed with a patch need to wait until an expansion.<br />
<br />
I can understand that you are a bit sceptic about Blizzard and their changes, because some things aren't changed for the better. But don't interpret this as something they do to f.ck us, but rather as something they tried and perhaps failed.<br />
<br />
I think Wrath of the LIch King will change WoW completly, and for the better. You cannot compare the results of TBC with the results that wotlk will yield, because now they have a lot more feedback and knowledge about things should be!<br />
<br />
Some people laugh with the fact that they are asking Paladins! it's possible that this way of working is doomed to fail, but it can show some things we didn't notice before.<br />
<br />
I realized in the last few blues that Blizzard is working on a grander scale than I expected. They really want to change classes, they are pursuing dreams that are amazing. But they realized it requires a lot of errors, feedback, trial... in order to achieve what they want.<br />
<br />
They learned a lot from TBC and never forget that things in beta are ALWAYS subject to change, and if you don't approve anything try to read the oppions of others first and afterwards you can complain or maybe see that some ideas aren't as bad as you thought!<br />
<br />
Truth is perception and exists out of multiple parts!</div></div><hr />

well said, but imo you are abit optimistic<br />
<br />
there are issues, which are adressed even from preBC times and still not fixed, which makes me think, why? if they tried and failed... well, it that time, they should have it done several times already, if its technically not possible, then they should just say so</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Only they didn't rebudget the items, they just changed the str -&gt; ap. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I hardly see it as a nerf. I was more afraid that the gear would stay how it is.. with str=1 ap. Even with agi also = 1 ap to make up for it, think of how much ap would be lost with the str change. At least with it being changed to 2 ap first, none is lost (besides bok of course.. but then again bok works for agi/int as well.)</div></div><hr />

have u checked those 5mans drops? BT t6 will last u well into mid 70s, SWP gear prolly till 80, excluding some weapons, those seem to get pretty nice upgrades when leveling</div></div><hr />

<br />
I forsee all gear being reduced to whether it is cloth, leather, mail, or plate. Spell power and attack power will be combined into just power. Strength and agility will be removed as they will be a percentage based off your gear's &quot;power&quot;. Spirit will replace int for determining your mana pool for leather, mail, and plate. All gear will have haste and hit rating cause God knows how annoying it is for a holy priest to MC an npc just to get resisted.<br />
<br />
So by the end all gear will be like:<br />
<br />
Some Random Drop<br />
Binds when picked up<br />
(Body Part) Cloth/Leather/Mail/Plate<br />
+#Armor<br />
+#Stamina<br />
+#Spirit<br />

Equip: Improves haste rating by #.<br />

doesn't really matter. These restat's should happen in the next live patch, not WotLK. These were needed when they modified enhance 2 months ago, not 4 months from now.<br />

yea, well, basically its true, but even in tbc, with crappy MC/ZG/AQ20 gear, 13 items lasted me till 70 and like 5 of them through most of the kara :/<br />
<br />
im just saying, u will stick with t6 for, if not for month, than for several weeks, since leveling wont be as fast, only if you are one of those &quot;nolifers&quot; with 15h/day for wow :)</div></div><hr />
