As some of you may already be aware, we will not be renewing the World of Warcraft: The Trading Card Game license with Upper Deck. We want to assure you that we are committed to supporting the TCG, and players can look forward to new content and strong organized play support in the near future. We will share additional details about the game’s transition to a new partner as soon as possible. For those awaiting tournament prizes, we will ensure you receive them. <br />
Now, what does it really mean for the future of WoW: TCG? At this point we don't really know what will happen to the current version of the Trading Card Game, we can just assume that your Spectral Tiger card will be worth &quot;the price of a small car on ebay&quot; in a couple of years. However, if you're only interested in the mount, you might want to wait a little before you buy everything you can. <br />
<br />
About two years ago, Slouken (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Lantinga) slowly left World of Warcraft to start working on an &quot;unnanounced project&quot;, at this point I just assumed it was the unannounced MMO. I was wrong: Blizzard created a new development team in 2008 to work on an online conversion of the World of Warcraft: Trading Card game and Slouken seems to lead the project (or at least the recruitment, according to a few offers he posted online). This new game is most likely why the partnership between UDE and Blizzard died. <br />
<br />
It's really hard to get more details on the game but I wouldn't be surprised if all the old cards were revived online to give new players a chance to acquire them. Of course, just like everything else, nothing is official and you shouldn't believe me until someone in blue actually confirms that. <br />
<br />
12/02 Realm Performance<br />
Some highly populated realms, as well as some realms in highly populated Battlegroups, are currently experiencing performance issues during peak playing hours, which, depending on the realm, can occur both inside and outside instances. This is caused primarily by high concurrent Icecrown Citadel activity, the start of Arena Season 8, the release of the new Vault of Archavon boss encounter and the “Love is in the Air” seasonal event.<br />
<br />
To help address some of these issues, we’ve applied a hotfix to optimise certain database requests during the weekly maintenance, in addition to a variety of other related adjustments. We will continue to monitor the affected realms and will be making further adjustments to continually improve performance where possible. We know the performance issues have been a frustrating inconvenience for the players on these realms -- we very much appreciate your patience while we implement additional short- and long-term solutions. <br />
<br />
US - Urgent Maintenance<br />
We will be performing urgent maintenance on the realms, listed below, to resolve performance issues beginning at 2:00AM PST on February 13th. We anticipate that these realms should be playable by approximately 7:00AM PST.<br />

Icecrown Citadel Hall of Fame - Updated<br />
The Hall of Fame has been updated and I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of the last updates before quite some time, the Lich King's heroic mode brings the difficulty to a whole new level and we might have to wait a few weeks before we see a kill ... except if top guilds manage to surprise us once again. <br />

Edge is having a very good profit with their change format (A game of thrones, Call of cthulu, warhammer invasion...) from lcg to ccg so I wouldn't be surprised if they adopt this new format or even work with Edge to develop a ccg chapter based card game.<br />

<br />
Yeah, some rpg elements like that would be welcome, also I hope that the prices for boosters aren't as high as in real life, since for one thing, you can go on ebay and find nearly any set or single for significantly cheaper than from blizzard currently and secondly, it only works for MTGO since if you complete one of the newer sets completely, you can trade it in for a real life version of it.</div></div><hr />

Legends of Norrath is an online TCG game for EverQuest and EverQuest 2. It came out in late 2007.<br />

The bosses in-game had a chance to drop booster packs and there was a rare chance of getting cards that allowed players to obtain actual in-game items w/ stats for their character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
To clarify that a bit, every mob had a very small chance to drop a virtual booster pack that could be redeemed in the TCG, bosses weren't special. The items from the boosters were just fluff loot cards like the ones you find in the WoW TCG.</div></div><hr />

This could not be further from the truth, but I can't quite think of anything to retort with. Pointing out that this dealender between UDE and Blizzard is the only substance in your arguement that closely resembles sense won't cut it. Pointing out the rest of what you said from the first paragraph doesn't help. And the rest doesn't hold water when you consider that Blizzard's support has been the envy of other MMORPG developing teams for some time now.<br />
<br />
So what do I call you? A bad forum troll? Someone who quit when Ensidia came under fire? Someone who likes or works at UpperDeck, since they did do this exact same smearing with Koonami after they broke up? Someone who got fired from Blizzard and who's making it personal? I don't know. It's a pretty petty shot at Blizzard all the same. :V<br />

Hopefully they're able to relaunch using the same game system. I don't have the time or money these days for CCG's, but I did pick up the starter set and a few boosters for the WoW version, and it's actually pretty well done.

The 3.5 Pathfinder edition (mind you, that's a conglomeration of TSR's original work on the 3E plus work by WotC and Paizo) is probably the golden standard for how to run a tabletop game now. And yes, they, WotC, did make it the more recent versions (2nd and up).

This^^ 3.0/3.5 changed alot of things. No one can tell me they preferred to use negative armor class vs the 3/3.5/pathfinder system. The 3.0/.5 system is much more noob friendly as well. The skills system had some... issues and some of the feats were useless. The biggest issue 3.0/3.5 had/has is conflicts from book to book. BoVD would conflict with the DMs guild, the PHB and they would conflict with the MM3. Since Pathfinder took all of the rules and put it in one book there are little to no conflicts.<br />
<br />
As for 4th ed. it is terrible. No flexibility, the game seems to have lost... personality.</div></div><hr />

D&amp;D 3rd cleaned up an awful, awful lot of stuff from 2nd which really needed cleaning up. 3.5 was...unnecessary and somewhat damaging. I freely admit I'm a OGL RPG author, incidentally, as well as a games dev, which leads me to...<br />

What the flipping heck was the thought process beyond 4th? It's less suitable for PC versions than 3rd, practically requires a board and most crucially is effectively another RPG with the same name.<br />

Pathfinder, although I consider many of their changes sub-optimal, is where my path lies simply because they're supporting effectively D&amp;D OGL/3.75.
