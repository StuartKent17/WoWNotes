We need all baseline spells buffed, some of those talent changes are also completely useless. Fury of Elune and stellar drift are decent.<br />
<br />
But hey, if you're okay with remaining mediocre and being one of the lowest classes on the charts, (assuming other classes are actually being played well) you do you man.</div></div><hr />

It's not really PC IMO. More like out of character with the rest of Blizzard flavor text. It's not really funny, but realistically violent.

Humor is subjective, i found it funny. <br />

By realistically violent, I mean something that actually happens. No one kicks live gnomes in real life or shoots squirrels out of bows or fights orcs.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I don't have a problem with the name. People throw darts at pictures of people they don't like or burn pictures or other things, but the name and the text take out all of the nuance and just make it cruel.  &quot;Ex Boyfriend Dummy&quot; is funny, but with flavor text about stabbing IRL ex-boyfriend, not so funny.

If the creator did not think it would be funny, he wouldnt have made it. You honestly dont think blizzard changed it because they went from &quot;hehe thats a bit funny&quot; to &quot;no wait, this is wrong, this is very very wrong, bad blizzard&quot; in a few days.<br />

We are not playing a life simulator, it's wow. Anything that touches on issues that people may or may not have encountered in their real lives, in this case, domestic violence can hit a bit close to home - that's realistically violent. People don't walk around with swords anymore cutting each other up and no one casts spells - so it's easy to say it's just fantasy.<br />
<br />
Whether you interpret it to be unoffensive because it's a male on the receiving end is irrelevant. You have been culturally engineered to think that way. Man big and strong like OX e.t.c<br />
<br />
Generally games avoid making the player the focal point of abusive situations, you may see it but very rarely are you actually involved. A game where you had to systematically stab your partner to death would be banned.<br />

Yep, a warlock.<br />
<br />
Only a mage could receive a 42!!!% baseline buff on his biggest dps spell and a 20% minimum baseline dmg increase on everything and still complain.<br />
Because only a mage is used to getting nerfs reversed overnight.<br />
Only mage forums are flooded with blue posts on every change.<br />
Only a mage would be seeing the dev team doing their best to tune them and fix them while ignoring most other classes and be unhappy.<br />
Spoiled class.</div></div><hr />

You mean 12% on pyroblast? And minimum -10% overall baseline nerf(including fireball and pyro buff)? With the crit-nerf they report 100k less dmg on dummies on this build vs the old wich also was a huge nerf. What the hell are you talking about?</div></div><hr />

No no no, you have to do what they do in middle schools and younger in the US. Remove the holiday because it's not fair to kids who don't have a little girl/boy friend. Also demand that there be a hanukkah gnome, kwanzaa troll and athiest gobblin added to the christmas event. They should also remove halloween since it's promoting evil and pirate day since it's promoting raping and pillaging....in a game based on demoincally powered orcs who came to this planet to rape pillage and plunder being behind 3 wars where many have died horrible deaths, also where the last 3 expansions had Death in dragon form who used grimm batol as a dragon rape factory in the past woke up to kill 1000's of people and make a new dragon rape factory right to Orc Hitler and his final solution right to human demonic sacrifices on another world where goat people were being slaughtered.<br />

They were pressured to do so, just look at all the PC threads.<br />
<br />
I'm sure at least one guy thought it was funny just like you did, but as a group, the devs did not think it was funny enough. I don't think Blizzard wants to portray themselves as encouraging this type of violence, so when people point it out, they realize 1) that it is there (because I doubt everyone knows every item and text in the game) and 2) that it is not in the character of their game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is NOT what happened, and I'm sick of people painting it as the story. A father commented in a thread that he felt the pose was not in character for Tracer, and that he thought the sexualization of that particular character was not in keeping with Tracer's personality. Blizzard agreed with the point and stated they would modify it.<br />
<br />
Then some people got upset with the change, claiming Blizzard was buckling to pressure, and went overboard in their criticism. THAT, in turn, is what got the wider SJW/Feminist/Progressive personalities involved in arguing with the 'anti-PC gamers' (for lack of a better term). Then, as usual, the two sides completely forgot about what they were arguing about, and then proceeded to tear each other apart.<br />
<br />
I watched it happen in near real-time, and it infuriates me that we're so easily baited into assuming the worst out of every situation, and that any change a company makes HAS to be because of PC pressure, and not because they legitimately think it's a better fit for their game. Then, when people go overboard and start threatening peoples LIVES over it, they act surprised when people call them on it.</div></div><hr />

You cannot 100% trust what is written here.<br />
It is just datamining.<br />
<br />
But if you want to check what is in the new build, you can also have a look at your spec in the PTR talent simulator.<br />
<br />
For example, it is not obviously written in the new patchnote, but if I look at the talent simulator for fire mage, molten armor (+10% crit rate + physical damage reduction) is back on lvl 50 baseline capacity. - would mean no more crit rate nerf for fire mage ? surprising.</div></div><hr />

More Warlock nerfs.<br />
What's new?<br />
Cannot even pretend to negatively touch the &quot;golden child&quot;. Cannot even pretend to attempt to fix the pariah classes. <br />
Sigh.. Why do I even bother? This negativity has really started to get to me.<br />
<br />
lol phoenix flame was buffed but that is a small increase and you'll never see it as a large part of any Mages damage. It basically helps us proc pyro's and does a little bit aoe. The Bracers being nerfed down to 200% make them worthless so they bumped it to 250% which still isn't the 300% it is now and just barely makes the bracers worth using and even then single target wise Fire Mages get eaten up by just about everybody.<br />
<br />
Mages are mediocre right now.<br />

Only a mage could receive a 42!!!% baseline buff on his biggest dps spell and a 20% minimum baseline dmg increase on everything and still complain.<br />

<br />
lol please tell me you are talking about phoenix flames because it just shows how bad you are and how little you know about Mages. hahahaha<br />
<br />
Mages are not OP by any means at all- especially fire mages. Bad players think that Mages are OP but in reality they are mediocre at best and I have numbers, charts, and facts on my side. Go look at what classes are doing on fights. The only time a fire mage looks good are on fights where we can PAD AoE like Xavius but that is pointless/useless damage.<br />
<br />
Single target Mage gets its ass beat so buffing something that has 3 charges, has a CD, and hits for less then our pyroblast is NOT something that makes much of a difference at all. That small change isn't going to propel fire mages from the middle of the pack to the top. You wanna cry about something then cry about SP's.</div></div><hr />
