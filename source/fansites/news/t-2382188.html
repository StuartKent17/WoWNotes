they will most likely have access to the legion forms, i think they gave these special form to zandalari to compensate for not being able to unlock most of the legion forms</div></div><hr />

The forms are going account wide in BFA so if you have a druid that has them unlocked you can use them as a Zanadlari.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because they realised just how fucked mages are without the legendary item effects from legion so making them 'baseline' talents is the only way forward, and to be honest conflag was a boring talent anyway, it's just more damage for the sake of more damage it doesn't change gameplay or change spells at all.<br />

Lets be realistic here, even if they have big plans for Alliance content, at this current rate and their complete focus on every little detail for the Horde, there's no way they'll have time to make it even remotely fair for the Alliance. It'll be Cata 2.0. at this rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they update moonkin model for Darkspear, I'd be race changing all my druids (that's a lot of druids!). Zandalari have awesome moonkin model, but Darkspear have better models for everything else.<br />
Don't worry<br />
<br />
I'm sure they will implement a glyph where you can change your form to different models if that would ever happen.<br />

Allied races are amazing, but I'm talking about the old races getting more customization too (just like the upright orc). Because when you look at all the races (allied races included) the possibility of creating a unique character, is pretty limited.</div></div><hr />

Allied races are amazing, but I'm talking about the old races getting more customization too (just like the upright orc). Because when you look at all the races (allied races included) the possibility of creating a unique character, is pretty limited.<br />
<br />
There are at least 9-10.000 different combinations and on average there is only a handful of each combination on each server. I think the reason we see lookalikes is partly due to the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon and the fact that not all races are equally played. The different customisation options combined with gear also limits the perceived uniqueness of the chanceters. If you can't differentiate between hair styles and hair colour we are down to only 500ish combinations. <br />
<br />
More hair styles and colours wont solve this. The ability to change the size and &quot;fitness&quot; of the characters could help, but I don't think it will ever happen in WoW.</div></div><hr />

Sorry<br />
Once again I fail to clarify what I actually meant.<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining about a lack of character diversity in wow. Transmog already solved 80% of this issue. I remember during TBC and WOTLK most people would wear the same easy to obtain armour (World of Warcraft: Attack of the clones). I can already have a unique look on my server to differentiate myself from other players.<br />
<br />
What I was actually trying to say, is the lackluster options in the character creation menu. Some races (female Tauren for example) have next to no customization options. New Hairstyles and faces won't contribute anything to player distinction, but for a lot of players, this can make the difference of playing a race or not.<br />
<br />
As for size and fitness:<br />
I wouldn't be so sure about that. Upright orcs, advanced physics and armor that isn't just bodypaint seemed to be something impossible a few years ago.</div></div><hr />

Lets be realistic here, even if they have big plans for Alliance content, at this current rate and their complete focus on every little detail for the Horde, there's no way they'll have time to make it even remotely fair for the Alliance. It'll be Cata 2.0. at this rate.<br />

That actually doesn't have anything to do with what I was talking about<br />
<br />
New class doesn't progress through old raids and doesn't need old raid sets. Most likely any new class will also be hero class and will start atleast at 110+ from here on to avoid making a class hall for them in Legion(which would be a huge undertaking and breaks the lore)<br />

A new class combo that has to go through Legion to progress, would get artifacts... it's the most integral part of the expansion, so would they be able to unlock unique skins? That's all up to the developer if it's worth it or not.<br />

<br />
According to whom?<br />
<br />
You and your assumed authority on the matter?<br />
<br />
Don't put words in my mouth. I &lt;NEVER&gt; said or even implied that the allied races were the only thing being added or that it was the most important. You literally made that up in your head, applied it to our argument, and then debated it when it wasn't even stated as a point.<br />
<br />
Oh, and, I am entitled to have my thoughts and ideas on the matter without enduring your abuse. If you can't make your point without trying to call the opposition to it &quot;dense&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot; then ....says a lot about your maturity. Grow up.</div></div><hr />

Playable models are not equal to a story you move past after you level or once the new expansion is out. BTW LOVE how you left out green Jesus Cata!<br />
<br />
Everything datamined right now is horde to the point where it's insulting that alliance has nothing. Ye know your next two races, customization options, heritage gear, mounts, totems and druid forms. We know we get DI dwarf with fire beards and can be paladins. No Mount and no idea what our fourth race is. <br />

Now they give Zandalari completely new forms for all druid forms, and people are eating this shit up. Not saying the forms are bad and they shouldn't be given, but honestly I think worgen and troll druid forms should have a remake. Tauren and Night Elf should stay as they are, as they are basically the same type of druidism. Troll druidism is different, and worgen druidism is different as well (harvest magic, basically).</div></div><hr />

The whole Green Jesus storyline was a joke, especially compared to Thrall storyline in WC3. Also, while you indeed outlevel that content at some point, watching your faction getting shafted from all side for variously stupid reasons was not a pleasant experience.<br />

Fourth race will most likely be Kul'Tiras humans.<br />

We've been shafted since Crapaclysm on a regular basis. EMFH alone (from 3.0.2 to 7.0.3 that's 4 major versions) was a shaft bigger than Sargeras' sword.<br />
And if it was Stormwind getting destroyed in MOP, Alliance players would probably commit seppuku in front of Blizzard HQ.<br />

WoW stills suffers terribly from the idiotic Tolkien-esque &quot;humans and elves = good, orcs = bad&quot; stereotype. Which was already retarded when that book was written.</div></div><hr />

Although Warhammer Fantasy Lizardmen steal from those sources, Blizzard have directly stolen from Warhammer Fantasy Lizardmen. Far too many elements and similarities exist. <br />

The theft is obvious, disgusting derivative trash, but it's what everyone has come to expect from this hack company at this point. Over the course of Blizzards history, all they have ever done is steal something from somewhere, dumb it down and simplify it, they almost never create from scratch, opting to steal pre-established things from pre-established worlds, even things like the Emerald Dream are stolen from other works.</div></div><hr />

For real wtf is that thing. I'm also at a loss how they miss the obvious choices for these things we can all see from the game. <br />
<br />
New art assets are great, but when they look like this ehhh....I'd take a raptor recolor, a warbear recolor or a spider as some pointed out, laser bird is always going to be a trashform. <br />

<br />
I think of zul-gurub and would think that their druid forms would be -&gt; Bat (flying), Panther (feral), Raptor (Travel), Snake (Aquatic), War-bear, or even Spider (guardian).<br />
<br />
Different loas. The ones in Zul'Gurub are from loas that the Jungle trolls revere, the ones in Zul'Aman, for the Forest troll.<br />
<br />
The Zandalari has other loas, which seem to be mostly dinosaurs.<br />

lol. &quot;Another Alliance centered expansion&quot;<br />
<br />
You can argue that Legion might have thrown a few bones to the Alliance this time with the focus on night elves... but lo-and behold, guess who just got nightborne as a playable race in Legion?<br />
<br />
Legion, the expansion that was almost an Alliance themed expansion. Would have been the first since WotLK, and even that expansion had some heavy Horde themes (so as not to offend its overly sensitive general Horde playerbase).<br />
<br />
Don't worry though, your fears are vindicated because BfA will almost certainly have stronger Horde content than Alliance will. Zandalar alone is going to be amazing, and despite dark iron dwarves being bamfs IMO, the Zandalari trolls will by far be the most popular non-elven allied race (and maybe even then, I'm guessing they'll even beat nightborne in popularity).<br />
<br />
PS: If it's not obvious, this post is mostly tongue-in-cheek. I'm excited about both versions of content, but there is no way I could respond seriously to a post that thinks Horde never get to be the focus of an expansion. It's just ludicrous, lol, and there is literally nothing implying Sylvanas will either be a big bad, nor that the expansion will remotely lead to Alliance having better content. Even on the beta, Kul Tiras is supposedly boring compared to Zandalar, and this isn't a surprise to me.<br />

I'm kind of disappointed how little people are commenting on the zandalari cat forms. Personally I like it, but hey, that's just my biased opinion.<br />
<br />
Fortunately if you like the bear form but hate the cat form (or vice versa, or whatever) you can use the artifact form appearances. And this works especially well in the Zandalari troll's favor, since IMO, the artifact cat form looks like it was designed with trolls in mind. Looks like a colorful tiger with huge fangs.<br />
<br />
Personally, if I play Horde for a druid this expansion, it would without question be Zandalari and again, in my biased opinion, that cat form looks great. I'd play it.</div></div><hr />
