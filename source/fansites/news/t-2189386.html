Would make sense except KJ is the final boss of Tomb and well.... blizz would catch worse shit than the Real ID fiasco if they reused the same boss in two raids back to back.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it'd even be considered a steal considering leaked voice lines indicate he'll be a part of the fight and Velen has far, far, far more right to the KJ killing blow than anybody else in the Warcraft universe does.<br />
<br />
But of course whiny autists who need to feel like a hero in a virtual world to make up for being a failure in real life will bitch and moan anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's a demon, and holds high ranking within the Burning Legion. Sargeras knows Kil'jaeden is inferior to him; he won't smite him for a snide comment that hardly borders on defiance (although he might be looking for an excuse if his response is any indication).<br />

Remember that the eredar were recruited through charisma, not intimidation. Furthermore, from KJ's talk, it seems like he is losing faith in Sargeras. Therefore, it is not unthinkable that Kil'jaeden honestly believes that he could take on Sargeras himself (as far as we know, the eredar might have never seen Sargeras' real body or what he is able of, he might have basically been a &quot;navi&quot; to them)</div></div><hr />

Sargeras body was destroyed in the shattering and his body will take ages to be reconstructed in the twisted nether because his enormous power. Thats why gul`dan was planning to use illidan body as vessel for sargeras soul.</div></div><hr />

He lost his body in War of the Ancients. His spirit is all that remains. Gul'dan tried to use Illiidan's body as a host for Sargeras, but that failed. Sargeras still has no body, thus he has no real power. He's less than a shadow of his former self.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I get that feeling he's losing faith too especially when he talks about paying with his world. He sacrificed his world and his people for the promise of immense power and doesn't have much left to show for it especially now that Archimonde is gone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since they didn't mention it in chronicles and his... world-sized foot crossing into azeroth via a portal doesn't seem to be a very logical picture, I am leaning towards assuming that that specific part of WotA didn't happen. But then again, you are right in mentioning the illidan posession making no sense otherwise - maybe because Sargeras' titanic ass not fitting in one of those legion spaceships?</div></div><hr />

not hypey, it was basically just a conversation, not what they usually have 7.1 was a better teaser trailer compared to this, not just because it showed the actual content as opposed to a quite meaningless talk between two guys, which didnt give us much other than stuff we have known since TBC, KJ pointing to Argus simply to show it in the trailer. which is just there to add hype. the stuff at the end with the ships was stupid as there are just some ships in 7.2 and makes you question stuff, because well if they wanted to fucking take Azeroth they would have just sent a gazilion ships already.</div></div><hr />

I am positive about alot of things but that has nothing to do with the fact that this trailer was one of their worse. As for looking into things too deep, Well Thanks. I take that as a compliment considering the trailer hasnt been out for long.<br />

its fucking stupid to have 10-25 nobodies kill kil'jaedan and such, so i agree about the failure irl, they're pretty stupid.<br />
<br />
So, while I am 100% fine with lore characters, especially where it makes sense, getting the kill; pretending we're still just simple adventurers is a bit silly. Have you played this game? I mean, I've played for 12 years. My character was a simple adventurer in Vanilla. He probably could have been considered a veteran adventurer in Burning Crusade. I'm pretty sure after taking down the Lich King he rose to a bit higher than &quot;simple adventurer&quot;, but even pass that...through MoP and then WoD, he became a major commander of the Horde. Even controlled a whole garrison. Now he's technically the leader of a Class Order Hall.<br />
<br />
I think your idea of &quot;simple adventurer&quot; doesn't really work anymore.</div></div><hr />

Lol Wowboys cant handle critisism. Of course I watched it and it didn't really hype me anything like the previous cinematics before, aside from the garrison update. It does really not showcase anything that is coming to the next patch like most of the trailers before it, with clips of the different raids, zones etc. &quot;BAM! NEW RAID! WATCH A FEW CLIPS ABOUT HOW AWESOME THE ECOUNTERS IS!&quot; &quot;BAM! NEW BROKENSHORE QUESTLINE!&quot;. And the way Kil'jaeden talks made it seem like he was talking to himself then suddenly sargeras pops out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
Im simply stating my opinion, and my opinion is that the lore of legion is complete garbage. Untill they stop pulling another kerrigan this ship cannot be saved. Everyone who lurks on the starcraft forums regularly knows of the shitfest that enveloped after the epilogue, and the same will happen in wow unless they stop the unneccessary fan service. &quot;Oh you know illidan is the good guy after genociding the entire population of outland and ruled it worse than Maghteridon!&quot; Suddenly we're the bad guys and get yelled at for killing a tyrant.</div></div><hr />

You can have your opinion, but it doesn't mean you are immune to criticism. Also calling people &quot;Wow fanboys&quot; is not an argument either.</div></div><hr />

His spirit is all that remains. Gul'dan tried to use Illiidan's body as a host for Sargeras, but that failed. Sargeras still has no body, thus he has no real power. He's less than a shadow of his former self.<br />
<br />
Source on this? I read War of the Ancients and the Chronicles Vol. 1 but do not remember anywhere saying his body was destroyed. The portal imploded and knocked him back into the Nether instead of Azeroth, but I don't remember his body being destroyed. Even if the body he was occupying at the time was destroyed, it's unlikely it was actually his body. There's no way that Sargeras was going to enter into Azeroth with his actual body. The Titans were too big to even go to Azeroth. That's why he used an avatar (which we fight in ToS) to come to Azeroth before...</div></div><hr />

His first apperance was in warcraft 3 after Maiev ran trough the tomb of sargeras where we saw his &quot;Avatar&quot;. Then his voice was in Wrath of the lich king during the siege of the undercity, and then we heard his voice again in the lights heart questline</div></div><hr />

Their power levels are a million light years apart, what makes him think he can get away with that?<br />
<br />
sargeras is like sauron for WoW, he has no physical form right now so while in this state, even though vastly more powerful than any being currently in existence save for the titan soul of azeroth, kil'jaeden can in some measure be a little cheeky to him and not face retribution for the time being at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whether it's been retconned or not by now I'm not sure, but Archimonde always wanted to usurp Sargeras somehow. The world tree was supposed to be that path. Then again Archimonde was never good as shown in the demo lock artifact lore where he literally betrayed Thakiel to get a spot as a ruler and then still was summoning the same demons he got him in trouble for doing which attracted Sargeras.</div></div><hr />

Kil'Jaeden literally has nothing, he has achieved basically nothing. He has no allies, no world, no strong victory.<br />

I'd be having second thoughts too. It's not like Sargeras can give his strongest minion a bitch slap either. Sargeras would be fucked without Kil'Jaeden.</div></div><hr />

Eh, they'll just go about it like do they do dalaran: The wrath zones and the legion zones exist in 2 different times, when you enter the legion zones you're effectively going back to a time when the Lich King still lives or yata yata, unless it serves lore to throw you out there during a time when its the &quot;New&quot; Lich King (most of the DK campaign stuff)</div></div><hr />

Well, then your opinion is wrong. How is it wrong? Cause you tried to compare WOW to starcraft, the Most laughable attempt of hating WOW i've ever seen....<br />

Illidan isn't kerrigan. infact, you don't even know what kerrigan as a xel'naga is....<br />

She was a villain with a backstory, that was made a hero....<br />

Why is it that KJ seems basically fed up with the Legion? Is the over arcing story going to be about the Void Lords, in the end? Because, KJ seems like he gave Argus for a reason. Not just for power, neither. That reason is the Void Lords.<br />

<br />
This is a brand new meaning to the &quot;it's done when it's done&quot;. Announcements some time ahead but 4 days.. Really?<br />
I mean i guess there shouldn't be any reason to complain that content is coming more regularly. It's cool<br />
But i think this might be rushing things a bit. What's going to be waiting at us after 7.3 or 7.4 depending when Legion is dealt with, another year of no content, cause the pacing seems to rush things now.<br />
Barely just got in to Nighthold, don't even have 4set yet, just barely 2set. It's a bit wonky, when we basically just got to the launch tier. EN and ToV were tier 0.5 and NH is finally the full launch tier, 6 months after release. Then Gul'dan has been open what 3 weeks on lfr and 7.2 is already pushing out the tier 2 content 4 weeks after that. First 6 months to get to tier 1 and then month or month and half until tier 2 is out. Well the Tomb is not coming out at 4 weeks after Gul'dan at least, but a shit ton of other stuff to do is, when there's shit ton of other daily stuff to do already. <br />
Thought this would be at least month or two away. Thought we'd have some time to play other mains and some alts in between and get them caught up before the next major main grind comes along.<br />
Apparently not.<br />
Efforts must be doubled, there's a gazillion things to be grinded and finished in 4 days. Goodbye sleep, life and anything beyond.<br />
Need.. More.. Time..</div></div><hr />

2. .....Seriously? We already know that Kil'jaeden's going to die, and the fact that Velen's not going to Argus in 7.3...<br />

Pretty sure Velen is coming to Argus actually, they are repairing the Exodar for that exact reason which they set up at the end of the Exodar scenario when you click the Hearthstone item you got. <br />
<br />
And I have no idea where people are getting the theory that Sargeras does not have a body when all we've ever faced has been his avatars. <br />
He has probably infused Argus with so much fel that he himself has become the planet's &quot;soul&quot; at this point.</div></div><hr />

Sargeras works through avatars. He is depicted in smaller forms all the time. He invests these with a portion of his will and power. Basically the way you control your character on screen.<br />
<br />
What the Night Elves tried to summon to Azeroth was certainly an Avatar. Perhaps the most powerful one he had, but an avatar all the same. An orc cut it with an axe and caused it pain. Do you really believe a being whose skin has mountain ranges on it, a living world, can by injured with an axe? Maybe with a Goblin Mining Operation. :P<br />

Either way. In the Well of Eternity book this avatar was destroyed as the well collapsed. In the Chronicles book it states &quot;Sargeras was ripped back into the Twisting Nether&quot;. As the latest canon, that means that either way, even if you believe it was Sargeras' true body, Sargeras the Titan should be fine.<br />

<br />
We all know, Sunwell was merely a setback.<br />
<br />
Legion is finally showing the full potential of the franchise if storytelled as it deserves, i am loving nearly everything in it, but it has one very big failure wich is the gameplay and development of many classes, from what i read, but mine in particular, at least in my opinion: Warlocks have been drained of flavour, its gameplay flattened, its mechanics dumbed.<br />
Demonology in particular, have been raped and forgotten, its rotations are single minded and utterly frustrating, and its abilities are totally unrewarding by many points of view( gameplay, visual, lorewise, its been a total downgrade) a shame if you consider the potential synergies this exp may have.<br />
<br />
I played a DH, and I loved its gameplay, but this fuels my anger even more, because it proves that Blizz can still build solid and enjoyable gameplay for WoW if its developers really want it...and with this i am not arguin anything against that class, i am just questioning why they did such a bad work with other classes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faenlyn</div><div class="date">2017-03-24, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, I get that feeling he's losing faith too especially when he talks about paying with his world. He sacrificed his world and his people for the promise of immense power and doesn't have much left to show for it especially now that Archimonde is gone.<br />
<br />
<br />
It wasnt necessarily for immense power. Someone doesnt usually say they sacrificed their world for power and say it with anger and regret as he was pointing to his shattered world. Plus he specifically said it was for the sake of their &quot;crusade&quot;. <br />
<br />
The lore theory since the existence of the Voidlords has been revealed is that Sargeras led the Titans' fight against the Voidlords but he lost faith that their approach was winning as he saw more and more Titan spirit - planets being corrupted by the Old Gods and turned in service of the Void. He believed the approach of the Titans was too naive and doomed to fail. He already had to destroy one Titan spirit planet by cleaving it in half to prevent it from becoming corrupted by its Old God infection. Azeroth is especially important to them because it is the most powerful Titan spirit in existance and it falls to the corruption of the Old Gods that have infected it, the Void Lords would have an enormous advantage. They believe that they must destroy Azeroth and all other Titan spirit planets before the Old Gods corrupt them and empower the Voidlords. Eventually the Voidlords with enough corrupted Titan world spirits would manifest themselves from the Void into creation and the universe would be destroyed. <br />
<br />
Sargeras decided that the only way to save the Universe would be to destroy it. To burn it all to prevent the Voidlords from getting it and then starting fresh in re-creating it. He called this plan the Burning Crusade and he recruited allies such as KJ to help him. Essentially he believes the planets have been too corrupted by the Void Lords parasites, the Old Gods to be saved. You have to destroy them all and start fresh. As KJ says he sacrificed his world in order to further Sargeras' vision and crusade however he is starting to doubt whether he can carry it off. <br />
<br />
They honestly believe that if they fail in their Burning Crusade, the universe will be overrun by the Voidlords and destroyed. They dont think the Titans and the Naaru can save the world with their too naive and failing method of figihting the Void. They see themselves not as evil but as self sacrificing for the greater good and thats why he is angry that they are failing</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MakeMeLaugh</div><div class="date">2017-03-24, 02:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sargeras still has his Titan body. His actual form is the size of a planet. You can't summon a planet to a planet. Hell, the Well of Eternity might have been able to summon his little toe at most.<br />
<br />
Sargeras works through avatars. He is depicted in smaller forms all the time. He invests these with a portion of his will and power. Basically the way you control your character on screen.<br />
<br />
What the Night Elves tried to summon to Azeroth was certainly an Avatar. Perhaps the most powerful one he had, but an avatar all the same. An orc cut it with an axe and caused it pain. Do you really believe a being whose skin has mountain ranges on it, a living world, can by injured with an axe? Maybe with a Goblin Mining Operation. :P<br />
<br />
Either way. In the Well of Eternity book this avatar was destroyed as the well collapsed. In the Chronicles book it states &quot;Sargeras was ripped back into the Twisting Nether&quot;. As the latest canon, that means that either way, even if you believe it was Sargeras' true body, Sargeras the Titan should be fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, until 7.3 where we blow up Argus in his face like a fel grenade when he shows up. &lt;- my prediction.<br />
<br />
No, until blizz say something different, it's was the actual Sargeras at the other side, and Broxigar did wound the real Sargeras.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point was that it doesn't matter. Sargeras survives is the point I'm trying to make. <br />
<br />
Whether you believe it was Sargeras' true body is another discussion. Realistically, I believe it couldn't have been. But that's not a discussion I believe matters until we get more word of Blizzard on it, as our disagreement shows, there's different ways to interpret it.<br />
<br />
My intent here is to go against those that claim Sargeras' body is destroyed. Which we do have a direct quote to disprove.<br />

I'll quote it again for Axode.<br />

Did you quit the game in vanilla then? Cos spaceships have been in the game since TBC. And Warcraft has /always/ had sci fi elements in it. They weren't as pronounced in Warcraft 1, but they've always been there. I mean how long ago did you quit? If you don't like the game let it go. I mean do you really have nothing else to do with your time other than hang around the forums for a game you apparently haven't played in years? That's weird.</div></div><hr />

This might be the best patch trailer ive ever seen for WoW. Khadgar, Velen, KJ, Dalaran, Argus, Sargeras(!), hinting at getting closer to resolve the most important conflict of Azeroth.

Karazhan and ToV aren't filling the same role. One is a 5-man, and one is a raid - they don't compare, so saying people skipped over one for the other doesn't fit. There were also a few BiS stuff in Karazhan, so people did still run it.<br />
<br />
Regardless, the new raid is not coming out next week when the patch is. They have said multiple times it will be released at a later date. Don't know when, but testing has barely even begun, so we've still got a ways to go.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure these sort of story telling conveniences have always been used by Blizzard. Twisting Nether is a story telling device that makes it so they can keep resurrecting these demonic characters over and over but also have a place to send them away for a long time when they've overstayed their welcome. <br />
<br />
Now the story demanded these ships because they realized demons leaking through slowly in portals isn't very exciting, and also because the Legion had to be &quot;stronger&quot; than before. I bet we get to Argus and they're building a giant sling shot that can launch the planet directly at Azeroth, or something else that's equally dumb. But it won't matter, because there's no where to go from here than eliminating the legion as a threat.</div></div><hr />

It seems like Sargeras was holding Kil'jaeden back from attacking at that moment. I'm fairly certain that Gul'Dan &quot;activating&quot; the Tomb of Sargeras made it much easier for the Legion to teleport to Azeroth in general. And at the Nighthold he was trying to open a rift even more directly to Argus.</div></div><hr />

Gul'dan had to turn on the astronomican... I mean Tomb of Sargeras, so the legion ships could navigate the warp... I mean twisting nether, and pop out right onto Terra... I mean Azeroth.<br />
<br />
But seriously, the introduction of &quot;spacecraft&quot; like this with this expansion produces a whole new set of questions and missed opportunities. Why are these ships flying low enough for us to reach them? We've seen them shoot stuff, why don't they move up to low orbit where we can't reach them and just nuke us from there? They could've invited a few guys from the starcraft team to show them how this stuff works. So many more questions.</div></div><hr />

No, he couldn't have. He's only able to now, because Gul'dan unlocked the original power of the Tomb of Sargeras to bridge the gap between KJ and Azeroth. <br />

Well if the legion is as big as blizz let us belive than they dont need to shoot far, if thousends of those shooting in lowerorbit with fellfire all would be corupted in no time. <br />
<br />
but as far we seen atm the strategic craft of the legion is laughable, only one bridgehead no secoundary reinforcement´s or outposts of any worth . also its to centered on the broken isle for an effective invasion an focused attack on the portal could bring all down, no real sabotage efforts only some halfarsed infiltration´s and assassination atempts.. call me entiteld but thats no real invasion.</div></div><hr />

[QUOTE=Igzorn;45111903]Well if the legion is as big as blizz let us belive than they dont need to shoot far, if thousends of those shooting in lowerorbit with fellfire all would be corupted in no time. <br />
<br />
but as far we seen atm the strategic craft of the legion is laughable, only one bridgehead no secoundary reinforcement´s or outposts of any worth . also its to centered on the broken isle for an effective invasion an focused attack on the portal could bring all down, no real sabotage efforts only some halfarsed infiltration´s and assassination atempts.. call me entiteld but thats no real invasion.<br />
<br />
I totally agree with you the invasion is a bit meh compare of the novel but they did great as for a game experience you cant destroy city and landmass as player dont want there old content desroyed but we will wait and see there full power in argus blizz can use full eredar legion art not elf orc mix legion</div></div><hr />

Righteous retribution, though, is perfectly legitimate!<br />

Well I think they are technically classified as inter-dimensional ships. I'm not sure they actually fly around or that they mainly just teleport. I haven't really seen any move at any reasonable speed.</div></div><hr />
