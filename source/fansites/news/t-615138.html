Eh, the enhance tree has a great 'flow' with the Elemental tree. It's sad (as an elemental shaman) to see important changes in our tree which reflect on enhancement shamans, while we get nothing out of Restoration or Enhancement even.</div></div><hr />

It probably means more damage (and threat) when you have tons of haste affecting you. Your dps goes up when hasted even though the weapon dmg stays the same. That sounds like something geared for raiders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
at this point i'd rather have nerfs to neat and usable talents instead of being like some class / specs that have gotten one or two new spells, no new mechanics, and nerfs to their already existing spells. overpowered to slightly less overpowered is golden compared to that.</div></div><hr />

Shame though, 100% chance would be like 5 talent points.<br />
<br />
Now it's about 2, and instead of ~40 dps at lvl 70, it's about 10. Not too amazing, not too bad.<br />
About equal to 20 AP = 1/2 gem socket. Far, FAR behind in comparative dps increase gains to the other professions.<br />

At least getting your own faction mounts and flying mounts will get you to about 35, so you're halfway there.<br />

Elemental Shaman:<br />
Call of Thunder (1 Talent) (moved down to tier 5): Increases the critical strike chance of your Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning and Thunderstorm spells by an additional 5%.<br />
Elemental Fury (5 talent up from 1) (Moved to tier 3): Increases the critical strike damage bonus of your Searing, Magma, and Fire Nova Totems and your Fire, Frost, and Nature spells by 20,40,60,80,100%.<br />
Enhancement Shaman:<br />
Mental Quickness is now at tier 8<br />
Unleashed Rage is now at tier 6<br />
Weapon Mastery is only 3 ranks now 4/7/10%<br />
New Talent - Lava Lash: You charge your off-hand weapon with lava, instantly dealing 100% off-hand Weapon damage. Damage is increased by 25% if your off-hand weapon is enchanted with Flametongue.<br />
4% of base mana, 5 yd range, Instant cast, 6 sec cooldown<br />
Replaced Talent - Earthen Power: Your Earthbind Totem has a 50/100% chance to also remove all snare effects from you and nearby friendly targets when it pulses.<br />
<br />
Restoration: <br />
Spirit Link: You link the friendly target with up to two nearby friendly targets, causing 50% of any damage taken to be distributed to the linked targets. If any target takes a blow greater than 30% of their health, or shared damage would reduce a target's health below 20%, the link is broken. A member of the link moving beyond 100 yards or being the target of an effect which breaks on taking damage will also break the link. You can only have one link active at a time.<br />
4% of base mana, 40 yd range, Instant cast, 10 sec cooldown<br />
<br />
Tidal Waves: You have a 20/40/60/80100% chance after you cast Chain Heal to lower the cast time of your next Lesser Healing Wave or Healing Wave spell by 30%. In addition, your Healing Wave gains an additional 4/8/12/16/20% of your bonus healing effects and your Lesser Healing Wave gains an additional 2/4/6/8/10% of your bonus healing effects.<br />
-Down from 25% each.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Awakening: When you critically heal with your Healing Wave or Lesser Healing Wave, you summon an Ancestral spirit to aid you, instantly healing the lowest percentage health friendly party or raid target within 40 yards for 10/20/30% of the amount healed.<br />
-Reduced from 20/40/60%<br />

Heh ow forgot about the AV mount 69 xD. But PVP mounts, CE, all hordie race mounts, Brewfest mount, AV mount, talbuks, netherrays, netherdrakes, norma. That should be about it. Let me recount it to be sure:<br />
1 AV<br />
5 PvP<br />
1 Brewfest<br />
1 CE<br />
4 Epic Flyers<br />
3 Normal flyers<br />
5 Netherrays<br />
6 Netherdrakes<br />
1 Normal enginering flyer<br />
1 Epic enginering flyer<br />
4 Level 30 Hawkstriders<br />
3 Level 60 Hawkstriders<br />
2 Level 30 Kodos<br />
3 Level 60 Kodos<br />
3 Level 30 UC Horses<br />
2 Level 60 UC Horses<br />
3 Level 30 Wolves<br />
3 Level 60 Wolves<br />
3 Level 40 Raptors<br />
2 Level 60 Raptors<br />
8 Talbuks<br />
<br />
Hmm that counts for 64. Should get the rep for CE and 3 horde cities but that should be easy. Getting the Halaa talbuks gets it up to 66. Dunno about the AQ40 mounts tho but heared it's worth checking out :).</div></div><hr />

TBH, if they are only making the albino available if you got 75 mounts, you must have spend a crapload of cash so far. It should at least be 310% speed for that sort of achievement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Summons and dismisses a rideable Grand Caravan Mammoth. This is a very fast mount that can carry 3 passengers and vendors.<br />
Vendors on your mount? hold on, what's up with that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Without a counterbalancing drawback, how could going from 2 100 DPS one-handers to 2 140 DPS two-handers (to take BC as an example) possibly be a DPS nerf? Not to mention more than doubling your weapon top-end, and therefore your instant weapon damage skills' hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the single pulls are not hard to solo now for non mana using tanks.<br />
the four pulls are not hard for a group of four to kill given a tank, healer, two dps.<br />
going in and killing the single pulls over and over was how I finally got the red bug (there are three that you can single pull before first boss you just have to be careful about getting past the four pat, i.e. hug the wall).<br />

Booooo.... although you can still get the red mount the way I described solo or with the smallest group imaginable, only thing to worry about is the mana syphon explosion of Obsidian Eradicators. Respawn timer 30 minutes. You can also spam kill three out of four of the Anubisath Sentinel, loot and then exit the instance with one still alive and all four will repop.</div></div><hr />

Also you have to take into consideration the fact that certain horde are going to have access to 4 Brewfest mounts (at least, Direbrew is supposed to drop some kind of mount as well this year according to Blizzard's page) as they had access to the rams last year, and will have access to the kodo this year as well.

They just keep on beating the snot out of this spell, until it just will become useless, won't they ? ::) ::)<br />
<br />
In the latest build Flourish (Wild Growth is a retarded name, I refuse to use it) already replaced Lifebloom in any group bigger then 3 people, now it will even more so. Also, props to Blizzard on rendering such a needed talent as Gift of the Earthmother completely useless. Now that I have to waste talent points in Nature's Grace to assist in the Regrowth spamming which Blizzard pigeonholed as into again, can we at least make Improved Tranquility viable by making the talent grant the spell to affect the entire raid ? <br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
This change to Gift of the Earthmother also made Nourish completely unused, so they also happen to renamed the wrong talent. Good job, good job!<br />

I've never given it much thought, but two questions does spring to mind when reading the above:<br />
1. Can Taurens and the tiny races buy mounts that are not intended for them?<br />
2. Can Taurens and the tiny races &quot;learn&quot; mounts that are not intended for them?<br />
That they can't summon them regardless of whether the answer is &quot;yes&quot; to any of the above is given, but...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is sad, but maybe intended.<br />
<br />
Also, I can imagine the threat drop only works when the target actually has aggro, else the warrior (possibly in a MT position) would need to spam this on the currently highest Damagedealer, which could cause problems on fights which require positioning of the mob/boss.</div></div><hr />

Yep, I still get daily &quot;wtf is that mount&quot; whispers. <br />
It does get bothersome though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
and its balanced around taurens = taurens will have it hard, all other will just buy 15-20 more faction mounts and get their flying white rat alot easier</div></div><hr />

Blackened Naaru Sliver (lvl 70): 44AP stacking 10 times (lasts 20sec), 440 AP at max stacks and 54 passive haste rating.<br />
<br />
What gives?The Battle Trance of the Blackened Naaru Sliver does not always happen. The wording of Fury of the Five Fights sounds as if the second you start punching/chopping/stabbing/shooting a target, you start accumulating AP/RAP, very much like the Darkmoon Card: Crusade.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I see this as making OT warriors a spamable threat dump for high threat dps classes. Still don't know if that utility is worth losing the benefit of being able to help keep the MT alive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Improved Thunderclap increases damage done by Thunderclap by 10/20/30%. (Old - 40/70/100%)<br />
<br />
Won't flip out until I test it, but it certainly seems like a firm kick in the junk to last build's AoE tanking ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Their Shadow and Flame now also increases Chaos Bolt dps, that other talent making SOulfire instant cast and cost no mana/soulshard.<br />
<br />
And yes, i am making here a comparison with mages, flame me for it if you want but looking at their new talents it's clear they are going to be similiar:<br />
<br />
Emp Fireball: only increases fireball, not scorch-pyro-blast wave-DB-LB<br />
<br />
Hot streak: our instant pyro does require mana<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
You're fucking retarded. Pyro =/= Chaos Bolt, which is the only spell S&amp;F would affect at the same time as your main nuke. You don't use incinerate and shadowbolt with the same spec. Period.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aldo: Holy shit is there anything mages DON'T QQ about? You're imba as hell in the Beta, and have been that way for a while. The last build before nerfed the snot out of EVER. SINGLE. CLASS. EXCEPT. MAGES. And you just got BUFFED in this one, AGAIN.<br />
<br />
Ok? Stop fucking crying. To mages, every single warlock change happens in a vacuum, especially if it's a buff. All the nerfs are &quot;justified&quot; by the &quot;OPness&quot; or previous buffs of the Warlock class. Yet NONE of the buffs are justified by previous nerfs OR the reality of the situation?<br />
<br />
Blizzard should just disallow posting privileges for all Mages on the Beta and Normal forums. Maybe then we could get a balanced game without hearing 300 pages of QQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the case of simple decency, they should at least rotate the classes between expansions. As is shamans are the last to get the review for the third time in a row and end up with the most uninspiring changes, lacking any new tricks and toys the other classes get. &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
I'm at the point of deciding if I want to return to WoW or start with WAR... it's looking bleaker and bleaker for WoW. There's nothing attractive enough to make me jump in and I guess many other shamans feel similar.</div></div><hr />

You can always, you know, play a different fucking class if you hate it so much. It takes like 100 hours to hit 60, probably 120-150 to hit 70 once they nerf the exp required.<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't restrict your account to only shaman characters. If you find the class boring, REROLL.</div></div><hr />

Lol. Why to post at all if, first, you don't read and then post assumptions? <br />
<br />
First of all, why should I reroll anything, If I don't play anymore? I'm commenting from the point of view of a former player who reads these boards to see if there's anything for Shaman, that would make it worth returning to WoW for.<br />
<br />
I'd think I'd made it pretty clear in my OP.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phreeze</div><div class="date">2008-09-19, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">dought? Doubt you mean probably.<br />
<br />
There's ~ 150 mounts on wowhead, so it's quite close if you cut it in half. Should be possible certainly.<br />
<br />
<br />
oops yeah sry ^^ foreign language and it was late ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why in the world Blizzard would do this: &quot;*New Talent* Heroic Fury (Tier 9) - Removes any Immobilization effects and refreshes the cooldown of your Intercept ability. (45 Sec Cooldown)&quot; so far down in the fury tree leads me to believe that they want pvp fury warriors and they are not as interested in arms.<br />
<br />
Also, &quot;Titan's Grip now only reduces your chance to hit with damage-dealing abilities requiring a weapon. (Old - All melee abilities),&quot; makes me think they want to keep our white damage while mitigating our clickable skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So are Shamans boring or not? If Shaman is the only class you find interesting, why are you QQing about something that's interesting?<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Because you're only QQing about Shamans. And your only QQ is that they're weak. What are they weak/boring compared to? Other classes. HMMMM... maybe you should try some of those other classes then?<br />
<br />
You said it right there, the only class you care about are Shamans. Fucking retarded, why tie yourself to 1/10th of the game?</div></div><hr />
