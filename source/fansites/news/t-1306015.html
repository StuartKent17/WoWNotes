Battle.net Desktop Client<br />
The new Battle.net desktop client has been tested internally for some time now. It appears that testing is nearly here, as the Battle.net support site has been updated with related help articles (https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/uninstalling-battlenet-desktop-app).<br />
<br />
Currently only a Windows version has appeared for testing, but by the looks of the jobs page (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=130003H), a OS X version is in development as well. Unfortunately we are only able to see the offline mode for now, but there are a lot of features in the mockups.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind this is not an official preview, and many, many, many things will change before release.<br />
<br />
<br />
This replaces the launcher for all Blizzard games, and works similar to the current launchers, with background updates, repair tool, and more.<br />
Chat with Battle.net friends across every Battle.net enabled game.<br />

This is for all Blizzard products and not solely associated to WoW, so I highly doubt that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope it's not I like this idea hope you can do Battle.Net chat without going inside one of the games.... But this things does not really do anything for WoW as a game!<br />
It's more cross marketing thing!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">subanark</div><div class="date">2013-06-04, 05:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Odd... they have strings for all the wow xpacs, but only 1 D3 xpac and 1 SC2. Maybe they are just testing possible incompatibility in the future, and will add more latter on?<br />
<br />
And, no, I think we were given a hint that the unannounced feature has to do with inventory space (and not doing lower level content at lower level as they said they don't have a plan yet for how challenge modes will work past level 90).</div></div><hr />

Yes because this clearly provides a lot of new content for World of Warcraft, and totally relates to the previous expansions (Direct quote from the devs about what the 5.4 feature will contain).<br />

<br />
No, it's true, one of the few facts we have from the Blizzard team about the unannounced feature is that it will in someway provide content and have &quot;something&quot; to do with old content... but that it also isn't really a big deal.<br />
<br />
Not that that gives us much of an idea what it IS, just what it probably ISN'T.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kind of different though. Blizzards games have always been connected through the Battle.Net service and all this does is make it so you have 1 central area for all your games. EA tried to shove every game they publish through Origin when their games had zero reason to ever have such a service. Probably why it doesn't bother anyone to see things just being made simpler for Blizzard games.</div></div><hr />

In Brazil, Starcraft 2 was first sold as a subscription based game, which made the game much cheaper for brazilian costumers, which are used to paying extremely high prices for games (something that thankfully has been changing in the last few years). The game came with a 6-month subscription on the box and the option to make a &quot;lifetime&quot; upgrade for the same price you bought the game in the first place (which was around $20, which makes the total $40)<br />
<br />
Also as a bit of trivia, WoW's subscription in Brazil is also half the price ($7,50 vs $15) or even cheaper if you own a particular ISP (you get the battle chest for free and the subscription is lowered to $6)</div></div><hr />

Starcraft players could care less about WoW and Diablo players and WoW players do not care about Starcraft. So who except unemployed people with way too much time need a unified surface for all Blizzard games? My guess is, that in the future we will have to play a &quot;Blizzard sub&quot; to play all the Blizzard games. That way they can add new games without loosing sub money. If they for example release Titan 2016 many would quit their WoW sub to play Titan. But if you have a Blizzard sub, you can play both and continue to pay your sub...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, internally Blizzard always refer to their expansions by product initials + X + expansion number.<br />
<br />
S2X1 is the first expansion for Starcraft II.<br />
<br />
D3X1 is the first expansion for Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
WOWX1 = TBC<br />
WOWX2 = WotLK<br />
WOWX3 = Cataclysm<br />
WOWX4 = MoP<br />
WOWX5 = Whatever they're announcing at BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
They probably incremented to 9 because it's not much effort to do so. It does not mean anything regarding the number of planned expansions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No you have to think twice before you write what you think. It's Single Sign-On (SSO). Once logged into the launcher you just click 'Play WoW' or 'Play SC2' and you are in the game without logging into the specific game itself no more.</div></div><hr />

Why does it say in one of those Mockup pictures about the Desktop Battle.net &quot;Add Game Time&quot; for Starcraft II?...<br />
Mockup or not, Starcraft II Should still be a F2P Game<br />
I believe they are going to allow WoW services to be paid for using game time under some of the new unifying framework and the Starcraft name change service or any new ones is phrased along the same lines. Basically poor wording.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they are just testing possible incompatibility in the future, and will add more latter on?<br />
<br />
And, no, I think we were given a hint that the unannounced feature has to do with inventory space (and not doing lower level content at lower level as they said they don't have a plan yet for how challenge modes will work past level 90).<br />
<br />
No, they said they have plans for inventory space that they are not ready to announce yet.<br />
Specifically stated in interviews/discussions about the &quot;feature&quot; is that it has to do with old content.<br />
User generated content, scaling of players down or content up, queuing system for old content are popular ideas.<br />
<br />
I think the idea is to encourage account access via this client rather than following links from some random email to help reduce phishing / scams.<br />
As long as they can make it secure enough such that it is limited only to blizzard websites, then I think that is a good step forward.<br />
<br />
<br />
This seems like the perfect place to implement a proper voice service so we no longer need teamspeak/mumble/vent. It exists outside of the game, so if the game crashes, you dont lose voice.<br />
<br />
Blizzard are not sure they can compete with already existing, and far more flexible solutions.<br />
Everyone has different ideas as to what such a tool should do, and none of the current ones caters to everyone and nor could they.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, there will be a very awesome chat client where you can see everybody on your friends list before you even step into the game, and can even chat with them without logging into the game. The chat is currently disabled. They want to make sure the chat works correctly, and don't want to launch a client to everybody where the chat is broken, so it's being revamped.<br />
<br />
Right now the app takes 77 mb minimized, 82 mb when open. Meanwhile Steam is at 125 mb and climbing while open. The client loads up every time you load your computer without signing in, which is convenient.<br />
<br />
edit: resources may differ from computer to computer<br />
<br />
If you are complaining about another client to run, you are most likely just finding an excuse to complain about anything now-a-days. The bnet app is amazing, you just don't know it yet. Every plus side of this application outweighs any negative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This way you log onto one program and it runs steam, battlenet, origin, raptr, and every other 3rd party gaming interface ever made. It also will gradually suck the essence of your soul into its databank and erase your identity.<br />
------------------------<br />
With that little bit out of the way, positives:<br />
<br />
-Clears up my desktop a bit<br />
-Hopefully puts all account services and purchases on the app so I can go to one place for everything I ever need to do, whether it's renew a sub, buy a game, change a race, and order physical merch.<br />
-not needing to log on to each game individually with the same info/authenticator.<br />
-looks flashy<br />

Based on everything we see here, this isn't really intended as a Steam copy but more just a small app that lets you communicate across Blizzard games without being logged into them. I know I've always wanted to chat with my guild without being online.<br />
<br />
You can already do this ingame and on mobile.</div></div><hr />

I have an EU account but i'm playing on RU servers mostly now.<br />
I know that people with RU accounts can't play on EU servers, i really hope they won't block it the other way around... :P</div></div><hr />

It's Single Sign-On (SSO). Once logged into the launcher you just click 'Play WoW' or 'Play SC2' and you are in the game without logging into the specific game itself no more.<br />
<br />
I'll believe that when I perform that action and see it for myself, heard that lie many times before on things such as this.</div></div><hr />

I suppose it may be a lot like Origin as well. Do I like it completely though? Im iffy about that, I will have to wait and see. I would wonder if this is the big feature that blizz was talking about but they where talking about wow, not all of their games.</div></div><hr />

Nope, when you launch WoW through the client it skips the login screen and logs you in automatically.</div></div><hr />

Probably we don't have to wait too long before an actual release date is announced. Great work, Blizzard! I am more than pleased. =)<br />

What is the point in this? Why create a launch client for 3 games. Did Origin not show enough that it's shit?<br />
<br />
That's not even getting close to why Origin is a terrible, terrible launch client.</div></div><hr />

<br />
oh my glob guys this thing is totally similar to that other thing!<br />
alternatively: 20% cooler? (note: may be inaccurate)<br />
<br />
see also: way cleaner/sleeker than steam, also only plays blizzard games. it's only similar in functionality.</div></div><hr />

Few years down the road, every publisher will have it's own Steam alike app and my computer will be running 50 of those in the background or what. <br />
<br />
Not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: also since when does StarCraft 2 subscription based and requires game time to be added?<br />
<br />
Mockups are meant to give an initial impression of features or layout.<br />
Their content is often placeholder and not meant to be accurate.<br />
It is entirely possible that they meant to do WoW game time and someone did it wrong, or they simply did not care about getting that accurate.<br />
<br />
At present you can skip the launcher and only run it when you need to do updates.<br />
It is a reasonable assumption you can continue to do that.<br />
<br />
No new launcher yet has removed this option, so why the instant assumption that you HAVE to go through this one to reach the game.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things Steam does right, so really is trying to take some of those on a bad thing ?<br />
Also I think the typical style of the World of Warcraft interface is outdated, and would benefit from a modern touch.<br />
The likes of the MiirGui @ wowinterface (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info20292-MiirGuiTexturePack-Blue.html) graphics replacements shows what I mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG finally offline mode??? &quot;You cannot send messages while you are appearing offline.&quot; Yes please.<br />
<br />
I think that only applies to the chat functionality and not actually in-game, though that has been discussed in the past and is not out of the question as far as I am aware.</div></div><hr />

No seriously, with steam often using 100+ MB and origin around 80, this might become fun in the future.</div></div><hr />

Because RAM is so expensive and you only have 1gb right?</div></div><hr />

Yes, it does. It says WOW. They're most likely planning ahead of time so the code works correctly. Yeah few days late but better late then never :-P</div></div><hr />
