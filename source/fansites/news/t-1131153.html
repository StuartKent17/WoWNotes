&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;.wow-item-q7 {color:#E5CC80!important; }&lt;/style&gt;Mists of Pandaria Beta - Build 15689<br />
Two patches in a week is not enough, so how about a third? If you are tired of taking part in PvP on certain maps, it looks like there is now a solution for you! ERR_PVP_BLACKLIST_CAP indicates that players will be able to blacklist maps when queuing for some type of PvP.<br />
<br />
Black Market Auction House<br />
The Black Market Auction House allows players to bid on special items that are normally obtained in some other way. For example, Mei Francis (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/32216) normally sells mounts in Dalaran, but in this case she is auctioning Ashes of Al'ar (http://www.wowdb.com/items/32458)! <br />
<br />
The items for auction vary by server, as other servers are able to bid on Reins of the Blazing Drake (http://www.wowdb.com/items/77067), Swift White Hawkstrider (http://www.wowdb.com/items/35513), or Riding Turtle (http://www.wowdb.com/items/23720).<br />

<br />
Please do elaborate. I see <br />
&quot;Deadly Calm New: You enter a battle trance, reducing the cost of your next 3 Heroic Strike or Cleave attacks by 10 Rage. Instant, 60 sec cooldown.<br />
<br />
Fury<br />
Bloodsurge now has a 20% proc rate, down from 30%.<br />
<br />
Arms<br />
Taste for Blood now each additional Overpower will hit for an additional 30% damage, up from 20%.&quot;<br />
Only nerf i see is a proc on bloodsurge. So one fury nerf, Not a warrior nerf, just a spec nerf. Then i see a arms buff, thats not a nerf, So that makes it even more invalid.<br />
Then deadly calm coming back, Also not a nerf, semi buff and helping prot wars.<br />
Where do these warriors nerf that i dont see? Except 10% on fury, which is yet again a SPEC</div></div><hr />

Wonder whats with those legendaries, &quot;last black dragon&quot;? sounds like that black dragon you saved is dead and you stole his powers or something...<br />
<br />
Well Wrathion, even in living state, IS the last black dragon alive. I, for one, hope that I will beat shit out of that guy. And if the legendary would happen to be warlock uber-dark weapon, it would be cherry on the top. Also... Am I mistaken, or will this be first opening raid tier with its legendary?

<br />
You've not gonna beat up Wrathion. The whole point of the rogue questline is to establish that he is uncorrupted. He's actually a really cool character, and from his current location in Pandaria (with the head of the Black Market) it would seem he's going to be a sort of self-serving, mercenary sort of character.<br />
<br />
To assemble the legendary weapon, you'll probably have to do something for him, and he'll give you his fire in return. He's a wheeling-dealing type. Scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, etc.<br />
<br />
That's just my guess, though. His introduction (all of revamped Badlands) and rise to power (rogue legendary questline) were too big and epic to off him so quickly--especially when Blizz is apparently gunning for Garrosh.<br />
<br />
In terms of what the weapon is, I'd be very surprised if it were a dps caster weapon--we just got that (Tarecgosa's) 2 tiers ago. I'd wager it will be a tanking item (maybe a legendary trinket?) or healer item, this time around.<br />
<br />
It could also be the way that you upgrade gear to the current tier. Would be nice if we could upgrade legendaries to the current tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
seems like the item Breath of the Black Prince is likely the way you upgrade your gear. They were talking about instead of having gear to spend your valor on you would instead be able to raise the item lvl of your current gear by 7. This is likely the item you will raise your tier 14 gear item lvl.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crazy23</div><div class="date">2012-05-12, 08:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quilen<br />
Eternal Guardian New: Returns the spirit to the body, restoring a dead target to life with 20% health and 20% mana. 20 yd range, 2 sec cast, 10 min cooldown.<br />
<br />
Surface Trot New: Allows the Hunter and the Water Strider to walk across water for 10 min. Any damage will cancel the effect. Unlimited range, Instant.<br />
<br />
So hunters get a battle rez, and we can walk on water.<br />
<br />
Oh and finally basilisks tameable. Nice patch for hunters eh? :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If &quot;the powers of the last black dragon&quot; were only to increase ilvl by 14, his powers would be very, very low. He is descendant of Deathwing, expect him to do more then rais ilvl from tier 14 to tier 15 values.<br />
<br />
Also, I do not believe myself that there will be &quot;Tarecgosa 2.0&quot;, I am not part of high-end guild so I wouldnt be getting it anyway.<br />
<br />
Tanking legendary seems not legit, since it would be only warrior/pala or DK only or Druid/monk (I believe blizz also stated this with statement that legendary will not be another Quel'Delar where you chose its form.) Also, it wont be shield for same reason.<br />
I will eagerly expect some announcement.</div></div><hr />

Slow down there, tryhard. Way to take what I said out of context. Assuming and implying things impossible from such a small amount of words.<br />
<br />
Bloodsurge got nerfed, and the Incite glyph is a nerf.<br />
<br />
I know it's your opinion, but the idea of adding more superfluous buttons to the warrior class is a nerf as far as I'm concerned. It's (deadly calm) just gonna get macroed with Battleshout and forgotten. If it's on the GCD, it will be just another tedious burden warriors have to endure.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this, as much as I would hate to see rare mounts up for bid, I can't say that it would stop me from buying say, a plagued or black proto or any of the other mounts that are no longer in game if they ever pop up on the black market.</div></div><hr />

I know for a fact Paladins can solo it, and I'm fairly sure that I've heard of Priests, Mages, and Druids doing so as well. And this is just at 85.<br />
<br />
By the time we get to the end of MoP, I'm willing to bet that Ashes will be just as common as the Blue Proto-Drake is now, especially if it does end up on the Black Market every now and then.<br />

people COMPLETELY missed the bidding portion of those screenies.. they assume its just a vendor that you can go buy unlimited amounts of some item. its a brand new style of AUCTION HOUSE. players dont get to set the prices.. the game will randomly put an item up for bid.. there is NO BUYOUT.. its completely up to being bid on.

<br />
I didn't but a friend of mine has, the chance of getting ashes from it is like 0.5% <br />
<br />
Edit: Im thinking reins of the raven lord and deathcharger among others http://www.wowhead.com/item=69903/satchel-of-exotic-mysteries#contains:50-2-15+1<br />
<br />
Raid only mounts aren't part of it so i got ashes mixed up with other mounts.<br />
<br />
Same thing though really the death charger drops in those bags and is 1.1% (According to wowhead) more rare than ashes <br />
<br />
Ashes - 1.9%<br />
Death Charger - 0.8%</div></div><hr />

Exactly. I got Ashes this week (kill #29, very lucky), and I love it, but there are probably already 20 or so on my backwater server and everyone will be able to farm him multiple times a week at 90 so I'm under no delusions of being a special snowflake.<br />

Most MMOs today seem to be going towards this option, allowing late adopting players the opportunity to pick up previously great items for costumes or vanity. If you retrieved Ashes or are sporting ZG mounts (I have both), good for you. I hope they give the option for all items including 1% mounts from previous content. Invincible, Mimi's Head, and all Cata mounts soon to revert to 1%. I have little interest in grinding old raids and would rather acquire through this method in a second.<br />
<br />
If they make these items rare sales, that is once per week, it hardly devalues it. On my old server there were probably 100+ special snowflakes running around with it. If 1 new person acquires it per week via gold, then that's great. Lots of us only play the game anymore simply for the auction house and to buy favors. I know I wasn't even considering buying MOP, this changes everything now. Someone like myself can have their fun in the game.<br />
<br />
I do hope they include all TCG items in this as well. Give equal opportunity access to everyone in the game and let the ultimate gold sink flow. No more dealing with untrustworthy and shady interweb thieves, just wait on the value to hit a reasonable amount for you and purchase something fun.<br />
<br />
And for special snowflakes, don't worry. These mounts won't be going for 20k or even 50k on medium to large servers at least. If offered once per week you're talking million gold bankrolls competing against one another. Take solace in the fact that people in the beginning will be a million gold lighter and that a million gold was just taken out of the game.</div></div><hr />

While the cost in gold may be slightly prohibitive, a lot of those guilds are also willing to sell for real money. I've also seen at least one guild that was GIVING away rag mounts for people who did things such as liking their facebook page and winning contests that they would set up.

I agree..

What's you point? You are comparing buying to farming. FARMING..it takes no skill to obtain Ashes..none whatsoever. You can farm it week on end knowing that it will drop eventually. That is called farming..takes about 20 minutes out of your week. If you want to consider that some sort of skill prize to make you special, you are crazy.</div></div><hr />

And if there was anything they could introduce to the game that would make me and my friends ever buy gold or bot it would be this. I think blizzard needs to tackle the botting issue before they every release something like this into the game. Buying or botting gold yields too much of a reward right now vs. the actual risk of getting caught.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My point is that while it may take no skill to farm up Ashes, it also takes no skill to grab up current level raid mounts these days (of course it took skill to get them when they were &quot;new&quot; i'm not arguing that) and in fact, with the heroic rag mount being 100% drop currently, its far EASIER to get that mount than it is to get Al'ar. and for the record, I'm all for the black market AH selling rare mounts, gives me a chance to snag a few i missed out on.</div></div><hr />

As most people have been saying, there are tons of people who already have it. It really isn't all that 'unique' anymore. But it is an awesome mount and the RNG factor, as with any rare mount drop, is frustrating. So I don't mind that this is something that will rarely pop up on this new form of AH. I think it's kinda an interesting gold sink for players with too much. And a lot of the people who make gold, put a lot of effort into it, so I wouldn't say they get it for 'less effort' than those who farm it for 10 minutes every week. *shrug*</div></div><hr />

I hope Ashes will be there, as well as other RNG mounts, including old ZG mounts. They are/were relatively easy to farm and result depends purely on luck. Black market is a great idea for those of us that weren't lucky with RNG mounts.<br />
<br />
TCG and promotional mounts would be nice too. People buy TCG mounts for gold anyway, this way they can't get scammed. Some players are not eligible for promotional mounts (not all countries are eligible), being able to get them on black market would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

As for 'rare' mounts like ashes being sold, I really don't care. I see like 30-40 people in org with it these days, it's nothing special. Bring on more gold sinks I say!<br />
<br />
Also, you'll be able to farm this mount up to 50 times a week provided you have chars which are a high enough level to solo it, and at a 2% drop chance, you're pretty much guarenteed to get it in one week.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. For a moment there I thought you could just buyout them for 20k and another would appear the next day. That made me a sad panda. But since you can't buyout, the price can easily reach 200k, if not more. At least I'd pay 200k any day for the ashes. A mount collector could pay 3x more for all I know. I just hope that there's all kinds of raid mounts for sale. One every few days so all the mounts will still stay rare and not everyone can afford them either.</div></div><hr />

Basic economics. This black market ah both creates incentive for having large sums of gold (demand) and it takes gold of the market, lowering the amount of gold available (supply). This is so brilliant for goldsellers that it doesn't just affect one side of the economy, it affects both. This has the potential to really increase the worth of gold (which during cata went down to depressing levels).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it takes no effort, why don't you do it? No effort sounds easy. You could get rid of your angst for the &quot;super rich&quot; since you'll be one of them and it won't take any effort at all. Right?</div></div><hr />

While I like the idea of placing hard to get things on a special AH, I agree with this. It only rewards people who play the AH and have multiple toons at gold cap. This system can be abused far to easily too by people who are more bent out of shape being a special snowflake and would keep out bidding just to prevent anyone else from actually having it.</div></div><hr />

I doubt that, imagine a lot of 85's each bidding 20000+ and watching that grow, say around 1000000 gold for ashes by the time it gets sold (might be a little exaggeration but there's no way it would stay at 20) So far i think this is the best gold sink blizz can do.<br />

I like the idea of gold sinks.. but man.. they have been doing so good at making gold-sellers really worthless since there aren´t many things to buy with gold currently.</div></div><hr />

Every month an NPC would auction a unique pet with a 7 day bit and no buyout. Each month would have a unique pet.<br />

<br />
So provided the auctions dont happen too frequently as a safeguard to keep the demand for the items and thus the price high, can you really be bothered if someone wants to pay 500+ euro for a mount which rides just as fast as any other mount ? All you can do is just let him have his fun. Believe me these kind of people are rare, but you cant prevent them from doing it anyway , so why get mad about it ?<br />

That said, keep in mind that gold sellers are always having a lot of trouble at the start of expansions because blizzard usually hits them HARD around that time.</div></div><hr />

Technically you don't buy it, you bid on it. There can only be one winner for any one auction and we don't know how often it would be. There might only be one mount a month, there might be a 5% chance for any one mount to appear on the BMAH in a given week, we don't know.<br />
<br />
You won't suddenly see everyone riding it though. Hell, farming the raid is probably going to be easier than winning the auction. At least on the off-chance it drops in a raid you are soloing, you are the only one who can get it. On the quite possibly rare occassion it shows up on the BMAH, you have to compete against every Horde and Alliance character on your server who wants to have that mount, plenty of which could have several times the amount of gold you have.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a fantastic idea. One, it gives another, if just as difficult, avenue to get rare mounts and pets. Two, it helps reduce the amount of gold on a server. If mounts and pets are sold for appropriately large sums by the time the auction is over, this could bring the server economy back to not-so-ridiculous levels. No more stacks of ore for 500g if the total gold in the server economy has been reduced by several million each month (depending on how quick people can make it back).</div></div><hr />

Hit the nail right on the head. <br />
<br />
For those QQing over the ability for someone to have paid gold on a rare auction to obtain their ashes... ask yourself: &quot;What is it really about the mount that I'd like to preserve?&quot; Is it the rarity? It's still going to be moderately rare (on my server I see them all the time already). Is it that someone can buy their accomplishment that you worked so hard for, going in hundreds of times before it dropped for you? Guess what: someone can go in right now and get it to drop on their first time with enough luck. It's an RNG drop, people. Quit acting like it's some sort of elitist and grand achievement.<br />
<br />
This isn't taking away anyone else's chance at the ashes. This is an excellent idea and will work wonders as a gold sink for those like myself with a couple million gold laying around across several guild banks and alts and no use for it.</div></div><hr />

Years of trying for it finally paid off for me. I will be mad if I don't get to be as unique as before. D:<br />
<br />
But at the same time, it depends on how fast the auctions refresh. If a new mount is only up every other day or even longer, I'm good, even if it does allow the Big Love Rocket. If it's every day or sooner, will be mad. &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

Well this is the thing, I see your point, but I also see the negative about it. I got quite a few rare mounts, and some are quite easy to get. Raven Lord for instance, grind the Sethekk Halls HC a few times, and you get it easily. So it doesn't really matter if someone buys it at the BM or grind it. But you can see gear that you can't obtain anymore, if this is the same for mounts, I might find it a bit crappy to be honest. I mean, I got the Zulian Tiger, which I still love alot. It would be quite crappy if it's on the BM. Or the archaeology bug, I grinded many hours and hours to get it, and if people would just be able to buy it.. I don't know. We'll have to see how this all turns out.</div></div><hr />

Ofc there are people swimming in gold from legit ways, but most aren't. So when u go try and get 1 or more of those rare items, someone that made several caps from dupped mounts, will just lol at u!<br />
Without those problems, then the AH would be a nice gold dump, but as things are, it's just a reward for people that sold dupped stuff for months!</div></div><hr />

nothing but luck since that shit has been piss-easy to farm ever since level 80.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ashes - 1.9%<br />
Death Charger - 0.8%<br />
<br />
You can &quot;farm&quot; ashes once a week. You can farm Deathcharger hundreds of times a day.<br />
<br />
Can't say I like the AH thing - the content will be easy enough to solo with the increased level cap, why not just leave it at that? This is just going to promote gold selling.<br />
<br />
And to everyone complaining about &quot;special snowflakes&quot;, why can't people have things you don't have? You're just as bad, if not worse. We have a word for it, Spite, and I'd much rather be a &quot;special snowflake&quot; than spiteful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But if someone still thinks you can impress people with &quot;rare&quot; mounts, I don't know what to say.</div></div><hr />

Maybe even low population factions, though less likely.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liliannan</div><div class="date">2012-05-13, 06:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it (the black auction market) is a good idea (in print). Let's see how it works when it's implemented and go from there. <br />
<br />
So there is one market per server, right? Which means both horde and alliance can bid. I'm guessing your chance on actually winning one of these items will be very slim unless you have a lot of gold and are sitting at the auction house hour upon hour of the day to keep tabs of your bids. Most people are more likely to get these rare mounts by farming them than waiting on one to pop up every 3-4 months (or however much they plan on placing them on the auction house).</div></div><hr />

The only people who will win any auctions will be the ones who buy gold, the same ones who buy trading card mounts for 300-500k currently.</div></div><hr />

This is something I was hoping myself, winning!</div></div><hr />

God forbid people earn their gear.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, gold farmers are cheering at all the increased business they'll be getting.</div></div><hr />
