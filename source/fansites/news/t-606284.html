Update 13:45 CEST - New Bard Hero class announced and World of Warcraft coming to consoles with 'Molten Core' !<br />
<br />
New Bard Hero class announced<br />
The deeds of every great hero inspire countless songs of triumph, virtue, and epic adventure. But although a hero’s glory endures in song, the creators of those songs are seldom remembered. After ages spent singing of the heroic exploits of others, the bards of Azeroth are finally stepping into the spotlight on their own terms, proving once and for all that while just about anyone can pick up a sword or cast a spell, only a true hero can vanquish evil with the power of ROCK! Check out this new class here (http://www.wow-europe.com/wrath/features/bard/bardclass.xml?locale=en_GB)!<br />

We've got a lot of blue posts today, hope you've got some time to read everything. Don't forget that we're April 1st and we all know what it means ... You can get free gems from the Consortium !!!!<br />

/Random algorythm hacked - High roll addon released<br />
A few days ago, someone managed to decode the algorythm behind /random calculations, it didn't take long to exploit it and release an addon to get very high /random 100 everytime : Highroller (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info8583-HighRoller.html#info). This AddOn uses an advanced algorithm to time your roll requests to the server in order to increase your average roll value.<br />
<br />
Note that the addon is rather large due to the advanced algorithm. It must take into account things such as Name, Race, Class, guild name, and position. I have done everything I can to make the addon as fast an efficient as possible (I use both Ace2 and Rock so that its twice as fast!)<br />
<br />
How to install<br />
1. Download (http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info8583-HighRoller.html#info) and extract the mod in your usual &quot;World of Warcraft/Interface/Addons/&quot; directory.<br />
2. Enter the game and calibrate the mod by doing the following :<br />
- /random 100 (5 times)<br />
- /random 200 (5 times)<br />
- /random 1000 (10 times)<br />
3. This should be enough to detect everything needed on the server, if your average /random 100 value is below 96 just do a few more /random 1000.<br />
<br />

2008 WoW Arena Tournament Has Begun<br />
The 2008 World of Warcraft Arena Tournament has now officially begun. Players from around the world can compete on our special tournament realms using the new tournament format. We have leveled the playing field by allowing participants to choose and customize their character and equipment and team up with fellow players to clash in 3-vs.-3 Arena battles. For more information on the tournament, including how to register and participate, please visit our Arena Tournament information page. Good luck and good fight!<br />
<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/index.xml (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/pvp/tournament/index.xml)<br />
http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/arena/tournament/index.xml (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/arena/tournament/index.xml)<br />
However, players live tournament realms are experiencing a few problems with the lag and bugs, the practice window will probably be extended for a few days because of that.<br />
We are aware of the lag issues, including vendor, item purchase, zoneing lag, and spinning up arena matches, and are working with our operations team to find out what is causing the problem. Something with the live environment is causing the issues - something we didn't see on the Tournament Test Realm.<br />
<br />
Yes. We will most likely extend the practice window for a few days, at least.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tournament registration restrictions<br />
There is no ETA for the end of registrations to the Arena Tournament, Thundgot also explain why it's not possible to let all the countries participate in the event. <br />
Tournament registration is not closed. We do not currently have a time at which it will be closed.<br />
<br />
We do understand and share the frustration some express about not being able to participate, but unfortunately there are laws and regulations that prevent us from including all countries in contests and this kind of tournaments. The restrictions vary based on the exact contests and tournaments (luck factor and prize value being two key points), and while we try to adapt most contests and tournaments to include as many as possible, spanning all - or even most - European countries with these events is very tricky.<br />
<br />
At the same time we do wish to have these events in Europe, and also not make them a significantly &quot;lighter&quot; version of those in other regions. We see this as &quot;include as many as possible&quot;, not an &quot;everybody or nobody&quot; scenario, and continually work to include as many countries as possible in each event.<br />
<br />

WotLK - Changes to XP required to level<br />
Drysc commented the change we posted here yesterday concerning changes to XP required to level at level 70 in the latest patch. (See this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=5833.0))<br />
Possibly, we haven't announced or even decided on anything final whatsoever, but it really doesn't matter how much the XP curve is increased. The important factor is how much XP you'll be getting from the quests and kills.<br />
<br />
You can make the bucket 10x bigger, but if the water filling up the bucket increases comparably then it's really no different. What that does though is makes older water sources less desirable to fill your bucket from.<br />
<br />
<br />
Doom Lord Kazzak in 2.4<br />
Having Kazzak next to Daily Quest spots is annoying, but there isn't any plan to move him.<br />
There are currently no plans to move him. If you stay to the western side there isn't much of a chance of him getting to you, or you can gather up some friends and remove him from the area for a few days. <br />
<br />
<br />
Reasons behind the changes to weapons sizes<br />
Drysc explains why the size of sheated weapons got changed on a few races, especially taurens.<br />
&quot;There were changes made to the Tauren weapons, while sheathed, to address issues where weapons would clip through the ground or the player model itself. The item size is reduced while sheathed so that they aren't dragging through the ground, etc.<br />
<br />
My own personal opinion is also so that the weapons in Lich King can be longer and/or more complex, but I wouldn't take that as an official reason.<br />
<br />
There is an issue though where the main hand will appear smaller than the off-hand while sheathed, which I would guess probably isn't intended. We're of course very aware that the visual representation of a player's character is extremely important, and we attempt to make changes to it as infrequently as possible.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;As the change was made to fulfill an artistic desire to reduce the amount of clipping the weapons exhibited while sheathed we have no plans to revert the change at this time.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Impacts of addons on raid difficulty<br />
Drysc made a long post about the use of addon in raids, he explains that when raid encounters are designed, Blizzard try to keep in mind that people will be able to make them &quot;easier&quot; by using timers, boss mods, etc ... and adjust the difficulty accordingly. <br />
No, I think we assume that those who are working on the extreme endgame PvE content are going to be doing anything they can in order to help increase their chances for success. By both embracing the UI mod community and their addons, as well as assuming that players are going to be using them to great effect versus our encounters, we have to design encounters that assume their use or the encounter is trivialized by those on vent, those with a countdown, those with a threat meter, etc. Once a lot of the guess work is removed with mods we have to raise the complexity beyond what a mod can purely assist with. I think at this point we're forced to assume everyone is using mods to great effect versus our design complexity, which in turn forces everyone to use those mods. It's probably somewhat debatable what mods are required and where, but it's certain that we have to take them into account, lest the game be trivialized.<br />
<br />
UI Mods have become an integral part of the game for many players, and we've been extremely pleased with the amount of customization and information they're able to provide. We're continually working to assess and implement new UI features, many of which have come straight from the community, to help ensure that the default UI is as full featured as possible while remaining uncluttered, clean, attractive, and easily approached.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunter - Growl changes in 2.4<br />
Hortus posted a very long post about changes made to growl in 2.4.<br />
First let me say that Growl and Charge interaction is not the same as it was in 2.3.3, this is being looked at separately by the developers. I'm specifically looking at the reports that other pets are not not holding aggro as well in 2.4 as they did in 2.3.3.<br />
<br />
Second let me remind you all that threat meter add-ons are not an accurate tool for testing threat. We have internal tools that can display exact threat numbers but those functions are not available to mods in any way.<br />
<br />
Third Growl does not appear in the combat log on the &quot;self&quot; filter by default. You must turn it on by selecting Spell Casting message types in the settings for that filter. You can always see Growl in the combat log if you use the &quot;everything&quot; filter.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
I have been able to verify by side by side comparison that Growl auto-casts consistently when turned on and that it is doing the exact same amount of threat in 2.4 as it did in 2.3.3.<br />
<br />
I also did side by side testing of two identically geared and talented hunters (using a copy of a retail character that reported this problem) with identical fully skilled pets and compared threat.<br />
<br />
I sent the pets to attack an unkillable target.<br />
After the opening growl I turned on Auto-shot, and hit Arcane Shot.<br />
I then chain cast arcane shot 9 more times as soon as it was off cooldown.<br />
I then compared the threat of the pet and the hunter. Both were within 10% of each other.<br />
<br />
I repeated this on 2.3.3 and 2.4 and the results were nearly identical.<br />
<br />
I also repeated this test using Improved Hunters Mark (as I notice all the hunters reporting it have that talent) and the threat for both the pet and the hunter were higher but still within acceptable margins and aggro was not lost by the pet by the 10th arcane shot on 2.3.3 or 2.4.<br />
<br />
There may be a bug with hunter pet aggro, but it is not caused by Growl. If anyone has more information or observations about threat they can post here and I'll try to take a look at them.</div></div><hr />
