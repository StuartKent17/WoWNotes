All the people who went to the WWI have probably gotten an EU beta code and all the people who went to Blizzcon 07 have gotten a US beta key.<br />

Wrong<br />
<br />
You select a region when you register the WWI code with your email. You don't register the WWI key with a account, but simply an email. <br />
<br />
Then they send a new email to you (I posted it in another topic)</div></div><hr />

Seems I'm confusing it with the mini pet.<br />
<br />
You still get to select Country however, I did assume that would pick a region.<br />
Blizzard fails I guess.</div></div><hr />

Use http://thepiratebay.org/tor/4306654/WotLK-Beta-3.0.1-enGB , it's much faster than Blizzard's downloader.<br />
<br />
(I'm speedcapped at my connection, Chaosvex was downloading ALOT faster according to IRC)</div></div><hr />

Thank you for contacting Blizzard Entertainment regarding beta testing.<br />

We are still sending out beta invites for Wrath of the Lich King. At this time we do not have an eta on the completion of these invites as you will want to keep an eye on your email address. Please also keep in mind that not all players will receive beta invites as they are chosen at random.<br />

<br />
From what I see, and I have researched this, They are sending invites out every Sat/Sun/Mon/Tues/Wed. Most of it is sent on Monday's and Tuesday's.<br />
<br />
There is also an answer on the Customer Service forums, and if you entered your key sometime this past week, you should be in the running for the next wave of beta invites.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hey guys! Thanks for waiting.<br />
<br />
There's another wave of invites intended to go out quite soon (within the week or thereabouts) and it should catch the remaining Beta Club folks who didn't get their invites.<br />
<br />
If you do not receive your Beta Club invite mail in the next wave, follow up with me here and I'll do what I can.<br />

Because I'd be lying if I said it was tomorrow, hombre! It is not. It's safe to assume, given the Blizzcon beta key cutoff date of August 1, though, that it'll be after August 1st.<br />

I can see doing waves to slowly grow the population, and controlling it.<br />
<br />
It's good to see that Blizzcon and WWI, and Dell Laptops (who OVERpaid for that laptop mind you) guarantee a spot which i think we knew was the case but people on the wow forums planted the seed that it doesn't. <br />

but did you opt in? you have to opt-in in your acc management. you wont get the code if u havent done that, no matter whether u have been in wwi or not. <br />
<br />
anyway i saw some post yesterday that new batch of codes is gonna be sent this week. this will include both people from wwi who havent got their code yet and people who are supposed to get code thanks to buying dell laptop<br />

I'll be back to work next week working my normal hours from 8 AM - 9/10PM everyday, and am leaving for college orientation on Thursday, so go figure, the week the invites are probably being sent out I have no free time. <br />
<br />
The worst part is just the waiting and not knowing, it'll be probably make actually getting the key even more exciting, but it sucks now. I just wish the Blues would give us an update from the &quot;After Aug 1st deadline,&quot; key distribution speech they've been saying for some time now.</div></div><hr />

I was just thinking that, maintenance on Friday isn't a normal occurrence, so I'm hoping that means we'll get some beta invites because the realms will be down until after midnight - after the Blizzcon '07 / WWI '08 / Dell Laptop deadline. Lets cross our fingers for a surprise email tomorrow morning!</div></div><hr />

Since Blizz employees don't work weekends we won't get any updates this weekend, and maybe not even Monday due to how they're not just going to tell us the release, which I don't understand.</div></div><hr />

Just FYI, an invite wave was just sent out; I'm unsure as to who these went out to, don't know if it was BlizzCon or opt-ins or what, but there were some invites!<br />

This is probably unrelated to the Dell stuff but I'd still check your email in the next few hours just in case. :)<br />

Quote from blizz<br />
<br />
&quot;It appears that this latest wave included opt-ins. This doesn't mean it excluded other types, just that opt-ins were in it. <br />
<br />
I need to place an information-seeking priority on those who've already been guaranteed beta keys, and opt-ins, unfortunately, are not one of these groups. <br />
<br />
Questions on opt-in dates are not customer service issues and as such it's unlikely I'll respond to inquiries of this nature in the future. &quot;<br />

But back on topic, I was under the impression that there would be a wave that was specifically sent to Blizzcon, WWI, and Dell Laptop Beta Club members who registered before the Aug 1st deadline (and some who registered far before that), but still haven't gotten a key. It also seemed as though this wave was supposed to be before any other Opt-in wave. I'm just a bit confused because all of the information we have been given seems to have been falsified in the last few days. I do understand how the last wave of Blizzcon, WWI, and Dell Laptop (if any) came out on a Tuesday (even though beta realm maintenance is on the day of a new push and not Tuesday like live realms), so I am really hoping for Blizz to finally come through on their end of the deal, I will be relieved to stop constantly checking my email, customer service forums, and threads on MMO-Champion, even though I love this website.</div></div><hr />

I thought he made a comment on how they weren't going to wait for all the blizzcon things to come out and send another wave (which could have ment last night's wave was that opt in wave he mentioned at one point this past weekend) before the WWI/Blizzcon/Dell laptop ones. Hopefully this means that the next wave is the Blizzcon/WWI/Dell Laptop. With that said i know there is a bunch of people who registered there Blizzcon keys last year after the event and haven't got in yet... <br />
<br />
I know it sucks waiting but at least we're guaranteed a spot, at some point even if its 4 weeks before release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is simply an idea.* I'm bored (waiting for the call that I have the day off due to weather - landscaping ftw) and my mind is wandering, just coming up with reasons for this major disappointment.<br />
<br />
Another thought I just had is that the Blizzcon, WWI, and Dell Laptop Beta Club is a lottery all in itself, not so much as you might not get in, but that you are guaranteed a spot, HOWEVER, the invites MAY NOT all be at once, and may not be as soon as they've made it sound (a single wave picking up everyone guaranteed a spot), which means the keys could be sent from this day to a week before WotLK goes live.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">zado</div><div class="date">2008-08-05, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well by them giving us an aug 1st deadline to be included in this mysterious wave debunks what you said. That deadline tells us they want us all together to get in together. And the deadline itself gives us a ballpark estimate as to when we are goin to get invited. Which is of course around aug 1st we would think. Shrug, tonite will be interesting thats for sure.<br />

<br />
Yes, tonight will be interesting since the keys don't seem to be sent out during the day.* I heard in the first wave of Blizzcon / WWI people the emails were received around 7 PM EST (about the time Blizz HQ closes).* Last night I think they might have been received a little later.* We'll see though, but undoubtedly tonight will be interesting whether or not we get our precious invites.</div></div><hr />

Crepe - &quot;They're [Blues] the middle men in this situation. QA decides how many beta testers they need each wave, not the GM department.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is somewhat validating my statement earlier about the number of Blizzcon, WWI, and Dell Laptop members who need keys in relation to the current amount of content being tested. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of people that registered for a guaranteed spot in beta from Blizzcon, WWI, or Dell Laptop beta club, and honestly the phase the beta is in right now (I personally think) would not rectify inviting the large number of Blizzcon, WWI, and Dell Laptop beta club members. I don't think this is an excuse not to give us our invites ASAP (zomg today plz), but rather, should have been considered more before sending out Opt-ins.<br />
<br />
It seems as though people are getting more and more disgruntled with the current situation pertaining to Blizzcon, WWI, and Dell Laptop beta club members. I think if there's much more discontent in the customer service forums we will get an update. When everyone gets home from work and check their email to no avail, and then checks the customer service forums with no updates there will be another burst of anger.

I made a post in wow-europe (in the spanish section of WWI) because, we dont have Customer support forum<br />

I sent 2 mails, one to wowbetabilling@blizzard.com and another to wowbetabilling-eu@blizzard.com trying to explain the situation (no answer atm)<br />

<br />
I think Blizzard could make huge improvements to their customer service but actually changing their working pratices, on big issues like this that are obviously effecting a lot of people what harm would it do to make one post, pin it and then merge all other topics to it all they need to do is say<br />
<br />
&quot;thanks we know that not all of you have got them and we are looking into why. i am not going to post updates here on everything we find but will let you know once a solution has been reached&quot;<br />

&quot;still checking this&quot;<br />

I work as a systems analysts for a large uk retailer and this is like the number 1 rule of customer support. dont let you customer know why, how, when it was broken but let them know you know its broken...</div></div><hr />

So... Have you gone ape shit yet? cuz if so and you got your key ITS MY TURN!<br />
But back to the topic, i bets great to be european right now, NONE of my friends on wow have gotten their key yet and neither have I. I'm so sad right now and im gonna blow a fuse if i dont get into the beta at all because i have been on all of the patch test realms since 2.1!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you Aphelyon on the CS thread?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I went into account management, scrolled down to the bottom and clicked on &quot;Full Payment History.&quot;<br />
<br />
You can see when your account was billed from month to month, I was billed on May 14th, so my account went until July 14th and expired, and then reactivated on the 30th.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard's 1 month is 30 days... If it is 31 days... I would /skeet</div></div><hr />
