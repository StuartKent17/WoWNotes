It's time for another spotlight! This time I would like to point out a fairly new addon called AVR (Augmented Virutal Reality) (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/avr.aspx) and AVR Encounters (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/avr-encounters.aspx). This addon will let you draw markings on the 3D world anywhere and share it with anyone! This is incredibly useful for any raid leader, but it's not the only feature. <br />
<br />
Some of these drawings can be automatized and triggered by spells and NPCs, this is how you get AVR Encounters (http://www.wowace.com/addons/avr-encounters/)! This submod adds warnings and very noticeable visual helps for for various boss abilities. <br />
<br />
I know a lot of people will ask: this is JUST an addon and it doesn't use anything else than the Blizzard's API, you won't get banned for using that (but I cannot guarantee that Blizzard will not disable it at some point). For more information on the addon you can also check the following:<br />

<br />
Description<br />
AVR (Augmented Virtual Reality) allows you to draw and add lines, circles and other markings on the 3D world itself. All markings may also be shared with others. Suitable for example to mark locations when explaining raid tactics. These marks can even be left visible for the fight itself.<br />
<br />
Other things you can do with AVR:<br />
<br />
Draw range circles around you or someone else at any range<br />
Clearly mark players close to you<br />
Mark any location relative to player position and rotation, for example mage blink landing spot<br />
Measure distances<br />
Boss encounter warnings (using a separate addon) <br />
<br />
Boss encounters<br />
AVR does not contain a built in boss encounters module anymore. They are now done by a separate addon. At the moment there are two options.<br />
<br />
AVR Encounters (http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/avr-encounters.aspx) adds AVR warnings for various boss abilities. It does not require any other boss encounter addon to work. It is not a replacement for traditional boss encounter addons as it does not do ability timers, sound warnings etc. It can be used with any traditional boss encounter addon such as BigWigs, DBM or DXE.<br />
Raid Watch 2 (http://www.wowace.com/addons/rw2/) is a full boss encounter addon much like BigWigs, DBM or DXE. It has built-in support for AVR and also does timer bars and other kinds of warnings. <br />
<br />
Whichever you choose to use, you will also need to install AVR.<br />
<br />
Limitations and known issues<br />
There are some fundamental limitations caused by what information is available to addons. These are mostly related to the exact position of camera and lack of unit Z coordinates. In particular you should note following:<br />
<br />
Drawing works best on a flat surface (note that for example Dalaran has very uneven roads).<br />
Camera getting stuck in a wall or ceiling will cause any markings to go out of sync with rest of the world.<br />
Any kind of stairs/slopes and such cause troubles.<br />
Jumping and other kinds of vertical movement causes the drawings to move with you.<br />
Everything is drawn over the 3d world. This means that things that should be behind walls or units will appear in front of them.<br />
Camera auto follow causes some problems. <br />
<br />
Some other known issues are:<br />
<br />
All vehicles (like the ones at the start of Ulduar) are a bit problematic.<br />
Lifts, moving platforms and in particular Gunships in Icercown Citadel raid have some problems.<br />
Player map coordinates are unavailable in Icecrown Citadel raid on Lich King platform after the edges have collapsed. This means that any markings tied to zone coordinates or other players than yourself are unusable there. (Lana'Thel's room was fixed in 3.3.3 though the ramps leading there are still a bit odd.) <br />

Wild Growth cooldown change in Cataclysm<br />
This kind of thing comes up a lot, where players see us messing with cooldowns and assume it's a nerf instead of our trying to give them room to actually cast more spells.<br />
<br />
Raising the cooldown on spells like Wild Growth and Circle of Healing are good things for healers. It's one of the few* things that will buy you GCDs to actually cast other spells. With a 6 sec cooldown, you really only get to cast maybe 3-5 other spells before you need to hit that magic button again.<br />
<br />
Let me put it another way... if there was no cooldown on Wild Growth would you ever hit another button? The frequency with which druids use it today suggests the answer is: not often.<br />
<br />
* - an alternative is to make the mana cost so extreme that you're making a very bad decision any time you use Wild Growth or Circle and 5-6 targets aren't seriously injured. I'm not sure that would be any more fun though. You don't always have the precious seconds to analyze the situation and calculate how many players need instant healing. It's one thing to guess whether your fast or big heal is more appropriate on a target. It's a little trickier to do that for multiple targets at once.<br />
<br />
In before &quot;It wouldn't be overpowered if we didn't do raid damage&quot; and &quot;Well we come to expect nerfs when all of our overpowered spells get nerfed.&quot; :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401904223/there-goes-wild-growth/))<br />

Warrior tanking in Cataclysm<br />
I'll abstain from using actual quotes here, but these things were basically said above.<br />
<br />
Using Demo Shout to tank:<br />
<br />
-- We don't like the feel of this. It hits for no damage and puts a debuff on the target that isn't visible and doesn't change the target's behavior at all.<br />
<br />
Getting a new tanking AE to use when SW and TC are on cooldown:<br />
<br />
-- What's the point though? Why not just remove TC's cooldown rather than add yet another ability you're supposed to spam in rotation?<br />
<br />
On warriors losing Cleave:<br />
<br />
-- You're not losing Cleave. You don't have infinite use of it, but you're not going to have infinite use of any of your abilities, because things will cost rage and if you spend rage unwisely you're going to starve yourself. Use Heroic Strike vs. single targets and Cleave against groups. Besides, I hardly see how Cleave is this panacea for the staggered adds scenario seeing as how it hits a grand total of one additional target (two if glyphed).<br />
<br />
On tab targeting:<br />
<br />
-- We really don't want to see a scenario (for any tank) where you just stop using your single-target abilities completely. It's fine to supplement those with an AE attack, but not completely ignore them in group situations. (As an aside, the paladin doesn't really do this now because he uses the same rotation for both singles and groups. The druid doesn't do this now because Lacerate doesn't hit hard enough relative to Swipe. Both are easily fixable though.)<br />
<br />
[...] Let's take four scenarios that cover the majority of encounters:<br />
<br />
1) If dozens of twilight whelps are streaming in, fine, just AE tank them and have the dps use Blizzard, Hurricane, Whirlwind, etc. I think you all know how to this by now. :)<br />
<br />
2) If you're doing a four pull and the mobs hit really hard, then CC one or two and dps the others down single target. You'll want to keep threat on all the loose mobs, but not by spamming an AE ability unless you can buy yourself plenty of room. I know everyone is scared of CC, but we actually made a pretty good spread of CC abilities in LK, and then sadly nobody ever got to use them. In Cataclysm we are making sure to spread abilities around even more.<br />
<br />
3) Now, if you're doing a four pull and you think you can get away without CC, then ideally you'd use your AE attacks but still pick a target to focus on. That's the one that gets your Shield Slams and Heroic Strikes and that's the one dps should focus on first. Keep in mind in today's world the warriors are Whirlwinding and the Rets are Divine Storming even the single targets, which generates threat on the off targets, which means you might lose those targets if you aren't tabbing among a bunch of them. In Cataclysm, everyone should be able to focus on one mob at a time again.<br />
<br />
4) On the single target fight, like many bosses, you'd just use Thunder Clap for the debuff and otherwise keep up your single target rotation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401521630/twitter-chat-on-warrior-aoe-tanking/))<br />

I hate to be negative but I have a good feeling blizzard isn't going to like this mod. :-[<br />

Maybe they will allow a toned-down version of this eh?</div></div><hr />

With a bit of luck, i think you may have just sealed that fate. There's a blue post out there (that I'm to lazy to find) that said they don't have a problem with the addon, for now. but if too many people started using it they might go and disable it.<br />

I totally agree, AVR on front of MMO-Champion is like... free porn on Youtube's homepage.<br />
<br />
I see two scenarios now : <br />
- Blizzard ban/disable this addon in any way they can<br />
- It becomes mandatory for the next years for every single PVE oriented guild, the final evolution of bossmods.<br />
<br />
Edit : Just to evaluate the audience of your site, roughly 5k total downloads before the news.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its cool to let raid leaders show things on screen, but leave it as a strategizing tool, not the new DBM.<br />
<br />
i have an idea, if you use this mod you can no longer QQ when you die cuz you suck. this is the only positive i can think or coming form this mod.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit: Oh and it's only a matter of time till there's a config for this addon that shows each raid member where he should be at any given moment of the encounter. I can pretty much already see colored circles floating around the encounter room and people following them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would certainly hope that in the event this doesn't cause any problems with blizzard's ToS, that this never becomes a requirement in raiding, and if it does, i'm going to lie about it and still be raiding on my merry way.<br />
<br />
Actually knowing how the boss works (especially after defeating it more than once), or reflexes should be all that's required.<br />
<br />
EDIT:And if anyone complains, mods that would benefit healers and tanks are an exception. Certainly easier downloading a mod that shows portraits of healing targets rather than dragging every frame onto your screen from the raid menu.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure Blizzard could disable addons if they wanted to, encouraging people to contribute to making the game better through their own programming is in the end beneficial to everyone, including Blizz themselves who can make use of some addons/coding and see potential faults.<br />

This mod is something smart people will use to trivialize fights. Gearscore is something idiots use to drag themselves down even further. Big difference, and hence why one might get banned while the other won't.</div></div><hr />

Because some of us like to go on the forums, and I can 100% say there will be people who use this addon who will go on the forums and endlessly bitch about how easy WoW has become.

For Raidleaders its a dream to just draw your tactics on the ground and be done with it. The rest with showing boss skills is just the next level of bossmods.

Screw the addon btw, I can make you a green and a red flare if you need colors to follow. I don't want my WoW to be paint circles all over.

Gearscore is the worst and needs to go. AVR and AVR-E are fine. I am positive that guilds/raids using this addon will still have players that fail, just because they truly do fail. Sure the addon draws for you, but you still have to move with your mouse and/or keyboard to move and stuff. There will be idiots still. This addon will make that obvious.</div></div><hr />

plugins are coming out, like the one showing you minimap pings in real world. the idea is good, learning encounters is good, and it's not so much easier to kill bosses with that installed. it just shows you where to go, and where to stand not. you still have to move, avr doesnt move your toon.</div></div><hr />

/sarcasm<br />
<br />
and 'inB4' &quot;cuz Blizzard UI is pro&quot;:<br />
Blizzard never having taken the time to develop a sensical UI should have no baring on someone's ability to move out of the giant black void zone / pretty red fire / path of the blindingly bright lightning missile / growing neon green slime puddle or upon someone's ability to notice that they are standing smack the f* on top of another player in a fight with splash damage (cuz if you don't see it, it's very unlikely that any amount of flashing lights, bells or whistles will help you).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sad, but true. <br />
<br />
I do question this mod.... the big thing for me has always been whether an addon would give you access to information you wouldn't otherwise have, or allowed you to do things you could not do without the addon. Most addons I use change the accessibility of the information or the way you input commands.... this does seem to be a bit more. Knowing that the boss is using an attack is one thing (you can get that with cast bars or the in-game warning), but having a graphical representation of exactly where that attack is going to end is quite another. <br />
<br />
My other big concern is that everyone in the raid needs to be using the addon for it to work properly as a raid warning style system. Some raid groups like to require DBM, but DBM doesn't give you that much more than the default does, and it's pretty low memory usage anyways. AVR is neither of these things.... how long before self-important pug leaders begin requiring people to have this addon to join the group?</div></div><hr />

This kind of thing comes up a lot, where players see us messing with cooldowns and assume it's a nerf instead of our trying to give them room to actually cast more spells.<br />
<br />
Raising the cooldown on spells like Wild Growth and Circle of Healing are good things for healers. It's one of the few* things that will buy you GCDs to actually cast other spells. With a 6 sec cooldown, you really only get to cast maybe 3-5 other spells before you need to hit that magic button again.<br />
<br />
Let me put it another way... if there was no cooldown on Wild Growth would you ever hit another button? The frequency with which druids use it today suggests the answer is: not often.<br />

even now with DXE or DBM u must be a complete retard to fail on things besides defile cause defile is a short notice ... so on defile to fail u just have slow reflexes... and DXE , DBM doesen't take away the fun cause it just shows cooldowns and on who the abilities are<br />
Anw.... showing exactly where to stand makes things just too easy....<br />

<br />
Thank you john, what a nice addon it is indeed! I've just been testing it out and I have to tell you, it only has three major flaws:<br />
<br />
1: Memory usage, 6 mb addon memory is not quite little<br />
2: It moves up and down as you move up and down, but as most fights are on a pretty level terain that won't bother you as long as you keep your profiles properly maintained to not see every fight in the raid all the time.<br />
3: Biggest flaw, it cannot account for your camera being forcefully moved closer by objects, therefore if you have max camera distance (which you should! with the macro! get it!) you might see your drawings become smaller than intended because your camera distance got forcefully pushed down.<br />
<br />
The author knows all of this, and it's not fixable, so the addon isn't going to get any sweeter than it is now.<br />
<br />
As for the question &quot;Is this cheating?&quot;, Personally I think that at least AVR is nót cheating, it's simply a better and more efficient and insighfull way of doing things we could already do by jumping around with a mark above our head, telling people where to stand. And ofcourse the blizzard implemented method of smoke flares does pretty much the same but it's not as good.<br />
<br />
AVREnc however is a slighly different story, I still do not concider this cheating personally, it's no different than any radius monitor already built in to most boss timer addons. We'll see what blizzard has to say however.<br />
<br />
All in all, I like this idea, I've thought of a simmilar idea about three years ago but I don't know how to make addons, especially not as good as this one. I think that, if this stays, it will become as &quot;mandatory&quot; as bosstimers and decursive are now, and here's the sunny part of that: blizzard knows that we all use those addons, and since we do they can make fights a lot harder. For example, if wow didn't have interface addons then dispelling would be a lot less needed on most fights, the same can be said about all the other things you can do with those addons, and in the future maybe even for AVR (imagine for example grobbulus casting his infection twice as much, just because blizzard knows we all use AVR).<br />
<br />
The addon is brilliant, I've done some testing with the placement of drawings, and they don't move a single inch if you place them right and don't encounter flaw 2 or 3.<br />
<br />
Back to you, john.</div></div><hr />

Ok so tomtom and moveitmoveit then? and obviously I'm not the only one since your taking a stand against this addon and supporting other addons that in theory do the same thing.

Aye, unless you're running the game with a gig or less of ram then it doesn't matter how much ram the add on is using. The more important thing is how many CPU cycles the add on is using -- that is what hurts your frame rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
All it does is put an image over-top of your own view of the world, just like your player frame, it does not add anything to the game world itself. It only looks like it is in the game world because it is transparent, and the author is frakking amazing at math. But people really have to start thinking of this addon for what it is, it is completely 2D images, no different than the images in your cast bar or recount frame. The 2D images are simply shaped in such a way that they create an illusion of a 3D graphic. And the only way you will ever see these images is if you yourself download this addon. So I'm really not sure what people's problems are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would suggest you spending more then 1 minute to think before being shocked. For example, this addon can tell you where the safespots are from the goo falling down on the raid, during fester or rotface (Can never remember who is who). Can DBM tell you where the goo will land, except then right ontop of you? NO. There you go, the difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The difference is that AVR-E takes a &quot;snapshot&quot; of everyone's position right when it explodes and keeps it fixed in form of those circles. If you were paying attention to everyone's position right as it explodes you would know where it's safe to stand.<br />
<br />
The outrage over this is a bit silly in my opinion, considering every feature can be found in DBM and similar bossmods. Most of it has the same functionality as a range checker or the &quot;SHADOW CRASH ON ME!&quot; yells. It just gives you that information in a smarter way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is thou, in the scenario without AVR-E you would have to use your brain instead of an addon showing you where safespots are.. I dont think anyone can memorise every single position of 24 other people, resulting in often standing in other's spot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, this is the only thing I consider borderline broken with it. Instead of running 20 yards out of bad stuff, you know you can stand still after 7 1/3 yard. I find it a bit amusing that people claim that only bad players have advantage from this, since a good player can use this to really maximize dps/healing output.<br />

The mod itself is brilliant. As a programming exercise I have to admire the addon and its author(s). I have to absolutely despise it though for what it's gonna do to raiding if it doesn't get banned. <br />

Not gonna happen until blizz fixes the default UI to be usable for things like healing raids. 5 years and counting now...<br />

Hypocrisy is strong in this one, and similar comments. Right now if you watch average boss kill videos from youtube over half of the screen is covered by various addons. Nothing really changed in that respect about seeing or not seeing the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This will screw up the hard part of pve. (if there is any now) <br />
<br />
Cata would make pve more troublesome... How is this gonna help. <br />
Please the meaning of pve is to be a group and try out things. <br />
In this way your are just a machine. <br />
<br />
please blizz ban helping addons and destroy this one... <br />
<br />
Of course people like this... but those are just the Super mario players. <br />
you guys are begging for the addon that your character attacks and moves on it own. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My problem with AVR-E is simple. It dumbs almost any encounter down to just &quot;move where red/greed/purple circle is pointing you&quot;. If you think pugs are bad now, just wait what this mod does in couple of weeks. People won't be forced to know anything about encounter. They won't know what bosses do, what are their abilities and what effect they have. This. Will. Eventually. Make. Pugs. Even. Worse. And imagine the joy of patch day. When/if addon gets broken for any reason 90% of server population won't be able to raid at all.<br />
<br />
*The rest of this post was actually pretty good.* <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
THE OTHER COMMENTS ABOUTTHIS ADD-ON IS UBERPOWERFULBROKENCYDE.<br />
<br />
In order to actually understand how wrong you two are, go out and actually try using the add-on. Once you do that you'll understand why AVR may never actually replace good ol' common sense. Infact, I'll give you one crippling flaw AVR currently possess right off the bat: IT ONLY WORKS IN A 2D PLANE. So if a marker or anything is drawn from another angle other then a birds eye view, it doesn't come out looking alright. Worse off if you're in a place with multiple planes (Sartharion), things will come out looking weird or just plain unhelpful, even going as far as to obstruct one's vision.<br />
<br />
But by all means, bash an experimental add-on. That's how add-on creators get the will to make better ones, by being ungrateful jerk offs who want to flex their e-peen by following he crowd. That's always been great.<br />
<br />
Alright, I'm done with that. here's a new rant.<br />
<br />
What's cocking wrong with using Demo Shout to tank? It's an amazing way to get proximity aggro from anything around the Warrior and it doesn't break CC. To most that's nothing, but if anyone's done anything in Ulduar or ICC, or even Halls of Reflection, that's EXCEPTIONALLY useful.</div></div><hr />

All of that &quot;it makes it too easy, l2p!&quot; has nothing to do with it also. This addon works on the SAME premise that made blizzard say you are not allowed to model-switch, even client side. It was believed that modifying models (even on your own side of the game, not visible to anyone else) could give marginal visual benefits. I think they made an example like:<br />
A player could cause opposite faction players' models in arenas to be larger than normal, or other sort of visual benefits. To me, this is the same idea applied to a raid setting once you toss in the boss mod that automates the drawing of the figures. Mind you, this was blizzard's mindset (from what I remember, if someone can find a blue post about model switching that would be good). I mean, model switching was the SAME idea. It wasn't actually using anything not already in the game, it wasn't giving you any extra stats or moving your character for you, it was just putting models in places that blizzard did not intend for them to be. Which is how I feel about this addon. Why do I care? well, I absolutely love addons. This one though... this is kind of pushing it. <br />

Blizzard can't ban the use of simple operators or they would break every single mod ever made, and pretty much kill mods all together. If they did, someone will just make a mod that assigns arbitrary numbers to pieces of gear and adds them up. Oh wait, that's all gearscore goes.

For example, this addon can tell you where the safespots are from the goo falling down on the raid, during fester or rotface (Can never remember who is who). Can DBM tell you where the goo will land, except then right ontop of you? NO. There you go, the difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, but DBM trivializes every other aspect of the fight. It uses a combination of sound chimes, huge text, whispers, icons, and timers to alert the raid about infections, vile gas, slime spray, explosions, ooze spawns, slime pipes-- any and everything else the boss does. While its not as helpful on this particular fight, DBM does often use raid icons to tell you exactly where to run to.<br />
<br />
DBM has these types of comprehensive databases for every encounter in the game. AVR is only useful on some fights, and most of the time its just making the easiest parts, easier or adding an obvious visual effect on top of an obvious visual effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My problem with AVR-E is simple. It dumbs almost any encounter down to just &quot;move where red/greed/purple circle is pointing you&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the difficulty of &quot;almost any encounter&quot; in the game is dependent on being able to move to a certain spot then this is massive failure on Blizzard's part. We should all be using this energy to demand better raid encounter design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But DBM isn't new! Isn't it the cool thing to do by bashing on new things? Or at least that's what it appears to be based off of the forums lately.<br />
<br />
Baddies will always hate. Those who are 'good' in pve will either use this, or they won't. Either way, this mod isn't going to overcome the margin of error that special people have when playing this game. It will certainly help, but it's not the 'omg this mod plays the game for you' that all the whiners seem to be complaining about.<br />
<br />
Side note: Everybody bitched about Grid, proximo, decursive, etc, when they first got popular and noticed. This mod is no different. Hopefully the retards that are the loudest voice on the public forums (both here and on the wow forums) will find some new shiny object to complain about.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mirrorzoom</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">bigwig mark people with debuff w/ a raid mark, DXE do the same, AVRE use the same exact mechanic to create the circle. The only extra info AVRE provide is the radius of the circle, which is datamined as soon as the patch is released. I think it would be pretty hard for blizzard to actually ban AVRE but still allow bigwig DXE etc, unless they completely ban AVRE's graphing capability, which would mess up a lot of other addons as well.<br />
<br />
People like to use malleable goo as an example against AVRE, but I know for a fact DXE can put a skull on the &quot;likely&quot; target of goo. AVRE use the same approximation method, only it can draw circles on every possible target instead of limiting itself to raid marks only. <br />
<br />
If these circles &quot;isn't intended by blizzard&quot;, so are cooldown timers, flash warnings, and any text aid that tells you what to do in a raid. (lol, Blood Queen bite order addon, Anub'arak penetrating cold addon etc.) Blizzard might as well ban all of those.</div></div><hr />

timers, meters and UI mods like xperl should be ok, but anything that trivializes these encounters just seems like they should be illegal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splorch</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 06:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guild picked it up for our 10 mans, didn't really change the outcome of the fights up to sindragosa, but it made them way smoother, especially on the rotface fight, people know where the tank was. And on on BloodQueen/Putricide/Sindragosa all it was was a visual /Range 10 with the addition of timers on that range 10.<br />
<br />
Thats not exactly a game changer, it just makes it slightly easier and your not looking at your range box and timer. The fights where it excels are the fights are positioning fights, IE Saurfang and Sindragosa, Its a very easy way to mark out positions and return points, all this is doing is making it so that you dont have to lay smoke bombs on sindragosa for the tomb spots, remember the pixels you were standing on for saurfang. ping the minimap on bone spikes (hunters) (this would have been great on the Spider wing end boss in naxx &lt;name escapes me&gt;)<br />
<br />
Things AVR-E does do<br />
&gt;Point you in the direction of bone spikes<br />
&gt;Useless stuff on deathwhisperer just makes the MC target even more blatantly obvious<br />
&gt;Shows you the actual area of spores on festergut (never again will the dps not be close enough to the tanks)<br />
&gt;Tracks the ooze tank on Rotface<br />
&gt;VISUALLY Shows the range on Blood Whirl, Malleable goo and frost tomb (not that diferent from watching to see jimmy and bobby show up on range 10)<br />
&gt; LK - cant talk about this one , no idea<br />
&gt; Minor increase in raid awareness<br />
<br />
Things it doesn't do<br />
&gt; Increase dps<br />
&gt; Tell you where to stand, kite, tank, (avr does that and avr is done by you, no different than printing out the tankspot diagrams)<br />
&gt; Instant victories<br />
&gt;Starts WWIII<br />
&gt;Do anything more than let members see what what you in vain tried to explain to them<br />
&gt; Make you a good player<br />
&gt; Give you free gold and epic Loots</div></div><hr />

Seriously, why is this mod so bad?<br />
Do you see people complaining about shooter games having crosshairs? It basically tells you where you're shooting... in a game where the very essence of the experience is being able to shoot where you're supposed to. What about radars? Or perhaps health bars? It's like saying having teachers at school is cheating because you can just read the books. Isn't this what these mods/aides do: give you the information you're supposed to know in an easier to understand format?<br />
The whole point of visual aides, be it a crosshair, a timer, or a big red circle telling you where some goo might or might not fall is to offset for the difference of information, through sensory perceptions or otherwise, between real world and game world. The whole meaning of a game is to allow you to experience something you probably wouldn't experience in real life. Most if not all the information provided by the combat log is information that you would probably have if you were experiencing a similar situation physically. Information that is lost by experiencing the situation through a small screen and stereo speakers. Sure, they make some of the fights a little easier... but you are seriously overestimating people. It's not necessarily a matter of intelligence. Some people just don't have the concentration, or the reflexes needed to analyse what's happening in a fraction of a second. Most people don't. And most people that do are either playing this game way too much, or just incredibly experienced and focused. The fact is, like was said before, that even with these limited visual aides, lots of players will still fail miserably at things as simple as stepping out of a fire. Even with the billions of helpful boss mods, players still fail at some of the most basic actions in the game.<br />
And that's fine really. If you don't need it, don't use it.<br />
There's one thing I don't understand though. In every discussion about stuff like this, shitloads of people go on about how easy WoW is becoming, and how mod a or b will destroy the game. How come only an extremely small amount of guilds worldwide have even cleared every endgame hardmode? Even ToGC10-25, for which most people are seriously overgeared now, still remain mostly unfinished by the vast, vast majority of people.<br />
Let this discussion die already.<br />
And for the people who think the current content is easy... if you've finished an instance in normal mode, go for achievements, if you've gotten the achievements, go for hardmodes, if even hardmodes are too easy for you, go for achievements in hardmode. And if even that becomes too easy... well... good for you. Try playing it with less players perhaps, I don't know. I think Blizzard, the gay-ass fuck-ups that they are, has at least done a decent enough job at providing an incredibly rich content. Explore the world map some more... do some lowlevel quests, if only for the story... roll an alt... have a wank... whatever really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, most people are just bad at the game. Every human being without some sort of mental / physical handicap is perfectly capable of processing the sensory input provided by the game and eliciting an appropriate response fractions of a second later, it just takes some experience. There is generally a lot going on in any given boss fight and it takes some amount of practice to properly deal with everything at once and not die. This is a video game and it does take certain skills which develop the more that you play it. You can't expect to run into a raid for your first time and instantly be good at raiding just as you can't expect to pick up an Xbox controller and instantly be good at Call of Duty or whatever. <br />

When you really look at what the addon does, visually, this is absolutely no different than what WoW itself does on countless boss fights. <br />
<br />
Lich King puts down a big black circle on the ground that you don't want to stand in.<br />
Lich King puts down a second big black circle in his Hard Mode that you don't want to stand in. <br />
Fire is just a red animated circle on the ground you don't want to stand in<br />
Hodir would drop big white circles on the ground that you DID want to stand in.<br />
Malygos would put down big glowing circles on the ground that you DID want to stand in<br />
Professor Putricide throws Maliable goos during the Festergut Hardmode encounter that put small green circles underneath you that you don't want to stand in.<br />
Sartharion would put down big glowing black circles you didn't want to stand in.<br />
Freya would put down glowing white beams-of-light circles you didn't want to stand in. <br />
Thorim would put down lines of lightning that you didn't want to stand in<br />
<br />
Do I need to go on? I could go through this entire WotLK expansion if you want me to....<br />
<br />
This addon does absolutely nothing that almost every single boss in the game does not already do: Put down giant telegraphed visual signal that &quot;This Is An Area You Do/Don't Want To Be At In a Few Seconds&quot; This Addon is nothing but an extension of the game as it currently stands. To demand that this addon be banned is to demand that almost 90% of the Boss encounters in WotLK no longer telegraph or have any visual indicator of their abilities. <br />
<br />
Scenario 1: A boss does an ability that puts a HUGE FUCKING circle underneath your character. This is okay. <br />
Scenario 2: An addon detects an ability and puts a HUGE FUCKING circle underneath your character. This is NOT okay. <br />

There is no way this is needed unless you're super retarded and don't know i.e. where to go with Tearstorm. You should get the basic grasp of any boss within the first encounter. After that it's just execution. And less tunnel vision. No addon for drawing big circles on the ground will help you, if you suffer from tunnel vision. I remember trying some raiding addon that showed flashy yellow arrows in the direction of the impaled players at Marrowgar - laughable.<br />

I hate to be negative but I have a good feeling blizzard isn't going to like this mod. :-[<br />
<br />
Nor should they tbh. <br />
Using this mod isn't cheating in anyway, but Blizzard still ought to make it unusable.<br />
There got to be a limit on what mods should do.<br />
This mod breaks this limit in my opinion.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't get it. When Blizzard changes the game it's all fine. Arrows on top of your head showing you get icetombed. Huge messages on your screen when you get a debuff or when a boss is doing a special attack.<br />
But when someone makes an addon that shows information you already had (just like Blizzard is doing), it's all bad. THIS is dumbing down the game not all the other things.<br />
It is not so much about dumbing the game down. Its a question of how much influence mods should have.<br />
Blizzard has repeatedly said they balanced encounters around people using boss mods (= timers/warnings and stuff). At some point they added their own simple version of boss mods (= boss messages and symbols on screen) because of this.<br />
Is it really a good thing if Blizz had to balance encounters around the expectancy of people using mods like AVRE though?<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you see people complaining about shooter games having crosshairs? It basically tells you where you're shooting... in a game where the very essence of the experience is being able to shoot where you're supposed to. Those examples are meaningless. In most console shooters you have a little help aiming as well due to gamepads sucking so hard...<br />
BUT the point is the games are balanced around having crosshairs, radars and whatever.<br />
<br />
IF the raiding game is too hard (Which I dont think it is) the answer isn't to have mods that makes the game easier... but instead Blizzard making the game easier. Mods like this is not a good solution as I see it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scenario 1: A boss does an ability that puts a HUGE FUCKING circle underneath your character. This is okay.<br />
Scenario 2: An addon detects an ability and puts a HUGE FUCKING circle underneath your character. This is NOT okay.<br />
<br />

No, not really (though I dont feel angry, just worried).<br />
AVRE is messing with the actual graphical aspect of the game, which is what triggers me compared to timers etc from your average bossmod. <br />
You can't compare the game itself representing a fire you shouldn't stand in, with a mod placing a red circle in the same area.<br />
It makes the representation of the gameworld meaningless. We might as well go back to this:<br />

I just recently installed it, before the whole hype thing, and we (my guild) mainly use it to discuss strategies before hand, its a nice way to have a visual ingame aid to show your raid member where to move when etc. <br />
I turn it off before boss pulls, its just to annoying to have stuff appear on my screen.<br />
But its mostly used to conjure up random drawings of ... stuff <br />
<br />
It will help a great deal on encounters like HC putricide and Sindragosa, but really, people dont even have the attention span to look at bosstimers, warnings or raidchat. a couple of red circles on your screen..</div></div><hr />

You send completed meshes via some channel, much in the same way as you would link a damage meter or something similar. Guild, raid, whisper, or a created channel are all possible. <br />

I was reacting on all the people saying &quot;this dumbs down the game, bla bla bla&quot;. But, you are right. But i think it is kind of hypocrite to say this addon is not right but all the others are. The difference going from no addons to having recount/DBM/omen/etc. compared to going from all these addons to AVR is huge. All addons before AVR/AVRE have a much larger impact on gameplay.<br />
<br />
Saying the game is dumbed down because of addons is wrong in my eyes. You had the same addons in TBC and there is still a huge difference between TBC and WotLK.<br />
<br />
If you would ban addons because &quot;they make the game too easy&quot; then Blizzard shouldn't have let the community use addons at all. But it's too late for that.<br />
And where do you draw the line of what is too easy and what is not? Addons affect peoples gameplay in different ways. Like AVRE will help a noob make less mistakes because he has better visual information. For me it just help to min/max more on hardmode encounters. This addon won't help me die less only make me walk less and do a little more dps because now i can exactly see where to go instead of guessing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's kind of my point, however since there are loads of other, less graphical ways to predict this I'm still not sure whether I concider it to be cheating.<br />
<br />
Personally, I love AVR and intend to keep it. It does nothing we couldn't already do since you use it outside of combat. AVRe however, I'm not sure, it could be concidered cheating (and by could be concider I mean by me, I honestly couldn't give a damn what anyone else thinks) and could draw a lot from my cpu, so I might uninstall it.<br />
<br />
As for the final answer to the question &quot;Is this cheating?&quot;, it's really not our place to argue about it, blizzard will decide, it's their game.<br />
<br />
Ow yes, and to whomever wanted to know why I conder 6 mb a lot of memory, it's because my standard UI, which is pretty heavy already, is 30 mb, so this one addon is 20% of my interface's memory.<br />
<br />
EDIT: and according to the author it takes your FPS down by about 5%, which is not a little amount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not my point, if it makes raiding too easy, then surely a HM LK kill would be within your grasp if you were using it. The point I was trying to make is that there are a lot more factors involved in a encounter then where your fire looks like fire or whether it looks like a red circle</div></div><hr />

Easy boss encounters? Firstly, if a nub feels he or she needs this mod to do boss encounters, it has nothing to do with any of us. <br />
<br />
Let me tell you a story. Last night. Pug to ICC 25 (Was busy this weekend and unable to do the run with my guild) WTFPWNing our way through Marrowgars trash, I'm thinking to myself, this could go well. Very clean idd. Then we got to Marrowgar. Sigh. WE buff up and run in... <br />
<br />
I'm merrily busy tanking away, thinking to myself. Hmm the other two tanks don't really seem to be stacking with me, but never mind, they mihgt just be a little slow to react. But then I think, react to what? We are getting very few Coldflames. And wait a minute. We've been here ages. Why isn't Marrowgar dead? At next bone storm I am dismayed to see that there are litterally 7 Bone Spikes up, and people running around like headless chickens. After the bonestorm, only about 8 people stack in his target box. We hit Enrage. First time ever. Never seen that boss Enrage, even pre nerfs... A quick look at Skada shows 3/4 of the raid sub 4k DPS. <br />
<br />
Needless to say, the group fell apart immediately at the wipe. I yelled, if you don't know tactics FUCKING SAY SO.<br />
<br />
Worried about this addon? In that fateful run, I would say only 10 or so of us knew what we were doing. 4k DPS even with Strength of Wrynn. Not even 30% buff could have saved that group. No amount of addons could either. The cold hard truth is most of the fucking idiots out there probably don't use them... And they certainly don't read this site. <br />
<br />
Some people simply cannot play this game. They just can't do it. They are not a threat to your pride, your kills. They'll never see HC modes. They probably will never even see Rotface or Festergut, even with 30% buff. And it is sad to say. 5 years in, and people still cannot play this game. <br />
<br />
I use DBM, and could see the use of AVR for marking and positioning etc. Save us making flares and shit. But I don't see the use for it on bosses. All it does is replace the basic awareness that a player attempting any boss should have anyway.</div></div><hr />

That already exists, it's called botting. You'd be surprised how sophisticated bots are these days.<br />
<br />
But since botting isn't allowed and bots are banned by Blizzard, I find your paranoia highly ridiculous.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LanceDH</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I haven't use the addon in a raid yet, but I think it's pretty cool.<br />
I think it would be rather usefull to explain tactics to people, though it could make the actual fight alot easier.<br />
IMO Blizzard shouldn't ban the addon as it's easier for tactics, but maybe the addon should hide all the markings once you enter combat ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Littlehalo</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This addon declines your imagination. As always you could remember the spot where you were standing or to where you had to move according to a ground texture for ex. But now, since the game is tuned for 12y+, that can barely write in their own language or understand simple scripted tactic, it's kinda as clear as crystal that they lack of imagination as well. This addon, the colored circles and arrows, provide them imagination. This is sad. Raiding is going to look like running from circle to circle, forget about &quot;/range 10&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
This Addon works for now, the encounters are going to be a lot easier, people would get used to play with that and epix will drop more often than rain in Amazonian forests. When blizzard is going to disable it (at some point I hope), the new born circle-fallowers are going to fail and the amount of so called &quot;good raidiers&quot; is going to drop drastically.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rangerfox</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tried this addon with avre last night in icc 10.<br />
Didn't seem to function very well at all. For Putricide it put up random circles all over the place yet there were no dangers to be seen. For blood princes the empowered shock radius didn't function at all. If anything, the addon confused me and made me play worse, not better.<br />
<br />
It might be more useful as a marking tool than anything else, but unless this addon is made more stable and reliable, it's not going to be replacing people's brains anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

It takes you from 20 to 19:) imagine every single addon doing that, jesus christ people I was only listing the small amount of bad aspects to this addon's design, L2take things in perspective</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zephire</div><div class="date">2010-04-26, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this addon should be disabled and/or banned. If it were a tool to use to tell people where to stand without aggroing the boss and when in combat you shouldn't be able to use it, now THAT would indeed be nice.<br />
<br />
BUT!<br />
Behold a new tool to increase elitism!<br />
Why? Becouse now there is a easier way of learning bossfights then ever before, and this isn't a Blizzard standard addon, which means people (like my self) who will NEVER use this addon will learn the bosses slower (this doesn't mean I'm a bad player, it means that I drive the car and read the map at the same time, compared to driving and using a voice gps). If everyone used this thing, and every bossfight were so hard and had so much going on, like LK HC with Proffesor put and 3 drakes at the same time, then fine, you'll need the help. As it is now though, if I'm abit slower to learn then ppl using this addon I'll be a &quot;OMFG, you bloody scrubb of a noob! Why the hell didn't you move out of the fire?!&quot; becouse of the tolerance level of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
As if DMB and Blizzard Bossmod isn't enough, example:<br />
10 man normal Lich King, hard, eh? I were new to the fight and I use DBM, BlizzBossmod and omen in PvE. I'm tanking the adds as a paladin, flawlessly in p1, then in the transition I tank the rageing spirits, the tank who tanked LK in p1 also helps out, but he turns them towards the raid now and then, no real danger just bad play from him/her. So we enter p2 and I fuck up on Defile, there is some stuff going on with me being able to save ppl from valkyrs with HoJ and such, still had a raging spirit on me etc, I droped the defile in midle of the raid, well, imagen a big dark cloud killing everyone. Fine, was my first try in p2. Sec try, p1 and transition as smoth as before. This time some one else fuck up and ppl complaingin about me position the raging spirit wrong, ah you wanted them there asap? Didn't matter that the raid get silenced when I move them? KK I'll do that next try. and I did, I did the 3d try without bigg misstakes, but they though I were stupid so they let an other tank, tank who knew the fight and the offtanking... I were dps and gosh that tank were SO bad! After a wipe in p1 with him I were told to tank again and they stoped complaining about my tanking.<br />
Aight, you've read that, congratz! Now to my point. Imagen the senario above with them using the marking addon and I'm not, I'd do exactly the same learningpath as above but they would deman perfection from start. If I failed 1st try I'd be classefied as a very bad player, which I'm not, I would say I'm one of the better players on the server, on horde.<br />
<br />
This could create something even worse then GearScore IMO, the playerbase DEMAND epics, and with this addon a decent or even fairly bad player will get epics so easy, only fights which won't be &quot;free&quot; epics would be dpsfights with movement, here bad players would not manage couse they can't do awsome dps, nor move at the same time. Its a stupid addon which couldn't be in game. Don't take it personal Mr Creators of this addon, I bet you've done a very very nice jobb and you should be prised for how good you're at coding, but I still hate this addon :P</div></div><hr />

The major thing it did for us was Sindragosa hardmode, where you have 6 blocks. With an addon marking up beaconed players, and the icons on the ground, it is impossible to fuck up the positioning on the blocks. <br />
<br />
See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meTZAvYCzlE&amp;feature=youtube_gdata for an example on sindragosa (we use shapes cause we have some colorblind ;))</div></div><hr />

Since it currently has bugs while in combat, I use it mainly to walk people through positions before the boss fight. This is useful for things like where to stand for each LK phase and where to put the blocks and boss on Sindragosa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I love AVR and intend to keep it. It does nothing we couldn't already do since you use it outside of combat. AVRe however, I'm not sure, it could be concidered cheating (and by could be concider I mean by me, I honestly couldn't give a damn what anyone else thinks) and could draw a lot from my cpu, so I might uninstall it.<br />
<br />
As for the final answer to the question &quot;Is this cheating?&quot;, it's really not our place to argue about it, blizzard will decide, it's their game.<br />
<br />
Ow yes, and to whomever wanted to know why I conder 6 mb a lot of memory, it's because my standard UI, which is pretty heavy already, is 30 mb, so this one addon is 20% of my interface's memory.<br />
<br />
EDIT: and according to the author it takes your FPS down by about 5%, which is not a little amount.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you're using 30gb worth of addons, they must all be purely cosmetic then, yeah? They don't give you any information (provided to you via in game API) that you normally wouldn't have had, right? Right? <br />
<br />
You people complaining have to follow under two groups:<br />
<br />
1) the &quot;thinks he is hardcore player&quot; who is afraid a &quot;casual&quot; will catch up to his gearscore with the help of this addon.<br />
2) the &quot;i'll use this addon, or any other addon that has combat benefits, but pretend i don't so i look like a wow gaming god&quot; hypocrite.<br />

AVR is fantastic. Absolutely brilliant. We have a scene drawn for HM Sindra that gets everyone's heads in the same place. AVR does not play the game for you. It does not tell you exactly where to stand at all times. It does not draw arrows and circles of where to go for the most part. It visualizes certain information that most people already use(HELLO RANGE CHECK) so instead of reading text off of a window, I can get that information in a more intuitive way, making me an overall better player.<br />
<br />
I don't remember this much controversy over addons for Mother in BT, and that was pretty darn similar. In fact, those addons might have been worse given that they gave you an arrow of where to run.</div></div><hr />
