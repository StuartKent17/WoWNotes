Patch 4.1 Public Test Realm Notes - April 8 #2<br />
The Patch 4.1 PTR notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/160430/patch-41-public-test-realm-notes-april-8) have been updated slightly after Blizzard published the update on their blog yesterday. The change to allow player to use flying mounts in Ghostlands was removed and Sinestra is being slightly tweaked. <br />
General<br />
<br />
Flying mounts can now be used in Ghostlands.<br />
Several persistent ground effects now display different visuals for hostile and friendly players. The following spells have the same visual effects for friendly players, but new alternate visuals for hostile players: Ring of Frost, Consecration, Desecration, Wild Mushroom, Flare, Ice Trap, Power Word: Barrier, Smoke Bomb, and Hand of Gul'dan. As a general rule, the alternate effects have a red tint or hue indicating they are created by an enemy player. There are currently some issues with this new change which are affecting several of these abilities and is not working as intended at this time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Sinestra<br />
<br />
Twilight Slicer is now less likely to target two helers at once.<br />
Wrack will avoid jumping to tanks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guilds<br />
Guild Challenges<br />
<br />
Gold rewards require the qualified guild members of the group to be honored with their guild, and the guild must be are now deposited into the guild bank once the guild reaches level 5. The text for the Cash Flow guild perk has been updated appropriately. <br />
<br />
<br />

Blue posts outside of announcements almost feel like christmas lately, I wonder if anyone is going to bring cookies. <br />
Making WoW Easier<br />
I understand and respect gaming masochism. But, I think that changing mechanics to be more reasonable and less punishing is an improvement, not a detriment, to games in general. Many of us Original Gamers pine for the days of D&amp;D-based yore when games were seemingly intended to break us down into sobbing masses created by an uncaring necromancer of pain and suffering, or at least didn't try to avoid it. Overcoming all of the obstacles (I CHOOSE NOT TO SHOOT HER WITH THE SILVER ARROW... NOOOOO) was a big part of what gaming (I HAVE 1 LIFE!?), and especially PC gaming (HOW DO I LOAD MOUSE DRIVERS?), were about. But, I feel we're lucky to now be in an age where those ideals (intended or not) are giving way to actual fun, actual challenge, and not fabricating it through high-reach requirements (I NEED A FAIRY MONK WITH A MAGIC LOCKPICK?).<br />
<br />
What we've always been trying to do, what WoW has always been about (and to which much of its success is due) is to make an accessible MMO. Anyone that looks back at the game at launch and wishes it was as challenging now as it was then is not aware of the painstaking effort put into making this game accessible as compared to its predecessors. Since release we've refined that intent, eventually evolving the very few masochistic designs WoW actually ever started with, but ideally still offering those same prestige goals that give that feeling of achieving something great if you're able to pull it off. We've made a lot of progress toward striking that balance and continuing to evolve the game, but it's not something we're ever likely to perfect, and we'll be constantly working to hit that elusive goal. Hopefully it's to the benefit of everyone playing and enjoying the game, and they'll continue to enjoy the journey that a living, breathing, persistent universe will take us on.

Granted, there will be people who will try this, but the very idea of doing it will be crushed right when people join the instance. People are already extremely cynical when it comes to players with bad gear, especially when it comes to tanks and healers, so why on earth would that change with this new system? Also, even if the people in the group would accept the badly geared tank, which I very much doubt, do you think the person will be able to stay long after his first wipe, which will be the very first pack of mobs? The system is enough unforgiving for this behaviour to simply die off, while the point of the rewards to get the more skilled people to join the queu will still be there, and will only be available to the person who can do their role well and finish the instance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's amazing how Blizzard, or at least these guys currently working on WoW, don't understand gaming at all. It's not about masochism or punishing content, it's about providing an artificial challenge of increasing difficulty. Video games since the beginning have had levels that get increasingly difficult, meaning that to get further and see more you need to improve your skills at the game. Yes if you jump straight to the last level it may seem like punishing and unreasonable, but that's just because you haven't gained the skills necessary to reach that level yet.<br />
<br />
Dumbing down the game has been happening since WotLK because a large part of the players and designers are not gamers. They're people who fuck around Sims or Farmville and who think just paying for the game means they should get a free ride through it. And that's fine if Blizzard actually stated what they're doing up front: &quot;There's a lot more money being made from the Facebook 'gamers' than real gamers so that's who we will develop for.&quot; But they don't have the balls to admit that.<br />
<br />
We've made a lot of progress toward striking that balance and continuing to evolve the game, but it's not something we're ever likely to perfect, and we'll be constantly working to hit that elusive goal.<br />
<br />
Even the designers themselves admit they're not skilled enough to get it right. Do they think their customers want to keep paying monthly to see them &quot;try their hardest&quot;? Fuck no, if you can't get it right then quit and let Blizzard hire people who can get it right - they've had plenty of these people in the past.</div></div><hr />

This kind of game is not ever possible to get perfectly balanced. Blizzard does know and acknowledge that fact. I'm amazed that there are idiots like you around who actually think that WoW would magically turn into 100% perfect and balanced game just by changing the blizzard staff :)</div></div><hr />

Most of the people you get in dungeon finder are like that already, can't see the call to arms making it any worse. At least it offers the _GOOD_ players something extra to que as tank for you.</div></div><hr />

I stopped tanking with cata mostly because I was tired of the idiots, but the bribery is enough to make me restart work on tanking. <br />
<br />
I've been tanking since paladins could tank, it was merely social reasons why I stopped. So the idea blizz is shooting for will work, for me, at least.</div></div><hr />

Come back when you got 12k achievement points, sinestra 0 death achievement and 140mounts. Then you can call the game easy. But I don't think anyone close to achieveing that thinks it's easy.</div></div><hr />

Usually they join the instance, race to the boss they want their item from, then exit the instance and leave the rest of the group hanging.<br />

The Dungeon Finder created tons of bad tanks from DPS lacking the patience for less than instant queues to begin with, before queues were as bad as they are now; Those players coincidentally don't have the anywhere near a skill level proportional to their arrogance. Now, Blizzard is rewarding and supporting those players and going to create even more of them. Awesome.</div></div><hr />

WoW was never planned to be a copy of Everquest, it was always meant to be an accessible MMO and that's why it's such a successful game. At Vanilla it was more alike Everquest because Blizzard knew no better. As more games are made, new ideas come up, WoW will become more and more like the current games. <br />
<br />
People that enjoy gaming masochism only play WoW because it's the most popular MMO that exists, not because they really like the game. They are only following the band wagon. IMO, all those people should quit WoW and go find a game that suits their playstyle better.</div></div><hr />

But, I think that changing mechanics to be more reasonable and less punishing is an improvement, not a detriment, to games in general.<br />
<br />
It's amazing how Blizzard, or at least these guys currently working on WoW, don't understand gaming at all. It's not about masochism or punishing content, it's about providing an artificial challenge of increasing difficulty. Video games since the beginning have had levels that get increasingly difficult, meaning that to get further and see more you need to improve your skills at the game. Yes if you jump straight to the last level it may seem like punishing and unreasonable, but that's just because you haven't gained the skills necessary to reach that level yet.<br />
<br />
Dumbing down the game has been happening since WotLK because a large part of the players and designers are not gamers. They're people who fuck around Sims or Farmville and who think just paying for the game means they should get a free ride through it. And that's fine if Blizzard actually stated what they're doing up front: &quot;There's a lot more money being made from the Facebook 'gamers' than real gamers so that's who we will develop for.&quot; But they don't have the balls to admit that.<br />
<br />
We've made a lot of progress toward striking that balance and continuing to evolve the game, but it's not something we're ever likely to perfect, and we'll be constantly working to hit that elusive goal.<br />
<br />
Even the designers themselves admit they're not skilled enough to get it right. Do they think their customers want to keep paying monthly to see them &quot;try their hardest&quot;? Fuck no, if you can't get it right then quit and let Blizzard hire people who can get it right - they've had plenty of these people in the past.<br />
<br />
I think they understand gaming better then any gaming company out there, and i think they provide us with much more fun-factor then any other gaming company too. This has always been about numbers, what category has the most players, and then they rub that players back. If you dont understand the simplest buisiness fundamentals you will never understand any company gaming or other why they do certain things.<br />
<br />
Cata has for the game been a setback, simply beacuse the simplest way for casuals to have fun in insances is too hard. Yeah you read right, not all people have been gaming hardcore since the late 1990's like myself and think wow is childsplay when it comes to difficulty. For the casual player, who represent the bulk of all players in wow this game is currently too hard. Most casual guilds have not come past 10/12 normal yet and i bet the new raid instance is not that far off.<br />
<br />
Tho i do agree, that making an encounter too RNG to make it hard is the wrong approach. Tho the only other way is timed mechanics which you either have to avoid or confront, and im unsure how well that would turn out. And you would need 20 different one for 25 man at the same time, so that its hard enough for the worlds top 20 guilds to fight over.</div></div><hr />

Greedy moron DPS will take their full green tank reroll just for the reward. <br />
<br />
And if a real tank want to do his daily, he'll wait for the reward to be available before starting the queue. he won't really care, it's instant queue anyway. So if your main character is pure DPS, well you'll still wait the same amount of time because tank won't come unless the queue is over 20min for their reward.<br />
<br />
Good call Blizzard, you really enjoy rewarding noobs who can't play, don't want to help in the first place and who are greedy enough just to do it if you can have more gold.<br />

Sounds like you're just bad at the game and not casual. My guild is casual and we're at 1/13 hc, and we only started raiding 2 months ago. This game is still challenging and it should be! If you don't like it, find another game to play, maybe WoW is just not for you.</div></div><hr />

No, this video is an example of what PTRs are for - testing. Everyone can go and create a level 85 tank/healer/dps with few clicks, so ofc everyone vent for it to try the Call to Arms system. Do you think everyone will reroll on live, I do not think so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Current evidence suggests that there are two (possibly more) tiers of rare projects.<br />
<br />
This is particularly evident with Tol'Vir where the Ring and Scarab Amulet both seem to be a lot more common than the others (also because they are all epic as opposed to Rare/Epic mix). A lot of the projects need a particular skill level to drop. I can't see the new blue drops requiring the same level as the sword, so assuming someone is starting fresh I wouldn't be at all surprised that pretty much everyone will have those by the time they max (Similar to the Clockwork Gnome, Raptor Pet, Raptor Mount). Ultimately there's no evidence that adding those two troll projects wil affect the sword project appearance rate. (And I've 2 maxed archaeologist, one with 21 rares and another with 14 - skipped Northrend/Outland on the second one, and no sword)<br />
<br />
To be honest I'm more annoyed about the Vyrkul one as now i'll have to go back to get that one after having already got the Vyrkul/Nerubian rares. At least Vyrkul sites are dime a dozen<br />
<br />
Just going for the Tol'Vir stuff get's Troll (though not that many) though, with already having the Elf Trinket on both , the Night Elf sites are wasted.<br />
<br />
I'm still not sure why there are no dwarf sites in Northrend, yet there are Night Elf ones<br />
<br />

Sorry Blizzard but that's where you turned the road to wrong direction. Word &quot;accessible&quot; should be like 100th in the priority list for a good game, &quot;challenge&quot; is #1.

The thing that gets me is that the game has always been &quot;accessible.&quot; It really has. I don't have any problem with the game being accessible. The problem is that there has to be a minimum standard of expectation. The original Super Mario Bros. was accessible, but you still had to know what you were doing to beat it. Vanilla was accessible, but you still had to know what you were doing to beat it. <br />
<br />
My issue is that removing skill and challenge as factors from the game outside of heroic mode raids has nothing to do with accessibility and everything to do with catering to entitled casuals. Not all casuals are bad. I'm playing casually right now because of my work schedule. The difference is that I'm okay with not getting heroic Sinestra loot when I don't have time to raid. Entitled casuals feel entitled to shiny raid epics without investing time or effort to get them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damn right they don't! Lol... might overthink that one a bit. <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure Warcraft, Starcraft and Diablo aren't some of the most successful and critically acclaimed gaming series by accident.<br />
<br />
Sure Blizz caters to the masses, and who would blame them for it... but at the same time they manage to put out content that is so challenging that even the most hardcore of raiding guilds had to admit it was brutal. When I think about T11 raiding (especially Heroic mode) &quot;dumbed down&quot; is about the last thing that would come to my mind.<br />
<br />
My guess is you never played anything else other than WoW, otherwise you would realize that your crying at a very high level... Blizzard is actually doing a pretty damn good job at understanding gaming and making their games attractive to all kinds of players.</div></div><hr />

link this and link that, worst argument ever to say a game is hard, i stopped 1 month after cataclysm, because it really was a bad expansion, most of it was bad, only thing that was &quot;good&quot; was that heroics was &quot;decently&quot; challenging, and that was only because so so so many people could not play the game properly (CC, interrupts, damage skull).<br />
<br />
People stopped in Cata, not because it was too hard, but because it was to fucking boring, 10 and 25 man share same lockout, haha. Awesome idea, and so on. when you've done your raid/pvp/daily, there's nothing to do in this game, except maybe do some old school stuff or achievements. mind you that's crap achievements like doing Wailing Caverns or something.</div></div><hr />

Granted, there will be people who will try this, but the very idea of doing it will be crushed right when people join the instance. People are already extremely cynical when it comes to players with bad gear, especially when it comes to tanks and healers, so why on earth would that change with this new system? Also, even if the people in the group would accept the badly geared tank, which I very much doubt, do you think the person will be able to stay long after his first wipe, which will be the very first pack of mobs? The system is enough unforgiving for this behaviour to simply die off, while the point of the rewards to get the more skilled people to join the queu will still be there, and will only be available to the person who can do their role well and finish the instance.<br />

What's with all the babies thinking a &quot;challenge&quot; means farming for days on end and spending hours finding 40 people to get a raid group together just to get into content. That's not a challenge, that just means the people who get access to the content simply have no lives. The bosses are significantly tougher and much more dynamic than they were in vanilla. The only reason vanilla and BC bosses SEEM more unique is because they were nowhere near as accessible. It wasn't a challenge to get to these bosses. It was merely tedious, monotonous, and BOOOOORING.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kujja</div><div class="date">2011-04-09, 03:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they understand gaming better then any gaming company out there, and i think they provide us with much more fun-factor then any other gaming company too. This has always been about numbers, what category has the most players, and then they rub that players back. If you dont understand the simplest buisiness fundamentals you will never understand any company gaming or other why they do certain things.<br />
<br />
Cata has for the game been a setback, simply beacuse the simplest way for casuals to have fun in insances is too hard. Yeah you read right, not all people have been gaming hardcore since the late 1990's like myself and think wow is childsplay when it comes to difficulty. For the casual player, who represent the bulk of all players in wow this game is currently too hard. Most casual guilds have not come past 10/12 normal yet and i bet the new raid instance is not that far off.<br />
<br />
Tho i do agree, that making an encounter too RNG to make it hard is the wrong approach. Tho the only other way is timed mechanics which you either have to avoid or confront, and im unsure how well that would turn out. And you would need 20 different one for 25 man at the same time, so that its hard enough for the worlds top 20 guilds to fight over.<br />
<br />
12/12 normal is supposed to be the accessible content, and it's really not that hard (except for Nef maybe). If a guild raids 5 hours a week and still needs to kill 2 bosses - they should get them down in a few weeks, and if they can't then I honestly don't know how people can be that bad to not be able to understand tactics, there's hundreds of guides for these bosses now as well as some nerfs since Cata's release, if geared players still cannot clear normal modes, then I believe they shouldn't be allowed to.<br />
Also - Firelands is probably about 2 months away, so there's plenty of time for people to clear content.</div></div><hr />

So, you only played for a month? During the time which the only thing people were really doing was heroics, which you say was good. And the game is boring because 10/25 man share lockouts, so you can't the exact same content twice in a week? yet you never stuck around long enough to actually do the raid.<br />
<br />
And after you finish your raid/pvp/dailies YOU CAN GO OUTSIDE!

Raiding is not everything. I'm a hardcore raider, cleared every raid content before major nerfes and have never been so bored before. (and the one right now is also clear since 8th feb.) <br />
Besides raiding there is NOTHING to do. Classic were = &lt;3! In BC they nerfed quite some things but improved also a lot. The whole thing began with WotLK, and now in Cataclysm it's getting more and more pathetic.<br />

Agree. <br />
<br />
All true tanks (the good ones) already don't need nothing from hcs and probably some part only do it for valor and I bet most of them prefer to queue with guild m8s. <br />
<br />
So the tanks you see on hcs are bad tanks or ungear tanks. That will not change to worse. Already is! You get 1% chance to get a good tank (probably guild m8s offline or did daily before).<br />
This change will bring many good tanks to queue ALONE again and that what people want right?<br />
Even if they have all pets the change to get flasks, pots and extra gold is way better then losing time farming herbs :/<br />
At least I will be one. <br />
<br />
I will still do daily with guild m8s to help them but if i see Call of Arms On for tanks and I'm bored I will queue for extra flaks or pots for my raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now a month later we have blue posts of things like being able to knock out your heroics in a day if you wanted<br />
your giving incentive to tanks and heals to do said heroics<br />
your letting people buy conquest now<br />
you give off tabards so people can get the easily attainable weekly guild rep cap even quicker.<br />
are you making the game easier? maybe sure. truthfully I see it as a cop out.<br />
you realize you cant compete with this new MMO Rift because its actually good and instead of trying to fight to bring something to wow that players will enjoy you turn around make the game more casual for many people so they can play two mmo's at once if they wanted to.<br />
<br />
Hell you even go as far as to rip off concepts from a game that hasnt even been live but a month such as guild weekly quests.<br />
<br />
Secondly and im quite serious. Archeology is a waste of time for alot of players right now, the entire tradeskill is beyond boring with little to no reward for us agi dps<br />
casters , melee now tanks all have 359 items that were considered very good items in game to take into raiding with where hunters, rogues, druids got left behind<br />
sure if your a pet/mount collector there was some little reward but seriously blizzard where is the love for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

We say this because you claim that &quot;lol Cata is so easy and boring,&quot; yet you have not done any of the actual challenging stuff in the game. Hell, I remember Blizzard making fun of people last expansion for claiming that raids they had never done before were too easy. I have done every raid tier in the game except for SWP and Heroic ICC, and I can say that I have been thoroughly impressed with every single Cata hardmode except for Conclave heroic. My guild is 8/13 at the moment, and I cannot WAIT to learn heroic Nefarian this week. Personally, I am glad that 10 and 25 share the same lockout. NOTHING was more boring than clearing the 10 man normal, 10 man heroic, 25 man normal, and 25 man heroic versions of ToGC every week. <br />
<br />
As others have said, it is true that WoW is not just about raiding; however, the most challenging content in this game has always been the raids and earning top PvP rankings. If you claim that Cataclysm is &quot;easy and boring,&quot; then you likely have not step foot in any of the raid instances or PvPed your way to the top. <br />
<br />
&quot;But Freese, I'm not a raider or a PvPer. I want more difficult solo content.&quot; To the people who say this, I might ask what you are even doing in this game then? This is a massive multiplayer online game, not a single player game. There are plenty of personal achievements for the single player type, but the majority of difficult content in this game will always be centered around raiding and PvP.</div></div><hr />

And if he don't want to go outside? If he don't want to pay 12€ for playing few hours a week? Because there is nothing to do?<br />
If WoW is getting easier and easier I will for sure cancel my 3 subscriptions, which have been active since almost 6 years now.<br />
<br />
Feel free to play any other current mmo if you think WoW is easy. They're all easier. If you want a real challenge, go back to playing MUDs. If you truly have 3 accounts and cleared all hardmodes by Feb 8th, it sounds like too much of your life revolves around this game. Maybe just do something else with all that free time. Yes, Cataclysm is boring to me except for raiding, but that's the result of WotLK being way too easy, and so I finished almost everything else I could do that expansion. All reps are maxed, got my insane title, all solo achievements done, etc. If since started playing my 360 much more, played around with RIFT some, and just relaxed.<br />
<br />
This game would not survive another Vanilla raid setup. The vast majority of those who play WoW these days would not grind dungeons and raids for months just to get a gear set to beat 1 boss. They wouldn't like being forced to heal or switch races b/c dwarf priest healers are required to defeat that boss. If blizzard made Cataclysm like Vanilla, you'd see subscriptions drop dramatically. The game has changed, the player base has changed, accept it or move on.</div></div><hr />

oh wow is an accessible MMO but when it comes to endgame content, this game turns into an UNaccessible HGO, hardcore guilds online game.<br />
<br />
Exactly, it WAS an accessible MMO in Wrath but people (Vanilla hardcore freaks) cried rivers on how they weren't special anymore, and no one looked up to them and their super gear because EVERYONE looked the same. That epic gear was no longer epic and was cheapened to make the masses happy. Now that they have tried to make people from Vanilla happy the game sucks ... I should know, I was IN vanilla the game was horrible then and really why would ANYONE want to play it again. I had joined warcraft the same week before ZG had been added as raid content. I raided some back then and did. not. like. it. 40 Man raids were shit, not enough loot dropped to justifying raiding because you had too many people to roll between.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Dungeon Finder created tons of bad tanks from DPS lacking the patience for less than instant queues to begin with, before queues were as bad as they are now; Those players coincidentally don't have the anywhere near a skill level proportional to their arrogance. Now, Blizzard is rewarding and supporting those players and going to create even more of them. Awesome.<br />
<br />
You ONLY get the reward bag when you finish the dungeon. Any bad tanks like in the comic will fail their first few times and give up. Let me ask you this. If you spend 3 hour ´tanking´and failing and never getting your reward bad... doesn´t waiting in a ´now´ 15 minute queue to be carried as a DPS sound much better?. The first week will be terrible with these new tanks, but after that, you will mainly have good tanks just doing more dungeons, or else guild tanks occassionally doing full pug runs. Also remember, that when this goes live, we will also be getting easy 353 epics, which gives even more of a buffer for tanks and healers to not be ´great´. When cata started, you usually had 3 dps doing 7 or 8k dps and healers that were always on the verge of running out of mana. Now you often see 3 dps over 12k and healers not really struggling. All of that will make things MUCH easier on tanks.</div></div><hr />

They're all easier. If you want a real challenge, go back to playing MUDs. If you truly have 3 accounts and cleared all hardmodes by Feb 8th, it sounds like too much of your life revolves around this game. Maybe just do something else with all that free time.<br />
We're currently raiding 2 times a week. There is enough spare time :P<br />
And all other MMO's suck even more. Exception would be Rift. There are some cool things in it, but dunno.. not the same<br />
<br />
<br />
This game would not survive another Vanilla raid setup. The vast majority of those who play WoW these days would not grind dungeons and raids for months just to get a gear set to beat 1 boss. They wouldn't like being forced to heal or switch races b/c dwarf priest healers are required to defeat that boss. If blizzard made Cataclysm like Vanilla, you'd see subscriptions drop dramatically. The game has changed, the player base has changed, accept it or move on.<br />
<br />
Yeah, but your class meant was unique something special. Right now, the whole homogenization destroys all class uniqueness. <br />
Some of these 12 mio. players out there loved hardcore raiding/nerding (im sure you also! /wave @ insane titel :p ). They should just implement a classic realm. More than enough would pay for it.<br />

If you can't narrow your focus and stop having to waste time with dig sites that have nothing left to obtain but vendor grays, where is the improvement? There are ways make the profession feel more worthwhile without making it easier, and allowing one to make meaningful progress besides completing their 30th black trilobite or 25th troll planter. If you have everything else in one race finished, add 0.1% to the chance for it's epic for each completion thereafter. Allow one race's sites to be turned off for the day.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, there were just too many exploits to fix. There were so many ´holes´in the map that people were constantly finding ways to get under the map or into ZA on the PTR.<br />
<br />
The other part of it is that it just isn´t necessary.... when was the last time you took your flying mount to BRC or even to GB. Flying in Ghostlands was only added for ZA accessibility.. but then in 4.06 they removed the requirement to discover dungeon entrances.<br />
<br />
So it just came down to is it worth it for them to have to find the 150 exploit spots on the map for the few players who would actually fly there. My guess is it is being pushed back, not removed. Honestly, give me a flying mount and Ghostlands, and I will find a crack in the map within an hour. It is just not worth it to have goldfarmers exploiting on live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's amazing how Blizzard, or at least these guys currently working on WoW, don't understand gaming at all. It's not about masochism or punishing content, it's about providing an artificial challenge of increasing difficulty. Video games since the beginning have had levels that get increasingly difficult, meaning that to get further and see more you need to improve your skills at the game. Yes if you jump straight to the last level it may seem like punishing and unreasonable, but that's just because you haven't gained the skills necessary to reach that level yet.<br />
<br />
Dumbing down the game has been happening since WotLK because a large part of the players and designers are not gamers. They're people who fuck around Sims or Farmville and who think just paying for the game means they should get a free ride through it. And that's fine if Blizzard actually stated what they're doing up front: &quot;There's a lot more money being made from the Facebook 'gamers' than real gamers so that's who we will develop for.&quot; But they don't have the balls to admit that.<br />
<br />
We've made a lot of progress toward striking that balance and continuing to evolve the game, but it's not something we're ever likely to perfect, and we'll be constantly working to hit that elusive goal.<br />
<br />
Even the designers themselves admit they're not skilled enough to get it right. Do they think their customers want to keep paying monthly to see them &quot;try their hardest&quot;? Fuck no, if you can't get it right then quit and let Blizzard hire people who can get it right - they've had plenty of these people in the past.<br />
<br />
I wonder, what am I most amazed by, your stupidity or your ignorance, maybe both?<br />
This is first of all following the exact pattern you talked about, increased difficulty as you progress, you may not feel that because you spend about same time on every boss, I dont know, but thats because you learn from the past and just get better, I dont know or care.<br />
One more thing, can you really hate that everyone can experience content, but that the skilled players can do it earlier?<br />
Or do you want it to be 1000 guilds in the world that can kill a certain boss, even if 2 expansion passes because they are dealing damage on a % off your HP and mechanics are insane?<br />
They let casuals come after and experience the lore and fun, but first the skilled players, if you hate that then you probably hate to hate, not because you dislike it.<br />
Blizzard is saying that they dont want to make the low tier content (halfus, conclave, magmaw etc) insanely hard, while making sinestra insanely hard.<br />
And really, did you really say the thing about they dont got the skill to make it right?<br />
A game were its PvE, PvP, 10 classes, 12 races and all is different, please tell me how you will make a 100% balance.<br />
You can get close, like blizzard, but 100% is not doable because classes, races are different. Only way to do it is forcing everyone to be a human warrior, and the one pushing his button fastest (or using most skills, who cares) is the winning one. <br />
Please, cant people understand that if you clearly dont know what you talk about, you should shut up and leave talking to people knowing whats going on, it anoys me that people still dont know this.<br />
<br />
And on some side nots: Awesome comic, I loved it<br />
And noooooooo, why ghostlands! ): (I know why, no reason to inform me) I still wanted to hang around there, its the kind off place I would like to just hang around at in the air.</div></div><hr />

So you're in favor of having all 25 members of your raid complete a quest to enter an instance? You must have never raided Onyxia when you had to have 40 people complete one quest just to kill one raid boss.<br />

I'm all for them pushing it back to prevent gold farming. The &quot;not worth the effort&quot; argument doesn't apply quite as much to me. Blizzard takes pride in their games, and I hope to see them finish what they've started. Old Wold flying was a BIG DEAL to implement, so I can understand them not having time for the BC areas at the same time. Anything Blizzard can do to keep players from camping SW/Org constantly will be a vast improvement to the game. Even if it's something as slight as adding arch dig sites to flight-renovated BC zones. I agree that it shouldn't be a high priority, but saying &quot;when was the last time you actually stopped city-camping in WoW&quot; is just apathy. I'd rather play WoW as a game than a virtual chat-room. Unfortunately, not many people will agree with me on this. Luckily, Blizzard puts quality above opinion.</div></div><hr />

yo if u have a problem with what designers is best for the game you have 3 options. 1) go find a mmo that doesnt hold your hand and has a higher difficulty level(there are lots out there so im not going to waste my time listing them). 2) find a way to show them your oppinion (without bashing them) and that the wow community as a whole wants it. 3) apply for their job and fix it yourself (sence you think that its as easy as saying i want this to be perfect ). until then stop bashing the designers cause their job from blizzard is to keep the community as a whole happy and attract new players to the game( and keep them there), so ya their goal may not be completely aimed at the hardcore gamers now, but games as a whole have took that turn not just wow. im not saying im happy with the way the gaming world is going but unlike you im trying to fix it( currently in school for this)</div></div><hr />

pretty good point, although the idea of wow being turn based makes me a little sick, rpgs were that at one time and can still be fun.

<br />
People stopped in Cata, not because it was too hard, but because it was to fucking boring, 10 and 25 man share same lockout, haha. Awesome idea, and so on. when you've done your raid/pvp/daily, there's nothing to do in this game, except maybe do some old school stuff or achievements. mind you that's crap achievements like doing Wailing Caverns or something.<br />
<br />
People stopped playing when they tried to do instances and couldn't complete even 1 via LFD ( Blizzards preferred grouping method)<br />
<br />
When i went to Blizzcon I told everyone I could that I was a Tank on strike. the removal AOE tanking was one of the worst things ever done to this game. A tank should be able to run in and grab a group of 1 to 10 mobs and keep all of their attention while the DPS nuke them. it shouldn't take a twitch gamer to play a RPG. i shouldn't have to worry about hopping targets to keep threat on them my AOE abilities should do it for me, like in WOTLK.<br />

<br />
12/12 normal is supposed to be the accessible content, and it's really not that hard (except for Nef maybe). If a guild raids 5 hours a week and still needs to kill 2 bosses - they should get them down in a few weeks, and if they can't then I honestly don't know how people can be that bad to not be able to understand tactics, there's hundreds of guides for these bosses now as well as some nerfs since Cata's release, if geared players still cannot clear normal modes, then I believe they shouldn't be allowed to.<br />
Also - Firelands is probably about 2 months away, so there's plenty of time for people to clear content.<br />
<br />
If it were accessable. I could grad any 9 other players and do it, and it not be a wipe fest. it's just not that way. they are just not aimed at being accessable. they are twitch gamer focused. as i have stated many tiems before this is a RPG, not a FPS or arcade game it should not take reflexes of any sort to be good at it.<br />
<br />
you should have to think your way to the win. and combat should be turn based.</div></div><hr />

So it seems to me like Blizz know what they are doing.<br />
<br />
Regarding the dungeon finder call to arms, I think the sort of scenario the Daily Blink is portraying can be avoided if a more thorough gear check is made for the tank before they are able to queue as one. That is, if Blizz can design a tool that can make sure a player is wearing gear appropriate for their spec, then we would be all set.</div></div><hr />

Real PVPers wanted the gear available to all for the sake of a level competitive field and PVEers used them as stop-gap gear for when big dragon refused to drop x weapon or whatever. The 5/6 SSC 3/4 TK people were the ones that cheered loudest.<br />
<br />
The whining about catering to casuals only comes from middling players in mediocre guilds. The bleeding edge players are always ahead and doing things that the bottom 95% won't be able to do and what others can do, they've already done it months ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's amazing how Blizzard, or at least these guys currently working on WoW, don't understand gaming at all. It's not about masochism or punishing content, it's about providing an artificial challenge of increasing difficulty. Video games since the beginning have had levels that get increasingly difficult, meaning that to get further and see more you need to improve your skills at the game. Yes if you jump straight to the last level it may seem like punishing and unreasonable, but that's just because you haven't gained the skills necessary to reach that level yet.<br />
<br />
What you are responding to isn't about dumbing down content, it's about making the game more accessible. The person that Blue responded to was QQ'ing about month's long grinding being removed. There is no skill involved in that. As matter of fact, the game play being requested, that Blizzard is moving away from is very similar to how Runescape was designed which is played by hundred's of thousands of 10 year olds.<br />

No, Classic and BC were way harder. It's just harder than WotLK. But now, everythings once more nerfed to the ground.<br />

Arcatraz heroic was very challenging. You felt great after completing it, because not every player could do so easily. Nowadays, it's nothing special to finish a 5 man dungeon. You join a group and after 20 minutes it's clear. <br />

The true challenges in WoW are found in the heroic raids, which, according to you, you don't want to do, so I don't know how else Blizzard can help you. Try out Ascendant Council on heroic mode and tell me that WoW is too easy.<br />

Nooooo how dare blizzard not spend weeks of time working on flight in the ghost lands (adjusting Deathholme, fixing the mountain issues, adding the ZA to the world physically as well as adding all the remaining troll lands that exist in the lore but are left out) so that I can spend 5 minutes afk'd flying over it! Those monsters, I needs to fly over all the starting zones on my end game Toon to show the noobs how awesome I am, its the only reason I play the game!

They use math, thousands of lines of code, programs designed in house to adjust things. Stuff doesn't always sink up.

What SEEMS like something thats easy, just isn't always possible without weeks of work for 25 people, time and money better spent on designing new dungeons/raids, new zones/events thats what the world team does, they could just recycle MC instead of the firelands and have spent more time fixing ghost lands for you... or they could have made the firelands.

<br />
Dumbing down the game has been happening since WotLK because a large part of the players and designers are not gamers. They're people who fuck around Sims or Farmville and who think just paying for the game means they should get a free ride through it. And that's fine if Blizzard actually stated what they're doing up front: &quot;There's a lot more money being made from the Facebook 'gamers' than real gamers so that's who we will develop for.&quot; But they don't have the balls to admit that.<br />
<br />
We've made a lot of progress toward striking that balance and continuing to evolve the game, but it's not something we're ever likely to perfect, and we'll be constantly working to hit that elusive goal.<br />
<br />
Even the designers themselves admit they're not skilled enough to get it right. Do they think their customers want to keep paying monthly to see them &quot;try their hardest&quot;? Fuck no, if you can't get it right then quit and let Blizzard hire people who can get it right - they've had plenty of these people in the past.<br />

No one said you had to make sense. Heroics are meant to gear your character from level 85 regular dungeons to level 85 entry raids. Just as the recycled ZG/ZA are meant to fill in gear for the next raid tier in 4.2.<br />
<br />
What you're asking for has no place.<br />
<br />
edit: and clearing it in blues doesn't change the fact it was balanced for raid geared players (it was after all for the T5 tier attunement) it just means you're wasting time.<br />
<br />
You can do red quests while you're leveling up too. So what? You get a cookie. Now sit back down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Balo</div><div class="date">2011-04-11, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People don't get it. WoW was never planned to be a copy of Everquest, it was always meant to be an accessible MMO and that's why it's such a successful game. At Vanilla it was more alike Everquest because Blizzard knew no better. As more games are made, new ideas come up, WoW will become more and more like the current games. <br />
<br />
People that enjoy gaming masochism only play WoW because it's the most popular MMO that exists, not because they really like the game. They are only following the band wagon. IMO, all those people should quit WoW and go find a game that suits their playstyle better.<br />
<br />
why not you quit and go find a different game</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gpherder</div><div class="date">2011-04-11, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the first &quot;the Daily Blink&quot; that I think is pure bullcrap logic. Granted, there will be people who will try this, but the very idea of doing it will be crushed right when people join the instance. People are already extremely cynical when it comes to players with bad gear, especially when it comes to tanks and healers, so why on earth would that change with this new system? Also, even if the people in the group would accept the badly geared tank, which I very much doubt, do you think the person will be able to stay long after his first wipe, which will be the very first pack of mobs? The system is enough unforgiving for this behaviour to simply die off, while the point of the rewards to get the more skilled people to join the queu will still be there, and will only be available to the person who can do their role well and finish the instance.<br />
<br />
The unfortunate part is, it won't stop the bad tanks from queuing. And what will result is this:<br />
<br />
1) Bad tanks will be kicked until they find a group that has too long of a cooldown timer to kick them - as this idiotic system continues, this will take less and less time due to the number of bad tanks who will need to be kicked. Then they will be carried and rewarded for queuing as tanks - after all, there's no real punishment to being kicked, they can just insta-queue again.<br />
<br />
2) Groups who have just kicked a bad tank will go back in the queue, very possibly for a rinse and repeat - which means the next tank (and possibly a few tanks) after the original bad tank will not help the queue at all, but rather go to replace the kicked tank(s).<br />
<br />
3) Queue times will be close to or exactly the same as we have now.</div></div><hr />

I'm just saying that WoW is currently too easy. Besides raiding there is nothing to do.<br />
<br />
And no, heroics were'nt meant to only gear up. Once in BC Blizzard said something like: &quot;Challenge for experienced players&quot; <br />
Bad players were happy to clear their normal modes. Some good players did heroics way earlier and got rewarded.<br />
The whole thing has changed because some Facebook Farmville players complained and whined too much. And that's my point. WoW is not that much fun anymore (and no, i won't cancel my subscription now) ! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just as the recycled ZG/ZA are meant to fill in gear for the next raid tier in 4.2.<br />

Tanks and Healers have the most important roles in a group as there is only one of each and 3 dps so if one dps goes down you group is still ok but if the healer or tank dies your group will most likely wipe so they DESERVE additional loot.<br />
