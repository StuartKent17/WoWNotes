Today we've got another update to Algalon's Loot Table, but this one is definitely strange. With the recent hotfixes to Ulduar a lot of guilds managed to kill the Iron Council and Hodir in hard mode and two new items were discovered. <br />
<br />
Constellus (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/may/constellus.jpg) (1H-Mace - Spell MP5) dropped from Hodir in Hard Mode.<br />
Fang of Oblivion (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/may/fangofoblivion.jpg) (1H Dagger - Phys.DPS) dropped from the Iron Council in Hard Mode.<br />
<br />
None of these items were discovered on PTRs where the Iron Council and Hodir hard modes were killed by tons of guilds and they weren't part of the official armory update that included all the loot tables from all the bosses (except Algalon). According to their itemID, and if the two item drops mentionned above aren't a bug, we can assume that Algalon will share a part of his loot table with regular bosses. <br />

Hodir Hard Mode US First Kill by VANQUISH<br />
VANQUISH (http://www.vqguild.net/) was the first guild to succesfuly defeat the Hard Mode of Hodir in the US. The Hall of Fame (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=864) has been updated.<br />

WoW Insider interviews Tom Chilton on Patch 3.1 and beyond<br />
WoWInsider (http://www.wowinsider.com/2009/05/05/wow-insider-interviews-tom-chilton-on-3-1-and-beyond/) had a chance to talk with Tom Chilton (Kalgan) about Patch 3.1 and everything we can expect after that.<br />
<br />
The Argent Tournament will be expanded in Patch 3.2 and will be the biggest feature of the patch<br />
A new battleground will be added to the game in Patch 3.2<br />
New dances and druid forms are still in the work<br />
More hero classes are definitely possible in the future but Blizzard is being very careful about them and don't want to go too far too quickly.<br />
Dual-spec is a nice idea but Tri-spec most likely won't happen<br />
Housing is an awesome feature on other MMOs but developers aren't sure if it would be a good thing for WoW in the long run. It might happen in the future but it's definitely not a priority.<br />

This idea does not excite me one bit, they would have so so many current options for raids and they would pick that? They better cover it with silver gold and whatnot and hand it to me on a platter made out of money. Insert more QQ here, and maybe some more here.<br />
<br />
On serious level: I hope it's still something else but this doesn't make it look like my hopes will come true.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing they consider housing to be a massive amount of work for something that doesn't bring much to the game (it even segregates the players, if anything).</div></div><hr />

Boo :( I was just saying in guild chat a couple of nights ago I'd gladly pay 2500g for a third spec, so I could actually have a PvP spec alongside my two PvE ones. As it is, PvP just isn't fun as a mage without resil and with a PvE spec. Not fun enough to grind out the resil gear in the first place to MAKE it fun. And while 2500g would be more expensive than just respecing every time I PvP, I'd only do it if I could buy a third &quot;permanent&quot; spec for the convenience factor. Having to go to the trainer and spend 10 minutes clicking talents makes me not want to bother PvPing in the first place.</div></div><hr />

If you check Constellus on Armory (http://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=45612), you'll see that it clearly says: Algalon the Observer, item coming from Gift of the Observer. And yet it dropped off Hodir for numerous guilds (i.e. Exodus or Forlorn Legacy).</div></div><hr />

Sorry to say this, but there is no reason/way/bleep ever that you can justify not allowing female players in your guild. This is pure discrimination, and, even if that doesn't mean much, makes them lose my respect for them.<br />

The funny part is that you previously raided just fine with 1 PvE dps spec only. Now that you have the chance for a second spec, you'd rather blow it on a &quot;different&quot; PvE dps spec than us it for PvP. Guess you really didn't want to PvP.</div></div><hr />

Typical Ulduar cloth loot = Lots of Stamina (wtf?), lack of intelligence, loads of spirit in dps gear and crit/haste in healing gear, lack of crit/haste in dps gear and regen in healing gear.<br />

I don't speak for my guild, but from personal experience girls have an added chance (over a guy) to be an e-whore and cause drama. I've seen several people quit in different guilds directly relating to a girl. When you can recruit a guy to fill the same role why not do so, it's just a better bet.

Nice, what a way to motivate players to kill him.<br />

Depends on how it's done. Maybe algalon shares only its lower level items with &quot;less harder bosses&quot;, and has exclusive higher level loot (ilvl &gt; 240 ?)</div></div><hr />

Just be content with the guild you're in that accepts women.. There are no strict regulation contract from Blizzard requiring guilds to have women; it's really their business and not yours. What they do with their guild is their problem.. not yours.<br />

This no girl thing is all very interesting. You are walking a thin line as it's grossly illegal in the US to discriminate against a person because of sex in almost every situation. I guess you could claim it is a private club but even those are not safe if there are no equivalent private clubs available for the women to join (see Eastern Star vs Master Masons). You'd have to prove that on your server, there is an equivalent guild that accepts women or you'd be exposed to the Equal Opprotunity clause.<br />
<br />
If somebody wanted to sue you, they probably could (do you really want to tout this and have the ACLU get interested???) They might not win, but you'd be out alot of money in legal fees.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying here is any guild with this policy is exposing themselves to a lawsuit for really a childish reason. You can discriminate against a person for being a &quot;E-whore&quot; and be fine with it. There are plenty of quality female gamers out there you could run with who would not cause you the drama and would keep you out of the legal bullseye.<br />
<br />

The amusing part is, the problem in the situation you describe isnt the woman - it's the guys who for whatever reason, never learned how to control themselves in the presence of one. I'd say the internet white knights who hold their princesses up on a pedestal are just as much, if not more of a problem than the e-whore's themselves. E-whores and drama queens only cause problems if you enable them. Ignore them just like you'd ignore any male drama queen, and they go away. Its quite telling that for whatever reason, you feel male and female drama should be handled differently, and people evidently lack the self control to simply ignore, reprimand, or gkick a female player who is behaving like an asshat just as you would a man. Its all in how *you* choose to handle it. They aren't a special case unless you make them one. <br />
<br />
Of course, the fact that you've seemingly never played with a normal woman who actually plays to play the game, not garner attention.. really just speaks to the type of people you attract and/or choose to surround yourself with.</div></div><hr />

And it would be even more ridiculous if they truly believed it helped em progress faster or prevent drama.<br />
The amount of female players in 'world top' guilds is quite a bit higher than in the average raiding guild. And they &quot;in my personal experience&quot; never ever had more drama issues with them than they had with male players.<br />
<br />
Just make sure your guild ain't full with basement nerds that get a tent in their pants when they even dare to imagine talking to a woman over the internet. EU guilds don't have issues with it, so I don't see why US guilds would have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Pretty sure we didn't go around claiming we were the best. We killed the boss in I think 2 maybe 3 attempts, we know it's nerfed.<br />
<br />
For all the responses to the &quot;No girls&quot; thing.... I'm not our recruiting officer or any officer for that matter, but I'm pretty sure it's not a published RULE (since we've had a few girls in over the year that I've been in VQ), but we don't accept girls. Having a preference in a video game guild or &quot;team&quot; isn't against any law. The WOW agreements I'm pretty sure don't state what restrictions we're allowed to have and not have. World of Warcraft is it's own World with it's own rules, recruiting only people with dick and balls by choice isn't against any rule.<br />
<br />
I never said it was ALWAYS the girls fault. Case in point it's usually not entirely the girls fault. Weak minded people coupled with a girl not understanding they are getting too close to someone or spending too much time around someone (who might get the wrong idea) is the usual problem, that I've seen. That and girls love to play show and tell with pictures etc. When I said it's less risk I meant unless you have an abundance of internet queers that specific risk won't be there, where with girls the risk (however small) exists. Guy = less chance of drama MOST LIKELY.<br />

It's as offensive as saying &quot;We choose to prefer not having black people in the guild cause they cause wipes more often.&quot; As in A) You're picking out a random demographic category of people and B) you give biased, based-on-nothing arguments as to why you do so.<br />

Sorry to say this, but there is no reason/way/bleep ever that you can justify not allowing female players in your guild. This is pure discrimination, and, even if that doesn't mean much, makes them lose my respect for them.<br />
<br />
Yeah bro<br />
<br />
<br />
The only guilds that deny female players, are guilds that can't contain themselves around female players (ie: 14 year olds, or people who have very minimal contact with females in general).<br />
<br />
I'm serious. I'm sure there are female players that play the &quot;e-slut&quot; role very well, and maybe they've experienced it one too many times... but more often then not, drama surrounding female players is because some overzealous male virgin got too excited and tried to take things too far and created the drama to begin with. <br />
<br />
Then again, I don't have respect for these people anyway. Sitting on your ass, and neglecting everything for some false sense of entitlement via a video game is downright pathetic. They are social rejects and will be for the rest of their lives. But hey, in 10 years they can look back and say &quot;lol we got world first hard mode Hodir /flex&quot;. rofl.<br />

This guy seems to be the first person to get what I mean entirely. We have new recruits, we have members that have been here for a short time, and some a long time. Who knows how people will react or what would happen if we did recruit an actual &quot;e-whore&quot;. As I've said I personally did not make this rule, but I've personally seen why it could be useful. Girl joins guild, people adore her. Others get jealous or tease girl and people who spend a lot of time with said girl. People act stupidly etc. drama occurs, something bad COULD occur. <br />
<br />
The best way I can explain it I have. It is simply (in my own understanding) a prevention of any EXTRA risk that we can easily avoid entirely. Am I saying someone or some group of players in my guild are weak, no not that I know of, but there could be...<br />
<br />
Again VK, please explain where in the world it says we are required to be &quot;justified&quot; in who we recruit. There is no written code of ethics or guideline for who to recruit. You mentioned black people... Why is this even an example. Do you have some stereotype or discrimination against black gamers? Does this example hold any weight? Girls have the possibility of risk, again a lot won't, but why even chance the risk if you've seen personally what it can do.<br />
<br />
If your a girl I'd be mad, it's not fair not at all. I 100% agree your at the shit end of the stick, but this is a game and much like life it's not always fair.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">anyaka21</div><div class="date">2009-05-06, 09:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The funny part is that you previously raided just fine with 1 PvE dps spec only. Now that you have the chance for a second spec, you'd rather blow it on a &quot;different&quot; PvE dps spec than us it for PvP. Guess you really didn't want to PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
I honestly doubt it's that. If I had to guess, most people probably still respec for pvp, especially amongst a lot of prominent classes.<br />
<br />
As it stands for most raiders, speccing for 10 and 25's can be vastly different, more of a dps spec vs more mana regen, for example. Arcane or Fire spec for mages. Healers classes pretty much needing off spec dps instead of pvp.<br />
<br />
Thus a 3rd spec would be nice to have as a pvp spec.<br />
<br />
One thing that can be done with this though, to optimize, and granted I'm not sure of the coding involimagine it would be hard. But have that 3rd spec for pvp only. Thus that gives the game a lot of options in terms of how talents work, and which ones could be seriously tweaked for pvp. There could also be gear that is only usable in said pvp spec. <br />
<br />
It's a further twist on game mechanics, but it could change the nature of pvp and add that it could possibly help class balance.</div></div><hr />

However, I'd like to address this Gender Issue.<br />
<br />
Firstly to all of those who don't like girls in there guild.<br />
<br />
To begin with, How can you know for sure they are female? I realize that you could easily invite them into your guild without knowing, hear them on vent and in all probability distinguish that they are female. Would you /gkick them then?<br />
In World of Warcraft what makes girls so different from boys. [women, men]<br />
Who are you to say that ALL girls are &quot;dramatic&quot; ect.<br />
It is important while growing up that people shed this secular shell and emerge themselves in a world, which is reality, in which they see that all people are capable of the same heights, all people are capable of the same lows, and in the end Gender has no value, nor does colour or culture.<br />
You group both men and women into groups which- to you- seem to describe the way most act in social or domestic scenarios. Any situation. What is it that makes you think its okay? Its a completely false argument. Who are you to judge what all women do or not do? Grouping people based off a singular organ is necessary for many things, yet on an online game? This shovanistic display is not even childish, for children remain strongly unbiased throughout childhood [however this varies], lack of maturity? Inherited merit? I understand this superiority complex and how easy it is for it to consume oneself, but in this fashion? It's astounding that in an online GAME where you cannot physically see who your communicating with that it would matter if it were a female or not. Perhaps in a sport your argument, however still frowned upon, could be given much more credit. But being a male of female, even if you come up with some hormonal excuse, gender does not effect play style, skill, focus, nothing! Gender collectively effects nothing. What you are doing is prosecuting a whole entire group of people, based off the actions of individuals. If you can rationally justify this in anyway, please attempt to. I would love to read your fumbling, loose, arguments which have no direction. <br />
Lastly, who's to say there aren't women in you guild now? It's not as if you've met every person in person, voices are sometimes indistinguishable. Alas. I must mention, I'm a guy- and being that, I say mature, become more flexible, because the longer you hold such hubris thoughts over women, the you'll notice them triumphing over you. That's it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is precisely the problem here, yes.<br />
<br />
VANQUISH appears to be aware that they've got some members that wouldn't be able to keep their heads on their shoulders (or their wangs in their pants), so they've instituted the rule to keep them focused. Sexist? Perhaps, if you look at it from a social construction point of view, in that these males have been conditioned and raised to not be able to keep things level headed around a female in a video game. Logical? Most definitely. They can't trust their raid members to keep things proper, so they instituted a system of control to make SURE things stay proper.<br />
<br />
Yeah, it's unfair to females that want to join a great guild, but thankfully, there are many other guilds that have no such restriction. Vanq is allowed to put this policy into place.</div></div><hr />

Really the issue should be taken head on! In fact in situations similar to this one, girls in the guild would be the best thing! It would establish and create a foundation for communication with women, that they- obviously lack. Despite this all, I really think it's a bunch of crap. Self control and maturity are two things that every person needs to establish- These Guilds policies remind me somewhat of Hasidic Judaism, where men and women are always kept separate due to the ideas that women would distract men from there praying and religious study. Another close example is veiling up to the 19th century [in most middle east and east Europe Muslim countries]. Ataturk, Turkeys &quot;beloved&quot; reformer actually made veiling illegal in an attempt to further westernize and modernize Turkey :)<br />
Really techniques like veiling, foot binding, and corsets of the 17th 18th and 19th centuries really exemplify male dominance and control. However I don't find that these players are trying to control the women around them, but limit there contact from women because of there social inadequacies. Why would you want players so easily distracted and mislead? And for what are they mislead by?<br />
Ah, Okay rants over, maybe I nailed it this time?</div></div><hr />

It sucks, it's chauvanistic, it's barbaric, it's dark ages, hasidic judaism, etc... But that's their guild.<br />
<br />
I don't personally agree, but I can respect their guild for downing content and doing what they need to do to stay focused. It's probably different for every guild and what each needs to stay focused. This is just one way, no distractions. <br />
<br />
Personally, I like variety, and having a little fun. Thus I may not be world first, or sometimes even server first, but always close.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But yeah you do have a point.<br />
I guess things are just relative to that experiencing it.<br />
I don't agree but they do have my respect for downing the content also-<br />
You do what you need to do to get by,<br />
Hopefully in the future people won't give such a negative personification of there<br />
guild, and despite me saying this, I do hold fast to all I said~<br />
Ah revelation within revelation!<br />
In the end the message I'm trying to get out is be mindful of<br />
the people you interact with- People get offended and such.<br />
If they do, they usually want an explanation- previous explanations<br />
were crap, so I thought I could draw some of them out and get there<br />
say- I guess not, maybe still, oh well. Good Talk, hopefully we can<br />
get a say in from a Guild with similar policies!</div></div><hr />

Looks like we have an explanation:<br />
<br />
We made a hotfix yesterday to several hard mode loot tables in order to spread around Algalon's weapon drops to make the items more accessible. Algalon still has loot that is unique to him, but the acquisition of the weapons in Ulduar won't be so soul crushingly difficult and ultimately unfair to certain class/builds.<br />

You are walking a thin line as it's grossly illegal in the US to discriminate against a person because of sex in almost every situation. I guess you could claim it is a private club but even those are not safe if there are no equivalent private clubs available for the women to join (see Eastern Star vs Master Masons). You'd have to prove that on your server, there is an equivalent guild that accepts women or you'd be exposed to the Equal Opprotunity clause.<br />

If somebody wanted to sue you, they probably could (do you really want to tout this and have the ACLU get interested???) They might not win, but you'd be out alot of money in legal fees.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying here is any guild with this policy is exposing themselves to a lawsuit for really a childish reason. You can discriminate against a person for being a &quot;E-whore&quot; and be fine with it. There are plenty of quality female gamers out there you could run with who would not cause you the drama and would keep you out of the legal bullseye.<br />

Hi. The world doesn't revolve around the US. WoW servers accept an international crowd. The US government has no control over Canadian players, Mexican players, Latin American, Austrlian, or any people in the rest of the world. Nor does the government care about a WoW guild.</div></div><hr />

If the guild in question, say, were not a bunch of basement nerds who fight over pixel chicks, but rather some White Supremists who would instantly /gquit if a black gamer joined the guild. To safeguard the stability of the guild, I'm sure their GM would implement a &quot;no blacks&quot; policy with recruitment. No doubt this would cause an uproar but hey, how's this any different to blocking out people with slow reaction skills (i.e. the 'downies'), undergeared for one reason or another (the 'scrubs'), and certain over-numbered classes (paladins and DKs)? At the end of the day, their recruitment policy is to protect their core raider. Sure, you can say they're ignorant assholes/losers, but their goal is to defeat end-game content, not running for presidential candidate.</div></div><hr />

Really the issue should be taken head on! In fact in situations similar to this one, girls in the guild would be the best thing! It would establish and create a foundation for communication with women, that they- obviously lack. Despite this all, I really think it's a bunch of crap. Self control and maturity are two things that every person needs to establish- These Guilds policies remind me somewhat of Hasidic Judaism, where men and women are always kept separate due to the ideas that women would distract men from there praying and religious study. Another close example is veiling up to the 19th century [in most middle east and east Europe Muslim countries]. Ataturk, Turkeys &quot;beloved&quot; reformer actually made veiling illegal in an attempt to further westernize and modernize Turkey :)<br />

As rarely as I bother to play grammar police online(omg if I said Nazi that would be borderline grounds for a lawsuit), I do find it completely laughable that in the same post in which you attempt to show off your worldly education and provide a historical and sociological perspective to show how our guild policy is wildly inappropriate you also fail at using the proper form of the word &quot;their&quot;. (i.e. that is their guild policy vs. there is no way I could have made a bigger fool of myself).<br />
As for the comment about our policy exposing ourselves to a lawsuit? While I completely agree that the degree of ludicrous and frivolous lawsuits are rising at an exponential rate in the US, the mere fact that you actually believe this idiocy is a sign that you need to re-evaluate the entire point of a video game. It is an escape from the drudgery of everyday life. The point is to be able to turn your mind off from conference calls, sales reports, etc. If I wanted to act like a responsible mature adult I'd be putting in overtime at the office, not slaying e-monsters. But please, go ahead and report me to the HR department... oh wait.<br />
To the people who think that we somehow put up a sign that says &quot;No Girls Allowed&quot; out of the blue, or do it for attention... It's very simple: We've had drama in the past with girls, we readily admit that there are immature guys in our guild that can't be trusted around any cutey patootey girls. We've also never talked with any girls IRL. At the end of the day, it's our $15 a month and our decision, right or wrong, that the potential benefits of finding an amazing female raider are outweighed by the probability of finding a *good* female raider that also ends up causing drama. Plenty of other guilds out there, both casual and hardcore, that are more than happy to take an extra infusion of estrogen, we just don't happen to be one of them. Consider it a favor that you're not paying $25 to server transfer only to get removed a month later to maintain guild stability...</div></div><hr />

In Original we had Zul'Gurub and in BC there was Zul'Aman... why not have another troll raid wit Gundrak?<br />
Alson what I think would have been really cool was instead of two 5-mans for Azjol-Nerub why couldn't you just make an awesome raid out of it.<br />
Original WoW and TBC had 6 multi-boss raids (multi-boss as in not full-length raids, which I'm pretty sure every Original was except Onyxia and UBRS but some of the TBC ones were not from my understanding [joined WoW just before WotLK]).... why not put at least IF NOT MORE into WotLK.</div></div><hr />

The simple fact is, the officers know that most of their members are nerds who couldn't handle women, proving the negative gamer stereotypes true. Vanquish needs this rule. Their members wouldn't function otherwise, once estrogen comes in.<br />
<br />
It is sad, sure. But well, Vanquish has to work with the people they have. While it is unfortunate that those are people who could not function well in real life, they work well enough in the game for Vanquish to do something.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is actually good for us women that this policy is in effect. Nothing is more annoying than playing with such pathetic losers. This way, we see what kind of players this guild has, and can go for guilds with more mature players, like the many guilds like that in europe that actually reek in world firsts.<br />
<br />
We all win this way. Female players for finding guilds without such a high loser ratio, and Vanquish for actually being able to play without drama.</div></div><hr />

What is there to try and explain? What needs an explanation? Would you all prefer women getting accepted and then treated differently in the guild? If that's the way you want it... you can implement it in your own guild.<br />
<br />
There are multitudes of guilds that don't allow players under the age of 18, for reasons ranking anywhere from immaturity to bedtimes, but there are exceptions that can make great raiders and there are exceptions to the stereotype that women are bad at games and that they all cause drama. It is ultimately up to the guild to make their rules. Period. Doesn't involve the public or the government or guidelines, nothing. They don't need to answer to anyone, and its upsetting to me that people are caring enough to call them names and insult their skill or maturity. <br />
<br />
Maybe someone who hates the sound of accents will start a guild and won't accept anyone unless they sound just like him. Chances are... he won't have many people in his guild and he won't go very far. But let's see how many forums threads get started about his guild.<br />

Hormones are theire for a reason. Everyone knows when a man hears a soft voice of a girl / women. His e-peen goes WOOPOOPOOOPOOPOOO. Only some people have the descency to talk like a normal guy.<br />
In our guild we have 6 girls from whom 6 actually are in our raiding group (casual raiding guild , lots of fun blabla). And actually we're all doing just fine anyway. Think they have the best listening to tactics then anyone else. Even needed to explain tactics to a newly joined healer (female) and actually she was kind and all the rest on ventrilo kept being social with her.<br />

<br />
<br />
Or we can avoid the whole &quot;I PLAY WORLD OF WARCRAFT FOR THE SOCIAL ASPECT&quot; that 99% of most female gamers have and end up sending tells to veteran members that consist of &quot;I want to feel you inside of me&quot; because they feel like their place in our guild is more secure when they have their thick, child-bearing hips strapped around the face of someone who's important to our roster. Not only that, most (not all) of the females we've ever recruited are absolutely retarded and suck at this game in every way/shape/form. <br />
<br />
We've recruited girls in the past and have seen two who are legitimately good players. Coincidently, they still brought drama to our guild by doing pretty much everything I mentioned in the above paragraph. <br />
<br />
It's not worth the drama and I will never recruit another female into VQ. Besides, how can girls find time to play games when they need to spend all their free time cooking or doing laundry? <br />
