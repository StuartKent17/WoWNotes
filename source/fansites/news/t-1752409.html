<br />
WoW Token Releases April 7 in the US - $20 or 30k Gold<br />
The WoW Token (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122270-wow-token) is finally here this week!<br />
<br />
<br />
You can purchase the WoW Token (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122270-wow-token) with gold without an active Subscription (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/april/wowTokenInactive.jpg).<br />
The gold price for tokens is set by Blizzard based on supply and demand, not by players.<br />
Purchasing a WoW Token (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122270-wow-token) from the AH makes it Soulbound - it cannot be resold.<br />
The Token grants 30 days of game time.<br />
You can only buy 10 Tokens each month.<br />
Tokens listings are region wide and are not limited to just your realm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update: The WoW Token will be going live in the Americas region (North America, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand) on April 7 when maintenance concludes, at approximately 10 a.m. PDT. The WoW Token will be available for $20 USD/$25 AUD from the in-game Shop, and will be set at a starting price of 30,000 gold in the Auction House across the Americas region. From that point forward, the gold price will automatically fluctuate based on player supply and demand. To start we’ll be limiting the number of Token purchases to 10 within a 30-day period, but this limit may be adjusted over time. While Tokens will be available immediately from the Shop, please note that there may be a delay before Tokens put up for sale on the Auction House become available for purchase with gold.<br />

We’ll announce additional regional details closer to the launch of the WoW Token in other regions.<br />

I might be buying half a year supply if i can get them for 30k/each at launch, with gold being stupidly easy to get.</div></div><hr />

They have already stated you will be able to purchase it without an active subscription.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure they said that you'd be able to buy from the login screen. Not sure how exactly it will work though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FroggyChaos</div><div class="date">2015-04-06, 05:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Oriong they have a system in place to do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can buy with gold even if your subscription is inactive if you try to login it will give you a prompt to buy with gold (if you have enough gold).</div></div><hr />

Actually, the plan is that you can buy a month from the login screen (since you can now play under starter-edition restrictions with a lapsed sub) that will subtract the sum from all your characters combined.</div></div><hr />

If it goes any higher then people will continue buying gamecards off trade for 30k or less as they've been doing.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone has the ability to work the AH to that extent. For you it is easy to do, for others...they may not have the time or ability to do this so easily. <br />
<br />
So it who knows what the market value will end up being due to supply and demand.</div></div><hr />

30k is not that much even if you don't play the auction house. Should be easy enough to get that amount in 1 month.</div></div><hr />

most gold farmers sell gold at roughly this price.. depending on quantity it can go to $1/1k to $1/2k.<br />
Having a reputable, safe and terms of service acceptable method of buying gold.. I am curious as to what the gold farmers are going to do.<br />
I may be able to pay for my subscription through garrison treasure hunting!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get this argument at all, honestly. This is pretty much the going rate at most gold seller sites, so I assume people buy gold exactly for that amount.<br />
<br />
A better argument would be the follwoing consideration: On the one hand, a lot of people that never bought gold might do it from now on, because it's supported and legal. On the other hand, A LOT OF people will be willing to give away gold for gametime, now that it's supported and legal. Will be interesting to see which way the price goes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bodom</div><div class="date">2015-04-06, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember that even the wealthiest gold millionaires will only need one token per month, while the people with families and fulltime jobs would probably prefer to buy a few tokens to save themselves some garrison chores or gold farming each month. If anything I think it'll drop even lower.<br />
<br />
Edit: <br />
<br />
Oh and there are still lots of people out there claiming they never had more than *insert super low amount* of gold and that they don't know how other people are earning that much. Trade last night: &quot;i never had more than 10k gold....&quot;</div></div><hr />

But what you aren't considering is the gold selling sites will undercut in response to current prices, and the people who are interested in buying gold.... let's be honest, they weren't just waiting this whole time for a legal way to do it, they have been all along.</div></div><hr />

However they all offer bulk discounts. I think it is a decent starting price since it is effectively slightly more expensive to buy in bulk than illegal gold is. Of course the supply and demand dynamics for the token will be quite different than for illegal gold (a lot more people on both sides will be willing to trade). Still if the price stays here or drops this will force gold sellers to sell at a much lower price (they already will have to offer significant discounts immediately cause noone will buy from them at current prices when a legal option is available) and if that cuts down their profit margins they will shut down (which will increase demand for tokens and drive token exchange rates even further down).</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I was quoting rates for the most populate servers in US (Illidan, Stormrage, Tichondrius, Darkspear, always on the faction side that is more populous since both Stormrage and Illidan are horribly imbalanced)</div></div><hr />

Out of Curiosity I looked it up this morning on that (in)famous MMO gaming currency company, 30k gold was 21.19 on my realm in the us. SLightly cheaper on Tichondrius US horde(supposedly our highest pop realm), at about $20.</div></div><hr />

Or, you know, wanting to spend multiple hours of a week dedicated to paying your wow sub as opposed to working for 1 hour and paying your wow sub. One of those seems like a much more efficient time investment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I take your first point, this will definitely be interesting to see.<br />
<br />
Not so sure about your second point, though. We are all wildly speculating at this point, but I would guess that there are quite a few people who will buy gold for the very first time through this system. Security matters, the point of it no longer regarded as cheating and officially supported matters. We'll see. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
You have no idea how much gold is sleeping...<br />
<br />
I just calculated it quickly for myself and came to the conclusion that I could, theoretically, purchase about 400 months of game time for that starting price.<br />
But the point is, I don't really need that many, do I?<br />
<br />
So yeah, there's a huge amount of gold just laying around. But all things considered, nobody will need more than one token per account per month in the long run.</div></div><hr />

There's no point &quot;hoarding&quot; them. They become soulbound upon purchase from the exhange. If they wanna spend their in-game millions on game time, power to them, but they can't use their bank to affect the economy in any fashion other than creating demand and raising the economy price.</div></div><hr />

I spend most of my gold on raiding. I never really desperate for gold, but it does mean I can't drop 100k on an item unless I make a big effort to save. Luckily this expansion the cash I made matched the cash I needed. I make gold usually as a side effect of playing, without trying much. I'd rather be murdering orcs and seeing content than managing my investments :)<br />
<br />
So for me, buying in game gold with real life money isn't something that's very tempting. It also feels like a bit of a slippery slope - one I don't want to start walking down.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I could probably spend a few hours a month and buy my game time, at 30k anyway. That's right on the edge of being worth it for me, just to be able to say, I play this game for free (basically).<br />
<br />

<br />
As a raider, I can clear 30k a month easily, so I'm fairly happy with that price. As a raider obsessed with expensive mounts, I wish it returned slightly more. I can afford a bit more of a gold price, whereas dropping another $20 to get the amount of gold I need for X purchase is something I would hesitate to do.</div></div><hr />

It's to make it so buying tokens isn't an alternate subscription option. If you're buying a token, you should want to be selling it for gold. If you want to buy gametime, you should be spending gold to do it, or buy an actual game card.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The idea is that someone buys a Token not to use for themselves, but for someone else to pay gold to use the time token. The extra $5 is so Blizzard can have a little profit due to the amount of people they are planning on using this as a way to fuel their wow time instead of buying cards/monthly fee.<br />

I'm a scrooge with money, as long as it stays around the 30k mark and doesn't go to some insane price like 200k/token, my interest will stay piqued.</div></div><hr />

And I can tell you that people expecting the gold price to rise don't have a single clue about economics. Price willll first take a dive as the offer will rise a lot (from 0 to X thousands). Then slowly rise again when people will start buying some months.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2015-04-06, 06:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">30K gold for $20? I made 2k gold sending out a few followers yesterday, and that was from one Blingtron mission, and then another 17k gold from a BRF BOE. Based on how easy it is to get gold this expac, seems like the value is low imo.<br />
<br />
It's 46 days since I last got a blingtron mission for one of my alts. RNG is RNG. You can easily get 7k for a couple of hours every week(per character) doing cata 25hc raids. If you can generate 30k a month passively then that is great. If you have to &quot;work&quot; to collect it, that's just plain and simple work. Personally I don't feel like &quot;working&quot;(in game) to pay for wow. I have a large buffer of money saved up, which I'm sure many others do. Anyways, 30k seem a bit higher than I expected but we'll see how it turns out. The first few months are going to be crazy, it'll take more time before things finally settle down. In time I'm certain the prices will drop tho, they *always* do with things like this. WoW isn't the first mmo who pulled something like this off.<br />
<br />
I really like that they made them bind on pickup or whatever they called it. That stops people from buying them to resell them. We'll see how that goes tho since in other games it doesn't exactly work like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just in time for Q! sub numbers to plummet this should be interesting, are they counted as a sub when used or when purchased?<br />
<br />
It's a sub since someone actually paid $20(which is $5 more than a normal). Basically a game time card, 30 days whatever. It's hard to predict how things turn out, would have to wait half a year or so to see the results, up until that point it's just speculations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That means that Blizz is making ~$5 bucks a transaction to pay for the development costs associated with the feature, maintenance of the feature, and then profit. Seems fairly reasonable. They are selling the ability for you to pay someone else gold for a month of game time and they charge the other person (the one paying real money) $5 to act as a legitimate middle-man.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, 30k gold is too much for the ones already buying with 3rd parties, Sure people will buy them no doubt, but i expect the price to go lower after the ones buying the token for gold add in.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, 30k gold is too much for the ones already buying with 3rd parties, Sure people will buy them no doubt, but i expect the price to go lower after the ones buying the token for gold add in.<br />
Can only hope they do get cheaper. <br />

I can see people buying the tokens on the AH.

They'll go up / down in price when Blizzard wants them to, not based on the number of buyers / sellers (More likely based on the price on illegal sites)<br />

Not according to Blizzard. They specifically said after the initial set point of 30k-gold/$20 that the price changes based on market demand, not constant manipulation by the man.</div></div><hr />

For you it is easy to do, for others...they may not have the time or ability to do this so easily. <br />
<br />
So it who knows what the market value will end up being due to supply and demand.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically we're talking about 1k/day to pay for your wow time. This can be easily done with just the garrison and some minor auctioning. Lets say you have 3 level 100 toons all with max level garrisons, followers for relevant buildings, a trading post at each, a mine and garden at each, an inn, and two profession buildings.<br />
<br />
The mine produces on average 55 true iron, 25 black iron, and 40 stone. Right now ore is worth anywhere from 1-2g each depending on day of the week and time of day on my server, so we'll call it 1.5g. That's 360g/day with 3 mines. The herb garden has 15 nodes which produce 2-8 herb each, we'll call that 4 herbs. On my server herbs with the exception of frostweed sells for 1g each. That's 240g/day with 3 gardens. We're up to 600g/day already.<br />
<br />
That leaves us 400g/day from gold missions at the inn which 1 toon, let alone 3 can do. Or 400g/day from mine/herb work orders or goren/podlings. Or 400g/day from crafting at those 2 profession buildings. Or 400g/day from spending GR at the trading post. Draenic dust sells from 6-9g/each on my server. Spending 800 garrison resources alone once a week will net you an easy 1200g from one stack of dust alone.<br />
<br />
None of the auctioning above requires a lot of time. Maybe 10m per toon in the garrison and another 5 once a day in the AH. No need to post/cancel/repost over and over, just post and forget or sell in trade.</div></div><hr />

It's about mid-way through the page, of that interview with a Blizzard dev. Search for &quot;Black market&quot; to find it.<br />

Presumably they'll be looking at doing that more next tier, since there isn't really much 'win' you can achieve by paying right now. I'd expect to see no mythic BoEs and no mythic items on the BMAH -- perhaps replaced with heroic versions or just dropped altogether.</div></div><hr />

That is the market price for ILLEGALLY bought gold, so it is different. <br />

All in all i think that it is a fair price. Sure you can still buy time codes (which requires a reliable source and leaves you open to scams if you have never done it before) and pay 20k as opposed to 30k, but really, what is 30k these days in WoW.

Won't happen cause they earn it through selling gold. So it's as i said... Only few tokens on The Ah equals high prizes. So be lucky and grab some before they're gone :)</div></div><hr />

What, the 90 boost? Because 1-90 is sooo relevant for anyone anymore. Majority of players have done it so many times now that it's a chore an no longer fun. Now you think time tokens are also a pay to skip system? God are you wrong. We don't want you here anyway, stay gone.</div></div><hr />

Talk for yourself. Don't try to act you are talking on behalf of every WOW player when you say &quot;we&quot;. <br />
<br />
Lets see how it goes. Blizzard thought they had a great system with D3. It made them money - and got rid of the &quot;bad guys&quot; but the &quot;chore&quot; was to actually play the game. Then the game is not really worth playing anymore. <br />
<br />
Best system for a game is to create good solid content that is about the game and the fun part in it. When you start to leave in content that players pay to skip for - on top subscription and pay for the game and the expansions, then you have ruined what ppl are paying for in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Are you really suggesting that you think the price will be 3k in 2 weeks time? (Just checking I am not misunderstanding you).<br />
<br />
You know people can get 4k gold from 1 follower mission right? (Mythic Box With 1000g + 3 Treasure Hunters).<br />
<br />
I get more than 3k a week just from salvage.<br />

The tokens are for people who want to make gold, not use them themselves for game time. The extra $5 is more than likely to help even out the costs of the people who will start paying for time with gold instead of real money to sub.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so initial price to be 30k all the rich players will right away go get their 10 tokens as they know many people will buy the token at start and prices initially will go up so why wait? suddenly demand peaked. gold price went up, so people who maybe thought about buying a token to make some gold for the mount they always wanted or whatever see the rising price of tokens and may consider its the time! they also may know the initial price will go up due to peak of demand and they may never have a second chance to make the same big amount of gold per token. and it will all go up until the bubble burst and imho it will happen around 50-60k gold mark, maybe even 70k.. <br />

<br />
That's not true. You'd have to pay somewhere around $24 for 30k. Give it a few months, then you'll have the proper prices. It's impossible to predict what will happen. Generally speaking prices do drop and for now the prices seem to be around what &quot;other&quot; sources are charging for it. My point is after x amount of months, most people will already have all the tokens they want. People quit playing the game and so on. It's not like what Blizzard is doing right now is the first time it has happened. Other mmos have similar systems and prices *always* drop and settle - however in the first few months prices are probably going to rise due to the demand, but once that settles down, it'll be harder and harder to sell the tokens over their value. Like I said, it's just speculations, the tokens could go for 1 million gold each in 3 months and I'm sure there would be players buying them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's about mid-way through the page, of that interview with a Blizzard dev. Search for &quot;Black market&quot; to find it.<br />
<br />
Presumably they'll be looking at doing that more next tier, since there isn't really much 'win' you can achieve by paying right now. I'd expect to see no mythic BoEs and no mythic items on the BMAH -- perhaps replaced with heroic versions or just dropped altogether.<br />
<br />
&quot;“Because we ban them very regularly and very frequently, they’re not typically farming items or creating items they can sell, because they’ll typically be banned before those items can be sold,” he said. “They have a short life expectancy. The hope is that their life becomes harder.” I had a good laugh reading the first sentence. I've added several bots to my friend list to keep track of them and how &quot;regularly&quot; they ban said bots. All of the names on my bot list are still active and playing. The most hilarious part is they stay in one spot and farm, who knows how long, they're up when I log on and they're still up when I log off. I'd say 10-12+ hours a day just farming. The names on my list are closing in one 4 months and yes, they're still active. It would seem, from previous experiences with earlier expansions that the ban rate is somewhere around 3-6 months. Them using the words &quot;very regularly and very frequently&quot; is just complete bs.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; Noticed them talking about the guardian cub. The only thing I'd like to see blizzard do is have *all* store content BoE. 30 days free time, whatever, really. I've spent $15 a month for such a long time now and it's nothing. Even if WoW was free I'd only play it for a few months or so until I got bored with it. It's not like WoW is the best game ever, you'll have some fun with your friends then you move on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is supply and demand, Blizzard just sets the prices based on an algorithm that figures out how fast they're selling out. If they just did it entirely free market you'd have people who see a bunch going for 30K and buy one and by the time they got to put it on the AH they were now going for 10K because it's payday and the market just got flooded by two million people undercutting each other. They specifically designed the system so people weren't gambling with their money. The price is set for however much time and if you buy during that time that is what you get.<br />
<br />
Also there is nothing at all even loosely related to communism in what you described.</div></div><hr />

What about gold sellers using stolen credit cards to buy wow tokens and get gold for free? They already do it with mounts in blizzard store. But they have to spend time and effort spamming people or trade chat to sell them. Now with the tokens blizzard handles it for free. easy market flood.<br />
In before people start losing game time from their accounts cause the token they bought were through a stolen credit card that got charged back.</div></div><hr />

I won't be surprised to see these tokens get pricier for those with the gold very quickly. When people want to part with a commodity, the quantity escalates and the value of the commodity cheapens. Sort of like a rice; if there's a poor harvest then the price goes up, but when there's bountiful harvest the price decreases. There is no scarcity of gold, there's an abundance. Those who buy gold the first week may be disappointed later.</div></div><hr />

You clearly do not understand the system at all.<br />
<br />
There is no bidding on the Tokens at all.<br />

&quot;The gold price for tokens is set by Blizzard based on supply and demand, not by players.&quot;<br />
<br />
thats not fucking supply &amp; demand - thats communism - and artificial way to drain gold from market -_-<br />
<br />
No, you clearly don't understand.<br />
<br />
Blizzard sets the intial price, they then let the computers take over. The price auto adjusts due to the supply and demand of the product.<br />
<br />
They are just saying that players can't enter the price themselves.</div></div><hr />

that's exactly what it means ... assuming there's enough tokens listed. starting price means price is gonna change in intervals depending on supply/demand. but during this first 'interval' you can sure as hell buy for 30k a pop</div></div><hr />

1 i don`t think it`s anyway against botters\sites that sell gold-they will sell gold just cheaper.<br />
2 i think it just afflect users that don`t even buy gold cos someday blizz say that it`s &quot;illigal&quot; lol yeah illigal show me at what Us low it`s illigal?aha<br />
3 blizz just want to be directly on gold market to make prices<br />
4 yeah all about money if someone don`t know- blizz have taxes from botters(yeah when they bann 1 acc botter will buy 2nd acc and pay direclty to blizz 5-10-20$ depends on botter skills) so blizz already have their gold sells in that way_ just with taxes.here be same.but for all market so we will see 2 markets of gold and both controlled with prices over tokens buy blizz<br />
and all gold in game between seller(botter that sell for $ or player that sell for token)and buyer be controlled by blizz<br />
so just economy.just market capitalism and money.nothing more</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it very well could be that there simply are not any to buy during the first interval. I don´t think very many people are going to spend $20 for 30k. It may turn out that they sell out very fast, and it won´t be until Blizzard updates the prices ( to a higher price) that more people spend real money to buy tokens.<br />
<br />
And that will lead to two questions. First off, is Blizzard REALLY doing these things 1v1? Does someone really have to buy a token for real money before someone can buy it from the AH... if so, I really think we are going to have a situation where people are refreshing the AH constantly waiting for one to show up. And second, How quickly, and how wildly will Blizzard let the prices swing? If these things sell out quickly, how quickly will Blizzard update the price on the cash-shop to entice more people to spend real money, and if these things are selling out 1 second after showing up on the AH, will Blizzard allow the price to skyrocket the first few days, or will it only gradually increase.<br />
<br />
My personal guess is that tomorrow there are going to be a ton of disappointed buyers who find out that the tokens are not showing up because they are being bought instantly.</div></div><hr />

that's what I'm curious about too ... it's super easy for them to 'fix' things - put in more tokens or take some out of the circulation - especially since they already pay the difference (you always get the amount of gold promised when you list the auction even if price changes after ie even if it's 1 : 1 the buyer of your token might pay less)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is that it is not directly 1v1, if there is demand but nobody is paying real money for the tokens, they will plant some on the AH, and then increase the rate on the cash-shop, and then when they get buyers on the cash-shop, not plant them right away. Overall it will be 1v1, but they will pre-sell some tokens on the AH until buyers on the cash-shop appear and they will use the amount of pre-sold tokens on the AH as an indication to how quickly and how high they must put the gold value on the cash-shop to meet that demand.<br />
<br />
I don´t think they would ever put tokens on the AH on their own though, that would cost them real money.<br />
<br />
Example<br />
<br />
10 people want to buy tokens for 30k<br />
0 people want to sell tokens for 30k.<br />
Blizzard plants 10 tokens on the AH for 30k and raises the cash-shop price to 50k<br />
10 people go to the cash-shop and buy the tokens and receive 50k for them.<br />
<br />
10 people bought tokens for cash, 10 people bought tokens for gold. Overall it is 1v1. Yes, in this case Blizzard ´created´ gold that is going into the economy, but remember, the entire USA is buying/selling together, so more than likely that extra 20k gold per token will end up on 10 different servers, so no big deal.<br />
<br />
And once the price of these things stabilize, and we have a real supply/demand intersection, it won´t even be necessary to do this.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard us going to set the price based on how many are buying, and how many are selling. <br />
<br />
The cash buyer will always get his gold. The token buyer will always get their token.<br />
<br />
It will be the set half of Wildstar's system, not where the player could set buy or sell orders at a price they determine, but at some algorithm with a seed of 30k.<br />
<br />
This serves both the purpose of draining gold when there is no supply, and obtaining a premiuim fee for effectively selling gold when there is high demand.</div></div><hr />

Regarding the price... Objectively speaking and considering the WoW token tab in the AH is region wide, meaning it's the same for all servers, the price is pretty fair. Low populated realms will have far less sleeping gold than overpopulated realms. Therefore, the price of the wow token can't go higher when starting; it would be impossible for low populated realm players to buy a token. However, as soon as the gold gets balanced, realm level speaking, the price will start raising.</div></div><hr />

You should take into account the token is region wide. It's not server wide, and it's not that easy to get 30k/month on all servers. Low populated ones have poor AHs, have less people farming/grinding and therefore, less gold income aka slower gold fluctuation than highly populated ones. Gold in small servers is more valuable than gold in huge overloaded servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, that's not how they work and never will. It's just ridiculous, bots have been around long before the tokens were added to the game. It generally takes about 3-6 months before they start banning players. They don't just ban one person because they use a bot, it takes time and they don't want the bot developers to know what caused the ban in the first place. Blizz could add a new detection algorithm(haha, ye not likely) and if they started banning people right away the bot developers could find a loophole and all of the sudden the new detection barely made any difference. This is why they do large bans every now and then. Don't be surprised if you see the same bot running around outside your garrison for 3 months - I know I'm not. By the time they do get around to banning these bots it's too late, that's the worst part they've already affected the game in a very bad way and often pissed of legit players doing quests or farming materials.<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt; Anyways, I suspect shaddy players will be selling tokens at the auction house as well, they already sell pet/mount codes using hacked credit cards. How Blizz will deal with this should be very interesting to see. What if someone buys a token using a hacked credit card, they put the token up at the AH, it sells and that's it. If it was a mount or pet Blizz would just remove it from the buyers account and call it a day. How are they going to deal with the tokens?</div></div><hr />

Accounts without an active subscription will be able to log in with restrictions similar to starter accounts.<br />
There will be an option I believe on the character screen taking gold from multiple characters.<br />

Except the prices fluctuate, good luck trying to get a token for any cheaper than 60k in a month just to keep your account afloat all while trying to not get banned for botting. It will literally be a waste of time to bot mid to late expansion lifespan. tokens are always going to be cheapest at the beginning of an expansion and that's when the bots will be successful.</div></div><hr />

Even worse, it actually promotes botting for gold.<br />
<br />
I can't see this token idea lasting just as real money AH didn't last in Diablo.<br />
<br />
That's why the price is dynamic. From what I can gather, the interest (not investment interest) in the tokens is very high so I expect a sharp uptick in price shortly.</div></div><hr />

You will be charged for a new six months the day you sub expires. If you are using tokens that day just keeps moving into the future in 30 day chunks.</div></div><hr />

Ok well shucks then. Starter accounts also can't access shop. Can't buy off the AH. So there is no mechanic in place to acquire them if your account is inactive as of yet? So they added them but didn't really add them?</div></div><hr />
