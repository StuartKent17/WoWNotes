In World of Warcraft Patch 6.2, we’re making some changes to our Raid itemization with the goal of improving the Personal Loot experience, creating more interesting distinctions among items, and providing rewards that more closely reflect the challenge players face to earn them.<br />
<br />
Personal Loot Improvements<br />
The Personal Loot system offers several advantages to certain group types, but there are still several areas where we think we can make improvements. Our goals with Personal Loot going forward are threefold:<br />
<br />
Make Personal Loot more consistent and rewarding.<br />
Bring Personal Loot up to be competitive with Group Loot, so players who prefer Personal Loot receive rewards comparable to those you get from groups using Master Loot or Need/Greed.<br />
Celebrate rewarding Personal Loot within the group in a way that captures the excitement of receiving rewards in Group Loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
First, rather than treating loot chances independently for each player—sometimes yielding only one or even zero items for a group—we’ll use a system similar to Group Loot to determine how many items a boss will award based on eligible group size. As a result, groups will receive a much more predictable number of drops when they defeat a boss. In addition, set items will reliably drop in Personal Loot, just like they do in Group Loot today. The end result is that groups using Personal Loot will acquire their 2- and 4-piece set bonuses at around the same time as groups using Group Loot acquire theirs.<br />
<br />
We’re also increasing the overall rate of reward for Personal Loot, giving players more items overall to offset the fact that Personal Loot rewards can’t be distributed among group members. We know that finding that one awesome specific trinket to round out your gear set can be difficult with Personal Loot, and this should help increase your odds.<br />
<br />
Finally, the most visible change is the new Personal Loot UI. Part of the fun of raiding is progressing and improving as a group, not just as an individual. The previous Personal Loot system celebrated your own rewards, but would bury what your groupmates received in the chat log. However, the moment when your friend finally wins that long sought-after sword can be just as important to you as that moment you won your boots—and we wanted the game to help you celebrate it, too. Now when you loot an item, everyone in your group will see what you won!<br />
<br />
These Personal Loot improvements aren’t limited to Hellfire Citadel—we’re updating all of our Draenor dungeons, including Mythic dungeons, to use the same system.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;gallery-newlewt&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/thumb/new62Loot2.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/may/new62Loot2.jpg) &lt;/div&gt;<br />
<br />
Secondary Stats<br />
In the early days of World of Warcraft, Raid bosses didn’t have that many items to drop—there were only 150 items in all of Molten Core, and more than half of those were set items. This small amount of total gear in a Raid meant there might only have been one or two items per slot in an entire tier that were appropriate for your class—and if you were a Hunter or a Shaman in a place like Molten Core, that meant your only option for a belt in the entire Raid zone was your class set piece. On top of that, if an item wasn’t class restricted, it was shared between many other specializations with wildly different ideas of which stats were good or bad. When very few items were available to fill any given slot, the desire to make sure they were useful for many specs led us to keep from straying too far from a 50/50 split on secondary stats. <br />
<br />
As the game has evolved, we’ve increased the number of items that bosses drop per kill, as well as the variety of items they drop. We’ve made secondary stats more competitive with one another, and we’ve reduced the frequency of oddball items that were only useful to a few classes. This made more items useful to more people, but eroded the distinction and sense of identity that items held in the past. Too rare became the situation where you knew for sure that this drop was your awesome piece of equipment, and that feeling of finding a truly special item came less often than we would have liked.<br />
<br />
To help bolster that sense of excitement, we’ve decided to shake things up when it comes to how secondary stats appear on Raid loot in this patch. Inside Hellfire Citadel, you’ll see a wider range of high and low secondary stat values on items than you have in a long time. Alongside some tuning adjustments that should ensure your attuned stats are the right choice, this change should also make it easier for you to identify which items are good for you in a more interesting way than just “equip the highest Item Level.” Our goal is to help make Hellfire Citadel Raid items more distinct and meaningful to you, and we hope you’ll let us know how things feel once you start collecting your new gear.<br />
<br />
Item Level Ramp<br />
As this expansion has progressed, it’s become increasingly apparent that there is a mismatch between challenge and reward for guilds that delve deep into large Raid zones. When the Item Level for rewards across a given difficulty of a zone is flat, a caster staff from Heroic Imperator Mar’gok is largely equal in power to one from Heroic Tectus, despite Mar’gok being the far more challenging boss. We often see and hear about guilds killing a late-zone boss like Blast Furnace for the first time, only to disenchant most of the drops because everyone already has loot from earlier bosses in those slots. On top of that, many guilds move on to higher difficulties before they fully complete a difficulty, because Heroic Darmac loot is stronger than Normal Blackhand loot—and you can get it for much less effort.<br />
<br />
To address this, we are structuring Hellfire Citadel so that the Item Level of the loot awarded by bosses increases as players proceed deeper into the zone, culminating in Archimonde—providing both the ultimate challenge and the ultimate reward.<br />
<br />
... it feels good to get higher-level items as you progress through a zone.<br />
<br />
We’re doing this for a few reasons. First, it feels good to get higher-level items as you progress through a zone. One of the more prominent pieces of feedback we got about Blackrock Foundry was that it felt unrewarding for challenging bosses like Iron Maidens to drop loot that was just as good as—or possibly worse than—Gruul’s.<br />
<br />
This also breaks up where your best items are in a good way. The power of the items that you can get in a particular slot will differ based on how far through the zone you are. The best boots for you will likely be different if you are on Normal Gorefiend than they would be if you’re on Heroic Mannoroth, which would be different than if you’re on Mythic Iron Reaver, and so on.<br />
<br />
We can’t overstate how much we appreciate your feedback on topics like this, especially when you’ve taken the time to join us on the Patch 6.2 PTR and experienced the changes for yourself. As always, everyone’s encouraged to join us and other testers in the PTR Discussion forums as we prepare to unleash Hellfire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a terrible idea. Final boss sure, but having multiple bosses with higher ilvl than previous bosses? You're asking for class stacking to happen if there's 3 slots of cloth drops and caster weapons and 2 of leather and no agi weapons(example) off the higher ilvl bosses.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrKnubbles</div><div class="date">2015-05-20, 05:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the idea of having later bosses drop higher ilvl gear. Just like the example, I often move up to a higher difficulty before killing the final bosses because I've farmed earlier bosses and no longer need loot from the last boss.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalyma</div><div class="date">2015-05-20, 05:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should have some system in place that allows you to upgrade the item level of pieces of gear from earlier in the instance if you're able to defeat the later bosses.<br />
For example, your hunter gets a bow from boss 10 at item level 720, then a few weeks later you kill boss 13, and your warrior gets a 2hander with item level 730. Your hunter is sad but then over the following weeks if the hunter gets 3 or 4 kills on boss 13 he can upgrade his bow to be 730. Still get rewarded for going for more challenging bosses which feels good and also you end up on the same level as everyone else.</div></div><hr />

They've essentially made the items that drop off early bosses useless. Heroic gear that drops off Archimonde is better than most Mythic gear until you get to Archiomonde again. You're bis offset piece is determined by ilevel instead of stats. Some specs have available weapons that are 5 ilevel higher than others. <br />
<br />
I don't understand this. They are fixing a problem that didn't exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's often a pretty huge mismatch between wing progression and boss difficulty.<br />
<br />
Flamebinder is relatively far on in progression usually (About halfway through BRF?), but she's probably the easiest boss in the instance.</div></div><hr />

Because it won't be 1%, but don't cry to me later when back water guilds sit and tell you that you're not wanted.<br />
<br />
Melee have never been bad and yet sure min maxers carry less, but sure enough the whole &quot;melee are bad&quot; went like wildfire in Cata and melee shot themselves in the foot since nobody would take them.<br />

<br />
Archimonde for example only has a caster staff, caster mace, and a 2H str weapon. Kill him on normal and that sets you above players who kill heroic bosses that can't use those drops.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd say most tiers there's 1 or 2 hosses out of place, though T17 only Flamebender was extremely egregious. <br />
<br />
Anyways, what they are trying to avoid still makes sense regardless of difficulty of the actual boss: mass dis enchanting of later boss gear is an issue no matter how hard or easy it was. <br />
<br />
Personal loot was great changes all around I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there a skip option though? I highly doubt they'll let you do just the end bosses and Archimonde. Maybe a pass to Archimonde at best. So here we know you farmed those lower bosses, but fight them some more to gate you from the higher ilvls.</div></div><hr />

Man dont project your problems on to me. I have been raiding with the same ~15 people for 8 years. I do not get &quot;benched&quot; no one on our team does. I HIGHLY doubt masses of solid raid teams are going to shake up their roster just to maybe get 10 ilvls. Im sure some will but those progression guilds are not at ALL representative of raiders as a demographic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should not have been implemented now. WotLK had it right where LK dropped a higher ilvl but not the rest of the bosses. This would even be ok if there was 1 difficulty, but there's 4. So when your BiS has items from multiple difficulties..... there's a problem.</div></div><hr />

First they talk about how you should care about the right item with the stats you want, then they talk about how you should care about the items from the later bosses...<br />
<br />
Imagine that an earlier boss drops boots with your best stats, and a later boss drops boots with your worst stats. How does Blizzard intend for this to work?<br />
<br />
Either you'll have to throw away the higher ilevel boots because the secondary stats are too bad, or you'll have to throw away the lower ilevel boots because the higher ilevel ones just have too many stats.<br />
<br />
Either of the two options feels bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondary stat changes in Hellfire... I'll have to see for myself. I like the concept of trying to steer away from solely picking items based off ilvl, but I could see some complications when mixed with...<br />
<br />
Level ramp. This I am glad to see. Vanilla and BC had better loot from at least the end bosses of an instance. No reason to have completely even items across the board, as it feels dull and unrewarding as they point out. However, mixed with the secondary stat changes, there could be a few classes that feel gimped if the majority of their BiS items are in the lower-end of the raid tier.<br />
<br />
Time will tell, but I think these are all great changes to mix up WoD raiding for the better.</div></div><hr />

When can we expect release of 6.2?<br />
<br />
2 weeks after they announce the 2 week end of the arena season.</div></div><hr />

Are we sure this is a Blizzard Dev?<br />
<br />
They did do it to an extent in Dragon Soul, but backed out during MoP due to they not liking what happened with people more focusing on the bosses that gave the highest rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why they want us to choose gear based on stats (are we back to bloated loot table again?) and just after saying that, they say that we should use gear with high ilvl, so they're buffing the ilvl inside the raid?<br />
<br />
They're probably shooting themselves with that since the game already has serious problems with stat/ilvl scalling... One thing is to improve the last boss loot (even better in the last raid of the xpac), another is to make earlier drops from higher difficulty useless... (especially because of the scalling problem making everything easy that fast).<br />
<br />
Also, of course people don't care about loot from mythic/last bosses, since you can get them from garrison missions... I'm yet to kill Iron Maidens Mythic, but I don't care about it since I've got trinket and etc from the BRF garrison mission box... except from a tier token IF it's the piece I want/need for my 4pc I would care... a little...<br />
<br />
And the personal loot buff... crazy... but well, at least it seems we won't have to deal with group loot again in pugs...</div></div><hr />

Not to mention there's the problem of Archimonde not dropping weapons for every class/spec, so some classes will just get screwed over this tier (and being a caster I'm not one of them and I still think this is just a terrible decision).<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all this is just a way to artificially lengthen the time it takes for everyone to get gear, since all the pieces you need are on the last bosses, so you need to kill them a significant amount of times to get the drops you need.

Well obviously there needs to be larger changes as well to address this but it is a step in the right direction I think. However raid boss difficulty is also subjective in a lot of cases based on group skill level as a whole.</div></div><hr />

Secondary stats are so close that none are useless. You split hairs between one being valued at .53 and another .45. Yet that may come out to 100 dps in the end. Boring maybe but not useless.</div></div><hr />

Well to be fair bows, crossbows, and guns are all extremely under utilized/itemized because Hunters are the only class that can benefit from them so they cannot justify putting more than a few in the game making it extremely hard for a Hunter of any kind to get a weapon upgrade outside of crafting. Hopefully once they add the Dark Ranger in as a class it will solve this issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd imagine Archimonde will have weapons for everyone like Lich King that will be the highest ilvl obtainable and the rest of the bosses will have at least 1 option of a weapon per bracket of ilvl difficulty thus not having disparity.<br />
<br />
Kinda like this (fake ilvls just for the example):<br />
- Bracket 1 (Boss 1,2,3,4): ilvl 705 weapons<br />
- Bracket 2 (Boss 5,6,7,8): ilvl 715 weapons<br />
- Bracket 3 (Boss 9,10,11,12): ilvl 725 weapons<br />
- Bracket 4 (Archimonde): ilvl 735 weapons<br />
<br />
I think this would be the only way to be fair about it, else they'll have shitstorm brewing if there are only a few weapons that have the highest ilvl possible thus screwing over the classes that can't use them.<br />
<br />
Since the PTR isn't done yet we might see way more items added to the bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honest question here. <br />
Would you rather see something like Madness of Deathwing, where there are other weapons dropping throughout the instance, but the final boss has all the really good weapons? Its not an amp in Ilvl, but it is clearly an amp in player power.</div></div><hr />

I surely hope all of your BiS are from the first bosses so you can retract your this is how it should have been. When some player's BiS avg ilvl is 725 and others is 733, there's a problem.<br />

BIGGER Facepalm that you don't get that unless they make gear for every spec at 730/735, it's a complete and utter failure as some specs will out do others. Cry more when you do less damage/tanking/healing than others but don't cry to me.</div></div><hr />

Very interested to see how they will tune classes' secondary stats to make sure that the attuned stat is always most desirable, and very interested in seeing exactly how low and high secondary stats will go on gear.<br />
<br />
Also loving the ilvl rampup. It should allow real mythic raiders to really stand out gear wise from struggle guilds that clear half the raid for months and months that used to kinda end up in similar gear even though they only did half the raid.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blizzhoof</div><div class="date">2015-05-20, 07:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should have some system in place that allows you to upgrade the item level of pieces of gear from earlier in the instance if you're able to defeat the later bosses.<br />
For example, your hunter gets a bow from boss 10 at item level 720, then a few weeks later you kill boss 13, and your warrior gets a 2hander with item level 730. Your hunter is sad but then over the following weeks if the hunter gets 3 or 4 kills on boss 13 he can upgrade his bow to be 730. Still get rewarded for going for more challenging bosses which feels good and also you end up on the same level as everyone else.<br />
<br />
Great idea. I think that would solve the big issue that this ilvl progression system presents while preserving their intent.</div></div><hr />

Because screwing specs even more is a great idea. 2hander strength and 1h and 2h Intellect have 735 options, all the rest are limited to 730. Itemization also falls down the toilet, because itemlevel trumps itemization. For example, hunters have 3 ranged weapons available, a 730, a 725, and a 720. The 730 is perfectly itemized for both SV and MM, but BM's optimal itemization is on the 720 one instead. They get saddled with sub-par itemization because the other choice is having a 10 itemlevel deficit on their weapon.<br />
<br />
Same goes for Daggers. Mastery/Multistrike on the 730, Crit/Mastery on the 725, and Haste/Crit on the 720. The 730 has optimal itemization for Subtlety, but 725 is better itemized for Assassination. Basically, weapon itemization is now irrelevant, since only the highest itemlevel one can validly compete, and specs where that highest itemlevel weapon doesn't cater to get yet another shaft, in addition to the lower itemlevel shaft if you don't happen to be a caster or 2h Str user.</div></div><hr />

I like it because I'm sitting in all 685 loot while my casual guild is finishing normal Foundry (ilvl 670 loot). I haven't rolled on loot in months. I have to actually step down 15 ilvls to wear a piece of tier and that's ridiculous. The scaling makes a lot of sense actually.

Like, holy crap. Weapons are the biggest upgrades that anyone can get and most of us are just getting thrown under the bus? I fail to see how it's fair that some classes will get weapons 5 ilvls higher than others. I don't mind the ilvl ramp up, but it needs to be fair.<br />

<br />
No, they won't squish it. They haven't squished it yet. We've already gone from 640 to 705 ilvl in a single tier. That's 45 ilvls of gear. In Wrath of the Lich King, for instance, the entire expansion had only a 72 ilvl increase, and that was over 3.5 tiers. It really does matter, and it really does make a difference, especially in the Healing Role. Gear inflation pushes absorption healers way ahead of throughput healers, since they tend to scale far better with ilvl than throughput healers do. We're already at a point where every raid is basically required to bring at least one Paladin, and one Disc Priest, with the other 4 specs fighting for the last two spots. With enough gear, you can shave that four slots down to three. won't that just be ducky?</div></div><hr />

Unless you have zero loot on early bosses some classes will always get their items first. That's how it goes. Even then RNG could screw you for months before you see the drop you need.

Yeah, Tier 18 is going to be close to Tier 15 numbers allready. They may have to squish next expansion. They didnt squish enough in the first place tbh. Squish us down to doing 2500 dps in tier 19 raid gear. That should give them 3 expansions.</div></div><hr />

The only time I ever see it used is in PUGs, but I'm glad they're upping the drops for those individuals and making it a set number of drops per group. The only problem with that random distribution is that I may not need anything on a boss, and I might get loot when someone else needed it; that's sort of how it is now but since the personal drops are now so-many-per-group, it can create some tension if I win something that I don't need because that means I took away someone else's loot. Eek. But anyway, that's why we roll with Master Looter under MS/OS in guild runs to avoid all this chaos.<br />
<br />
I think the Personal Loot changes are for PUGs, not guild runs - if they intended it for everyone, they'd remove the other loot rules. <br />
<br />
It helps destroy the bs that &quot;personal loot drops less&quot;, so it'll make personal loot runs more attractive and prevalent - or that's what I think the intent is - whether you see more personal loot runs show up is on the players, and I don't think the PUG douchebags are going to stop because of this. They worked hard to instill the meme of &quot;ML drops more loot&quot;, they're not going to give up their scam that easily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So is it some crazy balancing thing to have some classes take ilvl hits to get the attuned stats while other classes get to have higher ilvl? Just funnel certain interesting items into the later bosses like weapons, trinkets and tier. Make those higher ilvl than everything in earlier areas but apply it to ALL items of the same slot.</div></div><hr />

No it wouldn't.<br />
<br />
It would only work if all specs would scale equally with all secondary stats. (Which is mathematically impossible)<br />
<br />
So now, a few &quot;chosen&quot; specs will out perform all others, because they &quot;happen&quot; to &quot;like&quot; the secondary stats provided by the highest item level items.<br />
<br />
This is such a moronic and idiotic change that I'm having a hard time expressing how utterly DUMB it is, in a world where some stats have a significant higher value than others.<br />
<br />
Crit = 0.8980<br />
Haste = 0.7290<br />
Multistrike = 0.5716<br />
Versatility = 0.4899<br />
Mastery = 0.3663<br />
<br />
Just look at that difference between Crit and mastery for Shadow AS. That's a factor of 2.4!<br />
Crit is TWO AND A HALF times as valuable to us compared to mastery.<br />
<br />
We’ve made secondary stats more competitive with one another<br />
No, Blizzard... you didn't. That's why this idiocy won't work.<br />
And don't even get me started on the classes that get shafted by no weapon drop from Archi. W T F are these devs smoking?! <br />
Has the company Kindergarten taken over development?!<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
To help bolster that sense of excitement, we’ve decided to shake things up when it comes to how secondary stats appear on Raid loot in this patch. Inside Hellfire Citadel, you’ll see a wider range of high and low secondary stat values on items than you have in a long time<br />
<br />
Does this mean we'll see gear drops like the crafted gear? Where you can have a range of say 120-180 of each secondary stat but has a constant amount of total secondary stats? If so I feel very hesitant to seeing this as a good change. Now that BIS item will be warforged/socket/favored stat. In effect could just be another means of stretching out the time it takes to get geared.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is such a moronic and idiotic change that I'm having a hard time expressing how utterly DUMB it is, in a world where some stats have a significant higher value than others.<br />
<br />
I'm 100% with you there. It almost makes me wonder if blizzard is using the itemization as a means to boost underperforming specs by giving them the favorable ilvl boosts from the harder boss drops.</div></div><hr />

Bigger loot table - stretches the content out longer, because you'll have to run the raid more to get the pieces you want.<br />
<br />
Or, this is another one of Blizzard's Grand Experiments, which will be quickly forgotten and swept under the rug in 7.0.<br />

Just a moment [frantic whispering heard off stage]<br />
Nevermind... <br />
<br />
Ya, for MM, weapon damage is something like 3 times as potent as Agility for me, nearly 5 times as potent as Crit (my best stat), and over 6 times as potent as my worst stat. There's zero probability of be selecting a lower itemlevel weapon with better itemization.<br />
<br />
Then again, the 730 bow is perfectly itemized for MM and SV (slight weight towards SV due to the significantly higher Multistrike on it), so not really an issue, except the complete lack of a 735 option. The extra 5 item levels, just in weapon DPS, is equivalent to an extra 165 Crit Rating or 102 Agility. The extra itemlevel would also add 20 additional Agility and 26 additional rating. Net difference is around 900 DPS with my current weights, or around 2% DPS.<br />
<br />
So ya, I lose 2% DPS just because I'm not a caster or 2h strength class. Awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then wotlk came along and they made the earlier bosses drop higher ilvl gear than previous tier's final bosses PLUS the multiple difficulties with each one giving higher and higher ilvl gear than the last tier and stats just went crazy and the difference between a fresh max level char and a raider became absurd.</div></div><hr />

Leaderboards added for this. Each time you defeat a boss on another tier it gains 2 item levels. After an expansion ends Nemesis mode is removed for all the raids that expansion. <br />
<br />
Once you beat a mode, you can choose to do that mode next week. If you have gotten to tier 10 =50% more difficult, you can choose rank 11-1 for that week. <br />

It could also make older raids in an expansion relevant longer. Once the tier is over though, the leaderboards for that tier are locked, and the achievements are removed. The gear scaling does stay however.</div></div><hr />

If your guild has a problem with benching people over 10ilvl on one or two pieces, well, I really can't muster any shits to give for you with your attitude. His doesn't. Mine certainly won't. It may or not even be a problem worth solving in the big picture.<br />
<br />
It was done even in TBC, although not nearly to the degree that it was done in vanilla. Every other boss progressed 2 ilvl upgrade in vanilla. In TBH the first half and the second half would be of different ilvls.<br />
<br />
That kind of progression made sense, because there was only one difficulty. Wrath was the beginning of multiple difficulties, and so that was where the ilvl disparity within the tier came from, doing the hard fights or the easy version, not just the later fights. It meant everyone got to see the dungeon on easy mode but the true raiders got the rewards for doing it the hard way.<br />
<br />
Not that I disagree with this model at all, it's great. You are also going to see what you saw in vanilla. Mythic BRF to Mythic HFC is going to be a disparity in ilvl, but mythic BRF is still better than the first two difficulties of HFC.</div></div><hr />

This is the second post in 2 weeks I have seen explaining their actions / ideas. I had un-subbed 4 weeks into BRF and stopped playing. However I am considering re-subbing and playing if they keep up this level of communication, its a good sign to see reason behind decisions/ideas. <br />
<br />
Wait to see if they actually respond to the serious issues people are raising with the itemlevel ramping. If they don't, the communication is nothing but PR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They aren't communicating with the player base though. <br />
<br />
Weapons are extremely important for player functionality and it just so happens that the only boss that drops ilvl 735 items only has a str 2h and caster staff on his loot table. If this loot table featured weapons viable for every spec as well as the trinkets and was only ramped up for Archimonde then this system would be more along the lines of what players like. Currently, some specs will have BiS ilvl ~5-6 higher than other specs. Not to mention that the talk of competitive secondary stats is all talk (definitely not the case with PTR based stat weights). <br />
<br />
On another note, some of the tier dropping bosses have this ramped up ilvl thing while the tier gear doesn't. Example: Mannoroth drops ilvl 730 loot while mythic tier is 725. That's just dumb...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm in that boat on my main currently in mythic BRF. I'm still not sure if I like this though, simply for the sake of the casual raiders who definitely want to see end-game content but just don't have the time or availability to be in a raid guild that puts forth big effort (as in 3-4 nights, 4+ hours, whatever it may be).</div></div><hr />

They've essentially made the items that drop off early bosses useless. Heroic gear that drops off Archimonde is better than most Mythic gear until you get to Archiomonde again. You're bis offset piece is determined by ilevel instead of stats. Some specs have available weapons that are 5 ilevel higher than others. <br />
<br />
I don't understand this. They are fixing a problem that didn't exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
This also means you can disenchant all eairly loot. and get the option to pass bosses, cuz when progress is over. first 10 bosses out of 14 will be retarded to do and waste of time. since they drop shit loot...<br />
<br />
This and this. They're fucking up itemization even worse. D3 loot system is not desirable to players, only devs trying to drag out the loot carrot to infinity. But in the mountain of mistakes, this is just another pebble. As usual, some players think this is a great idea, because they're short sighted.<br />
<br />
It does make some logical sense for harder bosses to drop better loot, but forcing everyone to do easy bosses for shit loot to get to the good bosses is poor design. End bosses dropping better loot is fine and dandy, but dragging it out past that is just a piss-poor idea. One among many being implemented yet again.</div></div><hr />

And your weapon will drop from the first boss and will be 15 itemlevel lower compared to the 2H weapons for other classes that drop at the final boss... <br />

<br />
Dunno whats hard to understand that there's a 10 item level difference inside one difficulty, which results in some items being better than others, WHILE not having an option for an upgrade. Half of your raid will have worse weapons/trinkets/etc. than the rest, leaving a few lucky ones with 735 BiS pieces off Archimonde.<br />
<br />
EVEN IF they fix the above problem (which they wont), the only possible fix would leave 3/4 of the raid bosses useless, since they wont ever drop upgrades. Everyone will rush to the last bosses - this will further dimish the interest in raiding since Blizzard is only able to cause problems, like America bringing &quot;peace&quot; to the Middle-East countries. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Anyone who is not able to understand what difference 10 item levels have, remember the +5 ilvl bump on BRF items which resulted in a +20% dmg increase for most classes.</div></div><hr />

Every piece of gear has 3 stats:<br />
<br />

- Str/Agi/Int<br />
- Mastery<br />
<br />
Stuff like versatility, crit etc. can stay &quot;under the hood&quot; but i don't want to bother about them. I.e. Blizz could just define fix values for them according to your class/spec. sounds dull, but hey i don't care in the end how high my multistrike is and why.<br />
<br />
Consequently, its all about my ilvl epeen in the end. Higher ilvl item is ALWAYS better and an upgrade, everyone understands that, no further fuss involved. Ilvl ramp is also fine for me. I got my 2H sword from Boss 3, Boss 10 has a higher one. When i am able to kill Boss 10 with my raid and the Sword drops, Pallyboy, Warriboy and Dkboy roll. The winner is happy and shits out higher numbers from now on.<br />

Simple but effective. Complexity should be limited to Class and Boss encounter mechanics imho.</div></div><hr />

I'm gonna give you the same answer. It's always been like that. There was nobody complaining about it then? It's suppose to be this way, harder bosses should drop better loot. <br />
<br />
<br />
Have you considered that all classes BiS maybe have 1 or 2 items with lower ilvl? And that it evens out? Highest ilvl is not always the best..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which same answer? Are you able to follow arguments? We havent seen something like this since TBC and this had a reason. WotLK introduced different difficulties for raid instances. Harder bosses (mythic) still drop better loot than easier bosses (heroic and below).<br />
<br />
And no, it doesnt even out. A belt or ring slot is different (read: worse) than a weapon/trinket/chest slot item. And if your main stat is your best stat than a 10 ilvl difference is enought to replace it with an item with worse stats.</div></div><hr />

For example, your hunter gets a bow from boss 10 at item level 720, then a few weeks later you kill boss 13, and your warrior gets a 2hander with item level 730. Your hunter is sad but then over the following weeks if the hunter gets 3 or 4 kills on boss 13 he can upgrade his bow to be 730. Still get rewarded for going for more challenging bosses which feels good and also you end up on the same level as everyone else.<br />
<br />
That's the best idea I ever read. Just have the later bosses/archimonde drop an item that allows you to upgrade an item to the ilvl of that boss. Or a repeateable quest that requires 5 kills or something like that. Would be amazing.</div></div><hr />

It's possible to balance tho. There are 3 'stat' tiers if I remember correct. One for head/chest/pants, one for gloves/shoulder/belt/boots and one for bracer/rings/neck. Give class A a high ilvl chest, gloves and 1 ring, give class B a high ilvl pants/shoulder/bracer. Not rocket science. Question is if it's worth it.<br />
<br />
Also class balance isnt as tight in WoW as you make it out to be. Classes are far further apart damage wise that a few stats on 1-2 pieces will ever do for them. If you really believe a mage would have suddenly been 'easily beaten' or 'benched' this tier by a shadow priest because that priest got a 10 ilvl higher stat chest you're delusional.<br />
<br />
So lets take class balance for what it is, flawed, at least we can give players a better upgrade path in raids instead of nerfing the fun for 'balance' that isn't there in the first place anyway. Who cares about balance when classes are this far apart to begin with anyway, lets fix that first and then complain about extremely marginal differences that 30 stats on a chest will make. <br />
<br />
Oh lastly, I complete agree weapons are in a different 'tier' and should certainly be balanced ilvl wise because their impact is too large. But who cares about a random chest/boots.</div></div><hr />

So lets take class balance for what it is, flawed, at least we can give players a better upgrade path in raids instead of nerfing the fun for 'balance' that isn't there in the first place anyway. Who cares about balance when classes are this far apart to begin with anyway, lets fix that first and then complain about extremely marginal differences that 30 stats on a chest will make. <br />
<br />
Oh lastly, I complete agree weapons are in a different 'tier' and should certainly be balanced ilvl wise because their impact is too large. But who cares about a random chest/boots.<br />
<br />
Didnt you question yourself while writing this? Lets say they balance everything out, rings being as powerful statwise as chests, etc - then this whole ilvl ramp up would make less sense than it actually does now.</div></div><hr />

Of course in friendly and balanced guild some small imbalance of dps doesn't matter (who cares which class tops dps matters if the build kills stuff together unless it doesn't make the whole guild carry that one/two persons) but doing for many hours long raid instance where nothing good drops is just pure masochism.</div></div><hr />

A small (and I mean very small) amount of trust has been restored for me at least in the devs concern for the game being actually fun and rewarding.<br />

I think they should try to implement an system that is rewarding for all raidmembers not the ones who are lucky with some classes. I advocate the idea that demanding bosses drop better loot - to feel prgression better.<br />
<br />
What about the idea:<br />
<br />
If you got items from the Hellfire Assault with ilvl 690 - the next ids you kill (a eligible for looting) bosses from the next wing which drops 695, every Boss drops an item to upgrade the items from the former wing by 5 levels - and so on the next wing drops items to upgrade your items from the wing before by +5 ilvl and so on ... yes the idea must be made bulletproof.<br />
<br />
Or if you kill a ilvl 695 boss all bosses before drop ilcl 695 items for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problems start when the developers start comparing the game as it is now to the game as it was in Molten Core. One will remember as we all did with the 10 year anniversary that not only is the game drastically different now than it was then, gearing and how gear worked was as well. They admit to reducing bad itemizing and overall eliminating forced single drops (I.E. their example given with the hunter/shaman belt) despite these problems being glaringly obvious and should barely be recognized as achievements and more fixing the game. Giving them credit for atleast trying, moving on to making secondary stats competitive seems like a no-brainer to anyone now, and then felt really stupid for a stat to be completely useless for a class despite it being on their armor.<br />
<br />
So far, we've get net nothing but an explanation on why they are attempting to add this new sense of excitement. How might you ask? By fluxing the secondary stats of items to prefer one or the other. In the article it plainly states they are wanting to move away from &quot;equip the highest item level&quot; gameplay. That's... News to me considering the next bit... The paragraph below it... Talking about -item level ramp up-.<br />
<br />
This fancy new system has bosses farther in the raid drop better loot than the previous bosses, culminating in the final boss dropping the best loot! It sounds like a great idea, just like the previous idea, but when combined you get this mixed message of &quot;We don't want you to equip the highest item level equipment, however the perfectly itemized Rune Infused Spear (http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=124377/rune-infused-spear&amp;bonus=0) for feral/ww just dropped from Kormrok, but it's replaced by the vastly inferior Xu'tenash, Glaive of Ruin (http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=124378/xutenash-glaive-of-ruin&amp;bonus=0)of Mannoroth.&quot;<br />
<br />
What is the message Blizzard is trying to send here? Is that Ilvl doesn't matter? That secondary stats should be a deciding factor, but only when the ilvls are equal, yet they deliberately make the ilvls scale recklessly within a difficulty without equality, especially regarding weapons? This change makes no sense. Nothing about the last two additions in this watercooler would end up being good down the road. One, or the other maybe, but both at the same time? That's begging for raiders to get fed up with replacing items in the same difficulty. I for one am already tired of replacing it through 2-4 difficulties. This is just ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

I understand the change to the loot ilvl. It makes sense conceptually. As someone in a guild that can't put a ton of time into raiding (5-6 hours a week), its going to get frustrating when you have clear bosses that are now no longer challenging AND don't drop any gear you need. As it stands right now, there are still a handful of pieces could be upgrades, and people can still get gemmed/warforged versions of stuff they are wearing. I personally think having to spend an hour plus on bosses that are nothing more than a time sink, and are effectively difficult trash between you and the things you need to kill for gear/progression will be worse than having hard bosses (aka Blast Furnace) dropping the same ilvl gear as easy bosses (aka Beastmaster).</div></div><hr />

Specs whose weapons/trinkets are not included in the loot table for the end bosses will become obsolete or at least sub-optimal and undesirable as a whole. <br />
<br />
Rather than dropping higher ilevel loot from later bosses, let the later bosses drop a generic upgrade item - e.g. a Sunmote - which can be used to upgrade any suitable item to a higher ilevel.</div></div><hr />

Having to track itemiztion while also dealing with a well itemized item that is not as good simply becuase the later drop has a full 10 ilvls, that is a lot of primary stats. I have already taken a look at the gear and although there is a wide variety of gear i can already notice some of these examples happening just as has been mentioned before me. It just comes down to i feel the gap is far too large between these gear peices and i do not want to invalidate my gear simply becuase of ilvl ramp up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) They should get rid of &quot;progression&quot; or BiS gear from the last boss and introduce interesting/incredible rewards to show off the fact that you've defeated the last boss on the hardest difficulty and perhaps before any nerfs....something more than a mount. <br />
<br />
On Mythic include an extra item which makes the power of your set bonuses so incredibly more stronger that it becomes easier to farm the last boss, since you've killed it already and therefore you are rewarded doing so with less wipes. These items and rewards would only be available to guild groups consisting of no less than 20 players and only work withing groups consisting of at least 15 players (who have the kill/achievement).<br />
<br />
On heroic...add an artifact that can make tiered or other items warforged or to add a socket. <br />
<br />
2) Trinkets are arguably some of the strongest items in the game. And so are weapons. Have a system so that...early bosses drop said weapon/trinket...latter bosses drop an artifact to help increase the power of these items in an interesting way. Or keep the current system, since tier sets normally drop off really difficult bosses, and have them drop another artifact which increases the ilevel of your tier or adds an extra socket. This will be available on personal loot only perhaps. Personal loot has 100% to drop these artifacts once your toon has exhausted all of the loot table for a particular boss, these items need not be equipped.<br />
<br />
3) Personal loot. Needs to improve. I'm waiting on changes. I think they could do some really interesting things with personal loot. I've discussed on the forums that they should integrate the coin roll and personal loot system. However item hunters who like using coin roll's flexibility may not partake to this idea very easily.<br />
<br />

<br />
That system can work IF a boss only drops loot for one or two fixed slots. Like Archimonde only drops weapons/trinkets, Gorefiend only drops belts/bracers and so on. That way everybody has access to the same quality of loot for every slot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ilvl ramp across the instance is great, though.<br />
<br />
As for the secondary stats... If they hadn't gutted stat to begin with at the beginning of the expansion, it would probably haven't been necessary...<br />
<br />
So guaranteed loot for raids on personal loot is bad? The primary reason no one uses it is because there's no guarantee you will see more than 1 drop even with 30 people.</div></div><hr />

I just finished a 45min argument with my friend and guild tank about weapon ilvl discrepancies in 6.2. He seems to feel its no big deal because ultimately the ilvl of the entire raid group will even out by the last boss. I feel that weapons and trinkets are the true generators of dps especially since weapons can be enchanted and trinkets have additional procs. I really don't care if i get a 730 pair of boots or gloves. I do care about getting shafted on a weapon because blizzard put it on early boss loot table. Maybe I'm just pissy because I had to wait 6 months for a hunter weapon drop in H HM/ H BRF and everyone else had their weapons drop early on. It just feels punitive.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard also mentioned that higher lvl raids are a guild / group environment and that the DPS of the group overall is intended to be more important than the DPS of one individual.

I started raiding hardcore in Wotlk so I was not apart of the whole overall group dps part of this game. Do you or anyone else here think that if they are indeed going back to this style of raiding in the higher level raids will they add more utility for the lower DPS classes and things of that nature to avoid the stacking of higher dps classes at that point?<br />

As this expansion has progressed, it’s become increasingly apparent that there is a mismatch between challenge and reward for guilds that delve deep into large Raid zones. When the Item Level for rewards across a given difficulty of a zone is flat, a caster staff from Heroic Imperator Mar’gok is largely equal in power to one from Heroic Tectus, despite Mar’gok being the far more challenging boss. We often see and hear about guilds killing a late-zone boss like Blast Furnace for the first time, only to disenchant most of the drops because everyone already has loot from earlier bosses in those slots. On top of that, many guilds move on to higher difficulties before they fully complete a difficulty, because Heroic Darmac loot is stronger than Normal Blackhand loot—and you can get it for much less effort.<br />
<br />
To address this, we are structuring Hellfire Citadel so that the Item Level of the loot awarded by bosses increases as players proceed deeper into the zone, culminating in Archimonde—providing both the ultimate challenge and the ultimate reward.<br />
<br />
We’re doing this for a few reasons. First, it feels good to get higher-level items as you progress through a zone. One of the more prominent pieces of feedback we got about Blackrock Foundry was that it felt unrewarding for challenging bosses like Iron Maidens to drop loot that was just as good as—or possibly worse than—Gruul’s.<br />
<br />
This also breaks up where your best items are in a good way. The power of the items that you can get in a particular slot will differ based on how far through the zone you are. The best boots for you will likely be different if you are on Normal Gorefiend than they would be if you’re on Heroic Mannoroth, which would be different than if you’re on Mythic Iron Reaver, and so on.<br />
<br />
We can’t overstate how much we appreciate your feedback on topics like this, especially when you’ve taken the time to join us on the Patch 6.2 PTR and experienced the changes for yourself. As always, everyone’s encouraged to join us and other testers in the PTR Discussion forums as we prepare to unleash Hellfire.<br />

That could be really nice IF ppl was running normal/heroic or mythic only with them guilds, atm everyone using LFG and open pugs that is not an improvement or a reward to guilds, ppl will goes to harder bosses with pugs and they can get easy the item they want, and again when them guild (if they are in one) reach the specific boss they will disenchant again the item because they will already looted in a pug..<br />
<br />
I wonder when you will realized that LFG and open pugs have destroyed the game and the guilds, special those are not hard core or pop up every new tier and disbanded on next one.. All those years after Wotlk the only think you do is to make things worst instead of better, i understand that the only think you care is the subscribes but that won’t work for long with this way.<br />

This item level progression is a bad idea. They've essentially made the items that drop off early bosses useless. Heroic gear that drops off Archimonde is better than most Mythic gear until you get to Archiomonde again. You're bis offset piece is determined by ilevel instead of stats. Some specs have available weapons that are 5 ilevel higher than others. <br />
<br />
I don't understand this. They are fixing a problem that didn't exist.<br />
<br />
I agree with you, this idea sux, soon we will face ppl who will ask for joining specific bosses and dont even care for guild progress which including wipes and not boost run to harder bosses.</div></div><hr />
