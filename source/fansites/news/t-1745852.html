Blue Tweets<br />
Misc<br />
WoW was never a sandbox MMO. Its framing and &quot;themepark&quot; approach is a big part of why we play it instead of its competitors.<br />
WoW does what it does well, am I'm not inclined to see it reinvented as something it's not. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/579800688307257344))<br />
I am interested in seeing the market in general explore other angles though, both as a gamer and as a designer. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/579800792787390464))<br />

Fan Concept - Garrisons Mobile App<br />
Sinfonianartist shared (http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/2zwg8v/mobile_garrison_proof_of_concept_update/) a mockup of what garrisons could look like (http://imgur.com/gallery/H2v6g/) in the mobile app. Keep in mind this is just a fan concept and that developers have said it is very unlikely garrisons will come to the mobile app.<br />

<br />
Yesterday it was Rift and Wildstar the day before. This is a really rough time for WoW news but chauds still doing a great job with the front page. It's in slow times like these that you have to rely more on community content or even branch out a bit. Ultimately blue tweets are the bread and butter of the front page but volume has dropped lately with no more twitter announcements and just the one account. Hopefully we get a 6.2 PTR sometime in the next month.</div></div><hr />

Knowing Sinfonianartist and having played with the unfinished version on my phone, I can attest that the app is real and he has done all the behind the scenes coding himself. He has used all database info to make the app function as it would in game. It is rather nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What exploit? I think you're not understating this change... this is indeed a nerf. Before this fix you could get to 20% and get a Dreadnaught at the same time which made the fight an instant wipe. Now you can push to 20% after second boat and if you get there on time (when before fix you needed to push it like 15 secs before to not get a dreadnaught) you won't ever see the third boat. So this changes makes it easier to push kills with only two boats safely.</div></div><hr />

Right? I unsubbed a couple months ago and have drastically cut back on my visits here while focusing on school but every time I come here it just seems like graphs and hotfixes.<br />

yeah but as an APP being an extra way of doing stuff while not actually in the game is a neat extra, if you want the full experience and ease you'd log in on the game. Same as Auction house</div></div><hr />

They arent going to continue it into another expansion so why waste the time coding it into a mobile app? Plus, thats one of the BEST ways they have to keep people subbed and logging in right now. I know a lot of people (myself included) who only log in twice a day to flip garrisons and then on raid days. <br />
<br />
There is a lot of waiting around going on already and its sad that WoD started with such potential but Blizz cant keep up or adds stupid ways for their own content to be consumed even faster. Raiding Loot that is BoE is a big one (dont even have to work for gear now), bonus rolls for normal+ raids (cant hold gear over people in guild runs to keep them coming back, they can roll into their own), crafting was completely screwed (even recent changes wont fix that), all classes/specs were gutted to the point of being super boring for most of them (nothing feels unique anymore). About the only thing I can say they really improved upon this xpac is the questing exp but thats only nice one, maybe 2 times and even then you dont get to keep doing that once you hit end game. <br />
<br />
I just feel like this xpac was a lot of missed opportunities and hopefully the rumors are true that the next one is already feature complete, will be announced at Blizzcon and out to us by late this year or early next. Im ready to be done with WoD...</div></div><hr />
