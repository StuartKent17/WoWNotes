<br />
If ppl are at the secrets/runestones part of the chain, they have the wrathion buff until 6.0 arrives. So in reality they still have time.<br />
Ppl stuck on the valor quest, on the other hand, will go directly to the secrets portion of the chain, with a month of gametime to get all secrets+titan runestones. Since the wrathion buff will end coming 6.0 and with bad rng they will not make it (managed to get 2 runestones during 1 week, lei-shen and sha of pride 100% drops, rest nothing).</div></div><hr />

Well Engins get the speed boost although it stacks with a pot now (still free right) and the glider but only out of combat. I think Alcs still get extra flask duration (cheaper flasks as last longer) and enchanters can DE on fly without having to go back to the garry. <br />

Is it only 1 out of the 3, or can you get all 3 things on 1 item?<br />
<br />
If it's in the case of the last option, I guess it'll take quite a bit longer now if someone wants to get BiS gear in WoD :D Per say; what are the chances you get a Warforged tier set helm including 2 sockets? Must be a 1% drop chance or something<br />

<br />
nah. CotFW anyone can get at any time they want in a matter of secs. While anyone can get the cape (i.e., there is no real challenge per se) the challenge is dedicating the time to get it. pretty much anyone just resubbing today and really not aware of the game since 5.0 or 5.1 won't get their bearings straight and get the legendary quest done in time.<br />
<br />
further, i know plenty of people who for whatever reason just never did it--usually they stall out at the &quot;do BGs&quot; phase or on the valor quest. in ways its the antithesis of CotFW. It got super easy as the game progressed, especially for new players, etc. legendary questline will literally be deleted and unattainable.<br />
<br />
i still think deleting it is dumb... id rather have no title and ability to get cape than have a title and cancel the quest.</div></div><hr />

I never bothered because I'm not in a raiding guild and don't enjoy LFR. Even after flex came out, I wasn't interested in grinding raids every week for months to get a cloak that'll be useless in a few months. (This was when we were expecting a summer expansion release.)<br />
<br />
I might go back and finish it on my most progressed character-- he was up to the ToT gathering phase when I switched to a different main-- but....</div></div><hr />

I tend to agree. Randomizing off-pieces I'm fine with, but tier tokens have enough competition, this was not needed, nor will it make for a fun group dynamic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I think we understand. There won't ever be an &quot;extra tier token&quot; because people will constantly be fighting over the tier token of the tier they already have in hopes of getting the bonus. In guilds it might be manageable with rules, but in pugs and even with ninjas it will be another big issue.<br />
<br />
The only bonus of this could occur in Flex now Normal because the loot system is personalized.<br />
<br />
Unless I'm missing something and Heroic and Mythic loot is now personalized as well?</div></div><hr />

Any piece that's not WF+sockt+3erstats will be pretty much useless... that's.<br />
<br />
for people that think that &quot;extra&quot; is cool... is only cool if they are &quot;extra&quot; but socket and WF gear will be pretty much mandatory like right now... Gear is the only way for Caracter Power in WoW. and should no be RNG so hard like now. boss will drop 4-5 piece. start praying to RNGod for your piece to drop and be +WF+socket+3er stats.</div></div><hr />

Going to hate this. Everyone is going to want tier tokens until they get that 1% perfect piece. With all the rest of gear you can pass on standard gear because it doesn't have an increased ilvl, tetrary stats, or a socket. This is going to just waste tons of tier tokens.</div></div><hr />

LFM challenge mode, need to have at least X sockets.<br />
<br />
You will care. Especially when things will come to recruitment, if you will ever want to find raid guild, you won't be taken if RNG didn't favor you.<br />
<br />
And why it will fail in WoW, is because it has weekly lockouts. In games like Diablo you can grind until you turn green in face.<br />
<br />
Let us see.<br />
Chance to get token per week: 50% (I am being very generous as competition will never stop).<br />
Chance for it to be warforged: 50% (yet again I am being very generous here).<br />
Chance for it to have socket: 50% (yet again I am being very generous here).<br />
Chance for it to have desired tertiary stat: 20% (very generous, assuming you have 20% chance per stat, and 20% of no stat).<br />
<br />
Calculation: You need minimum 40 weeks in order to get 1 (one) desired tier piece (still no warranty). By the time you get that one desired tier piece, the whole raid tier will already become obsolete.<br />
<br />
I am so glad I am done with this game. WoD is recipe for disaster in all game aspects. It is going to be far worse than Cata (and the massive destruction of guilds by &quot;flexible lockouts&quot;), and it is too late for developers to fix all their mistakes already.<br />
<br />
P.S.: One of many reasons why WotLK was loved, is because it was expansion with least RNG in WoW. Even heroic tier tokens in t9/10 were made either classless or slotless, bosses didn't have loot tables 100 pages long and badges were actually useful (a lot of various gear pieces, BoA reputation hand-ins, gems, raid craft mats and even some BoE pieces of gear which made some living for the raiders). Blizzard knows that raiders are minority of players, still they want to push RNG sky-high, something which was hated since EQ1.</div></div><hr />

Listen guys, Warforged, sockets, and tertiary stats are now rare bonuses. RARE BONUSES. You will not need full Warforged, sockets, and tertiary stats to do anything raid related, Mythic will be cleared without them, I guarantee you. They are nothing more than an incentive to go back and get more loot, but an extra 5 ilevel, or a tiny movespeed boost aren't going to change anything!<br />

Because this means shitton of dditional loot drama shitton of &quot;i want to be on this boss cause tier may or may not drop aand screw people who still dont have tier i want chance of teritiary/etra socket&quot;<br />

Not exactly.<br />
main and secondary stats + setbonus are fixed. So if you get it the first time it will be a good upgrade.<br />

Problem lies in the fact that the same people will want it again and again, thus driving item costs up for people that didn't yet get one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
doesnt that mean everyone will want tier pieces till they get all the good stats? :/<br />
<br />
Yes and this will i think provoke loot drama - no one will pass for an tier items until he/she got the BIS one ... and it will be unusual to skip raids oder pass for an friend - because you have to be there and kill the boss as long as you do not have the BIS version of an item.<br />
<br />
It a similar loot system as in Diablo - the stats will be visible after turning in/identifying the item. This system i presume is a time saver for the devs - they do not need to design specific items that much they only define (proc) ranges.<br />

Suicide kings and a bit of loot council and it won't be an issue. Tell the pugs beforehand, if they have an issue get another pug. They're lucky to be brought in the first place, there is always someone else willing to take their place and know their place.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazmina</div><div class="date">2014-09-19, 12:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tier gear with bonus stats is nice. Not showing the bonuses it has until you activate it (like timeless isle loot) could be problematic, but for most guilds since you don't know what it has, tier will work just like it usually does for the first round. People without tier get priority over those who do.<br />
<br />
Only issue really crops up when everyone has at least un-bonused tier. Then you will have everyone bidding (Or whatever system your guild uses) on tier, though priority would likely go to people who have un-bonused gear/<br />
<br />
The issue really isn't as big a deal as some people are making it out to be. And will make farm night much less boring. (Right now 99% of tier gear gets vendored and has been for last 3-4 months in my guild.)<br />
<br />
Also RNG is a non issue. 20 raiders, 14 slots, 3 possible bonuses per item all rolled on separate chances, 5 drops per boss (Mythic) at large numbers luck becomes irrelevant like tossing a coin a million times vs 10. Assuming two guilds have same progression they will have nearly the same gear level overall among their raiders.<br />
<br />
Its nearly statistically impossible that one guild of equal progression will be running for tri bonus gear while another has full 0 bonus gear.</div></div><hr />

Right click general tab. Go to settings. Go to global channels. Turn off trade chat. Right click general tab. Go to create new chat window. Name it &quot;trade&quot;. Right click trade tab, go to settings. Go to global channels. Turn on trade chat.<br />
<br />
Now your main chat channel is trade free, if you want to look at trade click the trade tab.</div></div><hr />

This is partially true. Bellular did a video about Tertiary VS WF vs socket. Having a socket is always BIS (provides more stats than WF). So until I (for example) get a socket + a decent tertiary stats I will keep taking tier tokens...<br />

That is precisely my point, it is going to be &quot;wtf no gem slot, it's garbage.&quot; unfortunately you won't know that it's garbage until after you have rolled on it, and identified it. if you can still trade it away after Cain identifies it then it's a moot point, but I somehow doubt that is going to be how it works.</div></div><hr />

So you toss it away just like you toss away current tier gear after you get your heroic peice?<br />
<br />
All this changes is that a specific piece of gear can still be an upgrade after you get the base version. So that you aren't vendoring all tier tokens 2 months into raid.<br />
<br />
The concern about a raider with a base version taking a token over another raider without tier is pedantic, no real guild has a system that supports denying a major upgrade to one player for the minor potential upgrade of another. (Top guilds use alt runs to funnel gear so again moot point)<br />
<br />
Tier gear distribution is the same as normal till everyone has at least base gear, then distriution goes to those without bonuses, different guilds might have different priorities at this point, people that only have a minor tertiary stat like run speed might get same priority as those without bonuses.<br />
<br />
<br />
People are overblowing this issue and spamming the word RNG like it supposed to mean something, RNG has always been apart of this game. Nothing has changed other than actually getting something out of the 4+ month farm you'll be doing anyway. (Unless you are in one of those awesome guilds that can take a 4 month break after progression and actually expect people to all come back for next tier and still play well, aka .0000001% of guilds)</div></div><hr />

This won't happen. All raids other than Mythic use personal loot in WoD and Mythic raid groups will almost always have a loot system / loot master just like they do now.<br />
<br />
That being said, a more Diablo-style loot system like this doesn't seem like a good idea for WoW for all the reasons already mentioned. RNG on drops is bad enough as it is without adding additional RNG to the quality of the drop as well.</div></div><hr />
