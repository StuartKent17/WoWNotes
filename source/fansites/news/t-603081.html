Patch 2.3 and Season 3 Start date<br />
We are currently planning to start Season 3 on November 20 once the realms come back up from their weekly maintenance.<br />
The start date for Season 3 is purposefully planned to be one week later than the release of patch 2.3, which is currently scheduled for November 13.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
While testing continues and a delay could possibly change these dates, we are currently planning to start Season 3 on November 20 once the realms come back up from their weekly maintenance. This means that Season 2 will come to a close when the realms come down for maintenance on November 20. During that maintenance the final standings are taken and the end of season rewards are distributed.<br />
<br />
The start date for Season 3 is purposefully planned to be one week later than the release of patch 2.3, which is currently scheduled for November 13. We will be closely monitoring the testing of the 2.3 patch, and if it looks like it won’t make the November 13 date, we will announce a delay.<br />
<br />
With the end of the current season all previous recipients of the end of season titles will have them removed, and the titles will be redistributed for participation in Season 2. A unique armored swift nether drake, visually distinguishable from the Season 1 reward, will be awarded to the top 0.5% of teams. We’ve recently added new requirements for a team to be counted when determining the top 0.5%, which can be found here: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2649798359&amp;sid=1 (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2649798359&amp;sid=1)<br />
<br />
FAQ<br />
<br />
Q: Can I keep my title from Season 1 even if I haven’t participated in Season 2?<br />
A: No, the seasonal titles are intended to be a reward for performance in the previous season. Similar to a sports title or award, it’s handed off or moved to different players/teams as their performance rises or declines throughout the seasons.<br />
<br />
Q: What happens to my Nether Drake?<br />
A: You will keep your Swift Nether Drake, and a new visually distinguishable Swift Nether Drake will be given to the top 0.5% of teams for their efforts in Season 2.<br />
<br />
Q: So I’ve heard something about items having rating requirements?<br />
A: Yes, the Season 3 weapons will have a personal rating requirement of 1850, and the shoulders will have a personal rating requirement of 2000.<br />
<br />
Q: What is a “Personal Rating”?<br />
A: We’re introducing an additional rating system with the start of Season 3 that will only track your personal games played, which you’ll be able to see through the in-game PvP interface. This rating will be used to determine the ability to buy specific items, and also to determine eligibility for the end of season rewards. The personal rating rises and declines using the same formula as the arena team rating, but only in games that you participate in. If you switch teams the rating will be reset to a default 1500. The personal rating is only used for the initial purchase of specific items, and isn't required that you maintain a rating to use them.<br />
<br />
Q: What happens to the Season 1 and 2 items?<br />
A: The Season 2 items will be priced the same as Season 1 is now, and the Season 1 items are moving to the honor system, purchasable with honor points and Battleground marks.<br />
<br />
Q: What happens to my rating when Season 2 ends?<br />
A: Ratings for all teams are reset to the default 1500 for the new season. You still keep your arena points though, they aren’t diminished or removed.<br />
<br />
Q: When does Season 2 officially end?<br />
A: Barring a delay, when the realms come down for maintenance on November 20.<br />
<br />
Q: How sure are you that 2.3 will make a November 13 release?<br />
A: Pretty sure, but there’s always the possibility for a delay. Due to the upcoming holidays any necessary delays to the release of the patch may require us to delay Season 3 into the start of December. We’re trying very hard to avoid that.<br />
<br />
Q: Why isn’t Season 3 beginning with the release of the patch?<br />
A: To help us focus on both a major content patch release, and start of a new season, we’re separating them by one week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
5 expertise = 1.25% dodge/parry reduction<br />
<br />
So yea, definately a buff to the old 5 weapon skill racials. <br />
<br />
I really wonder how Blizzard looks at racials, are they supposed to be this game defining as some of the racials are? Prot Orcs will just about reach the expertise cap by just using the BT tanking axe. <br />
<br />
5racial + 6talent + 5.33Brutalizer= 16.33 Expertise = 4% dodge/parry reduction.<br />
<br />
So an orc only needs 4expertise more (16expertise rating I think) to cap the stats.<br />
<br />
So the human/orc racial is fair enough against the tauren racial, but any other race is really gimped for prot tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes ur missing something : The personal rating is calculated with the same formula that is momentarily used for the team rating. So if ur team rating is still 1500 and ur personal rating is 1800 u wont get more then 1-5 points personal rating for a win against a 1500ish team and therefore u cant just keep playing low ranked teams. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly what I thought was going to happen. <br />
<br />
Step 1: Nerf Shamans<br />
Step 2: Say &quot;we're looking into it&quot; over and over throughout the duration of the test period<br />
Step 3: Say &quot;we'll look into changing it in a future patch&quot;<br />
<br />
It is the exact same thing they did in the patch that was supposed to be the &quot;shaman review&quot; where mages and druids got more changes than shamans. It must suck to be a shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There was never a question of human warrior vs night elf rogue. Perception + warrior &gt; rogue (rock / paper / scissors).<br />
As for warriors, when you are equally geared you will effectively still have +1% dodge as a NE over the human warrior. Granted, whether you want to be dodging a warrior or not is another question (overpower crit? 8) ).<br />
<br />
I'm not too psyched about losing 1% crit and trading it for 1.25% dodge reduction, but 1.25% parry reduction could well be worth it. Then again, together it's effective 2.5% avoidance reduction and will come in handy when switching stances to overpower is not rage / time (triggering GCD twice) efficient. Meh, we'll see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To answer your questions:<br />
1) No, you can't get it, QQ more. Now you will actually have to work for some of the stuff, big deal.<br />
2) Yes you do have to grind again. Although, you could consider it &quot;having fun&quot;, as with a good team it really is fun fighting tough teams. (Unless of course, you are getting that weapon to PvE with, then gtfo my arenas. :P )<br />
<br />
There's plenty of stuff to get until you get 1850 rating. All the armor penetration is making me happy in my pants over smacking clothies (whom it has the greatest effect on), plus I am guessing the season 2 weapons will be holding up for a while.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To answer your question - yes, if it's hard for you; no, if it's easy for you. Not entirely sure where you were going with that question. Fact is, you can't have it on the first day - the rest is up to you, stick with your s2 weapon until you can get the new one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your armor penetration is worth nothing since every stupid arena cloth has more armor then non arena mail. They added few penetration and much more armor so it is worse.<br />
<br />
And about whining Shamans, warriors are constantly nerfed since 1.3 cry more that you was nerfed and not &quot;fixed&quot; in this patch :&gt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc8ab488a50b</div><div class="date">2007-11-07, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course it's worth something, indeed it's worth very much. It's not about reducing armor to zero, it's about negating damage mitigation. The less armor you've got, the more damage mitigation you'll lose per points of ignored armor.<br />
<br />
I know Arena cloth can compete or even beat leather, but it's still in a bracket where each lost point of armor will increase physical damage by a worthwhile amount. All things considered, ignored armor will give a nice damage boost against clothies or leather wearer and a little boost vs mail and plate.</div></div><hr />

They added few penetration and much more armor so it is worse.<br />

And about whining Shamans, warriors are constantly nerfed since 1.3 cry more that you was nerfed and not &quot;fixed&quot; in this patch :&gt; <br />

They added a whopping 66 armor from s2 to s3 for priests. So with all the armor penetration, we will actually loose armor.</div></div><hr />

All the armor penetration is making me happy in my pants over smacking clothies (whom it has the greatest effect on), plus I am guessing the season 2 weapons will be holding up for a while.<br />

Armour yields a linear increase in damage reduction.</div></div><hr />
