Of Brews And Blackouts (7.2.5)<br />
One point of confusion that I've seen about the new RJW change: The tooltip isn't showing its increased damage, but the total damage per cast has gone up. The damage per tick didn't change. We'll get the tooltip fixed for the next build.

Discipline in 7.2.5<br />
As with other specs, we'd like to get some discussion early in the PTR process about our goals for any significant changes, so that people giving feedback have context for what we're expecting.<br />
<br />
First, some problems with live Discipline:<br />
--The mana cost mechanic on Plea is clumsy and makes the spell require a complex evaluation to use at all.<br />
--Relatedly, PW:Radiance is a no-cooldown Atonement applicator that is better than Plea in almost every way, and is basically limited only by total mana.<br />
--So the spec is now balanced around very high Atonement count in raids (from using Radiance as much as possible) being the only time Discipline is strong. High-end players have gotten used to this as a playstyle as well.<br />
--The spec is very dependent on mana, since more mana turning into more Radiances is virtually the only thing constraining your healing.<br />
<br />
We understand that toppling any aspect of this situation gives alarm to high-end raiders, mainly related to power level of the spec. There was one way to make the spec &quot;work&quot; in raids, and the dedicated Discipline players have learned to optimize it to get good performance. And we can probably start assuaging some concerns by saying: without using all nearly your mana on concentrated Radiance usage, and without using focused Innervates to push that even further, we understand the power level of the spec would be clearly impacted absent other changes.<br />
<br />
It is our intention to have fewer average Atonements out in raids after the patch, which will likely involve an increase to either Atonement transfer or simply to damage dealt. This, among other results, should result in an increase in power in all situations other than mass spread raid healing. And even in that situation, there's no overall reduction in power intended, other than perhaps in extreme cases of Innervate stacking. Ideally, Discipline will more regularly and stably be near that level of performance through a normal playstyle.<br />
<br />
Because the spec is so complex, there will surely a lot of tuning of mana costs and damage amounts and the like throughout PTR, to get everything into the right place. But for some further goals on the changes that are in so far:<br />
--The damage increase is on Smite (I believe this PTR build only has a small damage increase, but the internal build has a much larger one) moreso than Penance. So that your incentive is not to spam out as many Atonements as possible and then convert them to healing with Penance. A decision of more Atonements vs. more damage should be more relevant than it is now, when more Atonements are essentially always right.<br />
--For similar reasons, reducing mana costs to free up overall mana on the spec was done to Smite rather than Plea. Smite should never feel wrong to cast, whereas shifting to cast a heal spell is an expenditure of mana to get an Atonement, very similar to any heal on a typical healer.<br />
--PW:R going to more, shorter Atonements rather than fewer, longer Atonements is to allow a quick payoff on a lot of targets (5 or 10) through a Penance and some Smites. Cases such as group damage in dungeon healing should have a tool that's a smoother fit for them now.<br />
<br />
These details are very much open to feedback like anything else, but the main point at the outset is: we're very aware we're poking at the one trick of a spec that is a bit of a one-trick pony in raids. And that requires making sure that all the other parts of the toolkit are up to snuff in the same process. Our hope is that it's not only a clear upgrade for everyone outside the high-end raid setting, but also that those players have a less degenerate and more varied rotation while still performing at the right level.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the post. Any thoughts on making penance heal untalented again? IMO the spec is way hard to play in most situations for the average player. I found myself having a hard time keeping up tanks spike damage in 5 mans, even when out gearing the content.<br />
This is in the current PTR build--Penance can be used in either mode baseline.<br />
<br />
Also, the problem of the time used to apply Radiances is an issue, because the casting time has to be considered into how long you actually get to make use of those Atonements.<br />
Yes, the current cast time and duration might be a little constrained--both are potential things to look at as we see how it plays out. The payoff from a PWR shouldn't feel like it's overly conditioned on getting an exact sequence of a few spells with no interruption.<br />
<br />
Yeah, sure, makes sense, except one crucial point... you removed the Smite absorb per-cast. That was the one feature about the spell that actually favored having fewer Atonements. A Smite that heals 5 people now does actually even less healing than before, and while it's nice and all that it costs almost no mana, it's the time constraint on Disc now to actually cast Smite that creates a problem. <br />
It's true that works against lower-Atonement healing somewhat. Overall this effect should work as a talent since it's somewhat situational in a way that contrasts nicely to Castigation, but there could be something different here if it becomes a problem. The Penitent is definitely better baseline since it's an option that is rarely a net power increase to use, but allows some important convenience/flexibility in some cases. <br />
<br />
Lack of mana is not why Smite is not cast. Smite is not cast because by the time you're done doing everything else in the spec that costs a GCD, nobody with Atonement is still damaged unless you're on a fight that has literally constant damage every second from start to finish or your fellow healers are really, really bad at the game.<br />
If nobody in the raid is damaged, then basically no healer has anything to do other than 1) set up something like a HoT (analogy: apply an Atonement), or 2) do some damage. So that's not unusual, and favors making sure that Smite is near-free or free and the mana decisions are on applying the heals (Atonements).

<br />
Check the comic yourself before making claims: Shalamayne sits on the desk Anduin is at. How did he get it in the comic if not until AFTER this event in-game? He is not reading about his father's death at the start, more like a standard royal missive of some sort, reflecting on his father's passing and how he became king, not in the way he had hoped as a boy.<br />
<br />
The comic takes place after this cinematic, though before the end of the events on the Broken Isles (as the guard-turned-demon brings word about the Broken Isles before attacking). The offensive we are on is still active, the Tomb is likely not yet dealt with. But the event of this cinematic scene, is done. Anduin has been to the Broken Shore, taken up Shalamayne, and returned to Stormwind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This cinematic is clearly way after that... hence the inconsistency with the weapon being 'found'.<br />
<br />
How is something that simple confusing?</div></div><hr />

Anduin is the king of Stormwind, I don't understand what neutrality you imagine. And if that cinematic confirms anything it is that he will stand for his people.</div></div><hr />

Lets see, like, just as an exercise of judgement, nothing serious:<br />
<br />
Vanilla wow, nothing for no one. A 1 - 1 H<br />
BC: mainly bloodelfs, so lets give it to the horde. A 1 - 2 H<br />
WtoLK: Arthas and Paladins, pretty much alliance. A 2 - 2 H<br />
Cata: Thrall our lord and savior, does it ALL, horde. A 2 - 3 H <br />
MoP: Thrall goes fishing or something a bit, Anduin rises, alliance. A 3 - 3 H<br />
WoD: Thrall meets his parents, rest does not really matter cuz cute, horde. A 3 - 4 H<br />
Legion: Illidan's story, mainly Night-elves, alliance. A 4 - 4 H<br />
<br />
I'd like to keep on the night-elves story line because it's far more interesting to me.</div></div><hr />

You're delusional.<br />
<br />
LK: Was mostly balanced. Paladins are not alliance. Horde hero gets to show everyone how awesome the horde is when he turns bad guy. Alliance hero turns into an NPC you don't do shit with.<br />
<br />
MoP: Garrosh Garrosh Garrosh. Oh there's alliance here? Lol.<br />
<br />
Legion: Horde get to stick it to the alliance again while they sit there and take it. Balanced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the comic is set after this happened, not months ago before varian even died<br />
<br />
Except the Dreadlords trying to infiltrate Stormwind (shown in the comic) happened before the Alliance and Horde went back to the Broken Isles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Comic 100% Likely happened after the cinematic...<br />
<br />
Hence why the Demon knows of Anduin's BS....<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
We know exactly when it was, he was getting the letter telling him his father had died and his belongings. So it was well before he comes out here.<br />
<br />
Could say the same thing about the cinematic, as well:<br />
<br />
Genn: Oh, anduin. Forgot to show you something, just a little gift for before we depart. It's a letter Varian gave me. He told me to send it to you. However, I was so blind-sided by the horde, that I kind of forgot to give it to you...<br />
<br />
Anduin: Thanks, Genn. I'll read it when we get back...<br />
<br />
Legion Demons: So, the boy is following the path of the Wolf. It's only a matter of time before the prophecy becomes true, and BOTH The Demon hunter, as well as the King dis-assemble our Crusade....<br />
<br />
Dreadlord: Allow me to deal with him, I know how to take him on....<br />
<br />
Kil'jaeden: Do not fail me, Dreadlord.<br />
<br />
Dreadlord: Your will be done, master.<br />
<br />
*Comic Happens right after*<br />
<br />
Would make sense...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This cinematic is clearly way after that... hence the inconsistency with the weapon being 'found'.<br />
<br />
How is something that simple confusing?<br />
<br />
Yet if you read the comic again he is reminiscing his father's final words to him before he even opens the scroll he has in his hands. Even stating word for word &quot;I've not forgotten your final words, father. I've carried them with me since the day I became king...&quot;<br />
<br />
That happens before the scroll is unsealed, so if the scroll contains and is informing Anduin of Varian's final words to him, how can he be thinking of Varian's final words as he unseals it?<br />
<br />
Combine that with the last part of his thought &quot;I've carried them with me since the day I became king...&quot; and you can draw that he has known Varian's words since his coronation from Prince to King, yet the soldier/dreadlord that walks in and addresses him as &quot;My King&quot;, which why would he address him as &quot;My King&quot; rather than &quot;My Prince&quot; if he is yet to find out about his father which would lead to his coronation as King.<br />
<br />
It's obvious he knew and recieved the letter from Greymane well and truly before the comic happens, and he is reading just a generic scroll containing any kind of information that a King would need to be made aware of, as the real kicker to it all. Varian's letter is sealed by blue wax in both the legion cinematic and broken shore cinematic, the one he is opening in the comic is a reddish brown.<br />
<br />
So it's the comic doesn't happen immediately following the failed assault on the Broken Shore and given the presence of Shalamayne on the desk would place it happening after this quest as there is zero evidence to suggest otherwise.</div></div><hr />

It was sorta reflected in the pre-Legion event, although in the ingame version, it was an Illidari who revealed the dreadlord.<br />
<br />
This is just Blizzard going &quot;Oh, it'd be cool to have him find the weapon in the Broken Shore&quot; while forgetting about out-of-game material.</div></div><hr />

those wernt the same dreadlord. you seem to be claiming you know the lore better then they do, because you have a fan cannon where X happens, even though Y makes perfect sense and is what the creaters of the lore are saying hapepned &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

By neutral I mean a character that still wants peace between the Horde and Alliance. As the leader of the humans I would expect him to put his people first but I hope he doesnt harbor anger towards the Horde due to them leaving the fight on the broken shore and tries to start some shit.</div></div><hr />

This, Anduin only recovers half of the sword at the Broken shore , the other half could perfectly have been the one he has on the comics</div></div><hr />
