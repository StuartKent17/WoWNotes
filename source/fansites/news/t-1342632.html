<br />
Visions of Time - One Final Turn<br />
Patch 5.4 added a quest line on the Timeless Isle that involves working for Kairoz (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/72870-kairoz) of the Keepers of Time (http://wowpedia.org/Keepers_of_Time). He is on the Timeless Isle because the Bronze Dragonflight is not as powerful as it once was, only being able to catch furtive glimpses through time. He has created an hourglass that will allow for a window into the timeways, but you must collect 50 x Epoch Stones (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/105715-epoch-stone) to make it usable. <br />
<br />
After collecting the stones, you embark on a series of weekly quests to use the Vision of Time (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/105930-vision-of-time) in different locations to calibrate the Vision of Time. Kairoz eventually will reveal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33376-seeking-fate) that there is a traitor among the Bronze Dragonflight.<br />
<br />
As the hourglass grows more powerful, he will finally send you (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/33379-one-final-turn) to the Caverns of Time to see Soridormi (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/55395-soridormi) die, which is the scene you see below. <br />

Flex Raiding Update<br />
You can now resume a Flex Raid based on the leader's progress rather than the least progressed player's progress.<br />
Once again, this community has come together in a constructive manner to share feedback and suggestions, and we thank you for that. Let's kick this update off with the most recent change:<br />
<br />
After careful consideration of the feedback you've shared, and after weighing pros and cons of the Flex mode system that came with Patch 5.4, we've decided to change how raid progress is saved. At patch launch, entering Flex mode SoO was based upon who had progressed the least. For example, a raid of 11 players entered SoO and downed 3 bosses on Tuesday night. Wednesday night, all 11 come back together to continue but decide to bring along 4 new people. If the raid had queued together, they'd have had to start the raid over from the beginning because those 4 new players weren't flagged as having downed the first 3 bosses. Our original intent was to err on the side of making sure no one in the raid would miss out on a boss that they still needed to kill.<br />
<br />
A hotfix applied this morning, however, takes a more traditional approach to raid lockouts by basing boss progression on the group leader's status. In other words, if the raid leader faced 3 bosses on Tuesday and decides to continue where he or she left off tonight, anyone who joins the Flex raid--even those who have never set foot into SoO--will begin the instance at the same point where the raid leader finished on Tuesday. This system is more straightforward and understandable for much of the WoW raiding community, therefore Flexible raids will no longer be based upon the least progressed member.<br />
<br />
Thanks, but there seem to be some folks that haven't seen it work like this if cross-realm players are involved. Is this a bug / user error?<br />
This was addressed in this morning's hotfixes.<br />
<br />
Question, does flex reward loot like lfr does, ie random number roller, or is their actual gear to be handed out?<br />
Is there any reason why we need to queue in the first place?<br />
These two questions go hand-in-hand: Using Raid Finder-style loot ensures that adding new players to a Flexible raid will never impact any individual member’s chances of receiving loot. And using Raid Finder-style loot also means using Raid Finder-style queuing.<br />
<br />
Will players who are skipped ahead this way still be eligible for loot from bosses they skipped if they join another flex raid with those bosses up, like LFR, or will it be like normal/heroic where you have to accept the raid leader's progression and match their lockout status to raid together?<br />
Yes. If you joined &quot;Flex Raid Group A&quot; to help down the fourth boss after they had already killed the first three, you could then join &quot;Flex Raid Group B&quot; to down the first three bosses later and be eligible for loot. Of course, if you continued on to the fourth boss for a second time, you would not be eligible for loot.<br />
<br />
It should be noted that no matter what, you'll always receive Valor Points for every boss you kill in Flex Siege of Orgrimmar regardless of how many times you've killed them that week. Also, if you have the Warforged Seals, you can continue to use them for bonus rolls each time a boss is defeated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4 Hotfixes: September 13<br />

Connected Realms<br />
Most people on PvP realms like having a faction advantage and choose their server or move to servers specifically for that reason, which makes evening it out fairly difficult. There also tends to be a faction imbalance on PvP vs. PvE realms, where PvP realms tend to be Horde heavy and PvE tend to be Alliance heavy. So when we connect a few low-pop PvP realms together it's somewhat likely to only be able to be matching imbalanced realms with imbalanced realms. Considering the desire for a faction advantage, even if we did achieve a balance I'm honestly not sure how long it would last. In any case, with Connected Realms both sides will be getting more players, and bringing up the amount of people on each realm is the goal.<br />
<br />
Connected Realms are a complex process, we have a lot of data, we're taking our time, and we're taking a lot of factors into account to provide the best possible end-result we can. Faction balance is one of those factors, but it's definitely far more nuanced a problem.<br />
<br />
What about the people that chose their server based on a small population, only to have CRZ shoved down our throats? <br />
World of Warcraft is a Massively Multiplayer Online Game. While you and I can disagree and discuss that being on a PvP realm with more of one faction or the other vs. a balanced realm is more or less fun for each of us, the game world being full of people is the definition of the type of game this is (MMO) and arguing it's more fun to have less people in it just doesn't align with the basic intentions of the game. It may be the way you prefer to play, and that's fine, but it's the opposite of what the game is defined as, and therefore isn't going to be something that we're specifically taking care to preserve.<br />
<br />
Where were all the blues when there were tons of threads by people on dead realms complaining that their MMO experience wasn't really an MMO experience and more of a single player game?<br />
Reassuring them we were aware it was an issue, working on Connected Realms, waiting until most of the engineering work had been completed so we were sure it could be done, and then announcing it.<br />
<br />
I can only speak for myself but I feel like a lot of the connected realms information is just really vague. For example, why not have a list of exactly which realms are connected to which other realms? That just seems logical to me.<br />
That is logical, but there are no Connected Realms at this time and no list to share. We've announced the first ones we'll be using the process on, but don't yet have a date when that will be done. Once that's done though we'll certainly let everyone know what the plans are moving forward. <br />

Gemming and Enchanting Gear<br />
I get ya, and I pass on gems and enchants for crappier gear sometimes, buuuuuuuut 502 I'd personally say you should be gemming and enchanting. You're clearly OK with spending Valor on upgrading the items that you think are crap, and for me Valor is more valuable than a few hundred gold. Maybe don't buy the best gems, or necessarily get all the enchants, but at least make an effort. Encounters and game difficulty is balanced around the ilvl of your gear, and the ilvl of your gear is balanced around the inclusion of (at least) gems. The ilvl of an item determines a stat budget, and that stat budget is spent on literal stats (+Str/Int/etc.) but also sockets, so if you leave those sockets open you're making your gear a lot worse than it's intended to be for that ilvl. Buy some cheaper gems, get some of the cheaper enchants, be a little better, done.<br />
<br />
I obviously gotta work on my gold making.<br />
Not having any professions might be hurting you a bit in that regard, either needing to pay for everything, and/or not being able to sell anything of your own gathering/creation.<br />
<br />
And the good weapon enchants all sell for several thousand gold and I can't afford to pick up a new one every single time I get a new weapon.<br />
That's why I don't buy the best enchants every time. Determine how long you think you'll have that item, and base your investment on that.<br />
<br />
So you just made two professions (enchanting and Jewelcrafting) mandatory for everyone. If you are tuning for gear around enchants and gems then how about having a vendor available with cheap gems and enchants?<br />
We tune around assumptions of gearing and ability with a wide range of item levels and skill for the various content difficulties throughout the game. Whether someone buys all the best gems and enchants or doesn't use any, we have to tune for something, and where that tuning is depends on the type of person that content is targeted at.<br />
<br />
Expecting people to interact with one another to achieve goals in an MMO isn't a far-out notion, and I would say is at the core of what the game is. The fact that you don't have to physically go to another player to achieve a lot of these actions is already freeing you from the weighty burdens of having to (ew) talk to other humans, but asking for them to be completely removed from any kind of player interaction and just put on a vendor... I have to ask, what are your expectations of this game?

Connected Realms Update<br />
Soo, any eta when we are going to get a list of those realms already connected? When the restart started this morning, I got 2 messages as of the 5 minute mark: Connected realm restart in ?? and Realm restart in ??<br />
<br />
Does that mean Lightbringer is now connected to another server? <br />
Realms aren't connected as of yet. What you're seeing is some of the work that needs to be done in order to begin making connections.

We’re looking into a number of potential new ways to answer common questions and get more information to you about the game. We thought what better way to test them out than with actual questions from you, our loyal General Forum goers?<br />

There is not a gem on my server that sells for more than 100g. I have been holding a stack of all the most popular gems for a month waiting for the price to get that high so I can sell them.. I am thinking I will have them til the next expac... You really can´t afford to gem the few upgrades you get each week. Couple tips.. first off, look for perfect cut commons, they are exactly the same stats. If you are really that poor, you just need to learn how to handle your money better...at 90, 75g for a gem is nothing.<br />

I wonder if the traitor is the draenei child from Children's week, finally doing whatever it is she was going to do in the future. Dunno if anyone recalls, but the draenei child was almost cut to pieces by the guards when you fulfill her request to see the COT. I THINK it was Soridormi who stopped the dragon's from killing her, saying that the child will not have to answer for &quot;what she has done, or what she fails to do in the future&quot; until it happens.<br />
<br />
Speculating. Hmmmm!!<br />
<br />
The orc child from horde side has the same thing happen.. Wasn´t there a bad movie a few years ago about something like that?</div></div><hr />

Graphics and hardware have NOTHING to do with if it's in next gen or not.<br />
<br />
Launch dates in NA for 7th gen consoles:<br />
<br />
Xbox 360: 16. nov 2005<br />
PS3: 11. nov 2006<br />
Wii: 19. nov 2006<br />
<br />
So by your logic, Xbox 360 is not part of the 7th gen.<br />
<br />
Can you see how stupid and uninformed you are?<br />

Wii U is and currently is the only 8th gen console on the market.</div></div><hr />

No need to get defensive I'm just trying to shed a bit of understanding on MMO-C's part. I'm just saying Wii U has set themselves out of the console war this go around so the really only interesting contest is between PS4 and XBONE the PC option there just kind of baits people into a pointless argument like this.</div></div><hr />

Well if you look at 7th gen, there is a huuuge leap in hardware power from the Wii to the PS360. There is a lesser leap from Wii U to PS One.<br />
And the Wii sold way more than PS3 and Xbox 360. So I don't see how you can come to the conclusion that they set themselves out of the console war.<br />
If anything, they are the one who enters the 8th gen and starts it.<br />
<br />
But in anyway. PC+Wii U for 8th gen. Most to all games that will be out for the PS One also comes for the PC, so why even buy one of those. They are just cheaper, weaker PC with the same games. Wii U however got lots of great exclusives.</div></div><hr />

Nope and its a PS4 not a PS one....and Sony has made it a point to make more brand new Exclusives for there consoles....Nintendo keeps making the expected games over and over and over.</div></div><hr />

I say PS One instead of saying PS4 + Xbox One.<br />
<br />
Of course Nintendo keeps making new Mario, Zelda and Donkey Kong. They sell a lot and are expected on a Nintendo console.<br />
<br />
And don't be stupid. Most to all Sony exclusives are shit and not worth to buy a PS4 for. I can see you rather want a PS4 over a Xbox One, but the exclusives is not a part of it.<br />
<br />
And Nintendo also pumps out new IP's. They just get over shadowed by their old IP's.</div></div><hr />

Kinda smart getting out of all this PS4 VS XBoX stuff, Nintendo knows once their games are out they will sell shitloads of consoles, everyone will have a Wii U second to their other choice.</div></div><hr />

I think you need to do some research. The difference in power between Wii U and PS4/XBOne is far bigger than the difference in the 7th generation. They also chose to stick with the PowerPC architecture as opposed to switching to x64 like MS and Sony. Those two things mean multi-platform games are far less likely to appear on the Wii U (many 3rd party studios have already said they want nothing to do with it) meaning all Nintendo has to fall back on are it's first party exclusives. While those will ensure they do OK, doing ok is never a goal of any business.<br />
<br />
As far as games not being exclusive to consoles and coming out on PC, either you live under a rock or haven't been a PC gamer very long. We (PC Gamers) miss out on a TON of games. When's the last time you saw a high profile jRPG PC release? How about the Uncharted series, God of War, Gears of War, Halo... I can go on and on for days.</div></div><hr />

Nintendo haven't relied on 3rd party since NES and SNES days. And they had almost monopoly on the market back then.<br />
People buy a Nintendo console for Nintendo games, and take 3rd party games as a bonus. It's not like PS or Xbox where 3rd party runs their systems are their exclusives doesn't do much in the whole.<br />
<br />
I own a Wii U and I have no intent to buy a game which also comes for PC. I want it for Nintendo exclusives, like every other Nintendo console I've owned.<br />
<br />
Also, Activision, Ubisoft and some more I can't remember are still going to support Wii U. Even Fifa even comes for it, even tho EA said they would have nothing to do with Nintendo, and it will also get CoD. So it really is just people making it sound like the Wii U will get nothing but 1st party support and indie devs.</div></div><hr />

To what you said earlier, Nintendo has always been apart of the console war EXCEPT maybe this generation when they decided to release their console a year before the other guys.<br />
<br />
Just to settle your mind a bit, I do own a Wii U and so far I'm less than satisfied with it only because the games I'm interested in aren't coming until the next few months/year. I do think Nintendo will raise some competition with the titles coming out this November/December that will surely leave people deciding between Wii U games and the other guys' next gen console. In fact, I actually believe Nintendo will outsell Sony and MS because of the strategy they used.<br />
<br />
I just think they broke tradition by releasing the console a year early with average launch titles and this sort of took them out of the &quot;war&quot;.</div></div><hr />

All consoles have a slow start when it comes to games and sold units. Just look at the PS3. It started out with nothing, but it ended well in the end.<br />
<br />
Also for games for the Wii U. I currently own Pikmin 3, Wonderful 101 (can really recommend it!) and Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. As for MH3U. This game man. This game. It blew me away sideways. First MH game and I couldn't stop playing it. I got it right around when ToT came out, and I stopped playing WoW for a few months just to play MH3U.<br />
<br />
And I think it was a good idea for them to start out with the console a year early. It kinda of pushed Sony and M$ to release new consoles. And by the time The Xbox One and PS4 is out, the Wii U will have a really great line up of games.<br />
Just look at the line up of games that will be out for the Christmas sale.<br />
<br />
Wii U IS part of the 8th gen no matter what people say. Hardware power doesn't dictate if a console is in #gen or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think PS4 is better but I don't yet trust their online. That's what next-gen needs to be about really. It needs to be able to compete with the PC in multiplayer scale but eliminate all those technical issues that are frustrating to less PC savvy people. After playing Rome Total War 2 with my PC and seeing the bad performance I'm getting (and many other do) I can really see the advantages of the consoles if they can perform at PC level.<br />
<br />
I voted for stick with PC. I'll see how it goes over few months after all inevitable issues are ironed out then I might get one.</div></div><hr />

Wii had Zelda at launch which I'm pretty sure was what boosted sales until it came out on Gamecube later. I'm just hoping that the holiday releases will be as good as Wii's year-later releases (Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3). We will be getting New Super Mario 3D World (not too excited about SMG2-style non-open world) in November and SSMB and MK8 sometime in 2014. These are really the only titles I'm excited about. Nintendo has yet to announce a new Zelda title for Wii U nor a Metroid title (hasn't even been one for 3DS yet). Overall I'm sort of disappointed. MK7 was a disappointment, NSMB titles are getting stale, Zelda SS was disappointing, and Other M was disappointing. I'm really hoping something is being done about the quality of their recent games at Nintendo. Admittedly, Super Mario 3D World was good and very replayable, but that's considering that its a portable game. If the Wii U version is on this level (same style and gameplay) then I will be sorely disappointed. Was there something wrong with the completely 3D environment in Sunshine and Galaxy 1?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant.</div></div><hr />

The Zelda U was actually done enough to be shown at E3. But Nintendo was afraid it would take the spotlight away from WW:HD and all the other games. And it would have. It's maybe the most exciting upcoming title(together with Smash) for Wii U. So expect a trailer or some info for it soon.<br />
<br />
I doubt we will see a new Metroid for some time. DKCR outsold several Metroid games, together, so I don't expect a new Metroid atleast until a few years.</div></div><hr />

I've got a Wii, 3DS and modded 360 and I hardly play any of them. Mostly because I feel like I have a duty to play WoW because I'm an officer in my guild. lol &gt;.&gt;; but if I'm going to get a new console then I'm going with the Ouya. $99 for an open source Linux based game console that's so hackable, easily runs a media center and is running a full Android OS which means it's simply a computer. It may not be as powerful as the Big Name consoles but it's free. It's yours to do what you please and already has hundreds of games in it's libraries plus emulators.<br />
I don't like anything those big companies are doing. Sure, many of the games released for their consoles are great but the developers can work for different platforms where less shady and evil practices go on. Let's support something by mostly average people for regular people.</div></div><hr />

I heard something about alot of harddisk space is required, that's something I don't know anything about but to me it sounds more logical with less realms goes less &quot;harddrive space&quot;.
