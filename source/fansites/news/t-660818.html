Val'anyr Hotfixed<br />
We managed to get in a hotfix today that allows periodic healing ticks that were going to overheal entirely to go ahead and fire. Previously they did not fire. This means that effects that were able to proc from HoT ticks that did some healing can now also proc from HoT ticks that overheal completely. The most notable such effect is that Val'anyr's absorb shield should now work as advertised. All these ticks should now appear in the combat log as well, allowing you to get a fuller sense of your raw healing output from all sources.<br />
<br />
Sorry that we did not comment before now. Given the nature of the bug, we didn't want to promise anything until we were sure we could fix it. <br />

On the bright side, it sounds like a number of Trinkets will look slightly better for Druids as a result of this change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1) it would be a minuscule amount of threat anyway, even on AoE pulls (healing threat is split among mobs in range).<br />
<br />
2) overhealing doesn't cause threat<br />
<br />
So you're both uninformed and wrong, please sit down.<br />

It's hilarious to see them fix this so quickly after 4 years of a stupid mechanic. Now we can see what the true healing output of a druid is (fucking ridiculous), I hope they nerf it.</div></div><hr />

I reported this bug on the PTR and could never fix it. I tried going to all the continents, fresh wow install with no addons, even a different computer. It annoyed me so much that i stopped using the PTR. I feel sorry for you, it it really annoying.</div></div><hr />

lol, it's insane how much we overheal now. I did a 10man ulduar (razor, xrhard,kolo,cat lady, and mim) I managed to do almost I think 9mil healing and 10mil+ over heals<br />
<br />
on a smaller scale in heroic toc: 700k heals with 1mil overheal.<br />
<br />
You warlocks think your little fel armor spam is bad? Try seeing every hot tick on at least 10+ people at once.</div></div><hr />

Except most mods allow you to filter output, so any display of healing he doesn't like is totally inconsequential to the community. I have two setups for my characters: Healers use one that displays everything, non-healers use one that doesn't display any overheals. Simple. If you wanted to MSBT can even specifically filter out Fel Armor overheals, or just filter Fel Armor entirely. It's only a 'problem' if you're using the built in pseudo-SCT that Blizzard added back in like 2.3, or something.</div></div><hr />

I think this hotfix was inspired by my dilemma. I made a King's Amber for the Cardinal Ruby quest about an hour after our guild had completed our raid that day, but forgot that I was still in the raid group.<br />
<br />
I opened a respectful ticket admitting my fault, and waited patiently for 3 days. The GMs didn't have the ability to advance my objective counter, so I think they just wanted to make sure this didn't happen to everyone else.</div></div><hr />
