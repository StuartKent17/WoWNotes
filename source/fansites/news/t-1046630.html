Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
Even though hard drive prices have come down slightly, now is still a good time to buy a SSD, as the next generation is a good while away and the current prices are fairly flat (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/december/ssdgraph.gif). <br />
<br />
AMD's Bulldozer arrived last month to negative reviews (http://www.anandtech.com/show/4955/the-bulldozer-review-amd-fx8150-tested), citing excessive power usage and heat output and very poor single threaded performance. They are working on another stepping which may help the problem slightly, but don't expect any significant improvements on the design until the middle of 2012 with the arrival of Piledriver. There is a glimmer of hope for those of you who purchased one and play games however, a software patch that increases gaming performance by fixing some of the scheduling issues is coming in January. <br />
<br />
New mid range AMD GPUs are rumored to be coming in Q1 2012 if you are thinking about upgrading. The new higher end 7900 parts will be here in January, with a press event and NDA lift possibly later this week.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

Really. Believe me. <br />

My taste is the overall taste so I know what people like and they do not like SW:ToR. If people play Star Wars then they'er against my rules and so the servers shall get struck by a lightning.What Daily Blink does is digital blasphemy. Stop this or you will suffer the wrath of the Fan King. <br />
The last time someone descended from the MMO throne he was kicked from Godsole - you know him as Satan (or Darth Evader). He broke the first rule which clearly says: You shall not have any other taste than mine and mine will be the taste of all.<br />

Not sure about just the gold from mobs but maybe it will be easy for blizz to give pets a &quot;use&quot; other than the future pet pvp thing. They could make them like the engineering Loot-A-Rang.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats so true. Star Wars is five thousand times more popular than WoW. Blind hatred for anything other than WoW with the word MMO associated with it is dumb, just FYI.<br />
<br />
Back on topic though. I really really really hope that the Chromatic Drake and pet are going to be gotten in game and not from the Blizzard store like so many people think. I mean I guess I'd be okay if the pet is in the store, a bit miffed but not as angry as I would be should they put that mount in the store. You can clearly see they put a lot of time and attention to this mount/pet which they rarely do with pets/mounts now a days. So to go to the level of detail they did with this just to put it in the store would be such a slap in the face. I mean Blizzard has to wonder why they're losing hundreds of thousands of subs every quarter and doing things like putting these mounts/pet in the store could be a large factor of it. <br />
<br />
I know one person who really did quit when Blizzard first opened up the Blizzard store because he was so enraged. I think quitting over it is a bit much, but I can now see what he was afraid of. I still wouldn't quit WoW over it because I love WoW, but it's really really annoying.<br />
<br />
This is all just hypothetical talk though. There's no proof this pet and it's mount brother will be sold in the store thankfully. I'm betting that one or both of them will be a reward for the Chromatic Champion achievement in Dragon Soul. The one to defeat Deathwing starting on each different ledge one time. That makes the most sense with it's name and such. Then again they could put it in for some special in game pre-Pandaria event. I also would not be surprised to see a Halion style raid come in before MoP and have this be a drop from there. Like they still haven't done anything with that dragon in the book that was made from every aspect and has 5 heads, each one being the color of their respective aspects. That would make sense to have us fight him and for him to drop the mount/pet.<br />
<br />
Who knows though</div></div><hr />

Time to what, not have login queues for a game that they actually had a level of control over the server/population ratio during the head start?<br />
<br />
Not trying to hate here, but there are already network management issues creeping up that those of us whom did the beta warned them about. So much for that whole &quot;tiered access&quot; thing they were planning.</div></div><hr />

At about 12:59ish you can see the dragon in the massive ball of yellow. It's much clearer in game but you still won't see it unless you're looking for it. Take a look next time you kill him, fairly sure it's that model.</div></div><hr />

That's just a spell animation to make it look nicer. Or you could even say it was a physical representation of the dragon soul's power, such as with Aveena being the embodiment of the Sunwell but that was only thanks to the amazing power of the well plus the help of Krasus. The Dragon Soul is not so much on the same level.</div></div><hr />

You do know that when you start to overclock the FX-8150 chips, you get substantially more performance out of it over an Intel i7 overclock, and like usual AMD dominates in multithreaded applications which in the next year or so will matter more as more and more games make use of multicore technology (as to why everything is designed around single threads is beyond me, lazy developers I guess). Stock speeds the 8150 falls short against the i7 2600k, but overclocked at 4.5Ghz it puts it on the level with a stock i7. I'd think that if you could get it around 6Ghz or so the i7 would look inferior even while overclocked to it's max.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the sad thing is that AMD did a good job with their chip set this time around for the initial model. Even the 6100 is pretty solid. The hate is coming from a very volitile viral marketing campaign against them. It started the second the first Passmark tests were released. Tests that were on the wrong MB with terribad RAM, coupled with software not ready for how these things are optimized.<br />
<br />
Luckily, people aren't buying into it and the chips are selling at a good clip. The masses are sick of handing Intel a check every two to three years for over priced, hamstrung, underperforming CPUs that can easily work even more amazing than they already do, if they'd just uncuff them.</div></div><hr />
