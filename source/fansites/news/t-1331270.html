<br />
It could be anything, but it could also be the next WoW expansion. With Gamescom coming up in a couple of days, we could also be looking at the name of the next Diablo 3 expansion. <br />
<br />
In any case, it looks like it's time to jump on the speculation train until we can get our hands on more information.<br />

The only way I could see it reasonably fitting WoW would be an Azjol-Nerub expansion, which would probably have a different name anyway.<br />
<br />
Edit: Now that I've slept for the first time in days. I recall Ozumat having a title referring to the Dark Below. Interesting.</div></div><hr />

Seems pretty obvious to me. Well, the fact that it's the name of WoW's next expansion I mean, I don't really what it is he's referring to. I assume it's the Twisting Nether, but could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes sense but they said they'd announce something at Gamescon that would change things in heaven and hell and since Gamescon is getting closer it makes sense that they'd register Diablo 3 expansion before WoW.</div></div><hr />

with D3's RMAH, I don't think it applies here. I'm leaning towards WoW. we shall see. I'm not exactly sure where this will go... could it mean we finally get to the... pardon the pun &quot;heart of the matter&quot; concerning the Old gods?</div></div><hr />

Obviously they've probably already printed the signs for their booth, their merchandise, etc.<br />
<br />
Remember, if they waited so long to register their trademark on this, all it would take is a very unscrupulous person to register it out from under them, and then they have a problem.<br />
<br />
No, this is something you do months in advance. If it's true that this was just registered... it's not for D3, if such an expansion is being unveiled at Gamescom.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not confirmed that it's tied to the Burning Legion. They came from the Twisting Nether which is UP, this is implying that it is DOWN. They only when I can see that this is Burning Legion is if it's under Outland or another new planet. I would love a Burning Legion expansion though. That's what I've been waiting for.</div></div><hr />

We never paid any heed to the ancient prophecies...like fools we clung to the old hatreds...and fought as we had for generations. Until the day the sky rained fire, and a new enemy came upon us. We stand now, upon the brink of destruction, for the reign of chaos has come at last.</div></div><hr />

The Dark Below sounds like a pretty underwhelming name for a D3 expansion, as for WoW, well after an expansion named &quot;pandaria&quot;, nothing is out of bounds anymore.</div></div><hr />

Also, Diablo fell down from Heaven.. so could be a reference to him (or her if you will..) stirring up something new down there.<br />
Or just a reference to Hell..</div></div><hr />

Again, I have a difficult time believing that they'd wait until only a week and a few days before Gamescom to register a trademark. I believe it's for WoW.</div></div><hr />

It will go back to the &quot;dark on the surface&quot; theme that was present in TBC/WOTLK/Cata. <br />
Wait! I am... I am not your enemy. You are powerful, more powerful than he was, even... perhaps you are right. Perhaps there is still hope.<br />
But there is a yawning chasm of darkness beneath you mortals, vast, endless, and all consuming. I do not believe that you can correct this doomed course.<br />
But you have earned the right to try. Farewell.<br />
<br />
Hints that it could be a D3 expansion: The Black Soulstone survived falling from the High Heavens, if you watched the cinematic. The old Archangel of Wisdom still wanders the wastes, so he would be a potential villain candidate when he finds out Tyrael has taken his place. Adria still exists after betraying us. All of these could be potential villains for the next expansion. We'll see at Gamescom for this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just found on WoWPedia, idk if it's reliable but it comes from a warcraft roleplaying game called &quot;Warcraft: Manual of Monsters&quot;, released in 2003. <br />
<br />
Also on WoWwiki:<br />
The demons from the Dark Below apparently exist apart from the Burning Legion, who reside in the Twisting Nether. The Dark Below may be another description for the &quot;Twisting Nether&quot;, in which case these are demons of a separate faction that live within the same plane of existence. This would explain how player warlocks are able to summon demons that do not serve the Legion. <br />
<br />
Further research shows that this is ALSO linked to Warcraft I, and to a lesser extent Warcraft II+III.<br />
<br />
Their belief system was later revised to the philosophy of the Holy Light. The realm from which demons are summoned was originally referred to as Hell, Hades, and the underworld, as opposed to the Twisting Nether. This is not a true retcon as later sources confirm the existence of hell, although it is synonymous with the Twisting Nether, which goes by many titles. Hell as one of its names has been referenced in later sources.<br />
<br />
In Warcraft I, and to a lesser extent Warcraft II &amp; Warcraft III, and in the novels, Day of the Dragon specifically, the terms &quot;hell&quot;, &quot;hells&quot;, &quot;Hades&quot;, &quot;lower planes&quot;, &quot;the underworld&quot;, &quot;damnation&quot;,, &quot;pit of darkness&quot; and &quot;Dark Below&quot; are used in a very traditional sense.<br />
<br />
It is still extremely possible with this many links between &quot;The Dark Below&quot; and the Twisting Nether that we could have a Burning Legion expansion, and theres no reason why Azshara can't also be involved in that expansion, considering her previous links to the Legion.<br />
<br />
Blizzard may have also copyrighted this title, as a title such as &quot;Rise of the Legion&quot; etc, is much too obvious. This title is a bit indirect, and links to multiple things.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard just trademarked &quot;The Dark Below&quot; and it definitely looks like it has something to do with a new game or expansion! <br />
<br />
<br />
Computer game software; Computer game software downloadable from a global computer network; Downloadable computer game software via a global computer network and wireless devices; Downloadable electronic games via the internet and wireless devices<br />
<br />
<br />
It could be anything, but it could also be the next WoW expansion. With Gamescom coming up in a couple of days, we could also be looking at the name of the next Diablo 3 expansion. <br />
<br />
In any case, it looks like it's time to jump on the speculation train until we can get our hands on more information.<br />

<br />
The WoWwiki Article that was linked on the Dark Below is interesting. It implies a place ON Azeroth where Demons might exist. Sort of a &quot;below the Twisting Nether&quot; region. If this is the case, a demon-themed Expansion could certainly be appropriate, and if it is literally within the deeps of Azeroth, there is a lot that Blizzard could do:<br />
--Azshara, in the &quot;Deeps&quot; beneath the oceans.<br />
--Wrathion is the Aspect of Earth.<br />
--A return to Azjol'Nerub, and possibly small updates to Northrend.<br />
--If the above is true, then perhaps a continuation in Bolvar the Lich King's storyline.<br />
<br />
It could be very, very interesting regardless.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oooh, AWESOME find with Ozumet &lt;Fiend of the Dark Below&gt; as his title. That certainly gives more credit to an Azshara expansion, especially considering that people have brought up the Neptulon kidnapping as a plot hole in WoW's lore for almost two years now. :)</div></div><hr />

After Gamescom next week, if the D3 expansion is named the Dark Below, we will know. If the D3 expansion is NOT named that, then it's 99% certain to be World of Warcraft: The Dark Below.<br />
<br />
On the balance of probabilities it could go either way. The Dark Below could be a reference to N'zoth but it could just as easily be a D3 reference.<br />
<br />
IF it's a D3 reference, then we have a precedent that the name for the next expansion probably won't leak in this manner until the end of October.</div></div><hr />

As they did with hearthstone. It was trademarked off shore so they can then later trademark in the US. I believe they have up to a year to trademark something after its announcement. I'm no attorney but the way it was explained to me, as long as it is trademarked somewhere, it shows intent and thus secures the trademark in the US.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the other hand, with Garrosh setting up beneath Orgrimmar, and the heart being down there, it could be an invasion point for the legion (since the heart evidently is a source of power). It could also relate to whatever lies underneath Tirisfal. I believe it was confirmed that it wasn't an old god quite some time ago, but there's been the Faerie drakes and mushrooms up there for a while, and an event that plays out every few hours indicates there IS a source of power or something under there. For all we know, a secret group of high elves (or Human Warlocks from the kingdom of Lordaeron) formed another portal when they landed in Tirisfal and it turned into a demon portal, only to have it buried both physically and from history/lore out of shame.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Great Dark Beyond&quot; is the WoW term for space. The &quot;Twisting Nether&quot; is a realm separated dimensionally from material realm, so it's above, below, and even in us. Unless of course there's a tear like with Draenor, in which case it would be in a specific place.</div></div><hr />

IIRC the Twisting Nether is another dimension &quot;twisted&quot; with that the dimension Azeroth is in. So not space as we would describe that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The next Expansion for WoW is closer than the next expansion for Diablo 3.<br />
<br />
It has been stated that after Mists of Pandaria, we will go back to the real Azeroth. So no, No Argus. Kul Tiras is part of the the &quot;Real Azeroth&quot;. And it's a maritime kingdom.<br />
<br />
We know that the next expansion has to do something with the burning legion, as Wrathion in the next patch stated that his plan wasruined by Varian. If he took over Orgrimmar, it would take a year for him to take over Mulgore and unite everyone to defend against the burning legion. 1 year is usually how long it takes between expansions.<br />
<br />
Azshara. She has close ties with the Burning Legion. Will she ally herself with them again? Maybe.<br />
<br />
The Tomb of Sargeras. You know, it's now deep under water? And thinking that there is nothing that can be of interest to the burning legion is plain naive.<br />
<br />
So yeah, it's the next expansion 100%. I am surprised a lot of people think that the next expansion is about the burning legion, and throw away the naga completely. You can't delve into Azshara without delving into the Burning Legion. You just CAN'T separate the two.</div></div><hr />

It's possible they've previously registered it overseas. Perhaps in a small little known country that doesn't upload it's trademark records online.<br />

The &quot;Below&quot; in The Dark Below<br />
This implies a region that is underneath the crust of Azeroth, and not the twisting Nether in outerspace up in the sky. In early conceptions, hell is percieved to be underneath and not up in the sky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand they did this with the Heathstone trademark - registered it overseas then transferred it over in the roughly one year they have to do so (afaik)<br />
<br />
If the info provided by MMO-C is correct, then they didn't apply for a trademark first overseas with this one. The filing basis is 1(b) - which simply means an intent to use the mark. If the filing basis were 44(d) (as with Hearthstone), then that would mean they are claiming priority to an overseas filing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The &quot;Below&quot; in The Dark Below<br />
This implies a region that is underneath the crust of Azeroth, and not the twisting Nether in outerspace up in the sky. In early conceptions, hell is percieved to be underneath and not up in the sky.<br />
<br />
yeh but look...<br />
<br />
Article:Hell Their belief system was later revised to the philosophy of the Holy Light. The realm from which demons are summoned was originally referred to as Hell, Hades, and the underworld, as opposed to the Twisting Nether. This is not a true retcon as later sources confirm the existence of hell, although it is synonymous with the Twisting Nether, which goes by many titles. Hell as one of its names has been referenced in later sources.<br />
<br />
In Warcraft I, and to a lesser extent Warcraft II &amp; Warcraft III, and in the novels, Day of the Dragon specifically, the terms &quot;hell&quot;, &quot;hells&quot;, &quot;Hades&quot;, &quot;lower planes&quot;, &quot;the underworld&quot;, &quot;damnation&quot;,, &quot;pit of darkness&quot; and &quot;Dark Below&quot; are used in a very traditional sense.</div></div><hr />

actually the twisting nether is not outer space. it is the void left behind after the shattering of outlands. hence it was once beneath the lands of outlands. and it is quite dark there if you havnt tried flying around it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW related however... Guess it could be either:<br />
1. Nazjatar, Naga, Azshara, the Great Sea, N'zoth perhaps?<br />
2. The underground of Azeroth<br />
3. This Dark Below demon related thing<br />
<br />
I personally go with Nazjatar. If I recall correctly, it's been said that we're going back to Azeroth after MoP (yeah, not sure how that works, since Pandaria is on Azeroth...) and this Dark Below sounds like it's not on Azeroth. So that leaves the sea or the underground and I can't see what they'd really do with the underground. The sea at least got the before mentioned aspects. So my guess is that this could be something related to the Great Sea and Nazjatar. Looking forward to see what it might actually be, possibly at Gamescon. =)</div></div><hr />

Because hundreds of people probably already know this title internally, and it'd be easy for someone who is unscrupulous to find out and do something dastardly, like register it out from under you. Blizzard like all companies invests capital in a title.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Irrelevant. Someone on the outside could be told, and they have no real link to Blizzard, and they would suddenly be in possession of a trademark. You don't take chances with this when the stakes are millions of dollars, as every expansion is to Blizzard. You simply do things ahead of time. <br />
<br />

Again, this is not something you wait until the last minute to take care of. If I'm right.<br />
<br />
Not only that but has Blizz ever trademark any of the diablo expansions? Also this is right around the time Blizz trademarks their next expansion for wow, MOP was trademarked August 2011. Add to that the trademark looks exactly as it did for the previous expansions it makes me lean heavily towards the next wow expansion.<br />
<br />
I think a hell themed expansion for Diablo would actually have the word Hell in it.</div></div><hr />

Whilst yes, it would fit a Diablo 3 expac the name also fits in with the WoW universe to the point where it could easily be referring to an area or place directly by name. <br />
<br />
I'm still split between the two. We had info on that obviously Diablo themed announcement to be coming at gamescom and you already know about my feelings on this being a WoW expac title so... <br />
<br />
Honestly, I can't say anything for certain unlike previous trademarks in the past. <br />
<br />
Guess we'll just have to wait for gamescom to find out if this is the title of the Diablo expac that's inevitably coming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
'Diablo-related announcement' Does not translate to 'Diablo Expansion'. People are taking it out of context.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that it COULD be an expansion? Yes. Is it possible that it has nothing to do with an expansion and is just a big plan for Diablo? Yes. This trademark sounds EXACTLY like a WoW expansion relating to the Naga and the Dark Below that Ozumat is supposedly the lord of. So far, 'Dark Below' can only relate to the burning hells in Diablo, which is further off than an actual place called the Dark Below like there is in WoW.</div></div><hr />

It actually makes sense to file before you announce the title - that way, you have priority over anyone else who tries to file once you announce.<br />
<br />
Meaning only a few days before. They would have already trademarked a D3 title a while ago. As someone else mentioned, it can't be the foreign filing thing either as it is filed as an original and not to take claim over one already filed overseas.</div></div><hr />

Yeah something Naga/Old God themed I think.<br />
<br />
It would be nice to see what happened to Neptulon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The actual quote from Lady Naz'jar is &quot;Destroy these intruders! Leave them for the great dark beyond!&quot;<br />
<br />
While it is not literally the trademarked name, it is pretty damm close to assume a hint to a Azshara expansion.</div></div><hr />

It'd be easier for Blizzard to come up with a new name than to fight in a couple dozen countries for the name back, regardless of how much they spent on the logo.<br />
<br />
Except they're only concerned with US. None of their other marks have been registered in any other countries.</div></div><hr />

Then I think of Coilfang Reservoir and how it has a slight steampunk style to it...this would help the naga theory.

Considering it was visible from Stormwind Harbor after 'surfacing', and being mentioned as having surfaced by the NPCs.... Yes? Part of Vashj'ir ended up above sea level.</div></div><hr />

Dunno if you were bein' silly or not, but the &quot;list&quot; was proven to be a hoax years ago. In fact, the creator of the hoax even admitted to such in the very same thread he started it in http://wow.allakhazam.com/forum.html?forum=21&amp;mid=119012268058738816&amp;p=1</div></div><hr />

Right, except the entire questing zone was underwater and bright, which was the original point.</div></div><hr />
