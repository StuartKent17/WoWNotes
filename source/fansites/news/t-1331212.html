<br />
So basically, we go from Middle of the pack (More like lower middle) at the end of 5.3 to Bottom of the pack the second 5.4 hits until we get our 4p and move back up to lower middle. I'm trying really hard to stay with boomkin, but It's becoming increasingly hard to not just reroll to something that is consistent from patch to patch.</div></div><hr />

You're only looking at the pvp ramifications. The nerfs are actually quite acceptable there, I agree, but in pve they're not entirely justified. Shamans are in a good place in pve and I question what this could do to them. Particularly after Ghostcrawler just said that he thinks we're in a &quot;good place&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Ooh overly tetchy response there. But seeing as I used to play as one when they were the underdogs (so from TBC to pre ToT MoP) their weaknesses have not changed (easily kited, locked down, most powerful buffs still tied to 5hp sticks in the ground) and being exceptional 15 seconds every 3 minutes... problem possibly in that. I was an advocate of toning down Ascendency's power and giving it a lower cooldown.<br />
<br />
And in PvE, yeah that's a large amount of their power lopped off.</div></div><hr />

Hard to take someone serious who can't spell and doesn't make much sense in their debate. You seem like a troll. People are going to QQ when their class gets nerfed. It doesn't matter if it's justified or not. Look at Holy Pallys. They've consistently been one of the top healers in this game since Burning Crusade, and now that they are not, there are a lot of them QQing and raging over it. <br />
<br />
Let people QQ and get on with their lives.</div></div><hr />

You'd be lucky if it was, I personally have all my wants on that because Transmogging into good looking higher res/higher polygon armor is just freakin' awesome overall especially when themed perfectly for your class.

<br />
2% of damage is still good.<br />
<br />
I actually think the change is a good thing.<br />
<br />
We'd either have to have the raid balanced around everyone having the legendary cloaks, which would shut people who didn't have the cloak out. Or we'd have to balance around not having the cloaks, in which case the dps requirements would be met too easily with groups who had full cloaks.<br />
<br />
Maybe making the legendary cloak easily (if time consumingly) accessible to all wasn't such a great idea for balancing.<br />
<br />
Unrelated, but that Blazing Longsword change is long overdue. ¬¨.¬¨</div></div><hr />

What a load of bullshit. I think Blizzard should learn how to design tier bonuses before they strip moonkin's aoe ability. What will be the point of multidotting in any situation anymore? Hell, i'll proc SS less in pvp now. And I don't even get the 4pc bonus in pvp for bonus crit chance.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to imagine the QQ if this a transmog set to be bought on the WoW store. The helms along costed about ¬£10 each; ¬£80 for a whole set, maybe? Not only that, but the sheer quality of the set too. I'm hoping it's merely some sort of 'test' of a Challenge Mode set for the next expansion, or the first of several Class Sets for every class that will be rewarded as part of some sort of quests/achievements.<br />

Don't be naive. We all saw it coming when the tier sets were horrible quality and looked straight up goofy with some of them. They're saving the good tier for the store.</div></div><hr />

t16 4pc- 1 free chi every 20-40 seconds! I can't wait!<br />

Spending more chi for TeB! That's exactly what we needed. It's not like the 57% damage increase we'd get on average from RoRo is drastically more than the new TeB. I mean, we're looking at like 30% increased damage now with the new brew.<br />
<br />
And we still don't have any raid utility. Meanwhile, assassination rogues are getting buffed out the wahzoo again. So now they'll still have amazing damage, attack speed buff, tricks of the trade, and smoke bomb! Go them!</div></div><hr />

So basically, we go from Middle of the pack (More like lower middle) at the end of 5.3 to Bottom of the pack the second 5.4 hits until we get our 4p and move back up to lower middle. I'm trying really hard to stay with boomkin, but It's becoming increasingly hard to not just reroll to something that is consistent from patch to patch.<br />

The enhancement nerfs are too many, what are they thinking? just playing with numbers?<br />
<br />
1) Stormstrike nerf<br />
2) lava lash nerf<br />
3) Fire elemental totem glyph nerf (huge nerf here, in order to sync it with elemental mastery and berserking/racials you must use it every 3 mins instead of 2.5 and it will be out for 30sec instead of 36= 17% less dps time at each pop QQ)<br />
4) Totemic Restoration was deemed useless? It was extremely useful, i could use my fire elemental for less time if there was a case of dps cease for some reason (megaera head dead for example)<br />
5) New pve set t16 bonuses for the enha are laughable but they are nerfing them too<br />
6) RPPM trinkets will be so terrible, with cd on pull and nerf if they give your main stat for X seconds that i dont think it's worth even reforging to haste or even taking new trinkets..<br />
7) Healing rain with healing storm? forget it, we can't be useful anymore. our healing rain will tick for 12k again..<br />
<br />
Why all this hate, stupid blizzard..Now we will see rogues going way ahead , at least i could challenge them and beat them occasionaly, same with locks..but now..no way. bye bye top 1-5 spots<br />
<br />
About all who say &quot;dont worry they just started with the tuning process&quot; i am just telling you, there were like half of these nerfs before the tuning process now there are more. It is a strategy from blizzard, in the end they will remove half the nerfs, we will be happy with just the few nerfs and thats it.

I have seen how blizzard works in patches the last 7-8 years, like many others here. <br />
So they decided to nerf enhancement because of various reasons like their nephew's retri isnt topping meters or their gf was ganked by an enhancement shaman or because a lower rank blizzard guy's enhance is raping them in pve. Anyway. Their tactic is simple<br />
Throw some nerfs in the PTR, enhance community gets freaked,<br />
Blizz responds &quot;dont worry we will throw some class tuning in 1-2 ptrs<br />
Community gets happy &quot;oh nice we wont get raped&quot;<br />
Blizz starts the tuning process, more nerfs, insane ones<br />
Community wants to suicide<br />
Blizz ends the tuning process, having removed the extra nerfs<br />
Community is happy with the few nerfs!<br />
<br />
If this procedure didn't occur, blizzard believes that we would have whiners all over. To be honest i think they are right but it is still lame to fool us around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
aimed shot nerf (meh) and arcane shot (what?) nerf, but buff to explosive shot is nice, i am also going to love the removal of proc chance from trap for L&amp;L and sharing cooldown, so now its a straight rotation and dont have to worry about 1 or the other, just rotating explosive/arcane and then unloading L&amp;L when procs...very nice. <br />
<br />
Warlock buffs to dots is pretty sweet, affliction has been stagnant for awhile, at least now its a small throughput increase for them, and a welcome addition to my warlock's leveling and questing. <br />
<br />
Warrior buffs looking good, the deep wounds espcially, thats a huge buff, 220 to 330 and double the extra damage %? and that slam buff...nice! <br />
<br />
And did you see the buff to balance druids? if i read that correctly it basically says balance spec can now heal with any heal while in balance spec? not just certain heals? or? that would be a welcome change for survivability in pvp and pve, being able to heal yourself without dropping balance form. <br />
<br />
the buffs to rogues is amazing, maybe they will stop bitching (as much anyways) about rogues needing buffs and always left out? lol...maybe...but aucutually makes me want to finish leveling my rogue i havent touched in years. (super exciting)<br />
<br />

Man, you are the worst kind of player. The unfounded bashing mixed with nerd rage and disgusting cynicism. As if the game revolves around you, IT'S A PTR. They're tuning things out, some of these changes definitely suck, but they mentioned they would be tuning. And it goes without saying, but I guess it has to be said anyways, &quot;These changes are not final and are always subject to change before final release.&quot;<br />
<br />
Enhancement is doing AMAZINGLY well, the nerf isn't huge, I play both Elemental and Enhancement, even I know I need a small nerf. Stop trying to figure out the psychology of Blizzard like there is some hidden agenda to everything.<br />
<br />
If these changes make it to the official release patch notes, THEN you can rage all you want, but in a corner... alone, with ice cream... away from the interwebs. Your tears are so not delicious.</div></div><hr />

So basically, we go from Middle of the pack (More like lower middle) at the end of 5.3 to Bottom of the pack the second 5.4 hits until we get our 4p and move back up to lower middle. I'm trying really hard to stay with boomkin, but It's becoming increasingly hard to not just reroll to something that is consistent from patch to patch.<br />
<br />
I gave up a long time ago and rolled mage if i needed to be dps :/ My main is still resto though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im just pulling this out without any real bases considering i haven't tested with the nerf of course but it seems more like a failed attempt to hold off crit stacking. It will only be a nerf to that hypothetical damage you could have been doing without the nerf in 5.4 prior to the new stats you'll be adding on. Fire will still be #1.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, in pvp, as a hunter, I do a ton of damage. HOWEVER, on the flipside, in raids I disagree. Just keep QQing about a spec that you don't play please.</div></div><hr />

Instant powerful spells is one of the big problems in PvP today. Shamans casting a lava burst, followed by a lava surge proc lava burst with each one getting echo/mastery procs doesn't help at all.<br />

That's another bad thing about hunters in todays WoW. Too low PvE DPS because their stationary damage is so similar to their mobile and too high PvP damage because they can dish out full damage while staying mobile. They need to tune down mobile dmg and reward stationary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you see, that I respect. I am still a hunter baby, only starting in Cata with my current main, but I still remember getting a DPS buff from standing stationary as Survival for like 15 seconds was it? That was pretty nice! I love being a mobile DPS but in raids if they keep hashing my PvE DPS over what we might do in PvP either they need to make spells act different in pvp environments to appease the QQers over hunters or something, because getting penalized over it constantly is getting irritating! I think most classes can agree with this for their own class!<br />

Umm, I can't agree with the homogenizing feel that they are pressing onto BM but I think testing on the PTR we'll still be a-okay. I'm still unsure of what spec I want to bounce around with next teir because of these awkward removal of spells, nerfs, buffs that they're tinkering with on hunters anyways. I'm a little frustrated that Ghostcrawler tweeted about Hunters feeling too similar to each other's specs and yet they gave Kill Command to the other two specs, took away our Intimidation and yeah! It feels hypocritical to say the least. Hopefully the magical changes to hunters will come out in future PTR builds? Who knows at this point. IIRC though, I believe Kill Command used to be available to all other specs at one point in the game's history!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's also a phase that requires a lot of feedback. Plus it only lasts a few weeks at most. If people don't open their mouths, nothing will change and these nerfs will make it to the Release Candidate.<br />
<br />
The only way to fix these &quot;PvP changes affecting PvE and vice versa&quot; nerfs/buffs is if Blizzard were to create a complete different ruleset for PvP. Make it happen already!</div></div><hr />

<br />
[Shooting Stars You have a 30% chance when you deal critical periodic damage with your Moonfire or Sunfire to instantly reset the cooldown of your Starsurge and cause its next cast within 12 sec to be instant. Druid - Balance Spec. This chance is reduced against multiple targets. Druid - Balance Spec.<br />
<br />
Basically its a nerf to our proc? Instead or adding something like stacking to max of 3 Shooting Stars they decide to nerf it?</div></div><hr />

H Durumu, Combustion drops from 24% to 11% of my damage.<br />

...and Im sick of idiots that keep saying this.<br />
<br />
The whole point of PTR is to report on issues.<br />
<br />
If the issue is not reported or raised it goes live.<br />
<br />
These Shaman nerfs are just rediculous. Fair enough PVP burst needed to be brought in line, but they totally gutted PVE as well. Nerfing Stormblast would have sufficed but this is a kick to the groin whilst we're on the ground.<br />
<br />
5.4 We have already had our 4pc nerfed to the ground - that was supposed to fix our AoE issue and has done absolutely nothing to fix it, RPPM has been nerfed which hit us hard and now this?<br />
<br />
Yeah good luck being Enhance next tier if this goes live.</div></div><hr />

A 10% reduction on base dmg with a 90% SP scaling increase... is that overall a HUGE nerf? A slight nerf? Or considering haste values/gear scaling/being at the latter end of expac, could it be a buff?<br />

Buff everyone else way up there and nerf hunters AGAIN in a majer way, takeign away readiness is HUGE due to if your strat is to save it for a burst in the fight like i do or a chance to stand still its theo nly thing keeping us atleast 4orth on dps meaters. after oyu take it out.. we will be 7th on dps meaters and NOW your killing our main shot for all specs...what does this accomplish?<br />

<br />
^^^ but you see if they tune down moble then you have a massive prolem in PvE aswell. many fights need you to move, if you can not then your doomed, correct? so i htin it's simple fix, why dont you just lower the dmg for hunters against enimy players by a small %age so that it meats requirments? simple. ofcourse no one wants to do that cus people will complain &quot;oh nooooooooooooooooo now when i pvp im being nerfed jsut for pvp nuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu&quot; shush.... <br />
PvP has cost hunters soooo much dmg in PvE, i went from being #1, to 4 in one patch now i am going from 4 to 7......because of PVP....if oyu jsut nerf them just agaisnt enimy players you can keep them fine in pve. thats all</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabrius</div><div class="date">2013-08-14, 09:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All these people crying about the Affliction buffs, really need to stop tunneling on current raid bots, frothing at the mouth and actually look at what is happening before they start boiling water with their foreheads. Malefic Grasp: Affliction locks spend anywhere from 40-60% or more of a fight channeling this. It's an enormous portion of our damage. Blizzard, almost cut this ability in half. So yes, we do &quot;NEED&quot; these buffs. If your precious auto attack got halved, you'd be asking for a buff too. That's basically Affliction at this point. Or since we'll be losing UVLS (100% crit trinket) maybe we actually do need a buff to compensate for an extraordinarily broken trinket. Guess what, outside that trinket, Affliction is actually kind of terrible. That trinket was broken from the start, and made two warlock specs go from lower middle of the pack to upper. It's almost like I'm applying logic here, isn't it?<br />
Before you bring blinded, emotionally charged statements onto forums. Save yourself the effort of proving to everyone that you have the IQ of a spoon and read up on what's happened before to maybe warrent some of these changes. <br />
<br />
That said. Blizzard has stated thousands of times the disclaimers of PTR, yet few actually understand what testing actually is, and/or how it works. Instead of saying, &quot;Holy Crapz roge buffed =(((((&quot;. Think &quot;why?&quot; Hasn't blizzard said they wanted to migrate damage to rogues active abilities. I'd lay bets we're about to see a poisons nerf seeing as less than like 30% of their damage is actually controlled by them. Then you trolls can go home happy. <br />
<br />
Wait. Just wait. Try it at least once, before you start foaming at the mouth next time. Chances are, you might not actually know everything.</div></div><hr />
