New Command Boards<br />
The command boards in Orgrimmar (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1637-orgrimmar) and Stormwind (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1519-stormwind-city) have received visual upgrades on top of a new UI. They use the same menu now that we used to choose our artifact weapons and your options change as you level up. You also get a small picture and a brief description of the zone and what the story will contain.<br />

The Nighthold Updates<br />
The uninstanced version of the Nighthold (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/8025-the-nighthold) has seen some changes, becoming more of a small faction hub. Both Alliance and Horde can visit as of now. There are teleport stations that lead to Dalaran (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/7502-dalaran) and Orgrimmar (http://www.wowdb.com/zones/1637-orgrimmar) usable by the Horde as well as all of your favorite characters from the Suramar campaign, such as Thalyssra (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/98312-first-arcanist-thalyssra) and Theryn (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/104618-theryn). Pandaren monks have also arrived to teach the Nightborne the ways of the http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk class.<br />

Thunder Totem Updates<br />

<br />
It looked like to me they just changed the wording to more accurately reflect the achievement. It read as gear from Ulduar 10 man, when it was always just 226 gear and 232 weapons. I don't see where they removed any of the old requirements. Also they increased the boss' health significantly. I think this achievement is actually going to be harder. Unless I'm missing something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's looking like the groundwork is being layed for DX12 and or Vulkan as future API's. This change when it comes, not an if in my opinion should hopefully put those 6+ core CPU's to good use in raids and major congested areas like Dalaran.</div></div><hr />

Yep, Blizzard have completely ballsed things up and released the patch to EU players 12 hours before scheduled maintenance, so now it's impossible to play until they update the servers. Bravo.</div></div><hr />

Scan and repair does nothing. The servers are what need changing, not people's installs. You can't revert to an old patch. The scan and repair action is a boilerplate response to incompatible servers, since it's usually the player missing the patch, not the server itself. <br />
<br />
And mistakes of this magnitude should not be happening from a company that has been running an MMO for over 13 years. How do you push a patch 12 hours early by mistake? How are there not systems in place to stop something like that happening, and locking an entire continent out of your game in the process? It's staggeringly incompetent and amateurish.</div></div><hr />

It's been sorted by pushing the old patch out again. So that's a 2.2GB of 7.3.5, another 1.6GB to revert to 7.3.2, then another 2.2GB tomorrow to get back to 7.3.5. Nice for those with monthly bandwidth limits. No, not being able to play a video game isn't the end of the world, but I'm staggered that something like this can just happen with no checks in place to stop it, whether it be from someone hitting the wrong button or whatever happened. Hopefully they'll learn from this.<br />
<br />

Saying &quot;LOL IT'S AN ACCIDENT&quot; does not absolve the people who made the mistake of responsibility. Just like it didn't with the Hawaii situation, since you brought that up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it happened. All we can do is move on. How else did you want them to get us back on the old patch? <br />
<br />
It's a video game. And again mistakes/accidents can happen. The video game industry no matter how old is not immune to it. The patch was pushed by accident and in about 10-15 minutes the issue was resolved.<br />
<br />
Nobody is saying that anyone should be absolved of blame. Just that this is being blown way out of proportion over 15 minutes. And acting like an accident/mistake should never ever happen is just silly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, i just found out about the Vanilla Enchanting Material changes and I was wondering about if the Dust/Shards/Essences just disappears/greys or will it be converted to Rich Illusion Dust?<br />
Can any NA player confirm this to us?<br />
<br />
And if it will be converted, what is the convert ratio for each Dust/Shards/Essences?</div></div><hr />

What I know is that it'll become easier to get the stuff you need due to personal loot and harder to get transmog for your other classes.<br />
Not sure if it also applies on Raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. Heroic 25 man sha of fear, amber shaper, most of mythic SoO now impossible to solo. And after all that with this new garbage personal loot being forced you'll have to run on multiple characters. This ranks up there for dumbest patch changes in long time. Already nothing to do but farm transmog stuff and they just took a bunch of that away</div></div><hr />

So that's a 2.2GB of 7.3.5, another 1.6GB to revert to 7.3.2, then another 2.2GB tomorrow to get back to 7.3.5. Nice for those with monthly bandwidth limits. No, not being able to play a video game isn't the end of the world, but I'm staggered that something like this can just happen with no checks in place to stop it, whether it be from someone hitting the wrong button or whatever happened. Hopefully they'll learn from this.<br />

Saying &quot;LOL IT'S AN ACCIDENT&quot; does not absolve the people who made the mistake of responsibility. Just like it didn't with the Hawaii situation, since you brought that up.<br />

Monthly bandwith limits? Are you living in the US or something? That is some seriously 3rd world internet bullshit.<br />

The only devices with limited monthly bandwith here are smartphones, anything else is unlimited for like a 20-40 euro a month.<br />

Changing boss health seems unnecessary... they weren't exactly part of the leveling experience anyway and giving MoP bosses 341% of normal health is a hell of a lot different than giving MoP quest mobs that much extra health.<br />
<br />
I guess they will go back to being steamroll in less than a year, but this does make quite a few MoP bosses impossible to actually solo currently as well as things like Mythic Butcher in Highmaul (maybe with mythic gear on a class with heavy CDs?)</div></div><hr />

As far as certain bosses not being solo-friendly, that is going to suck. Especially with the personal loot thing added in, doesn't that reduce the chances of getting a mount on the loot table?<br />
<br />
I also like how Horde gets 2 easy reps to use their allied race (Nightfallen is easy with class hall tokens + a guaranteed 1-1.2k rep a day), but alliance gets both Argus reps where AotL is not 'too' bad to level, but Argussian Reach is a pain in the arse. Oh boy.</div></div><hr />

To be fair once the Garrison is set up you never have to touch it again and can just go around zerging quests/doing bonus objectives.<br />
<br />
Should be an option to skip the Tanaan intro at this point though. More than enough quests in Draenor without it to get you from 90-100.<br />

Timeless Isle, frog gulf. The nearest underwater cave has 4 chairs around a campfire. Sit on a chair, click on the campfire, you're in Gorgrond.<br />

You can skip Tanaan intro by going to Timeless Isle. There's a cave that teleports you to Draenor. You then start quest for building your garrison skipping that Tanaan intro.</div></div><hr />
