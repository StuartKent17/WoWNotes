Patch 3.1 - Proto-Drake Mounts<br />
As mentioned in previous posts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=40602.0), a lot of mounts are being added to the game with Patch 3.1. Two of them are Proto-Drakes, the Ironbound Proto-Drake and the Rusted Proto-Drake. They're both 310% speed mounts, if you add this info to the few official posts we got in the past days, we can assume that they will be here to replace the Plagued Proto-Drake and Black Proto-Drake &quot;removed&quot; in Patch 3.1 (see this post (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/15443184457-upcoming-glory-of-the-raider-reward-changes.html)).<br />
We don't feel like it needs a 280% mount reward after 3.1 comes out, we are adding new 310% mounts as Ulduar achievements for players to shoot for. If you just want a 280% mount, there are others out there to purchase (red drake) and earn (red protodrake). <br />
Again, this is just speculation, nothing was confirmed by Blizzard for the moment. <br />

Engineering changes in Patch 3.1<br />
Here are some of the 3.1 changes for engineering so far:<br />
Added a new Reticulated Armor Webbing engineering enchant that increases the armor on plate gloves.<br />
Added a new Springy Arachnoweave engineering enchant that grants passive spell power in addition to turning your cloak into a parachute.<br />
Flexweave Underlay now grants passive agility in addition to its normal effect.<br />
Nitro Boosts now grant passive critical strike rating in addition to their speed boost. <br />
The list may not be conclusive and is subject to change over the course of the public testing process. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/15/15443253383-engineers-want-an-official-response.html))<br />
<br />
Noblegarden (April 12 to April 18) achievements and Patch 3.1 release date<br />
The current plan is to delay Noblegarden should the testing process run long. You should be able to get your week of egg-hunting in. And for those of you not looking forward to the egg-hunting of Noblegarden... I think you'll find it a wee bit different this year.

<br />
Replacing the Riding Crop in WotLK<br />
We don't have any immediate plans for trinkets to be used to increase mount speed past 70. It is something that we are discussing and we will have more information about this at a later date. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/15443446677-natural-mount-enhancement.html))<br />
<br />
Theorycrafting vs. PTR Testing<br />
We put a lot more faith in actual numbers generated on the PTR. We have no way of knowing what assumptions or errors third party tools may make, and we can't really spend our development time debugging someone else's project. Usually the player base itself eventually knocks the bugs out of those things and they become accepted over time as reasonable or rejected. So until a lot of you start to say that a given tool accurately represents the numbers you can generate on the PTR or live, we take them with a grain of salt. You probably should too.

Scent of Blood and Rune Strike<br />
Scent of Blood would be a good replacement for Bo Sanc if it had better numbers. It's high enough in the tree, and just below a mandatory tanking talent, that most DKs should have access to it. I will correct one misconception though. On-next-swing attacks do count as melee swings, so Rune Strike actually will generate runic power with the Scent of Blood aura on you (though Blood Strike will not).<br />
<br />
As clarified by a poster above, Rune Strike will also proc the Necrosis damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15673098091-are-we-gonna-get-comment-on-dk-threat.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking Threat<br />
Expertise and hit are great +threat stats. That is especially true of DKs who suffer a lot when one of their rotational abilities fails to land. My point about DKs just starting out is that the content just starting out is very forgiving of gear. The 5-player content is designed to be tanked by an Arms warrior.

Tree of Life in PvP<br />
We like the tree in PvP. We changed mechanics in LK such as the self-snare to make the tree more reasonable, but we don't think it's quite there yet. We imagined two different defensive styles -- the traditional hot and run approach or going into (or staying as) Tree of Life for a more stand-there-and-take-it tactic. The problem, we think, is that the tree isn't survivable enough now and the cost of shifting in and out of tree is a little high.

According to WoWHead, Nitros are 12 crit which is the same as Icewalker. The cloak thing is a letdown because it is only 10 agi; 12 less than Major. It doesn't require level 60 or better items, but you still have to be 380 engineering. So no twinking. Well, overall they are a wash. Boots acceptable, Cloak bad.<br />
<br />
Now if they add some passive crit to the haste glove tinker then I'll forgive them. Also some Hit to the rocket gloves. I won't hold my breath for any stats to the belt enchants because then we would have an actual edge on other professions, and we can't have that. I'll refrain from making Death Eyes at all the JC's with their Dragon Eyes and fancy daily quests. Or Blacksmiths with their glove and Bracer sockets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The crit on boots need to be in the order of 30 rating above what is offered as the same slot for them to actually make the profession worthwhile. Same for the cloak enchant.<br />
The thing is, Engineering doesn't really offer anything (mailbox still has a cumbersome cooldown and there's a repair vendor outside every instance, not to mention that the engineering-only consumables aren't worth their material cost). And to a previous poster, no the goggles aren't very good - they're just more accessible for people who do not regularly kill Kel'Thuzad on either difficulty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree with you, and this is from somebody who dropped Armorsmithing for Engineering when they released that fantastic Force Reactive Disk (Which I never did get). My basic point being that the Boot Tinker and the goggles are OK starting points, but need work to be really competitive. The cloak enchant is a big letdown. I was hoping for goggle upgrades in Ulduar. The place is full of Titan tech, so a Titansteel Goggle Tier 2 wouldn't be out of the question. It seems they are holding off on that or not doing it at all.<br />
<br />
But then I was waiting for most of BC for an upgrade to the Dragonling (or any of the combat &quot;pets&quot;: Sheep, Harvest Reaper, etc), Discombobulator, Reflectors, EZ-throw dynamite, Mind Control Cap, Deep Dive Helmet, Shrink Ray, Death Ray, Cloaking Device, Target Dummy, Flash Bomb or Universal Remote. Effects drop off after level 60 and we don't get a replacement? Thanks. Would it have killed them to give us a Fel Cannon, Mini-Fel Reaver or Khorium Nether Dragon? A Discombobulator that turns a player into a Broken? Where are my crazy whacked out trinkets that fill up a toolbox with something that isn't more motes or Ichors of Undeath? I'd like gem slots on the trinkets, but I'm not greedy. One gray slot no socket bonus.<br />
<br />
Things I would like to see for Engineering: <br />
<br />
<br />
More of the stuff I just mentioned. Skip the Broken Transmogrifier, make the new one turn your target into a Mechagnome. Add more gimmick grenades. For instance, a Blight Bomb that releases a short acting cloud of yellow poison as Drakuru does when you fight him. I loved the Arcane Bomb, upgrade that.<br />
A daily quest system. Something where your trainer (Goblin or Gnomish) in Dalaran gives you a mission to upgrade an existing recipe. Like so: &quot;I'd love to make a Gnomish Cloaking Device that worked up here in Northrend, but the wind whips through you when you are cloaked. Bring me two Cloaking Devices, one cloak of any type and five arctic furs.&quot; We can either end it there or add a second step where the quest guy hands you the device and asks you to test it a few times. Boom. Daily quest. That wasn't so hard. Repeat with existing engineering devices and ore/leather/gems from Northrend. You get GEEK (Or MEGA) Inventor Commendations. You spend them with your guy to get upgraded engineering stuff.<br />
Modify the failure system: from here on out, things only fail if you have below a determined level of engineering. Yes, non-engineers can use engineering gadgets. Keep the Goggles BoP, I do like an &quot;Engineering Badge&quot; but every dang thing you make shouldn't be engineer only. Especially with the death of ammo somewhere on the horizon.<br />
Clean up the recipe list. There are what, three &quot;Misc&quot; headings? I can't find a thing in there without that wide profession window add-on.<br />
Faction Recipes. I want to grind faction with people for things other than Arcanums and the odd bit of plate armor. Holy Hand Grenade from the Argents is almost a no brainer. An upgraded flame thrower or dragonling from Wyrmrest. A weak Warstomp-style Boot Tinker (+AP Passive) from the Sons. A weapon tinker (Gyroscopes that increase +hit and Dodge?) from the Knights of the Ebon Blade. I'm making this up off of the top of my head as I am typing this.<br />
<br />
<br />
In short, passive buffs from the tinkers are good. These bonuses (bonii?) are barely acceptable. If there are upgraded versions, that is great as long as they don't drop from Arthas. This profession still has a long way to go until it is even half as useful to the player as any of the non-Gathering professions.</div></div><hr />

Same for the cloak enchant.<br />
The thing is, Engineering doesn't really offer anything (mailbox still has a cumbersome cooldown and there's a repair vendor outside every instance, not to mention that the engineering-only consumables aren't worth their material cost). And to a previous poster, no the goggles aren't very good - they're just more accessible for people who do not regularly kill Kel'Thuzad on either difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
But the helm isnt even tuned to that. As a plate wearer the BoE blacksmithing armor is head and shoulders above the BoP eng goggles because the tuned the goggles to be a level 72 epic not a level 80. What would be nice though is for Ulduar to drop upgrade schematics like Sunwell did. They would kinda make sense coming out of Ulduar anyway.</div></div><hr />

And you'll need 440 engineering to craft a lvl 72 gear. Except for alts, I don't see a main toon leveling engineering to 440 before 72 (and even after that in a way that a 5-man drop + belt tinker wouldn't be better, thx to mats needed).<br />
<br />
Yes, the BoE dps plate helm is way ahead the goggles, for the same &quot;level 440 in profession&quot; and also better than some Tier helms/Raid drops. Even after the nerf.<br />
<br />
Actually, I would only change mine for the Obsidian one. And I don't even need to be Blacksmith.</div></div><hr />

Tree of Life in PvP<br />
We like the tree in PvP. We changed mechanics in LK such as the self-snare to make the tree more reasonable, but we don't think it's quite there yet. We imagined two different defensive styles -- the traditional hot and run approach or going into (or staying as) Tree of Life for a more stand-there-and-take-it tactic. The problem, we think, is that the tree isn't survivable enough now and the cost of shifting in and out of tree is a little high.

That is my second favorite thing to do in PVP. Right after Flash Bombing a Cat/Bear/Cheetah (you were going WHERE with that flag?). I wonder if Flash Bombs work on Flight form? Anybody know a druid?</div></div><hr />

You know they're talking about the druid playing DEFENSIVELY, right? As in, GETTING HIT. How is a 10 second DI bad for the druid if he's taking damage?<br />
<br />
And yes, as it's been since patch 2.0, Tree of Life is an Elemental. That means no polymorph, yes to banish, etc...<br />

Nope, flight form is immune to (almost all) CC, like all mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yes it is.<br />
Only people who are not engineers would ever say it´s not that bad.<br />
The goggles were goo in BC, as a BS I can make a BOE helm that´s better for almost all classes/specs.<br />
The engineering enchants are all worse then the standard enchants.<br />

Right now this is how good the professions are.<br />

Tailoring and Engineering offer nothing of value but atleast Tailoring offer some decsent pre raiding stuff which is why I rank it above Engineering</div></div><hr />

Yep, basically, the greedy ones are the ones selling the 25 man slot for 15K gold and the pathetic ones are the ones that feel the need to pay it.</div></div><hr />

Your rankings are fail. I agree tailoring and engineering are at the bottom but other than that the profession are almost 100% identical for stats.</div></div><hr />

offers 300g worth enchants for 2 gold price, a unique-looking mount (nothing as crap as lolcopter) unique (tho usless :D) cloak enchants and tones and tones of gold. <br />
