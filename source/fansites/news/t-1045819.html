And here it is, if Ensidia or Paragon would have gotten the first kill by stacking like this everyone would be calling foul play and crying so hard, double standards are fun, ain't they? None would be saying &quot;well done&quot; if other guilds stacked and got the kill.</div></div><hr />

So instead of stacking one class you have to stack two classes so it is ok? Haha, no. Double standards for the win.</div></div><hr />

Mm, I was expecting as much.<br />

Either way, I'm glad that a Korean guild got a world first kill. Takes some of the steam out of the NA vs. EU bickering, so it's good for good for them and good for all of us. =)<br />

<br />
<br />
paragon stacked feral druids to &quot;exploit&quot; a mechanic, these guys just stacked the highest output class<br />
<br />
nobody was all that bothered about the druids for wild mushrooms on raggy or whatever, just that ferals got ridiculously more damage than they should have to the point that the mechanic was even changed by blizz<br />
<br />
and even then, it's clever to use whatever you can to get the win, it's only double standards if you're quoting people who had a problem at any point with paragon/whoever, i mean, nobody had a problem (yet they often quote them for doing it) with stars stacking locks for yoggy right?</div></div><hr />

With them winning at Blizzcons Arena Tournament, and now this. GG.<br />
<br />
Blizzcon was mainly because people didn't practice at all vs PHD, sure they are good but also no one expected them to do well so they didn't bother to practice.<br />
<br />
Also world first on a boss that isn't even the last one, when EU is pretty much out of the competition means jack shit.<br />
<br />
Hell, even WoW means jack shit, game is so bad nowadays anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nobody was all that bothered about the druids for wild mushrooms on raggy or whatever, just that ferals got ridiculously more damage than they should have to the point that the mechanic was even changed by blizz<br />
<br />
and even then, it's clever to use whatever you can to get the win, it's only double standards if you're quoting people who had a problem at any point with paragon/whoever, i mean, nobody had a problem (yet they often quote them for doing it) with stars stacking locks for yoggy right?<br />
<br />
<br />
you do realize that many other classes had the exact same damage output that feral druids got on that fight (fire mages especially) right? they took the druids because of their versatility with having tranq and just being able to help out the raid more in tight situations. anyone that is a semi intelligent player knows they did not exploit anything, blizzard changed the way the buff worked because they realized it helped high dot classes more than anyone else and it was unfair.<br />
<br />
also grats to KIN, though i still hope a US/EU can get world first madness, hopefully vodka :p</div></div><hr />

no, 3 mages in G3, and 4 mages in G4, the mages that have darker background are simply out of range, which is why they appear like that. they used 7 mages, and 5 rogues for massive dmg.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it would make for sense for 6 arcane and 1 fire, or 7 arcane. Arcane is still top burst dps for non/low-movement fights i.e. tendons on spine and it would make sense for at least an even number (6) of arcane's to FM buff each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well its most likely sub because sub single target dmg is shooting through the roof with proper gear and has great burst and thus helps to minimise tendon phases and thus you have to survive for a shorter time and get less adds and debuffs. Where did you get the idea that cleaving is of comparable importance on spine?<br />
<br />
Edit: Also check out http://kr.battle.net/wow/ko/character/kargath/%EB%B0%95%EA%B7%9C%EB%A6%AC/simple<br />
he doesnt even have a combat spec and neither did any other rogue from them I checked (and why should he obviously on madness u want assassination and on spine sub if u understand the fights)</div></div><hr />

They don't have anymore legendaries than the other Top 20 world guilds they are competing with. All of those guilds have a legendary for all of their caster, so the top korean guilds dont have any advantage over any of the top US/EU guilds.

Only advantage they have is that they are the biggest end-game raiding guild in this game, boosting single players and gather them up for the progress-kills.<br />

Yes, I am sure that in the few months between the reports of a mass asian exodus and Blizzcon Blizzard managed to build an entire continent, class and all the rest of what's coming in 5.0/MoP. They can barely manage one content patch in that time with single digit bosses in a single raid instance reusing the same tired models, really don't see them rushing an entire expansion in that time period.</div></div><hr />

That's more or less correct - organized, exclusive guilds are largely looked down upon in Asian games. They much more so favor running with PUGs and the selling of wow items (with gold) is much, much more common. In college I had an international roommate from Burma who played on Korean servers (his parents were Korean and he spoke the language) - when I told him how my guild worked (US/EU guilds in general), how we run with the same people (generally) every week, etc etc -- he was quite appalled and upset that we weren't doing anything &quot;as a realm&quot; such as organized pugs, running gear runs and selling loot to the lesser geared, etc.<br />
<br />
He played for about three months on a US account and gave up, saying we were too antisocial and selfish.<br />
<br />
You see this in Asian literature and psychological profiles of Asian mothers -- this sense that the ego must be kept in check. I remember a case study from several years back of mothers who all routinely said that no matter how well their child did, they criticized some aspect of their performance (ex, &quot;Oh you got a 98? Well, it wasn't a 100&quot;). Not because they don't love their child and are proud of him/her, because they do love him/her and are proud. However they argue, the ego must be kept in check.</div></div><hr />

I read that 60% of all internet statistics are made up. I don't get why some people are upset about having 7 mages/5 rogues/4 shamans. Doesn't take a genius to look at the numbers and say, &quot;well this class/spec combo performs brilliantly on this encounter, let's bring as many of said class/spec combo we can.&quot;<br />

They get two for T11 and T12. It does NOT include T13.<br />

This is all around generally awesome. It makes me quite envious of that sense of community I'm sure it fosters, because as much as I love my guild and the social group I've built there, an entire server having a good community seems like a 'days of yore' thing.<br />
<br />
Still though, it's obvious that a kill like this requires an organized group, and grats to them!</div></div><hr />

I see &quot;only&quot; FIVE mages.<br />
The 2 ones with light blue bars are priests (the name color is white), they guy prob use light blue for priests (after all, white bar with white name wouldn't work well) and a more dark blue for mages.<br />
<br />
If you look close, there is only one mage at G4 and four at G5 <br />
<br />
It is stacking anyways, but lets not &quot;omg 7 mages&quot;.<br />

It wasn't a bug. The mechanic was working as intended, and then Blizzard CHANGED the mechanic completely, because they did not like how it played out, and wanted the damage buff that Nef's mind control gives out to be much more fair for every DPS class, and not overpowered for DoT classes. If you'd ever progressed on Nefarian heroic, you'd be aware of this.</div></div><hr />

Please, since you seem to be so fully informed, tell us lesser beings exactly WHAT mechanic bugged? I'm sorry but it was mathematically proved that everything was working as intended<br />

same could be said for this kill. Mages exploited a broken legendary that boosts your damage to ridiculous heights. Shamans exploited spirit link totem to remove the max health debuff and it's not known yet if the hotfix was applied to korean servers before this kill</div></div><hr />

I've been there twice, to Seoul, and I'm telling you - that place blows London, Paris, New York...out of the freaking water! And I mean -all- of it, as a whole. The country areas are also not as poor as you might think too! ;)Anyway, huge grats to them!<br />
<br />
No it's because when there's a fight of this difficulty, the first kill is usually using an exploit and from what was said in the post on Paragon's site, it seems like it was an exploit. Innocent until proven guilty of course so until then, congratulations to them.</div></div><hr />

(a rumor)<br />
<br />
They only used 1 resto shaman. The totem can very well be used to help clear the healing debuff when needing to roll. The other shaman are ele.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see &quot;only&quot; FIVE mages.<br />
The 2 ones with light blue bars are priests (the name color is white), they guy prob use light blue for priests (after all, white bar with white name wouldn't work well) and a more dark blue for mages.<br />
<br />
If you look close, there is only one mage at G4 and four at G5 <br />
<br />
It is stacking anyways, but lets not &quot;omg 7 mages&quot;.<br />
<br />
And after all, gratz to them!<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that why the paladin in RANGE has his name in white too ? White names in range. Grayed out is out of range. You are seeing it all wrong I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />

South Korea is one of the highest concentration of networks in the world. We are talking about T1 line connects to 90% of the country. This is partly due to the high amounts of funds the government supplied to companies to build tons of networks.<br />

And they post the Strategy!!! how about that!!<br />
<br />
There you have some information!<br />
<br />
Hey guys, I'm KR server Raid user<br />
<br />
It's not specific tactic but I think it's the main tactic<br />
<br />
즐거운공격대's spine members were<br />
<br />
7 arcane mage with legendary weapon 'Wrath of Tarecgosar'(Sorry I dont' know how to spell in English ^^<br />
<br />
5 incognito rougues(Sorry I don't know exact talent name in english; but it's usually pvp talent) and used dark dancing when dealing the rib line is popped up<br />
<br />
everybody knows that in Deathwing's spine, momentary dealing is needed very much!<br />
<br />
and 즐거운공격대 has solved this dealing problem like this.<br />
<br />
and next in healing, they brought 4 restore shamans<br />
<br />
I don't know it's a bug, but when Spirit link totem is used, debuff(that reduces player's maximum health by 6 percent every pile)<br />
<br />
is gone.<br />
<br />
That's how 즐거운공격대 killed the Spine, as I said I don't know specific tactic<br />
<br />
sorry for writing in bad English TT <br />
<br />
<br />
Exploited.</div></div><hr />

If it wasn't Telia being SHIT here in Europe I would have 1-2ms too, but my server in Frankfurt, Germany cause me to get routed through some Telia servers first that makes me jump to 15ms. I have 4-5ms to the servers located in Sweden (from Denmark).

And why should any guild that is known to exploit and cheat get any praise for anything they do.<br />

<br />
nobody was all that bothered about the druids for wild mushrooms on raggy or whatever, just that ferals got ridiculously more damage than they should have to the point that the mechanic was even changed by blizz<br />
<br />
and even then, it's clever to use whatever you can to get the win, it's only double standards if you're quoting people who had a problem at any point with paragon/whoever, i mean, nobody had a problem (yet they often quote them for doing it) with stars stacking locks for yoggy right?<br />
<br />
No you f***ing retard (ban me for a short period if you wish), Paragon did the same as these guys; they brought the highest output class (only thing is that the highest output class happened to blow everyone else away for the most part). People need to quit throwing the word &quot;exploit&quot; around because to exploit is to take advantage of something. The key part in Blizzard's banning of guilds is when they exploit BUGS, Paragon didn't exploit a bug and neither did this guild.</div></div><hr />

and next in healing, they brought 4 restore shamansI don't know it's a bug, but when Spirit link totem is used, debuff(that reduces player's maximum health by 6 percent every pile) is gone.<br />
I was all for them getting the world first, it made for a nice change.. but that's a pretty clear exploit, regardless of whatever else happened re: patch roll out.<br />
<br />
<br />
4 shaman sure only 1 was resto the other 3 were elemental http://www.wowprogress.com/post/75_Spine_of_Deathwing_World_First_Raid_Setup</div></div><hr />

I'm loling at the ignorance.<br />
<br />
You realize that the translation is VERY different. For instance Google translation calls Marks hunters something like Fire Hunters iirc. He probably used Google translation and that was what the closest translation came out to be.</div></div><hr />

None would be saying &quot;well done&quot; if other guilds stacked and got the kill.<br />
<br />
You know what this is the way it is right? <br />
<br />
Maybe it has something to do with most European/American guilds being arrogant as hell. Nobody likes dipshits, even if they are the best of the best and sadly most top guilds are dipshits who have to realize it's a game they're playing not something that will change the universe.</div></div><hr />

lol... people have been whining over someone posting there was a &quot;maybe&quot; bug, and he even goes and write last in his message that he didn't know their tactic.<br />
<br />
Big grats to KIN Raiders! and to all you &quot;ban them&quot; &quot;exploiters!&quot; sayers, you should all take an arrow to the knee!</div></div><hr />

And they post the Strategy!!! how about that!!<br />
<br />
There you have some information!<br />
<br />
Hey guys, I'm KR server Raid user<br />
<br />
It's not specific tactic but I think it's the main tactic<br />
<br />
즐거운공격대's spine members were<br />
<br />
7 arcane mage with legendary weapon 'Wrath of Tarecgosar'(Sorry I dont' know how to spell in English ^^<br />
<br />
5 incognito rougues(Sorry I don't know exact talent name in english; but it's usually pvp talent) and used dark dancing when dealing the rib line is popped up<br />
<br />
everybody knows that in Deathwing's spine, momentary dealing is needed very much!<br />
<br />
and 즐거운공격대 has solved this dealing problem like this.<br />
<br />
and next in healing, they brought 4 restore shamans<br />
<br />
I don't know it's a bug, but when Spirit link totem is used, debuff(that reduces player's maximum health by 6 percent every pile)<br />
<br />
is gone.<br />
<br />
That's how 즐거운공격대 killed the Spine, as I said I don't know specific tactic<br />
<br />
sorry for writing in bad English TT<br />
Exploited.<br />
<br />
Can we get a source on that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
None of the top guilds ever said spine heroic was impossible, only the lemmings below. The only quote I've seen of it from guilds actually progressing on it is that it's &quot;very finely tuned and will take a long time to get down&quot;</div></div><hr />

Lol. 7 mages also, would you call fire being buffed and then using fire mages an exploit??</div></div><hr />
