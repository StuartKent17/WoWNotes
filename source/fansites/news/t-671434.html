General<br />
Icecrown Citadel<br />
The Forge of Souls, the first wing of the 5-player dungeon, is currently available for testing.<br />
Additional Icecrown Citadel dungeon and raid content will be made available in future test builds.<br />
Dazed: Creatures attacking a player from behind can no longer cause players level 1-5 to be dazed, and have a reduced chance to cause players level 6-10 to be dazed.<br />
Copied Test Realm characters will no longer be copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
Default Equipment: Starting weapons are now more uniform. Rogues now start with a pair of daggers equipped. All other classes except shamans start with a 2-handed weapon equipped and the required skill already known. Shamans start with a 1-handed weapon and a shield, as they benefit more from the shield than they would from a 2-handed weapon.<br />
Glancing Blows: The mage, warlock, and priest classes no longer have an increased chance for their melee attacks to be glancing blows; and the damage penalty due to their glancing blows is the same as for other classes.<br />
Health and Mana Regeneration: These regeneration rates have been increased by up to 200% for low level characters. As a player's level increases, the regeneration rates gradually reduce, returning to normal rates at level 15.<br />
Spell Mana Costs: These costs have been reduced for almost all lower level spell ranks. In general, if a spell decreased in cost with a higher level rank in patch 3.2.0, that spell now has the decreased cost at all ranks. In addition, spells learned before level 20 with reduced cast times and/or durations have even further reduced mana costs, proportionate to their reduction in cast time or damage.<br />
<br />
Races: General<br />
Racial Attribute Bonuses: These bonuses have been recalibrated to even out the amount of starting health on the various races. All races start with a standardized level of stamina, except for orcs, dwarves, and tauren who now start with 1 extra point of stamina. For each class, bonuses and penalties to all attributes have been adjusted so that each race has an equal attribute total.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
Rune of the Stoneskin Gargoyle: There is now a 1-handed version of this rune in addition to the current 2-handed rune.<br />
<br />
Unholy<br />
Night of the Dead: Now reduces the damage your pet takes from area-of-effect damage by 45/90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Pets<br />
Avoidance (passive): Now reduces the damage your pets take from area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Misdirection: Redesigned. Instead of having finite charges, it now begins a 4-second timer when the hunter using Misdirection performs a threat-generating attack, during which all threat generated by the hunter goes to the friendly target. In addition, multiple hunters can now misdirect threat to the same friendly target simultaneously.<br />
Beast Mastery<br />
Intimidation: If the hunter's pet is in melee range of its target, the stun from Intimidation will now be applied immediately instead of on the pet's next swing or attack.<br />
Pets<br />
Avoidance: Now reduces the damage your pet takes from area-of-effect damage by 30/60/90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage <br />
Arcane<br />
Arcane Empowerment: This talent now also grants 1/2/3% increased damage done by the mage's party or raid for 10 seconds after the mage gets a critical strike with Arcane Explosion, Arcane Missiles, Arcane Barrage, or Arcane Blast. This effect is exclusive with Ferocious Inspiration and Sanctified Retribution.<br />
Pets<br />
Avoidance (passive): Now reduces the damage your pets take from area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest<br />
Pet<br />
Avoidance (passive): Now reduces the damage your pet takes from area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
Dual Wield: Rogues now know this ability upon logging into the game at level 1.<br />
Stealth: This ability no longer has multiple ranks. While active, the single rank of this ability (available at level 1) allows rogues to move at 70% movement speed.<br />
Vanish: For the first second after this ability is used, neither Vanish nor Stealth can be broken by taking damage or being the victim of a hostile spell or ability.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
Fire Nova Totem: This totem has been replaced with a new spell, Fire Nova, which is available at the same ranks as the old Fire Nova Totem. Existing characters will automatically learn this new spell in place of the totem. With a Fire Totem active, shamans will be able to use Fire Nova (fire magic) to emit the same area-of-effect damage as the old Fire Nova Totem from the active Fire Totem, not consuming the totem in the process. Fire Nova will activate a 1.5-second global cooldown when used and has a 10-second spell cooldown. The caster must be within 30 yards of the totem to use this ability, but does not need to be within line of sight of the totem.<br />
Elemental Combat<br />
Improved Fire Nova Totem: Renamed Improved Fire Nova. This talent now provides an additional 10/20% damage to the spell and reduces the cooldown by 2/4 seconds.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock<br />
Pets<br />
Avoidance (passive): Now reduces the damage your pets take from area-of-effect damage by 90%, but no longer applies to area-of-effect damage caused by other players.<br />
Summon Imp: This ability is now available from the trainer for level 1 warlocks and no longer requires a quest to learn.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior<br />
Victory Rush: This ability is now trainable at level 6.<br />
Protection<br />
Damage Shield: This ability will no longer trigger any chance-on-hit effects from the warrior or the opponent it damages.<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
Quest Tracking Feature<br />
This system is currently under development and is not fully functional.<br />
Looking For Group System<br />
This feature is undergoing several improvements and is not available for testing at this time.<br />
For additional notes on Lua and XML changes please visit the UI &amp; Macros forum.<br />
<br />
Graphics<br />
A new feature has been added to the D3D graphics engine to improve texture management (particularly for Windows XP users). This is currently enabled by default on the public test realms. For more information please visit our Test Realm forum.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Enchanting<br />
Black Magic: This enchantment now sometimes increases haste rating for the caster rather than inflicting the caster's target with a damage-over-time effect. It is also now triggered by landing any harmful spell rather than inflicting damage with a spell.<br />
<br />
Glyphs<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
Glyph of Icy Touch: Instead of granting additional runic power, this glyph now causes Frost Fever to deal 20% additional damage.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
Glyph of Fire Nova Totem: Renamed Glyph of Fire Nova. This glyph now reduces the cooldown of Fire Nova by 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />

Flame Strike: Some ranks of this spell had an incorrect cast time of 3 seconds. All ranks now share a 2-second cast time.</div></div><hr />

o Rejuvenation: Rank 15 of this spell was providing a 15-second duration. It has been correctly reduced to 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
Yah, shove Nourish down druids throats...<br />
<br />
Also, it took them the entire WotLK Beta, Patch 3.1, 3.2 to notice that the 3 seconds extra were a bug?<br />

Seems like blizzard puts a &quot;Anti-New MMO&quot; PTR (They released the CB of WOTLK when AOC come, the Achievment Patch with WAR launch now with Aion, the PTR of the bigest patch of the WOTLK) <br />
<br />
Those patch notes just suck for a &quot;Big Patch&quot; so wait 2-3 more months since the real 3.3 patch notes</div></div><hr />

With the talents and glyph, Elemental Shamans can rotate Fire Nova and Chain Lightening for massive AOE damage. 8)<br />

<br />
They &quot;balancing&quot; classes so they all the same: same stats, same talent types...<br />
<br />
There will be some difference of course, like &quot;Survival Instinct&quot; for druids and &quot;Last Stand&quot; for warriors or &quot;Holy Something&quot; for prot pallies or &quot;&lt;another cool name here&gt;&quot; for DKs<br />
<br />
If you look the current gear, you will see they all have same stats, just different names and i'm not talking about de alliance/horde, but like rogue/druid...<br />
<br />
Next expansion: 10 classes with just different names, they should just remove all classes and add &quot;melee&quot;, &quot;tank&quot;, &quot;ranged&quot; and &quot;healer&quot; as classes so they don't have to deal with 10 classes...<br />
<br />
IMO, that sucks, I don't feel that the class I'm playing is special...any class can tank anything...&quot;bring the player not class&quot; fuck that....</div></div><hr />

For some changes, there's no need to wait until later patches/builds. These changes will not unbalance anything by deploying them early.</div></div><hr />

Something inside me tells me that after the ToC drama (Clearing most if not all of the instance on day 1) we might not see ICC on the ptr at all.<br />
Or maybe just a few starter bosses.<br />
They dropped the ball with ToC and ICC just has to be completely amazing so testing it publicly might not be their way to go this time.</div></div><hr />

Well this gives credence to the popular theory that cataclysm will come during the first half of 2010. It looks like 3.3 is on track to be delivered by the end of the year and then cataclysm should come 5-6 month later if timings for previous patches/EP are to be believed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
To use Fire Nova Totem, you have to give up your existing fire totem. You lost one of your four totem buffs.<br />
<br />
This one is still centered on your fire totem, but does not consume it. It adds the existing fire nova totem effect to whatever fire totem buff you were already getting.<br />
<br />
If you already had enough shaman in your group that every fire totem you could have dropped already had its buff covered, then you gain nothing. But it's pretty much a straight-up massive buff for most shaman, I think.</div></div><hr />

You know that'll happen anyway, it's part of the Blizzard design philosophy now that any casual guild can easily clear the whole instance in 3 raid nights without difficulty.

i believe this is a nerf to unholy dps, unholy uses IT glyph just to get extra RP for more death coil spam, with that doing 20% more dmg is more likely a nerf to unholy then a buff to any DK spec</div></div><hr />

The Fire Nova Totem stun was really important and often (almost) game breaking.<br />
(When used properly It filled a gap between who wind shears when pushing on healer / made it possible to stormstrike an evasion rogue / stun rogue while getting kidneyshoted and generally sever well against 3v3 melee cleaves)<br />
Oh well ... :/<br />
<br />
Anyway, this is obviously a PvE change to give shamans (elem especially) more AoE dmg ...<br />
So to all you, whiners about how arena and pvp ruins the game for you, see its not always like that and that there are not only nerfs due to pvp but also changes for pve that nerf some pvp players.</div></div><hr />

The stun is obvisouly goin...<br />
Or are you REALLY expecting that Blizz will let you have instant (now it had 4 seconds arming time, so its not really easy to use it, you have to plan it a bit) AoE stun on a 10 or 6 or 3 sec cooldown? We are not DKs or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the talents and glyph, Elemental Shamans can rotate Fire Nova and Chain Lightening for massive AOE damage. 8)<br />
<br />
And Blizzard was quick on releasing Ice Crown Citadel to the test servers. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Love this change, to a certain extent.<br />
<br />
For an enhancement shaman, this is pretty awesome, go in melee, put magma totem and pop the fire nova and aoe like hell.<br />
<br />
For an elemental shaman, we have to get within melee range, put a totem in hte middle of the hopefully stationary group, press the nova and then start CLing to do a decent amount of dmg, while rogues are standing there spamming their 1 button doing, probably twice the aoe dmg as we do, and still beeing mobile. <br />
<br />
Shamans are stuck at one spot with a complex AoE rotation that isnt half as effective, oh well...<br />
<br />
No more fire nova stun, im SO fucked in arena (ele) now &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
Id say put it on a tad longer CD, and bring back the stun talent.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the lowlvl changes, they are all great, too bad my char screen has 10 characters over lvl 68 on it... WTB more character slots for Cataclysm plzzz</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering there's diminishing returns on stuns, we'd actually be left with a 4.5~ sec useful stun against a target - 3 sec initially, if you're glyphed + talented you put another 1.5 sec stun down and then they can move away from the totem. Not *too* overpowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually looking at a few past big content patches such as 3.1, 2.4, and 2.3, it's usually a month to a month and a half between the first PTR build and the patch hitting live.<br />
<br />
<br />
For each expansion it's been at least a year from the Blizzcon announcement before it was released.<br />
<br />
Each of the two expansions, you mean? Two data points aren't enough to conclude that things will always turn out the same way, especially when they also said (iirc) that they first announced wotlk too early.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see no rhyme or reason why Cataclysm will be any different.<br />
<br />
The time from announcement to release is not a good indicator imo. A much more reliable indicator is the usual delay between the release of content patches/expansion packs, and that has been pretty stable. And that's because they have to keep the pace at which they release new content. That's why the 3.3 release is a good indication of when they roughly expect to release cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stilgar</div><div class="date">2009-10-01, 09:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering there's diminishing returns on stuns, we'd actually be left with a 4.5~ sec useful stun against a target - 3 sec initially, if you're glyphed + talented you put another 1.5 sec stun down and then they can move away from the totem. Not *too* overpowered.<br />
<br />
Are you actually PvPing as shaman or not? No offense but to me it seems you dont.<br />
The nova stun is 2 sec, not 3 (we are not locks with OP shadowfury with 3 sec stun).<br />
2ndly, nova stun is in &quot;random&quot; stun diminish category thus not interfering wiht HoJ and other controllable stuns which is great.<br />
And yes it still have diminishing retruns but who cares, its short stun anyway. So yes, the 2nd stun is only 1 sec, but on the other hand it only lost 1 sec from its duration .... HoJ if used after another controllable stun looses 3 secs and that matters alot more.<br />
And even the 3rd nova stun (0.5 sec) would still be enough to land a nondodgable /parriable stormstrike which was a big part of enha sham pvp (to time ss after nova stun against rogues)<br />
<br />
Even if the 2nd nova stun would be 1 sec and the 3rd one 0.5 sec, it would still interupt spellcasting, so you can trivially (not like now with 15 sec cd and 4 sec arming time) use the rotation against healers like paladins (wind shear &gt; nova &gt; windshear &gt; nova &gt; windshear &gt; nova &gt; windshear).<br />
<br />
I will repat myself and say that its obvious that the stun is getting removed. (according to the current notes)</div></div><hr />

Because the lowerlvl's are a make or break moment for alot of people.<br />
I cant even count the amount of priests that i deleted pre lvl20 just because i got bored with it already, while a lvl80 priest still appeals to me.<br />
This way the lower levels become less of a drag to people and they might extend their &quot;class research&quot; time till the levels where a class becomes more fun.<br />
Expect more of these leveling changes to be made in 3.3 since its still a long way to lvl60.<br />
This doesnt have to mean an increase in levelingspeed but just making the classes more fun to play.</div></div><hr />

A spring release is very likely. I only foresee a fall release if something holds it back.<br />

This build is obviously not the complete one. We'll probably see another build later on next week and see them regularly once or twice a week for the next month or so. I'm really hoping ICC won't be on the PTR so guilds aren't taking out Arthas in the first night. ToC was gated so it took 5 weeks, but it was still cleared on heroic in the first day or so once that was out. Arthas already seems like a pansy with his &quot;This isn't over&quot; motto.

Fire Nova Totem: This totem has been replaced with a new spell, Fire Nova, which is available at the same ranks as the old Fire Nova Totem. Existing characters will automatically learn this new spell in place of the totem. With a Fire Totem active, shamans will be able to use Fire Nova (fire magic) to emit the same area-of-effect damage as the old Fire Nova Totem from the active Fire Totem, not consuming the totem in the process. Fire Nova will activate a 1.5-second global cooldown when used and has a 10-second spell cooldown. The caster must be within 30 yards of the totem to use this ability, but does not need to be within line of sight of the totem.<br />
<br />
Elemental Combat<br />
Improved Fire Nova Totem: Renamed Improved Fire Nova. This talent now provides an additional 10/20% damage to the spell and reduces the cooldown by 2/4 seconds.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
Glyph of Fire Nova Totem: Renamed Glyph of Fire Nova. This glyph now reduces the cooldown of Fire Nova by 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy Crap. Fire Nova on a 3 second Cooldown is going to be crazy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, yay for another short 3s cooldown high damage high-manacost spell available for Enhancement shamans. Unless they move Improved Fire Nova deeper down into the Elemental Tree it'll be easily reachable (17/54).<br />
<br />
Anyway, seems like Enhancers will finally have decent AoE. I might switch my PvE Main back to my Shaman with Cataclysm...</div></div><hr />

In Patch 3.3, pets will scale of all of your stats and allow buffs from raid encounters to affect them. <br />
In Patch 3.3, there will be changes to make sure that pets can't be hit by AOEs from bosses but others (PvP) will be able to affect them. <br />
Pets classes might get a &quot;move to this location&quot; command for their pet, long cooldown abilities that let your pet teleport to you to get out of trouble. This would be good feature since developers can't make pet AI as smart as a player.<br />

<br />
<br />
TBC was slower with new content? Are you kidding me?<br />
<br />
TBC had 15 five man instances at launch, WotLK had 12.<br />
TBC had 3 multiboss raids at launch, WotLK had 1 (which was recycled).<br />
TBC had 2 single boss raids at launch, WotLK had 2.<br />
TBC added 3 multiboss raids before sunwell, WotLK has added 2 before Icecrown.<br />
TBC added 3 quest hubs before sunwell (Ogri'la, Skyguard, Netherwing), WotLK has added 1.<br />
TBC added 1 new BG at launch, WotLK added 2 (counting Wintergrasp as one).<br />
TBC added no new BG after launch, WotLK added 1.<br />
TBC added no new 5 man instances before sunwell, WotLK has added 1.<br />
<br />
You can argue that either was better or worse but lets face it, they added a lot more stuff in TBC by this stage in the product cycle. The only place TBC is doing better is on the last three.<br />
<br />
The one thing they are doing a lot better is keeping it so there is always stuff to do. There is a lot less content but they are dragging it out over long time periods a lot more successfully, things like the new badge ranks, achievements, heroic and hard modes etc are keeping people very busy. Even now there is always something to do when I log in, no hanging around in shattrath. But if you look you will see the amount of new content is actually a lot lower.</div></div><hr />

It makes sense for hunters and warlocks. You can't 'aoe' their pets down. Mages and their Mirror Images are screwed though. They have 3k health. They can be very easily AoEed down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunter pets got a lot less hp than a wl pet... even a crab hasn't so much hp. two-three shot in bg already... comes now with the &quot;aoe-able&quot; flavour again. with this changes cunning skilltrees got to change! baba ravenger for bgs... hello mr crab(/p)s!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And vanish thing makes obvious overpowered rogue obviously more overpowered.<br />
I could nearly imagine... engage into combat as a hunter... rogue cos (maybe thistime anymore.lul save it for infight) 1sec &quot;can't touch this&quot; mode kidney shot though huntermark, piercing shots and serpentsting... at least you may use flare... ohh wait<br />
can't break by damage or abilities...<br />
hopefully I'm not right... would make rogues more a nightmare than they are now for hunters/wl/&lt;insert class name here&gt;...<br />
<br />
And I didn't start complaining about this pet issue! ;-)<br />
<br />
btw does anyone know when it will applied on european servers?<br />

I heard that spell ranks will be gone, and the spells get better on its own as you level. (For Catacylsm anyway - this is probably a step towards that)</div></div><hr />

After all, Blizzard did indicate that the events of the Cataclysm (ie big ass Dragon coming from the elemental plane from beneath the very soil we stand on) does happen AS we are assulting ICC, not before, not after, but during :)<br />

P.s. Loving dk tanks getting def for one handers, it was so hard getting gear for DW tanking that had stam and avoidance to compete with other classes and keeping def cap at the same time :)</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering why they're changing lv 1-15 things now when everything is getting revamped for Cata anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Think of how many people will be rerolling level 1 goblins and worgens. Also, since the old world is accessible to even vanilla players, they're probably also anticipating a lot of new players trying WoW when Cataclysm hits. It's a good idea to make the 1-15 experience a good one. Same with the Victory Rush at level 6. Some classes just are NOT fun at all until you hit a certain level. Some become fun sooner (rogues) and others takes a lot longer (warriors, paladins). Blizz did comment that paladins could use something other than judgement every 8s. But also said that paladins are really popular, but probably because they have less chance of dying unlike a lowbie warrior who dies if he gets 2 mobs on him.</div></div><hr />

Bah, it wasn't that hard wearing half T7 so it's not going to be hard with T9 level gear.<br />
(some of the bosses still won't be facerollable but the margin of error in doing the strat right will still be quite big)</div></div><hr />

Can we expect Cataclysm to be released in like a year?<br />
EDIT:<br />
Considering this,<br />
Burning Crusade was released about 14 months after being announced<br />
Wrath of the Lich King was released 15-16 months after announcement, it was announced 8 months after BC release<br />
Cataclysm follows the trend, announced at the first following BlizzCon.<br />
<br />
So.. judging from previous expansions and time between major patches, it's [Cataclysm] probably atleast a year away.<br />
Hard to tell.<br />
<br />
Also, since they're already adding totems for the new race-shaman combos, is it likely that we will be able to roll the new combos (getting to 80 before Cataclysm ships) in the pre-release patch? Kinda like getting new tier of talents before being able to level (BC, WotLK did this)</div></div><hr />

There's no reason to believe that there will be a 3.4. <br />

<br />
With the new emblem tier and and the way to get the emblems only taking 20-30 minutes a week, we gain 2-4 extra hours a week of free time since we're not farming heroics for emblems of triumph any longer. <br />

Maybe I assumed too much, didn't think of the fact that 2.4 was quite a &quot;filler&quot; patch, your link tells me there will only be a 3.4 if Cataclysm get's delayed.<br />
Well, if we're seeing Cataclysm &quot;soon&quot;, within 6 months I'll jump with joy. :3<br />
