Thanks for the feedback and thoughts so far.<br />
<br />
The Refer-A-Friend system is intended as an option for players who want to invite a friend to play WoW with them and experience the game together. When it was first introduced, we gave it a hefty bonus to experience gain as a way for both players to reach endgame content as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, purchasing the latest WoW expansion includes a free character boost, so the need to rush your friend to max level is no longer there; you can jump into the latest content with your friend right away. This meant that the only players who were using the Refer-A-Friend system in its intended way – leveling alongside their friend – were those who had decided that they wanted to experience that content together. We realized that, for those players, the 300% XP bonus was a disservice; we were cutting that shared experience short by making them finish it far too quickly.<br />
<br />
Now, we certainly recognize that the majority of people using the Refer-A-Friend system before these changes were doing so in order to level alts quickly. If anything, we take that as a strong indication that the system needed to change: the best method to level a character in WoW shouldn’t be “buy a new copy of the game, put it on a separate account, send it a Refer-A-Friend invite, level a new character, and then transfer that character to your primary account when you’re finished.” That’s messy, at best.<br />
<br />
That said, we’re certainly taking the feedback about the rate of leveling alts into account as we move forward with the game’s development. We’ve been happy with the changes so far, but if leveling is too slow, we’d rather address that in the game itself than have Refer-A-Friend be some kind of bizarre workaround to an outstanding issue.</div></div><hr />

I bought the RAF on two accounts just for this. I then bought a third account to boost to 100 to drag them through dungeons till 90. Personally, I think everyone should just start at 98 or something in new expansion. Will be more people in the zones with auto-scaling in effect. You learn absolutely nothing while levelling after 1st character. It's just a slog.</div></div><hr />

I love when people refuse to read.<br />
<br />
No, they're not trying to push boosts by nerfing recruit a friend. Recruit a Friend isn't your personal leveling tool and should never have been used that way.<br />
<br />
Frankly, they should have done this years ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frankly, I've been ignoring MMO-Champion for awhile, but I've had nothing but positive opinions about the patch, which is rare for me.<br />
<br />
I leveled a priest up to 15 through Tirisfal Glades. I always finish that zone anyway, and normally don't get much past 13. So that was a net gain in XP.<br />
<br />
I then ran a dungeon as a warrior tank, at 27. I got almost two full levels from BFD, and that's with only one optional boss kill.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I don't care how long it takes to get to max level, as long as you actually have to play the game a little while on the way there. And even just a slight health increase has done exactly that to the game, and that's more than enough.<br />
<br />
The slowed experience has also just made everything feel smoother instead of instantaneous. Yeah, it's a shock to the system compared to pre-nerf, but I don't consider it bad because of that.</div></div><hr />

Boosts are too expensive, and every move you've made regarding leveling in 7.3.5 pushes current players into buying boosts to level alts.

<br />
This has been the case for the past two expansions.<br />
<br />
There has never been any reason to doubt BfA would include a boost. (Except naysayers saying &quot;but they're pushing boosts&quot; which has always been based on flimsy premises to begin with)</div></div><hr />

<br />
What does hairloom exp have to do with leveling with friends? If you raf your both at 50% so you don’t put level each other.<br />
<br />
And you said it your self why are boost 60 bucks? If they wanted to sell more they could cut the price and many more people would buy them. The selling boost argument just doesn’t make any sense as boost have been in for a while and they haven’t changed the leveling speed till they are going to release an expan with rewards for leveling the normal way.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't even have to be an easy to get one, 100% bonus exp on a class you already have at max level. 200% for completing lore master. Another 100% when all your classes are at level cap.<br />
<br />
Simple. Give people an option to turn the exp rates off and boom. Everyone is happy.</div></div><hr />

The funny part is, is I feel this is just players bitching to bitch. Please, if you use this system, show proof. I bet most cant because they aren't using it. Its more a cause of bitching just because its been the new, cool thing to do for a few years now.</div></div><hr />

Hierlooms and RaF no longer stack in experience gain. IE if you have hierlooms, you really don't gain any increased XP with RaF.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LolFrank</div><div class="date">2018-01-23, 07:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everybody complaining the leveling time has either been spoiled by the poorly scaled ability and overly valued heirloom version of leveling or is taking advice from a handful of complainers and considering it as gospel. I've leveled a character with the new system, and didn't take me much time to get to 90. I did one dungeon and that was RFC. Only because I wanted to actually take the time to quest and finish out the chapters of each zone because doing the dungeon grind defeated the purpose of making an alt today when you have over 35 100-110 characters .<br />
<br />
I truly believe that the scaling is better than jumping from zone to zone because it takes away the travel time of going to a new zone due to outleveling the quests. I stayed in Elwynn Forest until 13, Westfall until 20, Redridge until 25, Upper STV until 32, etc. You don't waste time checking your facebook, reading pointless repeated threads on MMO-C, talking in general or trade chat... you ACTUALLY level. You'll get to 90-100 in a couple of DAYS. It's baffling that people think the new leveling system has a wide margin of time taken to level in comparison to the old system. It's not that bad, and is actually fun if you haven't quested to completion for that zone.</div></div><hr />

The illusion of choice is not choice. This is the exact same as the flying argument.<br />
<br />
If you have the option to fly, you will always use it. Period. There will never be reason not to use it when your entire group is waiting on you to speed things up, and that same group will kick you if you are too slow. In a single player environment there's no problem. WoW is not a single player environment, and should not be confused with one.<br />
<br />
There is no reason to give the option to level faster when the intention is to make the leveling experience more enjoyable.

Hierlooms and RaF no longer stack in experience gain. IE if you have hierlooms, you really don't gain any increased XP with RaF.<br />
<br />
So if you have hairlooms you don’t have to worry about gear and you don’t out level your friend. Pretty sure that’s the point.<br />

My question remains: who asked for this change to Recruit a Friend in the first place ?<br />

Blizzard did.</div></div><hr />

'We' have not been over this - Maybe you have, but I haven't talked about this at all.<br />
<br />
A boost is not a 'setting,' it's a 'skip' button.<br />
<br />
If you feel like skipping the experience all power to you. You had that power before, you have that power now, it doesn't even cost any more money than previously, so if anything it's more worth it to people who don't have time to level.<br />
<br />
I on the other hand very much enjoy the new leveling, which takes almost the exact same amount of time as before. We've removed a harmful element from the game. The experience is actually a game again instead of a wall. I'd prefer it stayed that way. I'm actually more likely to level my characters again than buy boosts to skip the tedium.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't make any sense... You say that people want the fastest way possible, but a skip button doesn't count?<br />

<br />
If skipping is an option... Why can't fast forward also be an option?<br />
<br />
Because skipping isn't experiencing the content. You can skip the content, but fast forwarding the content directly changes how the content is played.<br />
<br />
You wouldn't fast forward through a movie and claim to have watched it, or know anything that happens in it. But if you read the sparknotes you will know all the important events, and will be able to talk about it as though you watched it.<br />
<br />
It's the same as the flying argument, once again. They made Legion content to be experienced from the ground, not to fly in it. That's why we couldn't fly in Legion content until they decided to turn it on and after pathfinder. They want you to experience the content the way they design it, not in your own 90x normal pace version.<br />
<br />
WoW is, first and foremost, an RPG. It should play like an RPG, not a que simulator.<br />

I agree, so if you don't want to change the way the content is played, put in that option for people... But people who want to fast forward clearly don't care about the content being changed, because they are the same type of people who would skip it, they just don't want to pay 60 dollars.<br />

Because you aren't the target of this change. Why have you not already leveled to death if you've been playing since you were 14?<br />
<br />
This is for new players. New players are few and far between, and were immediately turned off by how quickly you were meant to level through the old content.<br />
<br />
You don't have to level through the new content. You get a boost with the expansion, you have characters at max level, and you have heirlooms. Literally nothing says &quot;You have to do this.&quot; So if you don't want to - Don't?<br />

Buy account with gold, buy 2 months time with gold (one will be returned via RaF bonus), get a shiny mount for 500k gold.<br />

As for leveling, developers as usual did half arsed job. HP got bigger, danger didn't. Mobs still hit like sissies, making entire thing pointless.

In addition, are you suggesting you can't play WoW at all without social interaction? Because I can tell you that's false. Despite it's claim as an MMO, you can play WoW solo, just can't do all the content. So is it not an MMO because you can do stuff alone?</div></div><hr />

No, saying social interaction isn't part of gameplay is like saying you don't have to be on voice chat to play Call of Duty. Which you don't.<br />
<br />
Call of Duty is an MMOFPS. This suggest to you that you'll be playing in first person and using guns. There will be a massive number of people playing, and it's online.<br />

<br />
if, as blizz say: &quot;the best method to level a character in WoW shouldn’t be “buy a new copy of the game, put it on a separate account, send it a Refer-A-Friend invite, level a new character, and then transfer that character to your primary account when you’re finished.” That’s messy, at best.&quot;<br />
<br />
kind of suggests that the price of boosts is too high. as you get a free boost when you buy the latest expansion anyways. boosts should cost the same as the game. otherwise blizz are just kind of re-enforcing this idea of RaF'ing yourself instead of just buying a boost.</div></div><hr />

I get a lot of people used this for alts to speed level, but if the problem is rate of xp gain, they outright say they need to look at the solution as an in game change rather than an out of game one. Character boosts aren't in game changes, they are just as out of game as RAF. Blizz could do a lot with this wrong, sure. They also could be telling the truth and people are just reacting angrily to something that, short term, affects them negatively.<br />
<br />
So we can conclude: the leveling system is shit and with their changes it only got &quot;better&quot; so they now have to come out and defend their action because they got massive backslash...<br />

<br />
Typically, MMOs contain their population in a large space they can possible interact and aid eachother in. Destin technically counts due to how its drop in drop out patrol zones, coop matchmaking, and social spaces work. Wow has a large world map (several really) in which players interact and see other players. Call of duty is not an MMO until arguably the most recent one, ww2, in which they have the social space training ground. But as that ground does nothing to advance gameplay for people, it is more mmo-lite than mmo, since the majority of the game content is not based in similar spaces like that training ground.</div></div><hr />

They really don’t seem to be in crisis mode, they said it was fine and they’d fix it if they thought it was a problem and that RAF has lost it’s true use over the years. All of which seems like statement of facts to me not trying to solve a crisis.</div></div><hr />

Or you could be overreacting to them saying &quot;we're trying to fix recruit a friend so it's used the way it's meant to be used. If leveling is too slow without it, we'll make changes in game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Literally the last paragraph says that. They in no way claim it's outright better other than saying that they're happy &quot;so far&quot;. But if feedback shows it is too slow, they will change it. They had a lot of positive hype around the leveling changes in ptr, so they didn't change it. Now that it's live, it's a lot of negative responses. As players, us complaining about them acting on ptr feedback as the feedback was given is like complaining about the result of a vote without us having ever voted ourselves. If there's a problem, it will be fixed. Changes like this take time to balance out so they don't go overboard and make it way too fast. The whole change to leveling was to help make leveling an enjoyable experience, not a grind. A lot of people like the changes. If you don't, you weren't the target audience of that change.</div></div><hr />

You don't just dissect an abbreviation into separate words and apply them separately into one thing. There is an definition behind the abbreviation as a whole.<br />
<br />
MMO is something that has a lot of players playing in the same server simultaneously.<br />
<br />
You can't just say Ping Pong is an MMO when a lot of people play it against each other in the internet, as an example. That's absurd, and makes the term completely meaningless.<br />

Not to try and stir anything up, but you realize that no matter what the response to this question is you will just say that that's not a MMO because your definition includes persistent world. You both clearly have different definitions of the term. I personally wouldn't include CoD as a MMO, but I would consider Destiny as a MMOFPS. I think the entire point though is that MMO doesn't define a genre, which it doesn't. It's a category at best. For instance Horror Movie, Horror would be the genre (i.e. it will scare you) Movie would be the category (you will watch it). MMORPG, RPG is the genre (i.e. you will role play a character) and MMO is the category (i.e. you will be playing online with a large number of other players simultaneously).</div></div><hr />

You would call it Multiplayer though; and I believe a typical CoD match has far more people playing and in each individual match (ie massively multiplayer).

They are maybe doing work in the wrong areas right now, but i can atleast feel that they are doing all this for a good purpose. Tbh, the RAF was not really used by that many people, so i don't think this is gonna have ANY effect on the grand populis.<br />
<br />
<br />
The message in itself is actually saying alot of what we should expect of Blizzard in the future. They say, that the reason why this happends is because they are looking toward making leveling a fun experience, not in creating ways to cheat through the system and maybe give new players a bad first experience with going too fast. This i support, i agree that leveling should be as fun and as engageing as possible.<br />
<br />
BUT!... Blizzard needs to show, that they mean this. They need to stay dedicated to the leveling experience, keep updating and improving it every now and then. Especially when it comes to experience gain. Sure, i agree, that the leveling experience should be a long journey, where you learn to play your class one ability at a time, but then they really have to make it so, that there are more leveling rewards for leveling up each lvl. Some classes have nothing new to see in spands of 10-15 lvls and those spands are really what makes people say &quot;meh, nothing new happends, nothing new is given to me outside gear with 1-2 more stats every now and then, so i think i will quit now&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizz is going the right way, they just need to keep going and not sit down and wait.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Questing is pointless, you outlevel zones long before you're ready to leave them meaning you're devoting a good chunk of time to moving between zones on the ground until level 70 when you're allowed to fly again. Or you're sitting in a dungeon queue to run Sunken Temple 4 times until you outlevel that dungeon bracket since it's still faster than actually getting down to Swamp of Sorrows and leveling there twice in a singular hub before packing up and moving onto the next map. <br />
<br />
Fast forward past that to what's really happening at the end of the road. You hit 110 on that new alt you've just painstakingly leveled, then the icing on the cake is you've just got your first two legendaries, check warcraftlogs and realize that absolutely no one uses either of them and you'll be farming wailing essences for the next 3 months before your alt isn't garbage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Boosts are too expensive, and every move you've made regarding leveling in 7.3.5 pushes current players into buying boosts to level alts. Why the hell is it $60, the price of the retail game, to get a character boosted in a game you also pay a monthly sub on, and also have to purchase expansions for every couple years?<br />
<br />
Boosts are supposed to be expensive, so you only get one if you really really want/need it. <br />
<br />
If they cost €1 they could easily disable everything pre-expansion and nobody would notice. They could make it €1000 and nobody would buy it.<br />
<br />
No matter what price point they pick, someone is going to say it's too cheap and another is going to say it's too expensive. €60 is fine for people with jobs (NEETs not so much). <br />

As it is, however, it just looks like a cover-up for forcing more people to buy the $60 character boost. Please Blizzard, if you really care about the leveling experience at all, keep this change that you've made AND remove the paid character boost... and maybe even the free boosts that come with expansions.<br />
<br />
I get that it's supposed to make the game more accessible for new/returning players, but that is 100% in opposition to the language you used in patch claiming that people weren't experiencing the leveling process properly. If it comes down to the viewpoint that the leveling experience is &quot;optional&quot; for those willing to pay more money, then I still don't see the reason for this patch, as the RaF system, even if abused, would still be considered optional.<br />
<br />
Again, this patch would have been amazing without the boosts still being an option, but as it stands, it just looks like a way of punishing players that were spending money on RaF to acquire a few extra max level characters by putting forth ANY effort (albeit very little with triple XP, but still more than clicking a button on a cash shop). I hate to imagine that Blizzard actually has the mindset of &quot;those RaF players are getting 5 characters for $60, but they should be paying $300!&quot; but unfortunately, with the systems in place as they are, it's hard to not see that side of it.</div></div><hr />

Not something you just had automatically granted when rolling a new toon. <br />
<br />
If you detest leveling so much you want a level 100 toon right away and want the P2W route just wait till legions on sale and buy a second copy, there's another 100 boost at a third of the price of a store purchased boost to use on on your main account.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renuts</div><div class="date">2018-01-24, 12:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm probably the only person who has posted in this thread, who has never even used a level boost. I literally still have my level 90 boost, and my level 100 boost. This isn't because I don't like them, it's because I actually like leveling. However, the difference between myself, and others who have relentlessly argued their flawed logic for 6 pages, is that I don't pretend that my way is the only way this game should be enjoyed. Many people already have leveled through the world many many many times. They don't care for it, and its utterly absurd that people believe making them do it longer is somehow the best solution for everyone.<br />
<br />
I may be the only person in the world who still has both of their free boosts. I respect whatever opinion you have, but acting like everyone else needs to play the same way you do, is a bit egotistical. Blizzard is doing unpopular things, some people like it, most people don't. The double standard exists in their arguments, and the backlash is unprecedented. You can't nerf xp gains, and ignore other xp gains, and then claim it's because you're trying to improve the experience. You're catering to those who enjoy leveling, and you're punishing those who do not, period.<br />
<br />
The logic Blizzard has chosen to actually share with us is flawed. I'm honestly annoyed that people seem to think that the people who do not enjoy leveling are somehow deserving of this punishment. This game is nearly 15 years old. People are allowed to enjoy it the way they want to. It's not like they don't pay a subscription, and they have likely paid Blizzard an absurd amount of money already. Let them level fast without having to spend an absurd amount of money on a boost.<br />
<br />
Those like me who enjoy leveling, can sit on their free boosts, and choose to level up. Those who do not enjoy leveling, should be able to choose to do so at a faster rate without needing to fork over an arm and a leg on another boost. The people who are shaming those who do not enjoy the game the way they do, are doing a disservice to the community. This game is huge, it spans millions of people, and it has a ton of different types of content. Not everyone enjoys PvP or PvE, and visa versa. It's childish to insist that everyone needs to enjoy leveling up the same way you do. Learn some empathy, or don't act surprised when you post for 6 freaking pages and everyone is tired of hearing you talk.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no reason to give the option to level faster when the intention is to make the leveling experience more enjoyable. In a multiplayer game, everyone needs to be on the same setting or the only setting will be &quot;The fastest possible.&quot; This is harmful to the game, no matter how many people 'like it that way.'<br />
I completely disagree with you, I've read this entire thread and you were already annoying me on page 2.</div></div><hr />

It's only taken them like 8 years to realise people had been abusing the system to level alts/earn rewards. :D In the next 10 years or so we should expect some unexpected changes towards multiboxers, when they realise it's been pure system abuse. Well this is already a little too late, but it's a nerf aimed at multiboxers. In the past we didn't have multi tap system for herb / ore nodes. Blizzard implemented one to help average player who felt while he fought a mob next to a node, some douche zipped by and stole it. Side effect? Multiboxer herbing / mining parties getting heaps of herbs and ore at multiple the rate ordinary player can. Which ruins the gathering professions for a casual player, because prices are driven to the ground. Nerfing multi tap would harm casual player. So what can you nerf? The rate at which multiboxers can produce additional toons. Therefore RAF nerf. RAF was often used in a way people would link 2 accounts then dungeon boost it with 3rd. Sadly the damage has been done, people already produced their armies of alts. And I mean literal armies. Not talking about a guy who has a handful of alts to experience different classes / races / factions. Talking about people with 50+ toons used to farm gold. These aren't &quot;toons&quot; or &quot;characters&quot;, these are faceless slaves. You can go any day to Suramar, queue a group for world quest and watch army of druids / dks / dhs realm hop to mass farm herbs and ore. And now imagine the guy behind it isn't sitting on 1 account, but on multiples, farming 10x faster than anyone else.</div></div><hr />

A branching questline that unlocks in every starting zone, for all characters, upon getting your main to maxlevel.<br />
<br />
Something along : «You’re a new reqruit but recommended by [name of main], let’s train you and run you through scaled solo scenarios of old raids that will teach you your abilities by pitting you against brawler-esque bosses, and take you to max-level-minus-2-expansions in 6-7 hours»<br />
<br />
Or, even better, remove all levels after wotlk. 80 is max level, all new content is lvl 80. Endgame is 90% of all content instead of having 90% of all content being irrellevant due to outleveling it.</div></div><hr />

The problem with leveling was outleveling the areas (quests go gray) and DGs outperforming anything else in the game for XP.<br />
<br />
No need to massively increase combat times (it's ok that a combat takes extra time against a mini boss/named mob from a quest, but for normal mobs, considering the amount of filler quests, it's really bad) as the problem should be fixed basically by scalling the quests and removing the big XP from DGs.<br />
<br />
You stay as long as you want in an area, you do DGs to finish a quest line/area story (grab 1-2 levels while at it thx to the one time only quests, no problem) and that's it.<br />

That's what the pre-expansion Legion Invasion (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Legion_Invasions) world event was.<br />
<br />
Each invasion would easily get you like 5 levels, and they took no time at all to complete. You could login between multiple alts and complete each invasion that popped up every couple of hours. I leveled about a dozen alts from various levels to max over the course of that world event.<br />
<br />
I do kind of wish they kept them active as a permanent fixture throughout the whole expansion, even with dramatically reduced XP rewards, just as a means to squeeze out some extra EXP every few hours and to make it feel like the Legion was still a persistent threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still, if you're lucky, maybe they'll do another similar world event for BfA that awards a ton of EXP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
5 mobs at a time * 150 xp = 750 xp per pull, which even if you let every agony tick to completion, is a maximum of 30 seconds. Which also completes your quests, while the rogue is likely not pulling anything that isn't a quest mob, and is killing one at a time. DoT class finishes the quest faster, and gets more XP for doing so.<br />
<br />
It's not in question that dot classes do better than single target classes when it comes to how fast they can level. Quite frankly, it's just not a problem, and definitely not nearly as big a problem as that person who said it's 'hell on earth' claims it is.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, I agree that it shouldn't stack with heirlooms since the recruiter would draw away because of it, if they only play together. I have mixed feelings. The system was broken but it could stay the way it was as an option. They shouldn't have slowed the leveling in the first place. It has become like iOS.

<br />
Nerf RAF to the ground, take the XP bonus away completely, I don't mind! Keep the convenience stuff like the summons etc. When I am grouped with my friend we enjoy the leveling experience.<br />
<br />
On the side, introduce new heirlooms for our missing slots and bring our bonus xp up to 300% WHEN NOT GROUPED WITH A RAF FRIEND. So the bonus can go away when we group with a friend.

<br />
If you have the option to fly, you will always use it. Period. There will never be reason not to use it when your entire group is waiting on you to speed things up, and that same group will kick you if you are too slow. In a single player environment there's no problem. WoW is not a single player environment, and should not be confused with one.<br />
<br />
There is no reason to give the option to level faster when the intention is to make the leveling experience more enjoyable. In a multiplayer game, everyone needs to be on the same setting or the only setting will be &quot;The fastest possible.&quot; This is harmful to the game, no matter how many people 'like it that way.'<br />
<br />
And just like the no fly argument this is complete bull, they shouldn't punish everyone because some people lack the force of will to play the game the way they supposedly like. If one group of people will kick you for your play style find others that won't if there are no groups that like your play style maybe blizzard shouldn't be catering the game to you.<br />
<br />
Making the game slower isn't going to make it more enjoyable for everyone because enjoyable is subjective, so why do I have to suffer just so you can be forced into &quot;Enjoying&quot; the game. Judging by how this group of people needs ease of access removed to have fun I wouldn't be surprised if LFR needs to be cut next because &quot;well it was making the raiding experience to easy, when it's to easy people don't want to do harder difficulties.&quot;, then it will be random BG's, then it's pet battles. How much content dose blizzard need to cut/nerf/destroy before you can be properly forced into your ideal fun scenario? <br />
<br />
You aren't going to bring many if any people back to the game by making old and used content slower, you are going to demotivate the people who liked the old system from doing it again, and the kicker here is that the people who wanted a more cohesive experience already had their issue fixed when they made zones scale.....<br />
<br />
You don't like the illusion of choice, your answer is to just remove all choice.</div></div><hr />

Making the game slower isn't going to make it more enjoyable for everyone because enjoyable is subjective, so why do I have to suffer just so you can be forced into &quot;Enjoying&quot; the game. Judging by how this group of people needs ease of access removed to have fun I wouldn't be surprised if LFR needs to be cut next because &quot;well it was making the raiding experience to easy, when it's to easy people don't want to do harder difficulties.&quot;, then it will be random BG's, then it's pet battles. How much content dose blizzard need to cut/nerf/destroy before you can be properly forced into your ideal fun scenario? <br />
<br />
You aren't going to bring many if any people back to the game by making old and used content slower, you are going to demotivate the people who liked the old system from doing it again, and the kicker here is that the people who wanted a more cohesive experience already had their issue fixed when they made zones scale.....<br />
<br />
You don't like the illusion of choice, your answer is to just remove all choice.<br />
<br />
If the choice is &quot;Don't play or play our way&quot; then the choice doesn't actually exist to begin with. Hence illusion of choice. You pretend there was ever an option, but if we take the option you don't agree with we are actively punished for it and can't play the game.<br />
<br />
Removing the completely irrelevant 'choice' from the equation is the most sensible way to deal with that. Especially when the 'choice' is &quot;Play the game the way the game was built to be played&quot; or &quot;Play the game on fast forward.&quot;</div></div><hr />

This is a very reasonable and compelling argument. You provided the appropriate context, demonstrated well defined and clear points, and you cited many different examples. Well said, I completely agree with you.<br />

<br />
It's absurd that people seem to think their preferred way is the only way to &quot;respectably&quot; play the game. There is more than one way to test your talent and ability, while you enjoy this game. I just don't get why this is so difficult for some people to accept. Some of you act like if somebody doesn't play the way you do, they are somehow inadequate and should be ashamed that they aren't more like you. The whole argument that leveling up fast is somehow &quot;cheap&quot; is absurd. As if the difficulty leveling up is in anyway comparable to the end game content most of these people are trying to get to faster. You guys behave like you are somehow purists who are the only ones who value the game the &quot;right&quot; way. Have you ever stopped to think that there are millions of other people who enjoy different things, and don't find the leveling process challenging, or valuable in the ways that you do? I don't care how long you have played, or how things were &quot;supposed to be&quot; for you at some point. I played this game while it was still in Beta, and I take my sweet time to nerd out on the lore while I level up. That doesn't mean that this is the only way to play this game correctly. <br />
<br />
So much arrogance...... could some of you folks possibly be any more vain? I really wish more people would practice acceptance, and actually make the effort to coexist with other players in the community. Blizzard is making the effort to provide a more meaningful experience for new players, and you're perpetuating the kinds of division in the community that likely repels more new players from this game, than the previous leveling experience ever could. Everybody gets it, you love the new changes. Why must you celebrate this while bashing the players who don't like these changes over the head?<br />
<br />
And I guess the fact that I leveled up some characters without using my free boosts, or that I chose not to use heirlooms on some of my characters means that I never actually had any choice at all....... Oops, I forgot to put it in bold letters so it must not be true! If you're going to pick one sentence out of a well authored post, and ignore everything else to argue your subjective nonsense, then perhaps you should ask yourself why it is you are posting in the first place. Good lord, what is it that drives someone to be so pigheaded?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, and no. This would help with the &quot;immersion&quot; that they want to fulfill as the first few times a 5-10% bonus won't really make much of a difference at all but after you've leveled say 5-6 toons you can get bored of doing the same thing over and at least this would help with the pacing.<br />
<br />
I mean, there are plenty of solutions. Ie., change rest xp to apply to quests as well for instance, more heirloom gear or a currency to allow you to buy xp bonus potions so that it's a way to opt-into getting a more streamlined leveling experience for those who want it. The current changes are not balances to achieve this, since people were willing to buy another copy to dual box and get the RAF bonus xp... it's an overhaul.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that is the exact series of options you give people who don't want to play your way.... No matter how hard you try and twist it, your option IS &quot;my way or the high way&quot;. my option may be a case of an in most cases clearly better and worse option but it IS still an option, at no point is anything bard from someone wanting to use a ground mount. If you're to slow most people just summon you to a dungeons / raids now, no profession needs so many materials that only someone with flying can ever hope to succeeded in their chosen field, and your world is just as big as the person who flies over it so you're not getting less content. <br />
<br />
It's the same deal with leveling, at this stage in the game nearly everyone has a max level toon so it's not like you cant head the call of friends/guildies trying to start a run of something. Past that I have never met any group who would remove you because you aren't leveling fast enough for them. its usually quite to opposite where if someone out levels your group they will leave in search of greener meadows. at that point your argument comes down to a scale of levels pir hour and what you think is acceptable, and everything past what you deem worthy needs be removed. No one wants to leave you high and dry when it comes to a slower leveling option you should be allowed that option if it truly makes you happy, in return be willing to have options for thoughs of us who do not care to be hindered by a &quot;gradual pace&quot; leveling experience. No choice is irrelevant if someone enjoys it.</div></div><hr />
