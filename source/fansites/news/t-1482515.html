Warlords of Draenor - Profession Catch Up<br />
At Blizzcon and in previous interviews, the developers mentioned that profession catch up mechanisms would be nice to have. It looks like Warlords of Draenor might add those catch up mechanism, as hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome) shared some plans recently.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/march/wodProf.png (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/447104103852683264) <br />
<br />
<br />
Battle.Net Desktop App - Chat Coming Soon<br />
We should see the Battle.Net App enable chat (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3273-Battle-net-Desktop-Client-Services-Activated-and-Beta-Test-Opt-in) sometime soon, as we recently got an update that let us know it is almost ready! <br />
Soon, soon!<br />
<br />
We initially were going to enable chat before the Diablo 3 expansion launch, but due to some unforeseen issues it had to be delayed.<br />
<br />
To ensure the stability of the Diablo 3 expansion launch, we've postponed it until after.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
With Hit/Exp gone, what will the new incentive be for melee to stay behind the boss/mob to DPS?<br />
It's more like the stats are gone from items and everyone gets a passive +7.5% to both. You can still get parried from the front. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439705200740167680))<br />
Chance to be parried will be 0%/0%/1.5%/3%, against a +0/+1/+2/+3 level target. (Bosses are +3) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/439834754767007744))<br />
are inanimate objects like siege crafter weapons still going to parry?<br />
That's encounter-specific, and we generally disable parry where it makes no sense. We missed belt weapons. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439843230020927488))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
You mentioned once before about flex modes possibly flexing up to 30 people. That still on the table or still only 25 flex max?<br />
Still on the table. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440561429918138368))<br />
30 sounds great. A mythic guild can fit in its entire roster. Still think distributed loot should be mythic only.<br />
Why? Just to stop week one split main/alt loot-funneling runs? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440617747454521345))<br />
agree with about the 30 size being good so no one from roster needing to be left out, disagree with loot thinking.<br />
I'd love to stop week 1 loot funneling, but not at the expense of a social loot experience for the majority. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440619110825607169))<br />
In my experience week 1 loot funneling is a problem with very few guilds. Most won't even do it.<br />
Yeah, plenty of 14/14H guilds don't do any of that. It's a niche problem. It does suck though. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440623156609294336))<br />
<br />
How would this affect loot drops if raid loot is in affect? I'm assuming 30 people would cause more loot drops than 25 or 20?<br />
Right, with 30 you'd see 50% more loot on average than with 20. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440573803651792896))<br />
So loot per raid size it'll be: 8-19 people: 1 token + 1 item, 20-29 people: 2 tokens +2 items, 30 people: 3 tokens + 3 items?<br />
No breakpoints like that. The idea is for loot : player ratio to be constant. We'll have more details to share in the future. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440589246278025217))<br />
<br />
Challenge mode raiding? 6.1 feature? Sounds good to me<br />
Who's the audience for that feature? Seems like it'd be just the tiny sliver of players that has cleared the current Mythic tier. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439800972894674944))<br />
<br />
Why are they separated into two raids now, as opposed to three? Any particular design reasons?<br />
HoF/ToES split was a bit awkward, especially for the gating, and 10 bosses lets Foundry feel like more of an epic end to the tier. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439045053860683776))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
So what about resil and battle fatigue? is it going away?<br />
.Base resil and battle fatigue will be made as low as good gameplay will allow. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439277167797473280))<br />
Our goal is to have health pools scale along side damage so we don't have to constantly bump them up. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439277303747448832))<br />
If there is 2 dps for every health bar, doesnt that mean damage scales 2x faster then health? Wont the ratio change?<br />
Example: Backstab does 10% of health in first season, 20% in last season. Not really a bracket thing. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/439283595392200704))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Can't recall if this was answered elsewhere, but is there a reason Drums of Rage aren't usable in Challenge Modes? Thanks <br />
We generally bar the use of items/advantages added after the introduction of CMs. Drums should be usable in WoD CMs. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440627988334268416))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
and if you don't know, find out.. why are there Ruby Guardians in Grim Batol<br />
Lorewise, Grim Batol was guarded by the red dragonflight before it was retaken by the Twilight's Hammer and black dragonflight. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/440113949187375104))<br />
<br />
World<br />
will wod have a lot of timeless Isle style interaction all over draenor?<br />
Absolutely! From levelling to endgame, we're all about dynamic content and choosing the difficulty that's right for you! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442169473638756356))<br />
<br />
Would a system with XP bonuses for killing mobs well above your level be possible? There could be issues with high level carries..<br />
How about an XP bonus for taking on a tough elite or rare in the zone? Doesn't need to be high level to be difficult! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442500674345922560))<br />
Would be also cool if rare elites would drop some transmog gear. For example, rare elites in Talador drop shoulder pads and so on<br />
Used to be worried about inventory space with too many toys and fun stuff, Warlords UI revamp helps a ton! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/442895965679124481))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor<br />
Hey Ion, just curious about something: will there be daily quests at max level in Warlords too? Not a lot but I do enjoy them.<br />
Daily quests will certainly exist in various forms, but they won't be the backbone of endgame outdoor content as they were in MoP (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/439040821711478784))<br />
<br />
Any chance you can reduce ground spell effects, proc effects and visual &quot;clutter&quot; in melee? Hard to spot char and target facing<br />
Yes. We have big plans to solve this; it's a big problem to us. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442223769604472832))<br />

it happened to me literally 30 minutes ago, I saw a friend online on the app so I had to log in WoW to tell him something, the second I logged another friend asked for my help in a raid, I felt so bad turning him down but I had to explain to him for 20 minutes why I logged on in the first place &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Anyway... I'm still not seeing why these &quot;splendiferous dynamic events&quot; require the removal of flying mounts to enjoy properly. Dropping out of the air to do a dynamic event versus rolling up to one on a ground mount are the exact same thing in the end.</div></div><hr />

I might be somewhere between &quot;alone&quot; and &quot;in the minority&quot;, but I hate that island with a passion - more so than Quel'Danas on a PvP server! It's such a useless time sink, imo, with the only carrot being rare drops (pets/mounts/items) that have a horrible drop rate. As a new 90 the mobs are a challenge (and rightfully so!), but as a geared 90 all it is is a grind for... for... for nothing that helps you in-game!<br />
Sure, I dabble in collecting pets and mounts, but the time to invest, especially if you have an alt or two that you want to do anything with, seems quite excessive for the rewards.<br />
I guess the only thing that was worse was grinding goblin cartel rep to exalted by killing pirates as melee.</div></div><hr />

He made a statement as fact. With no source to back it up. So yes, he was full of bullshit. I don't think we'll see the beta till June, but I have no source for this, because it's a guess not a statement of fact.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making it so you can level herbing and mining strictly in pandaria made it less painful than having to circle for example: Hellfire for fel iron. Since crz that particular part of mining could take hours if you were unlucky. And then black smithing can be leveled off of all ghost iron. Sure you still gotta level the 600 levels but having a single source can greatly reduce travel time. Some old school mats can be hard to come by or expensive so it's a nice QoL change. Granted I already leveled em all but I'm more inclined to put profs on some alts with this.</div></div><hr />

I raided, in a leadership position, semi-hardcore in Vanilla (we didn't come close to clearing AQ40 and never touched Naxx, but did have the whole mandatory schedule going) and I will say, Vanilla was not the best. All phases of WoW have had strong and weak points. As a historian I consciously filter for &quot;good old days&quot; bias. Most people don't and many aren't even aware it exists.<br />

(Summoning water for a 40 man raid 4 at a time was not fun)</div></div><hr />

Especially when a required mat is something made by another profession - such as tough leather for a tailoring pattern. Sometimes it is hard to find that item on the AH. I enjoyed the DLC, particularly the literal asshat.</div></div><hr />

As much as I enjoyed Vanilla (May 2005), I've very thankful for all the QoL changes we've gotten over the years. There are times I would like to go back to Vanilla &amp; BC style raiding, but that is mostly because I have a lazy streak and can remember a time when we weren't constantly running and moving on every single boss.</div></div><hr />

It's not hard (though not sure what having sex has to do with it) nor does it take a very long time, so you are correct on both of those points. I would counter with the fact that the professions leveling process is completely pointless and retarded to attempt to do while leveling. On those grounds alone it needs to be overhauled. Also, are you saying that those children born out of wedlock are lazily having sex? or just that they are lazy because they are having so much sex? Trying to figure out your adjectives. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Think about it dufus,more gear to collect = more bag space which we are severely dying from right now,i have literally 12 slots of space free and its been like this for months,my void storage is full,my bank is full and my bags are all 26 slots,my only saving grace is some items i can keep that arent soulbound can go in my own guild bank for added storage,but thats only a temporary solution.</div></div><hr />

I would disagree. Almost all of the gathering professions are easily done while leveling (although more in instance herbs and nodes are needed and the cast time needs greatly reduced). Leatherworking and tailoring and perhaps blacksmithing are easily doable while leveling (granted blacksmithing should have smelting combined into it). JC is a hitch due to drop rates of special mats. Inscription is doable. I have never really done alchemy, so I cannot comment.</div></div><hr />
