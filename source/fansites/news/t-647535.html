The current arena rating system allows more players to have higher ratings in the 2v2 bracket when compared to 3v3 and 5v5. We are preparing an in-game update that will be improving the rating system of the 3v3 and 5v5 brackets to allow all three of the brackets to have a similar number of players able to achieve ratings on par with what’s currently possible in our 2v2 arena bracket. As a result, we are changing the personal and team rating requirements for the item level 239 weapons from 2200 to 2350, but keep in mind the tooltip will continue to show the requirement as 2200 until patch 3.1.2.<br />
<br />
As a result of the above improvements, this change will prevent an excessive number of players from reaching much higher ratings and acquiring the highest grade of weapons in-game. The increase in rating requirements is designed to keep the number of players able to obtain these arena weapons on par with the number of players who are able to obtain the same grade of weapons from Heroic Ulduar.<br />
<br />
When Arena Season 7 launches we plan to return the highest rated season 7 weapons back to 2200 while also ensuring that the difficulty in achieving that rating is closer to what is intended, yet of similar difficulty for all brackets (rather than being easier for 2v2). <br />

Algalon Loot Table Now Partially Shared with Other Bosses<br />
I already mentionned it yesterday and this is now official, bosses have been hotfixed and now drop Algalon weapons in hard modes. The new loot discovered in the past few days is:<br />
<br />
Constellus (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/may/constellus.jpg) (1H-Mace - Spell MP5) dropped from Hodir in Hard Mode.<br />
Fang of Oblivion (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/may/fangofoblivion.jpg) (1H Dagger - Phys.DPS) dropped from the Iron Council in Hard Mode.<br />
(New) Dreambinder (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/may/dreambinder.jpg) (Staff - Phys.DPS) dropped from Freya in Hard Mode.<br />
(New) Skyforge Crossbow (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/may/skyforgecrossbow.jpg) (Crossbow - Phys.DPS) dropped from Thorim in Hard Mode<br />
<br />
Starshard Edge (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/april/starshardedge.jpg) (Dagger - Spell) and Legplates of the Endless Void (http://www.mmo-champion.com/i/n/09/03/9722/loot_9722_92.jpg) are also part of the Algalon loot table but were datamined on PTR and on the official Armory and might drop from Algalon only. (Until someone proves me wrong) <br />
We made a hotfix yesterday to several hard mode loot tables in order to spread around Algalon's weapon drops to make the items more accessible. Algalon still has loot that is unique to him, but the acquisition of the weapons in Ulduar won't be so soul crushingly difficult and ultimately unfair to certain class/builds.<br />
<br />
So it turns out that we don't hate you.<br />

Hotfixing the game<br />
In both game design and software development, simple changes are usually superior. Complicated changes require more testing, can introduce more bugs, and can have unintended consequences that often aren't seen for months down the road. The simplicity of a change can't trump all other considerations, but it often figures prominently.<br />
<br />
In my experience, &quot;band aid&quot; gets thrown around as a pejorative term when a player had a pet idea of how they thought something should work and is disappointed when we don't implement that solution. These are often, but not always, the same folks who argue that X needs to be totally redesigned or &quot;Blizzard doesn't know what it wants to do with my class.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think sometimes players might also mistakenly conclude from a simple fix that we didn't spend much time exploring the problem or that their problems aren't worth us taking much time out of our busy day.<br />
<br />
Simple changes that are potentially confusing or clearly temporary are not ideal. (I'll use the Exorcism change as an example here with hopes of not derailing the thread.). But at the same time, they do allow us to make a change quickly without having a problem drag on.

Player vs. Player<br />
Classes representation in Arenas<br />
We will continue to work to make sure classes and specs are not too dominant nor too weak in Arena matches. I don't want to turn this thread into a &quot;your class is OP&quot;, &quot;no u&quot; rugby scrum. Hunters are something we are paying close attention to. I don't think it's intuitively obvious if any specific nerfs went too far, or just whether the Arena environment is different now than it was last season. Changing one class often has effects on all the others. It's not as simple as just buffing one or nerfing one because those changes will likely cause another class or comp to rise or fall.

Blizzcon<br />
Blizzcon In-Game item and Goodies Bag<br />
We will likely talk about a goodie bag in-game item in the future (though there are no guarantees of course), but based on the past we don't do this until after the ticket sales and we are much closer to the con happening. Tickets first. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/25/16904263099-ingame-item.html))<br />
<br />
Blizzard Store waiting lines<br />
Honestly we have made improvements on this every year based on the previous year, but it always ends up not quite where we want. If I remember the first BlizzCon right some people were in line for like half the day, so 3-4 hours is technically an improvement - but yeah, we want it to run smoother too so we'll keep working on it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/25/16904262998-blues--four-halls-four-blizzard-stores.html))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Val'anyr proc and RNG<br />
On the issue of the proc being RNG, yes you are correct. RNG is part of the game. You sometimes get a big crit on a heal when you most need it and sometimes you waste those crits. We are not terribly sympathetic to the argument that healing has to be 100% predictable and dependable to be useful. We understand some players would prefer a game with even less emphasis on random elements, but we think random chance (within reason) adds excitement and interest to WoW.<br />
<br />
Non-heals, such as Power Word: Shield, don't contribute to either proc. That is just the way the item is set up. If you are a Disc priest who ends up with Val'anyr, I would suggest trying to maximize your actual heals when the bubble is up. We are going to make the heal provided by the glyph of PW:S able to cause the procs, though typically items that heal will not cause the procs.<br />
<br />
As a few players have pointed out, Thunderfury looked like a pretty mild tanking weapon if you didn't see the proc in action. Like that weapon, you should want Val'anyr for the proc, not the stats. We aren't at all worried that healers capable of acquiring this legendary are going to find it lackluster. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16137530621-explain-valanyr-please.html))<br />
<br />
Race-specific skills for classes<br />
At one point in time priests had some different spells based upon their race. What we found is that it's very difficult to keep the balance in that situation and we tended to get a large number of Dwarven priests on the Alliance side, while getting a decent mix on the Horde side, but slightly favoring Undead. While race is meant to be unique, it's not your class and we don't want it to be a major deciding factor in what race you choose for any given class.<br />
<br />
So, I wouldn't really look for us to head back to that style of class/race synergy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16904295045-race--class-differences.html))<br />

Furor doesn't increase mana<br />
The issue you describe with Furor isn't a bug. It increases your mana pool not your current mana. We don't want you to be able to shift to gain mana.<br />
<br />
Heart of the Wild did have this problem for awhile. We fixed that case by just having it increase mana period and not just in certain forms. Unlike Heart of the Wild, Furor is available to (and often a staple of) many druids. It would just be a buff to Resto and Feral druids.<br />
<br />
It does mean that Furor doesn't really benefit shifting in and out of Moonkin form (say in PvP). For a druid that stays in Moonkin most of the time, it's still a good talent. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904073486-moonkin--typhoon-mana-cost--furor-manabug.html))<br />

Exorcism (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48801) vs. Hunter pets<br />
Exorcism worked on demons and undead before, so the only real change here is versus hunter pets. We don't think this is a gigantic problem given that we've already said we plan to redesign how Exorcism works. If hunters are too weak in Arena, it's unlikely that Exorcism is the cause. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904204830-simple-questions-regarding-balance-direction.html))<br />
<br />
Retribution burst damage<br />
I have answered this recently. We want to make Retribution less about unloading multiple cooldown-restricted abilities all at once. We aren't ready to discuss our specific plan yet or we would have already done so. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16904204830-simple-questions-regarding-balance-direction.html))<br />
<br />

Elemental Shaman Damage<br />
Here are a few possibilities:<br />
<br />
1) There is some bug related to dual-spec. We are fairly confident this is not a problem. It did have some bugs when 3.1 first launched, but we think we have caught them all. Therefore we think this issue is just a red herring complicating the rest of the discussion.<br />
2) Elementals suffered a lot more from losing 5% crit from the Improved Scorch et al. change than did other casters. However, balance druids and some warlocks, also reasonably crit dependent, did not seem to drop.<br />
3) Ulduar fights require a lot more movement, so Elementals can't cast as many spells. (I'm talking about direct damage spells here, not totems.)<br />
4) There is some bug with Lava Burst or another spell that we cannot yet locate. We have looked at this a few times and everything seemed to be working correctly, but we can't completely eliminate this as a problem.<br />
<br />
As I have said in the other, longer thread, we need to understand the cause of the problem before we go making any shotgun style changes that may or may not fix it. I will also point out that the Ulduar set for Elementals is a pretty decent upgrade. You should be in a better relative position with full Ulduar gear than you were with full Naxx gear.

Juggernaut (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=64976) too powerful?<br />
Juggernaut is something we're keeping an eye on. We introduced it specifically to give warriors some much-needed PvP potency and don't want to immediately nerf it back to being a non-entity. <br />

We introduced it specifically to give warriors some much-needed PvP potency and don't want to immediately nerf it back to being a non-entity. [/blizzquote]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;The Exorcism change, largely made so that paladin damage wouldn’t decline once they moved from the undead-rich Naxxramas to the undead-poor Ulduar, gave them extra damage in PvP that we didn’t feel paladins needed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I started with &quot;That's a fair point&quot; because the OP mentioned that paladins have more to contend with than just maximizing damage. They do have heals, bubbles, cleansing and similar mechanics going on. That is why I said we can't take something as complex as a rogue's combat system and shoehorn it in for Ret.<br />
<br />
But we can (and most likely will) change up the basic Seal, Judge, DS, CS, Exorcism buttons so that they can't all be brought to bear at once AND to make pushing those buttons a little more interesting from the paladin's point of view.<br />
<br />
The model of &quot;I bring burst&quot; is not a good one for the game. You can counter stuns and bubbles and heals and even people running away from you. You can't counter someone unloading five digits of damage within just a few GCDs. That makes the combat shallow and frustrating. We're not convinced that is all Rets are about (because they do have heals, bubbles, cleansing and similar mechanics), but if we think the damage mechanics are too easy to counter, then we will compensate in other ways.<br />
<br />
This isn't anything you will see get hotfixed in next week. I am more trying to explain our thought process so that the Exorcism change makes a little more sense in context. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm just posting this because i don't think blizz knows what kind of crap they are getting themselves into...they've really dug themselves into a hole with the paladin<br />
<br />
i understand it's very hard to balance a class as long as you are gonna give it 2 things...high damage and decent healing(of course paladins do have the best damage reduction ability in the game too lol)...and i guess that's why there is so much commotion with paladins...<br />
<br />
and like most paladins know...besides judgement of justice(lol easily dispelable/purgable/trunket/freedom/cleansable or w/e you want to get out of it if you need to) is a rets only real pvp utility...against another player that is..i forget the name of the spell that reduces the other players stats...but that's dispelable too..you could kind of say that that is a paladin's version of a warriors ms...except a warriors ms is not dispellable and i think(vindication?) is....2 other plate wearing melee pvp classes have distance closers...warriors and dks...paladins do not...druid cat has a distance closer, and rogues do as well(something to look into...shamans may need a better move as well for pvp to help them out a bit)<br />

The blood elf rogue in the background is Valeera Sanguinar, she is part of Wrynn's entourage in the DC comics. Her eyes are green because she has been cursed by a warlock and she has also fel runes all over her body.<br />
<br />
And yes it makes no sense at all to have a blood elf rogue in the alliance (she is also in game somwhere though, I think in Stormwind). But the comics make no sense at all anyway.</div></div><hr />

We are preparing an in-game update that will be improving the rating system of the 3v3 and 5v5 brackets to allow all three of the brackets to have a similar number of players able to achieve ratings on par with what’s currently possible in our 2v2 arena bracket. As a result, we are changing the personal and team rating requirements for the item level 239 weapons from 2200 to 2350, but keep in mind the tooltip will continue to show the requirement as 2200 until patch 3.1.2.<br />
<br />
As a result of the above improvements, this change will prevent an excessive number of players from reaching much higher ratings and acquiring the highest grade of weapons in-game. The increase in rating requirements is designed to keep the number of players able to obtain these arena weapons on par with the number of players who are able to obtain the same grade of weapons from Heroic Ulduar.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the dumbest thing i have ever read in the 4 years ive played wow. It is WAY easier to obtain 2200 rating in 2v2 for some classes thats true, but its freaking HARD to get 2200 in 3v3, and now they make the rating req even harder. So its oke that 2v2 players that faceroll pala/dk to 2200, and even 2350 for some easy mode weapons, and 3v3 players have to become Gladiator rank in order to get those weapons. Blizzard, you just keep failing on this Arena system everytime they attempt to &quot;improve&quot; it.<br />
<br />
The weapons arent even that great to begin with. Tier 1 pvp weapons are the same if not worse then Deadly Gladiator weapons. Ulduar HC is just so easy, gues i get my weps from that place this season AGAIN.</div></div><hr />

wrong. pvp weapons are best ingame. <br />
same dps as heroic hardmode weapons but look at the speed. 3.6 instead of 3.4 = more max damage.</div></div><hr />

If they wanted to do that, they have to make different rating Req for all different Arena brackets 2v2, 3v3 and 5v5. Heres why:<br />
<br />
2v2 max ratings = 2350 - 2700 ~ 50 teams<br />
3v3 max ratings = 2350 - 2350 ~ 1 team<br />
5v5 max ratings = 2000 - 2000 ~ 0 teams<br />
<br />
With this change only a handfull of teams will be able to get T2 weapons with their 3v3, and absolutly NO teams will get it in 5v5. Ratings just dont go that high in 3v3 and 5v5.<br />
Instead of bringing it to &quot;par&quot; they exclude 3v3 and 5v5 to obtain those weapons and make them only available for 2v2 players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;I started with &quot;That's a fair point&quot; because the OP mentioned that paladins have more to contend with than just maximizing damage. They do have heals, bubbles, cleansing and similar mechanics going on. That is why I said we can't take something as complex as a rogue's combat system and shoehorn it in for Ret.<br />
<br />
But we can (and most likely will) change up the basic Seal, Judge, DS, CS, Exorcism buttons so that they can't all be brought to bear at once AND to make pushing those buttons a little more interesting from the paladin's point of view.<br />
<br />
The model of &quot;I bring burst&quot; is not a good one for the game. You can counter stuns and bubbles and heals and even people running away from you. You can't counter someone unloading five digits of damage within just a few GCDs. That makes the combat shallow and frustrating. We're not convinced that is all Rets are about (because they do have heals, bubbles, cleansing and similar mechanics), but if we think the damage mechanics are too easy to counter, then we will compensate in other ways.<br />
<br />
This isn't anything you will see get hotfixed in next week. I am more trying to explain our thought process so that the Exorcism change makes a little more sense in context. &quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
i'm just posting this because i don't think blizz knows what kind of crap they are getting themselves into...they've really dug themselves into a hole with the paladin<br />
<br />
i understand it's very hard to balance a class as long as you are gonna give it 2 things...high damage and decent healing(of course paladins do have the best damage reduction ability in the game too lol)...and i guess that's why there is so much commotion with paladins...<br />
<br />
and like most paladins know...besides judgement of justice(lol easily dispelable/purgable/trunket/freedom/cleansable or w/e you want to get out of it if you need to) is a rets only real pvp utility...against another player that is..i forget the name of the spell that reduces the other players stats...but that's dispelable too..you could kind of say that that is a paladin's version of a warriors ms...except a warriors ms is not dispellable and i think(vindication?) is....2 other plate wearing melee pvp classes have distance closers...warriors and dks...paladins do not...druid cat has a distance closer, and rogues do as well(something to look into...shamans may need a better move as well for pvp to help them out a bit)<br />
idk just a little rambling<br />
<br />
<br />
Weird that they think ret unloading damage &quot;shallow and frustrating&quot;, but don't feel the same way about mages and other classes/specs that did it (even worse) and still does today... (hi mages!).<br />
<br />
I guess it would actually boost paladins if they change them to move away from CD dependant damage toa more GCD/counters system. Wich would mean transforming Rets into Arms Warriors who can dishes a lot of damage without long CD dependance and countering other classes habilities (interrupts, etc...).<br />
<br />
If Rets weren't all about long CDs, they wouldn't need some sort of interrupt soo badly to fight spellcasters (mainly healers). As soon as you throw your cs/judge/ds, you're done and in the hands of your oponent (and you won't kill him with this &quot;burst dmg&quot;). Only noobs and bad luck players get cought on HoJ. At least long enough to be a certain death.</div></div><hr />

The absorb won't show up in WWS to the healer's meter. That means no epeen bonus for the legendary drooling healer. Also keep in mind it bones Disc priests (even with the shield glyph change).

Yup. Scrubs like you that were carried by being overpowered are 100% the reason for this change. You're not supposed to get the BiS gear if you could only get the rating when Arcane was overpowered as fuck, and so was Muti/Prep.<br />

The Alliance campaign in Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne was the Blood Elf campaign and details Kael'thas leaving the Alliance and joining up with Illidan. Given their history, I doubt all the blood elves are so thrilled about joining, or even allying with, the Horde - after all, the Horde did do a number on Quel'thalas during the Second War.</div></div><hr />

Hunter nerfs due to being OP in last seasons arena have gimped us in top end dps for raiding and blizzard sees nothing wrong with this. But no that hunters are underrepresented in the arena, we may be getting some changes. I wish they could separate the two worlds of PvE and PvP to provide a better balance for the classes in each situation.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Our dps isn't severely gimped in raiding, but it is inconsistent and sporadic now that LnL is a joke.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but you just noticed a trend that has been going on now since about the start of season 3?<br />
<br />
All I can say is, welcome to World of Arenanerfcraft. It's a fun game. Especially if yuo don't do arenas and your class gets thrown back and forth because of them all the time.</div></div><hr />

Yup. Scrubs like you that were carried by being overpowered are 100% the reason for this change. You're not supposed to get the BiS gear if you could only get the rating when Arcane was overpowered as fuck, and so was Muti/Prep.<br />

what? we stayed in the 2200's after nerf, and are 2200 now in season 6, we were also 2k+ in season 4...you dont know me or my partner, let alone anything about how our class's mechanics operate in the arena if you can just make blank statements like that...you obviously missed the entire point of my post...</div></div><hr />

#1: way to fail at quoting<br />
<br />
#2: you said you got duelist, that's what I made my statement based off of, not information that I don't know.<br />
<br />
Ok, 2200 in 2's, that was like 300 points below Glad on most battlegroups, not impressive at all. And the fact that you stayed there for the whole season while everyone else's ratings went up. Why do you deserve the best weapon in the game, again?<br />
<br />
Edit: also, no shit you're the same rating in S6 as you were in S5, so is everyone else. That's how the MMR system works, moron.</div></div><hr />

Go play TFT's Alliance campaign. Kael'thas' group of High Elves are the first to refer to themselves as Blood Elves (or sin'dorei), and at that point the only difference between a Blood Elf and a High Elf is that Blood Elves changed their name to honour their fallen kindred. Up until Kael'thas allied with Illidan, there was no difference between Kael's Blood Elves and the High Elves who continued to be quel'dorei. The current form of Blood Elves comes from that alliance, but there were still Blood Elves who served the Alliance, and there's a good bet that some of Blood Elves in general, though they've accepted the new source of power, don't agree with allying themselves with the Horde, especially since Kael'thas allied with demons (which they hate, by the way, almost as much as the Scourge) in Outland. The only reason they're really allied with the Horde is because a) the Alliance doesn't like that they use fel magic as an energy source and b) they share a common goal with the Forsaken.<br />
<br />
If that rogue was serving Variann before Kael'thas' emissary returned from Outland, there's good reason for her to be there. Being Blood Elf does not automatically ally them with the Horde in lore terms, just as being High Elf does not automatically ally them with the Alliance in lore terms (in fact, aside from a few units seen in WCIII, the High Elves are not part of the Alliance; they would, however, be biased against the Horde given the fact the Horde trashed Eversong and allied with the Amani trolls).</div></div><hr />

I meant that we stayed in the 2200's after the mage rogue nerfs, when a large majority of that comp either dropped like a rock in ratings, or disapeared altogether, we hung in there. But again this isnt about that, all I wanted to say is were far from scrubs, very far indeed, not top players but not scrubs and i took offense to that statement. The point however is that they change the rating required literally 2 weeks before we get our weapons, foiling our plans directly when were on the verge of making our goal. It feels like a nasty slap in the face, Im not going off into QQ land, I feel anyone that can hit 2200 can also get 2350 if they really focus and push for it, which is what were working on, and im sure alot of others are doing aswell. Still doesnt make the fact that the last 2 major goals in arena were very close to getting have been blocked directly considering where we stand at the time of the nerf. It seems quite foul on blizzards part and i usually agree with 99% of there changes.</div></div><hr />

I, myself, expressed the lower damage from my lava burst.<br />
How do you explain a lava burst going from 15k before 3.1.0 to 11k MAX now. I mean, come on. 100s of shamans are saying the same thing and still, you can't find a bug?<br />
<br />
&quot;Elemental Shaman<br />
As I posted in the other active thread on this topic, we still cannot find any bugs with Elemental. We looked at a lot of numbers from before and after 3.1 and (except for the lower crit values) the numbers don't seem very different. It could be that other classes, notably rogues and Feral druids, just improved.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Uh, it was a slap in the face to you personally? As if every single other person in the arena wasn't hurt the same amount?<br />
<br />
It's not like they gave anyone enough time to get the weapons, then decided &quot;ok guys, chrion and his partner are going to get their t2 weapons in 2 weeks, how can we stop this from happening?&quot;</div></div><hr />
