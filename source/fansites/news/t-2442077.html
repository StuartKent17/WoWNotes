Enjoyable if you are melee yeah played a Warlock recently? It's so fun getting raped by Rogues every five seconds, class design cannot get any worse than it is right now. It is the worst it has been in the history of the game, by a mile.</div></div><hr />

Well, I now have a cast time on Rebirth, and on my monk every freaking abilities is on CD every time I use them, so I have to wait like 5 seconds before I can start dpsing because touch of karma,touch of death, the clones, my trinket are all on the GCD..<br />

If some people didn't notice or remember, it's probably because they were not playing right.<br />

Yeah, they did. Off the top of my head: fire mage, enhancement shaman, elemental shaman, arms warrior, fury warrior, prot warrior and prot paladins. Hated every last one of them. ESPECIALLY enhancement. They took ALL the fun out of that spec, and it hasn't come back since.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only melee DPS classes whose gameplay doesn't feel like an Atari 2600 are Demon Hunters and Rogues. The rest were trashed by the GCD changes. (That guy who posted about Windwalker needing 5 seconds before they can DPS? Yeah, he's right...Windwalker was my main last expansion, and yes, that is the new &quot;rotation&quot;, if you can call it that. I can't even log mine in.)<br />
<br />
Some ranged specs are slightly better, but the more power-ups and self-buffs your spec requires, the more clunky and useless it feels. (Don't get me started on Elemental having 6s shock cooldowns with a reason of &quot;because fuck you that's why&quot;. If any spec shows the class design team are rank amateurs, that's it.)<br />
<br />
Not that Holinka is going to fix anything, though. He mostly just shitted all over PVP so that the specs he liked always won.</div></div><hr />

Funny, cause tanks were OP as fuck in WoD in both instanced and wpvp, and in Legion they were god mode in wpvp, despite being crap in instanced pvp.<br />
Meanwhile in BFA, tanks are epic shit in both instanced pvp and wpvp.<br />

Ashran was fun for winning team. Once team got competent leader, other team had 0 chance of recovery even if they get competent leader because after losing few events most people just give up. Endless battleground was a bad idea. It was shit show for alliance.</div></div><hr />

The loot system for pvp in WoD was actually quite nice. We gave him a lot or shit in the day, but looking back he worked well with what he was given.<br />

FWIW most of the pvp community sees this as a VERY positive addition to the team.</div></div><hr />

You're telling me you want to get rid of bloodtalons which actually interacts with your rotation and adds a layer to decision making, but make boring ass savage roar that literally is a use and forget buff baseline? I'm glad you're not on the class design team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I agree with you on Bloodtalons, the part about Savage Roar is so wrong. Savage Roar is as much as &quot;use and forget&quot; as rip &quot;use and forget&quot;. It's a part of a core rotation since forever.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean you're glad I'm not on the design team that, up until this point, has put us where we are, currently, at the bottom of every ranking chart, with the most difficult melee rotation in the game for the least amount of reward for doing it perfectly? That design team?<br />
<br />
The same design team you don't want me to be a part of that has basically condemned an entire class spec to being turned down in mythic+ runs with PUGS due to their sloppy and overly complicated rotation and piss poor AOE compared to every other melee class?<br />
<br />
The same design team you don't want me to be a part of, that has ignored literally years of suggestions from the Feral druid community and just added tiny patches here and there that still maintains the status quo while solving none of the problems we have complained about for so long?<br />
<br />
That design team?<br />
<br />
The design team that had massive feedback for MONTHS about our state in BfA back in Friends and Family Alpha and literally did absolutely nothing until 2 weeks after retail release, and even then just buffed energy regen a tiny bit with a pitiful 4% dps increase? That design team?<br />
<br />
The same design team that gave us a gigantic buff to Haste and made it our most important stat that literally up until that point NO Feral cat had geared for, at all, ever, and then after doing that, reduced its effectiveness by 25% after we all geared for haste? That design team?<br />
<br />
The same design team who are now making Savage Roar even more important in 8.1 by buffing our energy regen while it is in effect, the same ability you JUST downplayed in your comment? That same design team?<br />
<br />
The same design team who is now making Mastery affect our finishing moves, something that has been suggested for years, and now it's going to be on equal footing with haste and crit, so now we have to shift our gearing stats yet AGAIN..? That design team?<br />
<br />

Savage Roar is as much as &quot;use and forget&quot; as rip &quot;use and forget&quot;. It's a part of a core rotation since forever.<br />
<br />
You're kidding me right? Rip interacts with TF and BT. The difference between a shit feral and a good feral will know when to pandemic a rip and over-ride a pre existing rip with new damage modifiers. This isn't so relevant at the moment with Sabertooth being the most popular talent, but my point still stands. Savage roar is garbage and needs to go away, more so than Slice and Dice has.<br />

<br />
You mean you're glad I'm not on the design team that, up until this point, has put us where we are, currently, at the bottom of every ranking chart, with the most difficult melee rotation in the game for the least amount of reward for doing it perfectly? That design team?<br />
<br />
The same design team you don't want me to be a part of that has basically condemned an entire class spec to being turned down in mythic+ runs with PUGS due to their sloppy and overly complicated rotation and piss poor AOE compared to every other melee class?<br />
<br />
The same design team you don't want me to be a part of, that has ignored literally years of suggestions from the Feral druid community and just added tiny patches here and there that still maintains the status quo while solving none of the problems we have complained about for so long?<br />
<br />
That design team?<br />
<br />
The design team that had massive feedback for MONTHS about our state in BfA back in Friends and Family Alpha and literally did absolutely nothing until 2 weeks after retail release, and even then just buffed energy regen a tiny bit with a pitiful 4% dps increase? That design team?<br />
<br />
The same design team that gave us a gigantic buff to Haste and made it our most important stat that literally up until that point NO Feral cat had geared for, at all, ever, and then after doing that, reduced its effectiveness by 25% after we all geared for haste? That design team?<br />
<br />
The same design team who are now making Savage Roar even more important in 8.1 by buffing our energy regen while it is in effect, the same ability you JUST downplayed in your comment? That same design team?<br />
<br />
The same design team who is now making Mastery affect our finishing moves, something that has been suggested for years, and now it's going to be on equal footing with haste and crit, so now we have to shift our gearing stats yet AGAIN..? That design team?<br />
<br />
Yea I'm glad I'm not to blame for that shit, too. So thank's for the unintended, snarky compliment :)<br />
<br />
Yikes mate. Way to jump the gun and assume that I have no issue with how Feral actually plays at the moment. Please don't lecture me on the spec, I'm far from new playing Feral and fully aware of the flaws it has. And making Savage Roar baseline will not fix any issues you seem to think I don't know about, go away.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, when Warlocks did not get raped by Rogues? I main a Rogue since WotLK and i've always found Warlocks to be one of the easiest classes to kill.

The problem back then was that ability pruning (which lowered the skill cap and made them all feel like dog shit after MoP), in hindsight, was clearly the fault of Ion Hazzicostas, not Holinka (judging from the addition of PVP talents, and their subsequent pruning after he left).<br />
As such, if Brack causes Ion to finally leave to &quot;pursue other opportunities&quot; (dear God, please let this happen - and soon. WoW can't take much more of Ion. I will instant resub if he goes), then it's possible it might not end up terribly.<br />

Ok you’re saying “as it should be” as if it solves the problem as opposed to getting rid of it. I can agree on the talent thought, but while we’re at it let’s address how boring blood scent is, soul of the forest to an extent, and sabertooth. <br />
<br />
I gave my argument behind how blood talons is the least of Feral’s concerns atm, especially comparing how the two affect gameplay and decision making. <br />
<br />
Since you’re just resulting to passive aggressiveness and ignoring my points, I’ll just leave you to normal pugging because I’m clearly wasting my time here.</div></div><hr />

Arguably it took a lot of work to make Ashran less sucky. Ashran was only tolerable a.) with the right addons and b.) after they interrated over it a few times.<br />
<br />
Most people don't PvP much so when they jumped into Ashran early -- it was, indeed, a terrible experiece.<br />

Valid observation nevertheless, but he was quite the asshole and is/was responsible for many dumbass decisions prior to WOD in the first place. Personally, my opinion of the guy is that he is a huge douchebag and was promoted according to the Peter Principle, and held that position for entirely too long. I'm not that stoked to see him back on the WoW team in ANY capacity.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm willing to reserve judgement (for now) and see what comes forth. Maybe that tardmuffin actually learned something in his time away. Otherwise, yes, he will be blamed for EVERYTHING wrong with BFA, and I have have to wonder if he wasn't brought back on the team specifically to be the scapegoat this time around.<br />
<br />
Were I in Holinka's shoes, I wouldn't have accepted the move back to the WoW team for that exact reason, but who knows, maybe he's close enough to retirement that it really doesn't matter to him.<br />
<br />
As somebody else mentioned, it would be cool to see actual PvP warfronts. That's kinda what I thought those were supposed to be. A sort of a &quot;Ashran Done Right (TM)&quot; if you will. If Holinka makes that happen at all, I'll think the better of him to some small degree.<br />
<br />
I guess we'll see. I'm generally happy with BFA thus far (and I am a effin' shadowpriest, mind you), but I said the same thing early on in WOD, and that was a goddamned abortion. Hopefully they get it right this time.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that a bit premature to say? We aren't even one major patch in. And selfie camera 6.1 content patch will be very hard to beat as a lowest point. The Azerite system was a miss, but they show intent to improve on it. Silly to scratch the expansion off just yet.<br />

Not to look for a scapegoat, but that guy should never touch anything in WoW. Go make cards for Hearthstone and just never have any influence on class design.<br />

Never say that - it can always get worse.<br />
Fixing the worst expansion of all time, by bringing in &quot;talent&quot; responsible for the second worst expansion of all time and giving him another crack at the title is not encouraging.

while it isn't as bad as MoP at launch, ppl like to forget/ignore how unplayable was MoP at start, MoP is - so far - only example i can name of horrible expansion start, that got better with time<br />
I don't blame ppl for hating bfa - it deserves it - and right now it is even worse than MoP start, but still why assume it will go WoD way instead of MoP ? WoD start was good (if ppl forgot that), the problem was how blizz ignored it later, with the biggest joke the selfie patch with a raid that was tested in beta</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember at the start of WoD not being able to quest in Frostfire because the item you needed to click to construct your garrison (and which was tied to opening all the quests in the zone) was broken for hours... and having to grind mobs to 92 in order to move onto the next zone for quests. That's my definition of a bad start, as well as the BRF raid being released so soon after Highmaul where hardly anyone cleared Highmaul on mythic before the next raid came out. As I recall, MoP start was fine for me, even beyond the initial days. Perhaps we have differing definitions of a bad start?<br />

<br />
From the complaints on forums, those centered on the pruning from MoP to WoD. They eliminated a lot skilled counterplay, and people complained that PVP became a lot more of DPS race with he-who-has-more-cooldowns-wins. In addition, there were the usual under/over performing classes that were not fixed for months on end, as well as the only new PVP content being Ashran which, at the start, was not received very well for a bunch of reasons.<br />
<br />
Some of the criticisms of him were undoubtedly justified, others may not have been (the pruning for example, I would guess came from Ion's orders).</div></div><hr />

the bugged launch happened in every exp except Legion, so WoD had bugged launch is the normal, legion was first (and so far, only) to break that cycle<br />
MoP i'm sure no one was able to do anything for first 2 weeks except farm reputation non stop with stupid dailies to be able to do anything, that what was wrong with MoP, it is so bad that is literally only expansion my rl friend recommended to me to NOT play at start at least and wait for things to get better, something he didn't say about any exp including BFA</div></div><hr />

It's funny here on MMO-C everyone is criticizing him. You go to his Twitter post and WoWhead post and people are glad he's coming back. Several are even asking for Ashran back (except call it Splashran for after 8.1)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shoegazing</div><div class="date">2018-10-22, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The number of dumb comments in this thread is astounding, and shows that the majority of people in this community have zero comprehension:<br />
<br />
1. How software development works generally<br />
2. What anyone's specific role within Blizzard is<br />
<br />
To correct some misonsceptions:<br />
<br />
1. Holinka was never a class designer before, he was the lead PvP systems designer (battlegrounds, arena, yes ashran lol, PvP gearing/conquest system, rewards, etc)<br />
2. Now Holinka has authority over all combat which includes not only PvP but also the mechanics of classes<br />
3. I dislike Celestalon a lot, but it is wrong to say that he was the head class designer. He was just another member of the team, except for the fact that he was more willing to put himself out there in front of the community while all the other designers refuse to show their faces.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you to better contextualize what this new development means for the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What i find weird is, knowing how sensitive players are about the game state right now, is bringing back someone who was really hated and blamed (rightfuly or not, that's not the point here) for bad decisions and announcing it like that good ideas?<br />
<br />
Agree or not, as of lately they are taking some really awkward decisions. Some even feel trollish. <br />
<br />
Anyway, i'll wait and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just do your research man. As if peoples' reactions in this thread aren't enough, Holinka was not a good thing when he first was part of the team. Most of my feelings are personal, so things like adding lootboxes to PvP instead of a currency-based system, to me, were things that really hurt PvP.<br />
<br />
I don't believe many people have a positive view of him. But if you really want to know, do your homework.<br />
<br />
Ashran was painted as this glorious place for PvPers to enjoy. It would have everything centric to PvP known to the game all in one place, and people would love it. Except, it was extremely boring and didn't deliver on any of the points it seemed to promise. Such was Holinka's legacy.</div></div><hr />

Because in every thread you ask for explanations like a newborn who can't find information on its own. It's my opinion he did a lot of damage to PvP, I presented that opinion in the same post you just quoted.<br />
<br />
I'm telling you to do your research to come to your own conclusion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the &quot;new&quot; devs at Blizzard have to be pure retards... how the hell can you even think about &quot;all are equal&quot; and &quot;freeloot for all&quot; feels good? Its pure disapointment... its not fun... and the worst thing: YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORK FOR. You have no target to chase... and then beeing surprised because sub-numbers droping hard. Well... you deserve nothing more if your &quot;brightest&quot; devs are proud to remove the core of WoW (which is the same as in other mmorpg´s). What happens when you remove the heart from a human? Right...</div></div><hr />

I wanna hear arguments from you. I know what Ashran was like. I played in WoD. I don't need to do research. I wanna hear from you why you think he almost killed PvP. If you give another non-answer I'm gonna assume you have no argument.</div></div><hr />

MoP i'm sure no one was able to do anything for first 2 weeks except farm reputation non stop with stupid dailies to be able to do anything, that what was wrong with MoP, it is so bad that is literally only expansion my rl friend recommended to me to NOT play at start at least and wait for things to get better, something he didn't say about any exp including BFA<br />
<br />
WoD was the only expansion with full on completely horrible, horrible launch sequence as far as I recall. MoP was smoother then WoD's was for sure, for a large amount of people. So that's odd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't have an argument. Never claimed to have one because frankly I'm not arguing with anyone. I have an opinion, though. And that opinion is that Holinka damaged the PvP system in a way that caused a drastic drop-off of participation. He can be tied to the removal of PvP vendors, the removal of specific PVP gear (a la resilience), loot-box system from PvP instead, templates, the removal of 5v5, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you've had too much internet for one day. Not every discussion is an argument, and people are perfectly fine having an opinion based solely on the way something made them feel. Now kindly fuck off.</div></div><hr />

You weren't around for Wrath's launch, then, or TBCs. <br />
<br />
TBC was waiting in line to get past the authentication servers. <br />
<br />
Wrath was just an unstable mess. I dimly recall some rollbacks during that launch, but I could be wrong. <br />
<br />
WoD's was bad, I remember not being able to zone out of my garrison, things like that. <br />
<br />
Most of the problems for launch is the servers gets slammed. By the time they'd gotten to MoP, they'd identified the problems and upgraded/redesigned the authentication servers, among other things, and there was a major server hardware overhaul I believe as part of Cata. Wrath's two starting zones was done to avoid the bottlenecks and server slam in Hellfire in TBC's launch. WoD's launch issues was mostly the tech behind garrisons, which was new. (And, was probably melting down from a massive spike in population trying to use it very quickly)</div></div><hr />

Considering I started playing August 5th 2010 in late wrath no I haven't been around for them. I was mainly stating that Mops launch was not bad whatsoever compared to WoDs. I can only imagine how terrible the BC one was though or Wraths. WoD was also bad because of lizard squad or whoever that group was that was DDosing. I remember waiting in like 3000 to 5000 In queue to log in for the first couple weeks and even near the new year (2015). Was so bad lol.</div></div><hr />
