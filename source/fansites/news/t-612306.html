Gamona.de (http://www.gamona.de/) had the chance to interview J. Allen Brack (Production Director) and Tom Chilton (aka. Kalgan, Lead Game Designer) and ask a few questions about Wrath of the Lich King. The most interesting parts of the interview are :<br />
Premades characters level 80 will be made available near the end of the beta testing process. Whether it will be done on a new server or on the existing beta servers isn't decided yet. <br />
The next beta build will most likely feature new level 80 dungeons and remove the level cap. <br />
In the current state of WotLK beta testing, the retribution paladin is doing a lot more damage than expected and will most likely be nerfed. <br />
Naxxramas mechanics changes to suit 25 players raid include a new version of the Four Horsemen allowing non-tanking classes to tank some of the bosses. <br />

<br />
How is the beta going ? Is everything alright ? <br />
T.C. - Things are definitely going very well, we've got a lot of very good feedbacks through the beta process. We've been making a lot of changes and improvements based on the feedback but overall it's coming along very well.<br />
<br />
The beta servers have been very unstable in the last days, is there any improvement ?<br />
J.A.B - We've got our server team who is looking into all problems, the point of our beta process is to actually figure out what problems we have and get them all fixed before we do the big release. <br />
<br />
Is there any plan to open more beta realms ?<br />
T.C. - We do actually have plans to start up a realm that has premade characters at level 80, the reason being that we're going to want to give players another opportunity to test some of the end game content without having to go through the leveling process. We can probably do that near the end of the beta process but it might be on a different server, this isn't decided for sure.<br />
<br />
When do you plan to open more instances and rise the level cap to level 80 ?<br />
T.C. - Each time we do another patch on the beta we try to open up new content for the players. [...] I don't know if we'll be able to patch this week while we're being here in Europe but that should be coming very soon.<br />
J.A.B - For each patch we try to evaluate how much content do we have, is it time to give players the chance to open that up ? We're talking internally about when it is time to rise us up to level 80 but we're getting close.<br />
<br />
Why didn't you separate PvE from PvP more?<br />
T.C. - We made that decision because prior to The Burning Crusade, what we found as people increase their gear they die quicker because PvE gear is specialized gear. For DPS classes as an example it is designed to do the most damage as possible in the shortest time as possible and it does not have a lot of survivability. If that's the best gear players have available, then what happens is they take that into PvP is that they die very quickly and there's not much time for their strategies to evolve. What we've found is that in PvP we had to create gear with balanced offensive capability and survivability and because of that we had to create this separate set of gear with the new stat called resilience to make sure fights lasted long enough so that they are interesting and have depth. [...] Well, certainly something that we want to do for Litch king is better crossover so that when you're doing PvE you are actually able to accumulate some PvP gear in case you decide to try out some PvP you'll have a good <br />
starting point. The same would go in reverse, if you're doing a lot of PvP, you might have a couple of really good items that you could use into PvE and do pretty well.<br />
<br />
What about the paladin, is there any plans to nerf the DPS Paladin's damage from what it is on beta servers now?<br />
T.C. - We are just now beginning on going through the heavy tuning phase, we really don't do that until the end of the beta generally, where we start going through all of the classes and finding the things that are way out of balance and there's no doubt right now that the ret paladins are doing a lot more damage than what we would expect. <br />
<br />
Are you satisfied with how the death knight is going?<br />
T.C. - Yeah, the death knight has been coming along very well, we've been getting a lot of good feedback from it, people seem to like the class, they seem to enjoy the starting experience very much, we really kind of put our heart into the death knight class, hopefully that's going to pan out.<br />
<br />
What talent tree do you prefer on the death knights?<br />
T.C. - Personally, I really enjoy the frost talents, but I believe all three trees are very strong, they all definitely all have a strong role to play.<br />
<br />
What else do you plan? Are there any more instances coming?<br />
T.C. - Well, certainly, there are a lot more instances we plan to release, CoT: Strath instance, Ulduar, a handful that we are play testing internally that are pretty much ready for players to see, should be one of the patches that come out any time now [...] but it should be rolling out there very quickly.<br />
<br />
All the instances were very well designed, however, I consider it unfortunate that say, Azjol-Nerub only has three bosses, its very short.<br />
T.C. - Most players would consider that a fortunate thing, we've been getting a lot of feedback in the past that some of the instances were taking too long, so we're going for the middle ground here, we want to have some diversity between the instances too, there are a lot of players that miss the old big dungeon crawls, like BRD, etc. We want to find ways to deliver that too, but ultimately I think the core experience is that players should be able to get through an instance in less than an hour. Its something that we're trying to be very conscious about in Wrath, unlike in Burning Crusade when we had the heroic instances, those take a very long time to get through, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours depending on your quality of gear. We're trying to make sure when Litch King comes out that when you do the heroic instances, it doesn't take as much time going through it as you did before. <br />
<br />
But, we need the epic feeling from the Blackrock Depths too.<br />
T.C. - We're trying to capture that too as much as possible.<br />
<br />
How do you plan to balance the 10 and 25 man raid instances? Are there any changes in boss design?<br />
T.C. - There definitely are changes in boss design, for example, not only do we have to have changes in boss design even to get it down to 25 from the way Naxx used to work, certainly in the past at level 60, the four horseman boss took eight different tanks for instance. There definitely has been design change, but the integrity of the encounter remains the same, you still have the four horsemen, they all are still there. The mechanics of the fight are different, you will tank them in different ways, the horsemen will be tanked by different classes, even non tanking classes, kinda like what we have done in the past with warlocks tanking. We have some mechanics like that in place so that we can maintain the integrity of the encounters even though the actual mechanics will be different. <br />
<br />
Will Naxx still be one instance?<br />
T.C. - It is still a single instance, it still has that epic feel.<br />
<br />
When will Wrath be released?<br />
T.C. - When its ready. Specifically, the fifth of when it's ready.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I'm a raider and i think i can answer for most of us that the reason why we like longer raids is...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
<br />
BETTER CONTENT! If its longer it means theres better gear, its more fun, you get to know your raid memebers more and its, again, better content. Take BT and SWP for example: they have great gear and their fun because there long. I dont want heroics to lasts hours though, but raids yes. Because raids are meant to be done with a guild and friends and harder to pug harder content but heroics are easier to pug and should be short. Thats what i at least think</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ninthelora</div><div class="date">2008-08-20, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well.. long instances just gives more an epic feeling. But it shouldnt be farm instances for badges. It should be very hard with superior gear.<br />
I even wished there were more timed instances like ZA. So AFK'ers can quit the game cause no1 want them in the group.<br />
<br />
What about items from last boss with stats depending on the time it took to kill him?<br />
<br />
Like a rogue chest with 40 agility min if it take more then average time(1hour?). And every minute faster gives +1 agi. So if you kill it in 56 minutes it should give 44 agility.<br />
<br />
Although while writing this, im thinkin of slackers that makes it hard to get for the non slackers.</div></div><hr />

OK, sure. I can see nerfing Art of War to take care of the 20k JoComm crits on stunned targets, but they already did that. Why lower our DPS more, is it that great?

It honestly wouldn't surprise me actually. When I went down to preorder my copy of WotLK's collector's edition at the local EB (er, &quot;Gamestop&quot; now I guess...), their computers had it slated for November 4th. And while they obviously don't have some magic connection with the game developers to get inside scoops on release dates, hearing the &quot;fifth of when it's done&quot; line puts a bit more emphasis on the fact that they could have gotten it correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
this.I don't walk into instances for the loot(not only, of course), i walk in there for the visuals, for the story, for the encounters and so on.<br />
If it's just &quot;random generic dungeon 3.2&quot; with no involvement of the story, no depth, because you walk in and kill a mob and walk out, it sucks.<br />
<br />
I think best would be to make it, well, the way some instances already work: you CAN spend a lot of time in them, say 3-5 hours if you do everything, but it's not needed. like, it's in parts/wings so you can search a group for a specific wing, a further questline/progress, or do the whole thing. That way, you have the epic feeling, what with a giant instance thing and many ways to go, but it's not necessary. BRD was like that, i spent 3-5 hours in there, but sometimes, we just went in and did the onyxia q-line, or the golem-guy; if we didn't wipe like shit from time to time, or gank/get the shit ganked out of us, it wouldn't have taken us more than an hour.</div></div><hr />

Honestly it's because hardcore raiders have nothing else to do with there time. Most of the players do have things going on outside of WoW, so they prefer shorter raids/ instances. I get the feeling from a lot of hardcore raiders that all they care is that they get the gear, even if it means downing 20 bosses in a ten hour raid. They prefer quantity over quality.<br />
<br />
I can't stand raiding anymore, I have a T6 resto shaman. It use to be fun but once you do a 3-5 hour raid 20+ time you get sick of it. To the point where you hear it over vent and you say you might D/C do to power because there is a lightning storm outside.<br />
<br />
My warrior is all pvp, and I love it a hell of a lot more. Unlike raiding it is always changing (not the area but the players and competition). Truthfully pvping is a lot harder than BT or sunwell once you hit the 2000+ arena rating area.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mhm, you'll grow to hate the tiny bold man like the rest of us do.<br />
<br />
One note though, I DO like shorter instances. 3-4 hour runs, heroic or non are kinda pushing it unless you are in a Raid which of course will take longer. But for us students who &quot;study hard&quot; and therefore don't have oodles of time left over what with other important activities ($%&amp;ing off, downloading $%&amp;, sending that youtube vid to your mate, etc) having a short, fun, and otherwise memorable gaming session is much desired. And before you clatter on about &quot;bollocks to you casual ba$&amp;$@&quot;, the monthly fees I have paid to this game add up to a roll of gold toilet paper by this point. So yes, buff druids nerf warlocks/rogues/hunters give me instant loot with an epic travel land for and a cold beer.<br />

Well ok that they are doing too much Damage especially the Judgement is true but &quot;a lot more damage than what we would expect&quot; is a far too dramatic in my opinion...<br />

Hah, right. 'PvP' in Warcraft is a disguised 'scripted event', and requires the same 'tactical insight' as 'scripted encounters', and all of you know it. Stop kidding yourselves.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh, a Warrior. CC it.&quot; &quot;Oh, a healer, mana-burn it.&quot;<br />
<br />
And can we please stop calling 'PvP' in Warcraft 'PvP' ? Sure, it's still a player vs a player, but they degraded everything it could have been in the wonderful world of Massively Multiplayer gaming to be nothing else but a co-op, Halo/shooter kind of ordeal. Shove two groups in a cubicle and shower them in epics to keep them happy. Where are my epic army vs. army battles ? Where went my feeling we were actually two factions at a tenacious peace and conflict is looming around every corner ?<br />
<br />
Arenas might be fine but they made them to damn rewarding, and completely forgot about the other 'love child' in the misbegotten marriage called 'PvP in Warcraft', namely, battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
If I wanted to 'frag' people, I wouldn't be playing World of Warcraft, and so shouldn't you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not necessarily a minus in PvE, resilience can be nice to make up for lack of defense - though druids won't need it anymore and plate tanks will have lots of defense gear, so...<br />
Anyway, either don't let the Season gear have the same itemLevel as the current progression Raid gear, or increase the iValue of resilience, so that PvP gear eats up much of those points before they can be spent for damage stats.</div></div><hr />

We actually got better group healing ability which was what we needed. Beacon of Light, Light and wisdom judgements which scale (earlier versions of those judgements are just a joke). I like what they've done with the paladin healing.<br />

It wasn't a surprise to me actually 4 years now the only thing i see is warlock/rogues/game developers whining about the paladin dps/healing.<br />
I don't want my bok in prot i want it back in retri.<br />
I don't want pvp talents in retri i want pure pve.<br />
I don't want judgement resists or seal of command misses.<br />
I don't want dispelable divine shield and spell stealable wings.<br />
I don't want another healing spell 3 are far too many for a crit to heal class.....<br />
Honestly the next thing i am waiting to see is a massive nerf on all wotlk two hand weapons except polearms(hunters....) just because all warriors will be dual wielding two hands and WOW paladin wield a single two hand !!! What a coincidence!! Do not expect weapons with strenght anymore paladins got buff in strenght only ap and haste for hunters and warriors :D.<br />
When we get back what was primarily ours we are going to be equal to the noob classes who lose in pve even with the noob paladin retri talents.<br />
Btw i noticed that there is no bos in wotlk so i guess one less paladin spot on all raids :P merry christmas in epl fellow dks !!!</div></div><hr />

Then BLz change CS and vengeance(back to 15% anyway) back agian. I have seen some many times that BLZ do something which gonna slap themselves..../sigh...<br />

judgement dmg is too much imo....considering at 80 ppl may have around 16~18k Hp...maybe 6000crit JOC is a bit high,but ret pala need something to put pressure on his target. otherwise it is just&quot;there is just a ret pala on me so don't worry about it&quot; abouthowever with the nerf of judement dmg...maybe ret pala will say bye bye to blue rage bar system (judgement of wise).....BLZ really have to think about this...share items with Dk and warr means ret paladin's mana is pretty low...&gt;.&lt;!</div></div><hr />

Being in a guild that is trying brutallus, we rarely go with less than 5 paladins in raid, often more. Paladins are awesome tank healers, retri ones, besides their utilities are no less than 5th or so on the dps chart. For comparison, the most we can take in raid are 2 rogues in total, making 3 in the whole guild (1 for backup). So imo, l2p then whine about buffs :p</div></div><hr />

Well, dps drop is awesome, not half but from 1800 to 1200-1300. Same with the warrior if taken out of mele group and the godly WF. Actually meles are only doing good dps in perfect conditions with full buffs, remove some and you get something to laugh upon. This is very true for retris too - great dps and great utility inside mele group, laughable dps and still great utility outside, see no problem?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2008-08-21, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why does it seem so many raiders think along the lines of longer and more painstaking is better? Its like with gearing. Raiders hate on welfare epics because they aren't as painstaking to acquire as raid gear. But even with this interview you get the sense from the interviewer that he's a raider, and would prefer the 3, 4, 5 hour long dungeon crawls. <br />
<br />
Honestly why do so many raiders tend to think along these painstaking lines of gameplay? Why can't something be 1 hour, or even 1/2 hour? Why can't there be 20 of them broken up into smaller time segments instead of a 2, 3, etc. hour straight just to get through it? I don't get it. <br />
<br />
Is the accomplishment just how much time you've sunk into something period? ???<br />
<br />
It's more an issue of how easy PvP epics are to get - you don't need to win/kill anything to get them. You can lose all 10 arena matches or battlegrounds and you'll still be rewarded. And yet they're still good for PvE (at least for DPS). As such, there's hardly any actual &quot;accomplishment&quot; there, other than a high arena rating.<br />
<br />
As for the dungeon length, it's clear they're becoming very fast to clear. Take MGT for example, it's a quick 20 - 30 minute run with a good group. And the trash pulls there are REALLY big. Odds are good that some of the new instances will be even faster, as they'll have less trash per pull, but keep the same number of bosses. I'm not sure what they meant by having feedback about instances being too long... the only long instances in TBC were Kara and BT.<br />
<br />
If anything TBC instances were too SHORT, Magtheridon in particular should've had at least 3 or 4 other bosses in there, the first one on a par with Attumen in Kara. Same goes for Gruul. <br />
<br />
The good news is that we get Naxx this time, which they'll hopefully be able to scale properly. I'm hoping for a Gruul - level Patchwerk or so.</div></div><hr />

A. Shut up<br />

C. Accept info from people who are in beta.<br />

Atm in Pve, paladins are fine and many are brough to high raids, on the contrary for for instance druids where we (A 4/6 SW guild) usually bring only one while we take many more paladins and shams and coh priests.<br />
Pve healing paladins have been buffed very much in WOTLK Beta atm, having an aoe heal and massive mana efficientie aswell as very strong Seals which can be judged from far away and last very long.<br />
Tom Chilton however was talking about ret damage in the BETA, which is really over the top atm, I (Feral druid in bear with 5/5 vengefull and 60% Armor migitation in bear) Have been brough down from 21k health to 5k health while in bear in the duration of 1 HOJ from a retri paladin in WOTLK quest greens, critting me several times for 4k+ in the duration.<br />
I hope everyone can agree this is over the top, especially against clothies with 0 resi who are getting one-shotted atm.<br />
I think this is all an itemisation BUG and should be fixed, not a nerf as to what ret is now</div></div><hr />

This is really crap mate, Good arena pvp at 1800+ rating requires more skill then raiding BT and I even see sunwell geared mages fail at something as easy as controlling rogues.<br />
In my guild we have a prot warrior who never tanked illidan flames before who is in a 3v3 team with 2300 rating, he tanked them without any effort while regulars still fail at dodging flames and stuff.<br />
PvP&gt;Pve in personall skill<br />
PvP=Pve in communication and coordination (if you are a raidleader or officer as a normal member you just do what your told)<br />
PvP&lt;Pve in dedication.<br />
<br />
Also a common mistake is that ''losing 10 games a week'' gets you easy epics, this is as far as i can see untrue, say you are at 1500 rating all time, this gets you 300 points a week for 10 games so say around 1.5 hour/week play.<br />
That way it takes 1 month to get your first Item (gloves) and then you still have 1 Piece of BT pve gear in 1 month, you can't tell me you can't get 1 epic/month in pve unless you seriously fail.<br />
Heck i got 6/8 tier 6 and bt equiv gear in a span of 3 weeks while being in bt+sw, so all-in-all pve gives faster gear then pvp.<br />
<br />
Also Farming honor gear takes a total over ~300000 honor and 250 marks to get the full s2 set+Guardian gear (assuming you have the pr for it) being able to farm 2.5k honor/hour is fast so for a full set you would spend 120 hours in av to get a full pvp set which is about tk equivalent in pve dps, I have been like 100 hours in pve and i already have far better gear.<br />
<br />
This is all i have to say about it, ask me questions or flame if you don't like the truth, i will try to answer all</div></div><hr />

Heck i got 6/8 tier 6 and bt equiv gear in a span of 3 weeks while being in bt+sw, so all-in-all pve gives faster gear then pvp.<br />
<br />
Also Farming honor gear takes a total over ~300000 honor and 250 marks to get the full s2 set+Guardian gear (assuming you have the pr for it) being able to farm 2.5k honor/hour is fast so for a full set you would spend 120 hours in av to get a full pvp set which is about tk equivalent in pve dps, I have been like 100 hours in pve and i already have far better gear.<br />
<br />
This is all i have to say about it, ask me questions or flame if you don't like the truth, i will try to answer all<br />

a very good post.<br />
but: you only get your 6 T6 pieces if you already farm BT and sunwell ;)<br />
otherwise its a more painful way..</div></div><hr />

Tier 6 you get like crazy, 3 pieces per slot per run, so yeh you can get full tier 6 in weeks. Other gear... less so. I'm still waiting for my Skull of Gul'dan, and we've yet to see an off-hand warglaive drop. This is &quot;random loot is random&quot;, which it is NOT in PvP.</div></div><hr />

A. Shut up<br />
B. Play Beta<br />
C. Accept info from people who are in beta.<br />
<br />
Atm in Pve, paladins are fine and many are brough to high raids, on the contrary for for instance druids where we (A 4/6 SW guild) usually bring only one while we take many more paladins and shams and coh priests.<br />
Pve healing paladins have been buffed very much in WOTLK Beta atm, having an aoe heal and massive mana efficientie aswell as very strong Seals which can be judged from far away and last very long.<br />
Tom Chilton however was talking about ret damage in the BETA, which is really over the top atm, I (Feral druid in bear with 5/5 vengefull and 60% Armor migitation in bear) Have been brough down from 21k health to 5k health while in bear in the duration of 1 HOJ from a retri paladin in WOTLK quest greens, critting me several times for 4k+ in the duration.<br />
I hope everyone can agree this is over the top, especially against clothies with 0 resi who are getting one-shotted atm.<br />
I think this is all an itemisation BUG and should be fixed, not a nerf as to what ret is now<br />
<br />
<br />
1- Clothies with 0 that think they can own everyone and not get owned by a heavy hitter melee class is a noob, this situation happens today in TBC, it's not WotLK exclusive;<br />
2- Today in live, a clothie with 0 resi that isn't a fresh new 70, can one shot everyone in PvP, specially melees that do not get in melee range very fast (lol ret pally). They need to be killed on sight (go go locks doing 9k+ shadowbolts on 400+ resi ppl), they'll die fast, but if they're not stupid or had a bad luck, they'll take 1 or 2 with them before it;<br />
3- As long as you see that a ret pally will not spell lock you, stun lock you, &quot;interrupt&quot; everytime (more than a emergency long cd resistible stun/repentance, that you can trinket/bubble out without any spell cast real interrupt), charge/intercept (this means, get in melee range all the time) you'll have to aggree that they're left alone with just pure (and partially mitigated) damage. If they can't do enough damage to counter their lack of combat control (like you example druid HAVE and will still have in wotlk), they're just a epic fail at pvp.<br />
<br />
It's nice that ppl talk about ret paladins performance in high end raids (BT/SWP), but forget what they need to get there. A Ret paladin is as good as his gear is (more than dps warriors), they need very good gear to do what other dps can doo so early in the game.<br />
<br />
It's very good to hear that the judgement refreshes, 1 extra bless and +3% raid crit/+2% group damage can give the retpally a spot in 25-man, but unfortunately that isn't enough to grant them the same spot in 5-man/5-man heroics (doesn't matter your gear) or 10-man raids (without very high gear). That's a fact today. And as you can remember, 5-man/heroics/10-man is where you should gear yourself for 25-man. Unless the raid is on easy farm, no guild would bring a ret pally in noob gear to 25-man, sorry. It's not fun to wait almost an entire expansion life cycle (and content nerfs) so every group can stand an almost dead weight on it.<br />
<br />
I liked the new ret stuff, but they're much more PVE focused (and very needed), but I'm not that sure about PVP eficiency.</div></div><hr />

If only &quot;10 failures&quot; against a boss give you one drop from him, your would be totally right.<br />
<br />
But since the number 1 rule in pve is &quot;no kill, no drop&quot;... would be interesting to see &quot;your team will only be elegible for this week arena points with 10 WINS&quot; instead of &quot;10 matches&quot;. But even that isn't worth anymore since honor gear is arena gear... S1 was alread good for some classes/specs (ret pally gear! good str, int, crit!), S2 is better than that (lol at my arms/fury warrior getting enough crit, almost HIT capped and good damage with pvp gear only! lol no random drops from diferent places).<br />
<br />
And really good for you that your guild farms so hard T6 content to a point where they can just give all the drops/tokens for you (assuming that all other 24 players don't need anything there, it's on farm and you're the only one needing gear). Also, nice to see that you can have your T6, rings, necks and warglaive set (if you're rogue or, who knows, fury warrior) in 3 weeks since the drops aren't random lol.<br />
<br />
Btw, if your tank is on the level to have a chance tanking illidan, we can all assume that he's not a &quot;Donald&quot; (from darklegacy). Can't see why he can't learn and do well tanking him the same way he can learn what to use/activate/kill 1st in arena/bg (is he prot in arena too?).<br />
<br />
Well, unless you're saying he's a total spamstring pvp moron who can just change to prot and tank Illidan (even being a complete stupid who doesn't know anything).</div></div><hr />

True, in pvp you can choose what items to replace first while in pve you cannot, on the other hand 8/16 of the gear avaible trough high-end pve is tier 6 gear which is, like you say, easy to get</div></div><hr />

you obviously didn't read my post, i assume your at 1500 rating with 5 wins and 5 losses/week, a team at 1400 rating gives very very very very few points and if you lose 10 games/week your rating is gonna drop to 1300 in no-time and you get like 150 points a week (or something around that number)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also you have never actually farmed an entire instance like BT?<br />
We clear BT in 2 days giving about 24 epics (12 tokens 12 items) which means 1 epic for everyone for 2 days of work, that takes 2 days of the week, in the other 3 days we raid we kill 2 bosses in SW and practise on third, meaning about 32 epics/week for a grp of 25 people..... you don't get that many items in pvp even if your at 2300 5v5 rating i believe</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Removing the fact that they did drop less tokens before and to clear BT in 2 days you have to do a huge investiment from the start (you don't go fresh 70 direct to BT the same way you can just go fresh 70 to S2 and arena gear), the loot is still random and you have to &quot;win your matches&quot;.<br />
<br />
The same way 24-man can drag you out to &quot;fast&quot; raid gear, you can be dragged in arena matches by good teams willing to give you good rates. But that's not the point, you're loosing only 10 matches/week (common, that's really really fast, way faster than doing BT), get some points, keep farming honor (wich IS fast) to increase your pvp (and why not pve with that? they're very good) gear. Can you keep farming a raid the entire week to get full S2/Vindicator/Guardian stuff? Ops... boss killed, your loot dropped or not, see you next week only buddy (with your guild/pug raid group of course, no &quot;join queue&quot; for crossrealm raids unfortunately).<br />
<br />
Did you get the point? Anyone can enter a BG and afk or join a arena match (anything, 2x2,3x3,5x5) without the need to win and get a high lvl gear. Not anyone can join a raid in a week and leave with the gear they want.<br />
<br />
As someone said once in blizzard forums &quot;why can't I trade my T4 token for T6 gear? I can use my S1 arena points to buy S3&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I supose they're your friends, right? With that you can probably do everything. The downside is that you can probably pug everything, your retradin friend unfortunately will have a very hard time doing that.<br />
<br />
Believe me, I have a retpally alt and everything he did was 90% due to my friends spending their time to group with me for instances. And I did my part in &quot;helping them helping me&quot; farming the fresh new S1 honor gear (so i could actually do something more than buff them).<br />
<br />
Even now, with full T4 LVL gear (and the real T4 parts are only the ones with +hit since only S3 gives it to ret), I have a really hard time joining a pug for heroics and even karazhan (for badge runs/rep).<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Holy is your PvP tree! ;D<br />
<br />
Eat it.<br />
I've been dealing with people telling me as an elemental shaman that resto is my PvP tree ever since TBC came out. Now everyone knows that elemental can be a fine PvP tree, but is it the PvP tree for maximum success? Absolutely not. Before you get gear you're a free kill. Once you're geared you had better be damn good because its not a &quot;roll face on keyboard for success&quot; spec.<br />
Maybe they don't intend Ret spec to be gods of PvP? You're playing a holy based class. You heal, you shield, and you get decent raid dps. You don't get to have it all. That's just the way it is. At least you have stuns and shields that when managed correctly results in high survivability. <br />
<br />
<br />
Currently in beta ret paladins are raping people without them being able to do a goddamn thing about it. The result of PvP shouldn't be based on whether or not you have a dispel trinket or not. Quit your whining. Your personal DPS is far too high for a class that has such utility. Thats something shamans learned long ago with the windfury nerfs and Lightning Overload changes. It doesn't matter if you lose a lot of your utility by speccing deep into a tree. It doesn't change the fact that those skills are still available to you.<br />
<br />
My healing is shit as an elemental shaman, but what kind of shaman would I be if I refused to use my heals at all because they are so bad. Id be a godawful shaman.<br />
<br />
Also...what was that crap about getting one-shot by casters in PvP? You fail. Show me ANY caster that can one-shot ANY class geared for pvp. The best I can do on a target with 400+ resil is about 3600... Maybe...MAYBE 6k on a LO proc. Last I checked most people with that much resil were approaching 11-12k health. Not a one shot. If you're dying like that then you are bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your an idiot.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you'd get out of karazan you would realize paladins are AWFUL pve healers in comparison to shammies, druids, and priests.<br />
<br />
I mean honestly man, a YEAR ago i was saying &quot;Paladins will be terrible healers in end game content as EVERY fight involves group/raid damage, and since paladins have ZERO raid heals they will be crappy healers in pve.&quot; <br />
<br />
And then they nerfed illumination and buffed spirit on other healers.<br />
<br />

I think this is all an itemisation BUG and should be fixed, not a nerf as to what ret is now<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not complaning about pve ret paladins but hell lets get into this anyways.<br />
<br />
#1 beacon of light is garbage. This is not new, everyone could tell when it first came out it was awful. Blizzard has said they will change it, but then again, blizzard has said ALOT of things over the years now. <br />
<br />
In fact most holy paladins are specing into Sheath of light half way down the ret tree instead of picking up useless holy talents.<br />
<br />
#2 I am also a 4/6 SW guild. I am ret, and we bring 2 holys (1 of which can and specs prot) pretty much for blessings... why? Well #1 they are 100% useless raid/group healers as we all know. But they are amazing tank heals right? Well they are the best tank healers, but a priest can do ALMOST as good of job as a paladin if they know what they are doing (i.e. dont stand there casting CoH). What is the point of bringing a paladin when you can just get a priest to do the same pretty much just as well as the paladin AND can also raid heal?<br />
<br />
#3 If any of you read what I actaully originally posted, you would see I am mostly complaining about Ret Paladins in PvP. Without any viable combat abilities (ie interrupt, ms debuff, mana burn or anything special) we will continue to be a joke. Please go to my link that I provided and read the stuff I have on that thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope everyone can agree this is over the top, especially against clothies with 0 resi who are getting one-shotted atm.<br />
<br />
I liked this part especially. Yes, ret paladin damage is prob OP and needs to be nerfed. But if you are comparing damage against clothies with 0 resil than you don't kno what ur talking about. A warrior can equally destroy a priest with 0 resil in 3 shots, so what? Fact of the matter is that resilience is apart of the game and anyone that pvps at all has 400 resil.<br />
<br />
Thus resilience has (and this hints at a topic in that post I linked) allowed clothies and priests and squishy targets to OVERCOME their main drawback... a 450 resil priest is just as hard to kill as a 450 resil paladin - the plate doesnt do all that much difference when u can never crit. But does pvp gear help a holy paladin resist interrupts (their main drawback)? Or does pvp gear give ret paladins a 10 second CD interrupt or MS or anything useful (their main drawback)? No.<br />
<br />
Seriously, read the highlights of the 20+ page post I linked on page 3 of this thread and learn something but I dont have the time or room to discuss everything here. Though believe me, I have never, ever, been wrong when dealing with this game, its balance, or its mechanics and I am so confident in that statement I can say it here and anywhere else.<br />
<br />
Blizzard said they were changing paladins but in comparison to the changes that other classes are getting I dont see anything all that new or game altering. You could give me a TON more dps or you can take it away. Without active abilities and buttons to press, however, I will still be useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
BETTER CONTENT! If its longer it means theres better gear, its more fun, you get to know your raid memebers more and its, again, better content. Take BT and SWP for example: they have great gear and their fun because there long. I dont want heroics to lasts hours though, but raids yes. Because raids are meant to be done with a guild and friends and harder to pug harder content but heroics are easier to pug and should be short. Thats what i at least think<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm a raider. I'll offer a counter.<br />
<br />
They aren't fun because they're long. They're fun because they were designed well with fun encounters. Shadow Labs is long, but not really fun. Shattered Halls as well. Kara? Fun. SSC, kinda meh.</div></div><hr />
