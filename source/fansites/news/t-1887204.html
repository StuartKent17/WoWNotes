Blue Posts<br />
On Inactivity and Freeing Names<br />
In general names are taken in WoW on a &quot;first come, first served&quot; basis. We do realise that having the name of your dreams taken by an inactive character can be a pretty disheartening experience, particularly in cases where you may be moving from one realm to another.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft has a lot of different types of players, some choose to just focus on a handful of characters and work to getting them to max level and beyond, while others play a large number of characters across multiple realms but may get hardly any to max level. We have to strike a fine balance in this regard as no playstyle is any less &quot;valid.&quot; No matter which period of inactivity we choose to go for, it will always be too long for someone, and too short for someone else. Ultimately we landed on our current policy which you can see at:<br />

Having said that, there has been a lot of great feedback in this thread which I will be forwarding on. Thanks for taking the time to constructively share your thoughts about this matter!

Overwatch Beta FAQ<br />
Q. How can I opt-in to the Overwatch Closed Beta?<br />
A. To opt into the beta, visit your Beta Profile Settings page in Account Management, check the &quot;Overwatch&quot; box under &quot;Beta Tests I'm Interested In,&quot; and then click &quot;Update Preferences.&quot; Alternatively, you can also sign up by clicking here.<br />
<br />
Please note that opting in will not guarantee you access to the Closed Beta.<br />
<br />
Q. How are Closed Beta participants selected?<br />
A. Beta testers are chosen based on many factors, including your Battle.net region, when you signed up, your computer hardware specifications, and an element of luck. We are also inviting select journalists and community contributors from around the world on a case-by-case basis.<br />
<br />
Q. How will I know if I'm selected to participate in the Closed Beta?<br />
A. If you are selected to participate in the Closed Beta, you will receive an invite via email. Invites will always be sent to the email address associated with your Battle.net account.<br />
<br />
To help avoid phishing attempts, if you believe you've received an invite, it's best to refrain from clicking on any links in the email(s) you receive. Instead, you can verify that your account has been granted a Closed Beta license in Battle.net Account Management.<br />
<br />
Q. Will there be any other ways to get into the Closed Beta besides opting-in?<br />
A. Not at this time. Also, please note that Overwatch beta keys do not exist. Access to the Closed Beta will be provided solely through account flagging.<br />
<br />
Q. How many players do you plan to invite to the Closed Beta?<br />
A. The number of players we invite will be largely based on our testing needs. We also want to make sure the game’s matchmaking system remains in a relatively healthy place throughout this phase of testing. As a result, if we determine we need more players to test new features or keep matches running smoothly, we’ll continue to add people to the Closed Beta from our opt-in pool.<br />
<br />
Q. What gameplay regions is the Closed Beta available in?<br />
A. The Closed Beta is currently available in the Americas and Europe gameplay regions. We have plans to bring the beta to our Asia gameplay region at a later date. For more information on which countries are associated with each of our gameplay regions, click here.<br />
<br />
Game performance for players in some regions, such as Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia, and Central and South America may be sub-optimal during the beta. If you experience issues with gameplay like high latency, excessive loading times, or long matchmaking queues, please be sure to post in our beta forums so that we can work to make improvements.<br />
<br />
Q. What languages are supported in the Closed Beta?<br />
A.The Closed Beta currently supports 10 languages: English, French, German, Castilian Spanish, Polish, Italian, Russian, Latin American Spanish, and Brazilian Portuguese. Localization is not yet complete for all languages, however, so some content may still appear in English during the beta.<br />
<br />
Q. If I get invited to the Closed Beta, can I stream or create content about the game?<br />
A. Absolutely! There is no non-disclosure agreement (NDA) for the Closed Beta. You are encouraged to take screenshots, livestream your play sessions, record feedback videos—whatever your heart desires. The game is still a work in progress, though, so we appreciate your understanding when you encounter bugs, graphical errors, or other issues.<br />
<br />
Q. Can I run tournaments with a prize pool during the Closed Beta?<br />
A. Yes! You are welcome to run tournaments (with or without prize pools) during the Closed Beta. However, given the size and scope of this phase of beta, we will not be issuing tournament licenses for large-scale events with prize pools over $10k. For smaller events, please review our Community Tournament Guidelines before you begin planning to make sure your community tournament is in compliance.<br />
<br />
If you would like to begin discussing your tournament plans for after game launch, or have any other questions, feel free to reach out to tourneyinfo@blizzard.com any time.<br />
<br />
Q. How long will the Closed Beta last?<br />
A. This phase of the Closed Beta will conclude before the end of the year. We don't have an exact date to share at this time, but we'll be sure to provide testers with advanced notice.<br />
<br />
Q. Will any progress I make during the Closed Beta carry over to the live game?<br />
A. No. We've no plans at this time for your activity during the Closed Beta to carry over.<br />
<br />
Q. If I don't get into the Closed Beta, am I guaranteed access to a Beta Test Weekend?<br />
A. No. While Beta Test Weekends will include a much larger number of players than Closed Beta, they will also be invite-only. You'll need to opt-in to the Overwatch beta to be eligible.<br />
<br />
Q. How do I opt-in to the Beta Test Weekends?<br />
A. There is no special opt-in process for Beta Test Weekends. If you opted-in for the beta, you're all set!<br />
<br />
As a reminder: To opt into the beta, visit your Beta Profile Settings page in Account Management, check the &quot;Overwatch&quot; box under &quot;Beta Tests I'm Interested In,&quot; and then click &quot;Update Preferences.&quot; Alternatively, you can also sign up by clicking here.<br />
Again, please note that opting in will not guarantee you access to a Beta Test Weekend. <br />

The prupose of the beta is not to bind player to the game - so what does it make a difference if a beta youtuber will play after beta or not?<br />
Publicity has more value - you guys will play overwatch no matter if you get into beta or not - so why bother putting you into the beta and losing the opportunity to get a proper publicity from youtubers.

A beta test should be about testing the game and making it fit for release, they can do the whole hype thing later on when they know it works.<br />
<br />
And with streamers doing the testing, half the time they are talking to chat etc and not paying attention to stuff going on in the game.</div></div><hr />

Actually, beta nowadays are more and more to bind to the game. Specially Blizzard since they give stuff for participating in the beta (wich means you'll get invested in the game later since you've got something &quot;exclusive&quot;, like putting money in Hearthstone beta and getting a special card or hots and get mount/portrait...).<br />
<br />
And really, in the true sense, beta would be for testing, feedback, improvement, changing. Those guys aren't testing at all... basically most players aren't, that's the reason most of the time these beta testing with &quot;millions of players&quot; usually fail to deliver and you get the final game with plenty of bugs or things that should be changed before release, but they only got the real feedback after it (like the many of mistakes in WoD). The only thing this kind of beta testing gets done is the stress testing of servers.<br />
<br />
The &quot;mediocre&quot; feedback are the ones that really matter and are far better than the 0 feedbacks from youtubers and the like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Those things aren't mutually exclusive....what's your point, exactly? Yes, mediocre feedback is better than 0, but being a youtuber hardly means that you give 0 feedback, far from it actually, if its a youtuber worth their salt, he should most definitely be giving feedback in their videos that everyone else sees.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
I mean seriously, do any of you spouting &quot;only streamers got invites&quot; actually have ANY proof at all? Or are you all just salty as fuck? Of course streamers got keys, its to build hype, but just because you didnt get an invite, that doesn't mean noone else does. I mean you're not going to see people on here complaining that they got a key are you? No, because they're going to be playing it.</div></div><hr />

The streamer ended up playing for approximately 1 hour and then went to play CS:GO until the stream was over.</div></div><hr />

it is an 8 week rotation now. I would not expect any chance of it being in November though since the patch has barely hit beta and we still have several weeks of season 2 for PVP.<br />

As far as the beta goes, I love all of the people crying over the fact that they expected to get a beta key and they say they make a living on streaming games.

Probably ran the numbers and found that the costs of development and maintenance were not worth the small amount of people who play on mac os. Just use boot camp is their philosophy.<br />
<br />
Real talk though. The people complaining that the game wont run on XP need to wake up. No developer is going to make a game compatible with an operating system that is no longer supported by its creator. XP has gone the way of windows 2000 and its time to move on.</div></div><hr />

It is impressive that you know that for a fact that most people they invited wont report bugs. <br />
<br />
Also blizzard watches a lot of streamers on twitch so the best way to get feedback is by watching their streams while they play the game.<br />
<br />

My exact feelings, looks like once my sub expires at the end of december I'll be hanging it up until Legion. Not going to sit here in HFC until may/june if we're lucky.</div></div><hr />

As they add more and more events the time between them is going to become ridiculously long. Suppose you really enjoy the pet battle event; the way things are going now eventually you may only be able to do it once every few months. Having more than one event per week would also be nice in the case the weekly event is something you care nothing about. If you don't pvp and have no interest in it the Arena week event must be a real bummer. Either that or make the events shorter. Waiting 8 weeks for your favorite event seems way too long.</div></div><hr />
