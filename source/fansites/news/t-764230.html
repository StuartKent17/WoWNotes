Tol Barad Focus Test w/ Devs<br />
We are planning to do a focused playtest on Tol Barad on Monday the 27th at 4pm PST. We would like to get as many players out there on the beta to help us as possible. You must be level 85 to join the battle. We will speed up the game timer so we can play multiple games during the test.<br />
<br />
I will make a new feedback post after we finish the test for everyone to post in. Feedback is very important for us at this point so please take your time and try to be as concise as possible with your findings.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help! <br />

Guild Leveling<br />
25-Man Raids Achievements<br />
We just made a change to all of the old 25 player raids that allows guild achievements to be completed as if they were a 10 player raid. This means you will only need 8/10 instead of 20/25.<br />
<br />
Get hyped. =) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560501163/guild-achievements-for-classic-dungeons-raids/))<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Dungeon Finder average iLVL<br />
The built-in Blizzard number is an average of the best piece of gear in every slot. It counts equipped gear as well as your bags and banks. It is meant as a general measurement of whether you're capable of handling a dungeon or not, and shouldn't be taken too seriously as a measurement of awesomeness. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850247490/rogues-12984-dealing-less-damage-than-tanks/))<br />
<br />
GCD Locked<br />
This is a good start, but there are other reasons we don't like being GCD locked. It means you can never take even a moment to look around and notice the battlefield, notice who is in trouble, maybe shout something out on Vent. If you have a situational utility ability, or even are asked to do something unusual on a boss fight, you're reluctant because you need those GCDs for more dps!!!!<br />
<br />
(Usually when I say that, the response is &quot;I can multitask!&quot; But the reality doesn't always match that boast. What we see instead if players complaining about e.g. movement fights because that means they can't always get to step 6 of a 6 step damage rotation.)<br />
<br />
Even more importantly, we also want design space for ourselves. When your spec is GCD locked, you have to start ignoring things like procs or free resources, because you can't spend them without screwing up your rotation.<br />
<br />
That said, we know that being GCD locked is a really subjective issue. Some players like hitting a button every 1.5 (or 1.0) seconds and feel like they are waiting around when that doesn't happen. Fury warriors and the dps paladins who can't necessarily hit a button every 1.5 sec now have found their Cataclysm versions of the classes to feel almost foreign... though we still think it will feel better in the long run. I worry a little about the overall health of our game if going 1.5 seconds without hitting a button bores you to tears. :( Overall, I think everyone would have more fun if they focused more on beating the boss as a team and less on their individual contribution to that effort.<br />
<br />
We also know that some players are just really intolerant of randomness. They make the logical leap from understanding that dealing with randomness is a challenge they need to overcome to campaigning for us to remove the randomness altogether. This is particularly true in PvP, which some players want to be more like a button masher fighting game and less like an RPG. Suffice to say that we think randomness is healthy and necessary as long as it doesn't get out of control. Even though you may claim it's the easiest thing in the world to hit that Pyroblast button when Hot Streak procs, we also know that dps can vary enormously even between relatively skilled and fantastically skilled players, and a great deal of that is using the right abilities at the right time.

GCD Locked<br />
Now with regard to DKs specifically, we think what is happening is that players are transfering characters in at 80 and ending up with 40% haste or whatever because of the way gear was converted on their character (no mastery, no armor pen). Once you get closer to 85, you won't have that much haste. You may be GCD locked for short periods of time when the stars align and you get a bunch of procs at once, but you'll also go streaks without those procs. This is still a world of difference from the DK on live, whose rotation collapses if they fail to get off a Plague Strike, or who can't even take advantage of free runes or procs, or who just have to reroll if they experience the unfortunate but also inevitable lag that comes with playing an online game.<br />
<br />
Now, if you're one of those players who just hates gaps, then go ahead and stack a bunch of haste. You'll have to go out of your way to do that though, and sacrifice some other stats to get there. For the DK that balances gear out, you shouldn't be GCD locked for long periods of time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859119693/please-settle-the-rune-empowerment-debate/))<br />

Protection and Holy Power<br />
If we give Protection ways to generate more Holy Power, then that opens the door for getting both Inquisition and Shield of the Righteous going at the same time. As soon as that's possible, you're going to assume you have to do both to be competitive, and whenever you can't keep both up, you're going to be frustrated.

Retribution in WotLK<br />
Ret was broken. If you don't see eye to eye with us on that, then it's understandable why the degree of change might be surprising to you. We tried to advertise that change was coming for a long time because we didn't want anyone to be surprised when it happened. Many players, including many Ret players, were just not happy with the mechanics of the spec in Lich King. I can understand if you just happened to love your character the way he or she was, but unfortunately, that doesn't give us much room to maneuver in attempting to implement a design that we will be happy with, and ultimately many players (though it will never be all) will be as well.

Quality of life<br />
Power Word: Fortitude no longer requires candles. Poor candle vendors. :(<br />
<br />
Power Word: Shield does not require the target to be in your party or raid today on Live. We made this change in 3.3 IIRC.<br />
<br />
We still want Shadowform to be a little bit of a tradeoff. If you have all the utility of a healer and can do competitive damage with any caster, then why would players want to be anything else?<br />
<br />
We agree that the number of self buffs feels high. We'll try and think of a way to address that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26859149953/shadow-priest-quality-of-life-issues/))<br />
<br />
Discipline Priest<br />
There is an optional Discipline build where you take Atonement/Archangel and you can use Smite on the tanked target, and have higher HPS than if you just chain Heal the tank. This isn’t always optimal, as Atonement heals the lowest health target (which could be a Rogue standing in a fire), but that’s not always such a bad thing in Cataclysm’s environment where the MT doesn’t have to be spam healed. That said, we think it is interesting gameplay unique to the Disc priest.<br />
<br />
In an upcoming build, when you critically hit with Smite your Atonement will critically heal (and cause Divine Aegis).<br />
<br />
We’ve also optimized some of the talents, and pruned some of the 3-pointers down to 2-pointers and also reduced the mana cost of Power Word: Barrier throughout the tree.<br />
<br />
We’re toning Spiritual Guidance down to bring the healing mount between Discipline and Holy closer together, Holy’s “talent tree passive” is currently stronger than intended than Discipline’s.<br />
<br />
We want Disc to be able to do any raid job, but we are also trying not to just have every healer use the same retinue of spells. If the situation arises, they should be able to Prayer of Heal, Holy Nova, Prayer of Mending for comparable healing throughput / efficiency as Holy can to raid heal. The only difference is Holy can be in a Chakra state which increases the healing done, but then again Disc can heal for 30%+ (depending on Mastery) with Divine Aegis and can also cast free Prayer of Healing with Inner Focus.

Combat DPS<br />
Yep. I can tell you right now that Combat's dps is a little low. This is a known issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850247490/rogues-12984-dealing-less-damage-than-tanks/))<br />

<br />
If you think that Retris currently push buttons in a rotation, then you are a very bad Retri and shouldn't be complaining.<br />
<br />
The changes make Retris more like Rogues, with core yellow attacks that build resource points, a finisher that consumes them and scales with the number of resource points you have, and a DPS buff that also uses resource points and must be juggled with your finisher. The difference is that where Rogues have several finishers to select from but only one core attack, Paladins have several resource-generating attacks but only one finisher. This makes them tougher to play and generally more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They just have never been conformable with Pally dps period. <br />
<br />
What I always found bizarre is that back in the day like pre-patch 1.7 people were saying that Blizz had an easy way to fix Holy, Ret, and Prot. That ever point spent in one tree cost you an ability. Meaning if you went Ret you got more and more DPS abilities and lost more and healing and prot/defensive abilities. <br />
<br />
Essentially as you marched further down the road toward retribution you lost your ability to heal and protect others. So by the time you went full Ret spec, you lost the bubble for your ultimate at the end and your heals were let better than bandages. But you were beastly like caster/melee hybrid.<br />
<br />
But it seemed Blizz lost their nerve for some reason, as if they felt the Pallies that would be created would be too hard to use or be too strong and diminish the other melee classes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deplorable</div><div class="date">2010-09-25, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">can't believe Blizzard said that with a staight face &quot;retribution paladins have been broken in Wotlk&quot; - they've been broken since 1.9 !<br />
<br />
Blizzard have never, NEVER, been able to get retribution right, and now we're more screwed up in more ways than possible even talent wise. Take a look at Guardians Favour Tier 2, yeah we don't get HoF until late 50's fantastic.. only half useful. Wait when was the last time, as a retribution paladin, you actually used HoB, be honest now.. the last time? exactly. maybe 2nd boss in pit of saron if someone was half asleep during the &quot;chase&quot;.<br />
<br />
that's it, useless. HoB should be removed, HoF in Guardians favour should be joined with Acts of Sacrifice further up the Tier, and maybe blizzard will keep it's promise to get rid of &quot;useless talents&quot;. Give divine storm only mana useage. At the moment it's just stupid.<br />
<br />
We have mana, holy power, and more buttons than we've ever had as retribution and most of our damaging attacks which could only hurt demons can hurt everyone now (i was still a little bit confused why exorcism in Wotlk could hurt normal people). Now Wrath can as well.<br />
<br />
We're more AoE because of that than we've ever been, it's like Blizzard says one thing and does the complete opposite when it comes to retribution paladins.<br />
<br />
Zealotry is a waste of time, you try getting 3 holy power without even being tempted to use it because all we're spamming is &quot;crusader strike&quot; - we're a ONE BUTTON unit. Seriously 4.5 seconds, we'll be taking HASTE all the time to get that down.. 14 seconds to hit zealotry, then once that starts, and we're not dead.<br />
<br />
we might be useful, but it's still NOT consistent DPS we're more burst than we've ever been, something Blizzard never wanted.<br />
<br />

It counts equipped gear as well as your bags and banks. It is meant as a general measurement of whether you're capable of handling a dungeon or not, and shouldn't be taken too seriously as a measurement of awesomeness.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the dumbest. f'ing. idea. I've ever heard GC post.<br />
<br />
OK so I know I'm about to paint a big ridicule target on my back but...I *like* RP gear. I love my FelIron crafted set. I found a matching green cloak and green swords and call myself the Green Goblin. I love my Cobalt set, also with matching blue cloak and blue axe. I even love some of the stuff I found while chasing Loremaster like the Exodus Bastard sword (I wave that at my Draenai friends when they are being bastards) or the cool Feline face mask from Hellfire Pennisula.<br />
<br />
So because my bank and bags are chock full over gear that, on average, probably is somewhere around the mid 20's and 30's what the hell is that supposed to mean when I go to queue? It's one thing to say &quot;here's an average of the highest iLevels you've equipped in each slot: 257.2&quot; -- that seems fair and useful. But to go through bank and bags? W. T. F. And then to actually use that number as *any* kind of measurement is just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
Hell, DK's start out the game with nothing less than level 60 epic blues. You can even apply level 60+ Lich King enchantments to them despite being level 58 when you come out of Eastern Plaguelands. So a DK automatically is going to have a much higher average, having never touch any gear lower than 60.<br />
<br />
I really don't know the context, and trying to read through the thread to find exactly what GC was referring to (how that number is used in LFG or what) but...the fact that it is even calculated this way is just plain moronic.<br />
<br />
/end lol RP-freak rant<br />
<br />
Edit: OK someone pointed out the context that it DOES only look at the highest iLevel item for each slot...even if (for some god unknown reason) you leave it in your bank. OK, crisis averted never mind my rant. XD</div></div><hr />

He saying that the dungeon finder calculates your gear level by taking the highest item level item that you own for each gear slot (like head, neck, shoulder, etc) and averaging them together. It does not penalize you for having loads of low ilvl crap on your character/in your bags/bank because it only takes the best that you have into account.</div></div><hr />

It's not gonna count your RP gear unless it's your best gear.<br />
<br />
The game looks through all your bags, bank, and gear slots, finds the best gear you have, and uses that. I would imagine it is spec smart, meaning if I am a Paladin, and I have a bitchin' tank set, but I queue as a healer and am just starting a healing set, it's not going to count all my defense stamina gear into the equation when I queue as a healer, thus dropping me in, say, HoR when I should be in UK or DTK.<br />
<br />
See what I mean? It's not ALL your gear. It's your BEST gear. This is to avoid people, say, equipping crap, or getting naked, and queueing so they get UK and then re-equip awesome gear and faceroll the place.</div></div><hr />

I know know why they just didn't say &quot;8/25&quot; ...that sounds like it would have made it a lot clearer. But this still doesn't answer the original question of, do you really have to drag 8 people along for MC? Which can be solo'd or 2-man'd? :\<br />
<br />
Look at the math, it's so freaking obvious how they could solve it. 8/10, 20/25...it's 80%. So, in order for ________ (anything) to count as a &quot;guild-run&quot; then 80% of the participants need to be in the guild. (maybe 2-person minimum since technically 1 person isn't supposed to even be in a raid group).<br />
<br />
2 guild members alone in MC? 100% guild members, guild run.<br />
<br />
4 guild members, 1 non in BWL? 80% guild members, guild run.<br />
<br />
4 guild members, 2 non in BWL? Whoops, now only 60% guild members, not a guild run.<br />
<br />
Now for bonus points... what happens under the current change when you have 8 people from Guild A and 8 people from Guild B in the same 25 man raid? :\</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing they think old raids should be done 'socially', as in, with people from your guild. Rather than have a few people do it solo/2-manned a bit anti-socially. Hmm.<br />

<br />
EXCEPT...these old raids are now part of the Guild achievement system in two ways, the legendary weapons and the exalted rep.<br />
<br />
There is no benefit to dragging six more people to duplicate these efforts. Eight people getting Sulfuras is a ridiculous idea when two people can farm the entire instance and concentrate all the drops on one person. Eight people getting exalted with Hydraxian is a waste of effort when one or two can farm and turn in all the rep items themselves.<br />
<br />
People already do these old raids socially as a guild...for the achivement. Some go a little further and farm their T1 or T2 sets.<br />
<br />
But asking a whole guild to &quot;socially grind&quot; is really unnecessary. Hell, most guilds don't have enough time in the week to run all the current content, let alone sacrificing a Thursday to have &quot;Old Grinding Night&quot;.<br />
<br />
Let some guild members grind professions, some grind XP, some grind weapons, some grind rep...diving up the effort, not senseless duplication of efforts.<br />
<br />
Especially considering that all the legendary can only be equipped by one or two classes. Asking a hunter to grind Elementium ingots for a mace he cant use when he'd be better off running Sunwell for the bow is just poor design imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I agree with this.<br />
<br />
Its not perfect (Ret may always be the red headed step child of the DPS specs) but it was not broken in fact its the best and funnest version yet. The ironic part is that the blue posts are not saying what people on the PTR's are. That the new Ret is not ready yet, that its not normalized and that it will be must better at 85 and with correct gear, its just new and different and when your used to it, ultimately it will work out fine.<br />
<br />
I just want a blue post that out lines the problems they felt with the class how they tried to fix it over the years and what this build is intended to do. Finally what the complete and overall goal in PvP and PvE is for Ret pallies. So that if they makes changes we know what the goal is so when the QQ starts we Retadins can be hit over the head with those to shut us up.<br />
<br />
But they won't so this will continue till the end of WoW.</div></div><hr />

Instead of pushing 4-5 buttons in a rotation now we push 2 button majority of the time and a few other buttons every once in awhile.<br />
<br />
Currently Ret IS broken, we all know this:P<br />
<br />
On live the buttons you press (with the only &quot;planning&quot; being, I'll hit the thing that comes of cooldwon first ololo) are: CS, DS, Judge, exo and hammer of wrath.<br />
That's 3 attacks that you know when are coming off cd, and 2 attacks which needs proc or low health to us. that's 5, ok, of which 3 are used the most. You can ofc use concecration if the mana allows it. The dmg cooldowns you need to use are : Wings<br />
<br />
On ptr you have: CS, judge, exo, Templars verdict and hammer of wrath. You got DS for AoE now (altering which spells to use when AoE'ing, that's good). They are also working on making Holy wrath usefull more often too :) That's 6 confirmed attack, of which 3 are used the most, and 3 are situational. But keep in mind HoW can be used druing wings too now.<br />
The dmg cooldowns you need to use are: Wings, Zealotry, Guardian and Inquisition (this one you need to manage quite often too). Again, Concecration can be used, but it's gonna hurt your mana bad :P<br />
In cata there will also be times when you need to use survival cd's or even off heal or heal yourself to help the healer, and thus helping the raid.<br />
<br />
How you can possible say ret becomes more boring is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

Especially considering that all the legendary can only be equipped by one or two classes. Asking a hunter to grind Elementium ingots for a mace he cant use when he'd be better off running Sunwell for the bow is just poor design imo.<br />
<br />
You are totally, entirely and utterly missing the point. Do you also open up your achievement pane and think &quot;oh my god!! I don't have time to do all these achievements! Blizzard sucks!&quot;. I look at my achievements pane and cherry pick the ones that I'd really like to do.<br />
<br />
The same with guild achievements: they are not required to be done. Nobody is forcing you or your guild to do them. You don't get really phat lewtz from them or anything. They are just there for fun. I understand you must be in a guild which only does &quot;current&quot; raids and only has time for that. Well that's fine, but then you won't get these guild achievements, too bad. But it doesn't matter much.<br />
<br />
I'm in a guild which is always having a lot of fun. We tried some Icecrown Citadel because we liked it, but some other weeks we didn't bother with ICC but went to Ulduar instead because we liked it and it was a while ago that we did it. And then I gathered some people and did a Naxxramas achievement run, because it was fun.<br />
<br />
I imagine the same happening with these guild achievements. If you want to be a lonely emo kid then by all means solo it, if you want to. No problem, really, not at all. But if you want to have some guild fun and want to get the guild achievement, just get some guildies, get on vent and have a lot of fun going through the instance. It's not a matter of &quot;omg I can solo this so why should I do it with more!?&quot;. It's a matter of &quot;do I find it fun to do it with multiple people?&quot;.<br />
<br />
Another example. Me and a guildie we can both solo MGT just fine, and we both kind of want the mount. So your logic dictates we should both solo it, so we have more chances for the mount, etc. But instead we group some days just because it's more fun that way. And then some times we do some other old instances too, even ones we already have the achievement for. For fun. And no, we are not wasting time. Because if having fun is wasting time, you should stop playing because then the entire game is wasting time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The changes make Retris more like Rogues, with core yellow attacks that build resource points, a finisher that consumes them and scales with the number of resource points you have, and a DPS buff that also uses resource points and must be juggled with your finisher. The difference is that where Rogues have several finishers to select from but only one core attack, Paladins have several resource-generating attacks but only one finisher. This makes them tougher to play and generally more fun.<br />
<br />
Several resource-generating attacks? We have 1 resource-generating attack and the rest of them is all RNG, it's extremely boring. Also calling me bad is laughable since I took a 10 month break from the game and came back in 245/258 gear and beating Rets in 264/277 gear. Our current priority system is much entertaining then this new HP model. I guess it's just personal preference because having to hit CS-&gt;HoW-&gt;Judge-&gt;DS-&gt;Conc-&gt;Exo in that priority order is much more entertaining then hitting Judge-&gt;CS-&gt;CS-&gt;TV and then hitting CS-&gt;CS-&gt;TV for majority of the fight with other abilities in every once in awhile. Atleast now it wasn't a straight forward rotation, it currently can end up being CS-&gt;Judge-&gt;DS-&gt;CS-&gt;Conc-&gt;Exo-&gt;CS-&gt;Judge-&gt;CS or even completely different depending on how much haste you have. Basically it's never a set rotation on live but it will be which is boring.</div></div><hr />

Ret was broken. If you don't see eye to eye with us on that, then it's understandable why the degree of change might be surprising to you. We tried to advertise that change was coming for a long time because we didn't want anyone to be surprised when it happened. Many players, including many Ret players, were just not happy with the mechanics of the spec in Lich King.

True, but....<br />
<br />
They'll need to have the DVDs made somewhere, you know. They need to start arriving in shops about half a week in advance (such that every Gamestation, HMV, amazon warehouse, 24/7 supermarket, etc. in the entire western world has copies to sell), they need to start being sent out about a week before that (travel time), and be printed and boxed a week before that (the numbers of copies needed will be insane). <br />
<br />
Basically, getting the DVDs to the shops takes time, and there's only 5 weeks before Boub's 2nd Nov estimate... maybe that's the right date, maybe it's not, but either way, I reckon they'll need their release date to be very much set in stone by now for a pre-xmas launch.</div></div><hr />

I hope so too, but I doubt it. It doesn't work like that now either. Plenty of fresh tanks with awesome dps gear end up as tank in HoR, because their avg gearlevel is high, even though it's dps and not tank gear.</div></div><hr />

It counts equipped gear as well as your bags and banks. It is meant as a general measurement of whether you're capable of handling a dungeon or not, and shouldn't be taken too seriously as a measurement of awesomeness.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is the dumbest. f'ing. idea. I've ever heard GC post.<br />
<br />
OK so I know I'm about to paint a big ridicule target on my back but...I *like* RP gear. I love my FelIron crafted set. I found a matching green cloak and green swords and call myself the Green Goblin. I love my Cobalt set, also with matching blue cloak and blue axe. I even love some of the stuff I found while chasing Loremaster like the Exodus Bastard sword (I wave that at my Draenai friends when they are being bastards) or the cool Feline face mask from Hellfire Pennisula.<br />
<br />
So because my bank and bags are chock full over gear that, on average, probably is somewhere around the mid 20's and 30's what the hell is that supposed to mean when I go to queue? It's one thing to say &quot;here's an average of the highest iLevels you've equipped in each slot: 257.2&quot; -- that seems fair and useful. But to go through bank and bags? W. T. F. And then to actually use that number as *any* kind of measurement is just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
Hell, DK's start out the game with nothing less than level 60 epic blues. You can even apply level 60+ Lich King enchantments to them despite being level 58 when you come out of Eastern Plaguelands. So a DK automatically is going to have a much higher average, having never touch any gear lower than 60.<br />
<br />
I really don't know the context, and trying to read through the thread to find exactly what GC was referring to (how that number is used in LFG or what) but...the fact that it is even calculated this way is just plain moronic.<br />
<br />
/end lol RP-freak rant<br />
<br />
Edit: OK someone pointed out the context that it DOES only look at the highest iLevel item for each slot...even if (for some god unknown reason) you leave it in your bank. OK, crisis averted never mind my rant. XD<br />

<br />
<br />
And the whole reason Blizzard is stuck in this mess is because they have no spec-exclusivity and don't have the balls to attach penalties to the new class masteries.<br />
<br />
All they have to do is attach either a hidden or reg effect that says...uh... Increase damage taken by 10% and reduces effectiveness of heals by 20% while a part of the Retrubition tree.<br />
<br />
WOW THAT WAS SO HARD!<br />
<br />
But no, instead let's mess with abilities and scaling that can't EVER affect the other two trees, cause it's talent abilities! No. let's unrealistically balance the class around a scale none of them can ever ride on without one or two spec being broken.<br />
<br />
Create mastery penalties and then bathe in the gloriousness of being able to BUFF *gasp*, that's right boys and girls, being able to buff classes! Without worrying about how the new DPS is going to affect healer/tank specs, or how new tanking/healing abilities are going to overpower DPS.<br />

There's no way they're gonna make Nov 2 at this point. A pre-Christmas launch is not guaranteed: BC launched in January. The vast majority of people buying Cataclysm are going to be current players, Christmas is *not* that big a deal with WoWs market demographic. We'll buy it when it comes out. They may get a few extra sales from a Christmas release, but if it comes down to a few percentage point bump from being out in time for Christmas, vs releasing completely buggy crap and pissing off the player base, they'll wait.</div></div><hr />

Ret was broken. If you don't see eye to eye with us on that, then it's understandable why the degree of change might be surprising to you. We tried to advertise that change was coming for a long time because we didn't want anyone to be surprised when it happened. Many players, including many Ret players, were just not happy with the mechanics of the spec in Lich King. I can understand if you just happened to love your character the way he or she was, but unfortunately, that doesn't give us much room to maneuver in attempting to implement a design that we will be happy with, and ultimately many players (though it will never be all) will be as well. <br />
<br />
<br />
And on that note FUCK YOU I QUIT!<br />
<br />
Look I know where you are coming from.<br />
<br />
Back in the day we Pallies were promised that our issues would be addressed with upcoming patches. Then it turned out that no one in the dev teams played pallies and we were sad and QQ'ed till we could QQ no more. Then came BC and we felt finally steps in right direction, but shorty there after we were kinda forgotten about. But hope was on the horizon once again Wrath dropped and a lot of the Pallies concerns were finally being not just addressed but fixed. So for the first time pallies felt more useful rather than heal bots that were brought along for buffs mostly. We could tank okay and dps was better than ever. But then were slowly nerfed as time went on (the Lay on Hands thing was what they meant about changes coming) which for all the QQ about it Pallies started thinking and saying the forums 'Okay we are not happy about it but if gets us more DPS you take away even the bubble.' Blizz gave no response only that it was imbalanced against the other classes. Apparently in world (since no one plays BG's for rank and there are no Ret pally uber teams in area) PvP pallies were child predators roaming the world in pink plate bringing the horror and pwnage on to the people of Azeroth. Now we are told we are broken and that change is coming. Now we all want it and will all bitch cause we are not used to it. But change is radical and makes us feel very burst damage oriented and we are not seeing the insane numbers the other classes are. Which unfortunately brings me to an old forum response I got back in the day to the problems with Pallies in pre-patch 1.7 days. 'If you wanna heal roll a priest, if you wanna tank role a Warrior and if you wanna DPS roll any other class cause they are never EVER gonna let pallies face roll people, just face it and move on.'</div></div><hr />

What we're doing now is storing the content in advance, so we can start playing immediately we attach a Cataclysm key to our accounts instead of having to go through a lengthy install process.</div></div><hr />

Well of course it won't be the best set ever, it's the first tier of raiding, it will get better again, once we get to 2nd or 3rd tier of raiding (I hope at least).<br />
<br />
But I guess it's okay, but definitely not one of my favorites. (Tier 2, Tier 5, Tier 8 and Tier 10 are defo my favorites ^^(although I did like all lock sets))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard have never, NEVER, been able to get retribution right, and now we're more screwed up in more ways than possible even talent wise. Take a look at Guardians Favour Tier 2, yeah we don't get HoF until late 50's fantastic.. only half useful. Wait when was the last time, as a retribution paladin, you actually used HoB, be honest now.. the last time? exactly. maybe 2nd boss in pit of saron if someone was half asleep during the &quot;chase&quot;.<br />
<br />
that's it, useless. HoB should be removed, HoF in Guardians favour should be joined with Acts of Sacrifice further up the Tier, and maybe blizzard will keep it's promise to get rid of &quot;useless talents&quot;. Give divine storm only mana useage. At the moment it's just stupid.<br />
<br />
We have mana, holy power, and more buttons than we've ever had as retribution and most of our damaging attacks which could only hurt demons can hurt everyone now (i was still a little bit confused why exorcism in Wotlk could hurt normal people). Now Wrath can as well.<br />
<br />
We're more AoE because of that than we've ever been, it's like Blizzard says one thing and does the complete opposite when it comes to retribution paladins.<br />
<br />
Zealotry is a waste of time, you try getting 3 holy power without even being tempted to use it because all we're spamming is &quot;crusader strike&quot; - we're a ONE BUTTON unit. Seriously 4.5 seconds, we'll be taking HASTE all the time to get that down.. 14 seconds to hit zealotry, then once that starts, and we're not dead.<br />
<br />
we might be useful, but it's still NOT consistent DPS we're more burst than we've ever been, something Blizzard never wanted.<br />
<br />
They say we were broken in Wotlk, we're far more broken and boring now than we've ever been.<br />
<br />
last time i used HOB was in arena against a mage and rogue to stop me getting CCed when my team mate was getting nuked so i used to to get damage to me to break cc</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rifee</div><div class="date">2010-09-28, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">lol what class is actually challenging? rets atm push more buttons then some other classes<br />
<br />
I was aiming more at the class in generall, meaning both in pvp and pve.<br />
Pushing more buttons does not equal more challenging.<br />
<br />
Ret pusht the buttons that light up, that's it. Sometimes they have to prioritise what cd they want to press first when they sometime get off cd at the same time, to no great gain or loss in dps.<br />
<br />
In pvp they are VERY simple and limited in what they can do, and need very good gear to acomplish anything. Then again when they get the best gear, they hit like fucking trucks. That's not good ballance:9 Again, yes very few specs are hard in pve, hell no class is hard to dps with.</div></div><hr />
