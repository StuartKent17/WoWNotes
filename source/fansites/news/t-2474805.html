Last Week of Azerite Knowledge for Season 2<br />
Today marks the last time that Azerite knowledge will lower the amount of Azerite power needed to level your Heart of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth) for the rest of season 2. Currently, the Heart of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth) level cap is 50. We don't know for sure what will happen with azerite power in 8.2, but Ion did mention a bit of what we can expect during a previous Q&amp;A stream (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8218-Tides-of-Vengeance-Developer-Q-A-Ion-Hazzikostas#heart). The clip below also shows Ion discussing this a little further.<br />
<br />
<br />
In 8.2, when you receive new pieces of Azerite Armor the trait rings will be fully unlocked based on your Heart of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth) level and you can make the choices on which traits you want right away without having to work to unlock them again.<br />
The Heart of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth) will utilize azerite power, allowing you to permanently earn powers and potentially active abilities to unlock through the neck piece itself, in a manner likely similar to your legion weapon.<br />

Crucible of Storms Loot Preview<br />
With the Crucible of Storms raid releasing next month, two new bosses will be available to defeat. Their loot tables offer many new rewards, most of which have a variety of small extra trinket-like effects instead of just stat upgrades. Some other things to note:<br />

What would this mean for the people that are still at 25-ish on their heart? Is it going yo be almost imposible to catch up?<br />

Every level gets the reduction even the ones you haven't unlocked yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are 25-ish then why would you care about catching up? At 25-ish you either got to 120 half an hour ago, or you literally don't play the game at all.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't hurt anything if a heroic raider or below has a piece of two of decently high level gear. The only problem really exists within Mythic as a portion of our community doesn't feel satisfied when a piece of gear doesn't forge instead of treating it like the treat it is when it happens. THey could cap TF at 5 levels below Mythic base for everything else and readjust each tier and then just not allow Mythic gear to forge at all. M+ could still award Mythic level gear. <br />
<br />
I mean a change isn't necessary but if one were to happen that's the one because the TF &quot;issue&quot; is exclusively OUR issue and everyone else shouldn't be punished for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you are at 25 heart level today, that's only 1000 azerite to get to 26. You can do one emissary and get a level and a half, not to mention the 4 quests that you do to complete the emissary. I just leveled a brand new alt to 120 and in about 3 days its already heart level 32 without any real effort. And I really mean that. I don't even do islands on that toon.</div></div><hr />

Tying the most rewarding ways to get azerite power to the most dull, boring ways to play the game is bad.

So here we are again in an expansion with a rapidly dwindling population because Blizzard is so out of touch with what people want. I have no motivation to roll alts because the idea of beating my head against an AP wall to try to even get as close to as functional as my main is destroying it.

I understand they want to try to make people feel like their character is progressing even after level cap - but gear does that just fine. It shouldn't have come as a system that is detrimental to people who like to play alts. We were already having to level and gear up these new characters.<br />

Tying the 2500 AP reward from island expeditions to also be rewarded for doing X number of mythic dungeons or clearing a raid for the week should be included. Let people do island expeditions if they want, but give us more enjoyable ways to earn that 2500 AP. Same with emissaries.</div></div><hr />

Considering that the weapons in the raid are giving up secondary stats for awful procs, be glad. Hunters already have that awful gun from Mekatorque to facepalm at anyways. You know, the one the had to buff massively 6 weeks after the raid opened because it was so awful.</div></div><hr />

If you don't want to do the content, you'll still get there eventually. If you only care about raiding or mythics, you'll get azerite from those. Even just doing the story line for Horde or Alliance will get you 750 azerite for every few quests. The game is handing you azerite from every source. You'll get it. When I said I have a fresh alt that's already 32, I meant it. I didn't even try to get levels on that toon. Its just happened while I tried to get gear for it. You get 450 azerite per raid boss.

The gain is incredibly minor, so there's no rush to hit 50 before the end of S2 looking at my own guild just for curiosities sake the average neck level seems to be about 45, the lowest being someone who re rolled to a freshly leveled toon a few weeks back who is on 40.</div></div><hr />

I don't buy the &quot;out of touch&quot; thing anymore. They've been flooded with feedback for years, on what players like and want. They cannot claim they don't have a clue, as so much of it was on their own beta forums. They have openly spoken about the deep metrics they pull out of the game, and they're gonna turn around and say &quot;Gee, we thought you liked world quests and azerite funtime islands?&quot; Nah. Don't buy it, not anymore. <br />
<br />
It's not that they're out of touch, they just don't care. This is the game &quot;The Team&quot; (ie. Ion) wants, this is what you're getting. Oh, sure, they'll begrudgingly allow more transmog, or add a portal, but this is the loot system you're getting, they're right, you're wrong. Your loot experience in the game will be micromanaged by Ion to get the most effective, efficient, meaningless &quot;moment&quot; he can force the engineers to create. <br />
<br />
I personally think this &quot;Gee whillikers, I just don't understand why you're so emotional, we're doing the best we can!&quot; act from Ion isn't working anymore. I bought it a little when he first took over, but it's beyond obvious it's an act to placate the customers. It's all an act. He knows what players like and don't like, he just doesn't have any fucks to give, it's his game now. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensa1</div><div class="date">2019-03-27, 09:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I initially liked world quests when they were first introduced I didn't like the endless grind associated with Artifact Weapons in Legion and was disappointed to see that it was re-introduced as Azerite traits in BFA. Though &quot;improved&quot; somewhat the fact we still have a mission table for the 3rd consecutive expansion boggles my mind as well.<br />
<br />
There are several problems with these systems. As noted by others it's not alt friendly (even with catch up mechanisms) and it, most importantly, never really ends (this makes levelling an Alt even worse). Better reward mechanisms have a greater degree of finality to them then these systems have (and, yes I know every expansion essentially nullifies your work from the prior expansion). <br />
<br />
Add to that other content like Island expeditions and mission tables and this was the first expansion since I started to play in 2005 that I could only bring myself to max level one of my 5 characters and 2 weeks after hitting max level let my sub expire (I played 3 characters in Legion and 5 in every other expansion).<br />
<br />
Part of this is because after 14 years I'm very bored with the game and partly because of all the time-gated, grindy content which has gotten out of hand imho. I will most likely never buy another Expansion if it has these systems.<br />
<br />
That being said I'm actually looking forward to Classic and intend to re-sub when it comes out. While there is, undoubtedly, a lot of grindy content in Classic it's not tied to the essential progression of my character in the way it has been for the last couple of expansions. In other words it's mostly optional and I get to choose whether I want to do it and/or progress my character in that manner. Additionally, there are very finite limits to the various grinds in Classic and the rewards and benefits achieved by the grinding are actually meaningful and can be used / benefited from for extended periods of time (think original legendary weapons). I'll also enjoy the relative straight-forward nature of the Classic game and get to avoid all these grindy systems (mission tables, Azerite, expeditions) built on top of one another that suck the life out of you.</div></div><hr />

But if all I do is the parts of the game I find enjoyable (raiding, mythic+) then I'll get outperformed, at least on paper, by some one who spends 10+ hours a week doing boring, unchallenging, completely unrelated content - which makes raiding and mythic+ less fun for me because I won't ever stay on par with or catch up to some one who does that.</div></div><hr />

Currently, I have 8 120 level characters at 37 or 38 and I do not play them every single day. I stopped doing the islands once I got my required 5 for the war traits. In fact, all I do on each of the characters are the emissaries every three to four days. So if you are, still sitting at 25 or so then you are not even doing the minimum when it comes to doing the emissaries, much less anything other content that provides you with Azerite.</div></div><hr />

IMHO will be stunned if Azerite has a whole isnt just pushed aside and the necks basically become as important as legion weapons.<br />
they can add 10 new rings its just not a patch on the system it replaced. Just a massive shame it took them so long and didnt accept this<br />
when Beta feedback said it wasnt very good :/</div></div><hr />

Since most of the casual player are around 42/44<br />

<br />
u kidding right?????<br />
<br />
my horde alt, that only do emisary and a ramdo quest from Warfront progression is alread at 38, u almost get 1 level for quest till near 40ish<br />
<br />
That's a complete lie. I'm 36 and I do not get 'almost a whole level' for one quest. Maybe at 26. <br />
<br />
If you're 26 or 36, don't even worry about ap. It'll just happen naturally just by playing. Not worth any effort to get the last two traits on gear. You'll replace it first week with better gear once S3 is out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to wowprogress, over 2000 people already have 48, and from now until 8.2, thats a lot of time to catch up on your Azerite.<br />
<br />
Wow the subcount must have dropped very low for 2k to be an impressive number. Are less than a million subbed now?</div></div><hr />

If the claim is &quot;impossible&quot;, then 1 is an amazing and impressive number, because he must've done the impossible!<br />

Did that a week ago. All WQs and exp cap (3xmythic), pvp weekly cap, a few m+ runs and some raid bosses. All in all 3-4h per day at least.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't hurt anything if a heroic raider or below has a piece of two of decently high level gear. The only problem really exists within Mythic as a portion of our community doesn't feel satisfied when a piece of gear doesn't forge instead of treating it like the treat it is when it happens. THey could cap TF at 5 levels below Mythic base for everything else and readjust each tier and then just not allow Mythic gear to forge at all. M+ could still award Mythic level gear. <br />
<br />
I mean a change isn't necessary but if one were to happen that's the one because the TF &quot;issue&quot; is exclusively OUR issue and everyone else shouldn't be punished for it.<br />
<br />
It does hurt other people to have war and titanforging in the game. That's what's driving up item levels between tiers.<br />
<br />
In the last Q&amp;A Ion answered a question about why gear increases so much at the start of the tier, and his answer was basically that a lot of heroic raiders raid a few bosses in mythic so they already have a lot of mythic gear, so the next heroic gear has to go up a lot to be impressive for them.<br />
<br />
That's very clever (and no one will accuse Ion of not being clever) because it obscures the real issue... the problem isn't heroic raiders who do a few mythic bosses, it's that heroic players get so much warforged gear. But Ion knows if he says that he opens the &quot;removing Warforging!&quot; can of worms so he blames it on heroic raiders dipping into mythic.</div></div><hr />

If you grind wqs, do ie's, m+, fill the pvp bar and yadda yadda you'll hit that. It just takes *time*. If you spend an hour a day then yeah, you'll probably not hit it anytime soon(not that it matters because catch-up mechanics in the future). If you've played 6+ hours a day since launch you'd be at 48 by now. You don't have to be a mythic raider to play a lot of wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah it's ridiculous. Literally the one thing that's persisted in the game over all the years has been slowly going away and now even that's been removed. They couldn't even be assed to make 4 outfits and those weapons have been done for ages. There's no excuse, gear to earn is the bare minimum, especially when promised it would have the naga aesthetic. Here we are going up against the last Warcraft 3 lore big bad and they cant even make her drop interesting loot.</div></div><hr />

That's some pretty big guess work on your part. It's also not true. Mythic raiders outgear Heroic raiders. Heroic raiders outgear Normal Raiders, and so on. Nobody is walking around with enough Titanforged gear from lower content to put them above the content they do. The issue isn't Titanforging, it doesn't happen enough to be an issue. <br />
<br />
Things get fuzzy when you factor in M+, that system is designed to be an alternative to raiding and it rewards equivalent gear. It's working as intended but members of the WoW community get confused when they see a very dedicated M+ player in really good gear with a very high item level but maybe he's only done Heroic raiding and instead of being rational they go &quot;FUCKING TITANFORGING OMG!&quot; - <br />
<br />
Ion told us in one of the Q&amp;As near the end of Legion a player raiding normal can expect on average (in an average length tier.) on high level TFed piece of gear. It doesn't happen frequently enough that people are running around in full or even half sets of Mythic gear from lower content that's TFed. That's a complete myth and this community needs to stop perpetuating that.</div></div><hr />

You have not convinced me that the subcount must be ridiculously low for that to be a &quot;high&quot; number.</div></div><hr />

Its not meant to be a &quot;high&quot; number. Its just meant to counter claims of it being impossible to max the heart. Clearly a decent number of people have managed to do so now already, with many more weeks to go before new content arrives (ie. plenty time for everyone to catch up).<br />
<br />
You are the people that brought sub numbers into this. But feel free to join the &quot;wow is dying&quot; circle jerk next door.</div></div><hr />
