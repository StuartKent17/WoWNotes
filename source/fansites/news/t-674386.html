The latest PTR build introduced a few quests related to Shadowmourne, the Legendary Axe you will get in the Icecrown Citadel.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/october/shadowsedge10596_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/october/shadowsedge10596.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/october/shadowmourne10596_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/october/shadowmourne10596.jpg)<br />
<br />
Actually, you probably won't get Shadowmourne. You will most likely acquire a downgraded version of the axe called Shadow's Edge and will have to upgrade it by completing multiple quests in the Citadel, most of them require you to kill a boss or a given amount of monsters in the instance. <br />
<br />
Below you will find a list of the quests related to Shadowmourne / Shadow's Edge. Please note that some of them like The Final Descent (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24748/the-final-descent/) or Shadowmourne, Blade of Legends (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24549/shadowmourne-blade-of-legends/) aren't available on PTRs for the moment and any of these quests could change anyway. <br />
<br />
The Sacred and the Corrupt (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24545/the-sacred-and-the-corrupt/)<br />
It is against my judgment that I present you this errand, &lt;race&gt;, as it will likely end in your undoing. Ignore my counsel and embark on the endeavor, and I shall provide you with the knowledge and resources to see it through.<br />
<br />
You must return to Frostmourne Cavern and recover Light's Vengeance, Arthas' discarded hammer. Reforged with saronite and etched with the acidic blood of the Lich King's abominations, it will provide the foundation for our work. <br />
<br />
Unholy Infusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24749/unholy-infusion/)<br />
Before your weapon can reach its full potential it must be endowed with its signature powers. First among them is unholiness. You must seek out and defeat the one called Professor Putricide, but his death is not your only goal. You must use his resources against him.<br />
<br />
Find a way to absorb his mutated slime. Use the foul substance to infuse your weapon with the power of the unholy. Only when this has been done shall I reveal your next task. <br />
<br />
Blood Infusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24756/blood-infusion/)<br />
Your weapon is now prepared to be endowed with the power of blood. You are to face Queen Lana'thel in battle and bathe the axe in her Blood Mirror power. When it has been fully infused, you must slay her unmercifully.<br />
<br />
May her screams pierce the ears of the Lich King as he awaits his fate. <br />
<br />
Frost Infusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24757/frost-infusion/)<br />
Shadow's Edge is prepared to receive its final infusion of power. Sindragosa, the enemy's own mount, must fall. But before she is brought down, you must sustain three of her frozen breath attacks without tasting death. <br />
<br />
Without his dragon, nothing shall stand between you and the Lich King. <br />
<br />
The Splintered Throne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24548/the-splintered-throne/)<br />
The Lich King's throne once served as his prison. Kil'jaeden himself crafted the vessel of icy crystals from the twisting nether. Its sole purpose was to hold Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit. When Arthas struck the crystal with Frostmourne, he released Ner'zhul's soul, allowing it to merge with with his own. Splinters from that impact are now scattered throughout the citadel.<br />
<br />
I shall require those shards, held only by the Lich King's most powerful servants, to seal the power contained in your blade. <br />
<br />
A Feast of Souls (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24547/a-feast-of-souls/)<br />
Shadow's Edge is among the greatest weapons a &lt;class&gt; could hope to obtain. Is your lust for power sated, &lt;race&gt;? &lt;You feel Mograine's penetrating gaze.&gt;<br />
<br />
I thought not. A final warning then... You now embark on the most treacherous leg of your quest. Bridle your aspirations, for if your aims are impure then your life, your very soul, is forfeit.<br />
<br />
The weapon you hold is but an empty husk, a mere shadow of what it may become. Only the devouring of a thousand souls will unlock its true potential. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hallow's End Achievement Issue<br />
We are currently experiencing an issue with the Hallow's End candy buckets that is affecting the Trick or Treat Achievements for this event. Certain candy buckets in Northrend, once looted, are preventing characters from looting some of the Candy Buckets required for the Trick or Treats of Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor and Outlands. The current way to work around this is to get the candy buckets from Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, and Outland before doing any in Northrend.<br />
<br />
Note, doing the Achievements first will prevent some of the Northrend Candy Buckets from being intractable.<br />
<br />
We are actively working on a resolution for this and will provide more information when it is available.<br />
<br />
Update: At this time please do not submit an in-game ticket on this issue, doing so will not result in a faster resolution as we are still working on the issue and will provide more information when it is available. Thank you. <br />

And the fact that it's evidently a reforging of Arthas' hammer means it's not even a previously-unknown weapon of lore, like many were QQing about with Val'anyr. Combines the shard-gathering of Atiesh, with the boss-wrangling of other legendaries, several times, over, PLUS the mini-grind of killing buttloads of Scourge. Pretty epic.</div></div><hr />

Hahaha that would be sweet. It'll probably just be 'kill a thousand enemies in Icecrown (zone) or Icecrown Citidal-raid/instances though.</div></div><hr />

More likely, it'll be infusing it with Frostmourne. Seeing as that's done the thousand souls for us.</div></div><hr />

This is WotLK. Blacksmith's will make it out of 10 saronite and a frozen orb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm noticing it doesn't say kill the bosses on hard mode so although i have no doubt it will be... wait for it...legendary. It won't be +1 tier legendary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol<br />
<br />
I'm really wondering how rare it will be though. First you need the base one, which is probably the most time consuming to get. I'd love to have it, but I'd bet GMs and Officers in guild will be the only ones to get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the quest starts with getting Arthas old hammer and some &quot;runeforged saronite&quot; (or something like that). Read nothing with the base item to start with. Or is this only on PTR?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless the quest has some text saying (must be completed in hard mode). I just don't see a legendary being created from normal modes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he meant the opening quest to get Shadow's Edge; hard to tell how difficult getting Primordial Saronite will be. I wouldn't be surprised if it's a BS item that is both an Icecrown-recipe drop combined with whatever Orb-equivalent there is in Icecrown, maybe even as crazy as one-per-bar. That would be sweet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selkinor</div><div class="date">2009-10-19, 08:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, I think it requires hard modes. Three frost breaths from Sindragosa, that sounds like a qualification a hard mode might have. I'm sure they wouldn't give this away to anyone, because let's face it, A LOT of guilds can down normal ICC. If the legendary required 3 or 4 hard modes, it would be worth the long grind and be pretty &quot;Legendary&quot;, like many people have been asking for. I, personally, am excited about this, but my main doesn't use 2H axes. :(</div></div><hr />

That is.. Interesting. I like it.<br />
<br />
Primordial saronite, I'm guessing this will be like the fragments of val'akir.<br />

DLC seems overloaded again.</div></div><hr />

Frost breaths are like...standard from frost dragons. The chances of that being hard mode only are slim.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sephkka</div><div class="date">2009-10-19, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So... looks like a hard mode boss to get the base item, along with the farming of some mats, both simple (Saronite?), and possibly other rare drops (Abomination Blood?)<br />
<br />
Then, 3 specific other hard modes in a specific order, possibly with additional quest only objectives (not part of normal hard mode) <br />
<br />
1 Unholy -- Prof. Putricide<br />
2 Blood -- Queen Lana'thel<br />
3 Frost -- Sindragosa (keep in mind you will have to take damage from the breaths personally, so possibly require a tank offspec at one point? Lol, another shot at any people bitching about hunters or shamans being able to get them..)<br />
<br />
Then, shard gathering! Possibly similar to Val'anyr fragments..?<br />
<br />
If so, do they not drop at all unless one person in the raid has currently already completed the first four steps?<br />
<br />
So that gets you Shadow's Edge, then still 2 more untapped quests after that for Shadowmourne..<br />
<br />
This is going to be pretty damn awesome guys.. I'm just really curious if it will be very heavy on stam to where it would also be BiS for DK tanks as well as DPS.. obviously for Threat I'm sure it would be, but if there are other options that would be better for avoidance/health I will be glad.. because if this is a DPS get it first type senario, I might be 2nd in line for it in my guild &gt;.&lt; <br />
<br />
Also, I just thought.. could multiple people start this quest before completeing it? Whereas with Val'anyr it was pretty much one at a time because it started with the shards, rather than finishing with them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saberoy</div><div class="date">2009-10-19, 09:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like some good ol' fashioned Legendary weapon making. Go to this, this, and this, now you have a weak weapon, now do this, this, and this, and once more, the big test and Wha bam, you got yourself a big ol Frostmournesque axe. I likes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So, reforging Arthas's hammer ?<br />
<br />
Only one Shadowmourne per realm, please please please ?<br />
<br />
Make Legendary really legendary !<br />
<br />
<br />
Wait wat? I have seen like 2-3 Val'anyrs running around on my server. Furthermore, why do you really want this? Are you going to be the only person on your server to get this? And if your guild is really that good... do you really want to not have a chance to make another if someone else is chosen over you?</div></div><hr />

Yeah right.<br />
<br />
1) get legendary<br />
2) sell account on ebay<br />
3) ?<br />
4) profit<br />
<br />
bound to happen!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if there'll be a class restriction? I mean, shamans and hunters can use two-handed axes, but it'd be pretty stupid if they could use this weapon.<br />
<br />
It should be Paladin - Deathknight - Warrior only amirite?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah right.<br />
<br />
1) get legendary<br />

The 1000 soul thing sounds easy. Kill Arthas! How many souls has frostmourn taken? I'm sure its over 1000! Maybe even.... OVER 2000!!!! :3</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also wonder if the initial quest is still an absolute pain in the butt to do and how it certainly requires a group.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, actually the tooltip specifies - kill 1000 mobs in ICC using Shadow's Edge.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it'd be interesting if the Shadow's Edge weapon was like the Cursed Shield in Final Fantasy VI. Although, it couldn't be exactly like that shield (since it put every status ailment in the game, including a death countdown, on the wielding character), but I think it'd be more fun :P.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3 Frost -- Sindragosa (keep in mind you will have to take damage from the breaths personally, so possibly require a tank offspec at one point? Lol, another shot at any people bitching about hunters or shamans being able to get them..)<br />
<br />
Or just use Guardian Spirit so you don't die to the breath attack... and you just eat them when they come?</div></div><hr />

There IS only ONE &quot;Light's Vengeance&quot; which was Arthas' hammer before he dropped it for Frostmourne.<br />

This means there being more than 1 Shadowmourne kinda bends the lore a lot, but you have to for gameplay sometimes, it's been done plenty of times before.<br />

That... seems rather easy. Well, I suppose they could stretch it out in the &quot;shards of the Frozen throne&quot; leg of it. Maybe you'll need like 30 and it drops one per boss, or not even.</div></div><hr />

These people have never tried dedicated insanity I would bet, 10 mans are not the faceroll they think they are when you do them properly...Just make the quest item drop from killing arthas without wearing any 25 man gear and/or not wiping and that's fair.</div></div><hr />

Plus the quest text makes it seem like you're &quot;supposed&quot; to get it before you even get near Arthas. So why would it say &quot;and let her screams be heard by Arthas&quot; if you had to kill him to get the weapon itself?</div></div><hr />

Why do people say dumbshit such as this, what if after a boss is looted once they can never drop that item again so thre wil never be more than one item per server for everything. MMOs are made with YOU being the hero no one else exists on the server or are as important as you since you are the Hero.</div></div><hr />

The problem with legendary in 10man is that, every 25man guild will be capable of obtaining the 10man legendary and make it not so &quot;legendary&quot;. <br />

Well duh. If they are going to let players use a weapon, Blizzard will break as much lore as they want. Obviously multiple people are going to have Shadow's Edge and working on the 1000 kill count.</div></div><hr />

It seems like they (the NPCs) are saying &quot;Take this most blessed of weapons, dip it in some putrid slime, some blood, get an undead dragon to breath on it, and then kill 1000 souls&quot;. It just seems wrong. I'd much prefer it if it went something along the lines of &quot;take this weapon, use it to break up the labs of the slime guy, the sacrificial alter of some blood priestess, and then send 1000 souls in ICC onwards to the light&quot;. Roughly the same quest ideas, but less of a &quot;corrupt this blessed weapon&quot; idea.</div></div><hr />

I would like you to find Arthas' Hammer, a weapon of the light.<br />
Then I want you to corrupt it with the powers the Lich King bestowed upon the Death Knights.<br />
What? Yes I know what I'm talking about, I'm sure it wont damage you as a person.<br />
So, yes, after you have corrupted this Holy weapon I want you to murder 1000 innocents with it and let the edge consume their souls.<br />
Hmm, your right, it does sound a lot like Frostmourn. I doubt it will have any other similarities. Yes, of course it is safe.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The Splintered Throne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24548/the-splintered-throne/)<br />
The Lich King's throne once served as his prison. Kil'jaeden himself crafted the vessel of icy crystals from the twisting nether. Its sole purpose was to hold Ner'zhul's vengeful spirit. When Arthas struck the crystal with Frostmourne, he released Ner'zhul's soul, allowing it to merge with with his own. Splinters from that impact are now scattered throughout the citadel.<br />
<br />
I shall require those shards, held only by the Lich King's most powerful servants, to seal the power contained in your blade. <br />
<br />
And read the quest :<br />
<br />
<br />
The Splintered Throne<br />
Hilghlord Darion Mograine wants you to collect 45 Shadowfrost Shards.<br />
<br />
So you do the whole chain to get the right to start farming for a Val'anyr #2 with 45 shards that might be as rare as Val'anyr shards.<br />
<br />
The chain in itself doesn't seem extremely hard but there will be 2 bottlenecks :<br />
- the starting item (how does it start ? how common is the item ?)<br />
- the shards</div></div><hr />

1) Arthas Most Powerful Death Knight drops the Shadow's Edge (his weapon)<br />
2) You need to to the quests (and complete the instance)<br />
3) Those shards/kill minions can be completed in either 10/25 mans<br />
4) Shadow's Edge/Boss Kills are 25 man only.<br />
<br />
This is because: Legendary items should be 25 man only. Shards/Kills needs to be farmed tho so 10 man is viable.</div></div><hr />

I, personally, am excited about this, but my main doesn't use 2H axes. :(<br />
<br />
<br />
This ITEM will NOT require hard modes and the reason for that is because you underestimate the power of people to be pissed when a system is truly unfair. Seeing the last legendary did not require hard modes there is no chance this one is going too. Especially when this already requires more work than the last one did.

It just seems wrong. I'd much prefer it if it went something along the lines of &quot;take this weapon, use it to break up the labs of the slime guy, the sacrificial alter of some blood priestess, and then send 1000 souls in ICC onwards to the light&quot;. Roughly the same quest ideas, but less of a &quot;corrupt this blessed weapon&quot; idea.<br />

<br />
<br />
Um... no. 10 man is primary designed for raids that cannot get 25 good players in a raid. Blizzard is not about farming raids, they want to give appropriate challenges to as many end content guilds as possible. You are encouraged to do 25 man if you can get the players for it, 10 man if you cannot. You can do 10 man and 25 man if you have the time, but many guilds only raid 5 hours a week. To put shards in 10 man version would simply be taunting those 10 man only raids, while taunting those players that have completely out geared 10 man, and would only run it for a single player needed those shards (I'm sure some guilds are like that with Ulduar 25 right now though).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've raided whole content from vanilla to wotlk. I even got thunderfury on my warrior when it mattered, on lvl 60. <br />
The only hard thing about 25 mans now is getting enough people, skill and execution wise some fights are even harder, take the champions for an example.<br />

<br />
Forget hunters. If you have to deal the killing blow, that's going to be insane. Trash will take forever if we have to stop DPS early to let someone solo it down. I hope it's just &quot;hit the mob with the weapon&quot;. 1000 isn't so bad when you figure you go through 100+ trash mobs per raid, and it doesn't say &quot;25-man only&quot; for that part. So if you full-clear 10-man and 25-man, you'd have that in a few weeks.<br />
<br />
And 45 shards may be a placeholder. Val'anyr was originally 40 on the PTR to keep PTR raiders from assembling it. And drop rate matters too.</div></div><hr />

wat. What do you want then? It's a massive epic quest chain with a lot of interesting elements involving the ICC bosses (though bathing the weapon in dragon breath has been done before &lt;- see Onyxia). <br />

<br />
Looking forward to 4 warriors all wanting to stand in the frost breath 3 times. Healer nightmare<br />

<br />
You start the quest from Mograine, you get &quot;Light's Vengeance,&quot; Probably as an &quot;item&quot; not a weapon. (although in the video linked above it looks epic quality, so it might be a weapon). <br />
<br />
You then recover the Primordial Saronite, which most likely requires farming in Icecrown. (assuming it's the equivalent of Crusader orbs etc). <br />
<br />
You turn in the primordial Saronite and the Lights' Vengeance, along with the acid to Mograine. He gives you a new item, possibly a weapon. Then gives you a quest or a series of quests to go and do things in icecrown. My money is on one or more of these requiring &quot;medium hard&quot; modes like getting Val'anyr required doing Medium Iron Council and Yogg+3. It looks like 3/4 require single boss kills, and the last requires Atiesh/ Val'aynr like shard farming. If it's 45 shards my guess is the drop rate will be a bit higher than the Val'Anyr shards in Uldar. But either way, 3-4 weeks at a minimum, probably more like 6-8. <br />
<br />
You complete those three and you get a usable weapon, shadows edge, which is an Icecrown level 2h Epic Axe. Blizzard has said before that the &quot;legendary&quot; part of legendary weapons is not their stats, but their &quot;special&quot; <br />
<br />
THen you get the final quest to infuse it with the souls. YOu complete that, and you unlock whatever &quot;legedary power&quot; that the weapon has, and it (possibly) becomes more powerful, and more importantly, gains whatever &quot;legendary&quot; special ability it has.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I realized that just as I hit submit. <br />
<br />
As for the last two, I forgot about those, but if I had to guess, they're at the end of the chain. &quot;the Final Descent&quot; is something you must do after you've &quot;harvested&quot; the 1000 souls, and &quot;Shadowmourne: blade of legends&quot; is just a placeholder quest to go pick up the weapon.</div></div><hr />

The past legendaries weren't so legendary, as they were nothing more than drops off bosses (Yogg-Saron of course being different). 25-man raids are jokes now, so there's no way that weapon should just be a simple drop, it should be one long questline that forces you to be a member of a raid, not just some random PuG.<br />

Just saying. Feel free to correct me if I missed anything that said they decided it wouldn't be Hunter/DK only. IMO Hunter/DK only DPS makes since because I've seen a lot of Hunters and DPS DKs use the same weapons (armrpen, ap, agi, stam, crit). As a Hunter I would love for it to be Hunter/DK only, but if they increase the bridge taking it to other classes as well. Though if they put STR on it then it will be completely useless to hunters, therefore making it Pally/War/DK. And possibly Shams, but most shams I know use DW or MH/Shield.

Assuming it's a strength based weapon and not agil/ap like Betrayer was, that's really only the classes that make sense. <br />

If you follow the quest text we have now:<br />
<br />
<br />
A Feast of Souls<br />
Highlord Darion Mograine wants you to use Shadow's Edge to slay 1000 of the Lich King's minions in Icecrown Citadel.<br />
<br />
Hunters would have a hard time doing this if that text is taken at face value, unless the raid is ok with them going melee for a few runs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JimmyKane</div><div class="date">2009-10-19, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I highly doubt you hitting the enemy with Shadows Edge would be any factor at all. You are just reading too much into the quest text. If it was agi/ap therefore hunter useable then you actually &quot;slaying&quot; the mob using the axe would definitely not mean killing it phisically using the axe, because hunters are never supposed to melee with the exception of the mongoose/raptor strike/wing clip bam here's your frost trap now I'm gonna run away and kill you with my bow like blizzard intended. And I don't remember where but someone had asked if hunter melee would become better in the future but as I remember blizzards answer was a definite hell no since we are supposed to be bow weilding bad asses.<br />
<br />
Anyways, back on topic; If it's not hunter viable then the issue of melee doesn't exist, because DKs/Ret only melee.<br />
<br />
Bassically point is if it's meant for hunters to use at all then they won't have to use melee. Blizzard wouldn't be stupid like that. And if they did do something that stupid rest assured every hunter would bitch till 3.3.1 when blizz fixes that issue.</div></div><hr />

IMO Hunter/DK only DPS makes since because I've seen a lot of Hunters and DPS DKs use the same weapons (armrpen, ap, agi, stam, crit). As a Hunter I would love for it to be Hunter/DK only, but if they increase the bridge taking it to other classes as well. Though if they put STR on it then it will be completely useless to hunters, therefore making it Pally/War/DK. And possibly Shams, but most shams I know use DW or MH/Shield. Rarely ever see a 2h sham anymore.<br />
<br />
Anyone who was actually there or watched the live stream saw that the &quot;Obviously a hunter weapon&quot; comment was a joke, one witch all the long time WoW player nerds (like myself) who paid big bucks to fly out to the west coast to attend a video game convention found hillarious.<br />
<br />
That said, however, it is unlikely that Bliz will put a class restriction on it since they have yet to do that with almost any legendary (Atish didn't include shamans but at the time it was shaman / paly split and giving shaman's the ability to use it would have upset the make believe alliance / horde balance in PvE). So pretty much anyone (yes even mages / locks / boomkins ect) can work on the quest and forge the blade assuming you're in a guild doing the content and they are willing to give you the shards / abomination blood / pure saronite or what ever to forge it. Bliz leaves legendaries to the discretion of the guilds that make them if they want to give hand of rag to a druid, glaives to a hunter, or the bow to a rogue; they earned the legendary its up to them to choose how to use it.</div></div><hr />

It was stated in a blue post shortly after Blizzcon that there won't be any class restrictions on it. Hunters just don't have much use for Str item (which it will be as a Plate melee weapon), however.</div></div><hr />

This means there being more than 1 Shadowmourne kinda bends the lore a lot, but you have to for gameplay sometimes, it's been done plenty of times before.<br />

As cool as it WOULD be for there to be only 1 Shadowmourne because of lore, it would be equally uncool.<br />

only 1 guild can kill arthas<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LavaDuck</div><div class="date">2009-10-20, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">From reading teh descriptiosn seems to me that this is how the item will progress. I have yet to try starting it on the PTR. <br />
<br />
You start the quest from Mograine, you get &quot;Light's Vengeance,&quot; Probably as an &quot;item&quot; not a weapon. (although in the video linked above it looks epic quality, so it might be a weapon). <br />
<br />
You then recover the Primordial Saronite, which most likely requires farming in Icecrown. (assuming it's the equivalent of Crusader orbs etc). <br />
<br />
You turn in the primordial Saronite and the Lights' Vengeance, along with the acid to Mograine. He gives you a new item, possibly a weapon. Then gives you a quest or a series of quests to go and do things in icecrown. My money is on one or more of these requiring &quot;medium hard&quot; modes like getting Val'anyr required doing Medium Iron Council and Yogg+3. It looks like 3/4 require single boss kills, and the last requires Atiesh/ Val'aynr like shard farming. If it's 45 shards my guess is the drop rate will be a bit higher than the Val'Anyr shards in Uldar. But either way, 3-4 weeks at a minimum, probably more like 6-8. <br />
<br />
You complete those three and you get a usable weapon, shadows edge, which is an Icecrown level 2h Epic Axe. Blizzard has said before that the &quot;legendary&quot; part of legendary weapons is not their stats, but their &quot;special&quot; <br />
<br />
THen you get the final quest to infuse it with the souls. YOu complete that, and you unlock whatever &quot;legedary power&quot; that the weapon has, and it (possibly) becomes more powerful, and more importantly, gains whatever &quot;legendary&quot; special ability it has. <br />

How did we reforge all those splinters we found in naxx 40 into a useable weapon? lots of sellotape and super glue?<br />

This would be: <br />
1. Rather cool<br />
2. The way to make the weapon actually THE legendary i.e. blueish flaming<br />
3. A way to make sure, that the world firstkill on heroic mode maybe won't go to the so called &quot;top guilds&quot; out there, if they don't have a lucky hand with the shards</div></div><hr />

Cmon now blizzard please at least have SOME common sense. <br />
<br />
This weapon should be constructed through the power of purity and the light, the only thing that can defeat the whole scourge and its undead, death knight leader. Instead of we have quests of stealing souls, collecting blood, lust for power, the very things that tore Arthas down. I thought the goal was to DEFEAT this type of power not BECOME it. <br />

This is something i totaly DISAGREE on. what your saying is things that is ruining the game why? you want everything so god damn easy.. and not even prove that you &quot;deserve&quot; the item.. it seems like if you could have ur wish then you whould get lengendary's thro group quests. imo the legendary should ONLY be obtainable afther killing Arthas 25 man hardmode. period</div></div><hr />

Tomt I agree with you 100% my guild only runs 10man normal and Hard we are not that big. On my server trying to pug a 25 man raid is fail most of the time. Now im not saying let a 10 man normal get it but let a 10man heroic get. Quoting Daneel (10 man heroic? If anything, its harder then 25.)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MystNL</div><div class="date">2009-11-19, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't agree. Before WOTLK it was raiding as it should be. Karazhan and ZA were the only raids for 10 man guilds, If you wanted more gear and end game stuff you needed to be in a 25 man guild which were above average to do BT and SW. <br />
<br />
Further of all Blizz messed everything up giving noobs who has never raided before the oppurtunity to get 25 man gear easily. It's not hard to get T9 and for example my warrior who just turned 80 already has good gear enough to start ToGC. I have the experience, but you can imagine that other people who just turned 80 think they have the gear and go start ToGC but screw up due to lack of knowledge. <br />
<br />
And btw no offense but vanilla had 40 man raids! So I don't think 10 man will have the same rights that 25 man. Simply because 10 man are also much more easier than 25 man raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cerbul</div><div class="date">2009-11-19, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's face it, exactly the way many guilds (unfortunately mine also) make its way into Ulduar 25 hard modes and Algalon 25 with Totc gear, the same way in 10 man hard modes 10 out of 10 ppl have at least one item which is of a higher Ilevel. <br />
So, whatever way you take it, there is no way to &quot;force&quot; ppl to do hard modes with a set of gear that is the maximum ilevel of that particular instance, jsut for the fact that most ppl shard/sell old gear, and don't bother to keep a set of older gear minmaxed the way is needed, for 10 man hc only. 25 ppl have it from the start the fair way, just for the fact that there is no other higher ilevel gear ingame, so they are forced to do it witht he gear they get from that instance. <br />
<br />
I personally like much more 10 ppl instances jsut for the fact that if I die as healer in 25 ppl will be less of an impact than it is on 10 ppl, which makes every player much more important overall in 10 ppl. But those hard modes unfortunately are usualy done with gear with higher ilevel, so is not fair to put a Shadowmorne in there, unless Blizz finds a way to force ppl not wear higher ilevel.<br />
<br />
So stop it with remarks like 10 man is easyer or anything like that, cause is not true. They both have their advantages/disadvantages. here is a lsit of things:<br />
<br />
1. 10 Man <br />
<br />
easyer because<br />
- you can always use higher ilevel<br />
- the encounter is learned much faster cause fewer things happens<br />
- leader can control it much more easy<br />
<br />
harder because<br />
- if one player dies is usualy a wipe<br />
- every player becomes much more important and every single one of them must perform imba<br />
- blizz makes them actualy harder to compensate for the ppl that will anyway use items from badges/25 ppl version of that instance,<br />
<br />
2. 25 ppl raids:<br />
<br />
easyer because:<br />
- there always are some players taht can underperform and be carryed through it<br />
- even if some die, there are alot of locks/druids to make up for it, and you can actualy do it with 3 4 ppl death. <br />
- healing is easyer cause there is always someone to ehal your target, unless you spend alot of time assigning healers perfectly.<br />
<br />
harder because:<br />
- blizz can tune it based on the assumption that the highest ilevel players will get is the one from that poarticular instance<br />
- more things will happen around you, more tanks will be used, more jobs to assign, leaders will have much more things to take care of, and this will result in an overall much harder to control reason.<br />
<br />
So, see my point? In the other hand tell me how many guilds will do a 10 ppl instance with items from that instance only, actually keeping a set only for that.. (we know already that verry few guilds (if any) did that achievement that is based on ilevel, don;t remember now but was on yog 10 ppl to kill it with ilevel 219 gear)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So anyway i definatly agree with his post. 10man Heroic isn't by default harder or Easier then 25man heroic. For the reasons that Cerbul listed in combination with the type of encounter it's either harder or easier but it can be different for each boss. For example months ago Sartharion 3D was harder for 10man's while Anub heroic turns out to be harder for 25mans then 10man.<br />
<br />
But the fact is that there's only one version of shadowmourne so that seems to point out that it will only be available on 25man heroics. It's likely that blizzard don't want people to get the axe using 25man gear on a 10man heroic.</div></div><hr />

Think about it, something that can wield that much damage and quickly by the look of the speed, will wipe out anything that player faces. <br />
<br />
I suggest, that weapon has to be used on the Lich King first, then once it is used on him it reverts to something like an above average epic (still maintaining legendary status) so the player doesn't have an unfair advantage. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, the player should be rewarded for achieveing the weapon, and it should have great stats.<br />

To much lore in one weapon! Same with Arthas, he is way to important for the warcraft lore to be killed already! Arthas will be a part of the lore from the beginning... good or evil... till the end..! (A) :)</div></div><hr />

Is this quest started from a drop in ICC? or do you just pick up the quest from an NPC and go from there?</div></div><hr />
