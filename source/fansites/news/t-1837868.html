<br />
Demon Hunters<br />
<br />
Demon Hunters will start somewhere around level 95 to 100.<br />
Glavies are a new type of weapon that Demon Hunters use. They are a pair that comes together and fills both slots. In the future, Demon Hunters might dual wield the standard agility weapons. (Currently the class page (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/class/demon-hunter) has different information)<br />
The Demon Hunter Artifact glaives can be see in some of the character creation screenshots for Demon Hunters.<br />
The team talked about having the Demon Hunter wear mail, but it didn't fit the class identity. <br />
Demon Hunters are agile, so they will be wearing leather. This isn't a huge problem now that Personal Loot is used in most places.<br />
The Demon Hunter is going to be a very agile class, so tanks may have lots of Dodge and Parry mechanics for their tanking style.<br />
For now, Demon Hunters are the only ones who get tattoos. <br />
Demon Hunter has been considered since Wrath of the Lich King. It finally fit the expansion's story and theme, which is why it can be added now.<br />
In order to fight demons, Illidan had to partner with demons. He had to sacrifice many things for great power and so do the Illidari, which is why Demon Hunters look somewhat like Illidan. <br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
No stat squish is planned for this expansion.<br />
The team hasn't decided if there will be another talent row or not, as the Artifact weapon will have a decent number of choices for you to make.<br />
Survival Hunters will be a melee class with pet going forward. <br />
Beast Mastery Hunters will fight at range with a pet.<br />
Marksmanship Hunters will fight at range with no pet.<br />
Survival and Marksmanship have been too similar in the past, which is why they are being changed in Legion. <br />
Demonology Warlocks will also be getting some bigger changes, focusing more on their demons. <br />
Demonology Warlocks will be refocused on summoning and controlling demons rather than having Metamorphosis dominate. Other specs will still have access to demons.<br />
Discipline Priests <br />
<br />
Disc Priests are going to be a much more offensive healer after another pass on Atonement which will make it more interactive. <br />
They will still have heals and PW:S, but they will sustain their healing through doing DPS. <br />
Closer to 50% damage and 50% healing spec. <br />
In the past, when Atonement was popular you would just spam Smite and Holy Fire all fight long and use the smart healing, which wasn't very interactive. This time, you may throw out some single target heals giving players a buff. Next time you Smite, people who have that buff will get your healing, and you will have to refresh the buff periodically. <br />
These changes should fix the absorb heavy nature of Discipline Priests. <br />
<br />
Holy Priests will still be all about healing.<br />
The team has learned some lessons from how Fistweaving works now and will talk about what they are doing to solve the problems with it in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
<br />
The team isn't sure how exactly they will incentivize players to keep going back to dungeons yet. Once you started to raid in Draenor, you had no reason to go back to a dungeon, which is not good. Mists of Pandaria was a better model, where you had a reward for doing a dungeon every day.<br />
Normal and Heroic dungeons will exist in Legion, but the team isn't sure if they will do Mythic at the start. They haven't decided when they will add Mythic, but they do like it.<br />
The team likes challenge modes and wants to try and make them more accessible. They aren't guaranteed to be added to Legion. <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifacts and Items<br />
<br />
You will not loot weapons in Legion.<br />
The item bonus system (Warforged, sockets, and extra stats) worked out well, so it could be extended to have even more bonuses.<br />
The team has a few ideas for how artifacts will work:<br />
<br />
Your Artifact will start at epic and then there will be some way for it to become legendary over time.<br />
Your Artifact will start as legendary.<br />
Your artifact may not have a quality, it could just be its own thing.<br />
The goal is for players to have an item that they are working on powering up and it can become a legendary, rewarding players who do all of the expansion's content, similar to Mists of Pandaria and Warlords.<br />
<br />
There will be no catch up mechanics for Artifact weapons on alts.<br />
The team doesn't want it to be too painful if you want to change specs, so there might be some kind of catch up mechanic for getting the Artifact weapon for another spec. <br />
How we actually get the Artifact weapons from the characters currently wielding them will be revealed in the future.<br />
Eventually you will be able to unlock every trait in the Artifact weapon tree. You may be able to take different paths to unlocking them all though.<br />
You will be leveling the Artifact weapon throughout the entire expansion.<br />
The Artifact weapons have Relic slots, which will determine its raw item stats (DPS, ilvl, etc.) and modifiers to the traits you've chosen, so the Artifact's stats will still improve as you defeat bosses.<br />
Relics are things you can socket into the artifact and are rewarded from completing major quest lines, dungeons, and raids. This way you still get weapon upgrades from the same sources, but keep the same weapon.<br />
Artifact weapons can be transmoged into other weapons, but not the other way around.<br />
There are weapons cooler than Benediction and Anathema for Priest Artifact weapons.<br />
Earning the Artifact has a class and spec specific quest, but it isn't anywhere near the green fire quest in terms of scale and difficulty. <br />
<br />
<br />
Raids<br />
<br />
Raids today are harder than they have ever been.<br />
Raids worked out well for the most part in Warlords, but the team has talked about how to make loot better and how to improve personal loot for Legion.<br />
Having some encounters that favor melee and some that favor ranged is not a problem, as long as there isn't a huge gap between the two.<br />
On rumors that Sylvanas might be a raid boss: &quot;That's interesting&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Order Halls<br />
<br />
Order Halls won't have an auction house or bank.<br />
You will spend less time in your Order Hall than you did in your Garrison. You go back to do quests, work on your artifact, and interact with your champions. You will likely spend a lot of your downtime in Dalaran. <br />
The Dalaran Sewers were mentioned as being associated with rogues when providing context for an Order Hall question.<br />
The Order Halls may have different sections. For example, in the Paladin's Order Hall, the Blood Elf Paladins may be in a different section from The Sunwalkers, as well as the Humans and Dwarves. <br />
The fantasy in Draenor was collecting followers to raise an army. In Legion, you are the leader of your class order and you have a smaller number of elite heroes by your side. They should complement and enhance your gameplay rather than compete with you.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
The Conquest system is going away.<br />
The goals is to remove PvP gear. There will be PvP ways to obtain gear, but the power in PvP will be about the gear you obtain and the PvP talents that you unlock. <br />
<br />
<br />
World<br />
<br />
The location of the Broken Isles will be revealed in the future.<br />
The team isn't sure how they will handle Dalaran yet. They could do sanctuary areas again or split it up.<br />
Only the raid takes place in the Emerald Nightmare, but it could be expanded on in the future.<br />
Karazhan is an important place.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flying<br />
<br />
The team is happy with how flying worked out in Draenor. You will have to level up and explore the land before you are able to fly, similar to what is coming in Patch 6.2.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
Future<br />
<br />
The team still wants to release expansions faster.<br />
Legion will release next year, but no specific date has been set yet.<br />
There isn't a solid patch schedule plan for Legion yet. <br />
The expansion after Legion is already being planned.<br />
The cinematic isn't complete just yet.<br />
The transmog overhaul should make it easier to use. You should be able to browse through what you have unlocked and what you could unlock for each slot, more like a dressing room than the current system.<br />
As far as the listed social improvements go, the team has ideas on how to bring different servers together, different ways to connect to your friends, and on how to match-make friends better. Keep in mind that these are just ideas at this point.<br />
The team strongly believes that WoW is best played with friends. It is the most fun when you can make connections with other players in game or bring in friends from outside the game and play together.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
The professions team for Legion is the largest that Blizzard has ever had for WoW and lots of new things are coming. The team heard the feedback about Warlords professions.<br />
There are a lot of surprises in store for players in Legion and the team doesn't want players to think we are just going back to the same stuff.<br />
Patch 6.1 was not named correctly and they could have done better.<br />
Garrisons are staying in Draenor, so you can go back and visit them if you want.<br />
The subscriber count is more volatile than it used to be because players have gotten older and don't have as much free time anymore. As long as players are happy and enjoy the game, the team doesn't mind extreme peaks and valleys. They just want to ensure you have a great experience and feel like you got your money's worth. <br />
The team doesn't focus on or make decisions based on what their subscriber count is. They focus on making the best game they can, learn some lessons, and keep moving forward.<br />
Focusing an expansion on new places and characters, such as Mists of Pandaria is not a mistake. It was a nice break from having one big bad guy, with a focus on exploration and adventure. <br />

Burning Crusade Remake<br />
Blizz. Love you guys, Love your games. I have since Orcs. But.... A reboot? Burning Crusade II? Come on guys.<br />
I'm not sure how it's a reboot unless you've managed to go to the Broken Isles before or seen Aszhara before etc. <br />
<br />
As for the Legion – we always knew they could make a return – and boy are they going to make a return...<br />
<br />
OP is Troll. please delete thread and move on.<br />
Perhaps, or perhaps not. I've seen more than one person make this sort of claim/statement, and it bears a rebuttal even if to just put it out there. <br />
<br />
I am not trying to be ugly here or anything of the sort but I have to ask you a question. Why did you feel it was necessary to reply to this thread three times yet I just had to go a third party website to answer a question I posed to you directly about transmog and artifact weapons. <br />
Let me start by saying that I come to the forums when I can, that being said, I don't always get to spend much time in them since I have other duties beyond just posting here. The question was answered on that third party site because during events like gamescom we do interviews with people on the latest information while the information is fresh and the people who want to do interviews and the people doing the interviews are in the same location. I could have pointed you to the interview and started to, but saw others had also already posted and shared it in several locations on the forums. <br />
<br />
I also asked you about the flight meta in Legion in another thread, but I don't even expect an answer to that. The transmog answer was on Icy Veins, but what if I didn't know about Icy Veins. Third party websites should not be your primary source for giving out information. <br />
<br />
I have no problem whatsoever with blues replying to threads like this one or the silly ones about cats wearing socks or whatever. How about also maybe answering player questions from time to time as well, maybe at least an equal rate as you all post in fluff threads. I know fluff posts are a lot easier to reply to. But this isn't your hobby, it's a job. <br />
It's a portion of my job, a very small portion, but one I take seriously. Often, it comes in the form of the blog posts on the front page among other things. &quot;Fluff&quot; posts (as you put them) have their place. They lift spirits, give us a chance to interact on a human level, reaffirm we're here and reading beyond just what is going on in said &quot;fluff&quot; post and more. Our job is like an iceberg. You only see the tip of it but it runs much deeper under the surface.<br />
<br />
I know not every question can get a direct a blue reply. That would not be feasible. However, you must admit that there is a very real perception that player concerns are not being addressed or even heard. Replying to more questions directly and having info on the actual game forum would go a long way to improving the situation.<br />
I completely agree there is a perception that some people have as to what we are or are not doing, answering or not answering. I'd love to say we can answer everything, but we can't or often can't right now. That doesn't mean it may not be getting answered whether directly or some other way. We are always watching, reading, compiling feedback, watching what people are saying, and more. <br />
<br />
I really don't mind answering this for you and explaining it a bit to you because if you're asking and wondering, others are too. This is what I can offer you right now. Just know we aren't sitting about idly waiting for something to pop up for us to do. We are always doing and planning. We'll keep on trying to keep in touch with you all on everything that we can as we can. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/382763-burning-disappoinment/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300188640?page=2#21))<br />
<br />
Feature Design<br />
So, they add features in an expansion, they build on them in the next, or take them away and replace them with other features, it all just seems so random.<br />
<br />
With MoP, we had Scenarios, they just got rid of them in WoD and decided we can't do them any more. Maybe just building on the infrastructure for solo scenarios during questing.<br />
<br />
We had Sunsong Ranch where you could get mats easily, then it was built on in WoD with us being able to get Ore and Herbs easily.<br />
<br />
We had Garrisons in WoD, and instead of building on that and giving us instanced Housing or anything in Legion, they just abandoned the concept entirely, and we get Guild Halls instead.<br />
<br />
Some things like PvP, transmog etc. just get built on over time and just get better and better. and of course Dungeons and Raids are pretty much a constant and a success.<br />
<br />
So why does it feel like Blizzard is just throwing Random stuff at us to see if it sticks, abandoning it if it doesn't, and trying something else?<br />
It's never random and it's not that things are &quot;taken away&quot; so much as changed or just not added into the next expansion. There are generally reasons behind it all even if they aren't terribly transparent (though we try to explain what as much as we can.)<br />
<br />
Sometimes it's an issue of compounding design that gets overly cumbersome and so it's better to move on with something newer than to keep iterating on the same thing. <br />
<br />
Sometimes it's better to iterate on something and change it up than leave it stagnating. <br />
<br />
Sometimes it's just a question of &quot;does this make sense as a part of the next expansion?&quot; If the answer is &quot;no&quot; and it's not part of the story and progression of that story, then it doesn't move on. <br />
<br />
There are myriad reasons for myriad design changes and we'll keep doing what we can to answer what we can for you. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/382757-it-all-seems-so-random/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18596060314?page=1#3))<br />

Pet Battle Bonus Event August 7-10<br />
Through Monday, August 10, Pet Battle experience gains are increased by +200%. There’s never been a better time to get out there and level up your mighty minions!<br />
<br />
Before you head out into the wild with your lower-level wild things, make sure you pick up the quest “The Very Best”. Because you’re the best – around – you’ll want to queue up for PvP Pet Battles with a team of three level-25 pets. After only five wins during the event, you’ll be rewarded with an Ultimate Battle-Training Stone, which means another level 25 is on its way to your collection.<br />
<br />
A few days ago, we listed some of the most-favored Battle Pets in the game and asked you to choose only one. There’s still time to cast your vote!<br />
<br />
What’s your team for PvP Pet Battles? We’d like to know, so tell us about it in the comments below.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
AMS has lower priority than healers' absorbs. I have to /cancelaura those to gain RP, kinda silly. Is it intended?<br />
Absorbs are checked and consumed from smallest to largest, and AMS is a large absorb. Intended, but yes, kinda silly. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/625726021401231364))<br />
<br />
If Death Strike shields are AM, why isn't Brewmaster Shuffle? Same exact premise, or Guard for that matter?@WarcraftDevs<br />
The official Active Mitigation mechanics are timing-based/reactive. Shuffle can be up nearly full-time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/625796023609225217))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
&quot;Wild Gladiator's Insignia of Conquest&quot; not accurately giving agility. Grants a little over 1000 not 1259. Please fix<br />
These items are giving the intended amount of stats; the tooltip is incorrect. This will be fixed in a future patch. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/626905621846056960))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Pvp is about beating better players. If i get stuck because i can't beat worse players that play better classes i want change<br />
Yeah, I think reaching a skill level goes hand in hand with investment. I've spent time on this, I don't want to be cheated. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/625502721320161280))<br />
<br />
with the whole mercenary thing is it auto assigned race or can I choose?<br />
Your mercenary race is auto-assigned. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/625725543153971200))<br />
<br />
With the incoming nerf to healing in PvP are there any plans to compensate Ret Paladins who rely on self healing for defense?<br />
No, we felt healing in the game in general needed to be reduced. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/625725753506664452))<br />

Hey is Zandalar still sinking or has it already sunk. Contradicting information in game makes it unclear.<br />
Still sinking last we heard. Complete disaster area! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/625512696855695360))<br />
<br />
I have a question relating to one I asked a couple of days ago. Since shaman manipulate chi per Kosak would former shaman still be able to manipulate chi?<br />
&quot;Chi&quot; is just the Pandaren term for the life force that Shaman manipulate. Same stuff. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/627166210862415876))<br />

Indeed. As leveling content I think treasures / rares worked very well. Addon or not they drove exploration.<br />
Glad you liked the new rare and treasure treatments. I was very eager to get those systems in to encourage exploration more. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/625501452761346048))<br />
personally, Wrath style leveling with rates / treasures would be the ideal. Looking forward to seeing that stuff in future lvlng<br />
I'm curious, what about wrath-style leveling stands out to you as an ideal? (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/625699312706523136))<br />
So I think Wrath's quest flow &amp; choice nailed the RPG in mmorpg &amp; that the exploration mechanics would accompany that very well.<br />
I do think there's some value in advancing the tone of how the player is regarded in a new expansion... (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/625801498136461312))<br />
...for the sake of preventing things from feeling stale if nothing else. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/625801529123966981))<br />
But I generally agree that I like that big open-world RPG feel most. A surprisingly divisive topic in my experience. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/625801873748967424))<br />

Are the shipyard blueprint drops added in yesterdays hotfix the unobtainable ones? (ammo reserves, extra quarters, etc) thanks<br />
No, we have no plans to make these blueprints available. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/626520414634663936))<br />
<br />
PTR<br />
Lots and lots of updates to bugs reported for 6.2.1, thanks for all of the reports! Should now also be able to fly in Stormshield/Warspear. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/626274315374301184))<br />
since its a small area I'm not sure flying should be a thing there, but thanks for the update! Can't wait for it to go live!<br />
It was a pain to be able to fly there only to be dismounted at the last second in the water. Let us know if there are issues. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/626283269638762496))<br />
<br />
To curb speculation: Swift Spectral Rylak, like Swift Spectral Gryphon, is a &quot;while you're dead&quot; flying mount, not an obtainable mount. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/626294534532677632))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
so whats up with all the stuff being added to the game but not added to the game?<br />
All the things? Is there anything else? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/626155245576581121))<br />
Tune-o-Tron Micro I found Pepe seems like things are added on the front end then forgotten the carrot is there and then taken away<br />
Tune-o-tron micro is the port. audiophone it was just added twice by accident and the old name was left in. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/626222567171485696))<br />
Not every thing that is datamined as in the game is in the game, you can find tons of items that are never dropped. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/626222692694380544))<br />
its not about data mining. Those two are listed in game, toybox and achievements<br />

It makes me uncomfortable that they don't know yet.<br />
<br />
The item bonus system (Warforged, sockets, and extra stats) worked out well, so it could be extended to have even more bonuses.<br />
I disagree, I thought it was terrible. Too much randomness. Too much RNG. It is RNG stacked on RNG. <br />
<br />
Go back to the old enchant and gem system, and then have the WF and tertiary stats stay the same as WoD. Having people in your raid with 8 sockets and you have none is crazy. that is a 600 stat advantage in identical gear. It's immense. Yes that it extreme, but it is currently happening in my guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is happy with how flying worked out in Draenor. You will have to level up and explore the land before you are able to fly, similar to what is coming in Patch 6.2.1.I'm fine with working for it, I just don't want to have to wait a year.<br />
<br />
PS - Still no flying.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team still wants to release expansions faster.no one wants this other than Activisions wallets.<br />
<br />
<br />
The cinematic isn't complete just yet.<br />
This xpac may be further away than we all are hoping. Strap in for a few 8 months of WoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. CMs uncertain? :( Bloody hell<br />
2. It's unsettling to hear them say that 4 leather users/2 mail users isn't a problem due to the prevalence of personal loot. WHAT ABOUT GUILDS? I had assumed drop rates would reflect the leather/mail user imbalance, but this statement doesn't imply it at all.<br />
3. Possibly no L110 talent? Sure, I get the Artifact argument, but when we're level 120 in the next expansion, how is that going to help us? 20 (long) levels without a new talent when leveling seems bland.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grimalkin of Old</div><div class="date">2015-08-08, 05:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The team strongly believes that WoW is best played with friends. It is the most fun when you can make connections with other players in game or bring in friends from outside the game and play together.<br />
The subscriber count is more volatile than it used to be because players have gotten older and don't have as much free time anymore. As long as players are happy and enjoy the game, the team doesn't mine extreme peaks and valleys. They just want to ensure you have a great experience and feel like you got your money's worth.<br />

<br />
It makes perfect sense. I can see how it mite seem weird the way it's worded, but it is clearly stating that they want to remove PVP gear, and your power/capability's in PVP will be determined by your Gear and Talents (Gear, in this sense, meaning the gear you have, not PVP specific gear as that will be gone)</div></div><hr />

<br />
After watching the video, my understanding is there is no more PVP gear, and that PVE and PVP will have the same item level? and that you can obtain gear through PVE and PVP (but not through honor/conquest points, so maybe like the strongboxes?)<br />
<br />
What I don't understand though is, if this is true raids will still have the highest ilvl which means raiders will have a huge advantage over PvPers unless the gear obtained through PVP is also the same ilvl.. Which would mean that raiders will be forced to PVP in order to compete and stay on top. <br />
<br />
I'm so confused</div></div><hr />

The laziness behind this layers of difficulties of raid is hurting this game like hell. Do they really think adding a new level of difficulty to a raid can be considered as new CONTENT? no and fuck no, they are not helping anyone feeling better but cutting the design budget so they save the money for their own. As WoW gets more shitty and crappy every expansion, the more they cut design budget so you can see the expansion geographic size is getting smaller, the patch content is getting thinner--6.1 totally rubbish. Player-base ends up WoD by only two tiers which is literally a fucking joke even to the most shameless dev. WoW becomes more like bullshit each day because Blizzard doesn't invest into game design, they may put some money on promotion, trailer, in-game store product stuff like that, but THEY DON'T INVEST GAME CONTENT.<br />
<br />
So what are we gonna get, some once-done forever-gone dungeons? two tiers of raids? feels exactly the same as WoD, mythic dungeon for catch-up system? same old crap like Tannan Jungle for free loot gears? yeah, that's really refreshing and creative, they probably think we haven't done that enough yet. fuck you time travel 5 times for a coin.<br />
<br />
This lame game really needs an operation like different raids for different difficulties, give me a triple-sized geography than WoD so I won't feel like IT ONLY TAKES 5 MINUTES TO WALK FROM FAR EAST TO FAR WEST, 3 tiers of raids at least otherwise PVE serves no purpose.<br />

My assumption is that they're going to set PvP interactions to be a certain ilvl so that no matter your gear, you get scaled up or down depending on what they decide the appropriate level will be.

Survival Hunters were very melee focused back in Vanilla (and I thought TBC but maybe just vanilla). This is a return to form for them, bringing back a style that should've been in the game the whole time - just look at Rexxar, one of the biggest Hunter hero characters from WC3, he's a melee hunter.</div></div><hr />

For all your yelling and immature cursing, you don't seem to have a very good idea about how game development works.<br />

Why in the heck would a hunter be melee? I've been sv hunter for over 6 years. We have pallys, warriors, dks, monks for melee, we don't need another melee class, much less a hunter melee class. Please leave the sv hunters alone.<br />
<br />
As noted, this is going back to the root of the class acutally ,so I'm not against seeing what they can come up with. <br />
<br />
That said, I do hope they have some ideas for making sure Melee don't feel so extraneous. If you watch Fatboss videos now, about half of the HFC ones say &quot;Bring your best DPS, more ranged than Melee&quot; all ready.<br />
<br />
Be that more ways in and out of combat, ways for melee to still deal damage when not in melee range, or just designing bosses with fewer periods of running away (glaring as you Xhul...)</div></div><hr />

You're what's wrong with this game's community. They have to measure their words carefully so folks like you don't crucify them for saying something wrong or changing something they said.

It'll be interesting for sure, what they add. DH are getting 2 specs, and hunters are essentially getting a revamped spec, kind of making up for DH not having 3 specs I guess.</div></div><hr />

No, I'm pretty sure what's wrong with this community is people blindly sucking up to every thing Blizzard say and do out of some misplaced need for acknowledgment, letting them think everything they do is wonderful while the player-base crumbles to dust around them.<br />
<br />
<br />
And then when they speak so measured, you crucify them for not giving you the specifics.<br />
I didn't say anything about 'specifics' (if that were the case I would've quoted things like the artifact or professions points that are completely vague but obviously planned out - secretly), I'm &quot;crucifying&quot; them for not having a clue of wtf they are doing.<br />
<br />

As I already quoted, they said the beta is scheduled for the end of this year, the release scheduled for (early) next year and the following (super quick!) expansion is already being planned. All of these very close time frames and yet they have no idea about half of the content listed IN this expansion + NO solid plans for post-release content. No I'm not &quot;just voicing my concern&quot;, I'm pointing out that this is already a WoD-level pile of crap and Blizzard haven't learnt anything.<br />
I was interested by the premise (as I was with WoD) and the Demon Hunter but these interviews have shown Blizzard are still going down the same route of charging more for less, well actually charging more for next-to-nothing.</div></div><hr />

You have it the other way around buddy. What they said in those interviews is exactly what we should be afraid of. Legion has been in development for a long time now yet it seems they have no idea about how most of the things they showed us will be handled! And thats just alarming. You know whats worse than bad developers? Devs who aren't sure. And if they really have no idea how to approach certain areas, now it's time to really start listening to the player's feedback because if they won't, we'll end up with WoD 2.0 instead of BC/WotLK 2.0. <br />
<br />
Get your head out of your ass next time before you attack another person for pointing out something wrong about the game and its course. Blizzard is not the saint one.</div></div><hr />

They mentioned nothing about daily quests coming back, which means we might be getting more Timeless Isle crap. They also said they have no patch plans yet for Legion, yet they're already working on the next expansion. Could content patches be going away completely and the only way we get new content is buying a new box? Worrying stuff...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost1987</div><div class="date">2015-08-08, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The laziness behind this layers of difficulties of raid is hurting this game like hell. Do they really think adding a new level of difficulty to a raid can be considered as new CONTENT? no and fuck no, they are not helping anyone feeling better but cutting the design budget so they save the money for their own. As WoW gets more shitty and crappy every expansion, the more they cut design budget so you can see the expansion geographic size is getting smaller, the patch content is getting thinner--6.1 totally rubbish. Player-base ends up WoD by only two tiers which is literally a fucking joke even to the most shameless dev. WoW becomes more like bullshit each day because Blizzard doesn't invest into game design, they may put some money on promotion, trailer, in-game store product stuff like that, but THEY DON'T INVEST GAME CONTENT.<br />
<br />
So what are we gonna get, some once-done forever-gone dungeons? two tiers of raids? feels exactly the same as WoD, mythic dungeon for catch-up system? same old crap like Tannan Jungle for free loot gears? yeah, that's really refreshing and creative, they probably think we haven't done that enough yet. fuck you time travel 5 times for a coin.<br />
<br />
This lame game really needs an operation like different raids for different difficulties, give me a triple-sized geography than WoD so I won't feel like IT ONLY TAKES 5 MINUTES TO WALK FROM FAR EAST TO FAR WEST, 3 tiers of raids at least otherwise PVE serves no purpose.<br />
<br />
GIVE ME ALL THOSE INCONVENIENCES BACK IN VANILLA AND BC, because that feels like gaming, what I have now is ordering pizza and clicking facebook game which is even worse than watching a camera whore's streamer.<br />
<br />
If you weren't an idiot, you'd notice that the different difficulties serve as a way to filter out players based on their skill lvls and to make a smooth transition to high end raiding with alts. Players that are unfamiliar with the game can learn mechanics on the easier difficulties until they become honed enough to take on the higher difficulties. With mythic being an inflexible raid size of 20 people, many guilds have resigned from mythic raiding due to the large effort in maintaining a high amount of quality players but at least with multiple difficulties, it allows an influx of people to transition to the level of skill lvl required by those guilds. This at least lessens the impact of the inflexible mythic structure.<br />
<br />
I like the catch up mechanics because I enjoy playing multiple toons, which keep the game fresh since it puts a different spin on the same content. Back in Vanilla days, you pretty much lvled your first class and then you were stuck with it because having an alt required too much work. This made the game pretty boring since playing one class can only remain entertaining for so long.<br />
<br />
Putting the &quot;inconveniences&quot; back in the game is a stupid idea. Inconveniences felt like chores, much like washing dishes, and I don't pay 15 dollars a month to wash dishes. If you feel the need to for inconvenience, let me know because I could use a personal driver to get me around when I go out at night. And to further bolster the inconvenient feeling, you can give me 15 dollars at the end of the night.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Survival Hunters were very melee focused back in Vanilla (and I thought TBC but maybe just vanilla). This is a return to form for them, bringing back a style that should've been in the game the whole time - just look at Rexxar, one of the biggest Hunter hero characters from WC3, he's a melee hunter.<br />
<br />
The whole hunter concept seems like a good idea. I remember hunters being OP back in vanilla since you can kite but then do good dmg even if someone got in melee range. Now, we get full on class/spec identity which is awesome. Right now, there isn't much of a difference in feeling from the 3 hunter specs.</div></div><hr />

Anything else then unlock flying direct at lvl max Ding it mean I won't buy this expansion.<br />
I didnt bought WOD after I had played since Beta without pause. And I am too tired with this noflying sht. So tired, that I will skip 100% any expansion where they will keep implementing this noflying nonsense.<br />

So, Blizzard is foregoing conventional looting mechanics and just eradicating weapons entirely with the exception of this new wacky Artifact system? Great. I'll have ZERO incentive to switch specs and thoroughly enjoy my class because even with &quot;catch up&quot; mechanics, I'm not doing multiple Artifact quest chains for one character. All of this pales in comparison to how terrible this system sounds; it's like a retread of Diablo and an Ultima Online weapon leveling system.<br />
<br />
<br />
The goals is to remove PvP gear. There will be PvP ways to obtain gear, but the power in PvP will be about the gear you obtain and the PvP talents that you unlock.<br />
As has been mentioned already, this makes absolutely no sense at all. Why do an overhaul of a PvP system that only needed better tuning (i.e. matchmaking)? I thoroughly enjoyed being able to charge through battlegrounds on my way to purchasing a full S2 set.. a set that (for once) doesn't penalize me in PvE for basic farming. Faction imbalance is the problem, not the fundamental design of PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />

Yay! So the 1% will have flying. Sounds good. /endsarcasm<br />
<br />
<br />
The team still wants to release expansions faster.<br />
Legion will release next year, but no specific date has been set yet.<br />
There isn't a solid patch schedule plan for Legion yet.<br />
The expansion after Legion is already being planned.<br />
This entire section is of major concern to me. This sounds more like amateur developing where meeting deadlines becomes more important than a quality product. Oh wait...<br />
<br />
<br />
There are a lot of surprises in store for players in Legion and the team doesn't want players to think we are just going back to the same stuff.<br />
Oh, no. I don't think we're going back to the same &quot;stuff&quot;. We're getting an entirely new game called &quot;Call of Diablo in Skyrim&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons are staying in Draenor, so you can go back and visit them if you want.<br />
Gee. So after cramming garrisons down our throat, forcing us to upgrade them and spend significant time in them, implementing insane gold costs that handicap new players and players who aren't gold-capped, only to subsequently nerf the gold instead of scaling it based on each player's net worth, you're going to forego garrisons entirely and waive a wasted investment on these garrisons. Thanks for saying my hard work on eight toons is irrelevant to you!<br />
<br />
<br />
The subscriber count is more volatile than it used to be because players have gotten older and don't have as much free time anymore. As long as players are happy and enjoy the game, the team doesn't mine extreme peaks and valleys. They just want to ensure you have a great experience and feel like you got your money's worth.<br />
This is just priceless. &quot;Players have gotten older&quot;.. evidently they're unaware of the maturity level in this game which isn't just a byproduct of anonymity but actual age. Most of the players who have &quot;gotten older&quot; have moved on and those of us who have remained have done so for a niche product, not the scrap heap of systems they intend to push down our throats in Legion.</div></div><hr />

The team doesn't want it to be too painful if you want to change specs, so there might be some kind of catch up mechanic for getting the Artifact weapon for another spec.<br />
<br />
<br />
I can't even believe these bullet points are even possible. Hardly anyone I know wants to do the stupid ring quest on more than 1 or 2 characters. It's made leveling alts for raid incredibly troublesome and not fun at all. Last expansion I level'd one of each class to 90. This expansion I can't even be bothered. I get a little wind in my sails and excited to level a new toon and then I remember just how far behind it is in the grand scheme of things when it comes to the ring and that stupid shipyard. And now they aren't going to have a catch up mechanic for alts. Poor form blizzard.<br />
<br />
Not to mention my guild is not a hardcore guild. We manage a 20 person Mythic raid team and have fun playing together. It has taken a long time to build the group we have and the community we have. We don't raid long hours and we don't care about rank. We have several people that swing offspec heals and tanks to make sure we don't miss a raid night. And we haven't missed one in a VERY long time. Possible catch up for offspec is ludicrous at best. With no lootable weapons and being forced to use and level a weapon for each spec I hope Blizzard suffers for it. Having to recruit enough specs and people so that we can remain non-hardcore and still see the content in time with these types of decisions is going to be way more trouble than it is worth. Stupid decision if it stands and probably the death of many raid teams that count on offspec/alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Flying is a stuff up at the moment. They need to give people incentives to do the content, not force them to do it to get flying.<br />
2) Raiding is not fine at the moment. It's fine for the people who are happy to do the odd LFR and for those that want to go up the chain to mythic. The people who want challenging content that's accessible are not fine.<br />
3) The artifact has just become the new group blocker. Anyone joining the game after the initial release is pretty screwed.<br />
4) Disc Priests have just become the go to healer. If you are battling with enrage timers or anything like that then having a spec that can do 50% damage is irreplaceable.<br />
5) A whole new continent. 75% of which will be out of date by the time you hit level 110. They need to stop that crap. They are effectively forcing people to rush through the zones to get to the end game. What they should be doing is letting people start the end game immediately and then give them reasons to go out and explore the zones. Give them decent rewards for doing it. Rares that have a small chance to drop epics, rewards for map completion. That's their &quot;reason to get out into the world&quot; in between raids.<br />
<br />
I was given a 7 day pass. I spent at most 3 hours online. I was bored stiff. I queued for LFR and got into a raid and it was boring as hell. Did a couple of BG's and they hadn't changed one bit since Cata. If you are not doing serious raiding (maybe PVP too as I don't do that) then the game is boring.<br />
<br />
p.s. Saying that they don't design the game around subs is an outright lie. Everything they do is about subs. Their releases are timed to boost the sub numbers so the devs have those deadlines. My free trials are timed to coincide with the Q3 numbers, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which is what makes me confused.<br />
<br />
Chilton explicitly explained, with a slide and everything, that the problem with PvP is that the gear disparity between a newbie PvPer and a PvPer who's been at it for a long time will be nearly double, and they want to fix that. But then they haven't changed anything if you just need PvE gear; it will be a case of people coming out of fresh questing gear / heroic dungeon gear against people in raid gear. They've solved nothing.<br />
<br />
What they need to do is normalize the ilvl. As soon as you go into a PvP environment (Arena, Battleground, Ashran, Wintergrasp, etc) your ilvl gets scaled to a fixed amount, say... ilvl 800, or however high the end-game dungeon gear is.</div></div><hr />

This isn't a new thing. In fact, Cataclysm was pretty much the first and only expansion that gave you flying immediately at level 80 that you used to zip and zoom around zones from 80 to 85.<br />
And oh how people complained up a storm about that. How unengaging it made the world. <br />
So in Mists it went back to having to level all the way to max level, and then you had to go spend a good chunk of money to learn flying.<br />
(gold sinks are not a new thing.) But the whole not being able to get 'x flying' until max level started in BC. And the mounts and the flying were a huge gold sink.<br />
Never mind it was hard as hell to get gold back then.<br />
<br />
Then there was Wrath of the Lich King. Does anyone remember having to save up that 5k gold just so they could fly in Northrend? I know I do.<br />
<br />
I get people not enjoying the idea of having to do meta-achievements to fill one ultimate meta-achievement.<br />
But honestly, if you couldn't be assed to do the one for WoD then I don't know what to tell you. I don't have a lot of free time. And the moments that I do, I don't spend it all day on WoW.<br />
I still managed to get the meta-achievements in a decent amount of time. I skipped lots of days of doing dailies to get the tanaan rep and everything.<br />
I only gave 1.5 to 2.5 hours to Tanaan when I did do the dailies (which is about how much time it takes to do them anyway. so. lol).<br />

It's funny. I keep hearing people complain that WoW is too easy, so Blizzard keeps making hard content for them... <br />
And then other players complain about how it's too hard and Blizzard is stupid for making content harder.<br />
That being said, Raids technically aren't supposed to be piss easy. Perhaps we should check the pulse on full time raiders and see if they wanted raids to be harder.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
From what I've heard... Survival hunters were mainly melee in Vanilla. So this is going back to the spec's roots if that is true.<br />
Never mind that all hunters used to have melee attacks and could have both a bow and melee weapons equipped, and would switch out depending on whether an enemy was far away or an enemy had come into melee range.<br />
<br />
Are you implying though, that no one plays feral druids when they can be Balance druids then? Because that's another class that can both have melee fighters and ranged fighters...<br />
And I see plenty of people playing both depending on what they like to play. lol</div></div><hr />

The flying concept fo example is great because it gives you a challenge, a carrot on a stick to go for to be able to unlock flying on all your characters instead of having to pay 5k gold each which is horrible. Being able to fly should be for those who give atleast a little bit of effort. <br />
<br />
The PvP system sounds great to me as long as raiders can't come in with Mythic gear and roflstomp everyone, it should be that ilvl is balanced out in PvP so those with talents excel beyond others even that not by a lot.<br />
<br />
Love that they are putting more focus on the professions.<br />

Survival hunters being melee is really an interesting concept. If they are to balance out raid fights to the point where melee has the upper hand in around 50% of fights that's fine. It could also be an interesting concept for other areas than raiding (BECAUSE THE WOW DOESN'T REVOLVE COMPLETELY AROUND RAIDERS EVEN IF YOU THINK SO... atleast it isn't meant to be.) I for one would love to try being a melee hunter like Rexxar often is swinging his axes.<br />
<br />
Finally I am excited for these surprises they seem to have in store.</div></div><hr />

We won't be looting any weapons... because we will get the artifact weapons pretty much immediately.<br />
And while we level they will grow with us/we will unlock more with them/etc.<br />
Therefore there will be no better weapon for us the entire expansion, so there is no point for us to loot another weapon.</div></div><hr />

I'm implying that I need 2 weapons: a 2-hander for the all around daily mob smashing and a healing 1-hander for 5-mans, raids and whatnot.<br />
So, if I get the healing mace artefact (from my understanding, they are spec-based), I was wondering how I will get the 2-hander version.<br />
(hopefully, I'll be able to craft one with blacksmithing, even if it's just blue).<br />

Hardly anyone I know wants to do the stupid ring quest on more than 1 or 2 characters. It's made leveling alts for raid incredibly troublesome and not fun at all. Last expansion I level'd one of each class to 90. This expansion I can't even be bothered. I get a little wind in my sails and excited to level a new toon and then I remember just how far behind it is in the grand scheme of things when it comes to the ring and that stupid shipyard. And now they aren't going to have a catch up mechanic for alts. Poor form blizzard.<br />
<br />
Not to mention my guild is not a hardcore guild. We manage a 20 person Mythic raid team and have fun playing together. It has taken a long time to build the group we have and the community we have. We don't raid long hours and we don't care about rank. We have several people that swing offspec heals and tanks to make sure we don't miss a raid night. And we haven't missed one in a VERY long time. Possible catch up for offspec is ludicrous at best. With no lootable weapons and being forced to use and level a weapon for each spec I hope Blizzard suffers for it. Having to recruit enough specs and people so that we can remain non-hardcore and still see the content in time with these types of decisions is going to be way more trouble than it is worth. Stupid decision if it stands and probably the death of many raid teams that count on offspec/alts.<br />
<br />
They did say there was going to be offspec catchups so you can still swing the offspec heals or tanking.<br />

No, this is dumb. If i have to grind dailies then I do it on one toon. If i play only one toon, then i get bored fast and stop playing. I don't pay 15 dollars a month to do crappy grind chores, I do it so I can get in there and do work.

<br />
This. I'm still raw over the WoD experience and its pricetag considering what was delivered and the indifferent reception player feedback seemed to be given the first half of the expansion. Pushing expansions faster with less content for more money is not a business model I'm interested in supporting, especially when that content is not well thought-out. It's a shame that there's so much talent on the project (art resources, raid balance, etc) and yet the hand(s) on the wheel don't know where they're going.<br />
<br />
And what is with this psuedo ret-con and/or weak story with Illidan? He was recaptured and taken off by Maiev at the conclusion of Black Temple. This &quot;we don't know where his remains are&quot; business is idiocy. Imagine the conversation...<br />
<br />
Warden: &quot;Hey, Maiev. What should we do with this guy... the one you were clearly obsessed with and chased all over Azeroth and then Outlands. He only went mad, overthrew a Pit Lord in Outlands, then sent some demons to attack Azeroth. He was responsible for countless atrocities a few thousand years ago. Plus he's Malfurion's brother.&quot;<br />
<br />
Maiev: &quot;Illidan? I'm not obsessed with him and I'll prove it! I'm not going to watch over him 24/7 like it's my job, and instead will encase him in fel carbonite and... leave him completely unguarded in a dimly lit place without any boobytraps, safeguards, or alarms. Because... I'm not obsessed with him! Besides, a bunch of level 70s took him out years ago, so... what's the worst that could happen?</div></div><hr />

Try reading what he said first, god your posts are just fucking awful. He's saying he's holy, and without weapons dropping he has no way to obtain a weapon to use for his offspec while he does quests and dailies. Healers need an offspec to do quest content and all he's left with is a long ass quest chain to get an artifact weapon. That's just stupid. So healers are fucked.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghost1987</div><div class="date">2015-08-08, 12:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they way dungeons and such should be formatted is that they give you an advanced objective in addition to completing the dungeon. For instance, if you're a DPS role, then an objective would be to pull x amount of dmg during the fight. It would start off as a low amount and then would scale with your gear. So if you're a fresh max lvl toon, then the dmg requirement to complete the advanced objective would be lower than if you gained 20 more ilvls. Once completed, it would reward gear that was at the level of the objective. So a low ilvl dude goes in to complete the objective and he gets, let's say, an 800 ilvl piece for doing his lower tier dmg. Then 20 ilvls later, the dmg req for the advanced objective would scale with your ilvl, requiring you to do more dmg to complete but also rewarding, let's say, 825 gear. The same would go for healers with healing or tanks with dmg taken.<br />
<br />
This would give players an incentive to continue running the dungeons so they can get rewarded for their good performance which would aid in the transition to raiding. Those who fail the objective would just get standard loot. In this way, the 5k dps dude in your dungeon would actually benefit by learning his class so that he can get better rewards instead of being rewarded for getting carried. Ultimately, I think this would raise the overall skill level of the community.</div></div><hr />

Meh, it's true though. A large chunk of people have been playing this game for ages and another large chunk came back shortly for WoD to see if they could relive old times. The game simply doesn't attract so much new public anymore. Old public (like me) don't have time anymore. When I started I was 19 and studying. Now I'm 30 with a partner and a child and have 2 jobs. They can make the game the best game the world has ever seen, still wouldn't bring more time into my life.</div></div><hr />

You've obviously not been in a progression guild.<br />

Weapons are so very essential to dps it's crazy. Not having a weapon drop might lead to your guild not being able to progress. It's just that simple.<br />

Artifacts is probably the best thing they could've done to prevent this and keep the balance in raids.<br />

It's happening, and it needs to happen. There is almost no actual differentiation between hunter specs.</div></div><hr />

Besides the damn kind of spell how are mage specs that much different??? Might as well make a damn mage melee spec. They can use swords and daggers you know. Why not a ranged death knight spec. Turn arms warriors into a ranges spec. Rogues can then use bows, stealth from afar.</div></div><hr />

The sub drop has nothing to do with age. I used to play mmorpgs back when they existed. Due to your self admitted greedy perversion of the genre.. All that is left is this faux mmo design. Still I play more now with a family and home and kid than I did during original EQ at 16 years old and guess what? I preferred things more difficult and requiring more of an investment than they do now by a mile. Age is an excuse for people that treat mmos like any other game and aren't willing to invest any time or effort.<br />
<br />
You guys then jade players who give up free time or other games by making their efforts a joke.<br />
<br />
Immersion (a key part of the real mmorpg experience) is all but absent in wow. This is due to things like instant travel. Instancing. Auction houses. Group queuing. This is basically a moba with chat. A fantasy like cod. (Then you add prestige LOL). The list continues, removing gear from pvp because it makes you more powerful?! No shiv... How is that unfair as if it needs to be fair anyways? The gear is already shamefully easy to obtain and available to anyone. The only people without it, and crying are the people unwilling to put in the work. Heck, I'd like 75k a year but I didn't finish college. Perhaps I can use your outlook to convince my boss to give me the same wages as those who did?<br />
<br />
Let's get some mmorpg back in our fauxmmo. Some immersion, contestation, challenge? Stop letting the kids control the direction of the game and make you own decisions. You are the designers.. If they don't like YOUR game they can go elsewhere. <br />
<br />
Want to retain players? Quit making it stupid easy. The only people who want it dimmed down are the revolving door folks. Real mmo purists pick a game and invest. Long term loyal subscribers. Some people are still subbed to Everquest, never left for a day. I can cap a toon here in less time than it took for ONE LEVEL in Everquest. Then you take new classes and pre level them?! Seriously?<br />
<br />
Why not just remove the rest of the game with each expansion and remove levels all together? That seems to be what your gunning for. It used to take a few amazing weeks to get to cap in vanilla. Now I do that same spread in ONE DAY. Each expansion you completely cut off the rest of the world by portals; nerfs, and atrocious mudflation. Then you wonder why you or need a squish. EQ never had a squish and 16 or so expansions later and geared tanks still have less hp than a level 30 here. Do you need to double stats each xpac for the kids? Is 10 more str not good enough?<br />
<br />
I realize now I can go on and on and on. The only reason I'm still here and have been here for ages are friends and my guild and the time I invested making it what it is. If that was gone tomorrow, so would I be without a flinch.<br />
<br />
Is a game that affords you 31 max level characters really what you want to be playing? Know how many I had in my 7 year tenure in EQ1? One single toon. And it still wasn't maxxed. Heck they even released content slower than blizzard.<br />
<br />
If anyone is interested I have a pdf copy of a CMU professors dissertation on the state of the mmorpg. It's a long read but it boils down to it being a travesty and the overbearing cause being blizzard and the demographic they cater too. I've always found it analogous to the wii. We all know how that went long term. Perhaps blizzard could care less about long term, they think with their wallets and the purity of the genre isn't even in their vocabulary.</div></div><hr />

Survival actually has a history of melee abilities(Raptor Strike et al) especially in Vanilla PvP. Mages do not. Plus they are drawing off of inspiration like Rexxar for this. Pull your head out of your ass and start thinking critically. Plus, if you want a ranged Hunter spec, you still have 2 to choose from. Plus, I can assure you Frost, Arcane and Fire play very different. MM, Surv, BM do not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You act like the 'hate&quot; is unfounded and just exists because - after the clusterfuck that WOD was and is, it's entirely deserved.<br />
<br />
It's kind of what I expected - they flash some shines at us at Gamescom, and now all of a sudden they can do no wrong, and any negative comments are just people complaining for no reason.<br />
<br />
It's this kind of bullshit that's driving me away from this game. Just fucking tired of it. They burned me on WOD, and I'm not handing over another dime to this company until they can show me they have their fucking act together - and I'm going to be vocal about that. Promises and shinies mean nothing. They haven't delivered anything yet, and I have every right to be as skeptical of their ability to do so.<br />
<br />
Angry? You bet your ass this community is angry, after squatting over everyone and pooping WOD on us. We're not leaving because we're getting older, we're leaving because the game stinks on ice, and the people defending them are fucking tiresome. They have a LONG road to proving Legion is playable and worth paying for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
these type of &quot;legendaries&quot; provide nothing except a huge road block to players that joined the expansion late or took a break, they are so severely punished to a point there is no reason to play WoW at all because no cloak/ring no raid spot, until u get the cloak/ring, go play with plebs in pugs n wipe on LFR / normal , cya.<br />
<br />
this rubbish &quot;legendary&quot; game model needs to stop, right now. It does nothing but KILL existing players' alts and new players + returning players. <br />
<br />
BLIZZ, SIMPLE STEPS ON HOW TO LOSE SUB : <br />
<br />
1. Force everyone into raid and only offer incentives in Raid, remove all rewards from doing world contents and faction reps.<br />
<br />
2. Make a 2-3 months road block to raid (hint : MOP , WOD legendaries). And put them behind the gate, in attempt to secure long term subs.<br />
<br />
3. Make the legendaries extremely powerful and are mandatory to secure a raid spot.<br />
<br />
4. Don't offer any catch-up mechanics, still heavily gated even when there is a new tier with no hope of brute forcing through it ,even if the players WANT to put in the same effort people previously have put in, to earn the legendaries legitimately. (blizz be like lol, ENTITLED scr0b, stay subbed n stay behind to gate n play the game, even when there is nothing to play because blizz gated everything, quit being ENTITLED)<br />
<br />
5. Watch new + returning players / existing players' alts try hard to catch up for 1 month but then realizes that it will take another 2 months just to catch up and miss out on everything (everything as in, actually playing the game A.K.A. raiding with a srs group , WOD is shit, it has nothing but raid).<br />
<br />
6. Watch the sub numbers fall and laugh out loudly.<br />
<br />
7. Repeat 1-6 in Legion. But split it across all 3 specs this time, HARD MODE.</div></div><hr />

That in itself pretty much shows the level of shameless arrogance of the team. &quot;The team realizes that flying was handled very poorly&quot; would have been a PASSABLY acceptable downplaying of reality. This...is just pure denial. LOL Plus, it's kind of insulting to use past-tense to describe the situation since it's not even in the game yet.<br />

<br />
Apparently I am terrible at reading then because I could have sworn it said &quot;THERE MIGHT BE OFFSPEC CATCHUP MECHANICS&quot;? The fact that they are even thinking about not having this legendary work like every other gated POS legendary they have burdened everyone with is a bad sign. This legendary system is the biggest block to returning players. It is the biggest reason some of my friends won't return to the game. And I can't blame them. Every time I go to level and alt I remember that I have to do that stupid grind if I even want to join decent pugs later in the xpac and I give up. And now, that they are not going to have viable substitutions it is an even bigger problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And now not only do they punish alts, they're going to railroad us into a single spec. How can Blizz have be so out of touch with how their long term subscribers play the game? We have nothing left to do besides alts and alternate specs.</div></div><hr />

so you are saying that Raid Difficulty = High Sub numbers? WotLK had the highest sub numbers and I am gonna say that the raiding during that time wasn't as difficult as the raiding we have now.</div></div><hr />

I've always had a grinder element in me and this idea about weapons looks new and interesting, I'm personally interested.<br />
<br />
If I was to think back to the reasons why I've taken a break from the game however, reading some of the pretty vitriolic comments posted in this thread (some of which, I do agree with) it's always been either real life commitments (because I loved raiding with a Guild) or because the community had changed significantly in conjunction with the game just simply getting old. If my memory serves me correctly.<br />
<br />
- Vanilla - pre TBC - Burnout and access to raiding (how many alliance players chose to level to a dwarf priest just for fear ward and a raiding spot? I got to level 9 and ....delete!)<br />
- TBC/Wrath - Real life mainly. It was a really good community, I met a great bunch of people. But my life choices were based on my commitment to this game. Had to quit.<br />
- Cataclysm - I never played this expansion, this was more to do with real life, despite the negative and historical press this game has.<br />
- back of Mists/WoD - I think this is the first time I quit because there seemed to be a lack community. That's neither Blizzard's or the communities fault, more my own. I approached Mists and WOD with a single player mindset and bumped into a few friends along the way. Most quit by the time WoD's first raid instance was released. They had grown out of it, but a four year break from myself meant that I was experiencing everything for the first time. Did my fair share of PVP at the end of Mists and moved to a pugging and raiding mindset for WoD. Seven months in, I was tired of it. As you can expect with pugging, there is a lack of consistency (no shit?). There seemed to be a steady decline in skilled puggers when BRF was coming to an end. The transition between patches, I personally found tough. One week when a raid is listed, people are asking 10/10N experience. I quit.<br />
<br />
Moving on. I'm glad they are now not going forward with the garrisons in Legion. I never liked how it simply took over the game and made it a very single player game. I would really like to see professions become interesting again. I'd would personally look at joining a more active and friendly guild. We often blame the game, but sometimes we might need to change our approach to the game too. Blizzard really needs to give good incentives for guilds to stay banded together. Great guilds that don't do high end raiding are rarely rewarded. Bring the community back.</div></div><hr />

I'll say it again. It's hilarious how half the playerbase says that WoW is too easy.<br />
And the other half says it's too hard. And they both act like their opinions are absolute truth.<br />
I can see both sides, but I don't think either side is more 'right' than the other.<br />
<br />
And if we're talking about Demon Hunters... they are a hero class. <br />
Dunno if you were there for Death Knights (sarcasm), but they are also a hero class and came somewhat pre-leveled. <br />
That's half the point of them. They are supposed to 'start out stronger' or whatev.<br />

J. Allen Brack said they're happy with where they landed on flying in Draenor, which they're working on rolling out in the next patch.<br />

Obviously don't think they'll wait until the end of Legion to unlock flying. They're going to use the Pathfinder system where you unlock flying by completing some exploration-centric achievements with your gound mount.</div></div><hr />

Try reading what he said first, god your posts are just fucking awful. He's saying he's holy, and without weapons dropping he has no way to obtain a weapon to use for his offspec while he does quests and dailies. Healers need an offspec to do quest content and all he's left with is a long ass quest chain to get an artifact weapon. That's just stupid. So healers are fucked.<br />
<br />
They said in one intervju that the quest chain for the artifact weapon won't be so long or hard so just get a fucking lvl 100 2h and do it when you are max lvl, don't be such a cry baby over that you acually have to do things in the game if you want to change spec.</div></div><hr />

I have logged over 365+ days (8,760+ hours) in this game and have enjoyed it tremendously, really, until about the past 2-3 expansions. Given a new expansion, I was really expecting a huge knock-out-of-the-park expansion to the legendary game World of Warcraft. This expansion does not even come close. How could blizz not see the need to aim high and make a game better? Instead, it's the same 'ol hat...yay more demons (grrr). I watch the trailer and all I see is &quot;lame, lame, lame&quot;. Who is even in charge there anymore...LOL <br />
<br />
I have zero plans to play this upcoming expansion at all. Even more so is that they are revamping existing classes (again!) for little to no reason.

This feels like Garrisons all over again. Like a feature you can't do with out for the whole expansion that basically forces you to play a certain way. All in order to grow and develop the weapon. I really hope they learned from Garrisons but the announcement felt like they were carrying on with a lot of the features they added in WoD when this expansion began development. Then they decided to change a lot of stuff that has been seen negatively in WoD for Legion. Like they completely shifted gears in a different direction mid development. I still want to play it just because Demon Hunters is enough of a selling point to get me to play again but it looks like they haven't learned their lessons from WoD.</div></div><hr />

It's not like I'm hating on the people that do that, I just don't have the time or schedule to be able to do raids every week, and even then, I don't even enjoy it. Now, this is worrying me because of a quote from the original post: &quot;The Artifact weapons have Relic slots, which will determine its raw item stats (DPS, ilvl, etc.) and modifiers to the traits you've chosen, so the Artifact's stats will still improve as you defeat bosses.&quot;<br />
And artifact weapons are the only weapons in the entire expansion. So, then, all of the players that go out and do raids and dungeons will have better weapons for PvP?</div></div><hr />

Lawl. What people wanted was &quot;please no more 12 (ICC) - 14 (SoO) months content droughts at the end of an xpac&quot;, so: same amount of content in less time.<br />

What Blizzard apparently heard was &quot;less time and less content. Oh, and at a higher price while we're at it&quot;.<br />

Melee Hunter making a comeback is interesting, probably my most memorable dungeon run in vanilla was a Dire Maul where I got the Quel'serrar book... and the guy leading the group was a melee hunter. Pretty sure it was mostly for laughs because he was all decked out in t2 or whatever but he did the whole instance as melee.<br />

No weapons at all is pretty bold.. The artifacts are easily the central part of the expac now. It will at least feel better than grinding for a ring you can't even see.<br />

'The team is happy with how flying worked out in Draenor.' did he visibly twitch when he gave that response? Or did all those hours in front of a mirror practicing saying that with a straight face pay off?<br />
<br />
'The team strongly believes that WoW is best played with friends. It is the most fun when you can make connections with other players in game or bring in friends from outside the game and play together.' Yknow I get that I really do. I mean judging by the content you release you almost certainly believe the game is most fun with precisely 19 friends all of varying classes and specs.<br />
<br />
But you have to accept that a ton of people prefer to play this game solo, or at best with 1 or 2 others. Even the people who play with friends probably spend more than half their actual play time solo. You can't just ignore players who aren't 'social' enough for you.</div></div><hr />

haahahah they couldjust remove surv then it woudl have the same effect nobody will play melee if they can be range<br />

Try reading what he said first, god your posts are just fucking awful. He's saying he's holy, and without weapons dropping he has no way to obtain a weapon to use for his offspec while he does quests and dailies. Healers need an offspec to do quest content and all he's left with is a long ass quest chain to get an artifact weapon. That's just stupid. So healers are fucked.<br />
<br />
Apologies for the delay in response. I had to sleep.<br />
And then I had to go to work.<br />
<br />
To be honest, I did read what he said first. It was this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Great, so where will I get the 2-hander for the ret spec to do the stupid daily quests and other things? I'm afraid this is not going to end well. -_-<br />
<br />
And I didn't understand how he came to the conclusion he did. Maybe it's because I've watched the video a couple of times, and read stuff about this in about four or five different places so I get it. I don't know, however, why it would be hard to accept the quest as one spec, complete it and get your Artifact for that spec, and then turn around and change spec and accept the quest for your off spec and finish it as well. But who knows if that's how it's going to work. I don't see why it couldn't work that way? But, Blizzard has made asinine decisions in the past, and could technically restrict us with that. Like 'Oh no, no, no, you must level one spec's Aritifact first, then you can fuss with your off-spec's'<br />
<br />
However, it's stated in multiple places that we will be getting Artifacts for each of the specs we are and that there are going to be artifacts for each and every spec. So, I took it as them implying that somehow there is no Retribution Artifact weapon, or that it's impossible to get if it's not your main spec. I apologize for misunderstanding. Not sure misunderstanding is enough to warrant insults, but whatever rocks your boat.<br />
<br />
And rereading through, I realize that I must have confused some of the comments on this site with others on another site with the flying. I just made sure whether anyone had actually said anything of the sort, and I can't actually find anything on here. But then I was sifting through info on multiple tabs, so I'm not surprised I got mixed up. I apologize for that. Turns out people we having shit fits of different sorts on other sites (WHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL MAX LEVEL?!) where as here it's... well mixed. Some people don't want to have to unlock meta achievements to earn it. Other people want to pay a lump sum of money (works, but I've always hated that system.). I prefer earning it, over having it being the gold sink of the expansion. I'd rather sink my gold into mounts and stupid cosmetics.<br />

To be fair, FFXIV is actually fantastic. And TERA isn't bad. :|<br />
But so far those are the only other two I can stomach. In the past, when I didn't have money to play WoW I tried many an MMO.<br />

True about the transmog, but it would be nice to have lower level weapons that fit the theme of the expack to transmog TO. <br />

Do you mean beyond the multiple skin and colouring options each Artifact will offer? I find it hard to imagine there will be just sudden new transmogging looks. It's probably pick one of the Artifact's 30 or so variations or transmog to an older weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
let me show you the picture, 'cause fanboy is always blinded somehow. Excuses like &quot;the game being old, sub number still more than other MMORPG, people will come back, life cycle&quot; are completely bullshit. They mean nothing so don't delude yourself, this self-convincing is becoming like a cancer anyway.<br />
<br />
Game being old. true, but not the reason it sucks right now, sub number still leads MMORPG market, true, but give that credit to Vanilla, BC and WoLK because WoD feels like a unfinished project from some amateurs, don't mention it has half of the content to a normal one. people will come back, wrong, 'cause WoD has totally ruin and destroy the reputation of Blizzard and WoD, what's done can not be undone, thus the spike after new expansion release won't happen to Legion 'cause people with common sense don't buy the same crap again.<br />
<br />
Now players are a year away from legion release, a year of HFC will drain the player-base to a desert, Q3, 4M left, Q4 2-2.5M, so even legion would be released on time it wouldn't bring sub number back to more than 3M. Legion would start with sub number like 2.5M than by the time of the second major patch of legion being released, there would be only 2M left. Those figures are quite anticipated as legion has nothing new or different to WoD, raid structure, same, legendary for everyone, same, class hall with more followers, same crap again as WoD, oh wait, even the flight plan will be the same as WoD, so legion is basically the other half of the WoD which should have been released in WoD, Blizzard just breaks this expansion into two, and sell them respectively.<br />
<br />
This game is F dying because it has less and less playable content each expansion, WoD ends up with only TWO TIERs, legion probably the same, it's not about the age, it's more like Blizzard doesn't care, therefore, develop this game any further, everything wrong with WoW comes from this.</div></div><hr />

I never said that, because I have no idea where you pulled that number from. What I did say was it is most likely higher, though we'll never know as SE haven't/won't release exact figures. <br />
<br />
The only number they have released is a total of 5 million subscribers up to sometime before the expansion launch (not including trials) and the subscriber count was increasing, expected to increase more with Heavensward. 500k is just a made up amount, I could say there are 4.9m players atm and it would be just as truthful/useful a figure. Going off evidence though, 500k seems like an extremely low estimate.</div></div><hr />

Well... its up and counting. The news is that beta will &quot;hopefully&quot; start this year. We have never had a beta shorter than 6 months and if they start beta next December - we are talking August - September next year. Probably abit sooner to zynk with the movie. <br />

For me this is simply NOT acceptable. We lost one raid tier and it might maybe shorten the gap by 2-3 months. AT MOST between expansions.<br />

People are not complaining about having to level on foot (most of them, at least) but being grounded AFTER hitting max level. Which is actually the first time this crap is happening in an expansion.

<br />
So much lore and still they aren't using it, they could make Paladins into a tank/damage dealer class and a caster/healer class dependant on the weapon they hold. It's to the point the game will not change from Pandaria and the system isn't holding up to it's promise they have to make radical changes now or be forever lost.<br />
<br />
Like make offshoots of classes/specs dependant on what weapon they wield, it WORKS for 2 classes at the moment (Prot Paladin and Prot Warrior) so they can easily cut down on the number of specs, 3 specs are too much and it's a drain on resources on Blizzard<br />
<br />
They could make Druid into 3 specs, based on lore, Druid of the Flame, Claw and Talon (where bear form is 2 claws, and cat form is staff) <br />
They could make Paladin into 2 specs, based on lore, Order of the Sliver Hand, Blood Knights<br />

Im kinda worried that this will be the same case.<br />
<br />
I know that most of ppl will not agree with me, but will enhance shamans finally be reworked and something done about their button bloat? One of ideas is that shocks share one button, while you have flame shock debuff on target your flame shock will morph into earth shock.easy.<br />
<br />
Next.I dont like elfs.At all.ANY SORT of elfs. For 10y in this game i havent played elf at all, i havent even created one tbh. Even so i get the lore i find this limitation stupid. Sure DH cant be panda, but why not the ork for example, they used to have fell energies, are they not? further more, for example, warlocks, anything beside Ork, Forsaken and human has little logic, this is clearly the case of game-quality-over-lore so why not making exceptions here too? Were going back to our timeline, but changed with WoD and Guldan actions, theres a room for slight lore change.<br />
<br />
Another melee Leather user to the loot pool/raid slot? Blizz assures us that with personal loot everything is ok, but what about party/raid slots? Tanks and melee DPS? Taken in concern fact that there will be NO weapon drops, its a direct race of monks vs DHs, competing for those slots. And the race will be easy, which class performs better will be taken over other<br />
<br />
Finally.. As i previously said about elfs, as someone who really doesnt like elfs (any kind), even if i manage to force my self to play one cause of DH can we get a minor glyph to remove those wings in DPS meta?<br />
I would say, personally, they look horrific as i love minimalist and simple look.<br />
I would like to add here that i found offending when dude during Legion presentation said &quot;you can always create character without horns if something is really wrong with you&quot; as i planed to do so if i bit my lip and roll out as Elf DH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a matter of a personal opinion and freedom of speech. I dont see anything wrong with asking for a OPTIONAL minor cosmetic glyph, meaning that its an option of &quot;if you dont want it-dont use it.&quot;<br />
Further more i just stated obvious fact thats already &quot;in the air&quot; monks and DH will compete for raid/party slots, probaly druids too.<br />
Next, i dont see anything wrong with expressing my PERSONAL opinion because i dont like Elfs with &quot;only Elfs can be DH because.lore&quot; attitude when they work around/completely ignored lore not so few times and pointing out on possible lore that can allow other classes to be DH too.<br />
And i specifically dont see anything wrong expressing my PERSONAL opinion and saying that i found offending when blizz dev during official gamescon presentation said &quot;hey, we put this option in the game in case you want it but still something is wrong with you if you chose it.&quot; Those are the words of official blizzard representative during gamescon presentation.<br />

What I did say was it is most likely higher, though we'll never know as SE haven't/won't release exact figures. <br />
<br />
The only number they have released is a total of 5 million subscribers up to sometime before the expansion launch (not including trials) and the subscriber count was increasing, expected to increase more with Heavensward. 500k is just a made up amount, I could say there are 4.9m players atm and it would be just as truthful/useful a figure. Going off evidence though, 500k seems like an extremely low estimate.<br />
<br />
They did release the numbers, 1 million for all their games, with ffxiv having 500k. They never said 5 million ever, they have 4 million registered accounts. Wow has over 100 million. You are the one making up numbers, link to me this bullshit you're pulling out of your ass.<br />

Updated: These MMO figures actually come from an original financial report that was filed on March 31st, 2014. Square Enix tells MCV that the actual number of Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn paying subscribers sits at 500,000, with over 2.5m registered users. These numbers do not include the game's performance in China, which charges Chinese gamers on a per-minute pay model. A Realm Reborn will launch in Korea in 2015.<br />

I don't think even they can predict what effect some things will have. In my memory it started with adding pally to horde and shaman to alliance this had the effect of making the game a hell of a lot easier to balance but also stripped away some of the uniqueness of each faction. Some other examples:<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds - PvP much more accessible, world PvP pretty much dead.<br />
<br />
Flying - convenient time saver but world seems much smaller, world PvP suffered again, exploration lost all meaning at max level.<br />
Removed it in WoD - everyone whined.<br />
<br />
Dungeon finder - dungeons far more accessible, social interaction on a server level suffered a heavy price (those who played in vanilla will probably recall making friends and having conversations in dungeon groups). Instant teleport to dungeon made it so you are in a lobby instead of a world. Half my friends don't know where the dungeon entrances are.<br />
<br />
New talents - took away any remaining illusion of class customization experimentation, now you just pick what is best for each encounter - just the same as everyone else of your spec.<br />
<br />
Legendaries for everyone - legendary lost all meaning, just a required grind to get into high level raids... bit like attunements.<br />
<br />
Reforging - made non-optimal loot somewhat viable, removing it was just another slap in the face to those who actually like to experiment and try to do something different with their class.<br />
<br />
Achievements - something else to do/strive for. Downside: makes people waste time doing mostly unfun things to tick boxes.<br />
<br />
Warforges, sockets, tertiary stats - gives a reason to keep trying to get loot once fully geared, makes your performance based on RnG drops.<br />
<br />
Garrisons - finally someplace to call home in game... side effect everyone got sick of logging into garrison and doing facebook game chores.<br />
<br />
Collections/pets/mounts/pet battles - cool if you like that sort of thing, I personally love having a bunch of collections I know it's impossible to ever complete.<br />
<br />
So onward into Legion<br />
<br />
Making player head of class order - erm makes you feel important? Really though? What's next everyone is King of Stormwind?<br />
<br />
Everyone has 1 weapon - bye bye one of the best feeling in the game, getting a new weapon drop.<br />
<br />
Demon hunter - should be fun trying to make a raid team with 90% demon hunters.<br />

Sometimes Blizzard has bright ideas, but I personally think their game system designers lost the plot a long time ago. Admittedly this post has a negative tone but it's only because I watched a game I used to love and still want to love turn to shit. Why don't I quit? I have good friends that still play and nobody has ever made a better alternative (tried em all).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Good point. I'm not invested into the Artifact system, it's yet another experiment from them, and I can see both positive and negative on it - and the removal of the rng &quot;Lets kill everything in this sub zone and see what drops&quot; aspect is kind of sad. Yes, it's great to have a decent weapon and be working on it, I get it, I really do, but random weapon drops were always fun, especially for the unique, fun ones, like some of the claw weapons in the past. <br />
<br />
I guess it's the old Blizzard Pendulum, again, they can't do both, it's one extreme or another. It's not a game killing issue, but it's yet another facet, another component to the flavor of the game that's going away. Imagine Fallout 3 without weapon drops. Imagine Diablo III without them. The &quot;pull the level, win a prize&quot; thing is a crucial mechanic to keep people playing, the odds of getting a Krohl Blade in the wastelands in classic were low, but that didn't stop me from farming for one. It's a common feature of almost every RPG and MMO in existence. <br />
<br />
I hate it when the devs overthink things, looks like it's weapons this time around. Again, I can see how this is good, god knows I've been frustrated with gear drops in the past, and god knows they've trained us with gating weapons behind raids and currency for years, I just wonder how this will play out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, Blizzard lost the plot a long time ago... What is the reason we play RPGs? Stats? PVP? PVE? Immersion is the primarily reason and Garrisons show that Blizzard doesn't know what it was doing. Garrison broke the immersion of the game by making it 1 per character this meant your characters were not a part of the world and everyone created alts. They should of kept that in mind and allowed just 1 Garrison per server and allow your alts to serve as a soldier, professional or a commander. If they done that the game wouldn't of dropped to 5.6 million and still dropping.<br />
<br />
We want to get lost in the world and Garrisons in WOD detracted that. Garrisons should of been 1 per server per faction, having the same character doing the same mission on a alt breaks that, as soon as you see that, immersion is dropped and you believe your just playing a game that really alienates you rather than welcomes you. Garrisons was the main focus of WOD and they should of realize this. Hell they had a beta test with Sunsong Ranch, you could get away with 7 farms as it's unrealistic to have 7 characters to work on a small plot of land but Garrisons was much much larger.<br />
<br />
If they made the garrisons with your alts in the garrison electing one to be a commander that doesn't break immersion however having the same 25 characters across 7 alts does. As it seems that your character does that not really matter in the game.<br />
<br />
It was this one thing that broke the game, it wasn't the bloody raids, it wasn't the bloody dailies, hell it wasn't even the flying. It was the fact that Garrisons was character dependent which was a bad choice. It's ok with the HAll of Heroes as people are unlikely to play 2 druids but with Garrisons, everyone has an alt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Demon hunters will have a place in a raid but you should be more worried whether the game will survive past WOD. Garrisons have hurt the game beyond repair and have detracted many places from the game. People want Immersion and Garrisons unfortunately has broke that, this was a turning point in the game and it had to change but they just sat with the same model as the sunsong ranch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also no lootable weapons is stupid. What was I thinking when I thought u actually added an mmo feature and would give us an epic weapon quest. As such it's your best weapon but it takes tons of work and you use other weapons until you have it. The fact it's the only weapon kills it. Surprise!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why the heck not? Been SV for 6 years? Well I been a hunter for 10 and SV was just about melee before you came along. Hunters are not just about range. You can slap any hunter spec name on another hunter spec and it will still be the same as it is right now. If you dont want to melee, then play MM or BM. Im sure they will bake some of the SV skills into MM or BM in the next expac.</div></div><hr />

You actually quoted the very thing that made your first harassment utterly hilarious.<br />
<br />
So, come again?<br />
<br />
As for Legion: I'm still undecided. I'll not pre-order immediately as I did with WotLK, BC and MoP...but I will keep playing some WoW. We'll see how that unfolds.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, shit eaters who let companies fuck them and ask for more like a blind fanboy are.<br />
<br />
Take a look in the mirror to see one.<br />
<br />
This might surprise you, but maybe someone actually enjoys World of Warcraft right now, without being a &quot;shit eater&quot;. That's the thing about taste and opinion: The first one is always different, everyone has one of the second ones. Just because someone else likes what you don't doesn't mean he is a kiss up fanboy. I've been playing this game for ten years on an &quot;on/off&quot; basis. Some changes I saw were good, others were terrible. But I wouldn't call someone a &quot;shit eater&quot; for liking something I dislike.</div></div><hr />
