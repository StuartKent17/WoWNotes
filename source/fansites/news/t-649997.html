Itemization<br />
Int vs. Spirit<br />
You are rarely choosing between just Int and Spirit. It's also fine if you prefer Int to Spirit. The danger comes when you say &quot;My gear is junk because it has Spirit on it.&quot; That is what paladins are saying about MP5. Our stance is that's not a problem with the gear -- it's a problem with the stat not being attractive enough. We already run the risk of PvE gear being as homogenized and well, boring, as PvP gear. We need to use all of the stats we have available or every tier of healing plates is going to be &quot;Your previous tier, plus 10% more Int and Crit.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367597888-gc-im-sorry-but-youre-severely-misinformed.html))<br />
<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
<br />
Melee classes in 2v2 and 3v3 Arenas<br />
We have said we think certain melee classes are too good in 2s and 3s right now. &quot;Certain melee classes are too good in 2s and 3s right now&quot; does not equal &quot;burst is too high.&quot; Let's try and be precise. When players go around posting &quot;burst is too high&quot; then you get a lot of less-informed players also chanting &quot;burst is too high,&quot; when I really think that doesn't contribute much to the discussion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367758304-sad-dayi-must-battle-gcs-hypocrisy-again.html))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Overpowered talents<br />
No, it doesn't become irrelevant, at least in our minds. Here are a few of the problems you run into when some talents are enormously more powerful than others:<br />
<br />
1) The talents that &quot;only&quot; provide a 1 or 5% dps increase are viewed as garbage. Players might skip them. They might make the rest of the tree feel lame, which risks players not finding the tree very fun. Think about it this way: if your breastplate had 500 strength on it and your bracers had 10 strength on them, would you even care about the bracers? Would you campaign to get them buffed? Would you make &quot;Lol nobody cares about bracers&quot; posts.<br />
<br />
2) Other classes wonder why their 51 point talent can't provide such an enormous benefit. They think warriors are overly favored or that developers didn't spend much attention on their trees. Now, we ignore QQ as much as we can, but also ideally players are excited about their classes, and ignoring even a hint of favoritism can go a long way. Despite our best intentions, talents still have grown more and more powerful over time. Compare an old talent like Improved Heroic Strike to a new one like Fire and Brimstone. We want to keep the inflation under control while possible, or +10% becomes the new standard by which talents are measured.<br />
<br />
3) Power increase isn't constant. When you can suddenly get your 51 point talent, your dps shoots up enormously. A level 60 warrior could do much, much higher dps than a level 59 warrior.<br />
<br />
4) Here is the most important one. We thing the game works better when talents don't make up too large of a player's power allocation. It makes gear drop feel cruddy when so much of your power comes from talent allocation. It makes enchants, tradeskills, buffs and other parts of the game feel paltry by comparison because you are so powerful just by a passive increase to your talents. It means picking the &quot;wrong&quot; spec is brutal instead of just sub-optimal.<br />
<br />
Now there are other considerations of course. In the case for Hunger for Blood, we think having an overpowered talent is preferable to the alternative. There are talents like Ruin that provide an enormous dps increase and we live with that. (And to be fair, Titan's Grip is still overpowered even with the 10% penalty but it's less overpowered than without the penalty.) If we could find no other way to improve Fury dps, then I'm sure we'd look at TG. But there's a lot of the tree we can improve.

Frost Trap on immune targets<br />
Partially what we wanted to do was make sure it wasn't &quot;wasted&quot; on an immune target. It's hard to figure out the ideal solution here -- it seems like sometimes you'd want to trigger it anyway and sometimes you'd want to save it. I'm assuming you'd never want Freezing Trap to active on an immune target, so there's a consistency issue too.<br />
<br />
Reverting it back to always going off on immune targets and just not affecting that target certainly isn't off the table. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367978564-frost-trap-nerf-logic.html))<br />

Making Flash of Light useful again to &quot;fix&quot; MP5<br />
To be clear, we think that's a problem. When the toolbox isn't large, it's important that every tool does something. The solution is just a little tricky. Nerfing HL won't go over well, but buffing FoL just risks making paladins overpowered. To fix this, which we might do, we have to tweak carefully.

<br />
Mana regeneration and MP5<br />
We nerfed a lot of regen mechanics in between T7 and T8. Players were worried about regen being too low so we made sure the stats were there. It appears that players aren't having mana problems on the normal encounters but are having to be more careful on the hard modes. So we need to get some more hard mode data. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367597888-gc-im-sorry-but-youre-severely-misinformed.html))<br />
<br />
Changing game mechanics to make MP5 more wanted<br />
I'm convinced the best option for Blizzard to make MP5 matter would be to:<br />
Change Replenishment to restore mana every second based on your MP5. 1% of your casting MP5 returned per second.<br />
Change Illumination to restore mana on crits based on your MP5. 35% of your casting MP5 returned per HL crit, 20% per FoL/Shock crit. <br />
<br />
Yes. Changes like that would make MP5 more meaningful without removing potentially fun mechanics like Illumination or DP. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367597888-gc-im-sorry-but-youre-severely-misinformed.html))</div></div><hr />

Although hunters still have it rough, in 2v2 (having it good in 3v3 or 5v5 is not a good trade, seeing 2v2 is the most populated bracket and easyest to organize and play daily), it is nice to see that lately they are focusing alot on hunters. <br />
With attention come nerfs aswell, but them not forgeting about a certain class is something that gives that class hopes for a better tomorow.<br />

I love how Blizzard does this even though did you guys not notice we are useless for hard modes, as healers. Think Blizzard. And by the way think about the Priests and Druids. I am sure they can top meters and still have about exact same mana as I do at the end of the fight. That just ruins everything. GOING BACK TO FOL IS NOT FUN WHY BRING IT IN AGAIN..

I'm speechless.<br />
<br />
Even assuming that someone reaches 1500 casting MP5, with a 20k mana pool:<br />
<br />
Currently, replenishment gives 0.25% of your mana pool a second. Even with a severely low mana pool of 20k(By current holy standards):<br />
20000x0.25%= 50 mana.<br />
Holy light base cost: 1274.<br />
1274x60% = 764 mana.<br />
<br />
In comparison...<br />
1500x1%= 15.<br />
1500x35%= 525.<br />

<br />
I'll go ahead and take offense to that before somebody else does, <br />
just because the country has a few retards that think it's &quot;cool&quot; to pick a childish name like this and make the headlines with some bored stunt doesn't mean the whole country thinks alike.<br />

I'm convinced the best option for Blizzard to make MP5 matter would be to:<br />
Change Replenishment to restore mana every second based on your MP5. 1% of your casting MP5 returned per second.<br />
<br />
Yay for replenishment giving me 3 mana instead of 70.[/list]</div></div><hr />

when on top of him people dont take any damage. when they destroy his towers they jump off him and land on the ground with parachute. because he is stunned he isnt shooting any missiles. so basically those ppl have time to get into some machine without taking any dmg. the only way they can be killed is if FL's flame vents arent interrupted or if they jump without parachute</div></div><hr />

just because the country has a few retards that think it's &quot;cool&quot; to pick a childish name like this and make the headlines with some bored stunt doesn't mean the whole country thinks alike.<br />
<br />
Obviously there's plenty and then some americans, australians, and clueless 12 year old kids in every other country of the world that have the exact same PROBLEM with the cells in their brain. Your seemingly narrow view of the world alone is likely a testimony of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off I'll give you one thing: adding the word 'Dutch' was indeed redundant, since this is a global wide 'problem'. But I like keeping my fellow countrymen on their toes. Makes me feel.. 'productive'*. <br />
* - (A whole lot less bored)<br />
<br />
Secondly, my statement applies to things far beyond picking childish avatar names or bored stunts.. there's a reason why i.e. a certain Dutch show business couple has been successfully in 'the news' for over a week now. I'm fairly certain you, and other people capable of critical thinking, can think of many more layers which I could be referring too.<br />
<br />
Sadly, boredom kills this trade of skill. It even has killed mine: my view of the world is ruined by a melancholic form of misanthropy, leaving me a old, bitter, bored and cynical young man.<br />

Honestly if you lived in either of the opposites, you'd find out this discussion only exists commonly on the internet. Fact is, there's barely any difference. Placing a title on any whole country or continent is incredibly ignorant and false. The only complaint I hear in real life when I travel outside of the states is rarely &quot;you Americans are always trying to police the world&quot; -- That's not us, that's our shit-hole of a government for you. And the only country in Europe (And i've spent quite a time in a number of them) where i'd actually think the government spreads propaganda against Americans is France -- (No offense to any French people, I just happened to have had a few bad experiences there simply because i'm a citizen of the US)<br />

In all honesty, and I know this little tiny post won't go anywhere.. In real life do any of you actually commonly joke or speak harshly about America or Europe?

They start with 2 vehicles. Once the main vehicle starts moving, the 2nd guy bales and hops into that one. The second person is a mage...so he can ranged kill both towers.<br />

The only credit I'll give you on this one is indeed playing on a EU server =/= Europeon necessarily, so I suppose I did assume there. <br />

If there was a legitamate reason for such a post, then I regret my anger. If not, I regret nothing. As of right now, I fail to see any good reasoning behind such a post except to try and troll. <br />
<br />
As for fellow Americans making those kind of statements, frankly, they're complete idiots. I won't defend stupid people.

3. Retri pallys. I dont know if u guys at blizzard even play this game, but if u put a resto druid and a retri pally together in 2v2, u cant do a damn thing. Maybe thats why most of the high teams is that setup. Maybe u should actually try play this game before u buffing classes. <br />

What the holy fuck, Blizzard? Not taking the fun away from the class? You are just nerfing the fun to the ground.<br />
<br />
Ret or Prot now?<br />

Yeah, nerfing healers is bad... there isn't enough healers in the game in the first place and making them not want to be healers anymore is a super bad idea.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Panman</div><div class="date">2009-05-27, 01:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand you to want Mp5 to be a sought after stat. Changing illumination is way to extream . Alot of us have geared ourselves for crit to help us with mana regen. Making it now, we have to go back and regear to be once again effective. And as far as people saying pallys are the bottom of the barrel for healing isnt true. Meters dont say everything. A pally healer is a great way to help with the burst dmg on a tank, but having that holy light cast isnt always gonna be effectivie healing(due to blocks, parry, dodges ect), but very useful. This also touches on my other point. Some pally healers can go for more of a raid heal build, such as a Mp5/SP and use flash and shock on the raid(HL is a little to slow to keep up with druids and priests raid heals). The others go for more of a haste/Crit to be more of an effective MT healer. If you take away the current way illumination works it will completely make this job ineffiant. I do think the replenishment idea is viable because if you are relying to much on replenishment in either build you need to work on Mp5. Anyways sorry for the long post, just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

This is just... Seriously, what do you want to achieve with this? From my pov your just rerolling something else because your class gets nerfed:p Stick with it and Soon it will get buffed if needed.<br />
<br />
(Gratz to the 2 dutches) the Discussion on this post is seriously stupid:P they did a good work^^</div></div><hr />

What do I want to achiev? Fun, maybe? Wait for a buffed if needed? Holy paladins are getting nerfed and nerfed for a long time now, they want to destroy the only diferent healer that we have. Some people don't like healing because the spirit/mp5 regen, waiting and not casting anything (not playing, or doing any actions) isn't fun, IMO. That's why I like paladins, and they are going to destroy it making us use mp5. Class balance can be cool, but when it's destroying everything special in the game it's just stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Warlocks: They do more dmg than mages, they have dots, and loads of fear. They can easily burst for 15 k when ur feared and there pet can spel lock u even u silence the lock Gj :S. How do u even imagine that is balanced? <br />
<br />
2. Resto Druids. Where should i start? As pretty much every class, if the druid got to much resi and + healing. U cant kill him. when finally hes oom. then inervate and hes full on mana in 2 sec. They can cyclone, The only cc u cant dispel, break out or anything. Again how do u think thats ballanced?<br />
<br />
3. Retri pallys. I dont know if u guys at blizzard even play this game, but if u put a resto druid and a retri pally together in 2v2, u cant do a damn thing. Maybe thats why most of the high teams is that setup. Maybe u should actually try play this game before u buffing classes. <br />

So you don't even manage to get this into the right thread the first time...AND you seem to think that the artists for this game are the ones balancing PVP...I feel sorry for you mate...</div></div><hr />

Just because people hate Paris Hilton, it doesn't mean that they are jealous of the vapid little whore. Just because someone doesn't like something, it doesn't mean that they secretly want to be/do those things. That point is soooo played out, come out with something new.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why would anyone hate Paris Hilton without knowing her? Personally, I really enjoyed some of the things she did... But I am in fact jealous of her, for being born into such a wealthy family. She has all the money in the world without ever having to work for it. But that's no reason to hate her, she's just one of the luckier persons on this planet...</div></div><hr />
