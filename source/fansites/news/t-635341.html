PTR 3.1.0 Character Copy now available<br />
Nothing is official yet, but both european and american PTR Copy pages are now online and the amount of copies available has been reset. Even if it's not officialy 3.1.0 yet. I suggest that you copy your characters while you can because 3.1.0 is coming ... very soon?<br />

Depends on what you mean with frozen. If you just cancelled two days ago you might be able to access the PTR. If by frozen you mean you cannot login to the live servers then you will out of luck.</div></div><hr />

The US ones we're up a few days ago and I tried to copy my characters over and all in a sudden they went down so I understand the &quot; they have been up and down the past few days&quot;.<br />

<br />
Those are names of bosses in Ulduar, that is being released with 3.1, so once the raid is on PTR they will put all the other changes they have ready for 3.1 in the PTR also. The bosses are being done at certain times, so 3.1 will prob come on the PTR, then they will release the schedule for the raid bosses, then the first phase og boss testing will start 1 or 2 days after the initial opening of the PTR</div></div><hr />

<br />
Freya, Thorim, Hodir and The Iron Council are a part of the 3.1 content patch. If they're being tested on the PTR, then naturally the PTR is 3.1 - 'cause that's how PTR's work, a work in progress.<br />
<br />
Me, I'm hoping that the character copy page will be reset when the first PTR patch is made available, hopefully alongside with some PROPER realms. (Yes, solely PvP realms for mostly PvE content makes perfect sense.. not.)</div></div><hr />

My PTR page now says 0 available copies, 1 hour wait, and all my pendings (I copied at 1-2 days wait time) are gone.</div></div><hr />

So anyone copying to the EU PTR now (at &quot;9 days&quot;) will be waiting a week, not a day. I guess this is Blizzard's way of managing populations.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which; there was a comment (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=8136833916&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=2) from Zemme in Ensidia that Blizzard now copy their accounts over beforehand.</div></div><hr />

Went from 2 in queue that I did this afternoon to none and 4 available again.</div></div><hr />

Don't waste your time. The queue keeps increasing in time because NONE of the copies are going through. This is because the PTR copies are not ready yet and when they are, guess what, everyone will have to redo it.<br />
<br />
So don't waste your time, it's an unintended bug. And don't give me the old news crap, there are several blue posts that are more recent still saying PTR copies are not ready yet.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justasooner</div><div class="date">2009-02-22, 11:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess mister ego told you meroko. LOL<br />
<br />
Don't worry, it'll be hilarious to see everything get reset when they actually load and announce the PTR publicly and spit on those who seems to like refreshing blizz pages ever 2 minutes to be the first to post any news (even when the news isn't ready yet and they are actually doing more harm than good).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justasooner</div><div class="date">2009-02-23, 12:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sigh. I love teenagers. I really do, bless their hearts.<br />
<br />
By official announcement, I'm saying the post that will be &quot;PTR has arrived and it is now open for downloads and character transfers.&quot; Did you read a blue anywhere that said character transfers were officially open?</div></div><hr />

Or it will show the game time expired error? First time i'd really want to test something before hitting live :o<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember a long time ago,, i used to use 10-day trial accounts to log on to the PTR. i dunno if that answers your question though</div></div><hr />

After about 10 minutes it went into lockdown again. Hope this means good things for the PTR. :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deionara</div><div class="date">2009-02-25, 04:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the wow PTR character copy page, the part that shows how many days queue their is to copy a character, when i click the &quot;copy character&quot; button i get a &quot;error on page&quot; message. <br />
<br />
What is supposed to happen ? I would assume im supposed to get placed in the queue to make a character on the ptr's ?<br />
<br />
I have tried mozilla and IE with java uninstalled and installed.</div></div><hr />
