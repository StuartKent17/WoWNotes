WWI Splash Screen - Day 3<br />
The splash screen on Blizzard.com (http://www.blizzard.com) has been updated once again. It's definitely looking more and more icy ... This time a rune from Starcraft 2 appeared, and it looks like Blizzard decided to add a few things from each one of their game just to let you theorycraft before the WWI. (Note : It's Diablo 3, seriously)<br />

PTR 2.4.3 - Premade Characters Available<br />
Premade characters are now available on PTRs, but you'll probably have to wait a few days before you can get a character copied. <br />
The problems with Pre-made characters have been resolved, they should no longer be failing.<br />
<br />
The character copy queue is now full and copies are taking multiple days to complete. Please be patient. <br />
<br />
<br />
PTR 2.4.3 - Brewfest testing<br />
We've made some changes to Brewfest this year, and we're testing it out on the PTR. We have a few things in particular we'd like you to test when the holiday is active:<br />
<br />
The Dark Iron Attack is back this year, every half-hour at the main Brewfest camps outside of Orgrimmar and Ironforge. Please test out the attack and give us your feedback on how it plays out.<br />
<br />
There is a new boss in Blackrock Depths to test -- Coren Direbrew, who is located in the Grim Guzzler. The mole machine directly to the right as you zone in should transport you to the Grim Guzzler. No need to clear all the way up there<br />
The revamped brewfest is now available on PTRs, some additions have been made including a new event Headless Horseman/Ahune-like boss named Coren Direbrew (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/brd.jpg). You can get 4 epic trinkets from him, and an upgraded version of good old Barman Shanker !<br />
<br />
Coren Direbrew Loot Table<br />

&lt;font color=&quot;#A335EE&quot;&gt;Coren's Lucky Coin&lt;/font&gt; (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/brewfest_trinkets.jpg) (<br />

WH (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=37597))<br />
<br />
Also, a few more items have been discovered on PTRs (http://www.wowhead.com/?latest=additions). Also, alliance players won't get the Kodo mount like the Horde did with the Ram mount last year, sorry. <br />
The decision was made to give Horde the Kodo and Alliance the Ram this year. I apologize if there were expectations that the Alliance would get a Horde mount; we were in discussions about this for a long time. I hope that you'll enjoy the holiday regardless. <br />

Arena Season 4 Begins<br />
The Season 4 is now available on both european and american realms !<br />
Arena Season 4 has now officially begun, and players can immediately begin competing for the new Brutal Gladiator and Guardian PvP item sets. Players will now also be able to purchase Arena Season 2 items using the honor system. Please note that we have reset all Arena team and personal ratings, though players retain their Arena points and teams. The team and personal rating have simply been reset to the default 1500, allowing all teams to once again compete for top honors with a fresh start. Also, with the end of the third season, players on the top teams from each battlegroup will be receiving their end-of-season rewards approximately one week from today. These include Arena-specific titles that they can display proudly until the end of the new season, and, for the best of the best, an Armored Nether Drake.<br />
<br />
It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for the Arena-specific title and/or Armored Nether Drake to refrain from transferring their character to another realm between now and when these end-of-season rewards are physically awarded, otherwise they will become ineligible to receive either. <br />
<br />

Death Knight Tanking<br />
That said, the Deathknight will be able to tank things, we have talked about them having abilities that help them tank casters, but that doesn't automatically mean they are limited to 5 person dungeons or caster-specific encounters. It may be awhile for some players to learn how to play a whole new class and level them up, but the option will likely be available to players/raid groups to have Deathknights tank a large number of encounters.

Frostmourne Fan Art Contest Closed<br />
The submission period for the Frostmourne Fan Art Contest has now completed. This contest generated a great response from the community, and we’re working through all of the fantastic submissions we received. We’ll be announcing the winners in the coming weeks, so keep an eye on the website. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=7475657680&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#0))<br />

Epic Tabards added as UDE Points rewards<br />
For the first time since the launch of the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, The Upper Deck Entertainment (UDE) Points Store will be expanding its World of Warcraft In-Game item offering, with six new tabards! Each tabard will feature a different colored variant of the Black Flame logo featured on the back of World of Warcraft Trading Card Game cards. <br />
<br />
Starting after Blizzard’s 2.4.3 patch, the UDE Points Store will roll out these new tabards. Players will be able to match their love of the Trading Card Game with their in-game fashion sense, since the six new tabards will offer something to go with just about any set of Armor!<br />
<br />
The <br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#A335EE&quot;&gt;[Tabard of Nature]&lt;/font&gt; (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/tabardofnature.jpg) will be green; the <br />

&lt;font color=&quot;#A335EE&quot;&gt;[Tabard of the Void]&lt;/font&gt; (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/tabardofthevoid.jpg), black; the <br />

&lt;font color=&quot;#A335EE&quot;&gt;[Tabard of Fury]&lt;/font&gt; (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/tabardoffury.jpg), yellow; and the <br />
&lt;font color=&quot;#A335EE&quot;&gt;[Tabard of the Defender]&lt;/font&gt; (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/june/tabardofthedefender.jpg), orange. <br />
<br />
Each of the tabards will be made available in the coming months, so stay tuned to WoWTCG.com (http://www.wowtcg.com) for more information!.<br />

It is stuff like the evolving seasonal events, that keeps oldschool players around.<br />
<br />
We know the game is flawed and the developers appear to be biased towards horde often, but this is an outright bad decision.<br />
<br />
People that have been around since day one will NOT go an grind out some dancing flaming draenei statue or a whacko dress to clot up their bank space even more.<br />
<br />
The brewfest mount was the only really unique thing and worth getting by repeatedly grinding out those 600 tokens during the event.<br />
<br />
If I wasn't caught up in work right now, I would go campaign for boycotting brewfest altogether. It simply is a completely uncalled for decision with no understandable reasoning involved.<br />

Hmmm somewhere I have a some screenies of a gnome on a kodo (we'll it's a tauren with a gnome skin tho), can digg it up if you like :).<br />
<br />
It's a kinda odd action from Blizz. Since we have your ram mount, why not give you our kodo? Personaly I allways love to see someone ride a mount from the opposite faction :). (1 reason for that is cause it's rare a seccond cause it looks cool.)</div></div><hr />

This is far from the view you get if you play world PvP or AV as Horde. You got any idea how much better built your cities, outposts, and fortresses are from a game balance perspective?<br />

P.S. Can't find a matching rune among the Diablo 2 runes, so there's that theory down the drain ^^<br />

Im not saying its Diablo but everything points to it, considering blizzard has three franchises and we have allready seen things in development for two of them, that and we know they have been developing a game since 05 with the code name Hydra.<br />
<br />
then as icing on the cake:<br />
A GAME ANNOUNCEMENT has been Confirmed! Rob Pardo told GameIndustry.biz at the GDC the following:<br />
<br />
&quot;So you want me to announce the game before our announcement?&quot; he said. &quot;No offense, but I think there's like 300 people here, and I'll be ripped apart by 8000 people there [at the Invitational] if I pre-announce it - but it's going to be really exciting. I think everybody here will be really excited about the announcement.&quot;<br />
(courtasy of Blizzplanet.com)<br />
<br />
there is only one real explaination as to what Hydra can be and we will see it on saturday, and im 98% sure its Diablo</div></div><hr />

Seeing as last year everyone got rams including the horde and the alliance players kicked up a fuss about it saying &quot;we want a horde mount&quot;. So then you see kodo and think oh that would be cool and then they make it horde only.... oh well another holiday quest i wont bother doing for a reskinned ram.<br />
<br />
On another note people seem to have not noticed the mage + lock changes. The lock change is fair enough but imo the mage change will be very overpowered especially for people trying to get near a frost mage.</div></div><hr />

You already have access to mounts that Horde cannot get (the winterspring sabre), you have access to a passive pet through a quest chain that horde cannot do and have no equivalent pet/quest chain (&quot;Becoming a parent&quot; - get the multicoloured whelp thing - like the ones near the horde camp in Feralas). You get the item to transform you into a Furbolg - of which there is no horde equivalent.<br />

I've been hearing you guys QQ about the game long enough. From what Blizzard has done in the past<br />
and what I believe the company is doing now, is announcing the official release date for WOTLK and the cinematic trailer. This is about the same time when they were in alpha when they did the same with BC. Why would they have ice and then make it Diablo? Melt the ice into fire and it turns into Hell? Give me a break. Blizzard has WOTLK and SC2 on their hands, if you expect those two games to be any good you wouldn't want them to make a Diablo 3 at the same time. <br />
<br />
With a company like Blizz, they want to spread out what they have, not throw it all into a pot and say, okay pick which one you want and burn yourself out.<br />
They rather own your soul for years than have you crap you pants in excitement for just one.<br />
<br />
My prediction: Announcement of WOTLK release date and cinematic video!<br />
<br />
PS, companies who buy a website that says diablo3.com doesn't mean they have a game ready to slap on it. Just means they're definitely planning to do make one. Could be months, years.</div></div><hr />

So thats why you guys have Winterspring Sabers but Blizzard removed the Ravasaur trainers for horde right. Thats why a Raptor mount, Undead Horse mount, and a Hawkstrider mount all drop for you and only a Tiger mount drops for us. Obviously this is so Horde favored right now. So where is my Ravasaur, Horse, and Elekk mounts at to make stuff even and not I dunno Alliance favored for once...</div></div><hr />

Yup and you see alliance on undead horses or raptors everywhere right? Those drops are so rare (especially baron) that you cant count them in. I can imagine You would really QQ if alliance got kodo last time and you had no possibility to get ram.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't get why shamans are singled out though? <br />
Priests / hunters /warlocks usually dispell stuff too?<br />
I guess for warlocks and hunters it is a bit different because of the cooldown, but on those classes I usually try to dispell that shield too.<br />
<br />
And I feel that mages and locks are balanced around always having these buffs up. So if they didn't get this they might get some other stuff to make up for it.<br />
<br />
ps. I do feel that every class and spec should by just as viable as the other, even though it is impossible to at least try that. Thus for example buff enhancement shammies, shadowpriests, ferals, moonkins etc. so they are just as viable as the rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, you can have mechno-strider. Not that any of the horde races would be able to ride one, but sure, have it.<br />
<br />
Wish horde would stop saying we have access to nearly all their mounts, Baron's deathcharger is extremely rare, so is the raptor, and there's only a handful of white hawkstriders on my server. Oh noes,, all alliance are riding them, our sweet horde circle jerking pride is being tarnished ;___;<br />
<br />
At least you could 100% get one our mounts, and you can buy the hippogryth. Just find it hilarious that horde are making fun of alliance for not getting a kodo, when you can't get rams anymore, neither can your alts or your friends.<br />

<br />
Here it is:<br />
<br />
You know this famous image of Diablo? Done by Michael Dashow. His Homepage has a Walross as a Logo, its his &quot;Icon&quot; if you will.<br />
Now look at this, if one compares that secretly hidden image at the splash-screen with his logo (as he was the leading artist of diablo) one suddenly sees this:<br />

<br />
Interesting huh? I think it is quite clear now.<br />

Another interesting bit of information:<br />

<br />
Don't bet you money on that...<br />
<br />
What would be the sense of: <br />
<br />
1- launching another warcraft game when they are launching a new expansion for wow...<br />
2- launching another strategy game when they are launching Starcraft 2<br />
<br />
Its clearly a new game, maybe on the the 3 ideas:<br />
1 - the so called next gen MMO that will replace WOW or take the PVP fans...<br />
2 - totally new game different form everything we've seen on blizz<br />
3 - Diablo 3 in the same Diablo style...<br />
<br />
For me I'd bet on a new MMO based on Diablo...<br />
<br />
<br />
Now a quote from a guy in another site:<br />
<br />
Of course Blizzard is teasing us, hence the ice and symbols from Warcraft/Starcraft. They have to throw us off somehow because there is just so much evidence that Diablo 3 will be announced:<br />
<br />
1. Job postings for Diablo universe<br />
2. Diablo3.com domain takeover. Diablo3.de, diablo3.fr, diablo3.es, etc registered.<br />
3. WWI on Diablo's B-day<br />
4. Blizzard has stated team &quot;3&quot; working on a game.<br />
5. Gaming Steve states that Diablo 3 is in development (AKA Beezlebub 3)<br />
6. Xfire leaks game announcement.<br />
7. PCAction's statement &quot;Even if the hell froze and cows gave beer - we would spill nothig out!&quot; and delayed follow-up until after WWI.<br />
8. New Diablo WWI art depicts a much larger Diablo that is centered between characters from warcraft/starcraft.<br />
9. the master.css file from Blizzard.com hints at ACT 5 areas of D2: LoD<br />
10. Age restriction for those at WWI.<br />
11. Additional hall needed at WWI<br />
12. Peterconcept.com has &quot;Project Hydra&quot; coming soon then changes to &quot;Shut down until 6.28.08&quot;<br />
13. D2 Patch 1.12 no-cd patch released; just like before Starcraft 2 was announced.<br />
14. Richard A. Knaak says he isn't writing for a &quot;dead game&quot;<br />
15. Phil Cook, voice of Deckard Cain, says &quot;As for Diablo 3...I can neither confirm nor deny anything, under threat of torture and poisoning at the hands of Andariel...who may or may not return in...never mind.&quot;<br />
16. Diablo trademark activity.<br />
17. Blizzard has a splash image displaying all 3 worlds: Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo. Similar to last years timeline that showed all universes. Diablo and Warcraft games were shown in the timeline with Starcraft yet SC2 was announced!<br />
18. Rob Pardo confirms game announcement: &quot;So you want me to announce the game before our announcement?&quot; he said. &quot;No offense, but I think there's like 300 people here, and I'll be ripped apart by 8000 people there [at the Invitational] if I pre-announce it - but it's going to be really exciting. I think everybody here will be really excited about the announcement.&quot;<br />
19. Many many other hints that I'm sure I am forgetting...<br />
<br />
If you still have doubts or believe the announcment to be a SC/WC related game then please state the hints/leaks/evidence of such a game and then compare to this list. If there is anytime to announce D3 IT IS NOW!<br />
<br />
EN GUARDE! THE MINIONS OF HELL HATH RETURNED!</div></div><hr />

Ha ha ha ha ha! Awesome. Even if Diablo 3 isn't the next project, I do have to say that at least, that quote is awesome.<br />
<br />
As for the chances of it being Diablo 3, I say the chances are good. I can recall three earlier times where Blizzard did a 'slow reveal' on their main page; the first was for WoW [original], the second was for Starcraft: Ghost, and the third was for Starcraft 2. Therefore, I think that whatever is coming, it wil NOT be WotLK related, since that would not be a 'new' project. Also, the End of Diablo 2 happened to be in a frozen tundra, so it could make sense that ice is featured. So my personal guess will be something Diablo related.</div></div><hr />

That way they aren't cutting into their current userbase with Warcraft and are carving a chunk out of the console gamers from other companies.<br />
Werent they discussing developers for next gen consoles a year or two ago?</div></div><hr />

You fail, the 3rd rune is for SC. <br />
<br />
Does it hurt to just read what people posted beforehand to figure this out?<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't see that post before. if you look at times posted its like 30 secs after.<br />

What would be the sense of: <br />
<br />
1- launching another warcraft game when they are launching a new expansion for wow...<br />
2- launching another strategy game when they are launching Starcraft 2<br />
<br />
Its clearly a new game, maybe on the the 3 ideas:<br />
1 - the so called next gen MMO that will replace WOW or take the PVP fans...<br />
2 - totally new game different form everything we've seen on blizz<br />
3 - Diablo 3 in the same Diablo style...<br />
<br />
For me I'd bet on a new MMO based on Diablo...<br />
<br />

I trust Kody immensely, the dude wouldn't BS this. So it is, in fact, not WLK or SC2.<br />
EditL DJ beat me to the punch, though =(<br />

Edit2: Call me slow, but that's not a head in the top left iamge, it's a shoulder. The right side is the back, like a cloak. But what would be wearing purple furs?</div></div><hr />

Look at the ice underneath Arthas<br />
Now look at the ice on the splash:<br />
http://www.blizzard.com/us/splash.html<br />
<br />
Very similar. The ice under Arthas also has etches and runes carved in it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except for the part where the five vertices of a pentagram are equidistant from each other... which the runes are not. So, no, it will not be a pentagram.</div></div><hr />

The single best piece of news regarding mages in a while. It's seriously annoying going up against a retarded purge-happy shaman who purges all your buffs just to hit you with a suped up attack. Just be glad its the armors and not everything else lol. Now about the Brewfest issue I wish we got the rams again I missed out on them but oh well these Kodos look cool. Favoritism toward the horde...hardly the Alliance Have an almost guaranteed win in a BG all the time with AV and although a rather slim chance you do still have acess to Baron's mount, the raptor, and now the hawkstrider. QQ for the love of Jeebus.</div></div><hr />
