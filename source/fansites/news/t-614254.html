Account Wide - Level scaled items<br />
A new type of items has been added to the game. <br />
These items are Bind To Account items, you can transfer them between characters !<br />
These items scale with level, a level 1 character can perfectly use it and stats will scale accordingly !<br />

Shoulders will also increase your experience gain from killing monster by 10%<br />

the armor has +10% exp bonus from killing monsters on it ,and they all say &quot;required level 1 to 80 (80)&quot; when their being looked at by a lev 80 char, the stats on them are scaled to person wearing/looking at item<br />
<br />
the dagger was 120dps at 80,so they arent scaled to be incredibly powerful, possibly like blues<br />
their bind line says &quot;binds to account&quot;<br />
<br />
so its something to spend badges on once you are done buying stuff for the toon w/ badges,and your still earning them like crazy</div></div><hr />

Twinks - was my second... These items will fit perfectly for 19th level, as they are approximately blue quality tuned for whatever level you want. It will be way easier to make a twink (never depend on rare drops), but even harder for non-twinky characters in low BG brackets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep,. it really depends how much they make it scale though, what sort of relative ilvl are we thinking of.<br />
Perhaps it's scaled to be equal to green items, so that any blues and epics you find on your way will still be better for a short while. <br />
<br />
If these BtA (Bound to Account - not Bind on Acquire) items can be enchanted with lvl 80 enchants though, hah, you'll still not use much other gear.</div></div><hr />

FYI : Steady shot has been changed in such a way that it benefits from haste without clipping shots.</div></div><hr />

Not before after lvl 40 - its still mail item at lvl 1.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rilgon</div><div class="date">2008-09-11, 09:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">3/3 Surefooted, much ?Not in every spec much?<br />
<br />
And even WITH 3/3 Surefooted AND Inspiring Presence (just to give you as much of an edge as I can give you), you still need 164 Hit Rating to be hit-capped - more than you need on Live WITHOUT any bonuses.<br />
<br />
Assuming that you take 4/5 of the Hunter set (and the only thing with hit on that is the chest), the new helm from the 25-man Obsidian Sanctum run, and stuff from Naxx 10 (since we don't have a good list of Naxx 25 loot), you're STILL hard-pressed to hit 5% hit, much less the 9% you need to raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes, bbr, you are correct. However, once your Steady Shot is at 1.5 seconds or faster, Haste becomes terribly redundant and only affects Auto-Shot damage. Between quiver haste (15%) and Windfury Totem (20%), you're ALREADY at the point where Haste rating is moot for your Steady Shots. And with as expensive for item budgeting as Haste is, I'd much rather have more Ranged Attack Power, some actual Hit Rating, some more Crit Rating, or SOMETHING besides Haste Rating.</div></div><hr />

My ideal BOA situation is being in a heroic or a 10man and having an item no one could use but then everyone having an alt, So we all roll then the winner could send that item to an alt. All this BOA is about is being 80 getting new badges of justice(or what ever the name is) and then just sending those items to an alt. Weakkk sauce</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah thats the other question that needs answering (the first being enchants), will the item type scale also with level, so plate becomes mail under lvl 40 and mail becomes leather under lvl 40?</div></div><hr />

OMG a new color of items :o , (and in the artifacts color too) -- what is the view on how their stats match up to epics??<br />

EDIT: Ok after the euphoria of seeing a new item color, now i am thinking why have gear that never gets replaced? I would assume it must be tuned to a lower ilvl because otherwise it interferes with progression.</div></div><hr />

Well, you dont know yet if you can enchant these items.<br />
ItemLevel stays at 1 (as far as I remember), so you will not be able to apply enchants which require a level higher than 1.</div></div><hr />

PreBC enchants are still available, you know that right? And they have no level requirement. Alas, another expansion goes by and the price on Greater Eternal Essences will still be %^#*ing ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, IF certain items wont scale with armor class (read alot of non spi leather from pre40 to mail at 40, and mail to plate at 40) then the idea fails. however it will be great, i no longer have to farm raids with multiple chars, 1 will be enough and i will gear my other toons, whi will be stuck at 70, so they will level faster and make more money, since they will be able to sell/DE everything on the way</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peacemoon</div><div class="date">2008-09-11, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Few points for people:<br />
<br />
To get the scaling, bound to account items you need to use raid badges. I'm assuming these are the new version of badges of justice? If so, it gives you a good reason to raid on your main, so that you can use the badges to gear up your alt.<br />
<br />
However if my understanding is correct, then the same badges used for this can also buy normal upgrades. So aslong as your main has upgrades, you'll probably wish to use your badges on those until he has outgrown badge gear.<br />
<br />
This is a good idea for raiders, it means guild leaders wont have such a hard time trying to get people to help out on raids now that they can use their badges to gear up alts.<br />
<br />
<br />
For people who fear you could fully gear an alt and thus have no need for any item upgrades, may I point out<br />
1, Seems like you can only purchase weapons, shoulders and trinkets. Leaving all other slots open to normal items.<br />
2, By the time you get enough badges to gear up your alt with a weapon, shoulder and trinket, he should be high level anyway. :D<br />
<br />
This is a fun change, and good to see some of the &quot;good old&quot; items returning for another bout. My only worry? Why do they all have to be so evil looking, some of us prefer the holy, righteous look to the gothic skulls on my priest look. :)</div></div><hr />

Why would anybody really care? It's just a game. If a PvE player joins a PvP server, they are up for a surprise I think since judging by the feedback on the forums, pvp'ers are these hardcore people who could kill off a gang of pve'rs in pvp blindfolded. Free HK for them. <br />
(I've only leveled a couple of characters on a pvp server, and the only pvp I did see there, was ?? level enemies one shotting me)<br />
<br />
On topic: These Bind on Account, I wonder if Blizz will add special unique-type drops to the BoA.. I know I'd love to be able to find something really really rare and give it to other characters if I decide to switch..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy - Good single target healer, but more healing utility. Intended to be the AOE healer, or the healer than can react to any situation. Only spec of a class that has an on demand HoT, AOE, Lightwell which players can click to heal themselves, a flash heal, a large greater heal. <br />

Shadow - Obviously a single target sustained DPS, with Mind Sear now should be one of the strongest AOE classes. <br />

The Dal'Rend set is a reference to the Diablo II Barbarian sword set Bul'Kathos' Children, which are Bul'kathos' Sacred Charge and Bul'Kathos' Tribal Guardian. Do a little more research, son. It's not the first time Blizzard has used the WoW universe to pay homage to its prior games.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grayson Carlyle</div><div class="date">2008-09-11, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, the Dal'Rend's set is homage, but this is not the set, is it? It's an exact model and name duplication (albeit adding a prefix) to Dal'Rend's main hand. It's a tribute to Dal'Rend's set, whereas Dal'Rend's set was a tribute to Bul Kathos' Children. To say that the new weapon is a direct reference to Diablo II is incorrect. Bring some intelligence next time.<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;Diablo 2 ftw.&quot; would've been appropriate back in Classic WoW.</div></div><hr />

Horde thrives on PvP servers, but struggles population-wise elsewhere. This will give the Horde on smaller pop servers a way out, and in the process further destroy the Horde that's left behind.<br />
<br />
On the other side, it may allow a lot of raiders to switch to PvE servers and enjoy PvE without being ganked. I know they can already do this, but now knowing you can go back when you want to, it wouldn't be a one way trip. Gives more food for thought.</div></div><hr />

These (as you know) are Bound to account, which means you can mail them to any character on the same realm. They also scale with level. So you can mail these to a level one character and it will have appropriate stats (although slightly uber) for about 10 levels and then the item scales in power again, all the way up to how you're seeing it now. <br />
<br />
We're also going to add some Bind on Account non-scaling items for higher level alts. in the future. <br />
<br />
something i noted about legacy items:<br />
<br />
They are only updated every 10 levels.. (check bolded part). so i dont think they will be very viable to twinks<br />
<br />
ie: 1-9 same stats. 10-19 same stats, 20-29 same stats. <br />

Ive seen the same shoulder model for every class, and the season 5 (if that's actually what it looks like) looks like ass. Are they running out of ideas? ???<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe they should hire you so you can fix every models in 1 day meanwhile you work on the rest of wotlk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm assuming it's because Tier 7 is a recoloring of the Tier 3 models, and Deathknights weren't around back in the original Naxx days. In other words, they have to have a totally new set designed for them, rather than recolor an existing set.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of Blizzard recycling all their gear and would like additional variety, but I'm cutting them slack in this case because it is still Naxx and makes sense to drop the same looking gear that it always has dropped.</div></div><hr />

I'm aware of that. What I am asking is if T7 exists yet for the DK, and if so, are there stats for it somewhere?</div></div><hr />

<br />
PVP and PVE sets have different models in WOTLK. If sets are sharing models with PVE gear, it's almost certainly a placeholder.<br />
<br />
See the warrior gladiator set for an example of a unique model.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Armageddon - somehow looks odd, kinda like a weapon from stone age <br />
Inevitable Defeat - Nice idea, very Sci-Fi like<br />
The Jawbone - Now we are talking :)</div></div><hr />

WTF is going on with the trinket slots? Im kind of depressed there is a lack of trinkets there. I understand theres still items NYI, but at least a place holder or something to whet my appetite!</div></div><hr />
