Blue Tweets<br />
can u confirm how many guidlies need to be in a raid for it to count as a &quot;guild group&quot;? thanks<br />
For a raid group, 80% (rounded down) of the group must be from the same guild. Minimap icon will confirm if you qualify. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/647208814580596736))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
can you list the projects you personally worked on so we can lay to rest whether this post employment praise is warranted?<br />
I don't think that would lay anything to rest. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647202708580003840))<br />
The truth is that nobody works on projects in a vacuum at Blizzard or Riot. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647202842952859649))<br />
Nobody changes philosophy on their own. Those are all directions that the team is aligned around. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647202965745348608))<br />
It is why I always caution players not to vilify (or deify) individual developers. That's just not the way game dev works. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647203091188613120))<br />
If you don't like a feature or a philosophy by all means speak out. But blame the studio not those few whose names you know. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647203273607286784))<br />

Community Spotlight: SulaMoon<br />
This week, we turn our attention to the wondrous art of SulaMoon, who recently answered our questions about her creative process and what inspires her work. <br />
<br />
Q: What influences your designs?<br />
This whole [Warcraft] series started because Cataclysm was such a cool looking spell that I just had to paint it. Casting it while glyphed in demon form, with horns and wings? Heck yeah! So I started sketching.<br />
<br />
Pretty soon I had the idea to see if I could fit my character and my friend's character into a series, making them into Hearthstone-style illustrations. The first one was my demon warlock, followed by my husband's retribution paladin. The priest is the leader of the guild, and a dear friend, so it was a gift for her.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/september/thumb/sula01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/september/sula01.jpg) <br />
<br />
My idea is was to make their characters, favorite transmog set, and favorite spec all into one recognizable image. Raiding with them has been an awesome experience, so cheers! That’s also why they’re only Horde characters.<br />
<br />
Q: How long does it take to create images like these?<br />
I worked on this on my off-time, so I slip in a couple of minutes every chance I get. If I'd add it all up, it would be around 15 hours per piece.<br />
<br />
I start with a rough sketch for pose and composition—the overall posture of the piece. Once that’s working, I move into adding the details to the sketch—where I'll collect references for armor, weapons, and spell effects—and add them over the initial sketch. A couple of times something breaks and I need to reorganize the whole sketch. I then do a grayscale pass to make sure the light will read and start working on volumes, and then I can move into color. There’s a lot of polishing and making sure the materials read as they should.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This is also the time where I’ll take some liberties with the original set, and imagine how they would work if there weren’t in-game technical restrictions. I particularly like painting shiny trinkets, so a lot of time is spent on highlights and sparkling effects.<br />
<br />
Q: What other works inspire you?<br />
In the illustration world, Joe Madureira—his comic art but specially his work on Darksiders—and Brom is also a huge one for me, and so is Drew Struzan! I also like Todd Lockwood, Dan dos Santos, and especially Wei Wang. He is amazing. I'm also a movie fan—I love watching and studying movies and their visual languages so I can capture a little bit of their magic when I paint. Also, soundtracks—glorious, epic soundtracks by Hans Zimmer. I also play pen and paper RPGs. I really love this stuff, and I think the reason I’m an artist nowadays it's because I’m a fan of things like these. They’re what pushes me forwards and makes me aim for greater things.<br />
<br />
Q: And what about video games for inspiration?<br />
I love raiding. I’ve tried it hardcore, I’ve tried it casual, and I enjoy it more than I can socially admit. I had to step down from hardcore to a bit more casual playstyle so I could work on my art too. It was weird at the time, but now that I have found a guild I can call home I am in comfortable position to keep both going.<br />
<br />

<br />
I also love the lore in the game, and I have a couple of friends I can geek out with about the lore until my heart is content. And of course, I love the art in Warcraft—in-game, comics, and I can't wait for the movie! The heaviness of the style, the details, the scenery, the races. The community is also amazing, and I have made many friends inside the game over all the years playing.<br />
<br />
Q: If you could add one thing to the game, artistically, what would it be?<br />
Customizable horns! Yes! But wait, this one is already promised. So how about Dreadsteeds that fly with a blazing trail of fire in the skies!<br />
Another great thing would be more detailed armor, in the chest area especially. I love the work being done over with models in Heroes of the Storm, and I'd love to see something similar in WoW too!<br />
<br />
Our thanks goes out to SulaMoon for sharing these lovely pieces with the WoW community.<br />

The Heroes PTR (http://www.heroesnexus.com/news/1499-test-map-reworked-skins-and-animations-v2-matthew) got increased respawn times and smaller stat differences between levels at lower levels to try and make games more even if a team falls a little behind early on.<br />

<br />
My dislike for GC has been longstanding... the majority of his posts (while employed at blizzard) always made go:<br />
http://img.memecdn.com/wtf_o_1215252.jpg<br />
<br />
I felt at the time (possibly still) that he had a severe disconnect with the community. Which stems from not actually listening. Making decisions on how they think we should play vs how we are/ or how we want to play. If you aren't making the game for the players you're begging the question, &quot;Who are you making the game for?&quot;<br />
<br />
mmo-champion has been following his activity post employment, and many here have praised him for his efforts at blizzard.<br />
<br />
Food for thought, though.<br />
<br />
During his entire employment WoW has seen NOTHING but a decline in subs. To place that blame solely on him is both irrational and unfair, but its an interesting correlation.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, and this brings us to my original question to him: &quot;Can you list the projects that you personally worked on so we can lay to rest whether this post employment praise is warranted?&quot;<br />
<br />
To which he avoided the question entirely (like a true diplomat). I ask that question because I know one of those projects: LFR. We've seen a ton of posts from people who like to blame the sub loss on LFR. Then GC comes out and says it was a bad idea... okay fine... BUT YOU FUCKING WORKED ON IT! It does the community no good for him to be the good guy now and see the error of his ways and call the implementation crap. If it was crap, he had plenty of time to voice that opinion and affect change WHILE HE WORKED AT BLIZZARD! Because honestly who is a lead designer going to listen to more? Some rando (lots of randos) from the internet, or someone (a developer at that) from within their own organization. So one of GCs early projects puts the game on this further downward spiral... and then when he leaves he claims it was a poor idea... and is now praised for it? Anyone else see the ass backwards logic in that?<br />
<br />
Also, LFR was in direct response to the changes to raiding that happened end of WotLK and into Cata, where character progression was not possible 10n&gt;10h&gt;25n&gt;25h. Because of shared lockouts, and the to ensure that these &quot;10m guilds&quot; were getting their limelight flex was implemented. Bottom line is raid participation ABSOLUTELY PLUMMETED. So instead of going back to the old raid model (which clearly was working)... because that would mean they had to admit they were wrong, that GC was wrong, and that would jeopardize his career and position. They added LFR.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But that already contradicts what Blizzard has said prior, that there are different teams for different aspects of the game and the devs we know and mention when critiquing features are the Team Heads and have final say over what goes in that aspect of the game. It can't be both ways. You can't say they work on it together but can't blame them because it's the whole company's fault and not the team and their head who had final word on what they developed and released to the public that was was received poorly. It is shifting the blame.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Well if we are doing it like that then we can also say that while he was employed with Blizzard, subs were steadily declining for a number of years but after he left the game saw subs increase by 3 mil before suddenly hemorraging them like a fresh wound within a matter of months. With that sort of logic, people would be petitioning Ghostcrawler to be rehired by Blizzard (or at least being a consultant on their work).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It also makes it seem like no one ever speaks out internally against a perceived bad idea. (Bad ideas do exist). According to GC though... it sounds like a bad idea is brought to the table and everyone smiles and nods and gets to work. No one ever raises objections? Or perhaps it was that you signed off on it, and thought it was a good idea at the time? Whether you gave your blessing to a bad idea, or worked on a bad idea... its the same thing. Which ultimately makes you collectively incompetent as well as personally incompetent.</div></div><hr />

What the F are YOU talking about???<br />
<br />
We've literally just experienced them reversing their stance on a major aspect of the game (flying) and then reversing it AGAIN! Why on earth do you think they would hesitate to change the raiding model when they have LITERALLY CHANGED IT EVERY EXPANSION? His career and position??? People at his level with his experience and tenure do not just get fired at any company, not just Blizzard. Reassigned -maybe- but not fired for all kinds of reasons but most importantly because you need people to take chances and be willing to steer the ship through rough waters. There can't be a guillotine at the end of the line for any failure. <br />
<br />
As for raid participation, are you talking about specifically 25 man guilds or something? Because i can promise you that more people are raiding at all difficulty levels except maybe the top tier than ever before. EVER. Between LFR, flex raids, cross server raiding, the group finder, and open raid, there is no way that there are less people raiding now than there were in vanilla when it was the most hardcore shit in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It hasn't changed &quot;EVERY EXPANSION&quot; the last major change to raiding was between WotLK and Cata, and they have just been tweaking the same bad idea ever since, progressively making it worse and worse.<br />
<br />
So what you are saying is people at his level should be encouraged to make bad ideas? Lulz...<br />
<br />
Flying... you are really going with flying as your example? I want to laugh into your mouth so hard right now! They didn't change their stance, they act 100% self righteous and justified in their design decision despite the overwhelming hate behind it. So they gave us flight... now... when it is practically irrelevant and the xpac is over. Oh and btw it will be the exact same model for legion. No flying until it is irrelevant. Them even adding flying came across more like, &quot;Okay, Okay, here it is, shut the fuck up already.&quot; Something that just inspires all kinds of touchy feely good feelings within me regarding their development team.<br />

<br />
Oh really, can you? Can you promise me? Because your promise is so compelling... I for one am totally convinced.<br />
<br />
If you care to back that up with some data I would be happy to concede. But your promises mean dick to me.<br />
<br />
I'm not comparing it vanilla, if anything I'm comparing it to WotLK, which by simple virtue of its all time high in subs says that more people were raiding then than now.<br />
<br />
Everything raiding has become since the changes in raid design at the end WotLK, have been in direct response to less and less people ACTUALLY participating in raids and trying to get it BACK to the participation levels of WotLK.<br />
<br />
When I talk about raid participation plummeting I am referring directly to Cata. Cata raid participation was atrocious until they added LFR with DS. But it is still not on the level of participation as it was in WotLK era. This lack of participation was in DIRECT response to the raid changes. Right then and there was their opportunity to save face and revert the change. Instead they keep putting band-aids on a bad idea.<br />
<br />
In MoP at least you could still acquire similarly looking set pieces. In WoD they slapped you in the face and said well LFR isn't really raiding, if you want to keep doing it fine... but we're gonna give your crappy rewards for it. (making a bad idea, worse) Because who did that benefit?<br />
<br />
I can tell you that hardcore, truly hardcore raiders, don't give a fuck what is happening in LFR whatsoever, whether or not their rewards look the same or not does not matter. What matters to them are world firsts, that people recognize the guild name.</div></div><hr />

He started working for them during Sunwell and was there during the ENTIRETY of Wrath. You know that point where WoW had its LARGEST EVER SUB INCREASE AND COUNT.<br />

At least research some shit before talking out of your ass.</div></div><hr />

WotLK to Cata was probably the smallest change to raiding in that they bumped 10 mans in difficulty and redesigned the LFR from a manual search to automatic grouping.<br />
Flex alone was a huge change in MoP and the WoD changes destroyed guilds with the new formats on a scale only TBC managed before.<br />

You won't until they activate it. And since it's not actually in the game currently, the very earliest opportunity to know is on Tuesday/Wednesday, if indeed they activate it the moment it's in the game files.</div></div><hr />

That isn't how free to play is defined. Also new servers have been added so it should stem the queues a bit now.</div></div><hr />

People like you, are like an angry mob that will throw rotten tomatoes at whatever they deem bad - in pure blind hatred.<br />
<br />
You don't constructively think, who or what did what.<br />
<br />
Thus, re-read, re-do - do right. It's not a conspiracy, it's a TEAM of Developers.<br />
<br />
Well then -- ok, so since we're having massive drops in subscriptions -- let's fire the entire team. Since it's all their fault. Every.Single.One.Of.Them.<br />

Agreed there. The &quot;Big&quot; change between Wrath and Cata was the &quot;casual&quot; -&gt; &quot;Hard&quot; of dungeons. Pretty much everything else stayed the same.</div></div><hr />

https://www.linkedin.com/pub/greg-street/7/644/b35<br />
&quot;Led about half of the World of Warcraft design team. Oversaw class, item, profession, combat, PvP, encounter, UI and major feature design. Shipped 3 expansions and contributed to 2 others.&quot;<br />
<br />
WotLK launched in November 2008, and he started working there in February 2008. WotLK was announced as the next xpac in August of 2007. By the time Greg came on board WotLK was well under way. So it is likely that he contributed very little to that xpac beyond some of the content patches that followed with its initial release, as whole the development plan had already been mapped out (though not complete hence &quot;patches&quot;) so I can't imagine he contributed very much beyond grunt work, bringing the ideas of others to fruition.<br />
<br />
Actually, you are really only proving my point. The largest increase in subs was actually in BC. WotLK was the largest sub period ever (its cap) but not the largest increase. In fact one might argue then, it only capped BECAUSE of GC. I'm not saying this is the case... because as I said earlier its an interesting correlation, not causation.<br />

<br />
Anyone else bugged that leadership is saying blame the team instead of taking some responsibility for their failures in leadership? GC's comments make me respect him less.<br />
<br />
Never respected the guy... he was never an asset to blizzard. Hence the question... which if you all notice... he neglected to answer... like a true politician. I actually have a theory that is an agent of corporate espionage and he is at riot strictly to ruin their game, so that blizzard's moba can be successful. Cuz lets face it... ruining games is what he is good at :)<br />
<br />
He's mentioned before struggles within blizzard hierarchy that make it difficult to change &quot;culture&quot; and almost no room for advancement. This speaks more to corporate culture than it does to design process, so I am reluctant to say that anyone else was forcing him to make changes to the game he did or did not want. Especially when he fingers his team, instead of his superiors.<br />
