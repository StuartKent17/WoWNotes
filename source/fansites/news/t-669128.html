The new World of Warcraft Faction Change service is now live in Europe. As we mentioned previously, http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=9895129741&amp;sid=1 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=9895129741&amp;sid=1) we’ve been in the process of developing a new service for World of Warcraft that will allow players to change their faction from Alliance to Horde or Horde to Alliance for a fee. After purchasing a Faction Change for a character, a player can choose any race of the opposite faction that is compatible with the character’s class. Please note that all achievements and quest lines relating to the Argent Tournament are reset when a character uses the Faction Change service.<br />
<br />
For more information on the Faction Change service, please read the FAQ, http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=39810 (http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=39810) or visit the Faction Change page http://www.wow-europe.com/account/ (http://www.wow-europe.com/account/) to get started.<br />
<br />
We would also like to inform everyone that we will be offering a Race Change Service in the future. This decision was based largely on community feedback, and often in regards to the Faction Change service. Players who choose to switch races will be able to change their race within their same faction and class. Additional information and updates about Race Changes will be published at a future date.

<br />
They actually found that this happened later, so it wasnt in the US' original message.<br />
Loremaster and everything should be flipped, but it was that they decided to make the Argent Tournament system works differently on a technical-level, which made the system unable, somewhy, to convert it from one side to the other.<br />
<br />
Another note: Thanks to Faction Change, its now -possible- to get Exalted Taunka / Vengeance, even if its blizzard should really be adding dailies for them.<br />

How does that suck? You get to do the same faceroll quests again and earn even more gold. Besides, you won't have to get the rep bonus item from the threat from above quest and the other 3 champions seals quests since you're already exalted, thus resulting in even more gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Loremaster will NOT transfer because any faction specific quests will not transfer, even if horde and alliance have &quot;the same&quot; quest they have different IDs/quest giver/ender etc<br />
<br />
Anything that the SAME quest is available to both factions will transfer, anything that is not, won't, and given that more than half of the quests in EK and Kal are faction specific means you will lose 300+ quests in both EK and Kal. Northrend and Outland you'll lose quiet a few also, but it wont be as drastic since a larger percentage are from neutral factions</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you've already completed it yes, please note though that if you are working on it will reset to the number of neutral quests you've done only. Meaning all the alliance/horde quests you've done will have to be redone. For example, I need Loremaster of Kalimdor and was about 100 quests away from achieving it. Upon switching to horde, I the counter dropped to around 145/685<br />
<br />
So my advice is to earn Loremaster before changing.</div></div><hr />

So because you have recently moved your character, and it's still locked out, it's Blizzards fault because you didn't think ahead, or now want to faction/server change?<br />

<br />
US change is $30 thats at current rates 19 euro now the European faction change is there the costs are for us 25 euro thats at current rates $35.<br />
Americans are poor, remember?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a question:<br />
<br />
Can I change my faction to horde, than change on another server? Or is it on the same cooldown?<br />
You can realm transfer right after you faction changed, obviously :)</div></div><hr />

you cant, faction chance is Horde ---&gt; alliance or alliance ----&gt; horde.. :) 30 or 60 day cooldown too but after that you can .</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That requires two faction changes as race change isn't ready yet.<br />
<br />
And all those who get the you aren't logged out message, you need to be logged out for 15 minutes before trying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Says in the FAQ that the char has to be logged out for 1 hour :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sigmundus says 15 min above me, but i was told 1 hours by the billing support line :p,<br />
<br />
PS: I cant even get on the page, i get a 500 (too many logged in) or a 404 (Page not found/existing) GREAT, did manage to faction change my paladin though before this so he went from male draenei to female Belf :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That would require 2 (if it works that you can change to one faction and back to the other and then pickin a new race?) which would mean a 60day wait between changes.<br />
<br />
Give us race change now! please blizzard :3</div></div><hr />

Doesnt mean it cant be done :)<br />
SSC/TK can be done with 10 people prolly and the later should wield you at least some players since the chance of the mount dropping.<br />
Vasjh might be a bit harder to find people for but without the need to clear the entire thing it should be doable.<br />
MH part is a joke, we did the entire questpart in like 3 minutes.<br />
Just exit the alliance base (after triggering the waves) and take the first possible right.<br />
You'll end up at their spawn point and you can just aoe zerg em down without having to wait for the next wave to wander over to the camp.<br />

My thoughts exactly.<br />
<br />
PLUS name change is £6, customisation (which includes name change) is £12, so surely Faction change (which includes name change and customisation) should be £18?</div></div><hr />

12£ custimazation<br />
and 13£for the faction chance which involves deleting your old char, making an exact copy of the old save file on a new char chematic is too much to ask. i dont think so... and yes there is a diffrence but thats due to the constant economy in the world<br />

<br />
Alright im simpler words, its a quite hard process to make your char into a horde/alliance/race change...<br />
<br />
but if 25£ is too much to pay then feel free to level a new alt :) no one is forcing you to pay it ;D<br />

No you cant... was said in the Q&amp;A on blizzcon that you can change from lets say Drenie to orc... but if you change back to alliance later on you automaticly change to your original race.<br />

So because you have recently moved your character, and it's still locked out, it's Blizzards fault because you didn't think ahead, or now want to faction/server change?<br />
<br />
Shut up.<br />
<br />
That said, server transfers were never included, nor promoted as a feature with the faction change. Get over it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually this is a BUG. You try to use faction change, the payment is refused (again a bug) and it says try again after 24 hours. After a few minutes it then says your character is ineligible to move for 2 months, and the character is unplayable on the realm too, since it thinks it's mid transfer.<br />
<br />
It has happened to me, and there's a rather large post on the wow forums of it happening to others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shadow Vault and the Ebon Blade; The entire Shadow Vault quest line has to be redone in order to open it up again (Yes, your rep remains. I was exalted when transferring).<br />
<br />
Any quest chains you did, that have a horde/alliance equivalent, but have a different starting point, looked to be reset.<br />
<br />
Your dailies get reset.<br />
<br />
Argent Tournament being reset has already been mentioned.<br />
<br />
You will be missing certain flight points in Northrend. For some reason I didn't have Westfall Brigand in Grizzly Hills and Nessingwary's Camp in SB. I didn't notice any missing from Outland or Azeroth, but will check again later.<br />
<br />
Overall, after completing the Northrend Loremaster achievement as horde and then changing faction, it looks as though I have maybe 100 or so quests that I can now do.<br />
All I can say is Ka-ching!$$ I made 600g last night, just from repeating the Shadow Vault chain and there's probably another couple of thousand gold there for me again.<br />
<br />
So a couple of tips before you change factions.<br />
Do the Northrend Loremaster achievement first.<br />
On the day you change, do your 25 dailies first.<br />
Load up on faction pets and recipes.</div></div><hr />

Or u can only do a faction change on the same realm.<br />

Example:<br />

From Kazzak Horde -&gt; Frostmane Allied<br />

<br />
No. Changing realm is an entirely different service.</div></div><hr />

As I said earlier, it would appear that quest chains that have a different starting point (and therefore a different quest ID) are reset.<br />
The Shadow Vault chain is a case in point, as it starts with Koltira Deathweaver (quest ID - 12892) for Horde and with Thassarian (quest ID - 12887) for Alliance.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nalle</div><div class="date">2009-09-18, 09:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple of things to note after changing faction.<br />
<br />
Shadow Vault and the Ebon Blade; The entire Shadow Vault quest line has to be redone in order to open it up again (Yes, your rep remains. I was exalted when transferring).<br />
<br />
Any quest chains you did, that have a horde/alliance equivalent, but have a different starting point, looked to be reset.<br />
<br />
Your dailies get reset.<br />
<br />
Argent Tournament being reset has already been mentioned.<br />
<br />
You will be missing certain flight points in Northrend. For some reason I didn't have Westfall Brigand in Grizzly Hills and Nessingwary's Camp in SB. I didn't notice any missing from Outland or Azeroth, but will check again later.<br />
<br />
Overall, after completing the Northrend Loremaster achievement as horde and then changing faction, it looks as though I have maybe 100 or so quests that I can now do.<br />
All I can say is Ka-ching!$$ I made 600g last night, just from repeating the Shadow Vault chain and there's probably another couple of thousand gold there for me again.<br />
<br />
So a couple of tips before you change factions.<br />
Do the Northrend Loremaster achievement first.<br />
On the day you change, do your 25 dailies first.<br />
Load up on faction pets and recipes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All this happened to me (as everyone else ofc ) but when I changed, my dailies did NOT reset.</div></div><hr />

Say if I have loremaster of Northrend, will I keep this ahv or will it be wiped? If its not wiped will I be able to do all the oposite factions quests?<br />
Will I be able to do the starting areas quests for my new faction?<br />
Will my 10,000 gold from quest ahv be wiped?<br />

<br />
You will still have the Northrend Loremaster achievement.<br />
<br />
Some quest will become available to you, since they are different to the opposite faction. Basically, any quest that has a different ID to the one you have already done, will be available for you.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can now do the starting area quests for your new factions, because, as I said, these quests will all have different ID's from the ones you have previously done.<br />
<br />
If you have the 10k gold from quests achievement, then you will retain that achievement. You do NOT lose any COMPLETED achievements. However, some incomplete achievements will probably be altered. For example, people have posted that their Kalimdor Loremaster achievement progress went from 500/700 down to 100/700.<br />
If that's something your not prepared to let happen, then complete the Loremaster achievement first, before switching factions.</div></div><hr />

It does for those who don't care about gold (because they already have a ton of it or just don't care about it) and don't want to respend 1 month getting back to champion everywhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My dailies being reset looks like a bug. No biggie.<br />
<br />
All my factions remained the same and directly transferred to the Alliance versions, except The Silver Covenant (Sunreavers), which went back to neutral from honoured.</div></div><hr />

The thing is all of Blizzard's other services accept maestro, visa, etc. Blizz just won't accept they have rushed it their end and messed up the payment for character transfer for the people from the UK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I know.<br />
<br />
Visa worked fine with my other transfers etc, but had it been standing at a headline or anything, then I would've used Mastercard to start with, just sucks I had to get blocked for 24/72 hours before I was told. =/</div></div><hr />

No blocked cards aren't always Blizzards fault, but when I pay my subs and then attempt Faction transfer with the same card and it doesn't work AND thousands of other people have the same problem AND your father works for a bank who have been dealing with the issue for days and know it isn't at their end AND Blizzard have had payment problems in the UK with almost every service they launched for wow, then it points the finger at Blizzard really doesn't it?</div></div><hr />
