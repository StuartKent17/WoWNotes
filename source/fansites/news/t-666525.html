They are now working on Twin Valkyrs and still have 32 attempts left, we will probably see more first kills on US realms soon.<br />

Koralon the Flame Watcher has Arrived<br />
Coinciding with the launch of Arena Season 7, Koralon the Flame Watcher will be activated in the western wing of Wintergrasp Fortress and awaiting the controlling faction. Koralon will drop loot for slots similar to Emalon, which includes both raiding tier items and PvP gear. Both 10- and 25-player versions will drop Emblems of Triumph as well. See you in Wintergrasp! <br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment at PAX<br />
Blizzard Entertainment will once again be representing in full force at the 2009 Penny Arcade Expo, taking place this weekend, September 4-6 in Seattle, Washington. PAX attendees will have access to playable versions of Diablo III (including the recently announced Monk class), the earth-shattering World of Warcraft: Cataclysm expansion, and the engrossing StarCraft II single-player campaign. Community managers will also be in attendance to chat with attendees about the past, present, and future of Blizzard Entertainment games. We hope to see you there!<br />

Arena Tournament Realm Status – Offline<br />
The Arena Tournament Realm is now offline with the conclusion of the 2009 World of Warcraft Arena Tournament. The realm will be offline until the start of the next Arena Tournament season. We want to thank everyone who participated in or followed this year’s tournament and welcome you all to return next year!

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage <br />
Combustion<br />
There are two slightly entwined problems here. One is Combustion just not keeping up with other mage talents. That's a problem we want to fix. While there are plenty of examples of talents that aren't as popular as they should be, we consider Combustion to be a pretty core talent to the Fire mage experience, and thus we consider it a bigger problem. (And no, we aren't ready to announce a change yet.)<br />
<br />
The other is that character stats are much higher than we originally predicted. This is less of a big deal for things like Str and Sta that can just keep growing, but it gets messy with the ratings like crit and avoidance. While more crit is generally always better, you do run into weird scenarios when players can realistically think about 100% crit chances (if not now, perhaps in Icecrown).<br />
<br />
The reason the stats got so high is that the Ulduar model of gear (where hard modes offer higher ilevel) was something we added after ship and therefore after the core combat mechanics of Lich King were already in place. We designed the system with lower numbers from gear than we are ultimately going to end up offering. You might be able to guess at the highest ilevels in Icecrown and those are higher than we originally planned on them being. The alternative was that hard modes didn't offer better loot. :(<br />
<br />
Anyway, we can tweak the combat formulae to some extent, but short of &quot;Icecrown Radiance&quot; that drops your crit by 10%, some of these issues aren't going to go away until the level cap increases and we can adjust all of the combat ratings again.

<br />
I would like to disagree here. Soon after players farmed out Naxxramas gear they were pointing out on ridiculous gear stats which were on par with endgame sunwell % stating &quot;how come I have such ridiculous amount of crit after first tier of raiding gear.&quot; (this was at least case for warriors, wasn't reading other classes forums) Blizzard adjusted this in Ulduar where actually upgrading from t7 to t8 meant loosing a lot of crit but they had to add other stats to be sure players would update their gear. I think this was mistake they had to notice before and blaming it to hardmode gear doesn't feel right.</div></div><hr />

It's rather silly to be claiming &quot;first kills&quot; on a dungeon that's going to get facerolled by most of the world before tonight. Ah well, good for them and back to Ulduar I guess, the new dungeon doesn't seem to be that time consuming.<br />

1 tank 2 heals 7 dps on 10 man.. Stats are just way too extreme now, with 40k unbuffed tanks. Although I don't mind becsuse I see WotLk as a testing ground for these new modes. Next time i'm sure blizz will perfect it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want to talk &quot;Diminishing Returns&quot; a talent that gives you a 10% crit buff for 3 crits every 3 minutes is neither class defining nor game-changing once said class is over 60%. <br />
<br />
Do you think you can tell the difference between 60% and 70%?<br />
<br />
90% and 100%?<br />

Blaming it on extra ilevels is an excuse. Normal ToC gear is higher ilevel than Hard mode Ulduar. They knew when Wrath released, they'd be adding Ulduar, ToC, and Icecrown before the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Normal ToC gear is higher ilevel than Hard mode Ulduar. They knew when Wrath released, they'd be adding Ulduar, ToC, and Icecrown before the next expansion. <br />
<br />
<br />
But the hard mode gear is adding an extra &quot;tier&quot; of items to each zone.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way: Shipped 10-mans were around ilvl 200, shipped 25-mans around ilvl 213, with hard modes (Sarth+2 loot and the like) +13. Ulduar then shifted this up 13 (weapons an extra 6). But because of Ulduar hard mode loot, added an *extra* +13 to the tier. So now they either had the option to set ToC normal modes at Ulduar hard mode level or another level even beyond that. They decided to go beyond that by half a tier. So now each tier is adding 26 (or at least 20 for half-tier) ilvls instead of 13 like they would without hard modes.<br />
<br />
Non-hard-mode plan (probably their original &quot;vision&quot;) for 25-mans: ilvl 213 at ship, 226 in Ulduar, 239 in Coliseum, 252 in Icecrown.<br />
<br />
New plan: ilvl 213 at ship, up to 239 in Ulduar, up to 258 in Coliseum (ignoring cloaks at 272), up to 298 in Icecrown (most likely 272 will be the normal modes, 285 hard modes, 298 for extremely special loot like the cloaks).<br />
<br />
So we're looking at 33-46 ilvls of inflation in Wrath's ultimate dungeon due to hard modes. And we already see 19 ilvls of inflation in Trials not even including the cloaks. I can certainly see where this might throw their original plans for Icecrown crit levels out of whack.</div></div><hr />

Every moron could have seen this coming, and it's completely rediculous. If they hadn't blown up the iLvl so much there wouldn't be an issue, can anyone explain to me why normal TotC-25 gives better loot then Ulduar hard mode? They should have just sticked with the 13 level gap:<br />
<br />
heroics + naxx-10: 200<br />
naxx-25 + ulduar-10 (+ TotC-5 hc): 213<br />
ulduar-10 hard modes, ulduar-25, TotC-10: 226<br />
ulduar-25 hard modes, TotC-10 hard modes, TotC-25: 339<br />
TotC-25 hard modes: 252<br />
<br />
You can put some items in between if it's appropriate, and it's a full 20 iLvl lower then the 272 cloaks that are available now. Keeping the gear level between instances closer together also makes it more interesting to choose gear: not every piece of shit that drops from an easy boss in a higher tier instance is automatically an upgrade. I'll mail Blizzard an invoice for coming up with this highly sophisticated and impeccable concept, clearly it's beyond their own intellectual grasp...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxxored</div><div class="date">2009-09-02, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When I went to Blizz Con I was thinking about questions to ask the raid and dungeon as well as the item pannel. I wanted to complain about the gear inflation in WotLK and how it was so much worse than BC with the many tiers of gear and the huge gap from T6 to T9 already seen.<br />
<br />
So I hunted up Kiljaden loot tables and found the 1H epic weapons he drops were ilvl 164 and dps 114.2. Then checking out old Kelthuzad's lvl 60 loot table I found his gear to be ilvl 89 1h dps 73.1.<br />
<br />
So using those numbers I found from end 1.3 to end 2.3 ilvls had increased by 1.84 and dps by 1.56. <br />
<br />
So right now at 3.2 top end items so far have 258 ilvl and 1h dps of 216.4. So from 2.3 to 3.2 we increased 1.57x ilvl and 1.89x dps. That means that we are still within target of the 1.84x ilvl boost come 3.3 putting top end items off of Arthas being ilvl 302.<br />
<br />
302 ilvl items are rather impressive but the dps scale isn't linear and I haven’t been able to find a formula to calculate what the dps of the weapons should be. Already were seeing larger damage multipliers than expected.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxxored</div><div class="date">2009-09-02, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also think a major problem with &quot;gear inflation&quot; is that it is so pervasive. Everyone has top end gear because of &quot;accessibility of content&quot; and when compared with previous versions more people are running into the naturally occurring &quot;DR zones&quot;.<br />
<br />
End game raiders know from BC and Vanilla that at points not necessarily in X.3 dungeons stats like crit, hit, armor pen, and expertise leveled off and gear that should be upgrades simply weren’t any more. It is why end raiders spread sheet. Only thing is casual players who previously didn’t have to deal with DR fields or soft caps now are hitting those and it's foreign to them. Explaining to them that a piece of gear with higher ilvl may not be as good any more is counter intuitive but it's no different that how it was for all raider in the past.<br />
<br />
Note: not saying that the accessibility is a bad thing or that casuals are stupid the math is actually quite complicated and the idea of being crit capped on raid bosses rather confusing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, in short, after 5 years and billions of dollars Blizzard still has no freaking clue to balance World of Warcraft. They really should have seen this one coming. This isn't the first time it happened. They should have steered away from hard modes instead of giving into the elitist hardcore asshats that whined they weren't special enough. Maybe in Cataclysm Blizzard will finally get it right. Then again, maybe during Cataclysm someone will finally make a game that is worthy of rivaling WoW and then Blizzard won't need to get it right anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Its only easy as long as people figure out to move out of the fire when they are taking supreme damage, and if everyone isn't capped off constantly (and sometimes even if they are) there is a good chance they are going down to the flame whirl. That being said, the guild in 10 man got him to 10% the first time and down the second time. The fail pug I was with got him dead in 3 shots with just about everyone dieing the time we actually got him down.</div></div><hr />

I did indeed mean 239. But not 245. There's no reason normal TotC-25 loot should be better then Ulduar-25 hard mode loot, the bosses are way, way easier.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrostemplar</div><div class="date">2009-09-02, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, in short, after 5 years and billions of dollars Blizzard still has no freaking clue to balance World of Warcraft. They really should have seen this one coming. This isn't the first time it happened. They should have steered away from hard modes instead of giving into the elitist hardcore asshats that whined they weren't special enough. Maybe in Cataclysm Blizzard will finally get it right. Then again, maybe during Cataclysm someone will finally make a game that is worthy of rivaling WoW and then Blizzard won't need to get it right anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
They do have a clue. The problem is balancing while making the tons of retard people that are the ones the pay their wages interested in the game. <br />
<br />
There is no problem in existing hard modes and with them dropping better loot. DR is an issue mostly to those player (although not limited to them) and gear escalation can be a bit of a problem (lioke inflation is).<br />
<br />
In the end, the post correlates with combustion, and the explanation why a &quot;core&quot; (hey, it is a 31 pointer) talent is being bypassed by many raiders (me included), because it was affected by gear. Newsflash: even without IC gear levels - hell, even without full i226 gear level - combustion sucks.</div></div><hr />

Shall we farm that boring, ugly instance until 3.3 for gear now, which everyone will get anyway? Sry, but in my eyess 3.2 is the most retardet bullcrap, that ever happened to this game raid-wise...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either your memory or experience is failling you :) - there was plenty of other and worse retarded bullcrap in the game raid-wise. TBC raiding ladder being a far bigger one.<br />
<br />
Anyway, Blizzard is trying dynamic PVE ladder for the first time - meaning that you are supposed to face the most recent content, and each time they release new content they launch a &quot;quick path&quot; to the gear needed for that content. A bit similar to hte diminishing XP requirement to level each time and expansion is launched. <br />
<br />
And yes, it seems that TOC raids should have been harder than they were.</div></div><hr />

That's what they're doing. By running ToC/HToC you'll atleast have the potential to get the gear and stats you need to get into IC and /wave at Mr. Arthas and whatnot. ;D And who doesnt want to do that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I expected the same. On non-heroic they are by far the toughest encounter in there. Granted, that just puts them on par of, say, Mimiron instead of Razorscale. But that's still tougher. Guess they don't scale up going to heroic as much as the others (especially Twins, who practically come out and hand you loot without even doing any work on non-heroic, but seem to be a bit of a block on heroic).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
lol... too bad for you, that they downed the twins (World first) just a few hours after your post... <br />
<br />
Ensidia is just great and probably the best guild on wow atm...<br />
<br />
still that doesn't make USA &gt; EU or EU &gt; USA... lol, that's just silly...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's funny, cause if Black Dragonflight was one of the first servers up then that's a World First also. Can we get a news post for that please?</div></div><hr />

This would give the needed boost when the crits just don't come.<br />

<br />
Every forum should IP ban idiots that post &quot;omg first!&quot;. People should give useful (or at least on topic) comments to gtfo the forums.<br />
<br />
Congrats to the world first kills. I am somewhat disappointed though. I was hoping the fights would be so hard it would require quite a bit more 245 gear worn by all participants to really be feasible.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">khanthal</div><div class="date">2009-09-02, 11:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">GC's post about crit rating on gear going up too high seems silly.<br />
<br />
How hard is it to simply keep the crit at what it is now and grow on spell power / attack power, haste or hit? <br />
<br />
That's not how item budgets work. Also then those other stats would get too high. Crit was just an example.<br />
<br />
Yes they could shift the item budget toward spell power/attack power. But given how the distribution algorithm works you likely wont get much extra and the gear will look like a mostly side-grade and no one will want it. <br />
<br />
They had this problem in BC and had to buff all the gear rather a lot early on. No one wanted any of it. The solution is as GC says: either they change the stat model somewhat or they add an &quot;icecrown radiance&quot;. They can't overhaul it until the level cap moves.</div></div><hr />

Only what 75 or 80 guilds in the world have even killed heroic Beasts? Then of those almost all of them made it to twin valkyrs. There is so much tank damage in beasts and even the best guilds in the world aren't beating Icehowl's enrage they are spreading the raid out so he has to kill 1 person at a time while ranged continues to dps and keep up DoTs to kill him.</div></div><hr />

But I guess them being in a world class guild they must make it their number one priority.<br />
<br />
Anyways...congrats :D!</div></div><hr />
