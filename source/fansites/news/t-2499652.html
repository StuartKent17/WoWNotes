In one of the interviews Ion said, &quot;The end cinematic of Eternal Palace will make it clear who the last boss of the expansion will be.&quot;, but the end cinematic was vague at best with it. That's why people were going, &quot;Oh there's probably a secret ending that will actually make it clear who the final boss will be.&quot;<br />
<br />
As of now, it isn't clear. Is it Lorethemar and Jaina? It is N'Zoth? Will be be Aszhara again in some N'Zoth twisted form? No one can actually tell, we can just guess, which is far from a clear answer to who the final boss is.</div></div><hr />

I know it's not really a matter of vindication for Method, because Method, Limit, and everyone else involved have put the time and effort in to win this race. But it's nice to know Redbull doesn't win this little battle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that's true, primarily because any leads were nullified as pretty much all guilds working on Azshara were banging their head on the 3 adds phase until Blizzard nerfed the enrage time.</div></div><hr />

Yawn. Who cares. Well funded guild with several world firsts gets another world first. Is anyone really that eager to watch over 100 attempts to kill the same boss?<br />
<br />
<br />
Mind explaining how it's over hyped? Most WoW twich views were going to Method Stream, Limit (Redbull), and their guild leaders. Furthermore other big streamers were talking about it on the daily. Lastly the viewers that they were drawing it were significantly higher than regular WoW content. It was being talked about in general chats, guild chats, some random dungeon/pvp/raid finders and more. If anything the WF race is great for WoW. It helps unite a certain part of the community in a way that WoW itself hasn't been able to do.<br />
<br />
Not taking shots at you guys because your opinions are just as valid as everyone elses but the fact is that a lot of people cared. I came in after the kill and Method had over 140k viewers while other viewers like Redbull and other members had over 10k. It is very very clear that there is an audience for WF races. People enjoy watching content they can't do, they enjoy the casters, the theorycrafting, they enjoy many parts of it.</div></div><hr />

Because the boss might very well have been unkillable. It's not like another 2-3 weeks would have given Method much more in terms of gear after all.<br />
Also, even in this &quot;nerfed&quot; state, most guilds, even the really good mythics guilds won't be able to kill her. There'll be more nerfs befor that happens.</div></div><hr />

ya they do test them. <br />
Sure you don't have the mythic and super secret final phase stuff, but its still working on the major mechanics of the fight before its released.<br />

<br />
You don't think the nerfs would have been unnecessary given another week-3 weeks worth of gear?<br />
<br />
For example, and I’m just throwing it out from the sidelines, but the 2 to 3 minute add change would have been directly tied to needing more dps, and what provides dps? Gear. It’s literally the reason standard guilds take month+ to down these bosses? Sure the nerfs here and there help but again most nerfs aren’t due to “unkillable” mechanics.<br />
<br />
Not saying these WF guilds aren’t the playing at the top level but yea.</div></div><hr />

Not as a viable first kill strategy anyway. Lowering number of healers under what is generally accepted (4-6) should be reserved for when you overgear the fight and want to speed up the clear time.<br />
In a world where titanforging is a thing, I really don't think boss requiring your raid to actually have said titanforged gear is a bad thing (I hate TF with burning passion btw). It's just yet another kind of gearcheck, which is completely in line with what the rest of the game is doing. No merit, just RNG participation prizes. In BT, you had to farm it (or AH) for months, so that you'd have mats to craft enough SR gear to progress beyond Mother. Who cares if the nolifers that get fking paid to play the game burn themselves out headbashing against a boss that is not killable with the gear they currently have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even with the nerf Limit haven't managed to kill the boss and most likely not able to do it for quite a while forward either due to the lack of DPS because of 3 healers instead of 2.<br />
<br />
Method just brained together a great strategy that paid off while NA didn't dare to take the same risk and lost the race.<br />
<br />
So yeah I guess Method is bad because they killed a nerfed boss but Limit is good who can't even kill a nerfed boss lol great logic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong and wrong again, the nerf helped Limit since that's around the time Blizz always hotfixed them in, when Limit logged and started playing and Method calling it for the day...that's when the nerfs were always added. <br />
<br />
The reason that they were wiping was because of the 2min enrage on the adds in phase 3 which was clearly not doable...there is such a thing as overtuning.<br />
Method won, yet again, because they always take the smart approach, they always stop to check the numbers, mechanics, what they can improve on, what they can change etc. instead of constantly bashing their head against the boss until it dies. <br />
<br />
The 2 heal was the right play and it showed in spades even tho everyone opted for 3 healers. There is no doubt about it, Method just has the better strats.</div></div><hr />

Sure you don't have the mythic and super secret final phase stuff, but its still working on the major mechanics of the fight before its released.<br />

well I guess If you count the hours and days spent on the ptr, they really had 3+ weeks on this boss.<br />

No guild besides method could sustain a world first race if it last several weeks. They are already playing 14+ hours a day.</div></div><hr />

Competition my dude. It essentially boils down to my team vs your team and, if anything, it's easy to see that that matters for a lot of people especially when they're getting sponsorship deals and crowd funded to nearly make a career out of it. Throw in the fact that it's an international competition between NA and EU and it just adds fuel to the fire.<br />

I'm indifferent to it and mostly revel in the aftermath.</div></div><hr />

Yet, here you are , clicking on the thread, posting in it. For someone bashing it, you sure are balls deep in it. Whats more sad? The world first raid or coming in here to complain about it? Or how about making an alt to bitch instead of on your main account? Your grandkids (if you even have any one day) sure will be proud.</div></div><hr />

<br />
knowing the base mechanics ahead of time helps you tremendously focus on the new mechanics. I mean that's 101 to raiding mythic.<br />
<br />
try raiding at the 150-250 level and you will see the impact of people not knowing even the basic heroic mechanics when starting a mythic fight.<br />

<br />
idd, method went with the &quot;high risk better reward comb&quot; aka 2 healing it with extra dps and saving BL for last, while limit went with the &quot;consist&quot; strat, both works very fine as it seems, but in the end, method comp is the winner, and clearly as i stated before, if limit plans to win against method, scrype need to retire, that dude is just smart.<br />
<br />
everyone was frowning about method 2 heal, even casters at some point, and the meme &quot;break time&quot; due to method taking so many breaks, but not random breaks, actually scrype and rogerbrown studying the issues break, but some people are beyond pepega to understand all this.</div></div><hr />

How is that any different from sports celebrities?<br />
<br />
Sports have been made to be really important for kids in schools for years -- so this isn't just a personal time issue, it's tied to their education, and many parents expect their children to have some extracurricular that is usually a sport -- and practically no one gets anything out of being good at sports, there is just the tiny percentage that go to make it in the NFL or whatever, just like Twitch streamers or YouTube content creators.</div></div><hr />

The same way you probably enjoys watching well funded teams with several championships trying another cup. &quot;Is anyone really that eager to watch over 100 minutes of &lt;sport&gt; to score the same points?&quot;<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong and wrong again, the nerf helped Limit since that's around the time Blizz always hotfixed them in, when Limit logged and started playing and Method calling it for the day...that's when the nerfs were always added. <br />
<br />
The reason that they were wiping was because of the 2min enrage on the adds in phase 3 which was clearly not doable...there is such a thing as overtuning.<br />
Method won, yet again, because they always take the smart approach, they always stop to check the numbers, mechanics, what they can improve on, what they can change etc. instead of constantly bashing their head against the boss until it dies. <br />
<br />
The 2 heal was the right play and it showed in spades even tho everyone opted for 3 healers. There is no doubt about it, Method just has the better strats.<br />
<br />
That is not exactly &quot;overtuning&quot;, this game is still the type of game where you keep farming gear to improve your overall power to overcome the gear checks.<br />
<br />
The thing is that for this &quot;race to world first&quot; product to work out, the bosses now need to be &quot;doable&quot; with very marginal gear improvement over the last top tier.<br />
<br />
For the game itself, the boss wasn't overtuned as that enrage timer would be done with enough mythic gear from the raid in a few weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example, and I’m just throwing it out from the sidelines, but the 2 to 3 minute add change would have been directly tied to needing more dps, and what provides dps? Gear. It’s literally the reason standard guilds take month+ to down these bosses? Sure the nerfs here and there help but again most nerfs aren’t due to “unkillable” mechanics.<br />
<br />
Not saying these WF guilds aren’t the playing at the top level but yea.<br />
<br />
There is quite simply not that much more gear to get. Heck, some of the gear you get outside the raid is actually better and Method maxed that out befor they even got to the last boss.<br />

How toxic the fanbase was when Limit got to Azshara a day earlier and got down to 50% first. Christ.<br />
<br />
Both sides were equally toxic. Limit actively banned anyone talking bad about Method on their streams and told their viewers to stop being toxic because they were legit just playing a game. Limit were fantastic to watch during this race because their guild was clearly just having fun with each other and making fun of the situation. I found Method kept coming across as the competition was the only thing that mattered. Plenty of members actively talked down about Limit and you could see they were heavily frustrated at missing out on Za'qul right after calling everyone in Limit idiots. Their frustration around mistiming their split raids was hugely apparent.<br />
So I'd say both communities were equally as toxic, but Limit clearly had the best attitude. It ended up being a meme on the Limit side of sharing angry messages, mainly revolving around being a &quot;victim mentality&quot; guild and use of &quot;gamer words&quot; as they put it. That being said there were also plenty of fun moments in both streams, Method had some great casters and Limit had some funny banter. Here's hoping Method and Redbull can sort out their differences or better yet more sponsors can sign on with Blizzard getting involved to create a proper race of the best guilds with equal opportunity for both players (save the US guilds beta testing all the fights like always).</div></div><hr />

Ahh so they boosted the benthic gear, so most(?) of the gear dropping from mythic wouldn't have been an upgrade and/or slight upgrade to where it wouldn't provide said dps gains needed.</div></div><hr />

Limit and Method are literally the definition of money streamers. Despite the fact they have money being donated to charity all of this is being done for their own streams exposure and themselves. They're not streaming world firsts for any reason other than their own benefits, yet people seem to think that isn't so. Not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact I'd say that people who turn a video game and the people who kill a boss first into a sport are hilarious and small minded, unless it's in good fun.

maybe i like what i like and you like what you like. why do i have to be small-minded when i watch the whole thing? why is it bad that they make money out of it? if i like what i see and if me seeing it helps them.. then why not? no loss on either side.</div></div><hr />

Streamers are just doing what they prefer to do with their lives and try to make money off it. Well they better make as much money off it as they can, it is their job. If you are in a guild that goes for world firsts it's not like you are able to have a job on the side to pay the bills. Also count in the fact that many professional gamers do not finish a professional education, they just do not have the time for it. When they eventually stop streaming they literally have zero job experience nor 9/5 job mentality. It's a risk they take. Maybe they get a little fame, maybe they will be forgotten tomorrow, but life will go on and 95% of the &quot;professional&quot; streamers will need an income after their streaming carreer.<br />

Can't blame them, they put a lot of hours into the game and honestly the way they play it's like a job they enjoy. The more money involved the more competition will come because great players could actually convince themselves that there is some worth to their time besides enjoyment. <br />

<br />
Both Limit and Method put on a good fight and kept it interesting in the end. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. There are no if's. <br />
<br />
Also about people whining about the nerfs... they were imminent. Both guilds and actually even more guilds that have been raiding for so long, couldn't keep up with it. If we went into a 3rd week it would be a disaster for the raiders themselvs. Think a bit about them as well, noone of them wants to do more than what they already did. 14-16 hour days infront of a computer for 2 weeks already including the prep heroic splits.<br />
<br />
It was godsend that blizzard nerfed the boss or we'd still be seeing phase3 wipes and we'd be seeing best attempts being around 30%.<br />
<br />
Also about people saying 'oh boohoo blizzard helped method with the nerfs' ... wtf did you watch a different race than me? Everyone was equally helped by those nerfs. Apart from the fact that Blizzard is a US company and its pretty normal and understandable that the devs etc would be cheering for a US guild and not an EU guild, the nerfs benefited both.<br />
I don't see why people think that Limit would have killed the boss without the nerfs. They only managed to get 3 adds down once and that was with 1 player being alive. Method killed 2 of them and eventually they would get around the 3rd, and as for the composition Method had way more dps so ph3 previously once mastered would have been easier for Method with the extra dps. <br />
The nerf went live way after Limit started raiding again, giving them a fair chance.<br />
<br />
It was a very good race and congrats to both guilds, I believe they are both winners because they proved that you can have a decent race going on and make some money for your players without massive disadvantages.<br />
<br />
As for the Redbull vs Method dispute, f Redbull, I am pretty glad they didn't get many views, they have no reason to takeover the wow raiding event. <br />
My personal opinion on it is that since its such a huge thing and the method channel was toping twitch most of the times during the 2 weeks blizzard should finally take over the whole thing, sponsor it, give fair price pools to the players getting involved in such high level and split the money from views etc with the top 3 guilds or something (obviously its harder to split with more guilds).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">babyback</div><div class="date">2019-07-29, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My question is, how many attempts did each guild need? Those nerfs were really significant and at a point in the fight that Method was struggling. Personally, I think it would have only been fair to wait to push any huge changes through until Tuesday and to time it out so both teams were able to work with it. In my books, the team with the fewest attempts after the nerf is the real winner. Which ever one that is. <br />
<br />
I just think Blizz dropped the ball with nerfs mid raid week.<br />
<br />
Method had about 350 pulls I believe and I am not surprised if Limit had over 600 pulls.<br />

Nerfs mid week or even between pulls is nothing new.</div></div><hr />

<br />
530 pulls for limit.<br />
<br />
Hard to look just at pull count's though, the first 150~ of limit's pull's were made pointless once the nerf's happened from a comparison pov. Since 50 to 100~ of those pulls were up against a unkillable phase (in week 2 gear).<br />

Not doable in a realistic scenario in week 2 gear. The blizz internal raid team is not as good as these guilds. We don't know exactly but best guess is that they do each phase piece meal in the expected gear level's, so in theory the fight is doable but in practise it doesn't work out that way.</div></div><hr />

You know that the raid comp for Method actually included every single class? That's right all 12 classes where in the world 1st kill.<br />

Ahh so they boosted the benthic gear, so most(?) of the gear dropping from mythic wouldn't have been an upgrade and/or slight upgrade to where it wouldn't provide said dps gains needed.<br />

Pretty much, yes. The added ilvl from the mythic gear will not add enough to trump the bonuses that you get on benthic for the most part.</div></div><hr />

Err as soon as the nerf went out that made that 16 hour head start mean absolutely nothing. <br />
<br />
As far as the nerf's, they were announced ahead of time, both guilds knew when they were launching and method COULD have altered it's raiding schedule if it wanted too. They didn't. It ended up being about 8 hours anyway, or less than half a day by CHOICE. Unlike the Raid opening times, the nerf's went live at the same time on both regions making it completely irrelevant.<br />
<br />
There is no doubt method was better, they did win, but limit were close and did have a opportunity to win, they were just not quite good enough. They are still a threat though.</div></div><hr />

The same way you probably enjoys watching well funded teams with several championships trying another cup. &quot;Is anyone really that eager to watch over 100 minutes of &lt;sport&gt; to score the same points?&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
That is not exactly &quot;overtuning&quot;, this game is still the type of game where you keep farming gear to improve your overall power to overcome the gear checks.<br />
<br />
The thing is that for this &quot;race to world first&quot; product to work out, the bosses now need to be &quot;doable&quot; with very marginal gear improvement over the last top tier.<br />
<br />
For the game itself, the boss wasn't overtuned as that enrage timer would be done with enough mythic gear from the raid in a few weeks.<br />
<br />
Don't make assumptions of people you don't know. I find watching sports incredibly boring as well, but at least there it's an element of direct competition with teams directly pitting their skills against one another and not against an AI controlled boss. Frankly I would much rather play a sport or play a game than sit on my ass watching other people play for hours on end.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sastank</div><div class="date">2019-07-29, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Both sides were equally toxic. Limit actively banned anyone talking bad about Method on their streams and told their viewers to stop being toxic because they were legit just playing a game. Limit were fantastic to watch during this race because their guild was clearly just having fun with each other and making fun of the situation. I found Method kept coming across as the competition was the only thing that mattered. Plenty of members actively talked down about Limit and you could see they were heavily frustrated at missing out on Za'qul right after calling everyone in Limit idiots. Their frustration around mistiming their split raids was hugely apparent.<br />
So I'd say both communities were equally as toxic, but Limit clearly had the best attitude. It ended up being a meme on the Limit side of sharing angry messages, mainly revolving around being a &quot;victim mentality&quot; guild and use of &quot;gamer words&quot; as they put it. That being said there were also plenty of fun moments in both streams, Method had some great casters and Limit had some funny banter. Here's hoping Method and Redbull can sort out their differences or better yet more sponsors can sign on with Blizzard getting involved to create a proper race of the best guilds with equal opportunity for both players (save the US guilds beta testing all the fights like always).<br />
<br />
The competition is what mattered. If anyone from any guild said otherwise, they're flat out lying. It's why they flew out and let Redbull run things. This wasn't a &quot;NA First race&quot; it was World. Limit said themselves they were tryharding for WF last tier and were confident yadda yadda yadda. Their outside appearance may not reflect how seriously they took it but they took it just as seriously as Method. And Method members who were on couch said they joke and have a good time until it comes to progression parts of fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When such a world 1st race occurs you can actually learn quite a lot from it as a developer. A boss should be tuned that a pro player can kill it with less than optimal gear. This means that a more casual player can kill it with (nearly) perfect gear. If you can balance your raids that way you'll have developed an incentive for both parties to play in a raid. If the bosses were too easy the pro players wouldn't play it anymore because what's the point. If it were too hard the casual player base would stop playing. If the casual players stop playing WoW loses the majority of players. So they had to nerf Azshara.<br />
<br />
Regarding the difficulty of the raid:<br />
None of Blizz's employees are pro players. So they have to guess what is an appropriate difficulty level. It's more important that they recognize a mistake and fix it instead of not making that mistake in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Something on this.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has said that Eternal Palace was balanced for a HoA with 1 major/1 minor. In Legion, poorly estimating how much players would grind essentially cost them Emerald Nightmare. If these guilds felt there was a brick wall then we'd see even crazier AP grinding so they could reach 65 and the damage buff would be quite significant.<br />
And really, Benthic gear. It's broken. We are talking about 3-4 slots that are locked for this raid for some specs.</div></div><hr />

I don't watch streams of any kind or e-sports because I find the whole concept silly. I also don't follow world first races outside of what's written on mmo champ. But even someone like me can see that things change.<br />

Only a couple decades ago games were seen as something for kids only, a waste of time for geeks and now look how it's evolved. Everyone plays something, people make loads of money of it, people watch competitions like they would sports matches and now even known companies have started to invest and sponsor such events.<br />
<br />
It's naive to think games won't develop into something bigger and other companies won't try to tap into this market and make more money off it. It's entertainment, it's bound to get big.

It was pretty salty and funny though that limits stream went from follower only chat &gt; sub only chat (Cause method WF and salt ensured) &gt; needing to be followers for 2 weeks only chat.<br />
That kind of shows the mentality of limit.<br />
