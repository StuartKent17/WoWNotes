Warlords of Draenor - Draenei Guard Armor Set<br />
It seems that players may not be able to get this set, as it appears to be intended for NPCs.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Racials<br />
Noticing undead racials only ones useless to healers, any plans to change that? Touch of grave restore mana on heal cast etc?<br />
Yeah, Undead for Healers is on our list to look at. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452035468159250433))<br />
<br />
do races still have bonuses to professions or has that been removed?<br />
They still have them. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452133965218848768))<br />
<br />
What's the logic behind making Arcane Torrent give pally's 1 HP, but priests &amp; monks 3% mana?<br />
It's 1 Chi for Monks, and Priests have no secondary resource. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452180114642452481))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
with all this changes its safe to say that encounters will be tunned for low burst/low inevitable damage?<br />
LowER damage, yes. We'll tune around healers' potential. There's still room for scary burst moments, with time to recover after. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452115423178153984))<br />
<br />
Sorry if you answered, but what is the reason for less crit on int users, but more on agi?<br />
Fits their theme better, and is consistent with how they have been for 9+ years. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452147125434851328))<br />
<br />
Bigger change: Active mitigation for tanks in Cata/MoP, or coming healer changes in WoD?<br />
Active Mitigation for tanks. That fundamentally changed how you tank; healing changes are more about pace. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452179800539418624))<br />
<br />
small question , if I may - on Garrosh kills, often tank contributes a /huge/ amnt of dmg, certainly in phase one.. how (1/2)<br />
Tank damage will still be significant, as described in the paragraph above Resolve. We're increasing their base damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452186308799000577))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
Will repeated Rune Taps and Strike increase the size of the Rune Shield like Blood Shield currently?<br />
Yes, successive Rune Strikes and Rune Taps add to the size of a Rune Shield. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452135816341385216))<br />
<br />
More! Frost DK, Perks improve Razorice/Cinderglacier, 2h currently uses neither (favoring Fallen Crusader). Changing that?<br />
Yeah, we're going to try mixing up which runeforges Frost uses. Realize that that's a big change, and what you see isn't enough. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452148212552306688))<br />
Interesting. Going to be a playstyle thing, or more &quot;x rune required for x type of fight&quot;?<br />
Current plan is Cinderglacier for 2H, Cinderglacier+Razorice for DW. Definitely not set in stone. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452148689352417280))<br />
<br />
Blood DK 3 shields? Blood Shield, Rune Shield &amp; Rune Tap shield?<br />
Rune Shield is one shield shared by Rune Tap (huge) and Rune Strike (tiny). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452021320008470528))<br />
Rune Strike just provides a more frequent, steady stream of little shields. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452021427219091456))<br />
I personally was a huge fan of the reactive active mitigation that DKs had<br />
It's still there. It's done transparently through Resolve, instead of being an opaque mechanic specific to DStrike (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452136105291173889))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s))<br />
Will ravage (feral) still need facing requirement? Nice change for ambush, backstab, and shred BTW.<br />
I believe it is the same for ravage. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/452144744294928384))<br />
Yes, same for Ravage. I'll get that added to the notes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452144841170751488))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
Any chance of survival becoming a multi-dot spec?<br />
You can apply Serpent Sting on multiple mobs, so it is in a way. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452022001037635585))<br />
<br />
Disarm Trap. Just the spell is being removed? Or the entire ability to disarm traps (e.g., by right-clicking on them)?<br />
Disarm Trap completely removed. Detect Trap is staying for now. Reasoning is because of the PvP disarmament. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452178748058525696))<br />
<br />
skimmed hunter sections of notes, can't help but feel gutted. Lots of utility gone; just another dps in the crowd.<br />
You are the only ranged DPS class who can do everything on the move, for starters. What are the main abilities you'll miss? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/451936974140493825))<br />
Scatter S &amp; Distracting S are big, Widow Venom less so. Silence S gone include Counter S? HMark nice flavor but not critical.<br />
What is the everyday use of Distracting Shot that you're going to miss most? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452107024076009472))<br />
<br />
Distracting shot is the only thing I'll miss... so nice on Heroic LK 25 solo to get the adds on me so I won't be dropped off <br />
That's something we can (and will) fix on the encounter logic side. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452106214453682177))<br />
<br />
Scatter S &amp; Distracting S are big, Widow Venom less so. Silence S gone include Counter S? HMark nice flavor but not critical.<br />
No, you keep Counter Shot. Scatter/Silence were removed as part of overall CC disarmament. Nearly everyone lost something. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452106839006535683))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br />
Will the new Mirror Images mimic mage's spell casting or just cast filter spells? If mimic, big DPS CD; if not, very weak.<br />
It's a big DPS CD. They cast spec-appropriate spells, and hit hard. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452029335000453120))<br />
So they have a set rotation but won't mimic your own spell casting?<br />
Correct. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030044378902528))<br />
<br />
Flameglow also feels like something we'd never use, not sure if you have any plans to modify it, or just leave it as is.<br />
Flameglow shines in the case where you're taking frequent little hits of damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452212087779885056))<br />
<br />
PoM... what will we use it with? AB? Maybe we could make it give us some kind of buff, or do something different?<br />
Mostly Arcane Blast. Occasionally a couple other things. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452211986076430336))<br />
You didn't consider changing it, or just cutting it? High-haste AB... it'll be useless, not sure why we're keeping it.<br />
It's definitely not useless... Faster, and usable while moving. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452214371968487424))<br />
<br />
Sad that evo is arcane-only now. I liked the glyph as fire.<br />
Glyph boils down to a cooldown-heal, which is cool (and I liked too). Doesn't necessarily need to be tied to evoc. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/451911723327299585))<br />
How do fire/frost regen mana?<br />
Do you find yourself low on mana at any point nowadays? Making mana more interesting would be great, big change tho (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/452132573712355329))<br />
I like the evo-heal as a PvP mage, too. But hey I'll get over it <br />
We turned the Glyph of Evocation heal into Glyph of Ice Block, which attaches that same heal to Ice Block. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452134120533942272))<br />
Is that Ice Block heal an HOT (cancel Ice Block early, no full heal), or instant?<br />
Same HoT as Glyph of Evo had. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452142047533621248))<br />
any way to counter that? At least on live, we can kick/cc the evo. Maybe allow MD to remove block and heal?<br />
Mass Dispel does break Ice Block in 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452186836740227072))<br />
<br />
Do Frost bomb pulses triggered by Ice Lance still snare targets?<br />
No. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452180741858656256))<br />
<br />
really hoping for some clarification on what brain freeze is getting turned into<br />
Still going to make it treat the target as frozen, and increase damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452183997053808640))<br />
<br />
Incanter's Flow is: 5-10-15-20-25-20-15-10-5 and back up, or does it go down to 0?<br />
5-10-15-20-25-25-20-15-10-5-repeat. Yes, that may be OP compared to Rune at current tuning. Tuning process comes later. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452184540966973440))<br />
<br />
Is Water Jets inteded usage for PvE when the nova can't trigger FoF on Bosses?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452146885768146944))<br />
<br />
brain freeze going to be hitting harder relevant to other mage spells to make up for added cast time?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452152636163117056))<br />
<br />
Very happy to see deepfreeze gone from fire, but I won't be able to have knockback blastwave+ living bomb? :/<br />
Correct. One or the other. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030828856348674))<br />
Will there be a knockback version of blastwave? Liked it much better than the daze effect one.<br />
Supernova does a knock up, but no knockback. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452031386874937344))<br />
<br />
I never liked running and casting, but yeah it's only the filler. What about scorch? Won't be useable on the move right?<br />
Scorch will. Mages are fairly light on ability to cast while moving (well, Fire/Arcane anyway). Scorch's damage is low. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452037580217778176))<br />
<br />
Are Dragon's Breath/Cone of Cold going to be AoE DPS increases in Warlords? Or just utility spells?<br />
Yes, significant DPS value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452155638781456384))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
Question about Mistweaver monks: How high is the DPS going to be in another stance? Can I fulfill DD role in raid permanently?<br />
Exact numbers TBD, but no - someone equal to a pure DPS who could stance swap to be a full healer would be too good. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452116529677488128))<br />
<br />
If you keep that up people can't do anything when taking damage and can do it all when taking little. No counterplay.<br />
We did add countering gameplay to Fists of Fury. If you break the stun, it will not restun you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452175773034508288))<br />
<br />
Brewmaster monks have found a niche in raiding as the &quot;high dps tanks&quot;. Will we still bring that utility in WoD?<br />
They had that niche briefly, especially around 5.2, but that hasn't really been the case since then. All tank dmg will be equal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452194001362227200))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
Prot paladin losing Aven Wrath - does this also mean no more wings? As its symbolic of the paladin in my view<br />
We hear ya on the feedback about the Wings visual. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452031942750253056))<br />
<br />
Please don't forget the rets, taking 30% of your damage and GoAKis going to ruining our dps that is not already so good<br />
Rest easy, we haven't done a damage tuning pass yet. Those are design changes, not balance changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452153127131557888))<br />
<br />
Empowered Seals paladin talent. Seal juggling viable again? And can we get more than one buff from this active at same time?<br />
Yes. That is explicitly a talent to opt into seal twisting. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452161125535076352))<br />
I thought it was still just called stance dancing<br />
&quot;Dancing&quot; refers to swapping states to use an ability you can only use in that state. &quot;Twisting&quot; refers to mixing states... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452173153209290752))<br />
... back and forth, frequently, in order to gain the benefit of both. #gaminglingo (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452173272784715776))<br />
<br />
Crit/multistrike still useless for Prot Paladins in terms of mitigation? and any changes to Holy Wrath?<br />
No, not useless. Very useful. Stay tuned for next patch notes update. Still considering Holy Wrath changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452028773630611456))<br />
will this include ret stuff?!? Seems very light. Changes to talents? Less cd dependent? Glyphs? Divine storm in ST?<br />
Ret's in a fairly good place right now, design-wise. We think simple number tuning can solve their problems (hasn't happened yet) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030586874363904))<br />
Removing Inquisition negates a lot of our Holy Damage unless compensated elsewhere. Tuning needs to be done soon.<br />
Relax. We will do a damage tuning pass. The sky is not falling. Removing Inquisition is done as a design change, not balance change (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452033022653513728))<br />
<br />
Would I be right in assuming that seraphim is designed to be a &quot;mini burst&quot; cd? Playing into the CD orientated ret gameplay?...<br />
Yes. It's a small frequent CD, that also makes your other CDs more frequent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452035327859761153))<br />
other CDs more frequent? How so? Didn't read that anywhere<br />
With Seraphim, you should typically hit your other cooldowns while Seraphim is active (and so you have more Readiness). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452035978069155840))<br />
readiness reduces my cooldown on my major burst CDs???<br />
That's... exactly what Readiness does, yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452036512889073664))<br />
oh wow! Ok, well if it's going to be temp, how will that effect calculations of CD timers? Seems complicated<br />
While Seraphim is up, your CDs are shorter; ideal to hit them then. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452036981279555584))<br />
when seraphim goes off, the CD goes back up again? What happens if the CD was only 10 secs away with sera, then falls?<br />
At the time that you use a CD, its remaining cooldown is locked it; it doesn't change further. It's pretty intuitive. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452037818081370112))<br />
<br />
A Paladin without Holy Light is no longer a Warcraft Paladin. Uther did not heal people with &quot;Word Of Glory&quot;.<br />
We removed the &quot;cheap, weak heal&quot; -- names will be reassigned to keep the most iconic ones. I agree with you. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/452104939007774721))<br />

Clarity of power will make both Solace and insanity and Divine insight completely useless for singlet target fight. Thoughts?<br />
It definitely will not affect Solace and Insanity. Divine Insight is being changed to proc from something else instead. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452024424565194752))<br />
Sorry, meant for From Darkness, comes light instead of Solace and Insanity. Is this one also getting changed?<br />
Yes. Don't recall the exact change. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452024903730876416))<br />

SW: D removed from disc/holy? Skill-cap of priests reduced by a LARGE amount. This makes no sense<br />
There's a glyph to get back the gameplay you're talking about for Holy/Disc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452027069543628800))<br />
<br />
with aoe capping for lvl 90 priest talents, what they place in rotation? It will cost much, with not so big heals.<br />
They're still high priority, rotationally. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452030131674939392))<br />
<br />
And is that new mastery for Shadow supposed to be the big 'wow, damage!' factor from losing all this utility? No mana hymn?<br />
We cut a ton of abilities from all classes, not just Shadow. Shadow's new Mastery is immensely powerful in choosing ST vs AoE. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451895217763799040))<br />
Have to say, I was looking forward to a ST *talent*, but having to choose AE/ST in gearing DO NOT WANT<br />
Curious, why? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452019128476241920))<br />
Didn't see Mind Sear on that list. Still, would be better through a talent rather than gear. Gear locks you in. Talent doesnt<br />
Gear most certainly does *not* lock you in. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452033649303498752))<br />

Hello, why was Shadow Word: Death removed from healing priests? It's a skillful mechanic in PvP<br />
That mechanic is still there via Glyph of Holy Fire, which gives Holy Fire the self-damage skillshot for Holy/Disc in PvP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452141613498650624))<br />

Is there a chance that Enhanced Premeditation will be scrapped? Being able to control Premeditation is fairly important...<br />
We realize that it has some downside to it, but believe that the power of Enhanced Premeditation, combined with CP being... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452038135635922945))<br />

With backstab not getting changed will hemo be more like cata? Diff in mop hemo &amp; stab 64% cata 16%...<br />
Not sure what you're asking... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452144084715442177))<br />
when you are forced to use hemo the difference in mop from backstab is massive in cata is was a small loss.<br />
Somewhere in between. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452145141759754240))<br />
Could we at least get an explanation on why backstab is now the only positional move in the game? Pls don't say its the name<br />
Because it's a small DPS difference that you can opt into. Fits Subtlety's theme. Shouldn't be usable on something attacking you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452146828436193280))<br />
Shred mangle had this same difference you could opt into and yet. I was really looking forward to sub not being held back..<br />
That wasn't something you could opt into or out of. Backstab is not something that will 'hold back' Subtlety. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/452150468366438400))<br />

Ele takes huge hit to single target with no compensation?Also, no one will use EQ even with the buff.Maybe if it's instant cast.<br />

Another clarifying question: Shocking Lava, is that on casts or hits (ie: will LvB overloads add a charge)?<br />

Mobile LB must stay for Ele. Can't use ES while moving since we need to build stacks. Unleash's damage is bad / being removed.<br />

Ascendance is too good to not use Spiritwalker's with, too. Options would be nice! Maybe revise the lvl45 tier?<br />

That's what it seems like b/c those sets are awful. Some of the worst sets I've ever seen in the game regardless of where they come from.

<br />
Exactly. Like many, I don't have time to raid, so I'm stuck going through LFR for gear and seeing the content. Pre-SoO it was actually okay most days...but once Flex came out along with SoO, LFR has actually become...well, quite a process. I'm trying to think of the right way to word this, as I don't feel I'm entitled to anything that those in normal or guilds are getting...it sucked I wasn't able to try and get a BoA weapon from Garrosh, but such is life.<br />
<br />
Now, unless this has yet to be cleared up (and hopefully it will be soon), these are replacing the tier sets in LFR? I completely agree that Xmog will almost nullify the changes in the end; however, I think it's incredibly silly of Blizzard to do this in the first place. It was nice to be able to get a tier set through LFR, and I think the changes in colours were fine for getting the point across that we're not &quot;actual&quot; raiders, if that's how some want to view it. I just liked having the option to get the set if I chose to wear it.<br />
<br />
If this is the new gear, then as someone mentioned earlier, we might as well just wear random questing gear, as this literally looks like &quot;starting zone&quot; gear for a character. It's so generic and...&quot;pawn&quot; like...you're not a hero in this gear, you're a lowly pawn in the war.<br />
<br />
Again, I know xmog makes it almost a non-existent argument...but if this is how it's going to be, then I'll never even have the option of wearing the tier sets, because I can't raid outside of LFR. I think it's a silly change, and it's a step backwards if they think it'll make people go, &quot;Well, I better actually raid now or I'll look stupid!&quot; because most people running LFR have no other option. <br />
<br />
Plus, when push comes to shove, at least in a raiding guild on Normal, you're experiencing the content with friends and all that. If anything, LFR is just a major headache from start to finish until you eventually make it through. Again, I hope I worded this in a way that doesn't sound whiney...that's not my intention...I just want to have the option of a varied coloured tier gear of the current tier when running said raid -- even if it is just LFR.</div></div><hr />

I know it's subjective, and im not claiming to be the Aesthics Arbiter here, but as a long time Wow player, i've seen many sets. Some iffy, some good, and i think these are actually pretty okay. They aren't bad but not too over the top either. They're simplistic in design, especially plate, mail, and leather (which, ironically is what everybody on MMO-Champion seemed to have been asking for ever since the first datamined gear/weapons were found. Just goes to show how much people just like to hate on things in WoW's shitty community.). All-in-all, They look like the equivalent of questing blues, and seeing that this was DM'd for LFR it's not too concerning. They didn't say it was tier armor so whatevs. Blizz is doing a good job so far despite all the non-constructive criticisms coming out of everybody's buttholes-for-mouths.<br />
<br />
<br />
Still annoys me that Blizz completely forgot what materials look like; everything looks like chunky foam rubber cosplay these days.<br />
You're saying the tattooed on, cardboard armor of Classic - Cata looks better than the armor that actually looks like you're wearing something? While i agree the armor somewhat looks a bit like paper mache, it also looks thick, course, and roughly chiseled, which fits the savage stone-age that is Draenor and is MUCH better and more detailed than most of the paper &amp; paint gear we have now. It's just a design choice that probably looks weird outside of WoW, but will probably fit the environment of Draenor quite well.</div></div><hr />

Have to agree here sadly, I'm not sure what they are thinking with these sets, lackluster is certainly the word I would use. Honestly I thank the gods for transmog, though it seems to me that we shouldn't feel pushed into the whole *oh it's ok we have transmog* when it comes to new expansion sets, we should want to use the new armor sets they give us, but the quality of the designs is just really lacking, if it is intentional for purposes of trying to get people to run Flex and higher, then it may just work, though I am not sure if that's a positive to be fair.</div></div><hr />

It's about both to those who don't have time to do normal raiding. The gear you get from there is better than heroics, but not better than Flex or regular raiding. Therefore, if you can't raid normally, LFR is the best route to go to get gear that will make you feel stronger when fighting rares, or doing heroics again for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
It's not complicated. And there's no reason to make those people look different than others (as they likely spend just as much time inside the raid as those who do it on a schedule...it's just randomly placed throughout the week when it can be fit in.) If someone who only does LFR having a green coloured version of the yellow coloured tier you get for doing regular raiding irks you, then you really should reevaluate your priorities.</div></div><hr />

Heroics and LFR are offering the same ilvl gear if what Blizzard has said so far is to be trusted, so no, it isn't the most timely. The time argument itself is BS unless you are a tank or healer. 45 minute queues to get in 1-3 hours to complete 1 wing. Don't tell me that is faster than my heroic clears of ToT which take 1-2 hours tops. Blizzard is doing what they should have done from the start, remove it from the gear race and make it a tool to see the raiding content for people who do not get to raid (or do not have the &quot;time&quot;)</div></div><hr />

I'm on board with this sentiment. I'm a super casual player, in that I don't do scheduled raids/etc like I used to (gogo lack of free time). <br />
I like, and hate, LFR. <br />
I like that a slow pace player, like me, can run LFR and 'see' the content while competing with similiar/better DPS in recount and learning the base set of do's and don'ts.<br />
I hate that people think they can suck in LFR (if Blizz would check player gear for lack of gems/enchants, that'd solve a lot of care-not issues) without recourse. At least TRY. Every bit counts, even in LFR.<br />
<br />
But... what I got out of LFR was the urge and contrast against other similarly geared players performance, to try Flex (via OQueue), which I did about 2 months ago. <br />
<br />
LOVED IT. LOOOOOOOOVED it. More difficult/twitchy and 80%+ of the people in them knew their class and were 'good' and if you repeatedly faltered for simple things, you were booted to keep the group pressing forward. I got in faster than LFR Q's, the run was faster and the people were like minded in their goal (kill shit effectively). Gear seemed to drop faster compared to LFR too.<br />
<br />
Then, a few weeks ago, I tried 10Normal (via OQueue) after replacing most of my LFR/TI gear in Flex to increase my odds of getting in and dutifully performing.<br />
LOOOOOOVED it. Top 1-3 on Boss DPS usually so I felt the effort in to my character was deserved, like the good 'ol days of guild runs and Flex prepared me well enough that any differences I could wing (or had read about). That encouraged me to make Flex, and now, Normal part of my free-time routine and all but abandon LFR (except for Garrosh, who holds a trinket I desire, but I do LFR last now...). I still have half the bosses to down on Normal and look forward to the challenge. <br />
<br />
I think this was Blizzards goal - LFR was a stepping stone, if you wanted it, to better reward - not a perpetual cab ride where you don't pay your fare (as it seems to be). So poor looking gear, etc is a-ok with me (transmog moots that anyway). I think the idea of LFR as a boot camp for raid mechanics (simplified), then Flex as the gateway to Normal was GREAT. If they distill that to LFR and Flex==Normal in WoD then FANTASTIC. They just need to moderate the jump from LFR to the new Normal so cross realm groups and lack of vent (sometimes) doesn't discourage learning and/or learn-by-youtube mentality (i.e. more/all mechanics between the two, just lower the impact perhaps). Wiping is part of the fun when you learn from it.</div></div><hr />

So...by your (bad) logic, you would be totally okay if these armor sets were for Heroic only, but offered amazing stats? I mean, Heroic's all about the difficulty, and desire to feel &quot;superior&quot; to your fellow players, right? So why should you care if your armor sets on Heroic look absolutely terrible, so long as you have the stats on them, and you're completing top-end difficulty.<br />
<br />
There's zero reason why armor can't both look aesthetically pleasing and have inferior stats. You are simply grasping at straws to try and make yourself seem the better to those that choose to play at a lower difficulty than you.</div></div><hr />

They just need to moderate the jump from LFR to the new Normal so cross realm groups and lack of vent (sometimes) doesn't discourage learning and/or learn-by-youtube mentality (i.e. more/all mechanics between the two, just lower the impact perhaps). Wiping is part of the fun when you learn from it.<br />
This person is why this entire change is being done. He/She Graduated. He/She understands why they are doing it. Its not to &quot;Final Solution&quot; the LFR Heroes. It is a solution to help get the Flex Community going more and jump starting servers and getting the community moving. This solution makes quite a bit of sense when you actually think about it, unlike flying I really cannot think of very many valid arguments against the changes, this is just a change that needs to happen. LFR is in a bad state for everyone, griefing and afkers everywhere, lack of fight mechanic explanation, lack of &quot;fun.&quot; LFR has to change to adjust for Flex and LFR will be adjusting to Flex, that is why this change is coming.<br />

So...by your (bad) logic, you would be totally okay if these armor sets were for Heroic only, but offered amazing stats? I mean, Heroic's all about the difficulty, and desire to feel &quot;superior&quot; to your fellow players, right? So why should you care if your armor sets on Heroic look absolutely terrible, so long as you have the stats on them, and you're completing top-end difficulty.<br />
<br />
There's zero reason why armor can't both look aesthetically pleasing and have inferior stats. You are simply grasping at straws to try and make yourself seem the better to those that choose to play at a lower difficulty than you.<br />
<br />
I love how you call my logic bad, its cute :3<br />
<br />
You have literally no clue what makes heroic, heroic. It has nothing to do with gear. People who play for any gear, be it PvP, LFR, Heroic, Mythic, Dungeon, any gear, are the worst kinds of players, they play for the ilvl. Heroic is meant to be heroic, thats what the point of heroic is. When I kill a boss in LFR I do not feel, and I do not know ANYONE that feels like they did something amazing when the boss dies. I do not give two flying shits what my gear looks like, I could be naked. My gear could have no stats, but if I can kill hard heroic bosses, then you can bet my ass I will feel great and feel like I did something good. Raiding in WoW is not about gear, but because of bad seeds that is what it has become, because of that Blizzard is having to take drastic steps to prevent it from going any further. To say I am grasping at straws is also incredibly stupid. You are calling me names and saying I am grasping at straws while I argue my points, its the exact opposite in fact, you are grasping at straws here, not me. In response to the aethetics argument, thats subjective, its your opinion on how it looks. I would love to have that Mail set on a hunter and I would love to have that Leather set on a Monk.</div></div><hr />

You do realise that it takes less time to find a group of ppl and run flex than it does to queue up for LFR? I can guarantee the runs will be smoother and who knows you might make some friends.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chezwickcheese</div><div class="date">2014-04-28, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly. Like many, I don't have time to raid, so I'm stuck going through LFR for gear and seeing the content. Pre-SoO it was actually okay most days...but once Flex came out along with SoO, LFR has actually become...well, quite a process. I'm trying to think of the right way to word this, as I don't feel I'm entitled to anything that those in normal or guilds are getting...it sucked I wasn't able to try and get a BoA weapon from Garrosh, but such is life.<br />
<br />
Now, unless this has yet to be cleared up (and hopefully it will be soon), these are replacing the tier sets in LFR? I completely agree that Xmog will almost nullify the changes in the end; however, I think it's incredibly silly of Blizzard to do this in the first place. It was nice to be able to get a tier set through LFR, and I think the changes in colours were fine for getting the point across that we're not &quot;actual&quot; raiders, if that's how some want to view it. I just liked having the option to get the set if I chose to wear it.<br />
<br />
If this is the new gear, then as someone mentioned earlier, we might as well just wear random questing gear, as this literally looks like &quot;starting zone&quot; gear for a character. It's so generic and...&quot;pawn&quot; like...you're not a hero in this gear, you're a lowly pawn in the war.<br />
<br />
Again, I know xmog makes it almost a non-existent argument...but if this is how it's going to be, then I'll never even have the option of wearing the tier sets, because I can't raid outside of LFR. I think it's a silly change, and it's a step backwards if they think it'll make people go, &quot;Well, I better actually raid now or I'll look stupid!&quot; because most people running LFR have no other option. <br />
<br />
Plus, when push comes to shove, at least in a raiding guild on Normal, you're experiencing the content with friends and all that. If anything, LFR is just a major headache from start to finish until you eventually make it through. Again, I hope I worded this in a way that doesn't sound whiney...that's not my intention...I just want to have the option of a varied coloured tier gear of the current tier when running said raid -- even if it is just LFR.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I just cannot accept that you do not have time for flex raiding. It takes less time than LFR! You sound like you don't want to put any effort in at all and want free epic tier gear. Flex is very easy and is a great way to engage with your guild and server/servers.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone has the same experiences, for me I could get into a LFR in like 10-15 minutes, do a wing in 30-40 mins and log off, thats less than an hour, of no hassle raiding, a bit of progression and fun. <br />
<br />
Flex I have never gotten a group together for Flex in less than 30-40 minutes sometimes longer. and there always seems to be so much more drama in those groups. <br />

<br />
To be honest, Flex isn't something I've tried much, mainly because I haven't played too often in the past few months...maybe longer. I'll log in, but I mean, there's only so much SoO you can do. That said, when SoO first came out, Flex wasn't faster than LFR...at least on my server...and groups would fall apart fairly early. This was likely due to the fact that many were used to LFR, and not actually making strategies. Maybe it changed a few months later, and maybe it's stabilized more now, and if that's the case, then maybe I'll aim for that come WoD and see if it's changed.<br />
<br />
That said, regardless of whether you run the old LFR, the new LFR, Flex, or normal raiding...it's all &quot;effort&quot;...and no epics are free. Just because LFR may be considered easier, doesn't mean you're not investing time and frustration in its own right. I really hate it when people say others want &quot;free&quot; epics when talking about various raiding difficulties, because that argument is only valid if someone said, &quot;Man, I have no time to raid, I wish when I logged in my mailbox had some epics for me in it too!&quot; That's free epics without effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trust me, those who run LFR get even more frustrated with those who go afk during fights than those who feel they get the same bonuses as heroic gear for doing nothing. You might think that LFR is easy enough to do without them (and maybe it's easier now after countless nerfs) but it's only doable after a handful of wipes, where you get your stacks up to make the fight easier for those who are actually trying.<br />
<br />
One of the worst changes Blizzard has made is putting a cap on the amount of times you can kick people. I'm not sure if that's changed, but I remember during SoO early on, it would basically block you from kicking people after you'd done it a certain number of times a week. This basically made it so there was nothing you could do but let them afk through it. That's a change I'd like to see taken away...it'd be some extreme cases where people would exploit having free reign to kick people as often as they wanted. Only bad or rude players are constantly kicked, and they deserve no rights passed down by Blizzard to make it so there's nothing other players can do about them.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. They just want the armor to differ between LFR and Normal(I don't think that's necessary but whatever floats their boat).<br />

Still, they've certainly attempted to make it less desired than raid gear above LFR.</div></div><hr />

And while the obvious benefit has been the increased itemlevel (between my ilvl 546 warlock and anything else above 565+ was a huge difference in damage output) and a different coloring of the same items, I deem this has not been enough for you guys? You need to be more special, is that it? Or do you want LFR-players to be purposfully looking bad (lets not consider transmog at that point)?

Loathe the Rogue set, though. If at least one even fit the &quot;standard&quot; rogue coloration, it'd be fine, but... Olive? White? Violet? VIOLET?! That's like the exact opposite of stealth. That's a big flag that says &quot;I'm over here! Stab me in the face!&quot;<br />
<br />
Also wish there was more &quot;uniformity&quot; to the asymmetry. Just once I'd love to see a set of gloves that only comes with one glove, and the Rogue LFR set would've been perfect for that.</div></div><hr />

Really, I don't care if LFR drops pebbles for loot. My issue isn't LFR changing. It's wannabe hardcores' obsession with having to look superior to those who only do LFR, even though they already do.

We start here, by making the LFR gear look different from actual Raid Tier: what the next step is, I don't pretend to know, but I assume the end goal is &quot;remove LFR entirely using the decreasing number of people using it as an excuse to cut back on player backlash, rather than just saying &quot;fuck you it's our game we'll remove it if we want&quot;.&quot;<br />

Much like you, I have no idea where they're going from here. But I agree that they intend to make LFR less attractive compared to the alternatives. But I completely disagree that it isn't related to the so-called wannabe hardcores that this decision was made. Remember the collective crying group you mentioned? There's a very loud one that has been whining about LFR from the week it was implemented. I wonder if Blizzard really did make this decision on their own, or as a kneejerk reaction to this whining. Much like other decisions they made in the past that ended up backfiring, not because the decisions were bad (I don't disagree with this one, either), but because the players didn't take it well. Which I fully expect to happen again.<br />
<br />
In the end what I mean to say is, I don't disagree with the decision, I disagree with the &quot;why&quot;, and I have my doubts that it'll sit well with the majority of the playerbase in the long run.</div></div><hr />

They seem to be a sort of punishment rather than reward. So I assume that Blizzard would intent to imply those hard-core players a philosophy----defeating all the bosses in a heroic raid doesn't make one a hero, but conversely, could probably reveal the fact that one is a loser in the world outside of WoW. Isn't that very enlightening?</div></div><hr />

I haven't been paying close attention to twitter feeds and news, so perhaps Blizz has explained otherwise, but I really can't see them sticking LFR players with ugly gear in order to make &quot;real raiders&quot; feel less insecure.</div></div><hr />

They say they want more people out in the world, then implement an instanced zone just for you (Garrison's).<br />
They say they want more people to experience raids, then start phasing out the option that they provided.<br />
They say they want to push content out faster, then we get a long final patch before an expansion.<br />

Heroic mode raider checking in, I 100% agree with the other guy. A large (or at least vocal) population of raiders really seem to need a highly visible superiority to everybody not as accomplished as they are. These are the same people who would really prefer it if nothing even dropped epics except for the very hardest setting. These are the same people who want nothing more than to afk at the AH mailbox on their special mounts in their special armor, thinking people will be amazed. <br />
<br />
And honestly, I remember being amazed, back in vanilla when I wasn't even sure what a raid was. It didn't last long but some people have never wanted to let that go. We're no longer amazed, we just think those people are douchebags.<br />
<br />
Maybe they're really excited that since Blizzard is officially out of ideas and is taking us back to vanilla mode (squish, time travel to past, no flying like it's 8 years ago, etc.) they'll be able to recapture their lost glory. Maybe they're right! If so, we'll see 'em at the mailbox, and will still think that they're douchebags.</div></div><hr />

So when the hardcores complain about having no reward (look better) for doing the hardest content, the casuals say well if they aren't happy they can quit. <br />
<br />
But when the casuals get gear with the same stats that just looks uglier then what? If they don't like it they can quit, right? But they won't quit because there isn't another game out there made stupid enough for the WoW casual players.</div></div><hr />

Because people want a reason to not feel they have to transmog their gear. Shaman- for example- the only set I've liked on them since LK was the tier 11 tier set. Otherwise, I haven't seen a set I actually liked in a very long time that's made me not want to change the appearance.</div></div><hr />

Remember that MSV didn't have tier loot, so chances are that's the same thing happening here. The first raid of WoD may not have tier loot, so nobody is having &quot;tier gear handed to them&quot;, LFR or otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever done raid finder, special snowflake?<br />
<br />
It's the same as a regular raid but with more people and slightly easier mechanics.<br />
<br />
You're still joining up with 24 other RANDOM people and relying on them to do their job correctly in order to defeat the boss. Half the time they don't but you still stick around anyway.<br />
<br />
It's not different than flex or normal with the exception of reduced mechanics. No matter what raid you step into you are still relying on other people to do their jobs correctly. It's not like you just queue for raid finder, enter an instance by yourself, and talk to an npc who hands out tier. Half the time it takes weeks and weeks to win something.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand why people are so butthurt about other people getting a different color variation of the only armor sets Blizzard puts even a slight amount of effort into during a patch cycle or expansion launch. Tier sets are the only unique and &quot;thought out&quot; armor we're going to have access to for months aside from pvp gear. It's not fair for people to have to spam OQueue or trade chat looking for whoever is desperate enough to invite somebody that doesn't already have full heroic gear for flex wing 1 just because they want some new different looking gear. Blizzard should be creating more and it wouldn't be that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
<br />
And either way, the tier gear has the big green &quot;RAID FINDER&quot; on the tooltip, so it's not like people are going to mistake your hard earned tier for that of the tier belonging to those damn retarded lazy casuals that get free epics for paying 15 dollars a month.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand this crowd of &quot;hardcores.&quot; If you want to be hardcore and feel like you accomplished something then go out in the real world and accomplish something in real life. Do Crossfit, win a nobel peace prize, get a job, learn how to talk to girls, bathe.<br />
<br />
Nobody cares that you've earned your hardcore leet epics from killing a non-raid finder difficulty of Garrosh. NOBODY CARES. There is always somebody in the game who will have killed a higher difficulty than you, have better gear than you, and be a better player than you. So get over yourselves.</div></div><hr />

Can't disagree with this more. The community wants to believe that it 'wasn't to gear up&quot; but for those of us who ran it, and can ONLY run it, it was our BEST chance to gear up. It wasn't as good as the Normal/Heroic types but it was better such that we could then have fun killing rares and such around the world (particularly in MoP). <br />
<br />
It's just so elitest and BS to be like &quot;it wasn't a means to gear up&quot;. This comment is annoying since clearly, since LFR was added, the gear in it was better than Heroic gear from 5-mans. The fact that Blizzard caved to the elitest whiners is actually a sad day for World of Warcraft since I assure you this group is far smaller than that which actually raids LFR and enjoys getting better gear than they have for doing so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-Zo-</div><div class="date">2014-04-28, 09:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh, not liking the look of those sets. Hard for me to pin down what it is though. Partly, that mail helm with the &quot;mask&quot;, dear god, why? I don't understand the fixation on cluttering the helm area. Just made a damn hood, that'd be fine. Helms have been terrible for a long time, like, to the point where I think they put the intern artists on helm duty. They're almost always too much, I mean, the conical hat of the monk sets is a good example. It's not enough to have a simple hat (befitting the monk class), they have to add some ginormous, gaudy, necklace to it. Blizzard, less is more for helms. Except maybe plate, but even those kind of all blur together to me. <br />
<br />
Except you know what, the helms you could buy from the blizzard store, were really cool. More of that level of art for your actual game please Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Not a big fan of the single, huge, pauldron styles either. I can't imagine how bad that thing will clip a gnome.<br />
<br />
Overall, I think I kind of figured it out -- these lack a good theme. They're trying a little bit - the furry cloth, the heavy plate. But the colors, the drabness, the sharply delineated different parts and lack of interesting theme conspire to make these forgettable and yet another set hidden behind early tier beauty.<br />
<br />
And I did wear a few sets from MoP without transmog - the green monk set, the white/gold monk set were both pretty nice imo, at least on a female panda ;) less the terrible helms of course. Give me a tiller's straw hat over that other crap any day. :) or felheart horns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seem almost unreal that Blizzard devs never ever tried to expand the idea behind &quot;dungeon tiers&quot;. They rather &quot;thrown&quot; wellfare epic at players only to please them!<br />
<br />
Starting in BC and especially in WotLK Blizz devs just made wellfare epics for everybody.<br />
<br />
Why not expand the &quot;dungeon tier&quot; gear and make it exclusively as &quot;rare&quot; / &quot;blue gear&quot; alongside &quot;epics&quot; / &quot;purples&quot;.<br />
<br />
They would both increase in ilevel and LFR would give the best possible &quot;rare / blue&quot; gear?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghosting</div><div class="date">2014-04-28, 10:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Amazed at all the people complaining about the ugly LFR sets. The Warrior and Paladin tier sets were in previous posts if you want to see where the all the talent is at.<br />
<br />
Also, what's with blaming the shitty looking welfare gear on hardcore players wanting to look like special snowflakes? It's not like hardcore players are somehow holding you back from doing the content and getting the gear yourself. I'm in a heroic raid guild, they don't care what the hell your running around in. Almost everyone in the guild runs around in transmog anyways. If you really want that &quot;look&quot;, then spend the time to do it. Complaining about it just means you don't want to spend the time for that &quot;look&quot;, that you obviously want, since your complaining. Plus, do you really want transmog worthy LFR gear that you won't have access to once you out level the content?<br />
<br />
For anyone looking to bash me. I don't raid, and I don't pvp. I only played 3 months out of the entire MoP expansion and the first month was free. What did I do? Spent my time doing LFR (to make soloing old content easier) then transmogging the ugly away. Occasionally camped the black market auction house to pimp my pally out with Dreadnaught gear. Just so I could mess with peoples' heads as I ride around on a dead horse and fear people with the Turn Evil talent. Also to appear as the angel of death, as I slow fall with Avenging Wrath popped, slowly approaching their future corpse. (Note: I suck at PvP, so it mostly ends up being my corpse, sometimes while I'm still in the air :P)</div></div><hr />

The stratification of the player base, no flying. I can't wait for all the griefing, ganking, increased competition for mobs and resources and the elite saying &quot;Deal with it&quot; while most will unsub. Just like the start of Cata. Shame we have to repeat this cycle again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Brytallica</div><div class="date">2014-04-29, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard really has a hard time making leather armor for someone reason. As someone who has played a rogue since BC, I've hated most of the leather armor sets since T8 because none of the sets look like leather! I do love the look of the WoD armor in general in that you can see the details of the layering and it doesn't look like flat textures. Out of the alpha previews so far, I like mail armor and there is potential with the plate armor. Why is there is metal on the shoulders of leather armor? Is that grey leather or supposed to be some type of mail/leather hybrid on the chest and boots? I would love in WoD if they brought back some of the level 60 and 70 leather armor sets but with the better quality resolution. I once remember seeing an artist concept sketch of T8 armor which looks amazing but the model in game falls flat.</div></div><hr />

And if you scrubs truly hate the design, maybe its time to stop grinding this game for free loot and actually try to accomplish something in normal/hc raids</div></div><hr />

How do they expect me to do it later?<br />
<br />
Believe me I've tried to get into flex through open raid too, but getting chosen is almost impossible.</div></div><hr />

This crap is pissing me off, with all this cool Tech Wow has blizzard continues to animate such terrible and bland armor.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PrimoSupreme</div><div class="date">2014-04-30, 08:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i like the draenei guard armor set if its plate i hope they change there mind to not just make it for the NPC's :(</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beet</div><div class="date">2014-05-01, 05:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I actually hope that the sets aren't incorrectly labeled because that Mail set looks awesome. I love the helmet especially. I definitely think the people calling these the ugliest sets ever are way off base. The mail set is very cool and the helmet is unique. The plate set is nice too.<br />
<br />
I will give you that the cloth set is disgusting though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sodia</div><div class="date">2014-05-01, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...by your (bad) logic, you would be totally okay if these armor sets were for Heroic only, but offered amazing stats? I mean, Heroic's all about the difficulty, and desire to feel &quot;superior&quot; to your fellow players, right? So why should you care if your armor sets on Heroic look absolutely terrible, so long as you have the stats on them, and you're completing top-end difficulty.<br />
<br />
There's zero reason why armor can't both look aesthetically pleasing and have inferior stats. You are simply grasping at straws to try and make yourself seem the better to those that choose to play at a lower difficulty than you.<br />
<br />
Yes !! this is exacly not true !! You pay 12 $ for access to the game and how you spend your time is up to you, if you have time and you ar ambicius you do Heroic Raiding or Hig End PvP for witch you ar revered with cool lookin gear mounts and other things , ppl that play 1 h a day or les gues whot??! they got les then the others!! thats how life is not every one can be winers.Btw if you play 12 h a day and youre stil on lfr level then riding is not for you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tazr</div><div class="date">2014-05-01, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stats aside, why even waste time designing such boring, even ugly crap? If the attitude is that people can xmog to make it go away, then they need to smarten up and stop wasting resources coming up with new, WORSE armor very few people will want and the majority will just xmog over. Plenty of perfectly decent old designs to reuse...better yet, use those suddenly available resources and update the attractive old stuff to have better quality.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moarbread</div><div class="date">2014-05-28, 04:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I play a shaman and I have to say the new sets for mail look absolutely NOTHING like what I feel a shaman might wear. They look like rogue leather gear. Punishing people who have crappy schedules that only have time for LFR with sub par looking gear is not the way to keep subscribers. I came back to WoW after having a stint with Final Fantasy. I love Final Fantasy, i played the hell out of it when i was younger but the artwork in the new MMO they have is too &quot;girly&quot; for me. Very feminine. I like WoW gear because it has a more macho feel to it. I'm very ticked off at the direction they are taking with this expansion already and I NEVER QQ about anything Blizzard does. This may in fact be my second post ever.</div></div><hr />

If you look at it, they are labelled correctly. If you look at the detail they have it right. It may not be the way you prefer but it is correct</div></div><hr />
