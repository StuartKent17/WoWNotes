<br />
Calico Cat - Calico Cat (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/65358/calico-cat)<br />
A new Cat Carrier probably drop from somewhere but I couldn't find it on PTRs yet, for the moment it is NOT available from Donni Anthania (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?npc=6367) in Elwynn Forest.<br />
<br />

<br />
Macabre Marionette - Macabre Marionette (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/66175/macabre-marionette)<br />
This is most likely a pet linked to the new Day of the Dead (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3456/dead-mans-party/) world event, this is pure speculation and there isn't any reliable information on this pet.<br />

<br />
Onyx Panther - Onyx Panther (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/67527/onyx-panther/)<br />
There isn't any information on this pet for the moment, but it's linked to the Onyx Panther (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/3896/onyx-panther/) achievement.<br />

<br />
That's what was suspected, but the 4th anniversary has already come and gone for them, so it's unlikely that it'll be related to that. June 7th was the date it would have been released if it were.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Maybe that is sth for all who complain about outdated graphics to consider: I recently upgraded my gefore on my pretty old system. And now, with all sliders to the max, the game looks damn amazing. Sure, it is no (insert latest flashy ego shooter), but still damn pretty and not outdated for me at all.<br />
<br />
As for new pets: Awesome news for us collectors. I &quot;only&quot; have 86 or so, but this will push me close to 100.</div></div><hr />

Well, they made that work with demos and pets, so why not with companions indeed? Some addons like Lifestock allow you to autosummon a random pet when you start moving (if none is out) - well..and some pets actually fly beside you :<br />

hmmm do you really think so? midsummer has not been revamped, the pirate-day is not worth mentioning yet, childrens day has been revamped and brought up to date AFTER it happened.... i don´t think they will add even more hollidays not even visible in the next x-pack... but on the other hand... it´s blizzard, so happy day of the dead everyone. although i would like to see the model redone as a pirate for the pirate day !! ^^</div></div><hr />

Good thing since I'm still/again Oracle, for that damn mount.<br />

<br />
Second that. Plus, since 3.0 they cause a GCD, so addons like Livestock can be annoying sometimes :/ Certain mounts also cause a GCD, while others don't... they definitely have to fix that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope king mosh in Un'goro drops one xD<br />
<br />
He isn't (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?npc=6584) a raptor, though. :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
hmmm do you really think so? midsummer has not been revamped, the pirate-day is not worth mentioning yet, childrens day has been revamped and brought up to date AFTER it happened.... i don´t think they will add even more hollidays not even visible in the next x-pack... <br />
<br />
Midsummer and Children's Day only got the achievements added, no actual changes to the events, though. Pirate's Day (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=3457) and Day of the Dead (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=3456) have one single achievement each tied to them on the PTR. The Pirate one hints at a new feature, while DotD is completely new. Both are just one-day events, with not much stuff.<br />
And then again, there's Pilgrim's Bounty (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=3656) (A (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=3478)) which seems to be a completely overhauled Harvest Festival (http://www.wowwiki.com/Harvest_Festival).</div></div><hr />

This is most likely a pet linked to the Hallow's End world event, this is pure speculation and there isn't any reliable information on this pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno if anyone MIGHT have mentioned this yet, BUT you might want to rethink that. There's a possibility that you might be wrong there, it could be the Day of the Dead holiday, seeing as it's very similar to decorations used in that celebration.<br />

firefly<br />
phoenix<br />
mr pinchy<br />

8 New raptor companion pets have been added to the game in this patch. You can find a lot of them on rare elite raptors throughout the world, the droprate is currently 100% for all of them. <br />
<br />
Darting Hatchling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/48112/darting-hatchling/) (SShot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/july/dartinghatchling.jpg)) drops from Dart (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=14232). (Rare Elite - Barrens)<br />
<br />
<br />
No whine post about the pets, but Dart is actually a rare elite in Dustwallow March ;).[/list]</div></div><hr />

<br />
He is. Devilsaurs are related to raptors in wow. He drops raptor skulls and feathers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He is a raptor in wow. Check out the loot table. Raptor skull, raptor feathers<br />
Pirate's Day (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=3457) and Day of the Dead (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=3456) have one single achievement each tied to them on the PTR. The Pirate one hints at a new feature, while DotD is completely new. Both are just one-day events, with not much stuff.<br />
And then again, there's Pilgrim's Bounty (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=3656) (A (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=3478)) which seems to be a completely overhauled Harvest Festival (http://www.wowwiki.com/Harvest_Festival).<br />
<br />
<br />
Day of the dead is a two day event in WoW. November 1st and november 2nd. Pilgrim's bounty is also not a re-work of the harvest festival but a new event. Pilgrims bounty is november 8th to the 14th. Harvest fest is september 27th to october 3rd.<br />
<br />
And it is pretty clear that the marionette is for day of the dead not just because of the name sharing of the real world holiday, but because of the icon the wow calendar uses for the holiday.<br />

This is a fantasy world, if you want, you can assume that tamed wolves/hyenas didn't lose their &quot;feral&quot; look to become something similar to the dogs of our world.<br />
Also note how e.g. real-world huskies still pretty much look like wolves.<br />
Nearly all &quot;dogs&quot; and &quot;hounds&quot; are used as combat companions anyway, with little intention to &quot;soften&quot; them.</div></div><hr />

Yes blizzard is lazy for not designing 20 sets of armor for tier 9.<br />
Because it is so simple designing the armor.<br />
Because reskinning and scaling down mobs to make these pets is a feat on the level of designing an armor set that would be unique not only to the faction but the class as well.</div></div><hr />

There aren't really any achievements for day of the dead yet. And it probaly wouldn't be added to the meta anyways. Blizzard rarely adds new things to the meta like that. Pilgrims bounty has yet to be added and that has a whole bunch</div></div><hr />

<br />
Children week will come to Dalaran before May 10th 210. It will come with the 3.2 patch. <br />

I will just assume that your other statements in your comments are just as uninformed.</div></div><hr />

Because it is so simple designing the armor.<br />
Because reskinning and scaling down mobs to make these pets is a feat on the level of designing an armor set that would be unique not only to the faction but the class as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So flawed by dear troll. They only designed one set per class. There are however different levels with different levels of stats. But the armor all looks the same. The most they'll do is recolor the different sets.<br />
<br />
AND AS YOU STATED:<br />

You forgot that &quot;casuals&quot; have &quot;ruined the game&quot; and you don't even need to &quot;faceroll&quot; instances, the loot will just be assigned to your mailbox when you enter an Instance. In that way....pets is all you need<br />

<br />
That was the same with the Kirin Tor Familiar and the 50 pets Skunk during the Beta, but I think that was simply a display bug, they actually were BoP. Might do the questline again to check whether the new pets are actually BoP.<br />
But still, expect this to be fixed for the release version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they did it with noblegarden... so in fact, they have added 100% of the &quot;new&quot; (post wotlk-release) world events to the &quot;what a long, strange trip it's been&quot; meta... ;)<br />
<br />
but you're right, nobody says they will do the same with day of the dead. however, i still find it odd to have two diferent world events for one same holiday...</div></div><hr />

Edit* another one dropped in 5 resets. This one was off a blue deviate guardian.</div></div><hr />
