StarCraft II - Ghosts of the Past Trailer<br />
Blizzard released a pretty cool trailer of Starcraft 2. <br />
<br />

Guild Perks (Guild Perks (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/221-Guild-Perks-Cataclysm))<br />
Guild Perks<br />
It won't be required or forced in my opinion. Larger guilds right now already enjoy a variety of advantages in getting groups together and such. So while the new system may encourage players to take part in guilds, it can be avoided if wanted. <br />
<br />
I have a pvp guild that is very small (about 10 members). Will it be theoretically possible to earn all the guild perks, even if we dont raid at all?<br />
I can't say anything is final right now, but the idea (last I heard) is that there would be multiple ways to level the guild - it just may take longer for a smaller one. As expected though, we hope to do some testing on this once things are ready in the beta to get a better feel for what works and what doesn't. <br />
<br />
Small guilds disadvantaged by guild perks?<br />
In my experience the people who like to focus on smaller guilds don't really care what the other larger guilds are doing as they are happily doing their own thing. It also sounds like you don't fully understand the guild system and we'll have more details to help you out when we are farther along in the beta. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227192772/are-we-forced-to-join-a-guild-upcoming-cata/))<br />
<br />
&quot;Balancing&quot; Guild Perks<br />
I'm sure we'll be playing around with it a fair amount in the beta. We don't want it to be a mega penalty to lose the rep to where players stay in a guild they don't like - but at the same time a lot of these changes are meant to encourage guilds as a whole so we don't want it to be extremely trivial to gain the reputation to where players give no thought to guild hopping (like now). We know this may shake things up for some players but we feel it will be a better result for the game as a whole to have a stronger setup for guilds. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227192772/are-we-forced-to-join-a-guild-upcoming-cata/))<br />
<br />
Impact of Guild Perks on the game<br />
We care about all of our players. We consider many different factors before implementing new systems especially when they may affect a lot of our players. That said, we do have to design and implement what we feel is best for the game. As a random example off the top of my head, players tend to dislike nerfs, but if one class is ahead of others we will nerf that one class and not buff 9 others.<br />
<br />
A lot of players are also afraid of change. Before they even test things out or while it's in an early stage, they will declare the world has imploded. (See talent tree changes.) None of this means we don't care about our players. We understand that things will get shaken up, this won't be the first time gets shaken up and it won't be last, but we still need to design things the way we feel they are best for the game. Players can either choose to try it out or avoid it in favor of their own style.<br />
<br />
There may be an impact on the economy, there may be an impact on recruiting, there may be an impact on guild sizes - but the end result is likely to be very positive on the game. We aren't designing it to cripple solo players and I haven't seen anybody provide a valid example of this so far. We have made a lot of changes recently to help support both smaller and larger guilds and want players to feel special for being part of a cool guild in this multiplayer game. We are looking forward to testing this feature with the thousands and thousands of players who are (and will be) in the beta and make it the best it possibly can be for as many of our players as possible.

Classes<br />
Paladins and Warriors are too similar<br />
They are going to end up looking more different from each other than they do on Live today. They have gotten too similar. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227742779/paladin-and-warriors-looking-similar/))<br />
<br />
AE Tanking<br />
Neither Thunder Clap (even with the new talents) nor Consecrate will do the entire job for you, even on AE pulls. You'll need to use other attacks to maintain threat. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227742779/paladin-and-warriors-looking-similar/))<br />

Sleep (This one is actually my fault. ^^)<br />
Sleep is not a new class ability. I assume it refers to a creature ability. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683056/is-sleep-real-or-a-datamined-npc-ability/))<br />

(Retribution paladins, please read that post about missing changes in yesterday's post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/740644-Retribution-Discussion-Build-12539?p=8410746&amp;viewfull=1#post8410746))<br />
<br />
Depth of Gameplay<br />
You are using &quot;depth&quot; to mean &quot;I have a large toolbox&quot; or &quot;an answer to everything.&quot; We use &quot;depth&quot; to mean there is more going on than just pop your cooldowns and kill someone. Good paladins will be able to manage those new mechanics and will do competitive damage as a result. Bad paladins will do lower damage. You will find other players who get killed by you (or get beaten by you in PvE) will complain more when they think they were &quot;outplayed&quot; because you pushed a button and beat them. They will complain less when they think you had to juggle a lot of balls in the air well to be able to achieve that damage.<br />
<br />
Note that I did not say they won't complain at all. In PvP it's always because the other guy was overpowered. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227722792/afraid-of-ret-s-design-direction/))<br />
<br />
Ardent Defender<br />
Ardent Defender - Activate to reduce damage taken by 20% for 10 sec. While active, attacks which would otherwise kill you cause you to be healed for 15% of your maximum health. 3 minute cooldown. Off the GCD. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227683121/thoughts-on-the-current-prot-pally-tree/))<br />
<br />
Seal of Wisdom Gone<br />
Seal of Insight is the new healer-oriented Seal. It combines the effects of Light and Wisdom.<br />
<br />
Judgement of Wisdom's effect (casters using wands on a target to regen mana) is what we cut. The communication error is probably mine. The new spell, just called Judgement, combines the Justice (limits movement speed) and Light (chance of a melee heal) effects. <br />
<br />
[...] Seal of Insight: Fills the Paladin with divine power, giving each single-target melee attack a chance to heal the Paladin and restore 4% of the paladin's maximum mana. Only one Seal can be active on the Paladin at any one time. Unleashing this Seal's energy will deal Holy damage to an enemy.<br />
<br />
Judgement: Unleashes the energy of a Seal to judge an enemy for Holy damage. Judged targets move slower and cannot flee. Attacking a judged target has a chance of healing the attacker.<br />
<br />
&quot;Move slower&quot; is a cap on run speed, as it is today.<br />
<br />
Judgement is considered a melee attack for purposes of restoring mana via Seal of Insight.<br />
<br />
We're iterating on all of this quickly though, so things might have changed by the next beta build. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227742991/r-i-p-seal-of-wisdom/))<br />
<br />
Heart of the Crusader / Judgement of the Wise / Mana Regen<br />
As clarification, Heart of the Crusader is cut. Judgements of the Wise is also cut as a talent. Instead, Ret and Prot generate mana on Judgement passively. Ret then has a 1 point talent to add Replenishment to that effect. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227282693/rebuke-retribution-paladin-talent/))<br />
<br />
And do you mean that Ret and prot regain mana in way a similar to Judgements of the Wise (as in it restores mana to us upon cast)? or do you mean it is similar to Judgement of Wisdom (restores mana every time we hit the judged target)? <br />
Judgements of the Wise. Incidentally, the Judgement of Wisdom mechanic no longer exists.<br />
<br />
Both Ret and Prot will still have access to Divine Plea if needed for emergency mana, though we don't anticipate they will need to use it on cooldown. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227282693/rebuke-retribution-paladin-talent/))<br />
<br />
Protection Paladins in Build 12539<br />
There are no bonus Stamina talents. Prot paladins get +10% Stamina at level 10 for choosing Prot spec. We also cut the Spiritual Attunement mechanic and the &quot;Improved Divine Plea&quot; mechanic. Instead, Prot gets Judgement of the Wise (sans the raid Replenishment effect) as a passive, just like Ret. In essence, the melee paladins should rarely run out of mana, and if they do, they always have Divine Plea for emergencies.<br />
<br />
Mana will still matter to them in the sense that if a Ret or Prot tries to be a healer or spam Consecrate, they'll blow through their bar more quickly than it will refill. But if they are using their normal attacks, mana should stay in a steady state.<br />
<br />
(Note that Prot can still use Consecrate without spamming it by taking the long duration talent.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227192760/prot-paladins-in-beta-build-12539/))<br />

Upcoming Warlock Changes<br />
Here are a few upcoming changes you'll see in the next beta build:<br />
<br />
-- Improved Drain Soul and Dark Pact have been cut / redesigned.<br />
-- Aftermath is a 100% chance to proc with 2 points. That is just a tooltip error.<br />
-- Soul Fire&#8217;s base cast time is reduced to 4 sec, and Emberstorm takes it down to 3 sec.<br />
-- Demonic Aegis back to 15/30%.<br />
-- Drain Life will do more competitive damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227282699/gt-gt-warlock-talent-feedback-thread-2-lt-lt/))<br />

New Impending Victory<br />
The intent isn't that Victory Rush becomes some kind of awesome but unreliable defensive cooldown with this talent. It's more that if you spend the talent points, you can get an &quot;Execute range&quot; attack that isn't Execute and might heal you a little. I wouldn't consider it anywhere on par with say Toughness or Shield Mastery. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227742765/impending-victory-huh/))<br />

Damn thats expensive. I got lucky by typing &quot;Starcraft 2 Collectors edition&quot; to google and searched on my language. All the gaming sites were sold out and cost around 100€ but then i found the CE version from regular electric store website for 67€ and the normal version for 44€. And their stock was still full.

I don't know HOW many times (ok, almost every raid at least once) that thing saved my life. The other tankclassskills like the dk -35% dmg thing are nothing against it, because you CAN'T die - one hit is killing you &gt; revive &gt; enough hp and the next heals kicking in. It's just too much of a failsave.<br />

<br />
<br />
So I really hope I either just massively misinterpreted the trailer or am completely losing my mind, but if they're trying to eventually sneak in some kind of redemption story for kerrigan I am going to be quite disappointed. I'm hoping I just failed to keep up with the flashback/current story back and forth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Imo, the trailer doesn't make it seem like Kerrigan get's a redemption story. It seems more like she's come to finish the job like Raynor said, aka kill everyone.</div></div><hr />

That is called trailer music (also known as epic music) its made for movies and game trailers. Sometimes same piece of music appears on different projects, it happens.<br />
<br />
Some groups that make this kind of music if you are interested: Two Steps from Hell, Immediate Music, X-ray Dog, City of the Fallen and others.<br />
<br />
On topic, the cinematic is epic as always but its expected when it comes from Blizzard and their standards!</div></div><hr />

Maybe curse will actually make MMOchampion into MMOchampion and not just WOWchampion? hehe<br />

I'm starting to believe that maybe they acquired the site for the actual name and to branch off into multiple sections covering all the other games out there otherwise why spend so much money on a site solely based on a game that is at best in it's mid life.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hambo</div><div class="date">2010-07-22, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is called trailer music (also known as epic music) its made for movies and game trailers. Sometimes same piece of music appears on different projects, it happens.<br />
<br />
Some groups that make this kind of music if you are interested: Two Steps from Hell, Immediate Music, X-ray Dog, City of the Fallen and others.<br />
<br />
On topic, the cinematic is epic as always but its expected when it comes from Blizzard and their standards!<br />
<br />
I'm aware of that - I actually used some tracks of Two Steps from Hell for my Guilds Bosskill-Vids ^^<br />
Anyway, I'm a bit surprised still. Blizzard always managed to create own characteristic tracks, so licensing a track, that probably already had been used a few times (even for such popular trailers like that Avatar one), just doesn't fit very much to Blizzard imho. Maybe they don't want the Trailer to be taken too seriously, but then again it's too well made for that - I dunno. As I said: just wondering =)</div></div><hr />

Wait - what? So you're dissapointed in Blizzard for harms done through WoW, but continues spewing money into their bad titles (WoW XPacks) instead of the good ones (SC2, DIII)?<br />
<br />
My guild just managed to go 11/12 normal mode ICC25 with 20 people this week. Since we can normally only field about 20 people at this point in the expansion, I think the 30% buff definitely helps there. Then again we went 2/4 in RS with 20 people.<br />

I wonder how many people will buy SC2:CE for the rare WoW pet with no intent to play the game, considering MMORPGs and RTS are like apples and oranges.<br />
<br />
I think most of the original people that went WoW gaga did so because they played the Warcraft Series (which was RTS). I don't know if anyone is insane enough to pay $99 for an ingame pet. Considering its probably a code you might as well go to eBay and buy it for $50 if you are.<br />

<br />
No - for real - this was more a movietrailer then one for &quot;Just a game&quot; ... and I just wet my pants :3<br />
<br />
Probably after the third part of the saga comes out and we have already spent $150-$300 for the game.<br />

Just wait till 4.1 when enough people have bitched about in in PvP that Blizzard decides to put it on forbearance.<br />

Yes because I can totally see how no one on this site is interested in a new game coming from Blizzard.<br />

Upcoming Warlock Changes<br />
Here are a few upcoming changes you'll see in the next beta build:<br />
<br />
-- Improved Drain Soul and Dark Pact have been cut / redesigned.<br />
-- Aftermath is a 100% chance to proc with 2 points. That is just a tooltip error.<br />
-- Soul Fire&#8217;s base cast time is reduced to 4 sec, and Emberstorm takes it down to 3 sec.<br />
-- Demonic Aegis back to 15/30%.<br />
-- Drain Life will do more competitive damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26227282699/gt-gt-warlock-talent-feedback-thread-2-lt-lt/))<br />

<br />
I'm starting to believe that maybe they acquired the site for the actual name and to branch off into multiple sections covering all the other games out there otherwise why spend so much money on a site solely based on a game that is at best in it's mid life.<br />
<br />
WoW is still MMO-Champion. Nothing has ever come close to it. WoW is not in its &quot;mid life&quot;. If UO can exist for 12+ years then WoW isn't going anywhere anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

Will there be a Glyph of Seal of Insight that increases healing done by 5% and reduces mana cost of heals by 5%? I understand now that Holy Wrath is supposed to be the Tankadin's AE snap aggro that we've been asking for for a while, as a trigger-happy dps could easily pull a new add by accident if the first tick of consecration missed (I don't understand why they never fixed it so it couldn't miss).<br />
<br />
One thing I am worried about is the new mana replenishment mechanic for Tanks. I have a feeling it'll be a bit screwy. Something along the lines of not restoring enough mana (to the point where you need to pop Divine Plea every cd), and when they buff it they think it restores too much, so they nerf it back down and it doesn't restore enough again, etc. I hope they get the balance right on this one, a mana-starved paladin is no better than a rage-starved warrior.</div></div><hr />

It can be followed by many things like RPG, RTS etc.Note the &quot;Massively&quot; though, which refers mostly to how many people can play the game with each other at once.

Technically MMO does stand for Massively Multiplayer Online. However, by default it refers to the RPG variety. If you want to refer to any other type of Massively Multiplayer Online game you need to include the rest of the letters, but MMO is short for MMORPG.</div></div><hr />

This trailer is really going to disappoint people though. It pumps you up and then once you start playing the game...you lose that adrenaline because of how boring RTS games are. <br />
<br />
Mass Effect 2 did it right...epic trailer followed by epic gameplay. What will this game do? Epic trailer followed by epic...gathering resources to build lowest tier building? LOLOLOL. <br />

Yeah, damn a game for actually requiring you to interface with it. I mean, how could SC2 do something so stupid as requiring people to click a mouse to play it? Hasn't Blizzard learned from every other game ever for the PC? You can't ever make people use a mouse!<br />
<br />
... Really, what do you want? All Quicktime events all the time?</div></div><hr />

I don't even know where to start, the amount of irony, incompetence, hypocrisy, and just plain stupidity in this post actually surprised me.<br />
<br />
You sound like one of the most arrogant and mediocre douchebags I've ever seen on the internet, and I guarantee you that the majority of good SC2 players who play WoW are better than the majority of good WoW players who don't play SC2.<br />
RTS games are not boring, you're probably just terrible at them and hate losing so you dismiss the game as bad and go back to a more casual one, telling yourself all along the way that it's the game that's bad and it's impossible that you're not the best gamer ever.<br />
You probably got into the SC2 beta, got rushed a few times, and blamed it on the game. HF with your life governed by cognitive biases.</div></div><hr />

in trailer video at 1:58, shows Raynor's crew. take note of the beer cans strapped to the far left guy's chest along with pens. Also the woman on the far right has the same face as WoW human female.</div></div><hr />
