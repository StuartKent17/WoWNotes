Patch 5.4 - Kor'kron Supplies<br />
One nice addition in Patch 5.4 that not many people have noticed is the Kor'kron Supply crates (http://www.wowdb.com/objects/223521-korkron-supplies) scattered around the Dark Shaman area of the Siege of Orgrimmar. These boxes contain flasks and potions that aren't specific to your class or spec and are a nice way to supplement your guild's (or your own!) consumable supply. <br />

DPS/HPS logs should have never been added to the game. The cost is not justified by the benefit.<br />
It's nice to be able to evaluate your performance to fine tune gear or rotation. Agree the competitive aspect is out of control. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374970588487360512))<br />
<br />
This AM I saw: our DPS is too low, nobody wants us, we need an overhaul from pretty much every class. Those all can't be true. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374986824050962432))<br />
I think it's obv from buffs/nerfs through the exp cycle that it's obvious overhauls needed. Scaling is out of control<br />
Players obsess about scaling too much. OTOH even with perfect scaling, players would be unhappy if we didn't constantly tune balance (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375298008297922560))<br />
Put another way, even if all specs scaled identically with gear, encounter mechanics have a far greater impact on performance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375298283435868160))<br />
<br />
I disagree. I think a support class fun as long as people knew up front that's what they were rolling.<br />
That's possible. Back in the MC days I suspect many players made their class decisions without that information. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374968597551910912))<br />
In fact, I suspect back in the MC days, many players didn't even consider the endgame until they got there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374968686848643072))<br />
I will agree it was bullshit to find out that your feral was garbage. Less impressed with shaman/pally arguments tho.<br />
My original MC raid had at least 4 paladins that rolled to be melee DPS and were told they had to heal and buff in raids. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374978517634514944))<br />
<br />
Actually it's because the class has been switched upside down since launch<br />
Claiming we don't have a direction or vision for a class is generally a good way not to get us to read something. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374972660163162113))<br />
It's not that we are afraid of criticism; far from it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374972833446645760))<br />
We were pretty clear that Fistweaving was always a secondary mechanic, much like Atonement healing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374978074942529536))<br />
We never wanted to hear monks (or any healer) say &quot;I cannot stand with the other healers. I MUST be in melee.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374978158358831104))<br />
<br />
When people ask me what spec to play, I often tell them &quot;whatever you enjoy or can do the best at&quot; is this good advice?<br />
Yes. Most players worry far too much about theoretical max DPS. The success of *your* group is rarely dependent on it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373973081523367936))<br />
<br />
what u think of talent trees? do u really think ur playerbase wants to constantly switch talents every 5 seconds?<br />
We think they want to change talents once in awhile, versus the old model of never looking at the talent screen again. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374951663531855872))<br />
<br />
e.g. specialize on the talent level, not the class level, by providing talents that significantly favour single or AE healing?<br />
I think you would have to do something like: must have a shield healer and an AE healer, with 2-3 class choices each. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373969275641282560))<br />
The problem with talents, though we still do it sometimes, is AE usually wins in MoP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373969468826722304))<br />
It's really hard to get that &quot;glad we have a druid&quot; feel you're looking for without very strong / mandatory unique utility. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373969759382945792))<br />
A different design is that instead of tank, healer, DPS (ABC) you have ABCDE and a 10 needs two of each. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373970159645388800))<br />
The ABCDE model lets each class / spec feel powerful and unique but hurts the raid that likes to raid with e.g. 3 hunters. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373970314947870720))<br />
<br />
why all caster class haste make more DoT's Ticks, but meele and ranged this isn't happen??<br />
The intent is haste generally provides more resources for melee and hunters to deliver on the &quot;haste lets you do more&quot; concept. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/378962938985316354))<br />

Example A: Deterrence doesn't work how it is supposed to work and is half as strong as it is supposed to be. no fix<br />
Deterrence in 5.4 is working as intended. The charge system has proven challenging to explain / understand. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380061998525865984))<br />

the question about female Demon Form is constantly dodged by Blues. Is this so hard to implement? Would make locks happy.<br />
Not that hard to implement, but it does take real artist time if it's more than just a bow on a Voidwalker. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380065816164593664))<br />
but what if my voidwalker wants to wear a bow, even voidwalkers want to feel pretty.<br />
I'm not judging. Each voidwalker can dress how he or she wants. I won't burden them with traditional gender norms. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/380088065336688640))<br />

Character / Items<br />
Can we remove Personal Loot from Flex, Getting the same item 4 weeks in a row in LFR is terrible design<br />
Sharding the same item 4 weeks in a row in heroic isn't all that fun either. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376881551167852544))<br />
so why are there capes dropping in heroic soo?<br />
Maybe one of your raiders decided to reroll and doesn't have an orange cloak? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/377205353064046592))<br />
<br />
Hey Greg, would you be so kind and explain the drop-system of the new heirloom weapons?<br />
The first one you get will be for your loot spec. After that it's random. All are personal loot. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376877561990488064))<br />
Is it the 1st one on each difficulty mode (F/N/H), or only the 1st one on the first difficulty mode you clear?<br />
The intent is per difficulty. We don't want someone e.g. avoiding N Garrosh for fear of wasting their chance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376888397295411201))<br />

Flex Raiding<br />
First 2 wings of Flex down and must say rivals BT for epic so far. Boss fights are mad fun and seem to reflect player feedback<br />
Oustanding. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/381499429166936065))<br />
<br />
How many teeth are missing from the average Flex audience member? Are they shirtless? Have they been on &quot;COPS&quot;?<br />
Our hope is that they are pretty normal players who put a premium on playing with friends and family over progression. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376887849628344321))<br />
A traditional raiding guild might boot a nice player with low DPS. The intended flex audience would never dream of it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/376888081313304577))<br />
<br />
i will not use on principle its an attempt to kill lfr.<br />
It is not an attempt to kill LFR. It's an attempt to provide a more casual alternative to N for social groups who don't enjoy LFR. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/373885346028605440))<br />
Flex just is not needed. There's already that... it's called 10-man. If guild can't form then they have bigger issues.<br />
We disagree. 10-player ToT is harder than 10-player ICC. The players who enjoyed the ICC level of difficulty are shut out. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/374988919940464640))<br />
What was the rationale for the step-up in difficulty since Wrath? Did 10-man ICC feel too easy to devs?<br />
A series of steps. 1) Didn't want 10s to feel like 2nd class citizens, so we gave them the same ilevel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375301972712112128))<br />
2) Didn't want same ilevel for easier difficulty, so we brought 10s up to the 25 level (overall - there is variety per boss). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375302077653606400))<br />
You can argue that those were both missteps, but that's how we arrived where we are today. Flex is trying to recapture ICC 10. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/375302198206271488))<br />

It is (WAS) kinda OP already still. You get it at the start of the fight for demo, and you can, if lucky keep the 100% crit doom run on the maintarget the entire fight. It is however really really rare you can, deppending on the fight obviously. And this nerf in my eyes well.. <br />
.. You could however be happy if you get Agony as affli with the trinket, for multi-target fights where amazing. Dont really know if it's still worth useing. But for protectors you'll get a hell of a burst. Like I said, 97% out of 100% it still procs at the start, and I bet it will still proc at the start of a fight.</div></div><hr />

Claiming we don't have a direction or vision for a class is generally a good way not to get us to read something. (Source)<br />
It's not that we are afraid of criticism; far from it.*<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing is: It's true. Doesn't count for all classes and specs...but for people that chose a shadow back in vanilla it's definitely like that. Back in vanilla we have been solo-pvp-killers. Since then we have never again been on a halfway decent level in solo-anything. Therefor we have been pve-mana-batteries, pve-aoe-freaks and &quot;something that is standing in between classes, can do everything but nothing right&quot;. Unfortunately unlike druide etc. we only got healing to chose from if the damage spec gets the boot...and healing is not for everyone.<br />
I would definitely not choose my shadow again, but I got it since vanilla.<br />
<br />
Seeing that we now got another nerf that is definitely uncalled for in pvp or solo content(where we had at least a halfway decent spot during the last couple month in LARGER teams)...well...gives me the feeling that the game gets balanced around Paragon and Method again(and I have no idea if they use a high number of shadows...I just don't care for them).</div></div><hr />

Clearly you didn't see the constant changes and nerfs we have received in 1 spec or another requiring us to constantly change specs or the major MAJOR nerf to combustion this tier and our crit scaling due to them putting too much crit gear in SoO.<br />

<br />
I play in 10 man, our other tank is &quot;always MT&quot; type of person and so he always tanks during bloodlust, choose targets for more vengeance etc. If you solo tank, you can have absurd amounts of vengeance and therefore dmg. That's maybe why that other tank tops dmg. While playing as offtank you have not much opportunities. Now in SoO it was fine because I haven't felt like most useless person in raid and today I read nerf which got me disappointed. But pretty please please go play class to comment on it instead arriving with story about &quot;other tank in my realm&quot; because that's when you can be quite sure to know what you are talking about. I am not commenting mage or lock dps because &quot;I've heard from other guilds on server that they are OP&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fury needs to move on almost all fights in SoO, warlocks can stand still 95% of the time on 80% of the fights, yes this is real life, when you as a warlock will have to run from Arctic to Antarctic without being able to DPS like melee has to, to avoid a boss dynamic we can talk (Galakras, just to give you an example, but almost every boss pretty much requires tons of movement from melee where dps is lost, unlike ranged classes).</div></div><hr />

Check pretty much any competent Rogue in SoO and youll see them firmly ahead of any other melee by quite a chunk. Hell even beating the ranged.<br />

That's wrong, might be ahead of other melee but certainly not by 'quite a chunk' you also need to remember, A LOT of fights in siege are cleave heavy or requires a lot of targets switching, both making assassination shit, so no, a nerf is not justified, heck if we were really doing so well it wouldn't be a minor nerf.</div></div><hr />
