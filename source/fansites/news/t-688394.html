Professor Putricide's Tear Gas will no longer remove player auras.<br />
The Growing Ooze Puddles in the Professor Putricide encounter will no longer continue to grow while players are stunned.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heroic instances nerfs in the next patch<br />
Apparently, the Oculus was only the first heroic instance to be nerfed and a lot of them are on the list for the next patch (or even later in the case of CoS). You might not agree with all these changes but some of them will probably make a few bosses less annoying ... <br />
<br />
Ahn'kahet, the Old Kingdom<br />
With that said, we plan on making some changes to The Old Kingdom in the next minor patch. For instance, Elder Nadox will only get one Ahn'Kahar Guardian and Jadoga Shadowseeker will only use her Ascend ability once during their respective encounters. In addition, a couple of the stagnant groups of bad dudes between the Befouled Terrace and The Desecrated Altar will be removed, while some of the roaming groups will have their pathing altered. These changes are not to make this instance easier, but rather to make it a slightly quicker run and more in line with some of the other Wrath dungeons.<br />
<br />
Nexus<br />
I think you mean Anomalus. Yes, he will use his Create Rift ability less often. [...] we're continuing to learn that time and difficulty aren't synonymous measurements. For instance, Anomalus could use his Create Rift ability 20 times before you could kill him if we wanted to make it so. This would increase the encounter's difficulty by a negligible amount, the hardest part of which would be staying awake. <br />
<br />
The Culling of Stratholme<br />
We plan to do something to allow players a quicker start to this dungeon, however, the fix to the scripting is more complicated than the changes we're making to some of the other dungeons and likely will not be ready for the next minor patch. <br />
<br />
<br />

Adjustments to Heroic dungeons in the next patch<br />
As I originally said, many of the adjustments we're making to Wrath of the Lich King dungeons in the next minor patch is not to make them easier, but to remove some of the fluff that's already trivial for a large majority of those using the Dungeon Finder. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22418636061-random-lfg--old-kingdom-80-of-the-time.html))<br />
<br />
Battered Hilt droprate<br />
Just jumping in here to let you know we aren't ignoring this topic but simply have no current plans to make any changes to this item. We know that this can be frustrating under certain circumstances but we don't feel that this frustration will really be avoided unless we give out the item on a consistent basis which we don't want to do.<br />
<br />
Having the item as BoE allows people who really want the item to get it via a trade or the auction house which I know several players have been able to do. Yes, this can cost a lot of gold but through some consistent focus it is possible to save up the money for this and the prices have continued to go down as the weeks have gone by which only helps. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22418975992-battered-hilt-drop-rate-really.html))<br />
<br />
No sanctuary city in Cataclysm<br />
We don't have plans for a sanctuary city in the likes of Shattrath or Dalaran for Cataclysm. For the most part players will be working out of their current faction capitals to keep in the spirit of bringing life back to the old world Azeroth. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22418946194-separate-cities-in-cata.html))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Dungeons<br />
We've learned a lot from our Wrath of the Lich King dungeons. I think you can expect us to approach Cataclysm dungeons with some new ideas, especially taking into consideration the Dungeon Finder. This system has drastically changed the way dungeons are run and we want to make sure future dungeons are designed with this in consideration. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22418636061-random-lfg--old-kingdom-80-of-the-time.html))<br />
<br />
Festergut/Plagueworks difficulty<br />
Festergut is a pretty tough pile of flesh and stiches. So far we are pretty happy with the balancing in the Plagueworks and like how the progression is going. Yes, he is hard but that is pretty intentional and we will make changes if we feel they are necessary.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that we mentioned awhile back (link for reference: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=21038229051&amp;sid=1 ) that eventually there will be a buff for all players in the dungeon which will not directly be a nerf but will make the encounters easier to get past for those who are struggling. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/22418945972-my-festergut-experience-25.html))<br />
<br />
Arena Titles and 2v2 teams<br />
- Although you cannot obtain the Gladiator title from 2v2, can you still obtain Duelist and below? <br />
No, these titles will not be available from 2v2 ratings alone. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/11/22418704838-blue--2v2-titles-for-duelist-and-lower.html))<br />

Conflagrate changes<br />
Hopefully this post doesn't get too buried in this thread since it's grown quite a bit since I last posted. Another change we'd like to make for Destruction warlocks concerns Conflagrate. We're looking into doubling the damage-over-time effect to 40% of Conflagrate's total damage, up from 20%.<br />
<br />
As usual, I must warn you that this change is in testing and subject to revision or removal before the next patch goes live. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22418944362-lock-buffs-inc.html))<br />

Shield Slam changes<br />
The diminishing returns on shield slam damage now starts to kick in when shield block value is more than 1960 (at level 80). It maxes at behaving as if your shield block value is 2072 when your block value is actually 3160 (again, at level 80). Remember this includes the scaling from both shield block value on gear AND shield block value from Strength.

If you have a good tank, those &quot;annoying&quot; patrols in Old Kingdom are doable.<br />

You mostly need a good geared tank and healer.<br />
However, I dunno why, and I'm not complaining, but I seem to always get a good geared tank that rarely requires effort to keep up. It's mostly the dps that fails and stands in fires and voidzones etc.</div></div><hr />

I'm confused... are you upset that content that's been obsolete for four tiers of content and almost an entire year is being made less annoying? I think it's a godsend for gearing alts.<br />

I'm especially glad that gearing alts is being made easier, since my main's a prot warrior.<br />

Well, I gotta admit that some overgeared players really can be assholes towards freshly dinged 80s who just don't got the DPS, HPS or TPS overgeared players would accept nowadays. <br />
<br />
Though, I can't say any Northrend dungeons are hard. They all are pretty easy, though some are just annoying (OK one of them, I just don't like the dungeon without any specific reason I can mention).<br />

It matches my day perfectly before work and or school. Wake up, turn on the pc and the game, start the LFD system (as dps ofc).

Again I love it! :D<br />
<br />
No really, I don't see a big problem in them changing the old 5 man heroics, this far into the game. It really doesn't matter does it? It's easier triumph for what ever offspec you have, and alts. Overall it's a nice change, coz OK really is just has too damn much trash and isn't hard, but just annoying...<br />

<br />
Its such a small amount of time.... time that is really the most stimulating parts of the dungeon. Its Blizzard admitting that most people are just grinding the heroics, not enjoying them, and while that's technically true, its not exactly a design philosophy I'd like Blizzard to adapt.... err well im probably exaggerating there... <br />

If you have a good tank, those &quot;annoying&quot; patrols in Old Kingdom are doable.<br />
Had groups where we sometimes pulled 2 groups by accident and lived through. It's not hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
It has less to do with a good tank and more to do with people doing their part in interrupting the Spell-Flingers.<br />
The vast majority of the times I've wiped in OK is because A) People are completely unaware of their surroundings and pull an additional group with another Spell-Flinger in it, and B) After I've used up my Bash and Feral Charge interrupting their 40k spell, the 3 DPS are, as usual, oblivious and simply ignore the spell being cast. The only reason it doesn't 1-shot me is because I have 43k unbuffed, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't 1-shot me when there are 2 of them and they both cast their spell one after another unhindered. There is nothing a tank or healer can do about that if they've already done all they can to make up for idiotic DPS.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, stop ignoring spells you should interrupt because you're afraid your meter score will go down. Damage means nothing if you keep letting me die.</div></div><hr />

Hell no. The only thing that is really good about dalaran is the fact that you have PORTALZ (zomg), nothing more.<br />

It would take less than 30 secs to kill them in current raids gear, but the encounters last too long due to the mechanics...<br />
Putting submerges/dissipates on a timer instead of health percentage would fix that.<br />

I think what they ment with that was that you can't skip any bosses like you do now when rushing to the last one. Altought i really hope that they arent going to make 'em as easy as in WoTLK. Maybe as fast, but not that easy : P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play this game for around 5 years now, and I can remember when I started that I was always looking up to people that had done dungeons/raids like mc/bwl etc. etc. In those days you were looked up to if you run in full T3.. In those days you went for fun to a aly/horde city and just stand there and see all the low levels try to beat you.. Ooh the days.. When TBC came out there was a run again to get the beautiful T4/T5/T6 and also in that time everybody stared at you and investigate you on you gear, and know that you got talent/skills.. still got my T6 in the bank because I really think you had earned it/worked hard for it…<br />
<br />
But since Wotlk came out Bliz changed his strategy, and at first I was ok.. maybe it is a good idea to let people see end-game, because it is unfair that only the few among us saw BT etc.. But reading up more and more lately and see pugs going to ICC hardmode (10 man etc.) i think that blizz lost his way..

<br />
Just my opinion on this.. but nerfing things also nerfs the players level/skill.. If a player doesn’t have the skill to do these kind of dungeons maybe the game is not the place for them, and also you don’t need to have the dungeon finder filter out low levels (see posts on mmo here also). <br />

There are a few pats that get pretty close to another group, for instance, if you take the right route to the first boss, the patrol at the bottom of the stairs. Then the patrol that can cut your group off if you didn't clear the left path. The two groups of elemental patrols before the last boss.

Blizzard hasn't made any of the content itself easier, encounters have gotten more difficult, its just that the players have all gotten better.<br />
<br />
I'm not complaining about gearing up taking a hell of a lot shorter either. I'll sacrifice the vain stupidity of people going AFK in the middle of cities just so others can inspect them for the countless very skilled players I've raided with who probably wouldn't have even seen that content with the amount of playtime they have. Blizzard is a business ladies and gentlemen, and if you only let a select number of players see end-game content those players are going to eventually quit. That's a lot of $15/months Blizzard wont be seeing anymore.<br />
<br />
Everyone who's hit 80, done the requisite badge farming and made it past all the encounters in ICC (which are no walk in the park) should fight the Lich King. That's a hell of a lot better for the game than having to be in an uber-leet guild and put in 30 hours a week to see the absolutely amazing content of the past month or so.</div></div><hr />

We've learned a lot from our Wrath of the Lich King dungeons. I think you can expect us to approach Cataclysm dungeons with some new ideas, especially taking into consideration the Dungeon Finder. This system has drastically changed the way dungeons are run and we want to make sure future dungeons are designed with this in consideration.<br />
<br />
<br />
So basically everything has to be quick and easy, because otherwise people will just leave when a specific dungeon comes up (like Oculus). As much as I like the new random LFG tool, not all new dungeons should be designed with it in mind. There's a great danger here of killing even more diversity from the game. Yes there should be fast dungeons that you can chain run, but there should also be dungeons with creative mechanics (e.g., Oculus) and epic dungeons that take hour+ to finish (e.g., BRD).</div></div><hr />

Someone brought the &quot;back in the day shit was harder&quot; argument again. That argument gets beaten by the &quot;you have hardmodes&quot; and &quot;there is no right lv difficulty&quot; arguments. Those 5 man nerfs are more of a &quot;this instance will be less annoying&quot; fix. Also players dont get their skills from 5 mans, they get their skills from friends and the internet (if they research their class). Also vanilla wasn't hard it just had more people that didnt know what to do, right now we have lots of strats and guides on how to play our class well.</div></div><hr />

I'm sort of annoyed at the whole Battered Hilt thing. I thought Blizzard had moved on from the days of highly desirable items having sub-1% drop chances. All they look at is the statistics. They don't care if some guy who doesn't even need it gets it on the first drop and then promptly sells it for free money, and they don't care if someone who runs every dungeon every day for months never sees it drop, as long as the game is giving out the correct number of items what it takes to get them is meaningless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1h+ dungeons no, please. That's for raids.<br />
<br />
But getting 10 min easly lolololaoe runs at cataclysm is a bad thing... players will get bored really fast. Yes, when everything is lolololol people also get bored... and even faster. Not to mention starting a new xpac alread with the mentality &quot;queue, grab 180 emblems, buy all gear in a day, pug raid... uahh... I guess it was enough for me last year, gonna do something diferent somewhere...&quot;.<br />
<br />
Guess that's why they will gate the Path of the Titans...<br />
<br />
Just hope they at least change how the Dungeon Finder works where you need to 1st go to the dungeon the normal away, beat it and then earn the ability to teleport to there after that (after all, 2nd, 3rd, 4th... time is farming, not questing/lore anymore). Keeps the imersion of the game + players learn where to go when releasing and running back.<br />
<br />
I had the hope that they would make the normal and heroic settings of 5mans to be more in line with normal/heroic from raids. But guess it won't change. 5man heroics doesn't mean hardmodes, just emblem farm unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Btw, people asking &quot;what about HoS?&quot;. Look back at each change/nerf, they avoid changing things that impacts directly in the Glory of the Hero achievements. So, no, they will probably never change Brann's event (since you can even do that and the last boss only for your emblems) or Anubarak's submerge (speed kill) or the insanity from OK's last boss (another speed kill).<br />
<br />
When they actually change something that impact on a achievement (like Jedoga's changes) it's because there's nothing more left there, everyone can outgear her buffed damage from volunteers... the Elder could also be done kiting him away since the launch, so... it's even worse now with easy to get high level gear... and oculus... well... it's oculus, they gave up on the make it count because also people with some knowledge could get it alread and tons of players avoiding the place is worse than give one achievement for free.<br />
<br />
No, before someone says that, brann's event isn't done yet with high gear since it's about not letting him get a single hit... and people can still let one mob slip and hit him even with the highest gear possible... with is sad.<br />
<br />
Guess they new achievements to do something to players from opposing faction will be done now in BGs/&quot;Wintergrasps&quot; hehehe nice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a good argument. Since shit was harder. Did u pull 10 mobs at a time in Silithus at level 60 with almost any class and had over ½ hp left when the mobs were dead, that kind of stunts were only pulled by some classes like mages that had really good AOE and CC. Nowadays u can just AOE grind everything with no problem at all, you have massive amount of HP, mobs don't hit much and you have uber gear that you got by running 5 mans.<br />
<br />
Elites are piss easy, almost any class can solo almost any elite in the game. Some of them hit hard but you hit harder and their low hp makes it an easy kill. I remember when some Elites in Vanilla that could only be killed by kiting for a long time (being a hunter I did it a lot), nowadays I just let my pet tank them and nuke em down quite fast in badge gear.<br />
<br />
So all in all things have ofc gotten easier because people know how to play, but IMO even more because everyone has so easy access to epic high quality gear. By just running dungeons you already have a kickass gear compared to what you got in Vanilla. When you had raided for 1 year in Vanilla and got full epic gear, the outside Raid content started to feel a bit easy, but even then you couldn't just Faceroll everything. There wasn't 5 mans that you did in 10 minutes even with full epic gear.<br />
<br />
Anyways why do we need to have Fast and Easy all the time? Every patch makes things easier and faster all the time. When do we reach a point where you just sit in town and don't even have to enter the instance to get stuff, it's pretty demanding anyways to kill monsters.</div></div><hr />

I don’t aprove to do that either.. as said I’m a pro to get people see the end-game.. but why don’t they keep some difficulty in it.. In my opinion people need to think/read up on encounters.. and not just smash there head to the keyboard/watch tv during the fight because only they need to keep the rotation going.. Everybody see endgame yes, but only if you know how to play the game.. and not because you had badges/loot of the nerf encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone brought the &quot;back in the day shit was harder&quot; argument again. That argument gets beaten by the &quot;you have hardmodes&quot; and &quot;there is no right lv difficulty&quot; arguments. Those 5 man nerfs are more of a &quot;this instance will be less annoying&quot; fix. Also players dont get their skills from 5 mans, they get their skills from friends and the internet (if they research their class).<br />
<br />
<br />
And don’t agree on that.. people get skills on dungeons if they are kept on there toes, and people need to think to do it.. As said above face rolling on keyboards/watch tv because people don’t need to pay attention anymore will also kill the high end stuff. If people not able to do 5 mans.. the nerfs will also happen in raids.. And the prove already there.. second wing open in icc and the first gets nerfed of being to hard.. It isn’tto hard you need to know tacts and need to pay attention.. still fire is hot walk out of it.. beam on you hurts run away from it… ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also vanilla wasn't hard it just had more people that didnt know what to do, right now we have lots of strats and guides on how to play our class well.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was hard m8 it was.. really if you didn’t pay attention or didn’t know tacts you just wiped the raid..It was more reading up.. more theo crafting etc. etc. now a days it is just lets get in and see what the fight is about.. ooh that fire..ouch.. dead… but 21 people can still do it and I can roll on loot.. yeah…</div></div><hr />

Festergut/Plagueworks difficulty<br />
Festergut is a pretty tough pile of flesh and stiches. So far we are pretty happy with the balancing in the Plagueworks and like how the progression is going. Yes, he is hard but that is pretty intentional and we will make changes if we feel they are necessary.<br />
<br />
Don't forget that we mentioned awhile back (link for reference: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=21038229051&amp;sid=1 ) that eventually there will be a buff for all players in the dungeon which will not directly be a nerf but will make the encounters easier to get past for those who are struggling. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/10/22418945972-my-festergut-experience-25.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok ok... wait... Festergut is hard? I'm not in a raiding guild, in my casual guild we run 10mans occasionally and we have been able to clear the first quarter of ICC 10 all 5 weeks up to now. We 1 shotted Festergut the week he came out but unfortunately only had a couple tries left on Rotface due to time constraints.<br />
<br />
I've not heard anything about problems with Festergut, just Rotface, especially on 10man because the ooze spawn timer is set to the same percentages as on 25man, and it's making the encounter ridiculous on 10 man.</div></div><hr />

A year back pulling two packs at once or pack and patrol would be 100% guaranteed. There were no over-geared 40k UB tanks, no 4k HPS healers, DPS had sub-20k hp and were not sporting 3k+ DPS.<br />
Changes to bosses makes the run smoother/faster, exactly the same updates that happened to other instances, ie HOL. The number of times Jadoga flies up does not change difficulty at all, or very minimally--if you can kill the follower first time, you most probably will do it each and every following time. What the number of repeated ascends does is prolonging the fight unnecessary.</div></div><hr />

Did u pull 10 mobs at a time in Silithus at level 60 with almost any class and had over ½ hp left when the mobs were dead, that kind of stunts were only pulled by some classes like mages that had really good AOE and CC. Nowadays u can just AOE grind everything with no problem at all, you have massive amount of HP, mobs don't hit much and you have uber gear that you got by running 5 mans.<br />
<br />
Elites are piss easy, almost any class can solo almost any elite in the game. Some of them hit hard but you hit harder and their low hp makes it an easy kill. I remember when some Elites in Vanilla that could only be killed by kiting for a long time (being a hunter I did it a lot), nowadays I just let my pet tank them and nuke em down quite fast in badge gear.<br />
<br />
So all in all things have ofc gotten easier because people know how to play, but IMO even more because everyone has so easy access to epic high quality gear. By just running dungeons you already have a kickass gear compared to what you got in Vanilla. When you had raided for 1 year in Vanilla and got full epic gear, the outside Raid content started to feel a bit easy, but even then you couldn't just Faceroll everything. There wasn't 5 mans that you did in 10 minutes even with full epic gear.<br />
<br />
Anyways why do we need to have Fast and Easy all the time? Every patch makes things easier and faster all the time. When do we reach a point where you just sit in town and don't even have to enter the instance to get stuff, it's pretty demanding anyways to kill monsters.<br />
<br />
<br />
yes everything was more grindy in vanilla. grindy=/=skill. CCing trash is annoying the only time i agree they make hard trash is when they make it so they dont respawn anymore; as far as elites(quests elites, etc) 2-3persons quests are solable but not the 5 person ones.</div></div><hr />

I know it would take away from one of the mage's abilities, but why can't we have portals between all the various capitol cities? Maybe they will do that in Cataclysm but require level 85 for use, as to not make the world feel too small for the lowbies.<br />

I consider it the hardest five-man instance in WotLK before 3.3 and harder than Naxxramas at that time. People talking about &quot;everything being easy already&quot; really have short memory. Sure it is piss-easy in ilevel 245+ gear.<br />
<br />
However fights where intermittent phases that you cannot speed up are triggered at certain percentage of the health of the boss rather than at certain time intervals simply get annoying when you outgear them heavily - five seconds of dpsing, than half a minute of waiting, fives seconds of dpsing, you get the picture. These nerfs make the fights easier on ungeared characters, true, but a year into Wrath those characters are alts more often than not. For geared players the nerfs are irrelevant with respect to difficulty, they only remove the annoyances. And if someone is worried about teaching new players (or old players on new characters), there is still ample opportunity to wipe in 3.3 instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vanilla wow was hard but mainly because of players learning to play a difficult game and gear not scaling the way it does now. Now things are going to seem and be easier in shiny ilvl 264 gear and such. However this is just a game and should be viewed as such and the wonderful thing about this game and other games is that you can always quit and not play $15 and find something else to do.<br />
<br />
Complaining on a forum about the game not being hard enough probably will solve nothing. So if it's that bad go and do something else or hell get into arena's and try to get glad/furious glad if you need a challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Prof change wasn't a nerf (the aura thing), it was a bug fix from last week.<br />
<br />
A new and exciting bug this week was that after tear gas, your abom and its pilot would sit there merrily stunned for a while after the rest of your raid (and the slimes, and the prof) woke up. This would almost certainly cascade out to an unavoidable wipe. It's a bug, it wasn't like that last week, and it has something or other to do with auras.<br />
<br />
It is possible that some of the more uber guilds could recover from this, but for a more casual guild like ours... not a chance.<br />

To follow up on the trent set in TOC I have a nice idea for u blizz, which will cure me from this game once and for all at the same time.<br />
<br />
What u guys should do is make raid instances in a way that when u zone in, the raid gets scanned, and then deemed either worthy of killing that boss or not, both visualized by a nice cinematic cutscene, and ofc 8 pieces of 500 ilvl loot if the scene shows us killing it, and if they fail an automatic GM ticketing service to whine about how the check failed and what u think will be better....<br />

Now what would really help this dungeon finder tool is an option to start the instance when 2 out of 3 dps accepted, but I think thats to much to ask for.</div></div><hr />

Old Kingdom has a VERY annoying spell in heroic mode that can easily cause a wipe, because stupid tanks and stupid dps don't know about it. The spell flingers cast a shadow attack that does 80% of the player's maximum health in damage http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59102 with a 6 second cast. The problem occurs when 2 of them get pulled and they both hit the tank at the same time, can easily cause a wipe (56-70k damage in one second is impossible to heal through when you have a tank with 35kHP) or if the tank has not gotten aggro on it since it didn't pull to him with the rest of the group and it targets the healer from healing aggro, one of those casts (15k damage on my holy paladin) at the same time as the 5k~ from a web pull I ate dirt and the group wiped. Seriously they just didn't understand that they NEED to kill the spell flinger or at least interrupt them first. I've NEVER had a problem in OK on my tank, because I assume the DPS are stupid and use raid marks. If the DPS interrupt things and get out of fires I'll compliment them. But I just assume they suck to begin with, and I'm never disappointed.</div></div><hr />

I'm not happy, you would still have to put up with a loading screen when you show up to claim your reward. Why not just have the reward given to you automatically once the dungeon finder creates the group? Then I wont have to leave the safety of Dalaran! ;-)</div></div><hr />

I always summoned my Army of the Dead before the first stun, so they would continue to beat on The Prophet throughout the stun, so I was quite surprised when there was no stun...and had done this a couple days before.</div></div><hr />

rofl seriously?<br />
<br />
It sure is hard and time consuming gearing up from i200-213 Naxx10 gear to full 219-245 gear with full T9 set. I mean it took me about a whole 12 hours /played on my DK alt.<br />
<br />

That's a hell of a lot better for the game than having to be in an uber-leet guild and put in 30 hours a week to see the absolutely amazing content of the past month or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed. I used to raid in Everquest (going back 7 years or so), was working from home so I could easily do 10+ hr raid days. I've seen very limited raid content in WoW, but it has always been far far easier than the time sink and difficulty of EQ raids. <br />
<br />
To put it simply, I've never wanted to put in the time to raid WoW, deal with the guild drama, or the time it took to run instances to get gear just to be able to raid.<br />
<br />
Transferred my old characters to a server with some family and friends, we have about 7 or 8 of us (5 that play regularly) in the guild. With the new Random Dungeon Finder we have been able to run Heroic instances together, and most of us are decked out in full (or close to it) T9 and Frozen Halls gear. Also with the addition of the weekly raid and Random Dungeon Finder a couple of us did our first 25 man raid last night to kill XT in Ulduar...was surprised to see I was actually 5th in damage output on the kill. The changes has actually meant I play and enjoy the game more, as I don't need to sit in Dalaran hoping to get a decent Heroic dungeon group together, deal with guild drama or wait around for people to get their shit together for raids/groups.<br />
<br />
The top guilds will always be the top guilds and the only thing the 5man Heroics and RDF does for them is help them gear their alts faster instead of having to grind them out, but it affords casual players an opportunity to visit content they may likely have never seen, especially with Cataclysm coming somewhat soon.</div></div><hr />

Having the item as BoE allows people who really want the item to get it via a trade or the auction house which I know several players have been able to do.

Also I do believe what someone else said about that it is old content who cares... As long as if the new content i.e. ICC isn't nerfed to cater a 4 year old, then it’s just fine. I still don't see people being able to clear all the way threw Ulduar, and they are complaining that it’s to easy?

Just ... out of curiosity. How in the hell are they pugging ICC10 Hardmode ... when you can't even ACCESS it until you beat LK in reg? And he's not even out yet. :x ...<br />
<br />
I understand if you are trying to make a point at how easy it is but ... that is the game now. I am semi happy about that change too. I absolutely hated raiders back then, the top end guilds had god syndrome going on because they believed they were better than everyone else. Big deal people can function in a large group and beat a GAME, those pixels never made them better than anyone else irl. I find these changes takes away the competitive nature the game was getting. It's a game for fun, and people were forgetting that, when their sole drive was to make someone else jealous, show off repeatedly and inflate their already massive ego by getting colorful digital art that made their character look cool.<br />

As of last night, I have been unable to gain souls for &quot;A Feast of Souls&quot; from &quot;The Damned&quot; coming out of the beginning of the instance, critters, or the insects that flock down right before Putricide (I'd assume the zombies from Precious/Stinky as well, but those were dead in the ID I tested last night). <br />
<br />
If your guild's Shadowmourne didn't already nom its 1,000 souls, it looks like unless you're going to put it on the backburner, to get them up you're going to need to actually organize rep-runs. Granted you could get people in Dalaran to do rep runs successfully, it's still a hassle as I personally had planned to read for the day while tapping the mobs at the beginning of the instance. <br />

But to anyone wondering &quot;why they nerfed the dungeons&quot; how does it affect you? Most people on here say the first 4 bosses in ICC are easy, so you outgear the dungeon anyway, and the changes are meant to make it FASTER not easier (altho it does do both) Heroics are run to get badges and loot to gear people...do YOU need both? IF NOT these changes have no affect on you, IF so WOOT faster badges. <br />
<br />
If your just upset because they keep making the game easier...go do the 4 new bosses in ICC on 25 man and have wet dreams about 25 (H) ICC, Heroics stopped being of any challenge for the most part the moment you stepped foot in Naxx...<br />
<br />

I've not heard anything about problems with Festergut, just Rotface, especially on 10man because the ooze spawn timer is set to the same percentages as on 25man, and it's making the encounter ridiculous on 10 man.<br />

Blood Presence turns itself off when you PvP flag?<br />
<br />
Note Blizzard has said a billion times they don't want to make base game mechanics change just because you move from PvE to PvP. They don't want every tooltip to double in size as it has what it does in PvE first then what it does or what changes in PvP second. Etc. They instead try to balance things such that they do the same THING in PvE vs PvP, they're just more useful in one or the other BECAUSE of what they do. So translating burst damage into sustained damage basically nerfs something for PvP while keeping it unchanged for PvE. Simply adding damage that vanishes when PvP flagged would be the &quot;simplest&quot; solution but is something Blizzard specifically wants to avoid because it could be confusing to players. &quot;Where'd my buff go?&quot;</div></div><hr />

The vast majority of the times I've wiped in OK is because A) People are completely unaware of their surroundings and pull an additional group with another Spell-Flinger in it, and B) After I've used up my Bash and Feral Charge interrupting their 40k spell, the 3 DPS are, as usual, oblivious and simply ignore the spell being cast. The only reason it doesn't 1-shot me is because I have 43k unbuffed, but it doesn't matter if it doesn't 1-shot me when there are 2 of them and they both cast their spell one after another unhindered. There is nothing a tank or healer can do about that if they've already done all they can to make up for idiotic DPS.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, stop ignoring spells you should interrupt because you're afraid your meter score will go down. Damage means nothing if you keep letting me die.<br />
<br />
Spell flinger's ability does a % of your HP. There is a reason it didnt 1 shot you in fresh 80 gear and it doesnt 1 shot you now. Heroic it does 80% of your HP and normal is like 50%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well exactly, now you CAN have slimes up before you change phase, making it easier. It is then, a nerf. But since they just buffed it in the last fix, i'm okay with this ;)</div></div><hr />

How about that? I can't get the fucking achievements in there with a top-tier group pulling nearly even DPS with the five ambers method, and nothing worked with five reds, and how about Less-rabi? How about a little less random luck?<br />
<br />
Stop nerfing things that don't need to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
And big fucking flaw in your logic with the hilts, Blizz, people need them TO sell them, screwing the people that want them out of them, and when you removed them from the skellies in PoS, you drastically lowered their drop rate overall for that dungeon.<br />
<br />
Oh, didn't think of that? Did you? Huduuuurrr.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What R U talking about?<br />
<br />
I got glory of the Hero (red proto) back in February in just Naxx gear. And so did anyone in my guild who wanted it.<br />
<br />
<br />
None of the actual achievements are hard enough to deserve a nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizz isn’t nerfing the difficulty of the instances in question…just allowing them to be completed in a more timely manner …so they are more in line with the other NR instances.</div></div><hr />
