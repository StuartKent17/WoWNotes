<meta name="description" content="TwentyFifthNovember kills Sartharion with 3 adds up 
This time, we can really say that TwentyFifthNovember cleared all the PvE content currently available in Wrath of the Lich King. They managed to kill Sartharion with all his adds up and were rewarded with the Reins of the Twilight Drake! I'm not really sure if it's worth discussing whether it was too easy or not, just keep in mind that they're the best PvE guild in the world for the moment, that's 60~80 players out of 11 millions.

Upcoming Feral changes, Part II<br />
On the subject of weapons, this change should be transparent to most druids. You will end up having a few more items that you can use, but your feral staves will continue to do the damage they do now. If it makes it clearer, imagine that feral attack power is not going away as a concept, but weapon dps will instead translate to their current FAP values. This is also not license for us to never again add weapons which are optimized for druids. It should just provide more options in between major upgrades.<br />
<br />
On the subject of armor, the intent of the change is to give you more options in which trinkets and other jewelry you use, instead of always having to rely on the (relatively rare) bonus armor pieces. (We don't think the solution of just dropping bonus armor pieces everywhere is a great one either -- no single stat should trump the others by that much.) The change isn't intended to be a nerf at all. A lot of numbers have been thrown around in this thread. Give me some time to review them and see where any discrepancies lie.<br />
<br />
Our design remains to have fewer specialized items drop so that more loot is actually valued by someone in the group. A lot of the druid itemization was a relic of the older system and we have been wanting to convert it over. But with any change like this, it may take some time before all of the rough edges are smoothed over. To use a tired cliche, the designers tend to take the stance that the design of WoW is a journey not a destination.<br />
<br />
On the myriad of other topics...<br />
<br />
I realize some players have made some passionate and intelligent arguments for other ways in which bears can scale from gear. That isn't something we are going to do at the moment, but something we may investigate in the future. I understand that it's fun to improve tanking gear, and while we don't want it to be such a burden to get the +armor pieces, we also don't want the choices to be so meaningless that you aren't gearing for tanking at all. Let's see how things stand after these changes go live.<br />
<br />
We are not adding additional weapons that druids can use at the moment, but we may consider it in the future.<br />
<br />
Block is a very good stat now, and we have read a lot about the notion that &quot;unblocked hits are the new crushing blows.&quot; We don't want the block mechanic to mean that death knights and druids (and possibly even paladins) are left behind. Again the goal is to have four viable tank classes. That doesn't mean identical, but it also doesn't mean that druids get swapped out for some fights or relegated to permanent off-tank status.

You are a complete moron and just did a worthless job attempting to link my comment and your idiotic analogy. The Olympics is a career goal, and something extremely difficult to accomplish, it is something you DO dedicate your life to or you don't have a chance in the world even getting to compete. If this game is truly as easy as these guys have been complaining on their website, simply chosing to take days off of work/school or even abandon them and play for 27 hours straight is not worth a kilobyte of bandwith. The blue posts were enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well obviously they take this game seriously and dedicate perhaps unhealthy ammount of time in order to acomplish what they do . Your comment regarding that guilds that cleared Hyjal/BT pre3.0 could do the same might be right but they didn't , simply because they didn't dedicate the time to kill these bosses because at end , end-game was always about how much time you dedicate in it to archive what you want , the stuff was and always be time consuming and the more time you are willing to sarcrifice the more you are bound to archive.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention that Olympics athlets doesn't have a &quot;beta training&quot; that only a few are choosen to do, so they can have advantage when the Olympic Games &quot;goes live&quot;.<br />

I only hope that:<br />
<br />
1) They stop crying for content, since THEY choose to finish the entire xpac in a week;<br />
2) Blizz doesn't go nuts and start to rush content in before their original schedule;<br />
3) No more &quot;Beta club&quot; for a few select people to train and do it fast and 1st on live. Part of the fun is actually every single player discovering a lot of stuff on day 1 (live) and not comming with a beta book saying what to do and what to not...</div></div><hr />

Those are things you need talent for, if you want to be the best. Any half decent player who just dedicates enough time on this game can do what they did. After all it are scripted events which require a good reaction time at most. <br />
<br />
Anyways I'm glad they are clearing it so easily. This means more people will be able to see and experience the content. I quit the game a few weeks after TBC, because TBC raiding was just horrible. We kept wiping in karazhan with a guild who had done Naxx and the top guilds weren't doing any better. Glad they are not making that same mistake this time.</div></div><hr />

And this is where you are wrong. Some people could spend months on some bosses and still couldn't beat them. It's lame to assume that &quot;I can do it too if I had the time they have&quot;. They take things more serious than others, and that makes them special. Like it or not. It's just the same with other things too.<br />
Just because you spend the same amount of time practicing some sports doesn't make you fit to play in the major league. <br />
<br />
But it's sooo easy to just say, &quot;well, of course they can beat the game faster than me, because they have more time&quot;, instead of doing the same.</div></div><hr />

I say it again. Even with all the time in the world, you guys couldn't beat the content as fast as they do.<br />
That's the accomplishment. Is that so hard to realize?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And second. Why do people whine about these guys having no RL and that the raid for a living? I personally dont think there is 1 company on earth who wants to pay 30-40 people a full wage enough to live for just so they can advertise after getting world firsts. So, 25Nov got Wow as a hobby. And now when they cleared the content they can relax for 1-2 moths before the next patch. Grinding reputation, gold, level professionell or just go outside and enjoy life itselfs.<br />
<br />
Ok, they spent an enormous amount of time leveling up, clearing the 25-men content. But, just like the article says. They are a small bunch of people out of 11 million people who just happens to be professional Wow-players.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelfarr</div><div class="date">2008-11-21, 11:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone else kinda feel like this is hurting end-game raiding overall? I mean if a guild can clear all end-game raid content 1 week after the expansion hits, it gives end-game raiding almost a generic feeling. I don't even really care what the boss fights were like or what gear drops they got; however, when guilds were clearing AQ, Naxx, and BC raids I was always intrigued about the new bosses and gear and so on.<br />
<br />
Those are actual jobs that provide an income to make a living and have an outlet in which to inspire and affect a large audience. When Warcraft starts having it's own prime-time television show on a major network to show top guilds raiding then that will become a valid comparison.<br />
<br />
<br />
Since when is the karazhan of wotlk end game? Naxx is so fucking easy. My guild only has 2 bosses left(sapph and KT) on 10 man naxx and they cleared the whole thing only doing 2-3 hours a night. Its so easy.</div></div><hr />

Not sure its fair counting China when they can't actually access this content. Those guys are nuts, they'd have somehow got level 80 and done the same 3 hours and 41 minutes after release, or something.<br />

Four players would have died in the process, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're a bunch of conceited morons. Let them play the game how they want to instead of whining and belittling them at every opportunity. Easy content is easy. The less challenge you have, the less rewarding it will feel to beat it. I remember wiping on c'thun for weeks with my guild, and the feeling from finally defeating it was pure bliss. Now you can rush through all new raiding content, and the only thought you're left with after doing it is a disappointed &quot;was that it?&quot;</div></div><hr />

If these guys are saying the game is too easy, then who cares that they were the first to beat it? They didn't beat the game within a healthy play period of playing the game. I'd be willing to bet that EVERY guild who at least cleared BT and MH pre-3.0.2 who spends the same amount of /played time (not just RL played time, which these guys just crammed in w/o no regard to RL) could do the same thing. Other people have real lives, and promoting these guys like they are special is definitely a desperate reach for news.<br />
<br />
Moral of the story: If there isn't anything newsworthy to report, just take a day off. Don't get desperate. Besides, unless the fight dramatically changed from Beta, whomever did it in Beta was really the first to have done it.<br />

Take a guild who hasn't been in beta and they'll have a much harder time clearing those raids.<br />
<br />
And sure, being sponsored also makes things easier. And gives more incentive for clearing the content. I sure as heck would love to be sponsored for playing WoW.<br />

Now my 2cents here but it would be EXTREMELY boring for me to finish the game that I've been waiting the most in just 3 days or 1 week, if they love it that way then good for them. I can't wait to start raiding 25s again with my guild but so far I have enjoyed the lore enough to keep it slow and have fun at my own pace.<br />

<br />
<br />
and now they're done ? I mean... they didn't even get enough time after release to run enough heroics or raids to gear up for them either (one heroic of an instance a day ... if it's still like that)<br />
<br />
Have to admit they're good... but It's not going to make me want to level faster ! I like the game as I play it. .. and imo I wouldn't want to go that fast .... what about the lore ?! I mean, it's so great in the few quests I did up until now ...<br />
<br />
most probably, each person in this guild will be using an alt (if they like the lore) to go back and do the quests and read the text :) .... or else they don't like to play, they just like the pride of finishing quickly ^^;</div></div><hr />

I really don't understand why people try to trivialize an accomplishment just because they wouldn't personally spend the time or effort to do it themselves.<br />
<br />
As far as people complaining about how fast the content is being beaten, you guys should consider that the only reason content wasn't beaten this quickly before(specifically pre-TBC) is because Blizzard would always make it near impossible on release and then nerf it in a later patch. I don't see anything wrong with them making the content beatable from the start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) They stop crying for content, since THEY choose to finish the entire xpac in a week;<br />
2) Blizz doesn't go nuts and start to rush content in before their original schedule;<br />
3) No more &quot;Beta club&quot; for a few select people to train and do it fast and 1st on live. Part of the fun is actually every single player discovering a lot of stuff on day 1 (live) and not coming with a beta book saying what to do and what to not...<br />
<br />
You're an idiot.<br />
<br />
1) You're saying they should have gimped themselves and not done something that they could? They're trying to be the best guild in the world. Why would they look at a challenge and say, &quot;Yeah, we could do that - but let's go do dailies instead and save it for another day.&quot; Also, show me one place where anyone from that guild has &quot;cried for content&quot;. Good luck.<br />
<br />
2) Yeah, we want Blizz to put out a high quality, balanced and good product...<br />
<br />
3) ...without any testing of it whatsoever. Getting rid of Beta has to be the single most inept thing I've ever read here. You're delirious if you think that a handful of guys at Blizzard could ever properly test out the things they're releasing.<br />
<br />
Again, you're an idiot.</div></div><hr />

uhm its that uberguild who says its too easy. thereby stating that all dedicated guilds will beat the content quickly. Lets see if that is true first shall we? most top guilds havent even reached 80 yet.<br />
<br />
big grats though for that amazing feat nevertheless in all its strangeness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They weren't in beta, they were in the alpha testing phase ( I got the chance to talk to a few :) ), and when naxx testing began, they were allotted access to a private blizzard server, designed for testing and monitoring raid content done by top tier guilds. <br />
<br />
Even if they hadn't done this, the fights are 99% the same as they were at lvl 60, and the dps/healing/skill requirements are below that of a sunwell clearing guild.<br />
<br />
THIS CONTENT WAS DESIGNED TO BE EASY<br />
<br />
They already stated that the early content would be easy to do for end game raiding guilds (sunwell cleared or progress therein before 3.0.2). If it wasn't there would be no &quot;entry&quot; raid for the casuals. That happened with naxx. I saw lesser guilds PROGRESSING in naxx after 4-5 months. I even saw a few guilds who couldn't kill moroes. They designed naxx as a stepping stone for the guilds who rant to raid but are just god awful at wow. <br />
<br />
It was also said that raids would, and very rapidly, ramp up in difficulty. <br />
<br />
I have to say for me personally, naxx is still pretty easy... but it's fun. I'm having a blast just casually running raids and heroics, pvping on the side, and just generally relaxing. after 3 years of hard raiding this is a great change. I fully expect to go back to hardcore progression (as hardcore as 12 hours a week gets) after 3.1 however. <br />
<br />
Oh, and Malygos is NOT by any means easy, and what they did here, killing sartharian with 3 drakes up, really is an amazing feat considering they still have sunwell gear. It's not easy by any stretch.</div></div><hr />

It's not done anywhere, ever, with the English language. In English, numbers are treated as nouns, and as million is modified by 11, it is not pluralized. This may be different with his own language, but it is not the correct usage in English.</div></div><hr />

Everyone can try that (the career). If they can reach the goal (the gold medal) is a diferent story.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a &quot;beta training center.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
As for random beta selection, well, I got in, and I'm in no bleeding-edge guild. Can I teach my guild the Sartharion encounter? No problem. Nothing is particularly hard or complicated. My first Sartharion kill was with a PuG 10-man, in which we had zero people who'd done the fight before, and most raid members were in either dungeon blues or premade gear (that's over a 5% miss chance on my premade Hunter, less crit than my live BT/Hyjal Hunter had, and only about 200 more AP unbuffed.) We one-shotted every mini-boss, then two-shotted Sarth, and we weren't special. Everyone did.<br />
<br />
The real tests in this expansion (if any exist, and I hope they do) are yet to come. When the PTR drops, get your guild into it and learn Ulduar, then full-clear it first. Nothing's stopping you that isn't stopping them.<br />
<br />
These guys didn't beat anything with special knowledge; they beat it with special hard work and coordination. If that bothers you that WoW players are impressed by such a feat, perhaps you should do a quick /played and ask yourself, &quot;Is this game worth so much time?&quot;</div></div><hr />

and sure you can.. anybody can run 100m, only a group of 8 or 9 can do it under 10 seconds....<br />
<br />
and whats the difference between anybody and those 8 or 9... those 8 or 9 practice every waking moment of their lives.... these days they DO get paid a good amount of money for it... <br />
<br />
but 10 years ago, olympic atheletes were paid nothing. <br />
<br />
if you dont like comparing WoW to the Olympics... compare WoW to World Poker Championship... same shit... luck, &quot;skill&quot; and dedication.<br />
<br />
<br />
In case you didnt read my previous post, it stated that &quot;wow is not like the olympics&quot; ;) Therefor it is without question uncomparable, winning the gold medal is a true physical and mental feat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FASTEST CLEARING PvE guild in the world? Yes. <br />
<br />
Best? Im not sure. Since everybody has the capacity to kill all the bosses they did just in a longer amount of time from actually getting to 80 first, but once a guild has enough 80s to do 25 mans they should blow through the content as fast as they had, nothing is hard anymore.<br />
<br />
I do not think Fastest = Best when everything is stupidly easy to clear.</div></div><hr />

sorry i skimmed your post and must have thought it was the same as another previous one.<br />
<br />
but shame clearing nax isn't &quot;winning gold&quot; in wow.... <br />
<br />
i'm not comparing the physicality and mental aspect of olympics to WoW... im comparing the fact that in both situations the people involved literarly abandon their &quot;RL&quot; to focus on this one thing for a period of time. Thats dedication. I'm not saying its a good thing. I wouldn't abandon my RL to win a gold medal, or clear a raid. but i understand.<br />

they don't need to make a salary to live in their mother's basement.. all they need is a computer, free online access and free subscription to WoW.... they have no kids to feed, mortgage to pay etc.... so they are making a 'living' :p .. their mom's cook for them and stuff :)</div></div><hr />

Just because YOU live in your mother's basement doesn't mean everyone that plays WoW does. Many successful raiders are married, have families, jobs, etc. In fact, I am willing to bet all my gold that a majority of 25th November is older than you. I guarantee it.<br />
<br />
I also guarantee that they have bigger houses than you, make more money than you, and spend just as much time playing as you, they just play faster when they are on.<br />
<br />
I love how everyone says &quot;this isn't an accomplishment, WoW is so easy!&quot; So why haven't you done it yet? And if it is easy, then how could they spend all their time doing it? Since WoW is so mindless, they obviously just spent like, one night of attempts and then got it down, right?</div></div><hr />

Dude. WoW is easy. I don't see how you can possibly say it isn't. Especially the PvE aspects of WoW.<br />
<br />
They didn't spend just one night, they spent a number of nights in Beta learning the fight.<br />
<br />
Calling them the best players in WoW in this news story is laughable, but I guess that all depends on your definition of &quot;best&quot;. If being the &quot;best&quot; in WoW means more time put into it, then of course they're the best. The skill cap on WoW is so low though, that there's no way that guild can be the &quot;best at the game&quot;, they just have more time invested into the game, and imo time invested is not equal to &quot;best&quot;. There's a countless number of players in this game that are probably better then those 60 or 80 as was quoted in the story.<br />
<br />
Okay, so are they the &quot;best&quot; guild then? Probably not for the same reasons that their guild is not made up of the &quot;best&quot; players.</div></div><hr />

Actually to be more accurate, it would be like people who won a golden medal in the &quot;special&quot; Olymipcs.

I looked an you are absolutly right, there were 3 other questions about the muti image of the toon. But where it is asked once or a hundred times there is never a acceptable reason to be rude to a simple non aggressive question. <br />
What I did also notice u have taken personaly to awnser the question everytime like it means somthing to you. If you feel its a &quot;stupid&quot; post or &quot;ignorant &quot; post its never alright to be ill mannered about it, just let it go since it doesnt effect you in the game nor in real life. <br />

the fact that it takes luck skill and dedication as i said is what im comparing.<br />
<br />
luck to be born with the genetics.<br />
skill developed with training<br />
and dedicated enough to give up a lot of things people think are important.<br />
<br />
they have the luck of being in the guild in the first place and having the time from responsibilities.<br />
they developed the strategies needed to overcome the scripts. <br />
they are dedicated enough to give up other things to play the game.<br />
<br />
the people in the guild aren't BETTER than us in EVERY WAY (neither are olympic athelets)<br />
<br />
ps: running in a straight line is very scripted imo, lol.</div></div><hr />

If you think of it that way, you can compare it to just about anything. Winning the lottery for example. It takes luck winning. It takes skill to learn how to write and recognize the numbers. It takes dedication going to the store and buying a lottery ticket every week. <br />
<br />
Anyways good for them, I hope they won't whine about new content. Just got a bit annoyed by people who idolize these people and compare it to other levels of dedication that can not possibly be related. If you want more in depth examples how it can not be compared, I'll be glad to PM you :P Going too far OT here, hehe.</div></div><hr />

Go spend some of your time finding some passion that isn't a video game. Music? Art/Photography/Creative writing. A real-life girl? These are a few of my favourite things..<br />
<br />
Look!! A nerd on wow forums, pretending to have a life. Let's all point and laugh at him. ahahahah</div></div><hr />

I hope that as more people clear the content we will all get to enjoy this game and have fun. Perhaps when we have all had a chance to go to Naxx or any of the other events that this expansion has to offer, then we will be able to have a civilized conversation about how easy or hard things are. I, however, do not feel qualified to make any decisions about the difficulty of a dungeon based on the success of someone else. <br />
<br />
To the folks over at 25th, thank you for your work now and in the past to share your experience with the rest of us in this community. The work that the top guilds do is what the rest of us stand upon later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of them are fully epic'd out with level 80 epics from heroics and Naxxramas gear (what I assume is the equivalent of the old tier 4, or tier 7? Not sure)<br />
<br />
BTW They aren't paid to play. Pro gaming doesn't work like that at all. SK only ever get their plane fares/pc equipment paid for in CS/CSS/W3/Quake. It's not an actual wage they just get freebies and expenses paid for by the sponsers. In this case there's no travelling so I'd guess the classleaders get a free mouse mat, mouse, maybe keyboard or monitor if they're lucky. No equivalent of a wage they're skipping college/work just for the thrill of it. If it makes them happy - live and let live ;) They're hurting nobody.<br />
<br />
I know they're not SK or mouz anymore, but they also generating revenue from website ads, subscriptions models, reselling on the site. All very low income stuff compared to a normal 9-5. It was/is the LAN prizes that earn the big money, which strangely WoW has none, so the point of doing it for money is redundent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sartharion heroic is easy. Sartharion heroic with 1 add up is decent. Sartharion heroic with 2 adds up is hard. Sartharion heroic with 3 adds up is close to impossible with the current gear.<br />
<br />
Imagine doing M'uru pre-nerf with Kalecgos hitting your MT in the middle with constant Corrosion up.<br />
That's what it's like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A guild clears content very, very quickly. You all complain about how they did it too fast. (no life)<br />
A guild clears content very, very slowly. You all complain about how they did it too late. (months behind)<br />
<br />
It seems to me that most of you will ever be happy that content is being cleared, no matter what the circumstance, no matter how easy or hard it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But since two top guilds joined up wheres the thrill? Wheres the competition?<br />
<br />
If they become just the best avalible team everyone will just assume they would do something first in the world. If they do, they will yawn. If they don't they will laugh at them, hard.<br />
<br />
Personally I find the Ozzy Osbourne commercial much more interesting. Although I like Mr. T and the paladin guy much much more because they're funny;)<br />
<br />
Also, like some people posted, terrible screenshots. L2EDIT.</div></div><hr />

Totally aggreed, I guess the wow PVE content is too quickly dead to have a big interest for sponsors, they have materials etc but that doesn't mean they get paid each months to play.. $ are spent on the PvP playground</div></div><hr />
