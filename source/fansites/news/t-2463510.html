Tides of Vengeance Update Notes<br />
For ages untold, Dazar’alor has stood at the center of the great and powerful Zandalari empire. Its guards have thwarted numerous attempts on King Rastakhan’s life, and it has endured trials both ancient and new. But as war reaches the shores of Zuldazar, the Alliance embarks on a daring gambit to besiege the golden pyramid and sever the Zandalari’s bond to the Horde.<br />
<br />
New Raid – Battle of Dazar’alor<br />
The Battle of Dazar’alor is now open. The Alliance is set to stage an attack on the heart of the Zandalari empire in a bid to sever the ties of the Zandalari and the Horde, while Horde players will begin the raid by defending against an invasion in the northern jungle of Zuldazar.<br />
<br />
Along the way, players will get to shift to the other faction’s perspective and take on three additional bosses. For the first time in a raid, your character will transform into the opposite faction (including their associated racial abilities).<br />
<br />
A dozen new, formidable boss encounters, including Lady Jaina Proudmoore and King Rastakhan himself, await you!<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic difficulty and Raid Finder Wing 1 will open with scheduled weekly maintenance in each region the week of January 29, 2019.<br />
Raid Finder Wing 2 will open the week of February 12, 2019, and Raid Finder Wing 3 will open the week of February 26, 2019.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth Season 2<br />
Both the adventures and the war being waged across Azeroth are signified by seasons: times at which many factors and measurements change. Today begins Season 2 of Battle for Azeroth, and you’ll find many new challenges and new rewards are now available in Dungeons and PvP content.<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
A new season of rewards from dungeons has begun. Complete your best Mythic Keystone each week to earn higher item-level gear, and save up your Titan Residuum to purchase new, powerful Azerite items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Item levels of rewards from level 120 Normal, Heroic, and Mythic dungeons have been increased by 30. Baseline rewards are now item-level 340 from Normal, 355 from Heroic, and 370 from non-Keystone Mythic dungeons.<br />
The difficulty of Heroic and Mythic dungeons has been increased by 30%. Normal difficulty dungeons are unchanged.<br />
Mythic Keystones have been reduced by an additional 3 levels, to account for this difficulty increase.<br />
Mythic Keystone rewards have been increased by 30 item levels. During the first week of Season 2, rewards from end-of-run chests will be capped at item-level 385, and the reward cache contains a Season 1 reward.<br />
Beginning the second week of Season 2, the weekly cache will not be affected by the cap, and will reward Season 2 items at the higher item levels.<br />
Added a new Tier 3 Mythic Keystone affix: Reaping. This bestows the power of Bwonsamdi on all non-boss creatures in the dungeon, giving them a chance to avenge their own deaths.<br />
The Infested affix has been removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
Battle for Azeroth PvP Season 2 is now underway. Ranks and ratings have been reset, and you can now begin earning new rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 2 rewards from PvP sources have been increased by 30 item-levels. This includes Conquest rewards and the weekly chest.<br />
Players who earn 500 Conquest points in a given week now receive one Quartermaster’s Coin and an item from that week’s selection.<br />
Players might also earn an additional piece of gear or Quartermaster’s Coin each week by using a weekly bonus roll token in PvP.<br />
Quartermaster’s Coins can be exchanged for a Warlord’s Trophy, which can be used to upgrade a piece of Sinister Gladiator gear to a higher item level.<br />
During weeks when the Conquest reward is a head, shoulder, or chest item, players can choose from one of four different pieces of Azerite gear. For the weeks when the Conquest reward is not an Azerite piece, trinket, or weapon, players will be able to choose gear from one of two different slots such as legs and wrists, hands and back, or finger and feet.<br />
The PvP reward UI now shows the criteria needed to receive your weekly chest. Elite sets (available to earn for a limited time only) can also be viewed in the Appearances interface on the Sets tab.<br />
Players can now work toward earning the Vicious Black Bonesteed or Vicious Black Warsaber. Once earned, fill the bar again to receive a Vicious Saddle, which can be used to purchase a mount from previous seasons.<br />
The Gladiator title and achievement are can now be earned by winning 50 games in 3v3 Arenas above a 2400 rating. Players in the top 0.1% at the end of Season 2 in this bracket will earn the Sinister Gladiator title.<br />
End-of-match rewards will be capped at item-level 385 during the first week of the season, to maintain parity with other endgame systems until Mythic Battle of Dazar’alor becomes available.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items and Rewards Updates<br />
New epic Azerite gear is now available from Season 2 PvP, the Battle of Dazar’alor raid, World Quest Emissaries, and from the Mythic Keystone vendor Thaumaturge Vashreen in Zuldazar and Boralus. These new items will have a fifth ring with additional new trait options, starting at Heart of Azeroth level 15.<br />
<br />
The new ring of traits provides two choices of traits per specialization, allowing players the opportunity to find items that have traits they particularly want and the freedom to create new and interesting combinations that may not have been possible before.<br />
<br />
Further changes to items and rewards include:<br />
<br />
<br />
Azerite Knowledge will increase weekly from January 22 through March 26.<br />
The maximum possible item level is now 425 (was 395).<br />
Seals of Wartorn Fate have not been changed or reset, and will be used for Battle of Dazar’alor and other Season 2 bonus rolls.<br />
Emissary weapon and armor rewards will scale up to item-level 385 (was 370).<br />
Loot from Kul Tiras and Zandalar world bosses will remain at item-level 355.<br />
Rewards for in-progress emissary quests may reroll or update when Season 2 begins; the quests themselves won’t reset or change.<br />
The Titan Residuum vendor now offers item-level 385, 400, and 415 gear.<br />
Titan Residuum is not reset or capped between seasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warfronts<br />
<br />
Darkshore Warfront rewards have been increased by 15 item levels, and the outdoor world boss and the once-per-cycle quest now award item-level 400 gear.<br />
The power of all enemies in the Darkshore Warfront have been increased by 15%, and the item level required to queue for Darkshore is now 335 (was 320).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: These Darkshore changes will take effect after the current Warfront cycle has ended. If an attack is already underway in your region, the Warfront will give Season 1 rewards until the attack phase ends. This is being done to avoid any unfairness to people who had already completed the Warfront or killed the world boss before the start of the new season.<br />
<br />
Rewards from Arathi Basin and Stromgarde Warfront have not changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mythic Keystone Dungeon Season 2 Has Begun!<br />
The new Mythic Keystone dungeon season has begun, and there are new rewards to earn—along with a new challenge to face within the hallowed halls of Battle for Azeroth’s dungeons.<br />
<br />
New Seasonal Affix<br />
Season 2 features a new seasonal affix—Reaping—which will appear on level 10 or higher Keystones. High-level Keystones will now summon Bwonsamdi, the Loa of Death, to wreak some spectral havoc upon players’ dungeon run. As heroes kill enemies, the vanquished spirits will continue to linger in the mortal realm. At certain points throughout the dungeon, Bwonsamdi will resurrect these twisted souls, who will swarm the unfortunate adventurers in a final act of vengeance.<br />
<br />
Updated Mythic Difficulty and Rewards<br />
With the start of Season 2, the rewards from dungeons have increased by up to 30 item levels, and the difficulty of Heroic and Mythic dungeons has likewise been increased. To align with the current available reward cap, during the first week of Season 2, rewards from end-of-run chests will be capped at Mythic 6 quality (item level 385).<br />
<br />
The weekly cache that becomes available in the second week of the season will not be affected by this cap. Players who complete a Mythic 10 Keystone dungeon during the first week will receive a Mythic 10 reward (item level 410+) from their cache the following week.<br />
<br />
Titan Residuum and Azerite Armor Updates<br />
We’ve also added a new way for players who participate in Mythic Keystone dungeons to acquire specific Azerite armor. Players can now use Titan Residuum to purchase specific items from Mythic Keystone vendor Thaumaturge Vashreen, who is located in either Zuldazar or Boralus.<br />
<br />
These new Azerite pieces will have a fifth ring of traits. This new outer ring provides two trait choices per specialization, giving players opportunities to find items that have traits they particularly want—and the freedom to create new and interesting combinations that may not have been possible before. This additional ring of traits also makes each item have a larger impact on your character’s overall power. Learn more about the latest Azerite armor updates in our post (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22864558/tides-of-vengeance-part-2-azerite-armor-updates-changes).<br />
<br />
Titan Residuum will not reset or cap between seasons. Vendor Thaumaturge Vashreen will offer gear of item levels 385, 400, and 415 for purchase during Season 2.<br />
<br />
Random Token Costs<br />
<br />
Item Level 385 - 165 Titan Residuum<br />
Item Level 400 - 675 Titan Residuum<br />
Item Level 415 - 1725 Titan Residuum<br />
<br />
<br />
Specific item-level 415 armor pieces cost 7,150 Titan Residuum.<br />
<br />
Along with the increased costs for tokens, disenchanting or scrapping Azerite armor pieces with a higher item level will likewise result in higher yields of Titan Residuum.<br />
<br />
Disenchanting Examples:<br />
<br />
Item Level 400 - 165 Titan Residuum<br />
Item Level 415 - 365 Titan Residuum<br />
<br />
<br />
We’ve also adjusted the amount of Titan Residuum that can be gained from your weekly cache. A Mythic 4 dungeon in Season 2 will award approximately the same amount (60) of Titan Residuum that a Mythic 10 dungeon from Season 1 did. A weekly cache from a Mythic 10 dungeon should result in approximately 625 Titan Residuum.<br />
<br />
Keep an eye on the Mythic Keystone Dungeon Leaderboards (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/game/pve/leaderboards/) to see how you match up.<br />
<br />

Yep. Planted some myself 5 months ago .... not &quot;onto&quot; though. Under. Considering how many other Alliance players did the same thing, I'd say every ship was an easy feat.<br />

That's about the only redeeming thing about this mess.<br />
<br />
Why isn't it always this easy? Just sneak in and plant tons of bombs, then win. Huzzah! I mean, it's not like this was a city riddled with trained battle animals and animal-based demigods, all of whom have superior senses to detect stealth infiltrators. And it's not like one the world's foremost naval powers would ever bother to inspect the hulls of their ships on the regular, which is like the 101 of ship maintenance.<br />
<br />
I hate contrived solutions to story problems.</div></div><hr />

i have more problem with something else - in begiing of expansion she had enough power to literaly rise ship from deepth of ocean and not only fly it but also make arcane cannons etc but now all she could do is a lousy little shield onto herself ? <br />
<br />
thats just bad writing. but fuck the lore i guess.</div></div><hr />

In earlier days there was always a plan that made sense. The bad guys had plans, the good guys had plans, and they were all well thought trough and just sometimes failed in execution, as all plans do eventually. But nowadays it's just some generic Hollywood action script where everyone has super powers when they fit and completely forget about them in the next scene, just as it pleases the lazy writers.<br />
<br />
Remember in the BFA intro cinematic at Lordaeron when Jaina erased an army with a single spell and controlled her flying super-ship with magic cannons with one hand and made it destroy the walls of that city? Well too bad she forgot about all those power and now can barely hold up a shield to block a single ballista bolt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All she did was freeze the floor so the blight would stop moving temporarily. And here, she was holding several attacks... not clearly seen though, but they didn't show any ship sinking. It's either offensive or defensive, not both.<br />

The only thing that really makes no sense at all is how a hole was made into the ship and Mekkatorque AND its machine were not even scratched.</div></div><hr />

Sure this is much less work to do for cinematic team - instead of portraying the naval fight with all the mighty heroes of the alliance and the Horde they can get away with 1 human girl, 1 gnome and cheap explosions.</div></div><hr />
