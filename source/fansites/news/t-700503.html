Last week, we gave you an early look at the changes we’re making to the stat system in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, and explained how these changes will ultimately provide players with more interesting gear choices and make stats easier to understand. Today we’d like to go into more detail about a brand-new feature that’s an integral part of this overhaul: the Mastery system, a set of new game mechanics designed to allow players to become better at what makes their chosen talent tree cool or unique. With this system, we want to accomplish three things: give players more freedom in how they allocate talent points, simplify some of the “kitchen sinky” talents that try to do too much at once, and add a new stat to high-level gear that makes you better at your chosen role.<br />
<br />
Here’s how the system works: As you spend points in a given talent tree, you’ll receive three different passive bonuses specific to that tree. The first bonus will increase your damage, healing, or survivability, depending on the intended role of the tree. The second bonus will be related to a stat commonly found on gear desirable to you, such as Haste or Crit. The third bonus will be the most interesting, as it will provide an effect completely unique to that tree -- meaning there will be 30 different bonuses of this nature in the game. This third bonus is the one that will benefit from the Mastery rating found on high-level (level 80 to 85) gear.<br />
<br />
One of our primary goals with Mastery is to give players more flexibility to choose fun or utility-oriented talents rather than make them feel obligated to pick up “mandatory” but uninteresting talents, such as passive damage or healing. (For examples of the kinds of powerful but boring talents we’re talking about, take a look at the talent tier just above the 51-point talent in many of the existing trees.) In a sense, Mastery makes it so every talent in (just for example) a rogue tree essentially has an invisible additional bullet point that says “???and increases your damage by X%.” This way, if you choose a talent like Elusiveness (which reduces your chance to be detected while stealthed) or Fleet Footed (which affects movement), you won’t feel like you’re giving up damage in exchange for utility.<br />
<br />
There will still be talents that boost damage, of course, but those talents will also affect the way you play. For example, you can still expect to see talents like Improved Frostbolt, which reduces the cast time of the Frostbolt spell; it increases DPS, but it also affects the mage’s rotation. Piercing Ice, however, is just “6% more damage” and is the kind of talent we’re trying to eliminate by implementing the Mastery system.<br />
<br />
As we get closer to Cataclysm’s release, we’ll go into more detail about the changes coming for each class, including individual talent-tree adjustments and how Mastery will affect them. In the meantime, here are a few examples to demonstrate the three kinds of passive bonuses we described above. Please keep in mind that we're still working on this system, and the handful of examples we're providing here are, of course, subject to change.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Holy Priest<br />
For each talent point spent in the Holy tree, the priest also gets:<br />
<br />
Healing – Improves your healing by X%.<br />
<br />
Meditation – Improves your mana regeneration from Spirit in combat. This would likely replace the existing Meditation talent from the Discipline tree, which many Holy priests consider to be a “must-have.” Regeneration will also probably be determined by whether you are in or out of combat, and not the “five-second rule.<br />
<br />
Radiance – Adds a heal-over-time effect to direct heals, such as Flash Heal. Mastery on gear would boost this bonus, and no other talent tree would grant it.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Discipline Priest<br />
For each talent point spent in the Discipline tree, the priest also gets:<br />
<br />
Healing – Improves your healing by X%.<br />
<br />
Meditation – Improves your mana regeneration from Spirit in combat. This would likely replace the existing Meditation talent.<br />
<br />
Absorption – Improves the amount of damage absorbed by spells such as Power Word: Shield and Divine Aegis. Mastery on gear would boost this bonus, and no other talent tree would grant it.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Frost Death Knight<br />
For each talent point spent in the Frost tree, the death knight also gets:<br />
<br />
Damage – Improves your melee and spell damage by X%.<br />
<br />
Haste – Improves your melee Haste by Y%. This might allow us to remove some of the Haste in the Icy Talons line of talents.<br />
<br />
Runic Power – Improves the rate of runic power generated by abilities. While all death knights want runic power, Frost death knights would generally have more runic power than Blood or Unholy death knights (who would receive a different benefit from their respective trees). An Unholy death knight who sub-specs into Frost would still be able to benefit from this bonus, though because they’re investing fewer talent points, they’d benefit to a smaller degree. Mastery on gear would boost this bonus, and no other talent tree would grant it.<br />
<br />
A couple other things to note: Currently, we’re not planning to retrofit the Mastery stat onto current level-80 gear when we roll out the stat-system changes prior to Cataclysm’s release. However, Mastery will begin appearing on select quest and dungeon items. You will also gain a small amount of Mastery by wearing gear of your intended armor type (such as plate for paladins). For players with dual specs, when you change between your two chosen specs, the Mastery bonuses and the benefit you receive from the Mastery stat on gear will adjust automatically based on your new spec.<br />
<br />
We’ll have more details to share about these and other changes we’re making in Cataclysm in the future, and we’ll do our best to answer your questions about the Mastery system here on the forums.

<br />
You get mastery from ALL the trees you put points into.<br />
<br />
So if you go 51/25 you get 51 points counting towards the first mastery, and 25 counting towards the second. If anything, I think this makes hybrid builds more likely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something better would be an increase to km procs with more mastery or bonus to frost strike base damage that scaled with mastery, or even a chance to generate an extra attack with more mastery</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see that happening for some talent trees (Feral, Beast Master, Demo, all three Paladin trees) will likely be like 70 points with one or two tagged into the start skills of other trees.<br />
<br />
I think there will be a new level of mastery of the system too understanding where to put your points at what levels of mastery on your gear to balance out good talents VS mastery bonus.<br />
<br />
AkA Having to respec each upgrade...</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The first bonus will increase your damage, healing, or survivability, depending on the intended role of the tree&quot;<br />
<br />
Is fine but it'd be hard to balance say a prot warrior with an x% reduced damage taken mastery versus a frost dk tank from the example with an x% increased dmg done one.<br />
<br />
They could tie more of it into stance/bearform/whatever like they are doing with crit immunity but that'd mess with pvp to no end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I highly doubt it, considering they are really pushing for the healing-dps split ever since. Although, I wonder if for PvP, spending a few talents in Resto would be any more beneficial for Ferals due to Mastery.<br />
<br />
We will more likely see bonuses like:<br />
+melee damage<br />
+dodge<br />
+crit/haste<br />
<br />
And please, please, redo Heart of the Wild. It is a very outdated talent that is half-useless and half-awesome, but please, remove the INT bonus from it. It just screams INCONSISTENT.</div></div><hr />

If you can fit three of &lt;filler spell&gt; in between each of your &lt;insert cool spell here&gt; instead of your usual two, it qualifies as a rotation change, no matter how trivial. It's possible they have something planned for Frost Mage that will make Frostbolt filler, you know, and it's an example that applies to other classes (think SPriests and fitting Mind Flays between Mind Blasts, or Surv Hunters fitting Steady Shots between Explosive Shots). Don't focus on the literal to make them look stupid. :)</div></div><hr />

Also, the fact that it's going to start showing up on gear makes it seem like Cata will be coming somewhat 'soon' or am I mistaken?</div></div><hr />

I am very curious to see how this all pans out. It will be really nice to not have to always chose certain talents and have more flexibility within the trees.</div></div><hr />

to hybrids like druids. I am assuming balance mastery will focus on<br />
+damage, Resto on +healing and feral on +AP. Since spellpower as we know it<br />
will be going away, I think it will make hybrids a bit less flexible.<br />
I don't think my moonkin will be able to crit a healing touch as big as<br />
a starfire by the looks of this. Spellpower always applied equally to<br />
everything in the spellbook, but I think mastery is going to greatly change<br />
which spells benefit based on the tree with which they are associated.<br />
The implications of that weigh more on PvP than PvE. I don't PvP, so I don't<br />
care. I do think it might temper some of the complaints people have about<br />
hybrids like Paladins and Druids being able to deal significant damage and heal<br />
themselves in a DPS spec and kit. While as a moonkin I shift out and still cast a heal<br />
it isn't going to benefit from the same +SP that all my DPS spells enjoy at the moment.</div></div><hr />

Blizz definitely needs to find a balance with them; I'm still looking forward to some interesting effects on the talent trees and possible shifts in dps specs. Seeing talents change is basically my favorite part of an expansion, along with the new spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. One of biggest reasons why WoW is so popular is the fact they keep chaning and tweaking all the time. Other MMO out there are/were much more stagnant. I'm now on yet another break from WoW but I know I will be back at least to try Cataclysm. With other games it would probably be over for good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It took them ages to get ArP right, and I'm not sure they ever actually did, so I'm not very optimistic. They learn from their mistakes, though.<br />

This is definitely what I'm the most curious about. If they want to remove stuff like passive +healing or +damage talents, how are they going to come up with enough gameplay changing mechanics for three trees per class?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It looks like total number of variables is being reduced, but they're working hard on a system where different stats combine together in a non-linear fashion, making talent, gear and (perhaps) rotation choices far from cookie-cutter paradigm we have now. New skills and tier bonuses will add a further layer as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, when you compare the disc vs holy talents, you get 2/3 of the same bonuses either way. Not to mention, bigger shields is still useful for holy and HoTs off direct heals are still useful for disc. I could definitely foresee some situations where the mastery bonus of one tree outweighs the the gain via talents of a different tree but that's reliant on there being 76 strong talents in a certain tree, so subspecs will still exist.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet the mastery talent for blood will be a passive ArP increase of some kind, whereas the unholy would be either a disease coefficient or an increase in magic damage (I honestly couldn't think of a good one for unholy, those sound kind of silly).<br />
<br />
Additionally, I don't see how they're going to implement the difference between tanking and dpsing in the same tree. It was announced that mastery bonuses would be tied to presences/forms but we don't know how yet.</div></div><hr />

Do you honestly believe that (to use your example of an Enh shaman) someone wouldn't spend 16 talent points in Ele to get large boosts to fire totem damage, double Maelstrom Weapon crit damage, and 9% melee crit just because it would translate to 1% lost melee damage over spending those talent points on irrelevant crap in the Enh tree?</div></div><hr />

I believe melee haste only affects, well, melee attacks.<br />
Haste rating will increase Runic regen (and other stuff, depending on the class) in addition to melee attacks. Kind of like how crit rating currently only affects your chance to crit, but Agility, for Rogues/Hunters, increase AP in addition to chance to crit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is actually the plan. Doing blizzcon Blizz stated that there would be a cap or diminishing return on how many mastery points you would get from dropping all points in this. My guess is they will either cap or slow down the points at 51 points. Since for most 51 points is needed in 1 tree.<br />
<br />
Now obvious the main problems atm is as others have said how they will make this work for hybrids and specs that do 2 things (Dks and Feral). But the hybrid bit could easly be solved simple by the fact Blizz want a hybrid dps to be slightly lower than a real dps, and if a hybrid then lose out on an dps increase from having to go into another tree that dont provide dps increases for them, well then they just get some of their lower dps right there. <br />
<br />
I personally cant wait to see what happens with our talents, what we get of new fun tools to play with and what talents are seperated into 2 talents, as im sure there will be several of the talents that currently provide 3-4 effects in 1. <br />
<br />
And while the possiblities for this system not being done currectly are huge due to the large amount of changes this effects, i for one have faith in Blizzard. Im sure it wont be perfect from the start but considering how long WoW have been around and how many of us are still playing it even now, i think we can all agree they must still know something about their game :P</div></div><hr />

I don't think &quot;interesting&quot; is what they're going for. &quot;Flavor of the spec&quot; is probably a more appropriate description for the third mastery bonus. Disc priests cast bubbles, that's their thing. Holy priests are raid healers, hots are great utility tools for raid healers (I don't see adding extra hots on direct heals being something that's very effective for druids but I wouldn't be surprised if the druid's third mastery bonus was hot related).<br />
<br />
I do wonder how they'll solve the issue of one-tree-only dps hybrids. That might create a &quot;all points in one tree&quot; issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I could very likely be completely wrong, but I recall hearing something (maybe just hand-waving) about certain talents in the spec determining the difference, i.e. taking tanking talents would possibly switch mastery bonuses around. Perhaps there'll be a talent in those trees to specifically do that, probably in addition to some tanking utility the talent provides.</div></div><hr />

Mastery makes sense now and it looks fun. We haven't seen the talent trees but with this change some speccs might be overpowered if not done right. As said in the post this will give players lots of choices between talents and how they want to play or what kind of rotation they want. But it will bring a negative thing aswell, &quot;noobs&quot; will now specc whatever they want and get away with it, as far as they keep pressing buttons :P <br />
<br />
Also about hybrids, eg. cats, will spend some points in resto tree to get much more powerful talents like omen of clarity, rather then choosing talents in feral tree and mastery giving a slight dmg increase. This will keep hybrids lower in dps then pure dps classes to compensate for the buffs and flexibility hybrids bring to raids.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking they could just make first few tiers of talents very general for hybrids - stat increases, crit/haste increases, those utility talents they want everyone to take could also be placed here.</div></div><hr />

Runic Power does not naturally fill without the use of RP-generating abilities, so haste rating will not increase its generation. Rather, haste will increase the rate at which runes refresh.<br />

This is interesting. I'm glad to see the Frost mastery bonuses revealed, as I almost exclusively play Frost right now. I do like the idea of adding melee haste through Mastery, because as mentioned in the blue post it would allow for trimming down some of the haste given by Icy Talons itself.<br />

That seems to kind of defeat the purpose of the reworked trees though. The idea is that you're now free to spend more points on fun and interesting talents instead of static dps, healing, EH increases, etc.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking the stances just change whatever it is mastery does for you. Frost presence gives you a health increase, Blood/unholy presence provide the damage increase, it's simple, and could potentially give tanks and dps too much ability to change roles without major gear/talent changes but it might work that way.<br />

ArP is being removed from gear. But there were blue posts stating ArP will remain elsewhere. I'm willing to bet the secondary passive bonus for blood, combat, arms, and maybe fury will be an ArP increase.</div></div><hr />

What? As far as I can tell from everything I've read, Mastery bonuses will be passive effects given for getting talents in a certain tree. They will not replace talents, they will be an added benefit for acquiring talents in each tree.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they said that Mastery would be a stat on gear. If you need more than hearsay, check the Cataclysm Stat and System Changes post they made about a week ago under &quot;Stats You'll See on Gear.&quot; http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=23425636414</div></div><hr />

The cooldowns on your abilities will likely be lowered. AKA, 10% haste takes 10% of the cooldown off divine storm (so it has a 9 second CD).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to those saying the &quot;76&quot; points in one tree thing. Well I think the exact opposite might happen, more hybrid specs. Since there might be diminishing returns near the bottom of the tree, and you'd still get mastery from other trees people will dump more points into other trees instead.<br />
<br />
But I like what Blizz is doing, they are adding alot of depth (if you think about it, theres alot of min/max potential here) while also simplifying it.<br />
<br />
I am curious as to how they'd do dk/feral tanks... Since their tanking trees are inside dps trees. Maybe stance/form would affect the bonuses you get from Mastery or Mastery could just add &quot;increases dmg/healing/dmg reduction by x%&quot; that way hybrids would gain more benefit. (if this is the case all a dk dps has to do is switch to frost pres, and he can tank. too much to hope for?)<br />

<br />
Yes, but the amount of mastery bonuses you would get from each of these is tied to the number of points you spend directly in a tree. So 1 point in a separate tree results in a really small mastery bonus from that tree.<br />

As you suspect, the bonus from a 1/1/1 would be far inferior to any other build due to the way mastery scaling occurs</div></div><hr />

<br />
3 Tiers of Mastery bonuses for each talent tree<br />
<br />
1st Tier: Core mechanic tied to the specific role (Healing, Damage, Mitigation)<br />
2nd Tier: Favored Stat for the specific spec (Crit, Haste, Armor Penetration, Mana reg, Stamina)<br />
3rd Tier: Unique, iconic and tied to the core niche of the spec (Improved HoTs/DoTs, Improved Spell Absorbs, Increased Crit damage, Reduced Cooldowns, Improved Poisons, Improved Blocks, ...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example holy pala's I'd guess the mastery stat would be some form of healing bonus and that retris would be some form of crit bonus on casts/spells.<br />
<br />
As such when u originally hit 85 u maybe need more of the retri spec to keep crit high and thus get more mana back (blizz have already pretty much guarenteed a rape to our endless mana - and rightly so).<br />
<br />
But as you get higher gear and higher stats off it you won't need the crit anymore so can dive further into holy for some massively high healing or into prot for some form of damage mitigation for raid (how I imagine prot mastery stat). <br />
<br />
I could be way off - but either the possibilities are far more exciting than when wotlk arrived.<br />

I do worry for some crazy pvp specs tho (for instance the old OP prot holy spec) if blizzard don't keep a close eye on the possible hybridization.<br />
<br />
To stormgust: I really hope you are wrong on the pala HoT. If they do give us a decent hot (and the current flash the shieldy hot is crap) they will be slowly giving all classes all forms of spells which blizzard said they were trying to steer away from. Ergo I rolled pala not tree / priest. :)</div></div><hr />

Well im an arcane mage - i dont care much about crit but haste is important for me.. And bosses will be harder to hit/crit - but haste always stays the same as far as i know.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vangor</div><div class="date">2010-03-09, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think there is a significant flaw in granting a passive, basic bonus to the trees in order to remove filler talents, namely what others have mentioned with hybrids having very narrow specs. From the examples given, an SPriest will want all 76 talents into Shadow to gain the Increase Damage by X% benefit unless too many talents make this pointless. As a DK this means my damage will be balanced around all three trees possessing passive damage bonuses, and considering Frost has nothing explicitly for tanking I expect to see what Prot Wars/Pals have incorporated as part of their mastery's incorporated into the talents or presence itself.<br />
<br />
Seems a tad pointless by needing to make a great deal of assumptions. DKs are an odd case, but Wars and Priests also have problems with two DPS or two Heal specs, and unless the idea is to strictly bloat a tree both will pretty much be balanced around X and Y amounts of the basic bonuses and Z for the specific ones. Seems the only significant difference will be, as usual, the talents themselves, which those basic bonuses change nothing for realistically, and the specific bonus which would be simpler to control and build around.<br />
<br />
Not to say I am not excited to see how one might hybridize, but I think they are creating more work for themselves while hindering a few set ups. The flat bonuses should be incorporated into a strict stance system for each class, I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That pretty much sums up my problems with the new system. They should cap the bonuses at say 51 talent points. This way you are not forced to pump all your talent points into one tree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I see as a problem for some trees but not others. For instance, a dps warrior can spec either arms or fury, but then go subspec into the other dps tree and still get the same damage boost (and maybe trade arp for crit or something). A class like a shadow priest runs into a different problem, there's no other dps subspec to go into, how that gets solved will be the interesting part (or, who knows, maybe shadow priest spend the majority of their points into shadow and are just balanced as such). That suggestion doesn't fit well into the &quot;more options about where you spend your talents&quot; issue though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They did delete spirit. Then they made a new regen stat called &quot;regen&quot; and made that the regen stat for all healers. <br />
Then they decided that &quot;spirit&quot; was a much more cool name. <br />
<br />
How the new spirit works, nobody yet knows. The FSR is gone. Instead we have while in combat and while not in combat regen. Meditation-like talents are gone. Apparently replaced with masteries for priests, probably something similar for other healers. But just how the stat pans out, is yet to be seen. I hope the formula is a bit simpler to be honest. And I hope it's decisively better than intellect in terms of regen. Otherwise, what is the point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because if you would need to put ALL your tlent points into it to get maximum benefit, then it again takes away your freedom of choice of getting talents for just for fun.<br />
<br />
Looking from the POV of a tank, the more points I put into my prot tree the more survival (armor? block?), desirable stat (armor? stamina?) I get and some usefull stuff that helps me tanking (reduced CD on defensive abilities? more threat?).<br />
This is all nice and dandy, but especialy if they go the way of more threat then the dps gap between a tank and a dps will be even bigger. And they stated the contrary that they would like to have the dps of tanks and dedicated dps closer to each other 1:2-1:3 instead of 1:5-1:6 as it is now.<br />
<br />
So that's why I hope mastery gets caped, because as a tank I would like to dip into the other trees to get a bit more damage and fun talents.<br />
<br />
Will be hard to make it right for Feral Druids and Death Knights.<br />
I could imagine, that bear form and kitty form will interpret your Feral Combat mastery differently (say if you are kitty it gives more dmg, if you are bear then more armor).<br />
But DKs either will need 1 dedicated tanking tree (which I find highly unlikely) or there again Frost Presence interprets Mastery in trees in different way or it grants OP abilities, which will make DKs in PVP imballanced yet again.</div></div><hr />

Yeah.. <br />

Also this makes certain dps classes more viable instead of having a spec to trumph them all like MM for hunters<br />

The mastery changes will definitely make ele shamans more viable as well..<br />

I'm also interest to see how these changes work out for dks more specifically tanking ones :O <br />

One of biggest reasons why WoW is so popular is the fact they keep chaning and tweaking all the time. Other MMO out there are/were much more stagnant. I'm now on yet another break from WoW but I know I will be back at least to try Cataclysm. With other games it would probably be over for good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well other RPG games like the original Asheron's Call were far far better than things are handled in wow. For example the Whole contents changed each month, depending on time of the year, snow, green, dry, leaves ... each MONTH there was a content patch with new dungeons, new areas and nothing was announced ahead of time so you actually had to go around and talk to npc's to get clues to what was going on. And you could actualyl influence the game by your actions, like level up monsters if they kill you, etc ... eventually a friend of mine leveled up a crystal that the bad guys neeeded to destroy so much that it became impossible to do :D especially with hundereds of players defending.<br />
<br />
Wow is past its best time patch wise ... in the start we got many many updated in clsoe time while now it seems to be ok to get expansion end game content by patch 3 :D Gl with next expansion :D</div></div><hr />

There will be 30 different bonuses which will benefit from Mastery.<br />
<br />
So we have choices now like do we want the maximum benefit from one tree or a bit from this and a bit from that.<br />
Each class will have the choice of 3 bonuses to benefit from.<br />
<br />
I think we'll be doing a lot of thinking in spending point in trees then just check some sheet or examples provided.<br />
I don't think that there will be something like &quot;THE BEST SET OF TALENTS&quot; for any char in any role.<br />
<br />
I'm not posting very long here, nor am I reading very long here......<br />
But still my impression at this moment is that wow-players lost the touch with the fun the game should bring.<br />
It is all about maxing out dps, healing or defense and stuff for tanks..... using sheets others created, expecting them to max out the output of a char in a certain role.<br />
<br />
I'm just concerned with maxing out the fun I have playing this awesome game. :)<br />
<br />
Blizzard just entered a feature that should give players a chance to have a go at having fun without others telling you that you're not doing enough dps or something of this nature. I hope this works out that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The mastery system in its current state seems flawed. I don't see how putting all your points into one tree is suppossed to be fun, at least as a hybrid like a Paladin or Druids. If it's capped or affected by diminished return, I can see a new wave of balance problems with hybrids. Assuming Mastery is capped at e.g. 50/51 points, certain healing/damage classes are balanced around what else they have to pick up from another tree to support their role, while other classes (e.g. Paladins) must be balanced around their primary tree while picking up &quot;free&quot; extra utility from other trees.<br />
<br />
There could also be a scaling problem of the third Mastery boni between specs/classes. E.g. the shown boni of Priests no problems in terms of scaling while Rets with their currently known CD reduction are restricted to certain Mastery caps due to being GCD-locked.<br />
<br />
I'm interested to see what happens to the talent trees, too, especially the skeleton that is called Retribution. It currently has only 66 talent points to spend and many talents should be gone with their current plans: <br />
<br />
Deflection, Benediction, Improved Blessing of Might, Conviction, Sanctity of Battle, Crusade, Two-Hand Weapon Specialization = 26 points gone (Swift and Sanctified Retribution are debateable due to buffing the raid, but they are also horribly boring +% talents)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Has anyone thought this may be intentional? To keep hybrid damage below pure dps damage. This was always stated to be the plan, and there has been times in Wotlk where hybrids have been really close on the meters.<br />
<br />
I genuinely think that this is intentional. Hybrids who dip into other trees lose a bit of DPS for the extra utility they bring. I think the aim for Cata is probably:<br />
<br />
Top Dps - pure classes<br />
2nd - Hybrids who spec almost exclusively in dps tree (boomkins, Spriests (won't need disc talents so much if they get meditation and other passive bonuses))<br />
3rd - Hybrids who spec in different trees.<br />
<br />
Substituting Dps for utility. I think this has always been Blizzards aim for hybrids, and this seems like a good way for them to do it.</div></div><hr />

People have said things along the lines of &quot;X class doesn't have enough useful talents to use 72 points in 1 tree&quot; even though they actually have no clue about what will be added to the trees and what will be removed.<br />
<br />
At this stage, there is simply nowhere near enough information to draw any sort of useful conclusions as to what these changes will mean once Cataclysm hits, and even if there was, the pointless, poorly thought out conjecture that people are spouting would be entirely inadequate when it comes to actually working out the benefits/drawbacks to any class/spec combination.<br />
<br />
In my opinion, people need to chill- unless you can actually provide solid numbers and theorycrafting to prove specific points, you have little to no sway over what the developers do so at this stage, you may as well wait and see how it plays out. I think that it could be fairly interesting, in fact, especially considering that it seems much simpler than the old system so class balance, theoretically, should be much better under this system.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have solid numbers and theorycrafting backing up my QQ. The theorycraft goes like this: Game design is hard. Percentage of times in the history of MMOs and their MUD predecessors that any developer has ever made a giant change to class mechanics and balance and pulled it off without screwing 1 or more classes completely and taking ages to fix them: 0%. Prediction for Cata: one or more classes will get screwed.</div></div><hr />

You sure you are looking at the same talent-tree as the dev? They have already stated that they are reworking all talenttrees. His statement could very well be based off the prototype Cataclysm talenttree while you are looking at the live one.</div></div><hr />

That means Blizzard hasn't yet done anything bad enough to this game since release to cause you to quit for good, so chances are they aren't going to. It would also do well to remember that this game is their biggest, most profitable product and that any change made is going to be scrutinized beyond what you can probably even imagine. Their profits are public information, go look that stuff up. Do you really think they would let the developers do anything to make those numbers go anywhere but up? Even if, for some reason, they did manage to screw it up, you and I have the right to stop paying them for their product until they can get it fixed.<br />
<br />
I have confidence that they will do great things for the game's future. Since we don't even have all of the information about the Cataclysm changes yet, it's sort of silly to whine concerns at each other just yet. It's already been said that we don't know what the new talent trees are going to look like, so try to not get bent out of shape over your hybrid specs and mastery bonuses, since even what they have provided here is almost sure to change drastically before the expansion even launches. <br />
<br />
Take a breath, it will be okay.</div></div><hr />

Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. I can only assume that there's either been mass amnesia or most of the people in these threads weren't around when Wrath was at this point. A surprising amount of what is being said by the devs today is just a recycle of Wrath design goals or, even better, efforts to undo some of what they did with Wrath (but now likely can't undo).<br />
<br />
<br />
The mastery system in its current state seems flawed.<br />
<br />
It seems like a recipe for another two years of laughable &quot;balance&quot;. Hey, they can't get this system even close to balanced, so let's completely change the stat system, and while we're at it we'll add three new stats to every tree just to make things really screwy.<br />
<br />
People had better hope the mastery system turns out to be as boring and pointless as Glyphs (Woooo! So many choices! Fortunately most of them sucking, and the ones that don't mostly being surrogate talent points, makes them easy to balance), otherwise FoTM is going to take on a whole new level of meaning as players find new and interesting ways to abuse what sounds today to be an imminently abusable system.</div></div><hr />

Masteries will also change depending on stance/bear form/presence/righteous fury, and these abilities will put you at defense cap so you do not need to be tank spec to tank dungeons and heroics, raids will still require a fully tank specced tank.</div></div><hr />

So you are telling me that there is no rogue ability that reduces the chance to be detected while stealthed &lt;Master of Deception...first tier of Subtlety Tree&gt;? So he said the wrong ability, it doesn't mean Bliz has no clue what they are doing. Yes there is a talent that you can spec into which does exactly what he was quoted as saying, he just used the wrong name. Just because he made a small mistake doesn't mean Blizzard as a whole doesn't have any idea what they are doing. I'm certain if I went over everything you've ever written I would find a mistake or two, would that then imply that everyone that you are associated with is a moron because you said something that was not correct?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-03-09, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I feel kinda bad for posting in ignorance, but I can't see the official forums from work (but I can read and post on mmo-champion all day. Yay?). I'm with several others here, on being a bit concerned about Hybrids. I'll use my Rogue and my Druid (since I know their mechanics better than any other classes) as examples.<br />
<br />
For my Rogue, I currently put points in Combat and Assassination. Likely I will continue to do so. First level mastery in both is likely to be +DPS, so no loss by putting points in both. Second level is likely to be +haste for Assassination, and +ArP for Combat, both will be helpful, so sure no problem. Third level for Assassination seems likely to be poison related, and I don't know what Combat will be. Since poisons are good for Combat, I'll make a reasonable guess that the Assassination third tier mastery will be helpful for Combat Rogues. All is well, there is no reason to assume that I'll be penalized much for a multi-tree spec. <br />
<br />
For my Druid (I'll use my tank spec, since it seems like the more likely problem), I currently spend most of my &quot;off&quot; points in the Resto tree. There are several useful talents for bear tanks in the Resto tree, so this makes sense. So... um.. I get + healing Masteries? For my tank? That can't heal in bear form, even if I could find a GCD or two to throw a heal on someone? I will grant you that I'm not looking at the new talent trees. Maybe they'll remove all the yummy things like Master Shape Shifter out of Resto, but I can't see any possible way that any Mastery from Balance or Resto would ever be useful to a Feral. Ferals don't heal (and they can't without form shifts, so it can't even be a &quot;utility&quot; function), and don't use spell damage (and they can't without shifting so it can't even be a &quot;utility&quot; thing). The second tier bonus (probably +crit in both cases) from the other trees might be useful, but I can't see any way that the first and third tier bonuses would be. <br />
<br />
Edit to add: I'm not QQing here. Just curious about how they plan to handle this. I'm sure they've thought of it, but I see no indication of what they expect to do. I mean a 76 point Feral only spec will look mighty silly, and won't exactly make &quot;more interesting choices&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a blue post that mentioned that almost all the current first 2 tiers of talents for Subtlety may all become class passives :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sylvor</div><div class="date">2010-03-09, 03:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the mastery system has a lot of potential. Once implemented the game designers will have easier nobs to turn to increase damage, healing, tanking etc. to balance the game easier. This will give them a universal nob for specs in a class. <br />
<br />
Removing many of the passive talents and rolling their effects into the mastery will also hopefully bring in a few more talents and play styles. I use to play a warrior. I think it would be nice to have a few ways to go down the fury or arms tree and reach about the same amount of while having a few mechanics you can change up. <br />
<br />
As for hybrids, I think they may potentially lose out a bit on being able to do that second job, however I do not see why this is such a big deal. You still will be able to do some healing.<br />
<br />
Overall, this should hopefully give bliz another nob to turn for balancing the game quickly. They can look at a spec that is doing too much damage, and turn the mastery down a bit. Then they can look into the tree itself and nerf/buff the individual ability that is doing too much damage. <br />
<br />
Overall, for the player, I think the biggest change will be having more buttons to potentially press, or being able to vary which buttons you press.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-03-09, 03:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">a) I never said that all classes would come out of it well. I said that there is no evidence to suggest that specifically &quot;Class X&quot; will get a nerf. And as it stands, classes such s Boomkins are already sub-par in terms of balance so the argument that 'a class will come off badly' holds absolutely no water as not all classes are fine as it stands- It's a fact that the ratio of classes which are working as intended to those that are not will either stay the same, increase or decrease- 1 of those is positive, 1 is negligible and as such would cause no QQ either way (so you could say that that's also positive if the stat and talent systems are simplified) and 1 is negative; 2 (essentially) positive outcomes to 1 negative one immediately suggests that this is likely to be a good change rather than a bad one.<br />
I think you're misunderstanding the nature of QQ. You're making the assumption that people are happy with the status quo, which, as far as the current attitude of humanity is concerned, is not the case. <br />
In short: the '1 is negligible' will cause QQ because it is negligible. QQ does not care about logic.<br />
<br />
<br />
b) That's not theorycrafting. That's more QQ, conjecture and an irrelevant (not to mention untrue) argument from experience with the word 'theorycrafting' behind it to convince stupid people that it actually is theorycrafting. Don't attempt to disguise one thing as another when it blatantly isn't. That's not an argument, it's a lie. Essentially, you've said that '1 or more classes will get screwed' without saying that 'one or more classes could be improved'- You've essentially provided a one-sided argument with nothing to back it up.<br />
<br />
You, sir, are the Fox news of MMO Champion.<br />
While it may be a Fox News style comment the version of any class balancing change that hits live servers is very likely to have a large bug in it somewhere for the following reasons:<br />
1. The people making the change are human beings, and are not perfect.<br />
2. The change was not tested by an infinite number of testers.<br />
3. In the case of WoW there will be roughly 1.1 million or more people (1/10th of the game population) trying to break the change when it's applied.<br />
It's extremely likely that there will be a large imbalance somewhere, and it will take a long time to get it right no matter how long blizzard takes to test it or how many testers they have. This is the nature of video games.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit<br />
<br />
I should also point out that changes which tend to mess class balance up and make balancing take ages to carry out are those which tend to increase the complexity of the systems used; This is all about reducing complexity and should, in theory, actually make class balance much, much easier.<br />
In theory, yes, but the mastery system is more than likely going to make things more complex because people can spec into multiple talent trees for multiple bonuses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's fine, but the guy was just trying to point out an example of a talent that felt a little useless that with the new mastery system wouldn't feel quite so useless since you would see some type of stat increase just by putting points in the talent. No need to nitpick and call Bliz stupid because he stated the wrong name of the ability for his example.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pfunkmort</div><div class="date">2010-03-09, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">look...no. (I'm not going to bother reading the 135 comments above me, but I'm responding to the blizzard logic that justifies the awesomeness of masteries - even though I don't necessarily disagree with them as a game mechanic). If you're giving x quantifiable bonus for having y amount of points spent in one specific tree, you're still making taking talents mandatory. If I take *be a noob* (&lt;--talent name) which doesn't increase my dps and is completely uninteresting in my main dps tree, but it gives me a net bonus to my mastery, which is then higher than what I would get from putting a spread talent in a second tree, that point becomes mandatory. and if it's not higher, the spread talent becomes mandatory. &quot;bis&quot; specs will still exist. the only difference is that the justifications will become a little more esoteric. It will read like this &quot;taking the base dps talents in the assassination tree (for example) are necessary to boost dps, but your overall dps increase from going into combat are best used here here and here. Now, for your last 2 points, you can either go with these minor dps increases in combat, or you can sink them into assassination, and get a greater and more relevant mastery bonus from assass. 1 is better or 2 is better. period.&quot; It's still going to be cut and dry - it's just going to have to take mastery into account. <br />
<br />
This nonsense of &quot;oh no, now it's more interesting&quot; is complete SH*T - from a min/maxxer's perspective. The conversation doesn't change, you're just making it more gimmicky.</div></div><hr />

Any talents that show up low in a resto tree right now that seem like they would be good for a tank would be moved to the caster tree. <br />

low level caster mastery could be simple + damage buff that a tank would benefit from <br />

<br />
1. It was said that there will be a sort of &quot;diminishing returns&quot; on masteries, to prevent bloating one tree.<br />
<br />
2. Hybrid classes will likely get shuffled a little bit to fix the issue with incompatible talents/masteries (i.e., bears getting healing bonuses for the resto talents that are &quot;mandatory&quot;)<br />
<br />
3. Yes, he made a mistake. Elusiveness the talent does not increase stealth level, at least not in live. Get over it. If he loses credibility for making a mistake, perhaps everyone here should lose credibility for spelling/grammar errors?<br />
<br />
4. The mastery bonus from wearing the correct armor class won't make/break the class. It will likely just make the decision to wear a lower level of gear less trivial. <br />
<br />
To me it seems like the masteries will boost damage A LOT. I saw +72% damage on the combat/retribution trees. I wonder what that will translate to after the &quot;bloat&quot; talents are removed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daegalus</div><div class="date">2010-03-09, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">After reading the post a few times, I gathered that you get all 3 bonuses even with 1 point in, but at different scaling. Example:<br />
(these are rough and made up but its just to get the point across)<br />
<br />
26/50 Holy Priest<br />
Holy Tree:<br />
Healing - Increases your healing by 53%<br />
Meditation - Increases your mana regen from Spirit in combat by 53%<br />
Radiance - Adds a Hot Component that heals 53% of the main heal over time.<br />
<br />
Discipline Tree:<br />
Healing - Increases your healing by 18%<br />
Meditation - Increases your mana regen from Spirit in combat by 18%<br />
Absorption - Increases dmg absorbed by PW:S by 18%<br />
<br />
VS.<br />
<br />
50/26 Disc Priests<br />
Holy Tree:<br />
Healing: 18% Increase<br />
Meditation: 18% mana regen increases from Spirit<br />
Radiance: 18% of the Heal will be done as a HoT<br />
<br />
Discipline Tree:<br />
Healing: 53% Increase<br />
Meditation: 53% Increase<br />
Absorption: 53% more dmg absorbed by PW:S<br />
<br />
Now the numbers will scale differently and it won't be so linear, so for example 26 points will only equate to 15% bonus, or something. This way, subspecing doesn't harm you very much versus going full 76 points into a tree. ya 76% healing increase is nice, but 65% increases plus a 15% radiance might turn out better healing in end game. Same goes for the Mediatation mastery. I'll re-read the post but from the way it was worded, this is how I see it working. Also, they don't have to be necessarily the same scaling. For example you could probably get 22% healing if you put 26 points into Holy and only 13% healing by putting points into Disc, or vice versa. It will probably be scaled based on the way the spec works and the talents you get in the tree.<br />
<br />
So I don't think going full 76 points into a tree would be as beneficial as going say 51/25 or something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That isn't really what concerns me. Move the talents out of Resto to... Where? There is no (sensible) Mastery bonus for either non-feral tree that makes sense for Ferals. Sensible first tier mastery bonuses for Resto is + healing; for balance it's + Spell Damage. Neither is useful for Feral. Sensible second tier bonuses are OK. Probably + crit or + haste, those ferals can use somewhat (though haste is meh as it is now, it will probably be more useful in Cataclysm). Third tiers are again almost certain to be &quot;spell&quot; related for both trees (since they're casters). It's not that the Mastery for resto is likely to bad for feral, it's that the Masteries for any other tree are likely to be. Which puts us either putting 76 points in the feral tree (likely taking every single talent regardless of usefulness), or putting point into trees with completely pointless Mastery bonuses. <br />
<br />
I'm sure there's a twist I'm missing or some not yet released bit of information that answers this. I don't think Blizzard has failed to note it. Shadow Priests are likely to have the same problem, as are Holy Pallies. I just don't think it will be as simple as &quot;reshuffling&quot; the talents though. There are simply no better places to put the talents in question.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind, the talents like Naturalist and Master Shapeshifter are the ones they are trying to get rid of (i.e. talents that just give a straight up +% damage), ergo (possibly) making putting points in Resto, well, pointless.<br />
<br />
I know what you're saying, but it's all stuff that they're aware of and are working to fix.<br />
<br />
One of the suggestions that many people have made is having the masteries get adjusted depending on stance/form/presence/etc. So for example, points in Resto in caster/tree form provide +healing, but in Bear form provides damage reductions, or something of the like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet there have been times when Blizzard cannot predict. So it's not without merit to cry wolf at the first sign of a problem.<br />
<br />
It sounds like their trying to fight cookie cutter builds and allow people more individuality, but I wager that's a futile gesture thanks to websites like this, WH, and EJ. People will do the math and calculate the best results, and the mass's will follow. I really hope blizzard uses mastery to weight down the roles and segregate everyone. I guess I'm just sick of blizzard always trying to make everyone good at every roll and dumbing down the game to the lowest braincell. All too early to tell.</div></div><hr />

Last time I checked this was a forum where people can say how they feel. <br />
<br />
Some will disagree and add some additional information / quotes that will prove / disprove these points. That's the fun and interesting thing about forums.<br />
<br />
Of course you will get the odd idiot or too but if hearing people discuss &quot;potential changes&quot; (hence it's all theory and this theorycrafting) log off lol and save us the I hate blizz crap.<br />

This. <br />
<br />
Blizz has been very quick in fixing things this expac and I'm hoping this will continue with cata. If something doesn't work, they will fix it.<br />
<br />
As for people saying classes won't be balanced after mastery comes out. Yes, they won't be balanced. They won't balanced no matter what you do. They will NEVER be balanced. There will always be some class that will stay slightly better at something then others. But it won't be so big that class will be broken. If some class is behind others, they can always change the mastery bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think mastery would be the ultimate band-aid balance fix.<br />
<br />
X class is doing Y% more damage than anyone else? Reduce their damage mastery by Y%.<br />
<br />
X Tank is taking Y% more damage than other tanks? Increase damage reduction by Y%<br />
<br />
It's overall a pretty lame way to do it, but effective.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arandmoor</div><div class="date">2010-03-09, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is actually the plan. Doing blizzcon Blizz stated that there would be a cap or diminishing return on how many mastery points you would get from dropping all points in this. My guess is they will either cap or slow down the points at 51 points. Since for most 51 points is needed in 1 tree.<br />
<br />
Now obvious the main problems atm is as others have said how they will make this work for hybrids and specs that do 2 things (Dks and Feral). But the hybrid bit could easly be solved simple by the fact Blizz want a hybrid dps to be slightly lower than a real dps, and if a hybrid then lose out on an dps increase from having to go into another tree that dont provide dps increases for them, well then they just get some of their lower dps right there. <br />
<br />
I personally cant wait to see what happens with our talents, what we get of new fun tools to play with and what talents are seperated into 2 talents, as im sure there will be several of the talents that currently provide 3-4 effects in 1. <br />
<br />
And while the possiblities for this system not being done currectly are huge due to the large amount of changes this effects, i for one have faith in Blizzard. Im sure it wont be perfect from the start but considering how long WoW have been around and how many of us are still playing it even now, i think we can all agree they must still know something about their game :P<br />
<br />
<br />
This.<br />
<br />
There's a problem right now with pure DPS classes being overshadowed a bit too much (IMO) by hybrid classes.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way: When you roll a hybrid class, you should be doing it so that you have access to multiple types of abilities and can diversify your playstyle. This diversity (or flexibility if you prefer) is the primary draw of a hybrid. The ability to do multiple kinds of things without respeccing or rolling a different class.<br />
<br />
When you roll a pure class, you give up this diversity and balance (hell, logic) dictates that there needs to be some sort of trade-off. In Wrath there hasn't been one. Hybrid DPSers have been putting out as much if not more DPS than many pures, while bringing the diversity of a non-pure class.<br />
<br />
From the perspective of hybrid players, this isn't a problem.<br />
From the perspective of pure players, it's the end of the world.<br />
From the perspective of someone with a LOT of 80s who has raiding experience on all of them it's not the end of the world, but it is a problem.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of the mastery system because it will put a bit tuning nob on the various classes that the devs can turn to balance classes against one another. I also like it because it will, by it's nature, give a slight DPS advantage to some of the pure DPS classes over some of the hybrids.<br />
<br />
Ret paladins won't be able to stack pure DPS masteries and will be forced to pump their survivability or healing once they cap their ret talents. There will be QQ.<br />
<br />
Elemental and Enhancement Shamans that sub resto will enhance their healing. Some will embrace this and pop off the occasional heal when it would be useful to their raid. Many will QQ.<br />
<br />
Truth be told, when we see the release version of the mastery system we might have to agree on a new definition of the terms &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;hybrid&quot; to take talent point allocation into account because some classes will have the option to spec purely for DPS while others will be unable to do so.<br />
<br />
We will see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We will see.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've always felt there should be (and is) a difference between the classes with two roles and those with three (or four).<br />
<br />
For example - Warriors have three trees, but two specs. They are able to spec into a &quot;pure&quot; dps spec, by having two dps trees (there is no &quot;pure&quot; tanking spec, as there is only one tanking tree).<br />
<br />
Death knights could be &quot;pure&quot; dps or &quot;pure&quot; tank, since they have three of each trees, technically.<br />
<br />
Druids, Shaman (to a lesser extent) and Paladins are all kind of single-tree single-role classes (although druids have two specs in one tree with feral). Enhancement shaman, in their current form, could technically be &quot;pure&quot; dps, since enhancement uses spells that are enhanced by elemental talents.<br />
<br />
Priests are a bit of an oddity, since they have two healing trees and one dps tree, and are in the same boat as druids. Having a healing sub-tree isn't useful, since they would have to break form to throw a heal, unlike shaman and paladin.<br />
<br />
So what is there to do? Different names for difference classes of hybrids?<br />
<br />
e.g.<br />
<br />
&quot;Pure DPS&quot; - Hunter, Lock, Mage, Rogue<br />
&quot;Full Healer&quot; - Holy/Disc Priest<br />
&quot;Full DPS&quot; - Enhancement Shaman, Fury/Arms Warrior, any DK dps<br />
&quot;Hybrid&quot; - All druid, Elemental/Resto Shaman, all Paladin, Shadow Priest</div></div><hr />

Think we'll get some +hit from Mastery depending on spec? as a DW DPS I really don't want to stack hit exclusively from gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on earlier blue posts, hit will be on gear. Further, more hit will be needed as you scale raid content such that.... hit will continue to be on lots of gear. To give you an idea, Boomkins and Ele Shaman will share gear with their Resto counterparts. Gear with Spirit on it. The Boom/Ele's will have talents to convert Spirit to Hit. That's a lot of Spirit ;)<br />
<br />
As for these fun tools people get excited about, I'm wondering how often they'll really be used. You can probably have fun with them solo at times. Some might come in handy for pvp. Perhaps there will be some minor benefit in raids as well. Yet I'm wondering how useful these utilities will be in raids overall. Raid specs may end up, &quot;take these talents and drop another XX points into X tree. Specific talents don't really matter as nothing else will impact your raid performance.&quot; In the end, that doesn't really sound fun either. Anther possibility is that there's enough mandatory talents that we just continue to take all of those and still skip the utility talents.<br />
<br />
Now, this is all speculation. We won't know until we start seeing more examples of the talent trees. If implemented well, it shouldn't be a problem. If not? We could end up with lots of fodder points or still end up with none to spare. A small handful to spread around would probably suffice. Say, the additional 5 they're giving us?</div></div><hr />

In other words, the phrase &quot;Cookie Cutter Spec&quot; will be less of a presence when specing.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hybrid&quot; - All druid, Elemental/Resto Shaman, all Paladin, Shadow Priest<br />
<br />
<br />
Druids have always been an oddball even as hybrids go. They are theoretically the most versatile single class, able to effectively perform all 4 roles (tank, healer, melee DPS, or ranged DPS). Conversely they are probably the most limited of the hybrids, because to perform any of these roles well, they have to be in the correct form. The penalty for being out of form is less serious for the healing spec, more so for the two DPS specs, and largely insurmountable for the tank spec. A tanking Druid that switches out of form to perform any sort of utility spell may as well just wipe the raid, unless they are not currently tanking in a tank switch fight. DPS isn't so bad, you basically just lose some DPS time to form switches, in addition to the casting time of the spell. Healers can actually heal pretty effectively out of form, though the 5% bonus healing is nice. <br />
<br />
The form switching could give Blizz some extra tools to work with on Mastery Bonuses, but it could make the Druid Mastery stuff kind of confusing. <br />
<br />
&quot;So I get + healing from my resto tree points right?&quot;<br />
&quot;Yeah, but only in tree form.&quot;<br />
&quot;What about elf form?&quot;<br />
&quot;Uh, you get + melee damage?&quot;<br />
&quot;I thought that was only in cat form?&quot;<br />
&quot;Wait, what about bear form, that gets + melee damage too, right?&quot;<br />
&quot;I thought that was expertise?&quot;<br />
....<br />
<br />
It probably won't be that bad ::) but I can see it getting kinda messy if they go that route. Better than forcing us to spend all out points in one tree though. I guess we'll see.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isilbêth</div><div class="date">2010-03-09, 08:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it funny how even though this is just a small preview of a system which is still in development (i.e. unfinished) and Blizzard have already stated that the talent trees will also be changing in Cataclysm, people are still totally ready to definitively say &quot;This will gimp (Insert poster's class here)&quot; or vice versa, without actually having any idea what the talents will be, what the stats on gear will be, how stat coefficients will change or how this system will work in conjunction with Path of the Titans (something which we still know very little about. People have said things along the lines of &quot;X class doesn't have enough useful talents to use 72 points in 1 tree&quot; even though they actually have no clue about what will be added to the trees and what will be removed.<br />
<br />
At this stage, there is simply nowhere near enough information to draw any sort of useful conclusions as to what these changes will mean once Cataclysm hits, and even if there was, the pointless, poorly thought out conjecture that people are spouting would be entirely inadequate when it comes to actually working out the benefits/drawbacks to any class/spec combination.<br />
<br />
<br />
I totally agree with this opinion. I believe that the new system might be much more sophisticated and interesting than we can actually imagine by the combination of mastery with Path of the Titans, as Blizzard tries to refresh the game. But I also guess that his system will benefit to large guilds, who will have the capacity to specialize their members.</div></div><hr />

<br />
X class is doing Y% more damage than anyone else? Reduce their damage mastery by Y%.<br />
<br />
X Tank is taking Y% more damage than other tanks? Increase damage reduction by Y%<br />
<br />
It's overall a pretty lame way to do it, but effective.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is one of the best things they have gained by doing the mastery system. INstead of having to increase talents that might push them over there respective levels and into OPness, they can just increase/lower there mastery by a little bit.<br />
<br />
Also they said there will be disminishing returns on the points at blizzcon. So no, 76 points into one tree will not be that helpfull, on top of that I don't even think you can fit all 76 points into one tree to start with. A Mage might only gain +50% spell damage from doing 51 points into one tree when a shadow priest might gain +70% spell damage from putting it all in the shadow tree. However when that mage adds the rest of the points into one of hte other two trees, there total damage bonus might be +75-80% more spell damage.<br />
<br />
So yes, this might make 1 tree DPS classes like priests and paladins, or even some trees like elemental shamans more hybrid like. which will inturn piss off the pures. <br />
<br />
Note: THe reason why I say elemental shamans is since elemental shamans do not gain from +Melee damage, unlike how enhancement shamans can gain from the +spell damage from the elemental tree. So blizzard can balance enhancement on going off both trees but would have to do elemental as a standalone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plus, it is really too early to really do anything. We only know two priest trees, one death knight tree, the paladin and rogue trees. The Paladin and Rogue trees are subject to change thought since it might have difference bonuses from the blizzcon picture.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise ret paladins would have NO reason to go into any of the other trees. Now the drawback I'm seeing is that those bonuses for holy/prot are not going to increase our dps like they would for a DK in their example. Anyone who doesn't have 2 dps trees is probably going to have to have their single dps tree have some MAJOR bonuses... but then we're unbalanced again because we get all the offensive power of 2 (or 3) trees in one but would also get the defensive power of our other trees..<br />

How then, are these tank classes going to compare to Warrior and Paladin tanking masteries? If the masteries solely increased damage directly/indirectly then it would be safe to assume it's balanced. But... my guess is they won't do that. Percentage based tanking masteries are going to put DK's and Bears at a slight gimp. <br />

The third bonus on each tree look like they're from a set bonus. &quot;Your flash heals now have a 50% chance to put a HoT on your target&quot;, &quot;your PW:S can absorb 10% more damage&quot;, etc. Kinda feels like I've seen it all on gear / spec already.<br />
<br />
I'll wait until I see it in action though before I jump to conclusions, I'm hoping they've got a good reason for this, and it's not just change for changes sake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlock<br />
+Damage from mastery is reduced by 14%<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
+Healing from mastery is increased by 2%<br />
<br />
etc etc.<br />
<br />
Blizzard said that the intent is to do it that way, to have a &quot;Hunger for Blood&quot; talent for every spec of every class that they can easily change to balance things out. And while it makes things easier for them it makes it pretty boring for players.<br />
<br />
Also, i wonder if there is a bit of new information in 3.3.3 prepatch part.</div></div><hr />

I'm a bit confused as to where you want to be going with this whole concept. If it's to set a baseline for the &quot;hybrid tax&quot;, you seem to be misconstruing why the tax exists. It's not as much a &quot;payment&quot; for being able to do multiple jobs within the context of a single fight. It's a &quot;payment&quot; for being able to switch roles BETWEEN fights without gaining levels 2 through 80 a second time. Since everyone can dps, there is no &quot;pure&quot; healing or tanking class at all, so all healers and tanks are balanced toward an even keel without priests being better healers than druids because they can both dps but druids can't tank or anything like that. It would be a lot harder to balance the game around certain tanks or healers being better than others, while it's easier to balance dps around that because non-pure dps is more prevailent than pure dps simply because 3% less dps (if that, in the case of melee hybrids; caster hybrids pay 3%, or more like 10% for boomkins because Blizz seems to think if druids want to dps they should be feral) is a small price to pay to not be pigeonholed into one role forever.</div></div><hr />

I didn't mean to imply that I want disparity between the classes, I was just pointing out that the definition of &quot;hybrid&quot; has changed drastically since 2004, and indeed that &quot;hybrid&quot; in terms of Shaman is not the same as &quot;hybrid&quot; in terms of Druid.<br />
<br />
Back in the day, priest and warrior weren't considered &quot;hybrid&quot; (that I know of) because there were only heal/dps, or tank/dps. What I always understood to be the &quot;hybrid&quot; classes were the ones that fulfil ALL roles.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think a &quot;hybrid tax&quot; is necessary, but I do feel that a few percent doesn't matter, especially when you bring Bloodlust/Heroism, Rebirth, Hands of Salv/Protection/Freedom, innervate, etc. You could take 2 tanks, 5 healers and 17 Mutilate Rogues, but God I wouldn't want to be in that raid.<br />
<br />
More often than not, when one class whines that X class does Y% more damage than Z class, X class gets nerfed, Z class doesn't get buffed, I.E. net loss.<br />
<br />
<br />
So on the topic of masteries, sure if I'm a resto shaman, a few points in elemental won't increase my healing, but won't that 1 second off shock cooldown (for example) be great for helping out interrupts, making you a more effective ASSET, rather than just an effective healer? (probably terrible example, but I think you get the gist)<br />
<br />
You could relate the &quot;balance&quot; issues to a game like Modern Warfare, vs a game like MAG.<br />
<br />
In Modern Warfare, you can absolutely be a one man army, and take out entire teams by yourself, but in MAG the individual means diddly. You can't win anything without your squadmates at your side.<br />
<br />
If people in WoW would worry less about being a hero, and more about helping their fellow raid/party mates, I think the slight differences would matter less, and people would have more fun playing the game.<br />
<br />
On my main, I specced Demonology to bring Demonic Pact. Keep in mind, I've never played Demo AT ALL, and I've always hated it. Sure, I could do SLIGHTLY more overall damage as Affliction, but that difference is totally meaningless in the grand scheme of things, and my guild absolutely loves the 400+ spellpower buff they get. And to tell you the truth, I started to like Demo, and now I won't play anything else, except on specific encounters.<br />
<br />
TL/DR version: Quit thinking like a Diva.<br />
<br />

Again, not a QQ. I love my class. I have a lot of fun playing the game. I just wonder what tanking and healing are like and will never know because I can't stand old world questing all over again to find out.

<br />
Basically, for me, the whole &quot;what if&quot; scenario is what drives me nuts. What if I'd enjoy healing 3x as much as I enjoy dps? I'll never know! What if all I'd need to conquer burnout from time to time while waiting for a new tier would be to change roles for a while? I'll never know! Healers and tanks never have to wonder what it's like to dps; it's always just a respec away. Four classes will always just be wondering what it's like to do something OTHER than dps. And the reason that situation exists is that tanks and healers wanted to be heroes and Blizzard caved and let everyone dps equally. It sort of makes pures pointless. If I were starting the game up today, and I recommend this to anyone just now getting into WoW, I'd definitely roll a hybrid. There's no point being a pure, all you can do is one thing, and no better than the hybrids. Back when I chose mage it meant something. Now it just means giving up 2/3rds of the game from the first click.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, you're falling into the 0.0000000001% of players that actually WANT to do more than damage as a DPS class.<br />
<br />
You've always had the option of playing another class. Nothing forces you to max one toon to 80 before leveling another alt.<br />
<br />
When I first started I went through three classes to 10 before deciding on one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a hybrid class, you would be stuck in one tree. Let's say that's a DPS tree, and you've got most points spent in that tree, I think you would be able to focus all mastery points on that tree bonus whether you spend some points in another tree or not.</div></div><hr />

This way, if you choose a talent like Elusiveness (which reduces your chance to be detected while stealthed)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
this again shows, that blizz has no clue what they are doing..<br />
<br />
Elusiveness (Rank 2)<br />
Reduces the cooldown of your Vanish and Blind abilities by 60 sec and your Cloak of Shadows ability by 30 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or that you're being a douche. Either/or.<br />

They said they may cap the bonus at 51-55 points.<br />
<br />
Hybrid specs won't benefit from the lower-tier talents, and they also mentioned that they might only give you the bonus from your primary tree.</div></div><hr />

So you wanna screw the rest of the classes...... cause your to lazy to lvl another toon? Is that what Im getting from this? Im sorry my warrior can tank and dps if I want to. Well guess what.... I thought about that before I lvled him. Maybe you should have done the same I think.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We don't know. However, it's more likely that it's a buff at 80 but that it normalizes itself at 85 because everything there will be tuned to Mastery and the new stat system. In addition, Mastery will not exist on current level 80 gear, it will be added onto our gear as we get gear from levels 80-85.</div></div><hr />
