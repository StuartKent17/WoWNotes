Epic gems for ... 10 badges ?<br />
The 4th phase is active on at least one of the US server, and all the items related to this phase have been activated on the official armory. That's where it gets interesting, you could buy all the epic gems from Shaani for 15 badges during the testing phase of the patch on Test Servers, but according to the official armory (http://www.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=29434) the price has been lowered to 10 badges ! <br />
<br />
It's still unclear if it's a bug from the armory or an intended change but we'll probably have to wait until players on Proudmoore complete the alchemy lab to get a definitive answer.<br />

Arena Tournament Second Qualifying Round<br />
When we have dates for the second qualification round we will provide a schedule for it just like we have for the first qualifier.<br />
<br />
We have not announced when and where the regional qualifier will take place. When we get closer to it happening we will announce it on the website and forums.<br />

Arena class representation<br />
Vhairi (http://vhairi.blogspot.com/2008/04/us-stats-april-2008.html) released a bunch of interesting stats on his blog (http://vhairi.blogspot.com/2008/04/us-stats-april-2008.html), analyzing the amount of players playing each class in Arena Tournaments for all 3 brackets. <br />
2v2 Arena is clearly dominated by Druids and Warriors, followed by Rogues and Warlocks. At high level the population of Mages, Paladins, Hunters, and Shamans is almost non-existant compared to the first 4 classes. <br />
3v3 isn't really different, Warriors, Druids, and Rogues are still on top, with the additions of Priests. At high level the amount of warlocks match the other &quot;unpopular&quot; classes.<br />
5v5 is where all the non-druid healers hide, with Priests, Shamans, and Paladins on top. The most popular non-healing classes are Warriors and Warlocks. <br />

Except they get steamrolled by hunter/druid.<br />

The low representation of hunters in that bracket even after the buff, when I know how stupidly powerful they are paired with a druid makes me laugh. Confirms how dire most people are at this game.</div></div><hr />

I didn't even do one quest for the heroic badge vendor because it was guaranteed that I would be ganked (I know Proudmoore is a PVE server).<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see if the gems remain at 10 badges a piece.</div></div><hr />

The problems hunters have in the arena don't suddenly vanish when they are grouped with a druid.<br />
<br />
Even when people get numbers that back this up, they come with:&quot;but the hunters suck because they can't play&quot;. Seriously, get a clue, it's getting old and makes you look like a fool.</div></div><hr />

Nice to know, since my three 70-chars are Shaman, Mage, Paladin.<br />
Three friends of mine all started a Hunter as first char.<br />
I'll probably make a video throwing away all my gear and deleting them... or qq some more till they buff shamans back to new glory, like in the old days... ::)</div></div><hr />

Anyone know how close Proudmoore are to completing the Alchemy Lab yet? I'm keen to know how many badges I'm going to have to shell out to gem up my Brutal gear...</div></div><hr />
