The Noblegarden is now live on european servers and will be available in the US in a few hours. Before you read the &quot;guide&quot; you have to keep in mind that this event is very simple and didn't change since last year.<br />
<br />
1. Brightly Colored Eggs are hidden in the starting town of each races: Bloodhoof Village, Brill, Falcowing Square, and Razor Hill for the Horde. Azure Watch, Goldshire, Dolanaar, and Kharanos for the Alliance. The eggs are only in this town and will respawn in a few seconds/minutes, it probably won't be enough during the first days of the event because a LOT of players will be camping them. They're hidden in different spots of the town and might be a little hard to find at first, but it becomes very easy when you know what you're looking for. <br />
<br />

<br />
2. Looting the eggs will give you a <br />
http://static.wowhead.com/images/icons/tiny/achievement_noblegarden_chocolate_egg.gifNoblegarden Chocolate (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44791) or one of the rare item from the event, you can also buy all of them with the chocolates if you're lucky enough with your eggs. Please note that <br />
Dressed for the Occasion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/249) and Sunday's Finest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/248) will not work if you buy the items from the NPC, you have to find the items in an egg to complete the achievement. (These 2 achievements are NOT part of the Noble Gardener (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2797) meta-achievement.<br />
<br />
3. When you've got enough chocolate to buy all the items you need for the achievements, the only thing left to do is to complete the achievements that require you to travel in other zones/continents : <br />
Desert Rose (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2436), <br />
Spring Fling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2419) / Spring Fling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2497) and <br />
Noble Garden (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2420) / Noble Garden (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2421). <br />
<br />
The Noblegarden Vendors (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/april/noblegarden_vendor.jpg) will let you buy the items you want if you can't find them in eggs.<br />

Recent In-Game Fixes - April 2010 - 4/2<br />
Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game. Keep in mind that some of these changes may not be active until after the realm has been restarted.<br />
<br />
4/2<br />
The agility bonus provided by the Strength of Earth totem now applies to characters within the appropriate range. <br />
<br />

Blue posts<br />
&quot;Next swing&quot; attacks<br />
Next swing attacks are all going to die. The experience of using them is underwhelming, their mechanics are confusing, and they might even cause real world pain. :( (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038607788-when-will-hybrid-tax-apply-to-fury-warriors.html))<br />
<br />
Classes Resources<br />
Resources for all classes are supposed to matter. If they weren't supposed to matter then we could certainly simplify the game by removing them all. For some classes or specs, the actual resource is GCDs not a bar that fills up.<br />
<br />
Rage, energy, runes and soon focus are essentially infinite. You only risk running out for short periods of time, but they'll be back eventually.<br />
<br />
For mana-using dps specs, the gameplay is similar but the time slice is broader. A mage isn't going to run out of mana in the first few seconds of a fight. She might run out later, particularly in a longer fight, but she also has ways to get that mana back, and then using those at the right time becomes some of the skill of playing that class.<br />
<br />
Healers all use mana, and they are supposed to run out of mana if they make bad decisions. That isn't currently happening, but it will in Cataclysm. Healers feel singled-out by that design, but we believe that when healers have infinite mana that we lose controls in designing an encounter. We have to rely on killing characters faster than healers can respond, punishing players dramatically for doing or failing to do some key event in the fight, or relying on dps checks with berserk timers and the like. Healer mana is a tool we had in BC and lost in LK. When the raid takes too much avoidable damage, then the healers eventually gas out (after using their own tools for mana restoration, like Divine Plea and Innervate) and the group then dies. Put another way, the game is just too easy when healers can just rely on their most powerful spell all of the time (many of us also think the healer gameplay is a little boring when you arne't using all your spells).<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to derail the topic from rage, but I did want to explain why we think it's okay for some characters to have infinite resources and some to risk running out. But the resource itself still needs to matter even if it is effectively infinite. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038607788-when-will-hybrid-tax-apply-to-fury-warriors.html))<br />
<br />
Threat in ICC<br />
You need to look at the specific situations in which it's actually happening. We don't see a lot of people pulling off of tanks on single-target fights say 30 seconds into the fight. That is even more true if you make use of Tricks or Misdirect.<br />
<br />
Where it does happen is in the first few seconds of a fight or new adds coming to a fight or sometimes if you're AE'ing a large group and the tank can't generate threat on everything.<br />
<br />
And yes, threat needs to not fall off as much as everyone gears up. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038828445-threat-in-icc-particularly-10-mans.html))<br />

Rage Management<br />
The problem with BC was that the rage solution we implemented felt like rage starvation and rather than adjust the model we kind of threw in the towel. I agree that having no rage and no way to get rage is frustrating. Part of our plan is to give warriors (and bears) more control over it.<br />
<br />
It’s really not a damage issue so we don’t even need to get into whether warriors are doing too much damage in ICC or not. (Though I’d argue on some fights they are.) The real issue is that their damage doesn't stay in proportion with the other classes and is even more gear dependent. Until they have adequate rage coming in, they can’t use enough abilities. Once they have enough rage coming in, they can mash their buttons continuously. We don't want rage to be something you graduate from. It is the entire core of the warrior class, along with stances.

I guess it is in the way it works if you have it activated to go on your next attack and you use another ability like mortal strike and you're like wtf it didnt go off.<br />

Healers all use mana, and they are supposed to run out of mana if they make bad decisions. That isn't currently happening...<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard apparently hasn't played a resto shaman.<br />
<br />
On any heroic fight in 10 or 25 man ICC that isn't 100% chain heal spam friendly, resto shaman mana is atrocious.<br />
<br />
I have all 264+ gear, replenishment, wisdom, full buffs, runic mana pot, mana tide, one innervate and I will OOM in less than two minutes of constant casting a well balanced mixture of chain heal, LHW, and riptide. <br />
<br />
The fact that blizzard claims &quot;all&quot; healers have infinite mana just further convinces me that they have absolutely no connection to the shaman class right now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grumplepuss</div><div class="date">2010-04-04, 04:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Healers all use mana, and they are supposed to run out of mana if they make bad decisions. That isn't currently happening, but it will in Cataclysm. Healers feel singled-out by that design, but we believe that when healers have infinite mana that we lose controls in designing an encounter. We have to rely on killing characters faster than healers can respond, punishing players dramatically for doing or failing to do some key event in the fight, or relying on dps checks with berserk timers and the like. Healer mana is a tool we had in BC and lost in LK. When the raid takes too much avoidable damage, then the healers eventually gas out (after using their own tools for mana restoration, like Divine Plea and Innervate) and the group then dies. Put another way, the game is just too easy when healers can just rely on their most powerful spell all of the time (many of us also think the healer gameplay is a little boring when you arne't using all your spells).<br />
<br />
<br />
At the beginning of Cataclysm healers will run out of mana. This won't last long. I remember the last big regen nerf, it took about 2 weeks and I didn't run out of mana again. I don't see your little healers don't go OOM problem as a big deal, because you just fail so hard at designing gear. Within 2-3 months of Cataclysm the gear that is out will be so poorly designed, you can just throw whatever the new best gem for your class will be in it and win. Just like what has always happened, and at the end of Cataclysm we will see another stupid post about healers never going OOM and how in the next expansion they will. You guys at Blizz should just design better encounters and have better stat allocation on gear.</div></div><hr />

Going from hardmodes in ulduar until icc25 has been very stressfull for healers, their whole approach to making healers even more oom in cata wont last long.</div></div><hr />

And stop about the event,, jeez its just a event that isn't even the biggest/most important one. <br />
<br />
<br />
Dont give me the shaman = OOM! blizz is noob talk!!!<br />
<br />
If you read correctly blizz is not talking about the amount of mana but how you use it. <br />
Dont say &quot;blizz dont know shammies, I am oom all the time&quot; Blizz wants you to get oom when you fail at healing. <br />
<br />
&quot;they are supposed to run out of mana if they make bad decisions&quot; <br />
<br />
Do you want infinite mana? NO! (its already easy enough)<br />
<br />
We all QQ about how wow failed when TBC and LK came,, How good Vanilla was etc etc. <br />
Well they are slightly listing, they look back and now they analyses the changes. And please dont <br />
say that you dont agree with me, that the game is to easy. Raids need to be hard to complete, now you can just find a random group and do all. <br />
So this is what they are working on, by making the chance bigger to fail. I like it! Give me the win in the raids and let me get that epic gear that only a few have.<br />
Now everyone has the same gear, and blizz sees that :) <br />
<br />
Also they say that they wanna punish players when they make a bad decision, GREAT! I can only think of whipes and long hard tries to do it right. <br />
I even think blizz is really working on making the raids hard, especially the old ones. <br />
<br />
Blizz admits the game is to easy, and the screw up with LK. This post gave me my hopes back on a new epic experience and a bit of old wow. <br />
<br />
Finally, I think we are getting a good expansion, now blizz you have to work on getting AV to be a real battle again, instead of rush rush win... I am sure you can do that!<br />
And blizz must make gear not that overpowerd, think thats a big problem when trying to make raid tougher. <br />
<br />
Please reply on me on this, tell me where I am wrong, or add to my post! <br />
<br />
<br />
So please read carefully before you bring up the shamy blablabla (if you are oom now... well work on it because you will fail in cataclysm!! :D) <br />

You're just used to having replenish, as its hard to NOT have in a 25. Try a 10 man heroic with no ret palys, spriests, or survival hunters. It's a totally different story as a resto shammy. I see my healers go oom and have to innervate at every available tank swap.</div></div><hr />

It did feel kind of spammy, especially in prot and fury, but i really enjoyed using it as arms... i found my dps didn't change too much when i'd almost entirely remove slam and use sunder/HS or Cleave when rage got high. One thing to note (before i get all this hate) is that i had very poor gear as it was barely an offspec.. execute was still as good as mortal strike and only a lil worse than overpower... but still, slam sucked at that point.<br />
<br />
All in all, i just kind of enjoyed it. Made warrior dps feel a little more unique then the other classes. kind of had two different timelines to worry about, since your gcd was about 1.5 seconds and weapon speeds were always greater... so you'd maybe get 2 next melee swings in the time it would take for you to get 3 or 4 gcd moves in... doesn't seem like much, but if every other class (cept rogues and dk's in unholy presence) would take just as much time to get 3 or 4 gcd moves in, you hit more buttons in that same amount of time. Kind of rambling, but i just don't understand why everyone hates it THAT much.<br />
<br />
moving on, though, and since there's nothing i can say that will make blizz change their mind (lol) how do you guys think they're going to change rage up?<br />
<br />
If they remove the next-melee attacks, i think they might incorporate some weaker attacks that give you rage, like make a heroic-strike-like melee attack that did 100% weapon damage, but also granted rage as a normal hit. This combined with maybe lowering the amount of rage granted from normal melee attacks would make the warrior have to make a choice between weaker move that allows me to use a stronger move next gcd, or use two weak moves that cost less rage, but then have to rely on the next melee or something...<br />
<br />
This is just a thought, and i probably lost half of you in my fragmented sentence, but lets see what some of you guys are thinking!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah... Warrior class balancing is like the boom and bust cycle of our jacked up economy. If they don't address the way we scale with gear they will never stop having to nerf damage. I lol'd at the 10% damage buff in ICC now. Like, &quot;Oooh oooh so I get my real TG back now huh&quot;. Then they want to claim we're doing too much damage on ICC fights. How about if Blizz quit adding more tiers of gear to the game we wouldn't find ourselves in this situation now. I mean I'm not complaining. My Fury dps is pwnsauce. I guess what I'm saying is they should either completely redesign the warrior class so they can put us where they want us and keep us there, or they should just leave us the hell alone. But 10% flat nerfs because they can't figure out how to control the class they created sucks donkey ballz.</div></div><hr />

It pays to wait until a. A Few days into the event; and b. Off-peak times for your server. Go to the village you believe there will be the least amount of people looking for eggs (for Alliance, this is probably Dolanaar). If you are after the necessary achievements, don't bother with the other two; just collect chocolates until you have enough for those ones.<br />
<br />
Last year, I ran around the Draenei village, collecting eggs for ages. Makes me wonder why I only have one achievement from this event. Maybe it's because I just spent all my chocolates on Polymorph: Rabbit (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44793). XD</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ugh, I know it's not all that great, but I can think of at least a couple examples where I don't like this change.<br />
<br />
Listing one just for reference, I liked that I could 'queue' a raptor strike and close to melee and hit mongoose bite and get 2 melee (possibly quite damaging as Survival) hits back to back instantly.<br />
Of course as I write this, I remember blizzard is also removing mongoose bite in the expansion so I guess that will make it a non-issue. (thanks bliz? LOL Don't really understand that change)<br />
But yeah, I can think of similar scenarios involving my druid tanking and using maul.<br />
<br />
So over all, probably a nice change for most people, but I am slightly annoyed by the change since they could leave in next swing moves in the game, and just change the ones they wanted to be instant activated attacks for the classes that wanted them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, its all the same :P Only took a few hours to complete, having to work around douches grabbing mah eggs...</div></div><hr />

So we got 4 so far.<br />
<br />
DK has 4 atleast, depending on spec:<br />

30 macros my ass, if you're that hard pressed at making a macro, more to the point NEED a macro, i feel sorry for you, maybe you should roll and easier class, i hear Arc mages are hard to play.<br />
<br />
<br />
For my Druid I have !Maul macro'd to:<br />
* Faerie Fire (Feral)<br />
* Mangle (Bear)<br />
* Lacerate<br />
* Swipe<br />
* Feral Charge (Bear)<br />
<br />
For my Death Knight I have !Rune Strike macro'd to:<br />
* Blood Boil<br />
* Blood Strike<br />
* Death Coil<br />
* Death Strike<br />
* Frost Strike<br />
* Howling Blast<br />
* Heart Strike<br />
* Icy Touch<br />
* Obliterate<br />
* Plague Strike<br />
* Pestilence<br />
* Scourge Strike<br />
<br />
So 20 wasn't that much of an exageration (I was expecting it to be less, in case you didn't get that).<br />
<br />
Pressing Maul or Rune Strike separately has always been an utter waste of time. It wasn't laziness, it was a stupid, pointless mechanic. There was no reason not to have it macro'd to everything.</div></div><hr />

See, alot of those you dont NEED/Should have macroed.... BB/HB/FS... and a few of those spells are set tree only, there for you wouldnt have then...<br />
<br />
See heres the thing, its not really a stupid mechanic, as a Fury war, its kinda a DPS loss to use HS with under 50 rage, thus giving an aspect of managment to your rage.<br />
<br />
So yup...</div></div><hr />
