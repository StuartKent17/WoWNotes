With the release of 4.2 all Valor Points will be down-converted to Justice Points, and all Conquest Points will be down-converted to Honor Points. To curb the ability to sell items back to the vendors after the conversion for the higher currency, we’re instituting a new sellback policy for items purchased directly before currency down-conversions.<br />
<br />
Items purchased within the two hour window before the release of 4.2 will lose their ability to be sold back to the vendor when the realms are brought down for maintenance. No refunds will be granted for items purchased during this time, either by the in-game vendors, or our support departments.<br />
<br />
As an example, I buy the Vicious Gladiator's Battle Staff (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/67450/vicious-gladiators-battle-staff/) at 2:30 a.m. The servers come down for the release of 4.2 half an hour later. Normally I would still have an hour and a half after the servers return to sell the item back to the vendor. With this policy change though, upon logging in my item can no longer be sold back to the vendor.<br />
<br />
This policy is only in effect for maintenances that include currency down-conversions, such as the release of 4.2. To ensure you don’t purchase the wrong item with the inability to sell it back, we recommend buying well before the final two hours so there’s time to change any incorrect purchases.<br />
<br />
For more information on the down-conversion please refer to: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/2880562</div></div><hr />

<br />
As in will you keep any honor/justice over 4000 when 4.2 hits? If thats your question no, you'll get gold for anything over a 4k combined of conquest/honor and justice/valor points.<br />
<br />
The maximum allowable justice and honor points you will have when 4.2 hits is 4k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;All existing Conquest Points in the Currency tab have been converted to Honor Points. Any points above the Honor Point cap must be spent within the next week before Season 10 starts. Once Season 10 begins, all Honor Points exceeding the 4,000 point cap will be converted into gold at a rate of 35 silver per point and mailed to characters.&quot;<br />
<br />
From the patch notes.<br />
<br />
You have one week to bring your combined Conquest/Honor points (which are now ALL Honor points) below 4000. <br />
<br />
For Valor and Justice however you instantly have converted to gold anything above 4k combined once the patch goes live, no one weeks grace to spend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
think it's only for the valor to Justice conversion, so i think that since JP wont be downgraded it's safe to say that it'll be ok there.<br />
<br />
and btw i love this idea! it messes up those that had been planning on cheesing getting gear and quick VP!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't think so, as the post starts out mentioning JP and VP items. Otherwise you'd have people trying to get VP early, or extra JP to gear faster.<br />

Actually, they clearly say that honor above the 4000 point cap will be converted to gold when the new season starts, which currently is 1 week after 4.2 is expected to go live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The simpliest way of looking at what they want to do is as follows: Any item that has the 2 hour refund timer on it when the server goes down to apply 4.2, all those items will become soulbound, regardless of when you bought it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure I read it that way too, so you have 1 week to spend any excess honor before anything over 4k will get converted to gold upon the new season start, however I'm not entirely sure. Got link to blue post? Can't seem to find it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doubt there were many.<br />
<br />
I think some might have saved a few points, but it isn't all that bad considering that any honor (converted from CPs) exceeding 4k will just fill your wallet a bit. Money is welcome thing after all considering all the gold sinks that a major content patch brings with it.</div></div><hr />

That being said you can still cheese having over 4000 honor points or valor points by spending the higher tier on items and just buying and re selling all week till the new season hits so potentially you could have 8000 vp or hp saved up in items and points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, you are right there.<br />
<br />
I was more referring to the fact that we actually get something out of our excess CPs and Honor. I remember the days they just simply wiped it clean, so I guess something is better than nothing.</div></div><hr />

I hope this change will affect JP and Honor points.. If it didnt then it would be &quot;silly&quot;. But! if you try it, and you can sell them back, il bet they will remove the items afterwards anyway<br />

<br />
For point transfers, Its not been done this way in the past. Previously, the announcement would be made and you just had to buy what you could before the higher PvP tier points were wiped out. There were tokens you could buy to downgrade any leftover arena points into honor, but you were capped at about 2000 honor worth of conversion tokens IIRC. For PvE, there was no points, just tokens and they continued to buy exactly what they bought before the content patch... there were just new tokens that came from new content and new items to buy with them. This is the first time PvE is getting a &quot;conversion&quot;.<br />

<br />
It says any Items wont be able to be sold back after servers restart, only the one example was conquest--but that doesn't limit the policy to conquest only or even conquest and valor. I would definitely expect it to apply to all item sellback cooldowns regardless of which tier vendor you bought them from.</div></div><hr />

Won´t be soulbound - you just can´t return them to get the points back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz just wants to prevent your can't buy higher tier items with having deserved them. From what I read you can definitely buy gear to make sure the lower tier won't get over your cap. So you can convert all your conquest points to honor points, buy gear that is not going to get upgraded (like BOA heirlooms), and sell them back after the patch (one by one). At no point you can have more than 4000 points, so anything over that will be wiped.<br />
<br />
You can not, get any valor or conquest gear like this, you will have to earn the points. <br />
You can save more than 4000 justice points or honor points like this. (Unless Blizz decides otherwise)<br />
<br />
Don't forget you can trade honor with justice points, to max out your point savings. <br />
<br />
By the way, what I have done in the past is to buy point gear, get refund, but use it in the meantime (no enchants / gems), just to get started. For some reason all the drops ALWAYS are exactly the piece that I just bought... and this kind of solves that. Forgetting to sell back in time does not - lol. <br />
<br />
In any case, it is just a game, looking forward to the shorter dungeon queues now all the crafter tanks need their orbs, and the runs will be easier now some of us will be outgeared :-0</div></div><hr />
