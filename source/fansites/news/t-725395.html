We're simultaneously working on a &quot;war games&quot; mode for battlegrounds that allows groups to challenge other groups to a battle in a specific battleground (including horde vs horde and alliance vs alliance). Granted, the rewards aren't significant, but it's more for players to be able to have fun battling their guildmates and friends or for players on a server to throw down for the sake of pride and bragging rights.<br />
<br />
[...] You'll still only be grouped with players of your language, although your opponents can be from whatever part of the region, regardless of language.<br />
<br />
ohhh man there should soooo be a tool that lets you set out rewards for these matches. Something like you team opens a game, you set a 100gold reward for the winning team. everyone in your team has to have 100 gold to enter. the winning teams players get +100g each and the losing teams players -100g each.</div></div><hr />

We all watched MLG. I have refrained from commenting because all of the discussions in this forum seem to devolve into &quot;my class didn't win, so clearly other guys are overpowered&quot; or &quot;GC loves whichever comp wins.&quot; Frankly, I thought it was one of the best tournaments I've seen in awhile. It's hard to argue that the guys who won did so because they chose the overpowered comp -- those guys are insanely skilled and played very well. We had pretty good class representation over all, but I still think it's a small sample size from which to draw a lot of conclusions about class balance. If Orange or someone had gone for a three healer comp would we really be here arguing that three healers are OP?<br />

What I am trying to say is that if we just wanted Spell Reflect or whatever to be super easy to use that we would take away the shield requirement or just have it auto-switch to a shield. Being able to pull it off at the right time is the hallmark of a great warrior. If you watch some of these really skilled players play, yeah I'd argue their intuition does seem to border on ESP&quot;&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be an awsome change if they made Spell reflect useable without shield. To equip the shield + then reflect makes a small delay.<br />
<br />
Same thing for shield bash they should make a new Silence for battle stance so u doint have to switch stance or go sword and board to shield bash</div></div><hr />

I hope they don't gut the old ability simply to give us an enrage dispeller which, quite frankly, I don't really use that often, and in pve our melee enrage-dispeller will always be inferior to the ranged tranq shot.</div></div><hr />

lol yeah AV will be weird indeed. But those &quot;War&quot; games may not apply to Isle of Conquest and Alterac Valley because it needs 40 man and you can only join as a party. Maybe only 10 and 15 man battlegrounds will be available.</div></div><hr />

A few days lost spending time on MMO-Champ is nothing compared to having it around and working for cata. Keep on going :P</div></div><hr />

Planning out PvP from a commander PoV might be quite fun, although, who knows what direction it will take off in.</div></div><hr />

Looks like there will be even less come Cata.<br />
<br />
every warrior ive seen is always competing for the top dps spot under mages,DKs and druids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i keep getting this feeling that their goal for warrior dps in cataclysm is to completely gut it to make even the best warriors come in just above the tanks in dps. rage normalization the past two times they did it was a huge nerf to warrior dps. armor pen being a dps warriors best stat next to strength, and crit going bye bye for fury also as arms will get the armor pen mastery. and severely nerfing our AE dps. what do we get out of it? oh heroic strike on a gcd.. which is a nerf also. but hey.. we'll finally get heroic leap which will probably hit for crap damage, and be on a 2 minute cooldown. yay.<br />
<br />
looks like it's time to dust off my mage.</div></div><hr />

Can't help but feel like we are gonna get the nerf bat swung at us hard, just cause we top raid dps. What people fail to recognize is that warriors performing so well in raid dps generally have a certain weapon equipped... you know a certain ilvl 284 weapon.</div></div><hr />
