Garothi Worldbreaker Preview<br />
Garothi Worldbreaker is the first boss in the upcoming raid: Antorus, the Burning Throne.<br />

<br />
Constructed deep within the core of Argus and outfitted with an arsenal capable of decimating worlds, this war machine has been designed for a single purpose: to bring the mortals' invasion to its knees.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - The fel reaver's cannons continously alternate between Annihilation (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/244761-annihilation) and Decimation (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/244410-decimation). Upon reaching 65% and 25% health, the fel reaver activates its Apocalypse Drive (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/244152-apocalypse-drive) exposing its weapon platforms. Unless one of these weapons is destroyed before the cast can complete, the party will be eradicated. On Mythic difficulty, the cannons can no longer be destroyed, but instead go haywire, granting the cannons additional effects.<br />

Hi, Dave, can you explan how a Shaman work, use every Shaman Decay? Or only Dark-shamans? What is with the Taunka? Thank you!<br />
Shaman use the four elements and &quot;spirit&quot; to bring them to life. Only dark shaman forego spirit and use the elements with decay. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/912728280276467713))<br />
...and that Taunka are Taunka. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/912728320013352960))<br />

Game Developer Tweets<br />
What is the biggest challenge in implementing new features in a game like World of Warcraft?<br />
I mean, the biggest challenge is making sure the feature is fun. It’s pretty easy in a rewards-based game to manipulate players into engaging in something that isn’t actually fun for them, so just looking at players using the feature can give you a false read.<br />
<br />
For any big game like WoW, the challenges of adding new features are along these lines:<br />
<br />
<br />
Is this the best use of our dev resources compared to something else we could be doing?<br />
Is the eventual upkeep of this feature (bugs, bit rot, expectations of additional content, player support when someone opens a ticket, etc.) going to be worth it?<br />
Does the complexity of the game get too great with these feature layered on top of all of our other feature? I’ll point out WoW professions as one of those systems that constantly gets knocked around by other systems, sometimes unintentionally. For example, if quest rewards are too generous, there is less need for profession equipment. If there are more efficient ways to make gold, there is less need for gold from trade skills.<br />
Does the complexity of the game get so great that players don’t have the mental bandwidth to deal with it all?<br />
Does this feature compete with some other feature? Are players going to chose X over Y or Y over X instead of them living compatibly?<br />
Are players going to use the feature in the ways you expect? Strictly speaking, it’s fun and often exciting if players use the feature in a way you didn’t anticipate, but you should make sure they are still having fun and you aren’t undermining other parts of the game.<br />
What is the player need you are trying to meet with the feature? Will your feature really meet those goals? Is there a better way? Is there some feature already in the game that will do a better job?<br />

yes because low level economy was working only because of mains... and no crafting for low levels destroyed from heirlooms, before heirloom it was still a thing, I remember it very well.</div></div><hr />

I did level 2 classes during vanilla and all the rest on TBC. I was using mostly crafting gear. Can you elaborate why crafting leveling gear destroyed in TBC? My experience says otherwise... crafting gear was still good even in WotLK cause there was very few heirlooms back then and you needed to fill the rest of the gear... plus leveling was still a thing, even in wrath.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't. At least it wasn't entirely destroyed. I do remember making initial gold on new characters by crafting low level rings and necklaces in WoTLK, cloth and leather items. It was selling well.<br />
<br />
Heirlooms did contribute to that. Can't deny that. Then scaling enchants contributed further, removing need for low level enchants, thus further reducing market for low level greens.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, by Wrath, if you were spending gold on crafting things, or buying from the AH, you were doing it wrong. You were leveling speedily that they were replaced pretty quickly, including gear you got form quests and dungeons.<br />
<br />
Honestly though, low level crafting/drops from leveling sell rather well now thanks to Transmogrification.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because buying crafting gear was a waste of gold, since you will replace it as soon as you hit dungeons or complete a new quest. TBC taught that good, not everyone learned the lesson though as shown by your personal experience.... the only way you can make gold with crafting gear is at the start of expansion to sell gear to people who cba to grind ilvl to get access to heroics ASAP, which will be replaced as soon as they get the access. That's how useful crafting gear was and is since Cata at least. Heirlooms back then were ilvl 1 for LFG so you couldn't even queue in it.<br />

No, that's the purging of complexity done on purpose. We also lost low rank skills which could turn a mediocre player into a good player in terms of mana efficiency. Everything scales since then.</div></div><hr />

Even in wrath the leveling was not so speedy as to ignore gearing up here and there... and where still some good crafts and drops (especially the TBC ones with 2-3 sockets) that were worth a lot...<br />

<br />
Of course many people dare to play the MMOs &quot;wrong&quot; and care for their gear while leveling and didnt mind to spend time and gold to level their crafting and craft for themeselves.. not to mention that many people also love crafting and to be able to craft for themeselves.. not everyone see the game as numbers.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say anything about it being right or wrong. We were talking about usefulness of crafting gear, there ain't any. If you love crafting gear for yourself - knock yourself out, but that doesn't make crafting gear useful.</div></div><hr />

Yes leveling was not that fast and unless someone was a deeper raider in TBC their gear would be further behind. Like those that at best did some ZA 10 mans and IQD Content. My raiding Druid had most of it's gear not bested until around Icecrowne. Prior to that everything was inferior to my raiding gear for the most part. Think the first thing I finally replaced was a Belt. The main things that were still used by crafters was specific ammo with needing Goblin/Gnome Engineers depending on your weapon. The only other items that survived would be profession specific and even then they are generally beaten if you did more content. <br />
<br />
Many in TBC did Arena to be able to even get Epics and they continued to try in Wrath. But in every scenario crafting did not match them. The last time I truly remember crafting being the demands is rare and short like Engineering Goggles unless you were raiding upper content or how I knew a Paladin in TBC that used the Skillherald because he had crap luck on the mace from BT. But in most cases the crafted are trumped by other content. So players always talked about crafting die'n just like if PvP gear doesn't match the raiding gear for item level people try to act like it's unfair. Heirlooms however never played a part in that since those buying gear to level were likely a select few and only a couple slots that kept lagging behind while they were leveling or twinks.</div></div><hr />

Hm, that shouldn't be happening at all. If you visit https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v178922379&amp;autoplay=false&amp;t=03h48m44s does that happen?</div></div><hr />

That seems like a browser / Twitch problem then. Maybe some extension you have installed?</div></div><hr />
