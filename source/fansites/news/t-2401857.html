At least this is a free comic, not a $20 novel, so we at least have that... :3<br />
<br />
I also like how she bypasses Anduin in this, is this maybe a hint of more people having plans outside of just doing what they’re told?</div></div><hr />

True, and I don't mean to complain as it were, but this feels like content most players would need to see so make sense of the story to come - and I don't think the external content (short stories, novels, comics, etc.) are often consumed except by a minority of players.</div></div><hr />

But seeing how a lot of Hordelings post here, with how meat headed and &quot;kill the allicucks&quot; and even that band at Blizzcon calling Alliance 'faggots', I assumed all the alt-Horde wanted was to just murder Alliance. Now you actually want plot reasons to justify genocide, mass killings, and war crimes?</div></div><hr />

she doesn't even know she's undead yet (possibly), a short scene on argus makes it sound like she may be about to find out, but we don't know until the comic comes out. the horde destroyed their lives, it's 100% healthy and normal to not have any reason whatsoever to believe that her being a warchief is somewhat ok</div></div><hr />

She stopped hating the horde when on Draenor as in the book Beyond Dark Portal.

<br />
Yeah I really disliked that. Alleria's supposedly been away for a thousand years, and she picks a faction and dismisses Sylvanas' motivations without actually even meeting her? Surely she's gotten over her dislike of the Horde enough in a thousand years to at least listen to Sylvanas first.<br />
<br />
I don't know. Maybe it's explainable by the fact that Vereesa was there, whispering in her ear and telling her how Sylvanas is secretly Hitler or something, but they never actually stated that anywhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Man, imagine the dilemma: Turalyon will be 100% Alliance, no ifs or buts, and Alleria would have to choose between her people and him. I imagine she'd at the very least pull away from the war itself and try being neutral and joining Khadgar and Magni's Scooby Crew. And high chances would be that they'd not introduce the Void Elves in this case and go with something else.</div></div><hr />

Oh c'mon, that's not a fair comparison.<br />

<br />
Trolls (not the ones in the current Horde) had a longstanding war with the elves and killed her brother. They allied with the orcs which is why Silvermoon allied with Lordaeron. <br />
<br />
A human price of Lordaeron had a power trip and lead an undead army that almost totally destroyed Silvermoon. Other humans who were still alive after this tried to kill the rest of the High Elves who became Blood Elves.<br />

Which one seems worse? The ones who killed a few or the ones responsible for near extinction of their race?<br />

<br />
Neither one of them should be Alliance. Or Horde. They fought a war for 1000 years against Sargeras, the greatest enemy of Azeroth, so they would likely not jump into the petty factional struggle after so great an undertaking. This factional conflict BTW could destroy the planet they wanted to save. It makes more sense for them to advocate peace and maybe rebuilding to fight some future powerful enemy.<br />
<br />
Part of the reason I won't be playing BoA for a while if ever is that Legion is the end of all of the conflicts that started in WC1. Sargeras is dead, there is nothing else worthwhile to fight.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they are all gold diggers who prey on the shorter lifespan of humans! Of course that failed spectacularly given how Nathanos is undead and Tyralyon presumably have a longer than average lifespan because of the whole army of the light thing he has going on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heheh I like when you say &quot;she would rationally...&quot; and then proceed to put everything through horde bias.<br />
<br />
Look, we didn't get to see the whole of Alleria's learning about what has happened in game, but it's pretty evident she did her due diligence before going to visit Lor'themar; it only doesn't make &quot;rational&quot; sense if you believe she would obviously side with the Thalassian government and the horde.<br />
<br />
And let's be clear, Alleria didn't care much for the government hen she decided to hunt down the horde, she always followed her own set of morals. A set of morals that lead her to see the alliance as her place, with a resolution that led her to be consider on of its greatest heroes. <br />
<br />
Now we see her deciding that Quel'thalas made the wrong choices and her goal is to make it return to the alliance.<br />
<br />
Disagree with her all you want, but to pretend this somehow betrays her character is just bias. Alleria has been staunchly alliance and anti horde since forever, that she &quot;forgave&quot; the horde doesn't mean at all she would happily JOIN them. Alleria isn't a Thalassian Nationalist, if anything she has the same sort of moralistic point of view than Vereesa that lead them to choose loyalty to those that thought like her than loyalty over her goverment, who she sees as flawed as its her duty to do something about it.<br />
<br />
So yeah, she's an extremist.<br />

<br />

<br />
People, CONTEXT. You can't try to parse her motivation thinking how you would think. Alleria was staunchly alliance, she never stopped being alliance, she sacrificed her life to save the alliance and Azeroth. She fell in love with someone who encompassed the greatest virtues of the alliance and had a son with him, all her friends were alliance, all the elves that followed her are still alliance.<br />
<br />
Alleria is alliance, she believes on the alliance. Then the moment they defeated the horde and closed the portal, Quel'thalas just leaves the alliance. How is that not a betrayal of what Alleria believes? She doesn't blame the people, she still wants her people on the alliance, but is pretty evident she things Quel'thalas is in the wrong here.<br />
<br />
So I get there's conflict in her head, but does it really surprise anyone that she would side with the alliance even after all this time? <br />
<br />
If she had returned from Draenor before it exploded, do you think she would have returned to Quel'thalas, or stayed with Vereesa in Dalaran? Do you really think she wouldn't be ashamed of her goverment after everything the Sons of Lothar had to go through?<br />
<br />
Like no joke, if Alleria had returned to Azeroth, it would be her the one leading the Silver Covenant now.</div></div><hr />

This is the last comic of the series so no. At this point Horde players should be happy our characters haven't been all turned into raid bosses for the alliance to kill and loot.<br />

Be happy there is no Horde focus. The best areas of Blizzard lore are the ones that go ignored. As soon as they shine the spotlight on something it gets ruined 90% of the time.</div></div><hr />

I think it would be nice to have a comic of Thrall. Show him taking his kids to school, administering some baptisms to the holy faith of human potential, and maybe having an affair with Jaina.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think it's really that judgemental. Alleria left thinking that the Horde were the enemy and that the undead had decimeter her homeland. Now her sister leads the Horde and is undead. Alleria's reaction is pretty logical. The difference is that Tyrannde has witnessed the changes of perception over time. Alleria has been sitting on it for 1000 years (the 1000 years is another issue we don't need to get into).<br />

Oh yes, we were spoiled. We were ignored in legion, wod we had to kill our greatest heroes, and in MOP we were looted. Unlike you, I do not want you to get the same fucking treatment.</div></div><hr />

Yes she did. Good point. Even so, to her she finds that that the Scourge cut through her homeland. She has missed the development of the Forsaken so I think it's understandable that she doesn't immediately understand the nuances.</div></div><hr />

Those are the lockets Alleria gave to her sisters before she vanished, she kept the emerald, and gave the blue one to sylv. If you played warcraft 3 youll know blue is the color of sylv, and thats how Alleria knew her. Its even evident in BfA cinematic, her outfit was blue when she turned banshee, that was her original outfit before she became dark lady.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what this great Horde storyline you think we had that you didn't get a counterpart to is, but you're seriously mistaken. Since Cataclysm we've just had one iconic character after another killed in books, turned into neutral NPCs, or turned into raid bosses that we have to kill.<br />
<br />
The Horde plot for Cataclysm through Legion can be boiled down to this: &quot;Horde seeks allies and expands, Thrall leaves, Garrosh replaces him. Garrosh kills Cairne, Garrosh is bad, beat up Garrosh, Vol'jin replaces him. Thrall meets parents, Vol'jin says hi, Thrall kills Garrosh. Vol'jin dies, Sylvanas replaces him, Sylvanas and Genn fight and wind up about where they started.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Undead were “a thing” when Alleria was around, in Warcraft 1 (The events of which she’ll have heard about at least), the Horde could summon skeletons, and in Warcraft 2 you had the first Death knights (Shadow council members’ souls crammed into dead paladin bodies), also Horde, so that the idea of her sister being both undead (A pretty unnatural state of existence by any stretch) and leading the Horde (A new Horde yet most of what’s left of the old Horde is still in there) being a bit of a shock to Alleria is one of the more logical bits of BfA lore IMO</div></div><hr />

Totally right, but the undead I was getting at was specifically the Scourge that destroyed Quel'thalas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To most people in fantasy worlds, &quot;Undead&quot; equals &quot;Better kill it again then&quot;, few people bother to differentiate between different factions of undead, especially when their actions are pretty similar (Concocting plagues to spread undeath maybe?), same goes for the Horde, different Horde, except there still are orcs and trolls (Different tribe, but given Alleria's experiences with trolls i doubt she cares) in it, and oh look, they're still rampaging around killing and conquering!<br />
<br />
And then as the cherry on top of a very unappetizing cake: Her sister leads both the undead AND the Horde, so what's there for her to be happy about?</div></div><hr />

You talk as if the comic was just about Sylvanas.<br />

In fact, this section of the comic has already shown that it will be in the perspective of the alliance.<br />

There's at least half a book dedicated to her being released in a week. One would've expected to see a character that is related to Zandalar in some way.<br />
