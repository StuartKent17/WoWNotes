We’re underway with the deployment of our first build of WoW 8.1.5 to our Public Test Realms. We expect it to be playable soon, and we want to start discussions about the features of the update that we’ll be testing:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Kul Tiran Allied Race unlock<br />
The Zandalari Allied Race unlock<br />
Naga invasion World Quests<br />
New portal rooms in faction capitals<br />
The next chapter of pet battle Raiding with Leashes<br />
Warsong Gulch and Arathi Basin visual improvements<br />
<br />
<br />
Our testing in this first build will be primarily technical, so some 8.1.5 features will be locked/unavailable for the first few days while we work on initial concerns:<br />
<br />
<br />
New War Campaign quests<br />
New quests and questlines focused on Magni, Hati, and the eight non-gathering primary Professions<br />
Warlords of Draenor Timewalking dungeons<br />
New Brawl in Arathi Basin vs. AI<br />
Wintergrasp coming to the Epic Battleground list<br />
New Brawler’s Guild update<br />
New Darkmoon Faire roller coaster<br />
New Micro-holidays and updates to Children’s Week<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, you may see some features referenced in this PTR (such as Ashran as an Epic Battleground) that are not part of 8.1.5, but may be introduced in a later update. We’ll keep an eye out for such things and make sure to let you know what we aren’t testing in this PTR.<br />
As always, thank you for your testing and feedback.</div></div><hr />

Battle of Dazar'alor was part of 8.1; it's just time gated. 8.1.5 will be coming later (Likely late Feb/early March) with Crucible of Storms time gated to release after that.</div></div><hr />

?????? <br />
Think about what you just said really carefully. <br />
In case you're still not getting it: You pay for the sub to unlock them (8.1 war campaign) &gt; You pay for the sub again to unlock them pt 2 (8.1 Raid unlock war campaign pt 4) &gt; You pay for the sub again next month to play them after the delay. (8.1.5 release + new campaign)<br />
Even if they release 8.1.5 after only 2 weeks of PTR with the raid itself, they still earned money from delaying them. Not to mention that they've already delayed em for a few months since they were announced features of the expansion itself and should've been included on launch, especially considering the fact that to this day both of em are front and center of the BfA website.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Archibalde</div><div class="date">2019-01-08, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">2 weeks prior to release? WTF!?<br />
k, misinformed.<br />
<br />
Honestly even if it would have been 2 weeks prior to release, it's not like there is much to be tested with this patch. A lot of it is either visual or was already datamined from 8.1. <br />
<br />
The raid was already taken care of with the 8.1 PTR so it's unlikely to be tested here. 2 weeks would have been plenty of time to see if the new Zandalari and Kul'tiran racials were balanced-ish, if the portal rooms didn't have any glaring issues, if Wintergrasp is still fairly balanced at max level and if there are no bugs with the handful of new quests and world quests they're adding. It's a very small content patch that's mostly meant to complete 8.1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is a big patch feature that will get a lot of people playing. Spacing it out so it isn't a part of another big boost in the playerbase like content release patches is definitely for the sake of money.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don’t need to keep subbing after your done the rep you can do all the quest when the time gating is gone. <br />
<br />
So again they make no extra money from delaying it.<br />

I think you're underestimating the appeal for these new Allied Races among the playerbase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you played BfA purely for kul'tiran/zandalari you would have played on launch and did all you could in the first month as your sub ran. Then could have easily thought to yourself &quot;oh, they arn't here yet. I won't resub till they are here and earn em then.&quot; War campaign has been smoothed out, so that requirement becomes a lot easier once the races are here.<br />
<br />
Them still not introducing them is actually making them look bad, so its costing them subs rather than keeping subs active and rolling. A lot of people would still play if they had a new race to level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
it is entirely deserved. label complaints as toxic or whatever you need to cope, i guess. The games has not been in a good state nor have blizzard been in a good standing with its community, and they continue to litter the game with little things like what I originally posted about. Wait till BFDA is cleared for races, actually wait for the patch after. These should be no brainers, things that won't go over well, and they just don't understand how to look better. how to give players what they want.</div></div><hr />

yeah it does.. people would sub in the beginning of the expansion regardless and then they would sub again(if they unsubbed) for the allied races<br />

<br />
I agree with this.<br />
<br />
Especially if they are notified or find out that those races require grinding rep to exalted, which is gated behind WQs which pop every 12 hours AND there's no flight to do them quickly on top of that.<br />
<br />
They'll stay unsubbed.</div></div><hr />

March/April is more likely. Sets up for 8.2 in May/June and the next big raid in June/July. The 2 boss mini-raid will most likely come as a delayed 1.5 &quot;feature&quot;.</div></div><hr />

what does me unsubbing has to do with what i said? its just obvious that some people would come back for allied races<br />
<br />
thats why they spread this content around instead of releasing it on launch, for example<br />
<br />
also they might come back for 8.1 and then quit again after a month.. and then come back for 8.1.5 which will probably come out a couple of months later</div></div><hr />

Think about what you just said really carefully. <br />
In case you're still not getting it: You pay for the sub to unlock them (8.1 war campaign) &gt; You pay for the sub again to unlock them pt 2 (8.1 Raid unlock war campaign pt 4) &gt; You pay for the sub again next month to play them after the delay. (8.1.5 release + new campaign)<br />
Even if they release 8.1.5 after only 2 weeks of PTR with the raid itself, they still earned money from delaying them. Not to mention that they've already delayed em for a few months since they were announced features of the expansion itself and should've been included on launch, especially considering the fact that to this day both of em are front and center of the BfA website.<br />
<br />
It was common knowledge that they weren't being released prior to 8.1.5. Like.. Really common knowledge. You had to have been blind or dense (lets just go with dense for civility's sake) to think otherwise.</div></div><hr />

i hope that there is a good lore reason on why we can't play kultirans or zandalaris.<br />

they literally just started working with the alliance and horde, but have not officially joined their factions.<br />

Ashran???? Ashran is cancer! The worst pvp zone ever in any mmo ever created! Even Hala from Nagrand was 100 x time better. Wintergrasp (without lag) was amazing! Tol Barad was really nice! And they bring back this cancer called Ashran?<br />

lol, why would anyone who quit smoking cigs ever smoke another? All it takes is one stressful day and boom back on the things. Not everyone ofc. Some stay off the cigs, some have a stressful day so they smoke one but then the next day they are done again. WoW is the cigs, stress would be nostalgia and the sunk cost of a favorite game genre that is in a very bad state atm. <br />
<br />
TLDR psychology. Same reason loot boxes are random instead of just letting you buy what you want, same reason gems exist in hots and don't convert to a 1-1 ratio. Psychology.</div></div><hr />

The games has not been in a good state nor have blizzard been in a good standing with its community, and they continue to litter the game with little things like what I originally posted about. Wait till BFDA is cleared for races, actually wait for the patch after. These should be no brainers, things that won't go over well, and they just don't understand how to look better. how to give players what they want.<br />
<br />
If they gave the players all exactly what they wanted we wouldnt even have a game. Take a hard look at what everyone whines about, and an equal amount of people whining for the opposite, and yet there are more that are at the very least content with WoW now (you know, the millions that play and do not whine on forums). So in reality blizzard probably is doing a better job at delivering what the player (in general) wants. And that is not what the minority of extreme whiner players want. <br />

The constant shit posting about bfa is toxic and got dull real quick. It's just obnoxious now.</div></div><hr />

Don't pretend offering the customisation option isn't there because of normal Humans. By that logic Zandalari Trolls should also have barely any because Trolls already exist.<br />

<br />
What delay? did they ever said a date and pushed them back? if you truly knew blizzard from what was seen on beta and PTR it was obvius what was going to happen, even if you did nor inform yourself and paid for 1 month, if you did your research during that month you would know it would be like this, so no surprises.<br />

It was common knowledge when they announced the preorder and put them in the trailer?<br />
<br />
Pretty obvius when the &quot;rumours&quot; of the kul'tirans being a playable race started to not being rumours. <br />
Let's be real, they take the zandalary, the race the horde will share zone for them at the start of the expansion and not the Kult for alliance?<br />
It was all planned, not delayed.<br />
<br />
A decision like &quot;Kul'tirans&quot; as playable race doesn't happen in 2 weeks and changes all.<br />
<br />
The only thing the whiners are right is that blizzard did screw up with the information given. But, being smart enough and informing yourself it was obvius. Also, if the forums where what they should be, a place for information and opinions, there would have been lots of posts talking about it and people would have known before hand. But the forums were drowned in hate and whine, so that information did not reach many eyes. At least that's what I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. There were always going to be only 4 reskins available with the preorder. And it was widely known (whether people wanted to accept it or not) that you would only be able to unlock 2 more reskins at launch (dwarf sooner than orc, but both still there). Blizzard straight up said kul tirans and the troll reskin would come at a later patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ones who still say stuff like that are like the ones who felt Lore called them dickbags, when he said so in a political discussion and had nothing to do about wow, oh entitlement.<br />

Pretty obvius when the &quot;rumours&quot; of the kul'tirans being a playable race started to not being rumours. <br />
Let's be real, they take the zandalary, the race the horde will share zone for them at the start of the expansion and not the Kult for alliance?<br />
It was all planned, not delayed.<br />
<br />
A decision like &quot;Kul'tirans&quot; as playable race doesn't happen in 2 weeks and changes all.<br />
<br />
The only thing the whiners are right is that blizzard did screw up with the information given. But, being smart enough and informing yourself it was obvius. Also, if the forums where what they should be, a place for information and opinions, there would have been lots of posts talking about it and people would have known before hand. But the forums were drowned in hate and whine, so that information did not reach many eyes. At least that's what I think.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kultirans were not in the trailer. They have been announced much later along with Mag’har orcs. They concealed that information, you can already stop defending Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Since then, everyone are treating BFA as an unfinished product still on beta tests till zandalari and kultirans are released XD</div></div><hr />

About on par with Highmountain.<br />
<br />
Say you have 200k health<br />
You get hit with a massive tank buster for 50% life (100k)<br />
You heal 2% of that over 4 seconds<br />
2% of 100K is 2k<br />
2k/4 is 500<br />
<br />
You literally would heal 500 health after a massive hit which is only like 0.25% of your life per second, but most of the time it would be 20-100 heal or basically negligible amounts of healing<br />
<br />
As a healer my heals are hitting 2-45k. It’s a nice bonus but it’s not going to make a huge differwnce</div></div><hr />
