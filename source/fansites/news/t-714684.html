Dude, that link you provided is for 'photo-realistic 3D renderings of golf courses.' Of course it looks better. The Links engine also had the rights to it completely freed, and has been constantly updated by Microsoft employees and enthusiasts since its release. Troll harder prz.<br />

<br />
<br />
First of all, WoW's graphics aren't meant to be as realistic or fantastic as what you're trying to troll. WoW is meant to be a fantasy cartoonish game with the same graphics--every MMO has their own trade to graphics to stand out from the rest.<br />
<br />
The point you're trying to argue isn't even a video game, for crying out loud. If you want to make an analogy on graphics at least use another MMO for comparison.<br />
<br />
The people stating the screenshots are amazing and what not are people who are looking at them from a WoW perspective. These screenshots portray Azeroth in an entirely new light. In my opinion, they're very pretty to see, coming from a WoW perspective. <br />
<br />
Please take your fail trolling elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

those aren't renderings of golf courses they are actual screen shots of courses he designed that are playable in links - here's the link to the main page http://mikejgolfdesign.com/ where it clearly states they are playable courses for links.<br />
<br />
and you're right a few former MS employeees updating a discontinued game have equal resources to blizzard who made a couple million dollars last month alone selling steed.<br />
<br />
But the point is if you're impressed by that screenshot then you have pretty low standards to begin with.<br />
<br />
And those enthuasiasts now produce golf courses for the game with the quality described above. Links has advanced greatly since that screenshot you posted and WoW basically hasn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Something you need to understand is that the people posting here are WoW players. They're not necessarily impressed because it's an &quot;amazing&quot; screenshot as compared to everything in the world. What people are impressed with is how it compares with the current WoW. You need to quit trying to use outside sources, especially non-MMO ones, to prove a useless point. Are they the most amazing images ever? No. Do they look pretty good for WoW? Yes. And that's where the player mind-frames are at. It's a comparison of WoW.</div></div><hr />

and you're right a few former MS employeees updating a discontinued game have equal resources to blizzard who made a couple million dollars last month alone selling steed.<br />
But the point is if you're impressed by that screenshot then you have pretty low standards to begin with.<br />
And those enthuasiasts now produce golf courses for the game with the quality described above. Links has advanced greatly since that screenshot you posted and WoW basically hasn't.<br />
<br />
This is because WoW is still designed to run on the 10 year old brick with the 10 inch CRT monitor. You try and run one of those photorealistic golf courses on your brick. Let me know how that goes, but take your trolling elsewhere until then.</div></div><hr />

Even the Echo Isles preview shots they show had the same ugly ass tree foliage that can be found plastered all over the original continents.<br />
The difference in quality is quite stark, and I'm hoping doesn't become too distracting when existing zones are reshaped to incorporate ares of new design with a lot of the old.</div></div><hr />

The old world will still as crap as it does now. just in between there will be these amazing new zones... im sure it wont ruin your gaming experience to walk from 'built 7 years ago forest' into 'built 7 months ago forest'.</div></div><hr />

Yes but no new art assets, the trees were the old trees, just as in the Swamp of Sorrows pic, it was unchanged in any way...you could go screenshot that same image right now, everything was the same (except the new water, but that is game-wide, all zones, all everything).</div></div><hr />

Not so hot about this one. Current STV coastline with its lush tropical colours looks better IMO. I even prefer the Sholazaar and Strand beaches. Weird clouds. <br />

So you think blizzard is maintaining low system requirements and out-dated graphic quality because they are solely concerned with the welfare of people with limited disposable incomes? This from a company that is imposing a micro-transaction market (blizzard store - in game items) on top of a monthly subscription service.<br />
<br />
The reality is that better graphics would require more effort on blizz's part and much better servers with greater capacity. They aren't really concerned about the ever decreasing % of their player base that has 10 year old bricks especially when the vast majority of these same players play other new games with much higher system requirements than WoW.</div></div><hr />

30p a day the subscription is and the micro-transactions are bought by people who can afford it.<br />
<br />
the servers don't stream the geometry. that's all on your PC.<br />
improved graphics doesn't mean increased server load.<br />
<br />
more than half of WoW customer base is in a single country where the average yearly salary is about 5 grand (adjusted for purchasing power parity)<br />

No I mean it looks different than the changes they have shown us so far. The water in the Blasted Lands screenie looked way different. There was also a video of a beach in STV with the new water and it looked somewhat different than what's shown here. :-\</div></div><hr />

It might be less reflective since maybe the sun is shining from a different angle. same as in RL.<br />
But the water has more detail than before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hahaha! I never thought of that detail :p<br />
<br />
I reckon they'll have some more, more obvious Monkey Island references. They just have to.<br />

Best make a goblin named Threepwood.</div></div><hr />

This from a company that is imposing a micro-transaction market (blizzard store - in game items) on top of a monthly subscription service.<br />
<br />
The reality is that better graphics would require more effort on blizz's part and much better servers with greater capacity. They aren't really concerned about the ever decreasing % of their player base that has 10 year old bricks especially when the vast majority of these same players play other new games with much higher system requirements than WoW. <br />
<br />
You are vastly underestimating the percentage of the playerbase (even the hardcore raiding playerbase) that is still playing on ancient systems or mediocre laptops. VASTLY underestimating.</div></div><hr />

Its the only zone I could think of that would have a coastline that would support the image of palm tree's (at least along its coast). Also note the design of the ship out at sea. Same design used by the Bloodsail Bucanner pirate ships.<br />
<br />
And while you complain about the graphics, they are an improvement over what is currently in game. And yes, I admit to use one of those &quot;10 year old bricks&quot;. I work a minimum wage job that doesn't give me nearly enough hours to pay for gas, food, my subsciption, AND a better computer.</div></div><hr />

It's def. Lost Isles, Blizz said as much in their Twitter feed and if you look at the released screens from BlizzCon, you can actually see this exact spot on the island.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's an answer to that.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is said that in the upcoming expansion, World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, Stranglethorn Vale will be one of the most altered zones. There isn't any more information on this, however.<br />
Stranglethorn Vale is seeing a large amount of changes. - WoWWiki &amp; Cataclysm Panel at Blizzcon (http://www.wowwiki.com/Stranglethorn_Vale)<br />
<br />
+ the Screenshot of the Day is most definitely The Lost Isles.</div></div><hr />

A new Screenshot of the Day has been added to the official site, this is most likely from the Lost Isles (Goblins starting zone) but it could also be any coastal zone in Cataclysm ... <br />

Back in september 2009, before PAX had the pig flu outbreak. At PAX I played the Blizzcon build.. The shown area is the Lost Isles, and from what I remember it was a pretty kick ass zone. Though since then, it might've changed.<br />
<br />
In the blizzcon build, I had to I -think- throw banana grenades at monkeys, kill raptors and collect goblin parts. The banana grenade quest was a blast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, don't forget, that this is just an expansion, it's not a new game. <br />
<br />
They try to improve the graphics here and there (water, higher resolution for textures, maybe some nice effects) - but their main focus is probably on new / improved content like quests and the leveling flow...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The Death Knight starter zone is available to the regular player base. But non DKs see a different &quot;phase&quot; (the one that DKs see once they've completed all the newbies quests).<br />
<br />
It's likely that the goblin and worgen zones will be similar. They will go through multiple phases as they story progresses, and the final phase is the one that all players will see, assuming they have Cataclysm installed.</div></div><hr />

All of the screenshots are being taken by us. Not all areas are finished or ready for viewing, so we're going to really be showing off all of the different areas which are further along in development. We want to display the great variations of looks and feels we have in Cataclysm. (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24630853478/screenshot-of-the-day-revived-for-cataclysm/)</div></div><hr />

i don't know if anyone put this up.. the water in this vid looks more 'word up true that' (pardon my swagga) then in the screenshot &gt;.&gt; maybe the screenie taker didnt have his effects up? hope so.. imo the water in the screenshot lost its' glossy and free flowing qualities and seems more uniformed with default ripples.. what do you guys think?<br />
