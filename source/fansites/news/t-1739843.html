Addon - Premade Filter<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Premade Filter (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/premade-filter) addon. This addon allows you to filter group finder results to just list the groups you are interested in. The author is responsive to feedback in the comments on the addon page (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/premade-filter#comments) and also has a topic on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1672267-AddOn-Premade-Filter?highlight=premade+filter).<br />
<br />
The addon description page has lots of details and the in game UI has some additional help, but here are some of the more helpful features:<br />
<br />
<br />
Set your criteria and search for new groups in the background, with chat notifications.<br />
Tooltips show the number of each class and their role in the group.<br />
Require or exclude specific words in the title or description.<br />
Filter by the number of each role already in the group.<br />
Filter by item level requirement and voice chat. <br />
Filter by specific bosses being dead or alive.<br />
Filter out realms from specific regions.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
People can play RBG's at 2700+ without skype so I think 5v5 objective PvP would work solo/duo Queue if done right <br />
If I ever do an interview, ask me my views on solo queue rated and I'll share them with you. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575833336947478529))<br />
<br />
Heroes and WoW PvP<br />
Masochist tweet of the night: Do you play WoW and Heroes of the Storm but you don't PvP in WoW? I'd love to hear why. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575496853396963328))<br />
<br />
because you can't balance WoW PvP worth anything, man. its no fun mongo training healers<br />
As much as people want to blame balance (and me) many don't get to the point where they could form a proper opinion about it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575501794484355072))<br />
He just did, but you just ignored it because you're more worried about answering soft-balls, like gear differences.<br />
The people I'm talking about are the average WoW player, not someone who has poured hours into arena. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575504632824229888))<br />
It takes a long time playing a game to develop familiarity enough to say &quot;I don't like the balance here.&quot; (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575504768493203456))<br />
I've played World of Warcraft since 2009, Holinka. I've been a competitive PVPer for 3 years. I think I understand.<br />
Right, you have a lot of experience. He's asking the people who *aren't* experienced why they don't. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/575505295612514305))<br />
If you've been a competitive PvPer for 3 years, my original question was not directed at you. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575505032730316800))<br />
Yes, and perhaps the SAME ISSUES that we hate are the reason? It isn't FUN.<br />
We get a lot of feedback from PvPers about PvP. That's awesome, and we continuously work to improve on those issues. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/575506685441142784))<br />
But we don't get as much feedback from people who *don't* PvP at all about why not. It's an interesting topic. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/575507075498950656))<br />
Should probably try acting on the feedback of the people who do PvP first. That would be progress already<br />
We already have a process for that. It just doesn't involve twitter. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575507751599665152))<br />
<br />
I like in Heroes that I can change my character every game, in WoW if I want to PvP as another class I have to level/gear up fully<br />
good feedback thanks (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575501429542023168))<br />
<br />
heroes is more balanced than wow pvp <br />
I know hardcore people will jump on this but I don't think it's the reason for the average player. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575498733405782016))<br />
<br />
respectively and imho it has to do with gear disparity. If you don't get in early, it's frustrating dying so quickly.<br />
it's good feedback thanks (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575498945461358592))<br />
<br />
for me this season felt like a chore to gear up, the obligation to play if you wanna compete can be a drag!<br />
So make it so you can compete without playing the game. Got it! (Just kidding I know what you mean) (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575500953341857793))<br />
<br />
cont...3) I can play multiple characters and not have to level them. 4) No PvE changes that affect PvP. 5) combat is faster<br />
Good feedback thanks (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575502191663845377))<br />
<br />
in pvp, you expect to die. Pvers have a hard time dealing with the paradigm shift.<br />
Understand that...but in this case, the PvP mindset is obviously not the problem, because they play Heroes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/575759515435450368))<br />

New World of Warcraft Short Story: Code of Rule<br />
In the days before the Iron Horde invaded Azeroth and tightened its grip on all Draenor, Warchief Grommash Hellscream sought every advantage in his quest to conquer (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/savage-world/code-of-rule/page-1) the orcish world completely.<br />
<br />
The ogres of Highmaul once ruled Nagrand—and they still exert control over land and sea from their capital. They are massive obstacles to orcish dominance; obstacles that Hellscream himself has a highly personal (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/savage-world/lords-of-war/) stake in removing.<br />
<br />
Faced with the prospect of extinction before a growing Iron Horde, the Sorcerer King of the ogres, Imperator Mar’gok, plots to ensure Highmaul’s survival at any price. But what can Mar’gok offer those who so eagerly seek his people’s demise?<br />
<br />

There was an early version of it in the previous raid finder tool, and many of the group organizer addons (like oQueue) had pretty sophisticated filters and settings for raid leaders and raiders seeking to join a group.

<br />
He is, and if he thinks pvp is fine and its getting better.. he's playing another game or hes blind.<br />
No matter if you are casual or a multiglad, EVERYONE is really bored and tired of the same excuses for all this years.<br />
<br />
WoW pvp is boring. Most of us are tired of trying with the feedback and constructive posts (they do LAZY things like 10% less damage trying to solve the problem.. they don't even know what the real issue is lol or they are really lazy and don't care /facepalm). Great players are quitting because of that (people that truly know the game and want to help with positive feedback).. and the ones that keep playing its because they stream the game and now its their job. Most of them are even playing pve for that reason.<br />
<br />
But as always i'm wasting my time talking about things nobody cares haha.<br />
Have a great day guys :D</div></div><hr />

It's true though or at least not wrong. He was asking why people who don't do PVP don't do PVP. The answer to that is not a universal &quot;because balance&quot;*:<br />
- I know a guy who doesn't, because he's playing WoW on a potato and can't do twitchy gameplay at 15 FPS.<br />
- My gf for instance is terribly afraid of making a fool of herself and won't PvP where she might meet players who might flame her for her performance.<br />
- And I don't like PvP in WoW because that ridiculous Red Vs Blue notion in the face of global armageddon and weird players carrying out of the game too. Nothing I want to support.<br />
<br />
<br />
* The truly average player (remember, according to the bell curve MMO posted a few months back, the average player has like 7k achievement points and 1/5th of a legendary cloak) doesn't care about balance. He doesn't even know what balance is. He'd also take his &quot;subpar&quot; spec into PVE and think nothing of it, because that's the class and spec he enjoys.</div></div><hr />

He is 100% right though.<br />
<br />
The average player does not give a flying fuck that PvP is not 100% balanced.<br />
<br />
It is only the hardcore (and the people that like to rage on MMO-C) that do.<br />
<br />
I play arena very casually once a week and have a lot of fun.<br />
<br />
I get wtf p0wned by certain combos, I don't come to MMO-C and rage about it.<br />
<br />
PvP in a game like WoW will never ever be balanced, there are to many moving parts.<br />
<br />
PvP in a game like Starcraft or HotS have way way more chance there are less moving parts (less gear, less ability's etc etc).<br />
<br />

<br />
That average player will quit as soon as they get stomped on in PvP. Gear and balance do definitely matter.<br />
<br />
Most people will probably end up doing battlegrounds when they start with PvP. And battlegrounds are just horrible. Not only is it unbalanced all over, because of classes and the huge gear differences, but it is also filled with bots.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And for me, as an experience player, it is simply not worth the effort anymore. Gearing up has never been this fast and easy but it's just boring as hell.<br />
If I could just step into arena and be competitive I would at least do some matches and if I then have fun I would continue to play. But to have any chance at all I need to grind boring content. It's basically the same in PvE now, I can't be arsed to go through LFR, pugs and weekly boring pinata worldbosses and then find an appropiate guild (which most likely requires me to pay for a realm transfer) just to do a raid difficulty I like to do. I've tried it once and it burned me out in just two months.<br />
<br />
To me it's just like some wall of boring tasks to get to the fun stuff. There are just too many obstacles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sure, everyone just loves to lose and sometimes have no chance to win at all. It's just plain horrible design when you have combos who can't die or zerg down players in 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
We are not talking about 100% balance. We are talking about reasonable balance so people can have fun.<br />
<br />

I'm wondering what an average player really is. If I start playing a new game and I get owned over and over because I picked a certain class I want to play and/or didn't obtain massive amounts of gear I'm done rather quick. I guess that means I am not average?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think so too.<br />
The answer for a lot of classes is simple: In Heroes you got the feeling that you can fight 1on1 or at least run for npc-help if you pay attention to what is going on around you. Even if you can't face someone 1on1 right now you likely could 1 minute ago or can in 1 minute. In WoW 1on1 is not balanced at all and if you hit on a strong 1vs1 class then you are toast no matter what you do(and you usually can't run either)...and you have been for the last 2 weeks and will still be in 2 weeks(cause the balance is so screwed that even moderate equippment differences don't make a serious change). <br />
I think running back to your corpse or respawning feels more annoying in WoW too(what you can do while dead and how long it needs to get back into fight is generally something Blizz should take a look into).<br />
<br />
In Heroes PvP feels much more strategic cause you have limited abilities(compare that to what a shadow can and has to do during an arena match. Granted, there are 4 button classes in wow too...that again is a balance issue)...and you don't have camera issues(line of sight for the player).</div></div><hr />

<br />
same, im also fine with it being imbalanced, it will never be reasonably fine (it has never happened in wow history, especially PvE+PvP balance combined is impossible). On every patch we had/have someone godlike and someone totally useless. Im playing since 2006 and honestly? Game is in really good shape when it comes to PvE balance, maybe at a cost of bad PvP i dont know, but outside of mythic raiding which is just few % of people every spec and class is playable.<br />
<br />
I do PvP only from time to time, slowly working on my 5k draenor kills in Ashran, some battlegrounds once in a while. I think i am a definition of an average player and Blizz is right, i dont give a flying crap about these imbalances :D</div></div><hr />

It's just plain horrible design when you have combos who can't die or zerg down players in 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
We are not talking about 100% balance. We are talking about reasonable balance so people can have fun.<br />

I am very average at arena (only just restarted since TBC was 1800 then) I never fell I have no chance to win at all and I have never been zerged down in 2 seconds, and never found a combo that I can't beat a good combo played badly is beatable.<br />
<br />
Does a good combo played well beat an average player in a bad combo for sure it does most of the time, but this will never ever be balance in an MMO there are way way way to many moving parts.<br />
<br />
At 2200 are certain combos better, 100% for sure.<br />
<br />
But you know none of that is average right? That is 100% the hardcore he is talking about.<br />
<br />
If you queue up in arena the chance of you getting owned over and over again is unlikely imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. LRF groups on maidens are averaging 640something ilvl the turrets took way to long to kills as the raid leaders had to /rw every time one has dropped which was usually when the previous one was killed. It became a wipe fest and the problem with that is people vote with their feet. LFR queue times for wing 3 doubled in one week because the fight was overtuned for LFR...or at least perceived that way. <br />
LFR is loot pinata but the loot is fairly rubbish in ilevel and itemization to compensate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most people will probably end up doing battlegrounds when they start with PvP. And battlegrounds are just horrible. Not only is it unbalanced all over, because of classes and the huge gear differences, but it is also filled with bots.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And for me, as an experience player, it is simply not worth the effort anymore. Gearing up has never been this fast and easy but it's just boring as hell.<br />
If I could just step into arena and be competitive I would at least do some matches and if I then have fun I would continue to play. But to have any chance at all I need to grind boring content. It's basically the same in PvE now, I can't be arsed to go through LFR, pugs and weekly boring pinata worldbosses and then find an appropiate guild (which most likely requires me to pay for a realm transfer) just to do a raid difficulty I like to do. I've tried it once and it burned me out in just two months.<br />
<br />
To me it's just like some wall of boring tasks to get to the fun stuff. There are just too many obstacles.<br />
<br />
Getting bored in two months for just joining a guild tells a lot about it... don't think this game specifically is for you... you want some kind of arcade/console multiplayer-solo oriented game. There are some mmos out there that could do it for you, but WoW is not one of them.<br />
<br />
Also, ppl always said to others crying that gearing should be easy and fast, that LFR/World Bosses should be boring (easy and fast) pinatas, etc., would be as boring or even worse. It is true... everything that is way too easy, gets boring really fast.</div></div><hr />

ye but this nerf is not addresing melee geting 2 shot if turret spawns in them in lfr so i give them max 2 weeks before they nerf turrets again this time in dmg.</div></div><hr />

In WoD thus far LFR has been a cakewalk, but Maidens was incredibly difficult. (Note: I am meaning in comparison with the rest of LFR this expansion, not just the fight by itself. LFR is still easy, I know.) I queued up the first week that wing became available and my group wiped 5 times on it. Which is 5 times more than I've wiped on anything in LFR this expansion. I just had figured that LFR was going to remove at least one of the mechanics on Maidens; probably the boat. It's a surprising amount of coordination required for an LFR fight. Most people just want to get in and out, and the Maidens fight does not facilitate that as it is. Luckily I don't need to actually do LFR on my main for gear so I don't have to suffer that weekly, and I'm definitely not bothering to do LFR on my alts (namely that wing) for quite some time, because that was painful.</div></div><hr />

Do you think it would be better if everyone's gear scaled to something so that gearwise everyone is equal? And honor points and such are used to by no-stat transmog stuff to show off cool looking PVP themed gear?</div></div><hr />

What's worse is the senior PVP designer, who undoubtedly had to have extensive experience as a PvP player as well as designer, has to ask his customers why they PvP. <br />

You mean, you don't know? And it's your job?<br />

And, shouldn't he be asking that BEFORE using an expansion's entire PvP budget to design a PvP zone? <br />

Somewhat ironic, almost amusing, if it wasn't so sad. Most of those little QA demonstrate very clearly that these people do not play their own game. All they would be, given limited hours is an 'average player' with direct insight to how a lot of us feel. But that solution seems beyond Blizzard's comprehension. <br />
<br />
Make a toon, a premade level 100 equipped with quest greens and blues and spend 2 days pvping. You will know exactly why a lot of us do not pvp. Further, do that for ever class/spec combo. Here, entry balancing problems exposed on a tray. Now repeat the process on full conquest premade toons. Surprise! Another tray full of tips and highlights of the problems with the system. I assume there is more then one person in the pvp team. Have each pick a class or two they are familiar with the most, devote couple of days to both bgs and arenas and voila. Note your observations, make a list, trigger a community discussion on your perceived problems. Give it a week, filter through feedback. Get to work.<br />
<br />
We realize any changes won't be instant. Pretty sure people would quite happily wait for awesome pvp in next expansion - given it's been thought through and the current system, with all it's faults, properly understood, dissected and improved or just plan redesigned.</div></div><hr />

PvP in a game like WoW will never ever be balanced, there are to many moving parts.<br />

PvP in a game like Starcraft or HotS have way way more chance there are less moving parts (less gear, less ability's etc etc).<br />
