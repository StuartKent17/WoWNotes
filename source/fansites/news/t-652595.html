Algalon Loot Table Update<br />
Two new items from Algalon were discovered on the taiwanese site Wowbox.tw (http://us.wowbox.tw/) (from Stars kill a few days ago (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=62821.0)) and have been added to the loot table, it's probably almost complete now. <br />

<br />
Except I doubt he missed a single auto attack from moving. Its not his fault you can't max DPS and move at the same time :/<br />
<br />
I find moving around while DPSing is actually better for most fights. Anytime your target is moved I find it much easier to adjust if you are already moving rather than standing still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its Knock Knock Knock, just when you do 3 elders, but havent done 2 or 1 elders, on your screen will show the lowest one. Same goes for Sarth3D and Yogg keepers.<br />
<br />
I.E. they had done 1 elder before, but not 2 so thus only 2 showed up on screen, but if you check his chat log, 3 keepers is shown as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They killed all the gifts (if thats what your referring to) just it isn't noticeable since only the ranged are killing it. (you can see a hunter pet on it and arrows flying towards it later in the fight).<br />
<br />
Also, they are using wound poison which goes miles when trying to burst her.</div></div><hr />

Like someone did with the warrior. They did not made 7k dps exclusively on boss, it is covered with all the mobs around, increasing the dps numbers.<br />
If tank did 1.7k dps only with aoe abilities, my guess is: its only necessary something around 4k dps on boss exclusively.<br />

<br />
i have also done that math for this on 25man and i got it to 5.5k dps with 20 dpsers and 130sek to kill her (2 full add wave spwans) so it is doabal on 25 man aswell you just need good ppl and some luck<br />

and in regards to geting rng yes the getting the 3 adds on the first spwan is not going to work for you but bomblings and guardian will both work for you so the rng is in your favor</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a 1:40 second fight. These bursts are where classes like Ret Paladins shine; they have enough time to pop their wings and get maximum benefit out of it + Bloodlust + Speed Potion, while many other classes in that group, while accomplishing the zerg, just get better up to a longer fight length. Also since it's a melee group coincidental AOE takes care of almost all the roots; I know even on our regular 3-Tree kills if she pops a roots next to me (or even on me) just the Divine Storm/Consecration/Unholy Blight/Pestilence + Diseases/etc. flying around usually kill it instantly. <br />
<br />
But anyways, gj on the zerg.</div></div><hr />

Nelle from &lt;Borked&gt;, Eu-Ravencrest did that. We used to optimize raid stacking to compete for fastest kils. Scoreboard was a nice website that parsed the fastest kills on all wws reports on a daily base to give a ranking on guilds, players, classes. (http://www.wwsscoreboard.com/ is no more, so all the reports are gone).<br />

He had pretty much all BiS items and yes that was pre 3.0. most likely around july/aug 2008.</div></div><hr />

Freya heals 6k a second, with 150 stacks it is 36k a second.<br />
<br />
With Mortal Strike Debuff it is 18k per second.. Which means 41k dps on Freya, or so, gives them 23k dps total. That is enough for a boss with only 1.4 mil health.<br />

The problem is the RNG of getting the Trio last. <br />

If what someone posted earlier is true (only 5.5k dps each to make this work on 25m). You might see a huge nerf soon.<br />

Highest DPS on Brutallus was Munken with 3.3k (?) w/o the legendary bow. I know that Nelle had the legendary bow but didnt knew about the 4k dps. <br />

I believe you can open up the dps meter and see 1 hunter was killing gifts and the rogue was killing strengthened iron roots. Why comment if you have no idea what those are?<br />

Stabbindrake - 97% (623k) on Freya , 2% (15k) Strengthened Iron Roots.<br />

Uhh, nobody was confused as to why the caster had low DPS in a melee heavy group. Everybody was laughing at the thought of bringing a caster to the group. I guess that went over your head.</div></div><hr />

In some cases people are taking this video the wrong way. This wasn't some elaborately planned execution or a showcase of uber hardcore players lol we just wanted to see if it could be done. It was a joke really, someone on vent jokingly said &quot;we should just zerg this shiz&quot;. After doing the math, it appeared it could be done. The shaman you see in there is actually an alt that we brought in just for the BL, if that tells you anything.<br />
<br />
We made a fun video to watch.<br />
<br />
It cought on, and drove a lot of traffic to our site. As a result maybe we'll see some good apps.<br />
<br />
THE END.</div></div><hr />

Confirmed. Tried it and got conservator first and around the second wave came, she was barely under to 95%. Says 600% from the 150% tooltip but feels like much more. Touch of Eonar still says 6000 healing over time.<br />
<br />
She still awards 4 Emblems of Valor for Knock x3.<br />
<br />
/shrug. We found out how easy it is even without the zerg.</div></div><hr />

A 10-man rag-tag group of numpties from my guild also did the &quot;Freya zerg&quot; on the same day as the original zerg (I am sure someone caught it on MMO-Champion or elsewhere and wondered how hard it could be...), and it certainly didn't require insane dps by any stretch of the imagination - I think this is likely a bug in encounter design that will be (or possibly already has been) fixed in due course.<br />
<br />
As for the poor little caster in your melee-heavy group: shame on you, you heartless barstiches! ;-)</div></div><hr />

Indeed, was just about to post it:<br />

Thats why my dps is so inflated. My dps on the boss was 1800-something. Running with 1 healer I didn't try any dps gear at all, keeping dodge in the 30%+ range.<br />
<br />
Our poor warlock... we are still teasing her about this hehe. Shes typically one of our top dps in 25's, and a good candidate for vigilance. Being a novelty kill anyway, and not even an all that difficult one to begin with, there was no point in trying to find a mele to take her spot. Its all in good fun!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Technik</div><div class="date">2009-06-17, 01:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">another encounter just zerg'd at last....<br />
<br />
seriously blizz:<br />
<br />
less stamina on pve-gear<br />
less damage <br />
less heal<br />
<br />
<br />
that would help in both pvp and pve...<br />
but oh wait it's your plan to dumb down everything.<br />
encounters stay nicely tuned for ~2 weeks and then get nerfed into crippled, helpless creatures so <br />
Dárkàrthàslol Jenkins surely gets his well deserved epics he can go into the arena with to play World-of-Counter-Strike-with-aimbot<br />
<br />
especially damage and healing are way out of control.<br />
7k dps....do you remember the highest dps in sunwell before they gave us wotlk talents? damage has more than trippled and we're only at the second tier of gear in this expansion...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you lower the stats you just mentioned, no-one would be killing anything in Ulduar. Unless you meant they were all reduced by 1%. Think we could handle a 1% &quot;nerf&quot; to all our stats ;)</div></div><hr />
