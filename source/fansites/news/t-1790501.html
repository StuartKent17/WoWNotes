<br />
I am close to exalted with the Goblin faction in Nagrand, yet each time I remember just how uninteresting I find their faction mount to be...a boar...if only they had made an updated model of the Azerothian Boar or Outland boars with that kind of run animation and REAL legs that don't look like twigs!</div></div><hr />

Me too! I like the boar models, and the riverbeasts are ok (not my kind of thing) but they just have the most dreadful running animations. I can't stand them. Such as same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The transmog sets are not faction rewards, they are given via war mill, they tweeted that there was no offical plans at time of when or where to incorporate them but they tweeted that they did intend to bring them along at some point. Most likely was a mix up somewhere along lines and something got miscommunicated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well the thing is the Wolf Helmet they're wearing is typically their dead companion wolf.<br />
<br />
Basically there's new Rep factions in place in Tanaan:<br />
<br />
Order of the Awakened ~ Arakkoa<br />
Hand of the Prophet/Vol'jin's Headhunters ~ Faction rep<br />
Saberstalkers ~ Saberon<br />
<br />
The Transmog set is restricted to classes, but there's a Toy version that can give a temporary appearance of the same.</div></div><hr />

We don't grow weaker either, so why would we even care about some &quot;warlords&quot; we could've steamrolled the second we came into Draenor.<br />
<br />
Or we could think less serious about it and just enjoy a possible great bossfight :p<br />

Can we stop the circlejerking already? They add three new factions to the game, two of which contains highly desired transmog sets, all three also comes with potentially nice tabards and they all also probably have more rewards than this.<br />
<br />
At this point no matter what they add, you people will bash it.<br />
<br />
I agree that they shot themselves in the foot with the recent interviews, lack of feedback and what feels like stonewalling the community, but complain about real issues, not the fact that we're getting these awesome sets for transmog and so forth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The patch looks okay but not liking the boatyard, so we get more windows to click on your alts and waste even more time than we already do at our garrison. It's bad enough as it is why make it even worse? It's fine if you have a couple of characters but once you have over 20+ lvl100 with garrisons it turns into one helluva chore.<br />
<br />
My only complaint about the new &quot;factions&quot; is that they're obviously going to take yet another shortcut and just go back to ancient mmo-days by grinding your way through mobs to climb the reputation ladder. Bring back the dailies... I'm honestly not even going to bother grinding out the factions by kill a few million mobs, the most important things are already tradable so that's the only saving grace.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you consider that we (those 20 heroes) are far ahead of that time in our timeline, then yes, we are ridiculously stronger than the original armies and wisps who beat that Archimonde....<br />
<br />
And since he is from this alternate timeline, where he's at the same power he had at that time, then we do need less people to deal with him now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure, a mount already used to death this expansion being recolored is totally a &quot;new&quot; mount...blind people gonna be blind I suppose. A NEW mount would be the Runesaber, but that one was put on the store. They could've made use of the Ravagers, Rylaks, HYDRAS, but no...better and cheaper to recolor the same few mounts over and over. Apologists will keep defending Blizzard until they turn WoW into a p2w Facebook game though.

I haven't played in the PTR to see if it's been added in the mount journal yet but I would imagine it will be red and black like the old helboars from Hellfire Peninsula. Also doubt it will be green since it isn't listed as 'fel' something or other.</div></div><hr />

I have always wanted one of the hellfire boars since tbc :) , I still feel like somethings missing from the rewards... they should make it so that the new seals are rewarded for 10k crystals or something that dont count towards the cap and some sort of world pvp inventives similar to the bloody coin... &quot;drink a small amount of fel blood turning you against everyone&quot; with a fel version of some mount you know theyd reskin but fuck it would still be something cool imo</div></div><hr />

Can we stop the circlejerking already? They add three new factions to the game, two of which contains highly desired transmog sets, all three also comes with potentially nice tabards and they all also probably have more rewards than this.<br />
<br />
At this point no matter what they add, you people will bash it.<br />
<br />
I agree that they shot themselves in the foot with the recent interviews, lack of feedback and what feels like stonewalling the community, but complain about real issues, not the fact that we're getting these awesome sets for transmog and so forth.<br />
<br />
It's not circlejerking. I love parts of WoD. What I don't love is the reputation grind system.<br />
<br />
All these new toys and reasons to do factions are great, sure, but it means little if the only way to get reputation is similar to the other reputations in WoD so far. People didn't like when they made PvP a requirement for the Legendary cloak in MoP, people wouldn't like it if they made pet battling mandatory to progress in raiding, and people who had no problem with daily quests won't like it if things they enjoy collecting are behind a gate that requires a bunch of investment into activities they stopped having to force themselves through when TBC's first patch came out.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with the content they are adding, it's the presentation and structure.</div></div><hr />
