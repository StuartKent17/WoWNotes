TwentyFifthNovember, the guild created by members from both Nihilum (http://www.nihilum.eu) and SK-Gaming (http://www.sk-gaming.com) is now officialy known as Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com). We'll probably hear about them again in a few weeks/months after the release of Patch 3.1 introducing the new Ulduar raid instance. <br />
<br />
Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com/?p=1) is a joint effort by members of two of the top guilds in World of Warcraft, with the support and endorsement of a private entity based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Our guilds have made being at the forefront of PVE progression our modus operandi since the first installment of this game and, as Ensidia, we will continue to do so.<br />
<br />
In addition, within the week, we will launch a guild web portal that will:<br />
<br />
Be the hub for our guild members and likeminded folk.<br />
Provide for the sizable hardcore/moderate population in our community.<br />
Evolve to fit the complex tastes and needs of the WoW community in general.<br />

World firsts were a lot more exciting and interesting when it was a bunch of dedicated players and guilds actually competing with each other. This is like the Yankees winning the world series with a 250 million dollar payroll, then combining with the Red Sox and winning again. These guys basically have a monopoly on this stuff now and it isn't particularly interesting to hear about anymore.</div></div><hr />

And im deeply disapointed with Blizzard for essentially creating this situation, not too mention a total loss of respect for Kungen and members of Ensidia. They are sell outs imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Correction, this isnt a bad time for WoW PvE, this is mearly complete and utter cluster fuck to those that like to compete (or watch the top guilds compete) to see who was best at PvE.<br />
PvE itself is fine, the way the &quot;best guild&quot; has taken an approach to it is the piss take.<br />
<br />
I for one am actualy going to miis SK-Gaming and Nihilum mearly as it was nice to see some competition at the top, now its just boring as one guild just face rolls the content thinking there imba (wich by deffinition they are....sadly) but realy in the eyes of most decent people/players they are sell outs and elitest jerks, gratz for them but i realy couldnt care so please stop the posts on the front page =/ ;D</div></div><hr />

I think it's cool that some people get paid to do what they want to do. Am I jealous? Maybe a bit, considering that I'm a Ph.D who'll probably make less. :)<br />

exactly SOME of the best guilds, yes watching some of the best guilds compete is fun, but when those &quot;Best Guilds&quot; merge just so they no longer have to compete with each other so they can make more money then and only then do people loose interest and generaly start to get bored of the constant spam about how awsome this guild is =/ ;D</div></div><hr />

Exactly my thoughts.<br />
<br />
[14:28] MMO-Champ: Ulduar has been released!<br />
[14:29] MMO-Champ: Ulduar cleared by Ensidia!<br />

Damnit, I was really cheering for.... uhm ... no never mind, what else is new?</div></div><hr />

<br />
is NOT meant to be unachievable task<br />
<br />
as a (hobbyst) game dev, i know that blizzard spend a great deal of time to make pve batles fun ,epic and acessible to any wow player, thats completely unrelated to difficulty<br />
if someone menaged to do pve content, only means part of blizzard job is done right (in fact what we should worry about was if by now no one had cleared it)<br />
<br />
also if someone's guild killed arthas or whatever is of no concern to me except curiosity and dont really affect me or any other wow player in any way. <br />
if someguy in dubai finances a wow guild, that does things that are BY DESIGN are meant to be done, then either something is very wrong with him or with the world<br />
<br />
and i really have no idea why this &quot;news&quot; item is actualy worth mention at all</div></div><hr />

<br />
i really have no idea why this &quot;news&quot; item is actualy worth mention at all<br />
2nd'ed<br />

<br />
its an amazing world how people can make money for playing wow.. i mean ad's on a high traffic website i get.. but being able to log when servers come up so you can slay npc's that you practiced on for weeks on ptr... right ... that doesnt make sense...get a real job<br />
<br />
<br />
its not even a feat.. as soon as our server got 25 people done with 80 lvl grind done they cleared it all same night as well and it was largely pug raid as well.. srsly nobody cares.. report when they add in the dual spec thing or make things harder...<br />
<br />
<br />
ps: the new name sucks.. way to name your uber leet guild after a online postage company.. gj nubs<br />

<br />
As far as PVE being easy. I agree with the dev that posted earlier. Games are meant to be played, not worked on. If you don't like it, stop playing the game. Go be an elitist jerk off somewhere else. More people are joining for the casual playstyle.<br />

If your not playing games to have fun, then you have a problem, seek help.</div></div><hr />

It's like Blizzard dev's/QC team coming out and saying 'we're at the forefront of Warcraft raiding....and trust us, we know. We made it and have been playing it for months.'<br />
<br />
There was a blue post moaning about 'we have more tools to test classes and raids then people think outside of Beta' etc....so let's be done with this new idea of having guilds clear content on Beta. Test it in-house and stop taking the shine off new content....it's counter productive.<br />
<br />
People are sick of seeing a new raid instance pulled apart, strats already online and videos posted before they have even had the opportunity to install the patch/expansion.</div></div><hr />

As much as &quot;ensiada&quot; (doesnt deserve to be spelled right) (and horrible name btw, lets just call the guild jihad now) would like to think they have influence in the warcraft community, they don't. Glad others are finally seeing this &quot;news&quot; as the load of bull that it is. Its like paying a group of guys to watch a movie that they have already memorized line for line and then expect people to treat them as celebrities when they post about it on the internets.

I also find it interesting to see people writing things like 'they make more money than I ever will!'. I am fairly confident that they do not, they have employment that allows them to take time off for a bloody stupid reason. Sponsorship is a measure of revenue generated through the sponsor, and Nihilum don't make any.<br />

Hell if anything they attract more and more negative publicity as they keep pushing themselves as internet gods. If they wanted a real challenge they'd play a genuinley 'hardcore' game like Final Fantasy 11</div></div><hr />

Anyone can learn to clear content like they do, its not hard, it depends on how much time you want to spend on it. They play at the level of being able to stop real life based on events in an online game. If everyone could do that then Im sure they would have competition and actually be worth reading about. I'd rather hear about Michael Jordan playing basketball against toddlers so we can know how leet he is.</div></div><hr />

I mean, why should it be Fail of the Lich King just because a handful of people finished the raid content so soon?<br />
I'm playing the game, not yet 80 with any of my chars, and I'm enjoying it very much. More than the Burning Crusade probably, because the new areas are better, in my opinion. And frankly, I don't give a crap about hard core raider's opinions about how much of a fail is the game for them.<br />
You got all the new bosses down? Cool, hope I'll do that too, but it's not like I'm in a rush. The game is out from just 10 days? Well, that means I have a lot of time to see everything I want, right?<br />

Those jerks should move on to another game, by the way, I am very certain that the amounts of players enjoying WotLK as it is, is a lot greater than the very few elitist whiners who have cleared all content already. Suit yourselves, it's you own fault you rush through content, and hopefully (Oh please, god, please!) Blizzard won't start catering these stuck up elitist players just because they start ranting on their website.<br />
<br />
The following quote is pretty precise to what I feel...<br />
<br />
Reading what's written on their new website, like the &quot;it could be the Fail of the Lich King&quot; statement, kinda makes me believe that they think they are better than Blizzard itself now. I mean, why should it be Fail of the Lich King just because a handful of people finished the raid content so soon?<br />
[...]And frankly, I don't give a crap about hard core raider's opinions about how much of a fail is the game for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't care if it's on the front page, it doesn't really interest me but I can see allot of people give this whole &quot;best guild topic&quot; allot of attention. I only care about my game, whatever they do is not important to me. <br />
<br />
What does bother me is people saying things like: &quot;It's terrible for pve, stupid how Blizzard created this situation&quot;. Another example is a bunch of people crying out about how easy the endgame is now while so far no guild except Ensidia has reported that they cleared the endgame content. So as far as i'm concerned, nobody of the 11 milion people playing actually finnished with endgame except those 100 hardcore raiders. I'd say shut up and play your game, it's fine to discuss stuff like this and be amazed about who elite they are but if you're not at the same point you have absolutely no right of whining about how easy they found the endgame to be. Go play the game instead of minding how others do it imho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is all very hyped isn't it. First they tell us Nihilum and SK Gaming merged, which in itself was a very sad day for WoW. They promised us something big on 25 November, check the site then. So we do, and it's just another name change and a bit of a rant. We're told to check the site again in the future. I might not bother.<br />
<br />
I wish them all the best but I fear they're killing the spirit of what they had and they're killing the only enjoyment they'll get from the game. Personally I'm rooting for Last Resort now. Oh how it would tickle me to see some smaller guild down the main boss before these guys. It would destroy their worlds. If they're not careful, someone will gather together players to do just that to them to prove a point, that they're not the best. Now that would be a bad PR day, wouldn't it?</div></div><hr />

I mean, how big of an idiot you must be to come over all elite and cool by saying its too easy.<br />
<br />
No, its too easy for what 1-2% of player base who achieved worlds first since launch of WoW and been on the beta (read: knowing the bosses). For all the rest they wont clear the bosses in 1-2-3 weeks after launch.<br />
<br />
So expressing your so called concerns is actually completely pointless cause their opinion isn't valid if you ask me.<br />

EDIT: The fact that they are now sponsored by an oil company and a company from Dubai is just so strange to associate those 2 with a video game. I really don't get it lol.</div></div><hr />

Explain to me exactly how they're &quot;better&quot; than anyone? Because it's THAT attitude that's got them so big-headed in the first place. It's absolutely fucking pretentious.<br />
<br />
Because they cleared the same content faster than people who'd rather ENJOY the in-betweens?<br />
<br />
I don't care how fast they are, what gear they're in, how well they know their class, or what bullshit they spout on their website. They're not &quot;better&quot; than anybody else who can work to the same ends on a different schedule. They're not even better than some casuals that would rather not push that hard. I've known more than a handful of people that are damn good at their class, who don't treat this game like a race.<br />
<br />
Faster doesn't mean better. Faster is an illusion, and it's about time some of you realized that.<br />
<br />
Edit: And, no, this isn't WoW news. Patches are WoW news. Events are WoW news. Class changes are WoW news. This? This is guild news, and has absolutely no effect on WoW as a whole. Go away.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Learn't&quot; the bosses faster than anybody else? Bosses from vanilla WoW? Grats to them. They've had plenty of time. As for the other two, well, it's not like they weren't attempted on beta. Hell, it's not like most of THEM weren't in beta.<br />
<br />
And way to entirely miss my point. Being faster doesn't mean being better. That's rushing. Had they taken their time, they would have had some...you know, competition? They only raced so they would be first - they practically guaranteed it for themselves, and it's pathetic.<br />
<br />
One last thing: When did I say no one cares about this? All I said was that this is NOT WoW news. This is guild news, and it doesn't effect the rest of the game in the least.<br />
<br />
Learn to form an argument and read what you're replying to. You're fucking pathetic.</div></div><hr />

They learnt WotLK bosses purely because blizzard automatically invited them to Beta so they had the chance to &quot;tune&quot; the raids for the playing world, meaning technicaly they had a huge advantage over everyone else as they where the only two entire GUILDS invited to beta.<br />
<br />
When new unseen content is released after everyone has the same gear level i would just love to see a backwater tiny guild shine through and beat them, but untill that day let me say this.<br />
<br />
World Firsts by this guild may be (but only just) News worthy, but every little twitch this guild does is certainly not, if it is you should be reporting about every guild as these guys realy are no special than those other guilds bar the huge amounts of money and supposed fame (although right now it seems the vast majority i fed up with them) =/ ;D</div></div><hr />

Leveling from 70 to 80 and clearing raid content within 3 days of release of a game that would otherwise take an &quot;average&quot; group of 25 raiders about a week, more or less, isn't &quot;their own pace.&quot; It's racing to get an almost 100% head start on what little competition they have left, and that's not exactly a fair fight.</div></div><hr />

Yes, fine, you're right. It's a coincidence that 25 people got paid to level at-their-own-faster-than-anybody-else-pace and finish everything before a lot of people even got to install the game.<br />
<br />
Assumptions. Right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With all this said, I don't think this is frontpage material though. I would rather have it in the &quot;in other news&quot; section, instead of having their dramas and adventures in my face every time I'm looking for genuine news about the actual game.<br />
<br />
I'm never doing raids to compete with the biggest guilds, I do it because I enjoy it and I like to progress with the guild I'm a member of. These guys do it because they are living with the illusion that fame in an online game will make them larger than life at some point.</div></div><hr />

Do you really think Blizzard is scheduling their designs and boss fights after how fast those morons finish their content? You seem to be living in the same disillusioned world they do.<br />

<br />
<br />
If you don't want to read about their progress and loot, dont. No one is forcing you.<br />

I mean, why should it be Fail of the Lich King just because a handful of people finished the raid content so soon?<br />
I'm playing the game, not yet 80 with any of my chars, and I'm enjoying it very much. More than the Burning Crusade probably, because the new areas are better, in my opinion. And frankly, I don't give a crap about hard core raider's opinions about how much of a fail is the game for them.<br />
You got all the new bosses down? Cool, hope I'll do that too, but it's not like I'm in a rush. The game is out from just 10 days? Well, that means I have a lot of time to see everything I want, right?<br />
<br />
Cheers for your success guys, but don't start whining because you did it too fast now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly. Fail of the Lich King? Im having a great time doing the quests. There's so much diversity now, great fun. The storylines behind the quests are much better as well. Then there's the Lich King and Arthas showing up a bunch of times and the great battle of the undercity questline. The zones look great, the classes play great and everything has worked fine so far.</div></div><hr />

I think news about this guild is getting less and less interesting because:<br />
<br />
a: They have merged the two biggest guilds so there is no more &quot;Who will get there first?&quot;<br />

Yes I do think Blizzard are designing boss fights depending on how fast people progress. If they think the game is too hard, they make the next patch bosses slightly easier and vice versa.<br />

When I saw this post on mmo-champion, I was like &quot;Oh they settled on a name, good for them. And got a sponsor too? Nice.&quot;<br />

World firsts were a lot more exciting and interesting when it was a bunch of dedicated players and guilds actually competing with each other. This is like the Yankees winning the world series with a 250 million dollar payroll, then combining with the Red Sox and winning again. These guys basically have a monopoly on this stuff now and it isn't particularly interesting to hear about anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
./signed <br />
<br />
Endgame Content right know is a joke and even if it wasn´t I totally agree with you and the others who don´t care.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think things are gonna get much harder than they are now. Afterall Blizzard said they'd make the game easier so everyone could see all of the content. After almost clearing Naxx in 2 raids and 1 shotting nearly everything, I think this whole Hype is a waste of time, the only way guilds like this will progress before others is by raiding the second the content is released. And then us other hardcore guilds with people who work etc, will come home and clear it that night or day after.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly. The only thing that makes them elite is that they can call gaming a job.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree and disagree with some of you here, this is news. The two biggest raiding guilds in the world merging, face rolling through all the content, changing their name into another (silly) one and thus getting sponsorship from Dubai (?) is all news.

Please stop this. The point is NOT if the content is too easy or too hard, if those guys are jerks or not or whatever.<br />
<br />
The point is the moment they erased competition it's just not interesting anymore. They got a sponsor. Good for them. They act like attention wh...s with the all &quot;we are so important that we must announce the date we will reveal our name&quot; and then they sell it to the highest bidder. Good for them.<br />
<br />
Personally I don't love them or hate them.<br />
<br />
It's just they now faceroll the content with no visible competition it becomes sure as hell tey will do it first, so theres no thrill.<br />
<br />
Just think for a second. Let's suppose one team would win Championships ten years in the row because noone could've stand a chance? Would you watch the games they play?<br />
<br />
Personally I would be more interested in whose actually second than first.<br />

3rd)i dont have a problem reading about them...hell i read more stupid things in newspapers and e-papers so why not...<br />
4th)stop arguing about this game...after u ppl clear it then speak...and if u have negative content pls say them and leave the game..there is no reason to and and play a game that u dont like<br />
5th)dont know about u but lvling and seeing all this storylines in wrath is worth it...so i really dont care if this game is hardcore or not..thorins storyline is hardcore enought :P or the troll chain story in gundrak :P and many many more quest in this game...so just enjoy the game..and remeber ITS A GAME...nothing can change that...in the end of the day when u close you PC for whatever reason...the game ends...and all your e-peen and e-might and e-fame is jsut like that vanish<br />
<br />
ow and for the end...since those people dont mess with my gaming experiece then i dont see any reason to be a hater for them...or a fanboy...for me they are just some more elitist people that because they co-ordinate they hand-eye better than many of us...the are better than us...but on the other hand....most of us got jobs and stuff that we can put aside in order to achieve that hand-eye combination..<br />

<br />
It can't be healthy. Perhaps thats why blizzard made it so easy and so few bosses to start with? To not risk the growing amount of &quot;hardcores&quot; (50hours+ a week when new content hits) to get too unhealthy. Imagine they would have to fight night and day for 2-3 weeks? <br />

Personally just the fact that these people are treating their guild like a company is sad. Maybe it's just me but it's really more of a downer these days as opposed to a &quot;WOW GRATS ON THE FIRST!&quot; moment, considering these guys aren't really a guild but like I said people getting payed by sponsors to get world firsts which I think unless your getting payed to play the game, they have zero competition.</div></div><hr />

Guild clears content while members raise children, go to work, pay the mortgage, wash the car, tidy the house, help the kids with homework etc. etc. = Achievement<br />

<br />
I agree entirely with this. Server firsts was an idea meant to give a bonus reward to people, but in fact it only backfired and created the urge for people to RUSH through content.<br />
<br />
Any freaking guild that clears content within 2 weeks of time has NO right to complain how &quot;fail&quot; or &quot;easy&quot; the whole thing was. <br />

Nilium where the best for a long while but there was alot of guilds close behind <br />

SK-gameing made the effort and proved they could beat Nilium <br />

LK <br />
<br />
we now have what some people belive is a super guild <br />

but there is some guilds close behind <br />
<br />
just to name 1, IS on silivermoon they had a few world 2nd and 3rds in Sunwell.<br />

If the news article doesn't excite you, then just skip it (I'm sure you skip blue posts that don't pertain to your class as well). Now, you may be warranted to complain if the entire focus of the site shifts from one paradigm to another, but MMOC is still posting the same old news with blue posts and such that it did before and still will. So just relax... you'll still get your blue posts and eventually this one will be off the front page entirely.<br />
<br />
Now, sometimes having a grasp on the &quot;higher-end&quot; guilds can be a good thing. Just look at Everquest for example. Some of the members of higher-end guilds on Everquest are actually shaping your current world (of warcraft... sorry, I had to). <br />
<br />
<br />
The fanboys who have Kungen posters on their walls?<br />
<br />
Hey... quit peeping into my room :o!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree entirely with this. Server firsts was an idea meant to give a bonus reward to people, but in fact it only backfired and created the urge for people to RUSH through content.<br />
<br />
People rushed through the content for server firsts regardless of actually receiving a title/FoS for it. The aforementioned bonus may've created more people that were vying for it, but there will always be the few that desire to be first overall (which obviously has no real title or achievement associated with it). Some people just enjoy that facet of MMOs and honestly... with that, how do they ruin our gaming?</div></div><hr />

While he and his parrots (oh and there are many that hang on his lips as if they were the words of Christ) whine about the current state of raiding, they forget several key and very important points.<br />
<br />
1) Raiding has started over.<br />
You are not continuing from Kil'Jaeden. You are starting over in the raiding progression. Every expansion resets the difficulty so that others that are leveling up and haven't seen the content don't have to backtrack through old and stale content just to be able to do something. <br />
<br />
This is a minor and mostly understood point but it bears stating since many people come straight off of the micro that was M'uru and the CF that KJ could be at times and feel &quot;let-down&quot; by how easy some of this content is now.<br />
<br />
2) Key time-sinks and cock-block mechanics have been removed.<br />
In TBC, in order to advance to the true 25man content (SSC &amp; TK), you had to squeeze 25 people through a 10 man, then 3 5mans before you could take them to the 2 25mans to finally get attuned. God help you if you're missing a shaman and you have another one on standby but he never did the SH timed run. It was a massive CF and many people rightly complained to blizzard about it. Blizzard rightfully responded by creating a straight path for the 25man guilds to tread - you can jump right in and start in on content without worrying about flagging 25 people through the most asinine hoops.<br />
<br />
Time sinks are there because they take ... time. (Duh) When you remove them and set people loose on the content right away, content will get cleared much faster. The individual elements of TBC were beated incredibly quickly; karazhan was dead within a week and gruul (broken though he was) and mags were short to follow. What followed thereafter was not the next tier of raiding but the timesinks/cockblocks. No longer.<br />
<br />
3) Naxx is the new Karazhan, not the new SSC/TK<br />
This expands on point 1 a little further; Naxxramas is the introductory raid; the place where you build your raidforce and gear them up; teach them basics if they've never been or just take it easy. Karazhan fulfilled that same role in TBC and it was a phenomenal success in that regard. <br />
<br />
Imagine then if you will if the 10/25 man system was in place for TBC - 25man Karazhan would have still consisted of a tank&amp;spank attumen with more decursers; more tanks for moroes making him essentially an HKM fight; more assigned raidhealing for maiden, ect. Aran would have been fun for 25man - think of all the idiots that didn't move from doomfire ;). Point being that it still would have been easy and just as readily cleared by those who already know how to raid and have their raid synergy already established.<br />
<br />
Naxxramas fulfills that role now; it's a place for taking recruits, for building your raid synergy and to generally get a good feel for raiding. If you come from a well-established guild, this will be easy; if not, now is the chance to build.<br />
<br />
4) Naxx is already well-known by every hardcore raiding team<br />
There is almost nothing blizzard could have done to make naxxramas challenging for the hardcore apart from tuning it in a fashion that would have locked out everyone except for the hardcore. All the encounters are already known; the work in figuring them out already done. It's now just a matter of executing, which is something that is the least of the hardcore's problem.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the naxx mechanics, while new and &quot;revolutionary&quot; for their times have been implemented many times over in other encounters. When people engaged patchwerk for the first time, many were confounded by the idea of a hateful strike and how it worked. Nowadays, patchwerk is simply explained as Gruul w/o shatters. Easy as hell for anyone to grasp. The same goes for most encounters.<br />
<br />
The difficulty in half the encounters comes with its tuning and this is what made sunwell rather difficult. The only really technical fights were Kalecgos/Twins and KJ a distant 3rd. Brutallus &amp; Felmyst were nothing but glorified tank&amp;spanks with alternate elements (move up, move down, collect loot) and M'uru was all about raid micro. Tuning made that instance what it was; not mechanics. Set the tuning lower ala 3.0 and gg casual guilds clearing sunwell in 2 weeks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Woohoo, you've cleared all the content. IMO that's equivalent as winning the special Olympics in terms of bragging rights. The real raiding game does not begin until Ulduar just as it didn't start until people got into SSC/TK. To cry now because it's been cleared so fast is about as foolish as it gets. Wow, you're able to stand still during flame wreath/do the Heigan dance. Have a cookie.<br />
<br />
As for me, I'm enjoying WoW like I've never have before. A truly phenomenal expansion and I'm looking forward to more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few points:<br />
<br />
They did clear the content rather nolifingly fast, but who cares? Its their game, they enjoy power through content. And im sure they all have alts that they can level nice and slow-like and take in the beautiful...scenary?<br />
<br />
I cant speak for Ensidia, but Sk and Nihilum are not 'paid' to sit and play wow. Their website is sponsored, their sponsors pay for bandwith, possibly vent, flights to conventions yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
P.s We are in no way affiliated with “Ensidia Productions LLC (USA). Essentials Tech Ltd. (United Kingdom). Global Energy Technologies Ltd. (Dubai).” &lt;-- keep this in mind before flaming.<br />
<br />
Lastly, sell out? are you mad? If you could have a website ran for your guild, free flights, occaional free hardware, would you NOT sell out?<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR: Its their game, they play wow, this is a wow related website, this is better than no posts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
My thoughts exactly. Let them live it up, if it wasn't them it would be someone else. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile we shouldn't let our accomplishments, whether we are 2 or 5 night a week raiders, be diminished by them when we clearly sacrifice more IRL to beat the same content than they could ever imagine. So we don't kill it 8 hour after the content goes live... Their killing it in 8 hours doesn't make me feel any less accomplished, me and my guild work hard in and out of the game to get where we are.<br />
<br />
<br />
So in short, Grats to Ensidia and goodluck, but at the same time cheers to your average raiders .... us!<br />

<br />
IMO, they are because they joined forces to remain the top guild in order to keep their sponsors. I enjoyed the competition of a handful of guilds racing for the world firsts. This group removed that and they are drama queens to boot. They aren't the same guild they once were. All they do know is play to keep their sponsors. Bring back the end game guilds before sponsors please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Now here's something I don't get... quite a few posts (not saying they are by the quoted author) say that the guild is being pretentious and essentially quite elitist, but isn't believing that you're better because you can balance &quot;the hardships of daily life&quot; and WoW raiding make you just as pretentious as you deem them to be?<br />
<br />
What I don't get is how supposedly them beating content truly ruins your fun. Only one event took place that could only be truly completed by (typically) one person and that's the AQ gate opening. Just because Ensidia or whoever your realms top guild is clears content fast shouldn't ruin it for you. If it does, then you may wish to rethink your stance.<br />
<br />
Now, I can also see why people complain about them complaining (overall, lots of complaining going on :P). But they aren't wrong about the content being easy... even during beta, Blizzard said that they content would be an easier ramp-up than what Karazhan was in The Burning Crusade and they've held by this remark. Also yes, they had time to work on it during beta but as did many other guilds. I played in the WotLK beta and there were plenty of guilds and such that were clearing content. Heck, the premade realm had quite a few PUGs that went and did it all fairly easily.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This expands on point 1 a little further; Naxxramas is the introductory raid; the place where you build your raidforce and gear them up; teach them basics if they've never been or just take it easy. Karazhan fulfilled that same role in TBC and it was a phenomenal success in that regard.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to add in that I do think putting an introductory raid into the game for each expansion was actually a great idea and is something that vanilla WoW sorely missed. Now, I know someone's going to read that remark and say, &quot;but... but... what about ZG!?&quot; Zul'Gurub wasn't introduced until people were already long-since clearing Molten Core and essentially served as &quot;something else to do&quot; while they weren't farming loot or wiping on Razorgore/Vaelastrasz. I remember having to use the crappy gear from Strat, Scholo, UBRS and Dire Maul in MC... *shudder*.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine then if you will if the 10/25 man system was in place for TBC - 25man Karazhan<br />
<br />
To be honest, I don't think I want to even think of the idea of 25-man Karazhan... the instance is too small path-wise and room-wise to truly support that many people. It'd be the raiding concept of a clown car. Well, some rooms would be okay I think, but as an example... Aran? :P<br />
<br />
I think the best part of the 10/25 man system is that you don't have to split your raids anymore. If you're a guild that raids 10-man raids (say you did Karazhan or Zul'Aman a lot in TBC), you can raid 10-mans all the way through Wrath of the Lich King and won't miss out on anything! I've heard some call it the &quot;casual path&quot;, but I don't think raiding with less people necessarily defines you as casual....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not. I'm proud to be working in the environmental field and raising an awesome 3 year old son who has health care (do these guys?). Those are important goals, in my opinion. When I type /played and get &quot;40 days&quot; I feel a little more empty inside. I think I got the high score on an Oceanside Super Streetfighter II machine about 15 years ago?? I honestly think that is where this Ensidia stuff will rank 15 years from now. However, I have newspaper clippings of my name in Surfing magazines for competitions when I was in high school. That's pretty cool. I haven't read an issue in a decade. <br />
<br />
I'm open minded enough to say, &quot;hey, I might be jealous of these guys getting paid to play a video game&quot; and to admit citing having IRL hobbies (and being good at them) is just a defense mechanism. I would like to have that debate. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oldearth</div><div class="date">2008-11-26, 03:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some thoughts:<br />
<br />
a) From the outside, I don't think this is a kid that is trying to get epics. What I think is this is an individual that is trying to do the &quot;yankees + red sox&quot; to put pressure on Blizzard to impact them somehow. It could be something as harmless as bragging rights (&quot;little ol' me made Blizzard scramble and make changes to a popular game&quot;) to something more insidious like this guy holding stock in a different company (Warhammer or w/e) and trying to destabilize Bliz. For the latter, the motivation would be to say &quot;See how easy this game is now? Come to ours&quot; It creates an opening. <br />
<br />
b) I'm not impressed with professional gamers. While it's great MMO-Champion reports on them, in the same respect as Athene, I would like to know who got to 80 first not using gimmicks and which NON-SPONSORED guilds are clearing the contents.<br />
<br />
c) I think this creates an interesting opportunity for a darkhorse (another Dubai guy, a Korean businessman, etc.) to sponsor another guild and race these guys to the top. <br />
<br />
d) It's okay to have an attitude about being awesome at a video game. When you say that the &quot;content is too easy now&quot; and the game is ruined, etc. then you are simply out of touch. Step back from the game and realize that Blizzard is a company, first and foremost. While the people running the show are gamers at heart (benefit of the doubt is given) Blizzard is a FOR PROFIT company and will make decisions based on that. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is the success of the video game, which happens to translate in enjoyability for the largest base. If they lose 15,000 ub3r gamers who left cause they didn't feel challenged, but gain 50,000 more who stuck with it because they got geared up fast... well, you do the math. It's that simple.</div></div><hr />

They should learn, each and every one of them the word &quot;humility&quot;. Everyone is making a huge deal about &quot;first world&quot;, so much, that some &quot;rich kid in dubai&quot; to quote above comment, had to buy players to powerlevel the &quot;first world&quot; guild to kill the big bad guy...<br />
<br />
People don't powerlevel Characters anymore, now they powerlevel a Set of characters, so called Guilds...Crazy world.<br />
<br />
Kungen and such, are just offering powerleveling... achievement &quot;first server&quot;/world, to Arab Emirate thing...<br />
<br />
<br />
This whole topic is nothing more than an advertisement...<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't fucking care of the first worlds... why should you?<br />
<br />
It's just a game...<br />
<br />
<br />
I loled when I read the first topic 2weeks ago about &quot;they are back&quot;, but I'm laughing even more now!<br />
<br />
Good (under)-powerleveling guys!</div></div><hr />

IN BETA! who gives a flying donkey crap what this guild does when it goes live. its not a race. enjoy the game. racing on live after beta clears is not news. its a joke. period. get a life. bragging about a stupid race, about killing something you killed in beta... look in the mirror and see what kind of moronic image the community is seeing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The guys (well at least the two i have corresponded with) are certainly not arrogant from my experience..<br />
<br />
I have sought advice from two players, one from Nihilum, and one from SK Gaming in the past, both times i made level 1 alt on respective server's and asked questions via the in game mail service (post box) :) Both times, i found a polite and constructive response in my mailbox next day (thanks to Ahoq (Nihilum) and Munken (SK))</div></div><hr />
