I mean if they are potentially planning to rely on W3: Reforged's release (meant to be out soonTM) and Classic's next phase to pick up retail's slack, it could mean that they'll be announcing the Next Expansion only at Blizzcon. Also if the rumors of the War Campaign in 8.2.5 being staggered/timegated turn out to be true might add weight to that possibility.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I can think of would be scalling yourself down to 1-60 questing range and doing it with a lower level character in party sync<br />

BFA is going to have 4 seasons. I highly doubt they would do 4th season without a bigger patch and a raid tier with an M+ affix suiting that patch's theme.</div></div><hr />

I think it's pretty big for a patch that doesn't bring any new zones or raids.<br />

<br />
Well for October we'll have the War Campaign, November will be the Anniversary stuff which Blizzard will consider &quot;long-term&quot; content for the month and W3:R will probably release though if not then in December. If they announce the Expansion at Blizzcon, they might open Alpha in late December with intent for Beta in Feb/March alongside Classic Phase Two, pre-patch in June with a large themed event spanning the next two months for a release in August/September.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anniversary raids and quests and old-style Alterac Valley, plus rewards<br />
<br />
Conclusion of War Campaign, variations for two factions<br />
<br />
About 10 minutes of cinematics<br />
<br />
Unknown number of new quests &quot;around the world&quot;<br />
<br />
Party Sync, Recruit-a-Friend rewards and UI and revamped scaling data related to such<br />
<br />
And who knows what else, considering a Blizzard developer is on record as saying they have stuff in this patch that &quot;won't be datamined&quot;.</div></div><hr />

With Partysync you can be grouped by a level 1 char and be scaled to level 60. When you'll quest in a vanilla area, you'll gain XP for your level 60+ so let's say you're 110. When you'll do a level 60 quest with party sync you'll gain 16Kxp which is the usual XP gain for a quest at level 110.<br />
<br />
You only need the guy to be on a true account, and logged in but you can ask for someone leveling in a different region to partysync with you.<br />
<br />
You don't need to be in the area of that guy for partysync to work.</div></div><hr />

They do in BFA. Every Season has a Seasonal Affix that suits current raid tier. All this stuff about no 8.3. comes from recent youtube videos like &quot;BFA CANCELLED&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now some essences like Lens of the Focusing Iris has a requirement for Rank 4: &quot;Season: Season 3 or Later&quot;. To me it suggests that there will be another Season after S3 more than anything else would suggest that there is no patch 8.3.<br />
<br />
Also &quot;We will know who the final boss of Battle for Azeroth is after the events of this raid.&quot; Means we will have at least a tiny (half) tier like Trial of Valor or another full scale raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering they've been rotating seasons every 20 or so weeks this expansion and the next season reset would be around December during 8.2.5 that might not remain the case and I'm not sure that the Reaping Affix &quot;suited&quot; Battle for Daz. It also comes from the fact there's been little mention of an 8.3 patch as of yet.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
As above, Seasons aren't necessarily tied to patches especially as the next one will fall in 8.2.5 unless they're planning to have around a two month long seasonal break or a longer season 3.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also &quot;We will know who the final boss of Battle for Azeroth is after the events of this raid.&quot; Means we will have at least a tiny (half) tier like Trial of Valor or another full scale raid.<br />

This is an unsupported statement made by a single individual who claims to have heard it said by Ion during a Press Summit but has no other corroborating sources from others who attended the same summit. It's very suspect and there's evidence it was only said to give weight to what he read in the dungeon journal whilst previewing the last patch.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kayze</div><div class="date">2019-09-20, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No new build with any of the feedback (since start of PTR) for the Worgen models has been implemented. Wow, Blizzard sure showed us that the concerns they'd just rush these out was 110% valid. The models themselves are the same as Blizzcon's. The time since might have just been adding the HD verisons of their limited customization options.<br />
<br />
Drastic improvement over the current but still not at the bar of the other HD races, with animations that are small edits and removal of some (male ears don't animate on hd models). It's almost like going Cata level on the original races because it would technically still be better than the old models.<br />
<br />
Oh well, at least my boy is prettier now with a better run and casting animation.</div></div><hr />

No, let's be accurate here. Teliesen of Taliesen and Evitel said Ion said it to everyone, at the streamer meetup at Blizzard, when 8.2 was revealed. They were invited with a host of other streamers (Preach lost out on going by getting banned), and they all spoke to and listened to presentations by the WoW team, after playing 8.2. <br />
<br />
You can choose to not believe him, but I've seen no pushback from Blizzard or anyone else that he's lying. He says it in this video:<br />
<br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k_PjunmaAE<br />
<br />
At the 4:00 mark. &quot;When Ion Hazzicostas told US&quot;<br />
<br />
You can minimize this or attempt to hand wave it away, but I've seen nobody accuse Taliesin of lying, from any of the other attendees of that meetup. Feel free to prove me wrong, however.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I remember that. <br />
<br />
It's just that the never-happy-ever-crowd needs to spew the same BS narrative they spew every expansion that they're not enjoying. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, not even WoD was abandoned. What we got = what they were willing and able to give in the time that they had, the cut content was due to corporate scheduling and the good old &quot;1-year expansions lul!&quot;-pipe dream.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to add to this by pointing out that no one was questioning the validity of this statement when we were all waiting to see what the Azshara defeat cinematic would show; so it makes it look even more like this is just trotted out to support that particular talking point.<br />
<br />
On topic, I can't wait to see how they do the war campaign thing and the stuff that wasn't able to be datamined. Plus the new stuff in Stormsong!</div></div><hr />
