<br />
I guess being stuck in the Garrison and not having to go to a town/cross faction area made me oblivious to just how many were leaving, In the past you could notice the drops by how many people were in say stormwind or Dalaran. These days i just login at my Garrison and get a summon to the raid and don't bother with pvp and the only pve i have done was for my flying and that didn't take long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's optimistic. WoD had a lot of hype before launch, I doubt a 10 M sub spike every expac is going to happen, especially after this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be a false economy, if they do get to yearly updates we'd see that peak suffer diminishing returns quicker, and some folks don't want a yearly expansion, that sort of schedule would lead to some players feeling fatigued by the whole thing.</div></div><hr />

Completely agree. At least this is what killed the game for me and my server. Used to have lots of guild with healthy competition. Now most guilds have quit and their players stopped playing.</div></div><hr />

20 man mythic had very little impact considering a large majority of players never even achieve that level of difficulty.</div></div><hr />

That's not really the reason WoW's subscribers is dropping so rapidly. WoW is a massive game and people play it for all kind of reasons. But people only pay for a subscription to get new content, and when the only new content is raiding then all the non-raiders are eventually going to stop subscribing.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully now they will either make the game f2p or stop flooding us with e-shop stuff that taps developer's time from things that could actually go into our already subscription-based game.<br />
<br />
Can't believe people are still saying this nonsense? How your logic makes the leap that one small mount takes away so many resources from the entire game is literally mind numbing.<br />
<br />
It's been explained before how the process works, and how little of an impact it has on the game itself. Please, quit saying stupid shit, which unfortunately fuels the ill informed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Wow is 10 years old , it will only go down and down , I am even surprise they have more then 100k sub after 10 years <br />
<br />
-Blizzard is still printing money and they dont depend on Wow they made lots of money last quarter <br />
<br />
-Blizzard knew this will append with a 10 years old game and nothing they can do will stop the bleeding, anyone in this business know nothing last so all this is already projected.<br />
<br />
If you have Blizzard stock you are kinda happy right now they had an impressive quarter<br />
<br />
My theories<br />
My guess they have another MMO project arround for when Wow get under 1 million subs ( only my guess) I think they even cancel Titan / put on hold because WoW was doing better then they expected after 7 years.<br />
<br />
All in all if you still like Wow play it ( I still do ) 5 millions sub.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tokens still have to be bought by existing players (at a premium of 5$ extra no less)<br />
<br />
It's actually kind of a genius model in hindsight, you make an extra 5$ per token sold, which means you make more money for fewer players; they lost something like 30% of the playerbase, but have a portion of the playerbase paying 30% more. While not a net gain, it certainly mitigates losses.</div></div><hr />

With that said you cannot fan boy this into anything other than it is, essentially 50% sub drop off since launch of WoD. Even for an MMO that is 10 years old that is astronomical and show's the community did not think Blizzard did a good enough job overall.</div></div><hr />

Heroic before WoD = Mythic now. There were a lot more 10 man heroic guilds than 25m. All those 10m guilds died, saying they wouldn't be able to do mythic is just stupid because they were doing it when it was called heroic. My guild died because we couldn't get more than 16ppl to show up consistently, before WoD we were doing 10 man heroic just fine, and would have done just fine in WoD if Mythic wasn't 20m only.</div></div><hr />

Ignore the temporary spike from release and look at the trends. It's simply continuing the trend it would have been without the original spike. Rather than telling us something telling, I'm more concerned about that spike because it was out of character, even for expansion releases.

I mean this in the sense that, new MMOs kept coming out during WoW's lifespan and those same MMO's having died due to WoW's huge size.<br />
<br />
However I can see why this is happening. Unfortunately, WoD had big ambitions but terrible execution. The &quot;Raid or Die&quot; culture has never been more apparent in WoW than ever before. Players have been asking for guild/player housing for ages and then they drop Garrisons. The virtual prison if you will. Considering there was nothing to do other than sit in your Garrison and wait till raid. PVP was left untouched, and nothing of significance has been added.<br />
<br />
WoW has been following the same formula for years with every passing year, the ideas being watered down. But WoD was just... bad. Rep grinding and raiding, that's all there was to do. The Garrisons were just a poor implementation of player housing with limited options. WoW seems to have lost that RPG feel to it.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what Blizzard can do to bring some love back into the game, but in it's current form, it's just an MMO with 2 paths to follow. Level and Raid.</div></div><hr />

No, because they lied about it. People don't like being lied to. What happened when they told the truth? Plenty of people went and cancled their subs. Then the backtracking. No wonder too, they'd probably have 2-3 million if they didnt'.</div></div><hr />

There were a lot more 10 man heroic guilds than 25m. All those 10m guilds died, saying they wouldn't be able to do mythic is just stupid because they were doing it when it was called heroic. My guild died because we couldn't get more than 16ppl to show up consistently, before WoD we were doing 10 man heroic just fine, and would have done just fine in WoD if Mythic wasn't 20m only.<br />
<br />
That's the same with my guild. We were in the server top 2-3 for heroics before WoD. Progressed fine through HM until we hit mythic and couldn't field 20 players. Then people lost interest or got themselves locked pugging and things have fallen apart to the extent that we haven't even managed a single guild raid for HFC.<br />
<br />
Some people use Openraid but most people have just given up and are off playing Hearthstone, Heroes of the Storm or Diablo...<br />
<br />
Fixed 20M mythic is the by far the biggest factor this expansion for us. Flight didn't event come into it.<br />
<br />
Oh, if you want to claim down 5M subs... WoD also saw the biggest rise in subs in WoW history too.</div></div><hr />

This does explain the new strat of one expansion per year, no doubt.<br />
<br />
What are you smoking and where can I get some?<br />
<br />
WoW sub numbers are the lowest they've been since December 2005, which this game was only a year old. <br />
<br />
Frankly, the honest truth is, Blizzard has been releasing sub par content for the past three expansions, and finally the players are tired of it. The players are tired of false &quot;promises&quot; (since they think a heavily advertised feature apparently isn't a promise) and the shit content expansion after expansion. <br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, I hope WoD ends with under 4 million people, which is looking more and more likely each quarter, and they finally get off their asses and return this game to something that remotely resembles the old version of this game, when it was actually a success.<br />
<br />
The biggest telling thing to me is that WoW lost this many subs, and they even went out of their way to not only release the patch right before the quarter ended to boost those numbers, but they also added in a &quot;free to play&quot; version of a sub, where gold was king. If free game time and a patch right before the quarter ended still saw the massive drop we saw, I can only imagine how bad it would have been if they had waited another week to drop the patch.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, WoW is officially dead. They have lost 44% of their player base in 6 short months. Talk about bad business decisions. I hope we see some people fired or &quot;stepping down&quot; over this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then again, I guess I can crawl into the fantasy world of Blizzard and their fanboys. Everything is okay after all, this game is clearly a success.</div></div><hr />

Depends on your region. In the U.S., it's the lowest at about 22k. If you're in EU, it's about 30k. If you're in any of the Asian countries, it's 300-900k.</div></div><hr />

This game legitimately needs daily quests and valor points to maintain player engagement. The WoD model really feels like the best one to me now, except for the completely unexciting -initial- 5 man loot. <br />
<br />
Players need:<br />
Reputations with at least a couple of power items.<br />
Reasons to run 5 man content beyond their loot tables.<br />
End game quest lines/zones.<br />
Patch content that expands upon all of that.<br />
<br />
There was only 1 major content patch in Wrath that didn't add a 5 man dungeon, the same patch that didn't launch with ANY of that, but 10 man ulduar was such a magical little dungeon that i guess people were satisfied regardless.<br />
<br />
We need quest hubs in every .x patch, with a dungeon, and a reputation. Period.</div></div><hr />

You are seriously overestimating the amount of people who quit over lack of flying or blizzard's statements.<br />

Farming minerals (which is meaningless thanks to butchering of professions), doing PVP zones (I had a blast in Halaa, Wintergrasp and Tol Barad - Ashran is absolute meh compared to that), having well-designed and meaningful dailies all qualify as open world content.

MoP wasn't really sub-par, in my opinion it was one of the best expansion released yet (if you ignore the &quot;Panda&quot; part, the end-game of 5.2 and 5.4 were incredible).<br />

<br />
WoD is the better expansion they've released since BC/WOTLK, it's just a little more sandbox-ey than what we're used to. It pains me everytime I see claims of &quot;unbalanced/boring PvP&quot; or &quot;no solo content&quot;, because that is simply not true at all.<br />
<br />
That being said, participation in certain areas of the game IS unusually low, which does ruin the experience for a lot of people. That is perhaps WoD's biggest flaw, Blizzard needs to be very careful about the learning curve of the next xpack, otherwise people will never be incentivized to dig a little deeper and maybe try to join (or create) a successful team/guild.</div></div><hr />

MoP was amazing, did everything right apart from the 14-month gap.

It is possible without 6.2 it would have been worse. Most of the time when companies say &quot;stabilized&quot;, it means that they hit a bottom and peaked up a bit. If you look quarter to quarter it may look unstable but they look month to month, which means at one point there were less people, then resubbed for 6.2.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, cant really blame people for not wanting to sit in their garrison staring at a wall when not in a raid. Its like cataclysm all over again where the raids are great but that's about it.

doesn't matter for blizzard, each token sub is technically 1.5 subs for them, it's better than normal subs since token subs are 1.5 times the price.<br />

so if 2.6m people pay with tokens thats as good as 6.9m subs from a business PoV.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they need to STOP listening to players. Listening to players is what ruined this fucking game. All the whiners, and complainers, and bitching casuals who turned Wotlk wow into the cesspool it has become. <br />
<br />
There's no incentive anymore for continued play. Blizzard knows this. You do the content, you quit, you come back. That's their plan and that will be their plan. <br />
<br />
What ruined wow, was listening to people.<br />
<br />
They tried, and failed, to fix this problem. And it's why I continually say LFR killed WoW. Because there is no longer an incentive to keep playing the game. People beat it, and quit... Because when you beat the game on patch day, there's nothing left to do. <br />
<br />
And the moment they attempt to drag content out a little. People bitch they can't finish Garrisons within a week. Or they bitch that it takes too long, or it's too grindy to do content. <br />
<br />
So they spoon fed the content to you, and people bitched. So they made the content open world and people bitched. the problem? Listening to people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But WoD is the biggest disappointment in the whole history of Warcraft end-game speaking.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately a great many people did not agree that MoP was a better Exp Pack. I had fun in MoP, but I did not believe it was the best expansion (based on actual facts, not opinions/anecdotal experience). Just take a look at the earnings calls for all the expansions. <br />
<br />
If you go by net gains/losses in subs, BC was the best expansion, ~8mil to ~11.5 mil subs (that is a pretty substantial gain, ~3.5mil and there was no loss in subs). No other expansion had this. WotLK had a net gain of ~500k. MoP had a ~2.6mil net loss. And WoD has had ~4.4mil net loss. Now, the previous are all a years worth of gain/loss. WoD outpaced them in half a year....so at least many can agree with you that WoD is by far the worst expansion to date.</div></div><hr />

On that note, they did put massive amounts of work into 7.0 before 6.0 even launched.

Resorting to insults on speaks volumes about your own character rather than the person you quoted.<br />
<br />
People will enjoy their games irregardless of public opinion or financial success. Subscription numbers only determine the status of a game, and the possible direction of future content (debatable).

Probably not many. Garrisons and lack of outdoor content most likely had much bigger impact on sub losses.<br />
<br />
Noone knows, not even Blizzard because their unsubscription form has very few option and nether Garrison nor no-flying are there. Also those players who used game time cards and tokens didn't &quot;unsubscribe&quot;, so they didn't get to fill out that form.</div></div><hr />

I just listened in to the stream on MMO-C frontpage, and to me it seems like they're quite happy with this Quarter. They are focusing on how to make money from Hearthstone and HotS more than worrying about WoW. They'll release another bullshit expansion and we'll all get it &quot;just to check it out&quot; and hang around for a few months until we realise why we got bored in the first place. And they'll sell that as a triumph again.<br />

No flying never bothered me, gave me somewhat of a vanilla feel again. I left because I was fucking bored. Not blaming the game, I'm just around for too long.. I don't get excited about it all anymore. And this time I won't ever come back.</div></div><hr />

Well if that quote is true, than I will keep an open mind for this new expansion. Considering how quickly they've already circled to announcing a new expansion less than a year since another has dropped does give some form of optimism to their developers.<br />
<br />
It seems as though all these new guys they've hired are up to speed. However, I feel WoW needs some dramatic changes that would take more than just one expansion to solve/address, even with such a large developing team.<br />

I'm sorry, not sure what you're implying. WoD turned out almost exactly the way it was announced in Blizzcon. Everything always looks nice and shiny during trailers and the like until you actually play it.<br />

Can I see your data on that, I have been looking for these numbers and you apparently have them.<br />
<br />
Simple, if Flying was even remotely the cause of even 10% of the loss in subs, 6.2 or 6.1 would of had flying. They're only adding it in now at the tail end of the x pack as a fun achievement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm...who said i cared? I wont get flying anyway cause its useless for me. Glad for those who wanted it. All i said is you cant say only 1 type of player quit because of this choice. Everyone plays for different reasons though imo and i bet blizzard wishes this to...they should have listened to people in beta and compromised then. <br />
Like i said im more annoyed at the whole two tier 1 year long xpac crap then whether people get flying or not.<br />
<br />
One big thing Blizzard can do to help their own product is actually listening to the beta testers...Lots of issues would have been prevented in both wod and mop.<br />
Few examples: Dailies in mop/gaiting, Ashran, flying, linking everything ever to your garrison, forcing people into a raid size. All things that were discussed to great lengths in beta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait wait wait. THIS ENTIRE EXPAC was timer after timer after timer. <br />
<br />
But dont forget to do your rep grinds because those are fun! <br />
<br />
Also lets not forget the biggest slap in the face during the release of 6.2 was the zero, I repeat ZERO modification of the patch during beta. They did not give a shit what the playerbase had to say. They didnt fix a single bug, modified a single issue players spoke about in beta. Ignoring your community they will walk. <br />
<br />
Class balance was shit, overnerfing every single class. PVP was complete trash.<br />

<br />
Flying per flying's sake isn't the cause for discontentment. It is that without flying a lot of areas in Draenor became difficult to travel to. For example, things like outdoor pet-battles, archaeology becomes simply annoying without flying. And for nearly half the expansion the flight paths were absolutely terrible. <br />

People literally spent the entire expansion in &quot;house-arrest&quot; in their own Garrisons. This burnt them out.</div></div><hr />

Name 2 more games you have played as much as WoW which is &gt; 10 years old? :P<br />
5 million people is alot tbh and even if WoW would die tomorrow, i would still tip my hat for Blizzard for making an awesome game.<br />
<br />
To sum up the community:<br />
&quot;WE WANT DAILIES!&quot; - Blizzard Gives Dailies - &quot;BOOO DAILIES ARE BORING!&quot;<br />
&quot;BLIZZARD FIX PVP!&quot; - Blizzard balance classes as much as possible - &quot;BOOO PVP SUCKS! I WANT TBC PVP WHERE 5 CLASSES COULD DO ARENA AND EVERY OTHER CLASS SUCKED!&quot;<br />
&quot;I WANT TO HAVE DYNAMIC RAID SIZES!&quot; - Blizzard gives dynamic raid sizes within reasonable numbers - &quot;BOOO I CAN'T RAID WITH 5 PPL!&quot;<br />
<br />
No matter what they change people will still hate on it, not cause the game sucks, but cause they are bored of the game.<br />
Have you actually thought about it as, maybe you are not as dedicated to gaming anymore? Maybe you have gotten other hobbies?<br />
Just cause YOU hate the game, doesnt say everyone hates it, some people play it for fun, some just do raids, some just do dailies etc etc, sooner or later, you'll get bored.<br />
And if you look at it from a game perspective, you can only make a game repetitive That many times to make it fun. Heck even Minecraft was fun with a huge new world, all worlds looking different etc.<br />
That was true until you got bored of doing the same thing over and over again...<br />

Anecdotal evidence is anecdotal, but that's what happened with me. I don't need to pay for Diablo 3, and its endgame is more engaging than what was offered in Warlords of Draenor, despite being a dungeon crawler.<br />

You don't shelve nigh half of your launch playerbase with a good product, you just don't. This expansion has been a calamity and, irrespective of why you think that is, it just can't be painted as anything else.<br />

I doubt they'd keep WoW around if it stopped being profitable. Never felt this bummed out after an earning's call since if WOW is done for, that's the end of mmorpg's for me. Period.

<br />
I highly doubt anything in the development cycle will actually change in a significant manner.<br />
<br />
I think you're right, but a lot of the problem comes from Dev arrogance. WoWs been the biggest dog on the block for 10 years now and the way they talk to the community is quite condescending. They keep playing Mad Scientist with core WoW and/or MMO formulas and you get what WoD is today;World of Instancecraft: Raid or Die - Menu Edition. If they rolled the game design back to the any point during WotLK, the game would shoot back up to 10 million subs. They think they've got it all figured out and treat the player base like a bunch of unenlightened heathens.</div></div><hr />

Anyone who has been involved in Beta - Present knows they stopped listening to the player base. Removal of class iconic abilities, broken promises in 6.1, and the constant onslaught of hot fix after hot fix AFTER the PTR which at times made enormous changes in a specs viability. Blizzard has created a volatile gaming experience where from week to week you don't know if your class is going to go from top to bottom of the chart or vise versa.<br />
<br />
How about trinkets that can do up to 25% of your dps??? How is that skill?<br />
<br />
OR What about half of WoD being a Redskined BC killing bosses we already killed. Blizzard forgot the what made them great, Telling good stories. <br />

<br />
The figures don't add up either, they've got more people working on wow than ever before yet this expansion was probably the weakest to date, with only 2 raids tiers and somewhat abysmal PvP content. They took skills away, they took cooldowns away and any classes that were even remotely difficult to play (Demo warlock) were nerfed into the ground. This expansion pack cost the most out of all of them so far and the most exciting adventures are done by your followers in your garrison. I have no real criticisms about the raiding side as usual it's been great content, but substantially less of it for a higher price, hopefully it's not a year of no content like with SoO...<br />
<br />
You also need to take into account the wow token, those numbers would be down a lot more if it wasn't so easy to just do garrison missions and get a free subscription.<br />
<br />
Might just be me reading too much into this but it doesn't state that these people work solely on WoW but we don't know the ratios of people on Hearthstone, diablo, overwatch etc. and I think it's plain to see that hearthstone has probably been a much greater investment for Blizzard over the last year than WoW. <br />
<br />
Lets just wait till the 6th and see if the new expansion shows us anything that might pique our interest, maybe hearthstone integration! Wait I'll call it now, Free hearthstone card back with the collectors edition of WoW: The Return of the lich king in the emerald dream.</div></div><hr />

And I would bet Wotlk was done before Activision merged with Blizz. I mean... there's a reason Ulduar was godly, and ICC had welfare epics.<br />

<br />
In fact.... that's all it was<br />
<br />
Well, it had a way to obtain raid-quality loot through dungeons and stuff like argent tournament and wintergrasp. Also, it had the best story of probably all expansions, that helped too :p .</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since they grouped those games together, its very likely that one them are doing very poorly or that two of them are doing so-so. My guess would be HotS and Destiny are the lowest, while Hearthstone has the bulk of that number.</div></div><hr />

You mean a focus on dungeon content as a stepping stone into the easy 10 man normal raiding scene was superior to force feeding shit LFR content so players think they beat the game?<br />

I wish they'd just make the game THEY themselves want to play. Music and films that wants to cater to as many people as possible at the cost of the artistry/integrity of its maker(s) are usually bad. It's the same with games.<br />
<br />
No, you're wrong. The game is just old and games have an expiry date. With expansion and content updates you can extend this expiry date considerably but it will die at some point.</div></div><hr />

Well, amazingly enough, focusing on dungeon content improves subs. I'm still not sure the initial raid tier was handled in an optimal way (my guild was bored to death between T11 and ulduar, which had many negative consequences). Also, frankly, there was less mechanics to deal with on an average Naxx 10 boss than on some LFR bosses today.</div></div><hr />

Oh no, the first tier was far too easy. That's a common complaint, something they fixed in Ulduar with the introduction of hardmodes. <br />
<br />
I will forever say that the first nail in the coffin was merging 10/25 man raiding into one difficulty, and LFR lowered it into the ground. Since then it's been struggling on a limited supply of air</div></div><hr />

But the thing is, Activision is just a sugar daddy. It just gives money. Sure they may influence in some small ways (DLC, cash shops), but what is created out of that influence is entirely up to the developer.<br />
<br />
Activision isn't sending in their own in-house developers with Activision aligned development ideas. Blizzard has proven that it works best doing what it loves.

Really? I thought it had one of the worst stories Blizzard have ever put out. Typical Blizzard swings, if something is too cold they heat it up until it's comparable to magma.<br />
<br />
Their response to Illidan's lack of presence in TBC was to make Arthas SO present in absolutely everything that he was just retarded and non-threatening, THERE MUST ALWAYS BE A LICH KING, Icecrown turning into a Mordor ripoff, Anub'arak being given attrocious lore treatment and KT not getting much better - literally every scourge hero from W3 was either ruined or spat on.<br />
<br />
Interesting material, but handled horribly. Polar opposite of MOP, which had some pretty decent stories, but not many people gave a crap about pandaren, myself included.</div></div><hr />

Essentially rebrand, repackage and integrate with their new technologies. I'm not saying this from the perspective that &quot;WotLK was perfect and did no wrong.&quot; It had its faults, but compared to other expansions, it had content diversity, content longevity and content depth. Something that WoD sorely lacks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before the holy mega infallible and perfect WotLK came out. People have been claiming WoW is going to die since.... day 1? Why people blame Blizzard's decisions based on Activision is beyond me. Sure Activision sees the sub loss as a non-issue because they're still making record profits, but besides that, all they are is a publisher. They fund the development of games, they fund marketing, sure they may ask for some form of cash shop, but unlike many developers, Blizzard gets a lot of leeway.<br />
<br />
Whatever WoW is now, it's of Blizzard's own fault. Maybe because they're overly ambitious, or they lost their passion, or have become complacent due to their success, who knows. But anyone advocating it's Acitivision's fault needs to rethink their process. Activision doesn't develop games. The outcome of a game is purely based on the developer.<br />
<br />
Activision don't make the game but they do pull every string on the people who do make the game. I don't understand how someone could say they don't have an influence on the running of the game, they have the ultimate influence and can pull the plug on WoW at any time if it isn't pleasing their pockets. The notion of Blizzard having special privileges or whatever is laughable and the line of Blizzard remaining independent was a marketing deception from day 1. <br />
With Bungie and Destiny there is a direct comparison of a formerly independent studio who made Halo and what they have now become under Activision in terms of low quality frequent expansions, micro transactions and various other corporate anti-consumer schemes. You have your head in the sand if you think WoW doesn't now have many of the Activision trademark practices all over it at this stage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And &quot;welfare&quot; epics have existed, since before WotLK. Arena gear in BC. It just sounds like you're projecting your own little dislikes to blame for the current state of WoW.<br />
<br />
Arena gear in TBC wasn't intended to be a welfare into wow raiding. and gear didn't matter in TBC once you were in epics, so I don't see your point.<br />
<br />
And I'm not saying activision sent developers in to secretly sabotage wow. You think Developers get the first and godly say in what happens to wow? Laughable. No someone in a suit decides that before the developers get started. Learn corporate structure. I'm sure Activision/Blizzard is loaded with executives who run things.<br />
<br />
And yes, any stockholder who wants to invest heavily into a gaming company, is sure as shit going to know about the most profitable game in the market. Do you... Do you think that they just throw money at companies who have pretty logos? No, they pay someone to pour over reports and annual reviews to see if the company is a good investment. If they own enough of the company, they then place someone up top to make decisions. And if I'm a stockholder, I'm buying before an x pack release, and selling 3 months after.<br />
<br />
don't think it's just gaming, (EA's majority of profits come from DLC) The entire economy is now a rat race to please the CEO of the month in their perspective conglomerate.</div></div><hr />
