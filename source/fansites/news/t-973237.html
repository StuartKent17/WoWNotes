Does this mean it can no longer proc off for example a Mage's Deep Freeze or Combustion (since they have a 30s/2minute cooldown respectively)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It means the bonus spell will benefit from any cooldowns you are using. So if you have elemental mastery up as a shaman it will still get your 15% damage bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it means that internal CDs of trinkets such as Theralion's Mirror won't be ignored anymore, I read you could get a 50% uptime of the buff with the legendary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bug fix to this has been live for almost a week already and was used to address trinkets. The Wrath duplication was ignoring the ICD of rng proc trinkets allowing for large uptimes on trinkets like Theralion's Mirror (http://www.wowhead.com/item=65105)</div></div><hr />

It's humorous, that's all. The people who are doing the attempt are well aware of the HP reduction by now :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Traeumerin</div><div class="date">2011-09-08, 11:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with the legendary-stuff is, that they tried to correct the &quot;droprate&quot; of the legendary the wrong way.<br />
<br />
Stage 1 - Eternal Embers<br />
Regarding to the google-spreadsheet, we get 0,8 Embers in 10m and 2 in 25m on average.<br />
This sums up to 31 needed bosskills on 10m and 12 on 25m.<br />
<br />
Stage 2 - Cinders<br />
If we look again at the spreadsheet, we get 24,5 in 10m heroic and 60,5 in 25m heroic<br />
leaving us with 41 bosskills in 10m and 17 in 25m.<br />
<br />
Stage 3 - Essences<br />
Previous to all the changes, we got ~8 in 10m heroic and ~18 in 25m heroic.<br />
So 32 bosskills in 10m and 14 bosskills in 25m were needed.<br />
<br />
As you can see, the bottleneck was stage 2, which took the most time in both raids.<br />
<br />
Time needed for the first legendary:<br />
10m: 104 bosskills<br />
25m: 43 bosskills<br />
-&gt; 2,41:1<br />
<br />
Time needed for all further legendarys:<br />
10m: 41 bosskills<br />
25m: 17 bosskills<br />
-&gt; 2,41:1<br />
<br />
BUT NOW - with the change(!) - the number of essences for 25m heroic got nerfed to 9,5.<br />
For the 250 essences you now need 27 bosskills and so the new bottleneck for 25m is stage 3 whith 27 bosskills.<br />
<br />
Because of that, the time needed for a further legendary is now:<br />
10m: 41 bosskills<br />
25m: 27 bosskills<br />
-&gt; 1,52:1<br />
<br />
I would not be surprised if 25m-Raids would now be &quot;forced&quot; to run 10m to optimize stage 3.<br />
The only correct way to slow down the &quot;droprate&quot; of the legendary whould have been to reduce the droprate of the cinders to tighten the previous bottleneck.</div></div><hr />

they're talking about the Beth nerfs, not the Reggy ones :p the Raggy one clearly states Hc mode.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking as the Beth nerf DOESN'T state Hc or Normal, it means both? not really sure WHY normal needed a nerf though, it's already a pretty easy fight :p</div></div><hr />
