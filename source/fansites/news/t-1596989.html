<br />
I find it extremely weird Blizzard points to 8 year old GPUs as the minimum spec to play WOW.<br />
<br />
Rough translation to more modern hardware.<br />
<br />
Required:<br />
Nvidia GPU: 740GT, shoud be even more powerful than the 8800GT. Also look out for Nvidias 900 lineup to produce some budget cards.<br />
Intel CPU: Any i3 dual core from current generation should be outperforming the old Core 2 duos.<br />
AMD GPU: AMD R7 240 should outperform the HD 4850 easily.<br />
AMD CPU: Any AM3+ quad core should outperform Blizzards minimum recommended.<br />
<br />
Recommended:<br />
Nvidia GPU: GTX750 or GTX750 Ti should be adequate. Look out for Nvidias GTX950 / GTX950 Ti once they are released.<br />
Intel CPU: Any I5/7 quad core from current generation should perform beyond the one Blizzard recommends.<br />
AMD GPU: Somewhere between 260x and 270x i believe.<br />
AMD CPU: Blizzard actually listed a modern CPU.<br />
<br />
An additional comment on storage requirement. People who took some advice 1-3 years ago may have heard some muttering about fitting Windows + WOW on a 60GB SSD. Sadly this is no longer the case with Blizzards 10GB addition to the game. On the positive side, 120GB today is cheaper than 60GB was 3 years ago. 120GB can be bought for the low price of 60-80 USD, while a 240GB goes for 100-120USD. Plenty of room for low pay, to the point where i run a 500GB ssd and nothing else.<br />
<br />
Blizzards recent approach to using more of the graphics card in the game is a welcome one. Earlier you would spend all your money on a powerful CPU and throw what was left on a graphics card. This approach meant you could play MMOs, RTS and other CPU intensive games well. But not much else, first person and third person games were pretty much thrown out the window as they focus much more on graphical fidelity than MMOs. Hopefully you can now get away with around 50% CPU, 50% GPU and still play WOW and every other game without selling your kidney.<br />
<br />
These changes will go unnoticed for the though. My chair and table cost more than PS4/XBONE and my screen cost more than most spend on their computer.</div></div><hr />

If you can play WoW now at any framerate above 10, you can play WoW in WoD, more than likely at a higher frame rate than you could now.</div></div><hr />

i'm at constant 60fps (have it set to 60being the max frame rate. with a mixture of medium+high graphics settings. the only thing i have on fair is the particle density - mostly because it hurts my eyes if it's too intense)<br />

You can't be serious :D<br />
Constant 60 FPS, where? In a hole in the ground while looking at the floor? ;)<br />
A 530 is not even an entry level gaming gpu (its basically for office).<br />
<br />
Anyways, i had to play WoD with my old GTX 260 for a while because my 670 got repaired.<br />
I could hardly sustain 30 FPS in some areas while questing, on medium or lower.<br />
This is on an I5-3570K@4,2Ghz.<br />
<br />
Could you post the rest of your system specs plz?<br />
If your CPU is good enough (Intel) and your PSU too, then u could just upgrade to a real gaming GPU, like a 270x or better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw, the Blizzard system requirements have always been bullshit, like with most games.<br />
FX 4100? WTF, that means they recommend raiding at 10 FPS in 25man (e.g. Malkorok HC) :P<br />
WoW/WoD is still only using max 1,5 cpu threads...</div></div><hr />

<br />
A fresh installation is quite useless since it would essentially download the same files and put them into the new file system at the point of patch installation. I've been going with the same installation for 6 years now, no problems at all. If you want to reset your installation then delete the cache folders (plural serves a purpose here), WTF folder for game, character, and addon settings, and the content of your Interface/Addon folder for addons. And that's it. Everything else would be the same no matter what you did.</div></div><hr />
