Battle.net Balance is now live! As we announced previously, Battle.net Balance is a new feature that gives players an alternate way to purchase Blizzard digital products and services directly through their Battle.net accounts. Players are now able add to their Battle.net Balance using a variety of payment methods, and then use that balance toward Blizzard Entertainment products and services such as World of Warcraft game time; paid services, such as realm transfers and character name changes; digital versions of select Blizzard games, including Diablo II and StarCraft II; and in-game pets and mounts. In the near future, players will be also able to use Battle.net Balance for the digital World of Warcraft Battle Chest and WoW digital upgrades. In addition, with the upcoming launch of Diablo III, players will have the option to use Battle.net Balance to buy and sell items in the game’s currency-based auction house.<br />
<br />
For more information, check out the Battle.net Balance FAQ, or head to the Battle.net Balance page in Account Management to manage your balance.<br />

Mages and Arenas<br />
Just off the top of my head, this is how diminishing returns works for mages:<br />
<br />
Deep Freeze is on the stun diminishing returns. Ring of Frost and Polymorph are on the disorient DR. The mage Frost Nova and the Water Elemental's Freeze are both on the root DR. Improved Cone of Cold and Shattered Barrier are on the random root DR. There are also several snares which are not affected by DR, such as Frostbolt<br />
<br />
The random root DR mentioned is actually a separate category to normal roots. We reserve this only for effects that are procs, instead of those that are the general effect of a spell. This is a very subtle and subjective classification that often comes down to simply what feels right. <br />
<br />
Currently, we think that Frost mages have too much control in PvP. This is just something that has grown over time because we always felt that these &quot;chilling&quot; and &quot;freezing&quot; effects should naturally slow you down. Part of the design that we are implementing with the Mists of Pandaria talent changes are to move some of that control Frost mages have to the talent tree. This means it will be possible for a Frost mage to choose these options, but they come at the expense of others, Arcane and Fire mages also have the opportunity to get those control choices as well! :O<br />
<br />
The overall effect of this is that Arcane and Fire should stay about neutral in regards to their control, but frost will lose some of it. On the other hand though, it is possible for a Frost's damage to go up and be competitive with that of the other mages if they do not go for the control talents. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216895-freeze-in-arenas/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3313132817?page=1#8)) <br />
<br />
Inscription and Glyph Discovery<br />
Back in May of 2010, we began tossing around ideas about how to improve Inscription. But at that time, Mists of Pandaria was still in the early stages of character talent development. As that was hashed out, it directly affected how we were then able to approach potential Inscription and glyph changes. As a matter of fact, at one point during the discussions, glyphs were going to be removed altogether. That then evolved into the idea of Prime glyphs being removed, Major glyphs being adjusted such that their added bonuses did not affect talents, and Minor glyphs being revamped so they felt more interesting.<br />
<br />
Have no fear, I have been assured that Inscription and glyph discovery are being actively discussed in preparation for upcoming changes with Mists of Pandaria. This comes with one albeit relieving caveat: Glyphs that are now learned solely through the Book of Glyph Mastery are planned to be available through the Northrend and Minor research dailies. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216659-glyph-inscription-leveling/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3988399966?page=3#41))<br />
<br />
Account-wide Achievements<br />
With Mists of Pandaria, account-wide achievements will indeed become available at the Battle.net account level, and many achievements will be shared among characters. A wide array of achievements will certainly be covered, including achievements that relate to everything from raiding and PvP to maxing out professions and assorted fun challenges. We really love the idea that players will at last be able to proudly display proof of the full scope of their adventures around Azeroth, regardless of which character they choose to play on any given day.<br />
<br />
While we are still working out the details regarding how various specific achievements will interact with the new system, once we have a bit more information to share with you, we’ll certainly let you know. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/216957-shared-achievements/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4015164096#5))<br />
<br />
Why Mists of Pandaria?<br />
First, for some context, we showed a lot of pandaren at BlizzCon because that was the art we had completed at the time (and obviously it's the new playable race). Are there pandaren all over the new continent? Of course. There are also some really unique cultures and new races, including some very diabolical villains in the form of the mogu, the mantid, and the sha.<br />
<br />
As a few posters have pointed out, Pandaria starts out relatively unspoiled. (spoiler!) That isn’t going to last. The Horde versus Alliance conflict is going to continue to ratchet up in a way we've often talked about, but never really delivered before now. It gives the story more depth (we hope!) when you get to see the “before” before the “after.”<br />
<br />
The new continent has a heavy Asian vibe, but it’s still a fantasy game and there are some very fantastic and original landscapes as well. The last few zones in particular are what we like to call &quot;high concept.&quot; You won’t find anything like them in the real world.<br />
<br />
With all that said, you might still be asking, &quot;why MoP?&quot;<br />
<br />
We think, more than seven years into World of Warcraft's life cycle, it's time to start some new stories. Previous expansions relied heavily on heroes and villains established in the Warcraft RTS games. We aren’t content to rest on our laurels though. We want to introduce some new characters to get to know. We want to have some new enemies to fight. Perhaps, most importantly, we want to start sowing the seeds for future stories. Nothing is lamer than finding out that the boss you're supposed to kill is someone you've never heard of. It’s a lot more fun when you get to know the bad guys, get a reason to hate them, and feel like you're thwarting their diabolical plans and not just killing them for loot.<br />
<br />
We've focused a lot on the lighter side of Mists of Pandaria as a contrast to the world-ending vibe of Cataclysm. It’s not all unicorns and butterflies however. There are dark secrets lurking beneath the new continent, and in some ways they're even more insidious, because you get to experience the beautiful new landscapes before they become threatened and sometimes even destroyed.<br />
<br />
To summarize, we provided you all with a very basic framework for the next expansion at BlizzCon. By the time the press tour ends in March, expect to get a lot more information on the real meat of this expansion. It won't be correctly summarized by a portrait of a smiling panda chewing on bamboo. <br />
<br />
Phasing is one of the most powerful tools in the designer toolkit. But like many powerful tools, it can cause great damage if used incorrectly. We definitely have overdone it in the past.<br />
<br />
There is some phasing in Mists, but we try to take care not to separate friends, create ghosted mining nodes, and similarly disrupt your gameplay. What we were really referring to by the “dark secrets” is the way the story unfolds. The story in Cataclysm was something players knew from the outset -- Deathwing is back. The players were still heroes trying to undo some of the damage he caused, but they also still largely reacted to the things Deathwing and his minions had already done. In Mists we're attempting to take that one step further and have the world react to the players, and not just have the players react to the world. It gives the game a dynamic, “alive” feeling which is very much needed in a persistent-world game.<br />
<br />
Some of the changes we’re talking about aren't going to happen right away, but we’ll build toward them in subsequent patches. While you can’t truly keep story secrets in this business, we're trying not to spoil the surprises too early. In retrospect, we’ve taken a little bit of flak for this approach, because the misconception among some players is that the new continent has no conflict. There is plenty of conflict, but a lot of it begins when you arrive (rather than in Cataclysm, where great cracks in Azeroth appeared before your adventuring began).

The Battlenet thing: You load it with money, so you can buy things in D3 with it. Everytime you post an auction, Blizzard gets a cut from the posting fee, so, decreasing the amount of money you have. If you sell, Blizzard stills get the fee, you get the money, but you can't withdraw it?<br />

In vanilla, every mage I knew was either all frost or arcane/frost and only shot frost bolt all day. Maybe this was based off the fact that half the mobs in MC including Rag were immune to fire damage.</div></div><hr />

Theres no way in hell everyone on these small servers can afford to xfer all there alts to larger pop servers. Larger pop servers also dont want all these misguided toons on them either. Wheres the talk of a solution?<br />
<br />
I have seen several blue posts and even spoke to GM's about my current servers population and faction imbalance.<br />
<br />
The reason for no solutions is simple, they don't want to start fixing the problem by merging servers etc. as it admits to the outside world the sky is falling. Would be hundreds of game sites with headlines like 'wow is dead, server merger inc' but as long as Blizzard keeps everyone moderately happy they don't care.</div></div><hr />

It's so Blizzard can hold onto it .. maybe put it in their savings account and make interest off it?<br />

probably wont see the xpac until August / September beta in may would be my guess, that's if the beta takes the standard amount of time. Blizzard has said there farther in then they have been with any dev cycle so it may be sooner.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lol, they're just now saying something about frost mages having to much control.<br />
<br />
Nope they said that like the first season cata and also said it was more balanced at higher ratings but less so at low ratings/BG's and is a hard thing to fix.<br />
MoP will fix a lot of those issues as the blue poster states cause you just wont be able to have as many CC talents as you do now and other classes can take more then they would currently be able to.</div></div><hr />

As many CC talents? You're right about that, their wont be. But that doesn't mean you wont still be able to acquire some of those abilities. I take every blue post with a grain of salt, and expect most of what they're saying to be BS. Didn't they also say it would raise the requirements for wow should they update all the player models, just before they released what the panda models look like. (i could be wrong on that if so I apologize). They say its to difficult to implement cross server trading for heirlooms... When they have the blizz store set up so that if you buy something from the store its sent to all toons. They could easily tap into that system by making heirloom items raise a flag on your account when purchased in game, and then when you start a toon that can wear x gear its mailed to them. bam. instant heirloom cross server trading. They say they dont have the resources as an excuse for just about everything and for the mass majority of cata all we got was reskins and rehashed content. Take blue posts with a grain of salt. :P it's less of a let down. :P</div></div><hr />

Microtransactions are expensive for retailers for small amounts to the point where they lose money. In order to create cost savings, you add amounts which are higher than the few microtransactions you were going to purchase and blizzard loses less per transaction in merchant fees.<br />

I dropped my sub as soon as I realized how boring face smashing into DS week after week on heroic with my main, and LFR on my 8 alts would be. Then they felt the need to accelerate the farming process for DS with a raid-wide buff, so not only can you queue for it via raid finder, but you can also easily blaze through it on normal via pugging through trade. Twice a week, 9 characters... you do the math. It's not &quot;raiding&quot; anymore in any traditional sense, and they seem to think it will hold everyone's interest until MoP.

<br />
Except for the part where there are arenas in Diablo 3 and you will essentially be able to buy the best gear, putting everyone else at an immediate disadvantage.<br />
<br />
So you're basically saying,<br />
&quot;Just because you WANT to be competitive doesn't mean you NEED to be competitive. You have the OPTION to pay extra money every time new gear is released. You can just spend weeks at a massive disadvantage while you spend hours farming while others have already bought better items with real money. See, totally optional and fair!&quot;<br />
<br />
Granted, I haven't kept up-to-date on whether there will be different sets of PVP/PVE gear, etc. But last I checked, there weren't. So this is essentially like allowing players to buy the *best* arena and raid sets with real money, and then telling everyone being facerolled while they spend months raising their rating/downing bosses for the same loot that the field is totally fair. Yeah, LMFAO is right. LMFAO @ Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

So your only two choices were to either run all 9 characters through LFR every week plus your main through heroic DS or quit? Sounds like you'd burn yourself out on any content like that no matter how awesome it is. I'd suggest trying a bit of moderation.</div></div><hr />
