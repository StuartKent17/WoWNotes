PTR Notes update - Karazhan attunement removed 
Test realm patch notes on both EU and US official sites have been updated, I guess the most surprising addition is the Karazhan attunement being &quot;removed&quot;. Nothing about the new alchemist stones or new epic gems yet, but hopefully you can just check yesterday's news for that." />

PTR Notes update - Karazhan attunement removed<br />
Test realm patch notes on both EU and US official sites have been updated, I guess the most surprising addition is the Karazhan attunement being &quot;removed&quot;. Nothing about the new alchemist stones or new epic gems yet, but hopefully you can just check yesterday's news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=4745.0) for that.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid<br />
Lifebloom: the healing coefficient has been reduced. This spell will no longer cause error messages when interacting with Spellsteal or while the Druid is under the effects of a Mind Control.<br />
Nurturing Instinct increases your healing spells by up to 50/100% of your Agility, and increases healing done to you by 10/20% while in Cat form. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br />
Improved Blink: This talent no longer reduces the mana cost of Blink. Instead, it increases the chance for all attacks to miss the Mage by 25% for 2/4 sec after Blink is cast. <br />
Icy Veins no longer stacks with Bloodlust, Heroism, or Power Infusion. <br />
Mana Shield: This spell will now get a percentage of the Mage’s bonus to spell damage as an additional effect. (Note : That's 50% of your spell damage)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest<br />
Power Infusion: Infuses the target with power, increasing their spell haste by 20% and reducing the mana cost of all spells by 20%. Lasts for 15 seconds.This will not stack with other haste effects, such as Heroism, Bloodlust, or Icy Veins. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />

Rockbiter Weapon: Tooltip and error messages have been adjusted slightly. <br />
Shamanistic Rage is now a Physical ability instead of a Magic spell, and thus is no longer dispellable. It now reduces all damage taken by 30% and gives your successful melee attacks a chance to regenerate mana equal to 30% of your attack power. This lasts for 15 seconds with a 2 minute cooldown. <br />
Toughness will now also reduce the duration of movement impairing effects on you by 10/20/30/40/50%. <br />

Emberstorm now also reduces the cast time of your incinerate spell by 2/4/6/8/10%. <br />
Life Tap: This spell now has only 3 ranks. Each now costs a fixed percentage of maximum health to cast, and grants the same fixed percentage of maximum mana: Rank 1 is 5%, Rank 2 is 12%, and Rank 3 is 20%. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Arenas<br />
Matchmaking: If a queued player has a personal rating higher than their team rating, the matchmaking system will now use the highest personal rating of a queued member of that team for matchmaking purposes, instead of the team rating. In addition, when making a calculation for rating gains and losses at the end of a match, the calculation will use the higher of the personal or team ratings on the opposing team. <br />
The benefits of drinking out of combat have been delayed while in the Arena. It will now take four seconds before the full benefit of the mana regeneration will come into effect. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
World Environment<br />
Elites in Blade’s Edge Plateau Regions: These creatures now have an increased chance to drop rare depleted items. <br />
<br />

Blizzcast Episode #2 Live!<br />
Nothing really new here but it talks a bit about the changes to Magtheridon in 2.4, sounds like it's worth linking. <br />
The second episode of the official Blizzard Podcast, BlizzCast, is now available! It begins with none other than our Vice President of Creative Development Chris Metzen who shares his thoughts and experiences on building the stories for our franchises. From the origin of Starcraft to the conceptual stage of continuing stories in Wrath of the Lich King and Starcraft II, we get to share with you his point of view on making some of the most epic stories weve ever had a chance to play.<br />
<br />
We also got a chance to sit down with one of our raid designers, Geoff Goodman, to discuss the evolution of the raid dungeon encounter Magtheridon and the changes it will see in patch 2.4. Then thanks to the response from our players and fans we finish with a Q&amp;A session that has information on Starcraft lore and World of Warcraft design changes.<br />
<br />
Both episodes 1 and 2 are available right now here at the BlizzCast webpage: http://us.blizzard.com/blizzcast/ (http://us.blizzard.com/blizzcast/)<br />

Mages - Mana shield changes<br />
That's not an official post, but there is a nice article on Radikalnoise.com (http://www.radikalnoise.com/2008/02/big-ol-mana-shields.html) about the changes to mana shield. <br />
<br />
&quot;One incoming change in 2.4 that has received little coverage here or anywhere else has been the improvements to Mana Shield. For those way out of the loop, Mana Shield now receives half of your +damage, and in PvP gear, we're talking about 500 more absorbed per shield -- this extra absorption comes at no extra mana cost, and with Improved Mana Shield, it will operate overall at near 1:1 efficiency.&quot;<br />
<br />

Felmyst disabled on PTRs<br />
To allow players on the PTR to test the encounters after Felymyst, we've decided to disable Felmyst on the PTR. When Felmyst is engaged, she will now kill herself and allow raids to continue on to the encounters afterwards.<br />
<br />
As a reminder, Kalecgos and Brutallus are also still disabled at this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since my main is a warrior I wouldn't exactly like this change to go through as it will make me a lot less viable, however i think it's exactly the kind of thing that had to be done to spice up arenas which were becoming stale - there will be new setups galore.<br />

This doesn't affect the Totem, only the weapon buff. The totem is unchanged. It's a self buff for the Shaman only.<br />
<br />
Regarding Kara attunement, most people who would have already been through Kara I'd guess. All this does is means that you won't have to repeat the same quests if you want to bring an alt in.</div></div><hr />

&lt;/Sarcasm&gt;<br />
<br />
No reason to keep a Kara attunement after they lowered heroics to honored (on my alt, i didnt do anything special, only my quests (including dongeon quests) and im keyed for every heroics... no grind, no nothing).<br />
<br />
If they are to let everyone in ''hard'' content that gets pugged everyday, i dont see why Karazhan, which is mostly ran by guilds (who can ask their member to gear up before) should need a key.</div></div><hr />

Self buff?<br />
<br />
Summons a Flametongue Totem with 5 health at the feet of the caster. The totem enchants all party members' main-hand weapons with fire if they are within 20 yards. Each hit causes XX additional Fire damage (see Description by rank level), based on the speed of the weapon. Slower weapons cause more Fire damage per swing. Lasts 2 mins.<br />

The totem buff is absolutely ridiculous and there's no way in hell that makes live without some kind of catch.<br />

<br />
Kalgan DID say he wants enhance to be more competative in 2v2 and 3v3. The change to flametongue totem allowes restoration (all brackets) and elemental (3v3, 5v5 probably) to provide the debuff for others, making them more viable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Except Next Patch they're making it where toughness (Armor Talent) Decreases the duration of movement imparing effects by 50%... or so I had read at one point.<br />
<br />
So really, that should help a 'tiny' little bit. The only major concern at that point is hamstring me thinks. Don't quote me though, my enhance shammy is still only 65. But as a priest for 3 years, I know the pain :P</div></div><hr />

It is still going to have it's share of flaws, it will still be kited, it still has weak defenses, it still has no CC's or controls. It will be better, and pretty damn viable in the right hands, but it's not going to be some bracket breaking monster spec.<br />
<br />
The interesting part is from the totem, and the possibility of opening up all kinds of new arena setups. It's actually a pretty smart change if you really think about it. <br />
<br />
Fire is a pretty free totem, so it will not be an issue to keep it down. Healing, and I say this as a healer, is just too strong in most situations in arena. This combats the absolute need to have a Warrior in most setups, allows different classes to be brought in, and maintains the group support mentality of the Shaman.<br />
<br />
I like it, now I just need to finish my Shaman alt.</div></div><hr />

This combats the absolute need to have a Warrior in most setups, allows different classes to be brought in, and maintains the group support mentality of the Shaman.<br />
I like it too, even though it does mean that you'll lose WF totem buffing on your group. I guess you'd probably use WF against all-DPS teams and Flametongue against teams with healers (in the smaller brackets).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Healshaman can be easy purged and with the low base hp they go down easy<br />
Meleeshaman does a hell lot of damage but is very easy to kite<br />
Ele Sham is easy to interupt theyre casts<br />
<br />
shaman doesnt deserve a nerf in any kind of ways<br />
and this flametongue shit isnt going to help them if a melee shaman is in an 5v5 team they will be focussed first because of the flametongue debuff and as i mentioned before they will go down quick because of the low base hp.<br />
<br />
Shamans need a CC or another anti CC than grounding totem</div></div><hr />

It's not removed. It's only optional now. But tbh, who's not going to do it? It only takes a few normal instance runs. And almost everyone will do at least that before going to Kara. This just delays the need to do those specific instances.</div></div><hr />

It's prep for the expansion. When you are level to 80 on some alt and want to try a kara for fun on the way, you don't wouldn't bother if you were getting attuned.<br />

It would be like having to get attuned for sunken temple or something.</div></div><hr />

Now that wording for the Kara attunement lift seems a bit odd, But im assuming Kara is officially the New UBRS, only one person needing the key to open it. Thus its really not lifting anything...just now acting as any retired dungeon imo.</div></div><hr />

from blizzard's standpoint, the less time played while keeping a subscription going makes more money<br />
less bandwidth usage and cpu time used is less cost at the end of the month<br />
<br />
that's right, not only do casuals outnumber 'hardcore raiders', they pay more for less service<br />
think of these changes as being them rewarding their most valued customers.</div></div><hr />

Is this a joke? If you arent joking your a flipping idiot. Getting Attuned to Karazhan takes one night, and aside from Slabs and BM, a rouge who knows what he is doing can solo a good chunk of it. <br />
<br />
I got news for you pal. Scrubs in blues and greens find ABSOLUTELY no difficulty getting keyed to Karazhan. I dont know how many epics you needed to beat those four non heroic dungeons, but i did them pretty well in blues and greens. And the first time i went in to karazhan, I died on Attumen. Now Attumen is as big of a joke to me as Duke Nukem Forever, but point is, I was a major scrub back when i got attuned. Scrubs have been getting into kara since BC came out.<br />
<br />
<br />
And i spend 1-2 hours a night on this game. Blow me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all: It'sa totem, okey, it's VERY easy to get it down. As soon as you've start your regular lockdown of whatever shammy(spec) and killed the totem the initial shit is over, and suddenly the healing debuff is gone.<br />
Since it's a wep buff, you wont see melee cranking with WF. Burst potential drops, even though healing will be harder. Hefty spike dmg was also something we had for our team, but here we will be given a choice.<br />
<br />
It's VERY powerful, and I doubt it goes live, but I'm quite sure there are alot of ways of countering this. Specially in 5's.</div></div><hr />

I don't care about granting access to Karazhan to more people, I don't think that everyone who doesn't want to play the game 40+ hours per week is a &quot;scrub&quot;. <br />
<br />
I don't like removing Karazhan attunement for another reason: this particular attunement made (for once) perfect sense. You came to locked tower of the greates mage of all times, you did couple of quests, talked to his pupil to find out where his master is, did favour for Medivh himself and was rewarded by a key to his tower. <br />
<br />
Other attunements don't make any sense usually - like why would you need to kill 2 bosses in SSC, 1 in TK and 1 in Hyjal (not mentioning all those previously needed to get attuned to SSC and TK first) just to get attuned to Black Temple while there's an open hole in BT wall where you can just walk in...<br />
<br />
But Karazhan attunement is (was) from my point of view different. It fits perfectly the story, it made sense!<br />
<br />
As I said, I don't care about people getting to Karazhan without doing 4 easy instances on normal mode (omg hard! too much time needed, i want to have a life). But I can already see the trade channel spammed with LFG1M for Karazhan - we need a key :)<br />
<br />
In fact, deep inside I'm starting to giggle at all those groups. <br />
At Moroes: <br />
- Oh, I need repairs.<br />
- Go down and repair at guy in stables.<br />
- We didn't clear those mobs, remember?<br />
- Oh right, lets all go down and kill them.<br />
- FFS this game is bugged, I can't repair here. Fucking stupid Blizzard. I can't believe I'm paying for this game!<br />
- Are you honored with Violet Eye?<br />
- What? I'm not even friendly dude, this is my first instance ever. What are you talking about?<br />
- Omg you noob, go and repair in Duskwood.<br />
..... after 10 minutes .... <br />
- Guys, can someone come outside and open me the door?<br />
- No we can't, the guy with key already left. We payed him 10g to open for us at the beginning...<br />

<br />
I'm not gonna bother much with the pro casual propaganda that blizz is holding up... but I did feel the urge to reply to this one:<br />
<br />
That's the entire thing you mentioned... getting attuned to kara takes one night. It's flipping b#llsh#t to make life even more easier. Getting attuned isn't the hardest thing and still it had to be removed ... &quot;to let casuals play the end game instances&quot;, the logic in that idea is beyond retarded.<br />
<br />
Sure admitted getting attuned to BT/MH is a bit overdone, same for TK/SSC (tho imho the TK one was pretty easy). Imho attunements like the kara one are the way you should get attuned, just look at pre-tbc. None of the attunements required anything from other raid instances, this made it alot better for guilds. Easier to get raiders that want to raid and not just want to tag along (hey you had to put effort into getting attuned right? so that's already a bonus) and easier to get people in guild attuned, seeing you aren't forced to go through a raidinstance while you are just trying to get a major boss down. <br />
<br />
<br />
ps about the ppl stating that you need a life to raid, my guess is you yourselves don't have a life already so not much changes. Besides that, alot of raiders have perfectly good lifes. I for one have a good job and nice girlfriend.. go out regularly and still I keep up with the raiders... in my guild there is a husband and wife.. who kept up a family life too... so comments like that are utter bull.<br />
<br />
you don't need to be a superhuman to raid and that's the problem.. there's no challenge anymore<br />
<br />
and ofc the comment &quot;Wow is a game&quot; ... not anymore... a game offers challenge, a goal to do, obstacles to conquer. <br />
<br />
Current WoW offers: ... grind...grind...grind..hey epic... grind...grind...grind...look another epic<br />
Future WoW offers: ... well the same, just with a few less grinds 'cause it's far too hard for some people</div></div><hr />

Ridiculous. Attunements are only timesink-methods. If someone can actually beat a boss, then he/she deserves the loot. Karahzan is btw. the entry-lvl-instance. Epic =/= Epic. If you look at Karazhan-Epics and at Sunwell-Epics, i hope you see a little difference... I don't see some Newbies zone into Sunwell when 2.4 arrives, and kill all bosses. ::) and please don't start now to cry about the new badge loot. these are only loose items, which require much effort/time to achieve.</div></div><hr />

The foundation of wow is breaking and breaking rapidly that's what pains me... not even looking at raiding perse, but it's the easiest example at the moment.<br />
<br />
Let's delve into something other than raiding if you want other examples:<br />
25 daily's per day... what does that mean? that with a good run you can have an epic flying mount in 20 days... with doing &quot;nothing&quot; (and believe me, compared to grinding for an epic flying mount a few dailys is considered nothing)<br />
<br />

The foundations of WoW are the Casuals... if they would leave, Blizzard couldn't effort to carry on the servers and the development of new content. So they have to make the game more casual. And like I said, there is more then enough content for hardcore gamers... who are still favored by Blizzard, because they get new content first. After a while, blizzard has to nerf the old content, to please the casuals, but thats ok, because they build new, difficult content. this is a easy and economic way to try to please all customers. in fact, they _could_ make exclusive content only for hardcore gamers, and easy content for casuals. but that would cost much more money, and that would just be uneconomical. its all about money.</div></div><hr />

as you see game does not have to pertain challenge. as fro WoW I wouldn't compare Timesinks as challenge, anything and I mean anything can be obtained given enough time, but why shoud a GAME consume an individual's life? Just cause EQ and other find it necessary for things to take forever and a day, and appeal to the Minority does not mean every company has to adapt this philosophy. This is clearly what Blizzard wants for its customer base and with 10 million and growing, who could honestly argue with that, they clearly know what they are doing. No other company can even get close to that. So if you find your self in the minority of Elitist A-holes that want to condemn other people (even tho they pay the same fee to play the very same game you do.) cause after a year and some change months they get to do it easier and quicker then the people before them. Then perhaps you should go to those games where where your Soul is the price to play the game. This change is another absurd thing to cry over, those leet sauce guilds out there could care less about kara. All this will be obsolete in a few months where its for the most part dead content, so why not try to push more people through this? Blizzard has already said its made mistakes in the past trying to please the 5-10% of the WoW pop so guess what, this is the road we are going down, buck and get used to it. <br />

By no means does that take away from the game, just your own dilusional sense of it.</div></div><hr />

You say &quot;there is more then enough content for hardcore gamers&quot;... no there isn't. ALL content is beyond casual... downing Illidan is nothing compared to even GETTING to Kel'thuzad.<br />
<br />
Supression room in BWL &gt; Supression room in BT.<br />
<br />
I can bet you a months pay that I can have a full BT guild up within 3 months, with just casuals.<br />
<br />
<br />
And why should Blizzard care about such people like you, who think BT isn't hardcore enough? you are only a small minority, i'm sorry to tell you that. its uneconomical to develop content for you.</div></div><hr />

You can't twist weapon buffs, you can only have one at a time and it will not be removed until the 10s buff has expired, even if you kill the totem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and ofc a reply to legendsndreamz..just a bit too much to quote<br />
<br />
1. we're less of a minority than people think, blizz (and ofc you) look at the numbers who killed illidan, and ofc we all know that that are the numbers we should look at... seeing &quot;hardcore&quot; equals &quot;killing illidan&quot;.. (btw before you use that as an argument: yes I've downed Illidan, and yes I was highly dissapointed in the quality of the fight)<br />
<br />
2. if all end game challenge is gone.. what's next? please the people that think current end game challenge is too hard? (even if it's just heroics) that's what I mean with breaking down... <br />
<br />
3. again the numbers you raise are biased, you're including all people that hear the numbers that's growing and &quot;want to try it out&quot; ... as a firm law in economics, statistics are volatile and not reliable. Blizzard is making the game easier to get that easy buck, but in the long run they will lose alot of customers. Scoring 1 time a good buck is worth a heck lot less than having a steady income.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. a competitive activity involving skill, chance, or endurance on the part of two or more persons who play according to a set of rules, usually for their own amusement or for that of spectators.<br />
<br />
sounds to me you play doom3 with godmode on... or even viva pinata with ...euh... tbh I only saw VP on a friend's xbox so don't know that much about it... but anyway play viva pinata with the mode to make it easier...<br />
<br />
<br />
that's where wow is heading to... easymode for all<br />
<br />
<br />
they clearly know what they are doing. <br />
<br />
Not even close... they struck gold and have no clue how to handle it. That's where it is going wrong.<br />
<br />
A few other games had this exact development cycle. A few other games were popular... but all died in the long run due to this error... or do people still play Star Wars Galaxies after the CU? or Ultima Online? both were BIG players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
like somewhere in the 2%..<br />
<br />
lol..<br />
<br />
<br />
2% downed illidan yes.. but how many are on council? how many even set foot in BT? or MH? or even SSC/TK? THOSE are raiding guilds... &quot;elitists&quot; &quot;hardcore&quot; &quot;those with no life&quot; etc...etc..<br />
<br />
quick glimpse at wowjutsu, 41350 &quot;ranked guilds&quot; ... how much is 41350 * 25? 1033750 ... that's 2%? <br />
<br />
ok granted some are karazhan..and I do think karazhan is a &quot;worth to mention&quot; raid instance...but I can see how karazhan can be branded as a non raid instance.</div></div><hr />

Ehm... no. You said, that BT is too easy for hardcore gamers. That implicates that these &quot;hardcore&quot; gamers already cleared bt/hyjal. and why should someone in ssc cry about these changes? there is still bt/hyjal and sunwell waiting for him.</div></div><hr />

1. First yes you guys are a very small minority, sure that number may seem large, but so does 10,000,000 Customers. your all mighty BT Farm guilds aren't that big anymore. This is just one source to give an approx % of what guilds are doing out there. Check the margin. http://www.wowjutsu.com/world/ yup, pretty small %. I guarantee that most of these people really could care less of the changes. it comes down to even the more much smaller % of the wow pop that is the Extreme Elitist, which you seem to be supporting. <br />

2. If you don't find this game challenging or ever have, and that is what you are here for, why are you paying $15 a month to play it? move on spare us your very negative insulting comments that have no backbone. There is an amplitude of reasons all of us play and I assure you its not to JUST be challenged. The whole reason I dropped the deff for Game is to emphasize the Fun aspect of it. <br />
<br />
as for a little background of the person your arguing with, I play 12-16 hours a day, 7 days a week. Ive got 9 70's Alliance side, and 9 70's Horde side. One of each class. Done the raiding thing built and had help guilds be strong raiding guils. Several Epic flyers, I could go on the list is long. Ill save you the time, my point Im one of the very few hardcore hardcore players out there. Yet Im not bitching about changes of a game that wont matter in a couple months anyhow. Heck few years down the road non of this wont matter. My point? Its a game, enjoy it and stop crying. Elevate yourself from being one of the lowest evolve people in our society. Cause not all people can be the exception to the rule, and not everyone who has more then WoW going on in their life can afford to sacrifice things for that.

Cute, no really. I like how you think those non competitors even in the same field. Guess what even if they did struck gold, they are now harnassing and going on 3 years strong. Also Blizzard is not some nub company they been around the block. They have blockbuster games, why? Cause they know what they are doing. The majority of the players base that has and is continuing to still play those old titles will say yes these games kick ass. WoW is fine and the day it dies, is when Blizzard has something better that has come along and no longer wishes to support it.</div></div><hr />

UO had a larger fanbase than WoW... check your history books... and lived a HECK lot longer than WoW <br />
<br />
SWG, not sure... I mentioned it 'cause I played it ofc... I know it was big.. just not how... and I know that every single fan quit due to the CU.. but SWG lived also beyond the 3 years<br />
<br />
<br />
they are non competitors simply due to the same mistakes that WoW is making</div></div><hr />

LOL losing this conversation? hardly. I used Nazi cause it just fits so smoothly with people such as yourself and your attitude towards life. I could come up with more examples, but I really dont have the desire to invest more time into someone who has a lot of maturing yet to do. <br />
<br />
If you quit, why do you continue to read and post here? Id be really surprised if you had quit. If you did so what, not going to hurt blizzard any, and just cause this game does not meet your needs does not mean its failing. Who made you the authority? see how all these examples continue to tie into the Nazi motto's and way of life.<br />
<br />
BTW nothing is hard about getting an epic flyer, anyone with time can do this, and very easily. 5 days 6 hours a day doing quests will get you the majority of it. then do a little farming no big deal. bam epic bird. as for what I think down the road? Id be saying they should have changed this much sooner so my alts can get on this =P but o well, I had bragging rights all the while. Non of this is meant to last, the game is continually evolving your toon(s) continue to do so. Should we cry that MC is no longer difficult? lo no, use this idea and apply it. you will continually be disappointed in life.</div></div><hr />

That's the thing, it's not hard to get an epic flyer, had one on my main and alt.. why should it be made easier?<br />
<br />
MC turning easy, well that's level restrictions, it's actualy logical that lower lvl dungeons get easier. &quot;'cause people think it's hard&quot; isn't really a good reason.. <br />

and yes it's a shame I can't do MC/BWL as a lvl 70 dungeon.. they were quite good</div></div><hr />

Thank you for you challenge, as you will see you have no point. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultima_online http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Galaxies Not even close!!! lol you should do your own research before you attempt to make other look foolish.<br />
<br />
As for Timeline, sure UO started originally and opened the door for other MMO's good for them, but Blizzard is evolving the concept of MMO's. I.E. Ford first to mass produced Automobiles with the Model T, but we are not driving that today are we? I only bring this up since you want to compare apples and oranges, as well as emphasize my point further.</div></div><hr />

Well if the shoe fits...I could use KKK if you like they are of the same ilk. BTW both parties are still around today. You should really pick up a news paper once in a while. You also contradicted yourself in the same sentence with Epic bird, not challenging, and made easier. The land mounts got discounted a couple times, If you have been playing that long you will remember that. Simple answer TIME, enough time has passed things should depreciate. Could use the car example again, Car values not only depreciate once they leave the lot but naturally over time as well. Same concept. Stop living in the past (if your gonna hang there at least educate yourself more over it.) Move on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all reasearch that took maybe 2 minutes, which btw you have not issued any sources. That era? for christs sakes man it was 10 years ago, The internet was thriving, How old are you? now if UO was dated back in the late 70's sure that pathetic argument could have some ground to walk on. Those Subscriptions were reported peaks of their timeline, from their own company. As for that % gap you gave, (which seems very lofty) even if those were accurate It shows nothing, at the time UO Lead the way as the first MMO thus ya its new and different, its the only thing out there. guess what yup its gonna Monopolize the market. Your continuing to compare Apples to Oranges.<br />

again yer having problems with reading, <br />
<br />
let me put it in kid latin for you:<br />
- get birdy = easy<br />
- blizz will probably make birdy get more easy.. so even 10 year olds can play it (you perhaps?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The land mounts got discounted a couple times, If you have been playing that long you will remember that. <br />
true, but that doesn't mean it was usefull..<br />

<br />
yeh and ofc we see everyone driving around in a 10 year old ferrari, lotus, lambo, etc (whatever floats your boat) ;)<br />

Non of your points prove anything and still have no ground. Mounts are luxuries nothing more discounting does not = easy, just means less time spent.

Jeopardy theme plays, your starting to prove your quite young, or very incompetent or both? Broadband has nothing to do with the usage of the internet.

Dude just stop, really, you clearly have no knowledge of this what so-ever. Its difficult to imagine from today's standards, but That was common life back then. So if i can confidently say this, guess that makes me older then 10.

Anyways Im through with you little one, come back when you can not only hold your own, but back up your arguments, your out of your league.<br />

Since you have not shown to be able to carry an intelligible debate, and have shown your nothing better then a forum troll, I end this rounds with you. Good day to you sir.<br />

<br />
That's the entire thing you mentioned... getting attuned to kara takes one night. It's flipping b#llsh#t to make life even more easier. Getting attuned isn't the hardest thing and still it had to be removed ... &quot;to let casuals play the end game instances&quot;, the logic in that idea is beyond retarded.<br />
<br />
Sure admitted getting attuned to BT/MH is a bit overdone, same for TK/SSC (tho imho the TK one was pretty easy). Imho attunements like the kara one are the way you should get attuned, just look at pre-tbc. None of the attunements required anything from other raid instances, this made it alot better for guilds. Easier to get raiders that want to raid and not just want to tag along (hey you had to put effort into getting attuned right? so that's already a bonus) and easier to get people in guild attuned, seeing you aren't forced to go through a raidinstance while you are just trying to get a major boss down. <br />
<br />
<br />
ps about the ppl stating that you need a life to raid, my guess is you yourselves don't have a life already so not much changes. Besides that, alot of raiders have perfectly good lifes. I for one have a good job and nice girlfriend.. go out regularly and still I keep up with the raiders... in my guild there is a husband and wife.. who kept up a family life too... so comments like that are utter bull.<br />
<br />
you don't need to be a superhuman to raid and that's the problem.. there's no challenge anymore<br />
<br />
and ofc the comment &quot;Wow is a game&quot; ... not anymore... a game offers challenge, a goal to do, obstacles to conquer. <br />
<br />
Current WoW offers: ... grind...grind...grind..hey epic... grind...grind...grind...look another epic<br />
Future WoW offers: ... well the same, just with a few less grinds 'cause it's far too hard for some people<br />
<br />
<br />
After reading your post im convinced your life just isnt complete without something to bitch about. Non-casuals are the first to berate casuals in karazhan that it &quot;isn't really a raid&quot; and how easy it is, and they get thier panties all twisted when they remove the attunement. When i read anything about blizzard just handing epics to people i get the rediculous Benny Hill music playing in my head and think, &quot;Are they joking, or just retarded?&quot; Sure, its easier to get epics nowadays, but who cares? Please stop worrying so much about your epeen. If your downing Illidan and Vashj and Kael, then gratz. Your doing more than i ever had the patience for. But if your pissed off about other people having epics, you just need to shut the hell up already. Its the most childish thing ive ever seen, Im angry because he has the same toy i has. I got all the golden skulls in Halo 3 and got the samurai armor. Am I angry at other people who found all the skulls by looking at youtube videos? No. Thats thier thing.<br />

<br />
Don't you understand that 'casuals' will only wipe, and then wipe some more, on the trash before Attumen? The real casual players simply won't see these 'free epics' because they are not organised (and interested) enough to even down the first Kara boss, or do heroics for that matter. Casuals are simply not good and/or skilled and/or interested enough to do (and farm) heroics. They won't get badges, let alone the amount of badges needed for the new t6 stuff. <br />
<br />
Players who ARE organised enough WILL kill Kara bosses, but they will have had no problem attuning themselves in the first place. Players who ARE organised enough WILL farm heroics for badges. The rest just won't or can't. Bringing in more epic rewards does not change this. <br />
<br />
In other words: <br />
<br />
These changes are mostly ment for raider alts, who can now skip the boring instancing and fly through Kara to get their initial epics. Introducing new epics for badges simply allows the 'lesser' raiding guilds to ease progress towards the more difficult raid content - raid content Blizzard put a lot of work in and does not want to reserve for the top 0,5% of all players. Raid content Blizzard wants you to see before WotLK comes out. <br />
<br />
Otherwise we'll have another Naxx or AQ40; huge and fun raid dungeons hardly anyone has seen the inside of except the happy hardcore few.</div></div><hr />

Also, it's easier to make a raid strategy if you did complete the attunement, since you know what bosses you should expect.<br />
Is the game based on loads of people having fun while they play together, or is it bosses loot that matters nowdays?</div></div><hr />

You seem to have gotten the majority of it correct. Watch out for the nerd raging casuals.<br />
<br />
Btw i feel the need to mention that if you do check Wowjutsu it comes up with 2.5milllion people who raid, but sure thats like 2% of 10 million right? I am glad so many people lack mathematical skills in this day and age, feel free to pull out those calculators.</div></div><hr />

Only hand them out in the 25-mans and the 10 mans and 5 man heroics should get high quality Blue gear. The reason people get made is because in Pre-BC having an Epic meant you put time into it. Casuals didn't need to know the ilvl or where it dropped from simply that you had Epics and that meant you put your time into achieving that. Now a casual can get Epics and has no clue if someone elses drop was from Karazhan or Black Temple. I can certainly see the non-casual (clearing Karazhan is a 3 hour adventure for those of even decent awareness, and is extremely casual friendly, but) view point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this whole &quot;hardcore&quot;-thing is refering to people who cleared BC. And thats just 4% of all players who are recorded by wowjutsu (this number is btw wrong and smaller, if you look at how much people on wowjutsu are raiding karazhan you get nearly 100 percent, thats simply not true). these are the people who are ranting about such indifferent topics. casuals = 5 mans / heroics / kara / ssc /tempest keep / zul aman. i dont see these people much complaining about the changes. they mostly don't have such an elitist attitude like the rest...</div></div><hr />

Before you flame peoples mathematical skills you should probably know what you are talking about. Just because you raid doesn't make you hardcore. The 2% is in reference to those labeled &quot;hardcore&quot;.<br />

Meaning about 5 - 7.5 million consisting of players on the Asian realms which Wowjutsu doesn't track. And a large number of guilds that never killed anything in karazhan, or are simply low level guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
People are actually flaming imaginary people that being hardcore are complaining about Karazhan attunement being removed.<br />
<br />
So it seems that actual people - not imaginary ones - either:<br />
<br />
a) agree - good for alts<br />
b) Mildly disagree on the grounds of lore/continuity<br />
c) Couldn't care less<br />
<br />
The c) class seems to actually represent most people. I'm a bit halfway between b) and c) due to the fact the Kara attunement did make sense from a continuity POV, it was quite reasonable, and you could do it alone/PUGging, unlike the TK, BT and MH attunements that were mere pacing mechanisms. Guess the Blizz sponsored killing of normal 5 man is one of the reasons for it to end.<br />
<br />
Altogether I blame MrSimtang for his funny post, that deserves at least a 7/10. Too bad some people seem to have their irony detector offline while their flaming system is so alert that even attacks imaginary foes.</div></div><hr />

(Here in Ohio it's pretty cold, so it's nice to have a consistent source of heat.) I have to say, I really thought the elitists on here would be totally indifferent to Kara attunement. I &quot;get&quot; where they're coming from on the Hyjal/BT stuff, but right now I'm within the last 1000g of the long farm for an epic flying mount and can see that if WotLK lowers the cost I will feel slightly annoyed. However I will also look at my bank account at that point and realize how much faster I've accrued money over the months I had my mount before it became widely available.<br />
<br />
I applaud the hardcore raiders on their achievement in clearing BC so quickly. The fact still remains that you guys have had months upon months to /flex in the IF bank area. Sunwell will be starting up and you'll have the chance to do it again with that content. Why the anger at Blizzard allowing more people to experience this content that many of you have been bored of and see as no great feat? Since 2.4 news started showing up (and before that the lifting of SSC/TK attunement), I've come to realize one thing. Any elitist on here that posts anger towards casuals is beyond a shadow of a doubt an egomaniacal loot whore. It's cut and dry. The ONLY reason to be upset is that you are no longer able to show off your gear and accomplishments to others. WoW isn't a game built with bragging rights as it's core. If you assume it to be, you will end up frustrated (as many of you have been). <br />
<br />
The anger, hate and general &quot;my dad is better than your dad&quot; attitude that floods these news posts is incredible. Shouldn't we be excited about these things? I just don't get it...<br />
<br />
Also, please note above that I use &quot;hardcore&quot; in an exclusively mutual manner from &quot;elitist.&quot; I have many friends who are full T6 and endgame that are hardcore. What they aren't, however, are elitists that tell me because I can't play on a regular schedule that I am in some way undeserving of the game's purples.</div></div><hr />

unfortunately as fun as that sounds this doesn't work, weapon buff totems buff the mainhand weapon with a 7ish second mini enchant that works like poisons or weapon stones, so if you're shaman twisted totems you'd have to also actively remove the first 7 second weapon buff to get the next one to apply.

rofl how many people had internet in the LATE 90's, hmm i know that a decade seems like a while ago, but some of us still remember, but just to give sources lets go with wiki again. <br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet#Creation<br />
&quot;During the 1990s, it was estimated that the Internet grew by 100% per year, with a brief period of explosive growth in 1996 and 1997.&quot;<br />
<br />
Numbers only went up as time goes on, wow sure didn't have 10 million people opening year, but in the year 2000 i'm pretty sure UO probably didn't have as many people playing as wow did by the end of it's first year. And if you didn't have the internet by the year 2000 you probably weren't the type of person that was going to play it anyhow.</div></div><hr />

while i don't think you're far off, your missing a couple of opportunities with the totem. With rogues, yes they have their poisons, and if the totem wasn't so easy to get rid of and/or the shaman who is laying it wasn't so easy to lock down and kill then it would mean they go from needing to use a poison they have to apply 5x times to be as effective as a warrior, to just making sure that they always land a hit with their MH weapon. so as far as getting the full effect on faster it helps in that way, (also could consider team makups as far as if you have a lot of magic dispel, that is if the flametounge debuff counts as magic or not, or if the other team has a lot of poison dispell.) Fury warriors could actually go into an arena and apply the debuff that makes all warriors go MS. shaman would will most likely always just have the weapon buff applied, on a fast off hand if you're enhance or on the main hand if your healer/shocker. However with as easy as it is for shammies to get locked down i wouldn't see any non enhance sham going in for debuff hits unless they've killed 2-3 of the dps and just have persistent healers to deal with. <br />
<br />
So no, not totally worthless, but not really anything any shamans have been pining for. I mean it makes me think of the patch with the hunter buff to include MS with aimed shot. I havn't spent any time at the hunter forums but i would assume that there, like the shaman forum and other forums, there were threads about possible talent/spell changes that could help hunters be viable. I doubt many of them included adding MS to aimed shot. Again not really a bad buff but one that had a lot of hunters thinking....&quot;uh, ok well i guess i'll take that&quot; not feeling like it's crappy so much as totally unexpected/out of left field.<br />
<br />
If you want to ask about the worthlessness of something, it's the addition to movement speed change to toughness. Ok, so take a talent that used to be worthless in pvp and pve (pvp because it didn't help enough to justify wasting 5 points and pve because your wearing half leather/mail anyhow and it wouldn't keep you from getting 1-2 shot by mobs in the raids.) and to this you are going to add a reduction to movement impairing effects by 50%...now admittedly i too jumped to a &quot;wow 50% is a high percentage! it must be good&quot; but once i got to thinking about it. it's more of a kick in the ass than a helping hand.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh you're enhancement eh? you want to pvp and pve? RESPEC every time you want to pve and pvp if you want to take advantage of the new talent&quot; But even if you were to respec, thats 5 more points you need to throw into a sub par talent. <br />
<br />
whether you run using the http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=hZxVbdVzsAuqox0ez<br />
which would at least give you 3 floating talents to spend.<br />
or something like this (if anyone does)<br />
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=hgczL0bZxVbdVzsAuqo<br />
you're left having to pull points out of the top of enhancement which are considered to be pretty much must haves to get 5 points into a talent that doesn't decrease the chance you are actually impaired (and doesn't help at all with stun/fear/cc lock ups) but only decreases how long you're effected. now if you look at the numbers. your hamstring goes from 15 seconds to 7.5, crippling from 12 - 6, frost bolt i think from 7-3.5, all of these things take one global cooldown to reapply (except frost bolt of course which slows + damage + the slow from ice armor from just attacking the mage in the first place) anyhow the point is, these things get re applied long before their duration is up, and even with the 5 point talent they STILL can be re applied long before their half duration is up.<br />
<br />
It does nothing to address the issue with enhance not being able to get to the target and ele/resto getting away from the target. So it's one of those things where it looks awesome when you first see it, then you get it and realize it's more effective/noticeable in some situation like when the shade of aran sucks everyone in for the arcane explosion...if it even would work in that situation. <br />
<br />
Instant ghostwolf with talents had a bunch of shammies hoping, but with no way to break the impairing effects int the first place, it's just a talented ability to shift into an incredibly slow moving wolf. about the only times where this is more useful would be if you're trying to chase a druid carrying the flag...so long as they don't have improved cheetah talent, or the move speed set bonus (i know that was taken off but i thought it was put back on...if not then revoke that statement) or unless they have natures grasp so that after you slow them, shift and bite them you end up insta-rooted while they shift out of your frost shock and run away.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the attention, that things are actually being changed, however It feels more like Blizzard is making the changes based on this sort of thinking :<br />
&quot;Damnit people suggested a lot of interesting and good ideas on the forums (yes along with numerous idiotic and o/p suggestions), we don't want them taking any credit for adding a helpful change.....I know, give them MS! MS fixes everything and we take all the credit for an original fix to the issues!&quot; <br />
<br />
It's like trying to stop a forest fire from destroying your house by burning your house down first so the fire doesn't get the satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Like i said i appreciate the attention, but i hope they really think things through and play around with some other options that will actually address the core issues surrounding shaman viability in pvp since addressing those will help all 3 specs become more viable, not just making one viable until WoTLK comes out by adding random ass shot in the dark style buffs.<br />

I don't think that you don't deserve some type of gear if you can' put play as much as those of us that have cleared the instances but I do think it is very unjustified in people who play and do significantly less than the BT/Hyjal raiders get easy access to comparable gear. In my opinion I could care less about kara attunement being removed but I still won't agree on anything near the item level of BT/Hyjal loots being given to people who go no farther than that.</div></div><hr />

I might have misunderstood you here, and I easily could have (your sentence structure and grammar are shaky at best), but I'm pretty sure that's what you're saying. In that case, please remember that between jobs, families and life in general, not everyone is going to have the same time to invest. <br />
<br />
Also, you missed a key point of my post. You think it is &quot;unjustified in people who play and do significantly less than the BT/Hyjal raiders get easy access to comparable gear.&quot; Finish your thought and it would have &quot;...after we received a full year's head start on them.&quot;</div></div><hr />

movement impairing effects is it just slow effects ore is it evrything that prevents you from move(like Frst nove, roots, ice trap)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i haven't tried it yet but i would assume only slowing, things classified as roots probably will not apply, but as i said i have not tested this so it might.<br />
<br />
if it does, it would at least make it marginally better than it is now.</div></div><hr />

There is the hot topic issue right there that I at least think Blizzard is addressing and looking to change, Time spent. Of course they have to weigh Reasonable time spent vs challenge. Keep recurring accounts active long as possible. Keep the majority of your customers happy. That in mind I believe Blizz is trying to knock out a lot of this usless time sink stuff. Unfair to those who have done it already?...maybe. As you look at the game as a whole time line you can see Blizz is moving in this way. Agree/Disagree all you want. I would think many people would be happy to play a game that doesn't demand your soul. However if your looking to just submit your soul EQ is still taking them.</div></div><hr />

Nothing about raiding demands your soul, if you are in a good raiding guild then you don't raid more than 2 or 3 days a week, of course 8 hours a week is so my soul.<br />
<br />
On another note I especially love when people who have no solid argument against you so they go to grammar, grats you have no point.</div></div><hr />

To save myself and other readers from yet another troll looking for pointless dribble, let me make my post more clear, as you completely missed the point. I was referring to the game as a whole, which yea it does demand quite a bit of time to be successful and see the entire game. As for raiding, A premier guild that is decked out as a raid as a whole, and have the content on farm, sure its a breeze. For those who learning and going through it takes much longer, to deny that is just foolish. Add in the Raid prep, Repair funds etc, that is just raiding. Throw in alts and Playing for Fun (strange concept this fun, as it seems to be forgotten by most.) and you have my point.</div></div><hr />
