Disenchanting &amp; Shattering Hotfix<br />
Disenchanting and shattering will be hotfixed shortly, it might be a good time to get rid of the extra Infinite Dust you have in your bags. <br />
Earlier today we made a post in our Service Status forum (linked below) noting that a hotfix was being applied that would yield more materials for enchanters when disenchanting or shattering items. For those of you who may be waiting for this hotfix to disenchant some leftover items, please note that the hotfix has been delayed. We still plan to push this hotfix in the near future and will inform the community when this happens.<br />

Regarding the Sinister Calling Achievement<br />
We wanted to take a moment to clarify how the Sinister Calling achievement works for Hallow’s End. The text says that both a Hallowed Helm and a Sinister Squashling pet need to be “obtained” for the achievement to be complete. More specifically, the pet needs to be learned and become part of your pet spell book for that part to be complete. The Hallowed Helm on the other hand needs to be looted by the character to fulfill that aspect of the achievement.<br />
<br />
We apologize for any confusion in this matter and hope you enjoy the rest of Hallow’s End! <br />

Developer Chat on Twitter<br />
Cataclysm<br />
Q: Will Path of the Titans be as time consuming as obtaining Sons of Hodir reputation?<br />
A: Sons of Hodir was easy, we're thinking more along the lines of Argent Dawn rep actually. JK! As a matter of fact, we don't want the paths of the titans to feel grindy at all so we're trying to make sure that each step along the way feels more like a great quest, or a key achievement (like killing all the bosses in a new raid zone). So, it should be more oriented around accomplishing something that feels important rather than grinding. <br />
<br />
Q: What’s Deathwing’s current relationship with the Old Gods?<br />
A: In facebook terms, I'd list it as &quot;It's Complicated&quot;. &quot;Single&quot; or &quot;Married&quot; are probably too extreme in this case. <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be Wintergrasp-like capturable zones in Cataclysm?<br />
A: Yes, there is an island off the coast of the Eastern Kingdoms named Tol Barad. Players will fight for control of the island and its famous prison. However, while the battle for Tol Barad is not in progress, players will find that it will remind them much more of the Isle of Quel'Danas, in that it'll be a major daily quest hub with quite a bit of random world pvp (presumably). <br />
<br />
Q: Thousand Needles is getting a big change in levels; how has the Cataclysm affected it?<br />
A: As a result of the Cataclysm, Thousand Needles has been completely flooded with water! <br />
<br />
Q: With Cataclysm revisiting the old world, any plan to make the old reputations worthwhile again?<br />
A: With each expansion, we introduce new reputations with new rewards. Sometimes we introduce reputations that are obviously related, such as Argent Dawn/Argent Crusade and Cenarion Circle/Cenarion Expedition. We don’t update the rewards for existing reps, as we don’t want to put new characters at such a significant disadvantage. <br />
<br />
Q: With the removal of defense in Cataclysm, will plate gear still have avoidance stats or will tanks and dps be sharing?<br />
A: Tanking gear will still have avoidance stats, they just won't have the defense stat anymore. So to answer your question, tanking and dps gear will not be the same. <br />
<br />
Q: Any plans of doing anything with Grim Batol in the Wetlands?<br />
A: Yes, we currently plan for Grim Batol to be one of the raid zones in Cataclysm. =] <br />
<br />
Q: What are the plans for the current Goblin-run towns after Cataclysm is out?<br />
A: Most Goblin-run towns will continue to operate as normal. In general, the existing Goblin cartels tend to be self-serving, and therefore aren't taking sides. <br />
<br />
Patch 3.3<br />
Q: There's plenty of great endgame content, what about some new early/mid content to keep new players entertained?<br />
A: We actually have some small changes to the early game going live in 3.3.0 to help eliminate some new player confusion. This is not content specific, it is more focused around easing the new player pain. <br />
<br />
Q: Will leveling from 80-85 be like leveling from 70-80?<br />
A: It's too early to say. We base our leveling more around how much quest content we have and how good the reward pacing feels. If we have as many quests as we did from 70-80 and if it feels like your character is getting a reasonable amount of new stuff for the time invested, then it could end up being similar. <br />
<br />
Q: Will players be able to do 'old world' quests after Cataclysm is released?<br />
A: Only &quot;old world&quot; quests that we don't change. However, once the Cataclysm happens, it happens for everyone and there's no going back. <br />
<br />
Q: How will you handle beginning characters and higher level friends after Cataclysm? WIll they be out of phase?<br />
Players will not be out of phase. The Cataclysm changes the world for everyone. <br />
<br />
Q: Are Worgen going to have mounts?<br />
A: Both Worgen and Goblins will have new, racial specific mounts. <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be events where ally + horde players have to work together to kill a boss?<br />
A: Generally speaking we don't do this because we prefer that the horde and alliance feel like enemies rather than a big happy family working together to defeat a common foe. If anything, we want tension between the sides to rise. <br />
<br />
Q: Will Hyjal be made for exploration in Cataclysm?<br />
A: Yes. <br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Q: Love the steps taken to making high-end content accessible to casual players. How committed are you to continuing this?<br />
A: This is something we talk about on a regular basis. There isn’t a line in the sand we have made, it’s much more on a per piece of content basis. We do like the way the regular modes are shaping up to be more casual friendly, while the hardmodes are a way to reward very hardcore play. <br />
<br />
Q: Ulduar had one kind of hard mode(triggered).. ToC had another (ToC vs TOGC).. Ony has none. What will ICC have?&quot;<br />
A: ICC's hard modes will be triggered, but via in-game UI (much like how you toggle between normal and heroic modes today) rather than triggered by game mechanics (like not killing the three drakes before you attack Sartharion). <br />
<br />
Q: For Cross-realm LFG if the group is composed by members of other realms do they have to go on foot or will they be teleported?<br />
A: The current plan is for players using the LFG system to be automatically teleported into the instance, similar to how battleground queuing works today. This is active on the PTR now, and we plan to host a community event around this feature soon! <br />
<br />
Q: Any chance to have LFG menu to show classes you're looking for I.E just showing all tanks or healers currently qued in LFG.<br />
A: The plan right now is to allow players to register for roles they are capable of filling, then have the queue system make the best decision possible for the player. This is to give all classes an equal chance at participation. We also have plans to diversify the class makeup in a future PTR update. <br />
<br />
Q: With T10, are we going to see tokens like in Ulduar? or like CC? CC style had every class and spec rolling on same thing.<br />
A: With t10 we're going to see a hybrid. The tier 10 items (the ones with item levels you'd find in the 10-player raid) will be purchased with Emblems of Frost.<br />
<br />
The tier 10.5 items (the ones with item levels you'd find in the 25-player raid) will be obtained by getting a token (one that is specific to 3 or 4 classes, much like the ulduar tokens) and using it to upgrade the tier 10 item that was purchased with emblems of frost. <br />
<br />
Q: Will there be anymore epic storylines with cinematics like the wrathgate questline?<br />
A: We have big plans for additional in game cinematics! We are happy with how the Wrathgate questline worked out, and want to do more lines like this. <br />
<br />
Q: May I create a group with 4 friends and then use the LFG interface to gain the random dungeon reward?<br />
A: Yes. In fact, you can join it with a full group of 5 and still get the random dungeon reward. The reward is for doing a random dungeon, not necessarily for having random members. <br />
<br />
Q: Crowd control is all but dead in raids. Is that something you plan on bringing back?<br />
A: Like say... with the Faction Champions encounter in ToC? ;] <br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to open the other &quot;sanctums&quot; in Wyrmrest (i.e. Obsidian Sanctum, Azure Sanctum, Emerald Sanctum)?<br />
A: Possibly. =] <br />
<br />
Q: Are hardmodes going to get anything to make them feel like a different fight visually or auditory<br />
A: I find the hard modes very different visually. Much more black and white imo. <br />
<br />
Q: Any chance that the hybrid system that is going to be implemented for T10, could be retro fitted to all WotLK raids?<br />
A: I'll take that as a good reaction to the t10 system. =] However, it unfortunately won't be retroactively applied. <br />
<br />
Q: Will 10-man raiding guilds see Legendary quality weapons (items) drop in their raids anytime soon? Or in Cataclysm?<br />
A: Our current plan is to reserve Legendary weapons for the 25 person encounters, I wouldn’t rule it out in the future though. <br />
<br />
Q: Any plans for a gated system in IIC like in Colliseum that prevents us from doing hardmodes from day 1?<br />
A: We do have a system that unlocks bosses similar to how we handled TOC and Sunwell. We are restricting hard modes to raid leaders that have defeated Arthas in regular mode. <br />
<br />
Q: In the future will hard modes have greater fidelity like Sarth, Sarth+1, Sarth+2, Sarth+3 rather than the Binary Normal/Hard?<br />
A: Generally we have learned that hard modes should be more binary, but that doesn’t mean we will never do something like Sarth 3 drakes again. <br />
<br />
Misc.<br />
Q: When Race change is live will we be able to change to any race in our faction no matter what class we are?<br />
A: No, you can only Race Change to a race that allows your specific class. <br />
<br />
Q: Any chance the Legendary items will grow stronger as players level up as heirlooms? Its too much work, just to ditch after a patch.<br />
A: This is something we have talked about a great deal. One of the concerns about making a weapon “best in the game” that scales up, is that players will continue to do old, outdated content in order to obtain the weapon. This ends up being not very fun for the other participants. While obtaining a legendary weapon is an incredible accomplishment, it is important cycle out weapons on a somewhat regular basis to make sure players are always playing new content. <br />
<br />
Q: Any chance of being able to link more then one authenticator on one account? (in case I lose or break one)<br />
A: We are talking about the authenticator and how to make it a better experience. Your suggestion is one we are talking about. <br />
<br />
Q: Do you have plans to have acheivement points redeemable?<br />
A: Achievement points are a prestige reward only. There are no plans to turn them into some kind of currency. <br />
<br />
Q: Any plans on adding bonuses to certain titles your character obtains? Like &quot;...of the alliance&quot; gives +5 to all stats<br />
A: We have no plans to introduce combat advantages to titles. Titles in World of Warcraft are very specifically set up as prestige rewards only. <br />
<br />
Q: Can locks have a summonable flying mount now please<br />
A: Now? As in right this second? No. <br />
<br />
Q: Will Alliance ever get an ingame band like the Hordes L80ETC?<br />
A: Sure, if somebody knows of an awesome Alliance band... <br />
<br />
Q: When do hunters get to tame druids?<br />
A: Right after druids get a hunter form. <br />
<br />
Q: What will happen to Mankrik's Wife? Please don't tell me she's gobbled up by the lava?<br />
A: You'll have to wait and see. =] <br />
<br />
Last question!<br />
Q: Who are the two developers answering these questions?<br />
A: Game Director Tom Chilton and Director of Production J. Allen Brack. <br />

Glory of the Ulduar Raider<br />
The same post we made on this a couple months back still applies to the situation. http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=18704852935&amp;sid=1<br />
<br />
&quot;Currently we have no plans to remove them in the foreseeable future. However, we will continue to evaluate the situation and if a decision is made to remove these rewards at any point in the future, we'll provide a one month warning so players will have time to make some final attempts. &quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/20677628001-glory-of-the-ulduar-raider.html))<br />

Cross Server LFG System<br />
While feedback is always appreciated you're making some assumptions about a system that you don't have the complete details for as of yet. This is understandable since we haven't fully explained what our intentions are or how the complete system will be working.<br />
<br />
We are in the process of finalizing just such an informational piece that we plan to post sometime early next week that should explain much more about the system, how it works, the benefits, and give you a much better foundation for providing constructive feedback during your testing and answer many of the questions that you have. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/20565929729-feedback-new-lfg-system.html))<br />
<br />
Why can't bosses have expertise?<br />
It's something we actually talk about quite a bit. We won't do it for Icecrown, but it could happen in the future.<br />
<br />
The basic problem is that bosses don't scale with gear. Their health and damage go up. That's it. You might avoid a first tier boss 30% of the time and a final tier boss 60% of the time. That means when that final boss hits you, he needs to hit for twice as much (not even counting that he already needs to hit harder to account for your higher health and armor). If you are a dps class, you might crit a low tier boss 30% of the time and a high tier boss 50% of the time. Why should you be proportionately more powerful against more powerful enemies? If anything it just makes us scale their health and damage to extreme points.<br />
<br />
Players generally expect the monsters in an RPG to get more powerful as the characters do. Otherwise the game just gets easier over time. WoW has traditionally not scaled any mob stats beyond damage done and health. I think if we always had done it nobody would think it was weird. You don't get disappointed for example that the bosses hit harder as your health goes up, so why should it be any different of the mobs hit more often as your avoidance goes up? Sunwell Radiance felt odd because it was a sudden, unpredictable addition. If things always had worked that way I think players would just have accepted it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20143777004-why-cant-bosses-have-expertise.html))<br />
<br />
Players below level 10 may not join raids<br />
One of the worst experiences a new player to WoW can have is to get invited to a raid. It immediately shuts off their ability to complete quests. Yes there are ways around that, but when you're talking about a legitimately new player who may not even have the support of friends teaching them how to play, it can just kill any progress flat. Without the starting quests, the player has no direction, no sense of their role in the game and no reasonable way to gain XP. It's even worse when done maliciously, by inviting a bunch of noobs to a raid and then dropping out. :(<br />
<br />
I am assuming many of you are like me and played games for years before trying WoW. But WoW has been around a long time now and some of the players picking up the game now don't necessarily have that experience to draw from. Beginning players these days might have come from consoles or handheld games or maybe WoW is even the first real game they've tried. These type of players need a little more direction. You'll see a lot of changes in 3.3 to support this, and then even more in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
We realize it affects the legitimate (if niche) lowbie raid case so we hope this is only a temporary solution until we implement something a little more bullet proof. <br />
<br />
[...] If we removed the quest penalty from raids, I am fairly confident that your experience upon competing say Howling Fjord and moving into Grizzly Hills would be to spam general with &quot;Hey, invite me to the raid!&quot; And there would be one. Even if you didn't technically cooperate with the folks in the zone, why not splash the XP all around a bit?<br />
<br />
Like I said, there are solutions but none of them are of the &quot;Just flip this bit and everything will be fine&quot; variety. They take a little thought and work. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/20444817276-players-below-level-10-may-not-join-raids.html))<br />

Classes<br />
Relic slot<br />
The problem with this item slot is it has now become so spec specific that we can't offer you multiple choices per tier (because we can't make that many items and ship a patch on time). So instead we try and focus on getting you to change up your gameplay, just a little, when a new relic arrives on the scene. This doesn't happen every upgrade, and it really doesn't need to. Constantly jumping around would become as predictable as never jumping at all.<br />
<br />
For Cataclysm, we're considering some different implementations of the piece. Perhaps we'll go back to putting some stats on them. It's too early to tell. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20566569695-librams-working-as-intended.html))<br />
<br />
Theorycrafting and posting numbers on forums<br />
Yeah, it's a bit of sticky wicket for us. I try to say &quot;posting with numbers makes your argument stronger,&quot; and that's true. Some players then just pop out a link to Simulationcraft or Wowmeteronline or whatever. *Nothing* is wrong with *either* of those tools when used correctly. The problem is too many players use them as the true and accurate measurement of what someone's dps really is. What someone's max dps really is is essentially unknowable. It varies a lot depending on the encounter, gear, raid synergy, the person behind the keyboard, latency, whether someone was trying to inflate the numbers, and a host of other factors. It is almost certainly *not* what *your* dps is. If you are not topping the charts, it is rarely because of the factors measured by tools such as these.<br />
<br />
So on the one hand, it feels unfair for us to say &quot;post numbers&quot; and then reply &quot;no, not those numbers&quot; when players try it. But we do ask that you consider what impact your post is going to have. There are several widely available tools, spreadsheet, simulators and websites of raid logs. Most likely the other players you are talking to, and particularly Blizzard, are familiar with them all. Ask yourself if you are really sharing new information when your post consists of a very brief &quot;See? We are low. Here is my quote or link.&quot; At the very least try and provide some analysis if you can.<br />
<br />
Not everyone is going to be an expert theorycrafter or mathematics expert, and we're not expecting you to be one in order to participate in these forum discussions. But also be honest about the fact that linking to someone else's work doesn't necessarily turn you into one either.<br />
<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Druid changes in 3.3<br />
I'm not sure why so many players who want to disagree with us on class design miss some of those posts where we attempt to clarify our position.<br />
<br />
To put it all into one place:<br />
<br />
1) Rejuv was too good. We nerfed it. The change got labeled as a bug fix, because technically it was a bug. We didn't mean to buff Rejuv's duration but once we did we didn't think it was breaking anything for a time so we let it stay. For 3.3 we decided it was breaking things and reduced the duration. We understood the confusion this caused with the community by labeling it a bug fix so we changed the patch note to no longer refer to it as a bug fix. It doesn't really matter what it was called -- it was a nerf.<br />
<br />
2) In the same patch, we decided to change Gift of the Earth Mother because it was adding a gratuitous amount of haste and at the same time making druids avoid haste where they could. We have been too generous with some of the haste talents that coupled with gear and buffs are causing problems.<br />
<br />
3) While we didn't change Gift of the Earth Mother with the express purpose of nerfing druids, it still had that effect. We considered the Rejuv nerf and the GotEM nerf and decided we liked the second one more and reverted the first one. Rejuv is back to 18 sec for 3.3.<br />
<br />
4) We realize the GotEM nerf hurt PvP Resto druids a lot and that is still something we are evaluating.<br />
<br />
5) Resto druids have a lot of heal spells. Which ones you go to the most is going to be a function of things like set bonuses, idols, your role in the group as well, as well as the encounters themselves. Druids healing the raid currently seem to use a lot of Rejuv and Wild Growth while those healing tanks use a lot of Nourish and perhaps even Lifebloom. Lifebloom still gets a lot of use in PvP. Regrowth has slipped off the radar a little, IMO, but it has been good at various points in LK and I don't think it would be that hard to bring it back (and we'll see what the GotEM change does). Bringing it back would probably slide something else down the bar, at least temporarily. We're pretty much okay with that. Healing Touch (and maybe Tranq) is the only Resto spell for which we're really not interested in carving off a major raid-healing niche. It still has situational uses with NS or in 5-player dungeons.<br />
<br />
Rereading the above, I am making sweeping generalizations a lot. Your mileage may vary and there are a ton of exceptions. One thing that hits me a lot in my position is that players assume the way they do a thing is the way everyone must do that thing. Players exhibit some pretty diverse behaviors and still get the boss down. Keep that in mind whenever you try to adopt the &quot;accepted&quot; or &quot;cookie cutter&quot; spell rotation for any class.<br />
<br />
6) Particularly angry druids like to talk about Nourish getting &quot;shoved down their throat&quot; or whatever. We added Nourish because we recognized the druid need for a &quot;Flash Heal.&quot; Healing Touch is too long to cast without NS and both NS and Swiftmend have a cooldown. The hots all do great healing, and they can definitely save someone's life, but they just aren't reliable for e.g. someone being focused by faction champions. In the BC era where we basically mandated that druids are just one arm of the healing machine that must also include paladins, priests and shamans it was okay to have a very narrow niche. In a world of 10-player raids, we want you to be able to heal with say 2 Resto druids and a Disc priest. &quot;Hey, I'm just here to hot the raid,&quot; is fine if it works for your group, but that can't be the only thing that works. (And this applies to all 5 healing specs.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20462449467-the-opinion-of--tree--take-it-or-leaf-it.html))<br />
<br />
Gift of the Earth Mother<br />
A more likely change is something like letting GotEM keep its current (PTR) functionality but also letting it reduce the GCD of just Lifebloom. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20462449467-the-opinion-of--tree--take-it-or-leaf-it.html))<br />

Warrior Scaling<br />
The solution to making warriors scale more appropriately with gear (instead of being bad at first and good later) is to normalize rage more. That's an answer that a lot of warriors hate hearing, which is one of the reasons we haven't done it yet. For many warriors, rage is a limitation to be overcome with enough gear. That's not really our vision of the class though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677858472-all-the-warriors-are-op-qq.html))</div></div><hr />

Glad you asked! IAW the community's increasingly vocal minority who love to be spoon fed every encounter, we are going to continue to make the game boring approx. 1 month after every major raid-content patch.<br />
<br />
Q: Crowd control is all but dead in raids. Is that something you plan on bringing back?<br />

Hell no! We let you mages sheep a mob or two in one encounter in ToTC!!! What more do you want! It's all about spamming interrupts and AoEing everything down, mang!<br />

Sorry, for the sarcasm, but being a slightly-hardcore turned full casual from the ease of blasting through raids, it's not filling me with hope. Frankly, and I hate to say it, but getting fed xxx amount of Emblems and having them change every few months is really getting dull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While I can't say exactly what they meant, I will explain the example for you. Without this penalty everyone in a zone (i.e. Howling Fjord) would form a raid group if they were doing quests. This raid would then enable you to keep questing where ever you like while getting credit for everyone in the raids kills / completions. <br />
<br />
Now the first two things you are probably thinking are: well you would still have to be near enough to receive credit, and it is too much effort to set up a raid just to quest. While yes you would still have to be close, you could just do a similar quest near another random person in the raid and complete two quests at once, one that you didn't actually do. To address the second point, it wouldn't be a hassle because it would become a standard. You could just ask in that zone's general for an invite to the questing raid and someone would have already formed it, passing lead to someone when the leave to keep the group going.<br />
<br />
I hope that makes sense :)<br />
<br />
As for the post about needing people to be in range / have a max number of people on the quest:<br />
<br />
You could still have more than 5 people help complete the quest without knowing it. For example if you were in one of these previously mentioned zone-wide raids and someone was farming a certain mob for a drop, and you needed that mob for a kill quest and were also killing them, you would get credit for there kills without them even knowing they were helping you. The proximity thing is an interesting idea, but I question if the engine would support that. Having the know if people are in proximity to a quest objective would require a database of all quest objective locations ready to use. Perhaps it could be possible once Blizzard finishes there in-home quest helping mod that keeps being delayed.<br />
<br />
As a final note, I thought the devs could have done a better job of avoiding answering questions which have already been answered, or at least provided a link to the Cataclysm FAQ / Info page before they started answering.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I thought this was interesting as well. Probably the biggest reveal of the session too.<br />

It basically means that you will have to buy Tier 10 with emblems of frost, then use a token similar to the ones found in Ulduar or Naxx (3/4 classes) that drops in the 25 man version to upgrade the piece you purchased with badges to Tier 10.5. It basically lets you buy the whole set without worrying that you're wasting badges by not waiting for a trophy/token.</div></div><hr />

A: With each expansion, we introduce new reputations with new rewards. Sometimes we introduce reputations that are obviously related, such as Argent Dawn/Argent Crusade and Cenarion Circle/Cenarion Expedition. We don’t update the rewards for existing reps, as we don’t want to put new characters at such a significant disadvantage. <br />

<br />
<br />
I've honestly got a big feeling that a huge portion of those are going to be taken out. Since they're basically jumping old world into the current spot in the timeline, it means that a lot of the quests will be gone, since their problem is now fixed. Obviously, they won't be able to do this with EVERYTHING, since it would take an insanely massive overhaul to get everything fitting into a perfect continuity.<br />
<br />
For example, I could see them taking The Missing Diplomat quest chain out of the game. Since the diplomat in question was Varian Wrynn, and he's now back in Stormwind, it would only make sense that the chain is out of the game (I understand that you could say the time when your character does the quest is earlier in the timeline than when Varian came back...but I think you get my point). <br />
<br />
One thing I think they wanted to do with Cataclysm (or at least the way I kind of picture it) is to totally revamp the game and advance the lore without making a WoW 2. If they WERE to make a WoW 2, it would take place in the revamped Azeroth with everything we've done so far being in the past. That would obviously make the continuity flow a little better, but this is a favorable alternative.<br />
<br />
Really, it's impossible to keep the lore perfectly straight for a new player while still having them progress through the game and old content. I guess that's just the nature of MMO's.</div></div><hr />

He's saying that if they were to make, for example, Timbermaw Hold reputation worthwile again, they would therefore added new items at those rep vendors. Players like myself, who are already exalted with that reputation, would have an advantage in that we could buy those new items instantly when we hit 85, where other players would have to grind that rep to exalted.</div></div><hr />

Not complicated. Supposed you played vanilla and are Exalted with the Torium Brotherhood, when it was actually midly usefull. I started playing in BC, when they were a bunch of dwarves that didn't sell anything interesting in a zone nobody ever went. If the brotherhood has epic items, enchants or recipes for sale in Cataclysm, then you have instant access to them as soon you ding 85, while I have to grind reputation with them as we all did with the sons of Hodir, or the Kirin Tor.</div></div><hr />

Blood Elf and Draenei required the TBC expansion to create new characters. I suspect the same goes for Goblin and Worgen in Cataclysm. Although the 4.0 patch will likely show the new character icons in the character creator, you wont be able to create one until Cataclysm is live.</div></div><hr />

Has my vote as well.<br />
If only it could keep enchants as well, but meh.<br />

The only drawback would be offspec gear that you can't use this way - e.g. with different enchants.<br />

The world is changing so much that a lot of quests will need to be rewritten as well.<br />
Some might not be possible anymore, while you might also be seeing several new ones.<br />

Let's hope for blizzard's sake that they made the quests intelligent enough to point to NPC numbers and directions rather than fixed quest texts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With regards to the new tier10 system - I liked the idea of allowing the trophy of crusades dropping of Anub'Arak in 10 man hard mode. Even though it gives the same reward as facerolled 25 man normal tier, it's a great step by the developers. I hope they pursue this in 10 man hard modes in ICC and allow 10.5 to drop there, as presumably like all previous content, 10 man hard modes will be harder than 25 man normal mode.</div></div><hr />

Questions that will generate a little more than &quot;wait and see&quot;?<br />
<br />
Questions like, do you personally think making normal modes so easy for the casual raider has affected the more hardcore community, by which i mean after facerolling the entire instance on normal mode, what true motivation is there to go back and do the same fight over again just for better loot? <br />
<br />
The epicness of first kills has disappeared, granted first kills on hard modes are brilliant, but it's more of a &quot;fuck yeah we finally beat a slightly harder version of the same boss we killed 3 weeks ago! good job folks!&quot; <br />

I mean seriously, half of them have either been answered at Blizzcon panels or use common sense to answer. For example:<br />
<br />
Hyjal (answered at Blizzcon)<br />
Grim Batol (same here)<br />
Leveling from 80-85 similar to 70-80 (Bliiiiizzcon)<br />
Phased world for higher chars and lowbie (Blizzcon guys)<br />
Legendaries upgraded (has been asked a kazillion times before, stop asking warriors!)<br />
Worgen mounts (seriously? I mean...it's plain obvious or did you expect an answer like &quot;no, they won't have any mounts&quot;?)<br />
Wintergrasp zone in Cataclysm (PvP panel at Blizzcon)<br />
Comparing Path of the Titans with a reputation (what the... there two completely different system... it's like asking if raiding will ever work similar to trading at the auction house)<br />
Old reputation worthwhile again (Step 1: use brain; Step 2: come up with a better question)<br />
Alliance + Horde working together (while it would be cool, it makes a massive amount of sense that with Varian and Garrosh in charge this would never ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever happen)<br />
Hunters taming druids (sorry, but this question is just stupid)<br />
Alliance in game band (who cares? even as alliance player I couldn't care less)<br />
Race change regardless of class (yeah... gnome shamans... I hope this wasn't a serious question)<br />
<br />
The only question I actually learned something new from was the question regarding the sanctum underneath wyrmrest temple. No dev ever made a statement regarding that &quot;issue&quot;, now we at least have a possible which kinda implies as &quot;yes, there will be at least one more&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Yes because with the cross realm LFG you can really use a summoning stone to get your other party members to your REALM. Maybe you can only use the LFG system while actually in the instance you want to do, cause that makes sense right? Just sit there and wait for a group instead of doing dailies or something to keep you busy.<br />
<br />
It's a convenience. You know how many people join a group and then go afk, or just wait to be summoned. Or how many join LFG and are in IF with hearth on CD, but want to run a heroic? Yes it's stupid, but this should help some of the idiocy that goes on. As far as I know, if you are going to do a guild run you won't be able to use the instant portal feature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is such a thing as too much convenience. Handing you items directly instead of having to go through the chore of running instances and killing things would count as &quot;convenience&quot; too.<br />
<br />
And why is cross realm grouping even necessary in the first place? I don't think I ever heard anyone ask for this shit or complain that they didn't manage to get a group to do heroics. Seriously.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh noes traveling from IF to northrend is hard QQQQQ I want to do an heroic right this second&quot; -- typical retard playing wow these days.<br />
<br />
I said it in the past and it's proving true with each passing patch: blizzard regards the whole &quot;massive&quot; nature of wow as an inconvenience that should be systematically removed until the game is turned into a fully instanced game like guild wars.<br />
<br />
I'm puzzled as to why they're bothering revamping azeroth in cataclysm; the goddamn place will never be visited ever again by anyone who's level 85.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-10-23, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: Love the steps taken to making high-end content accessible to casual players. How committed are you to continuing this?<br />
<br />
Glad you asked! IAW the community's increasingly vocal minority who love to be spoon fed every encounter, we are going to continue to make the game boring approx. 1 month after every major raid-content patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny because the answer should be something more like this...<br />
<br />
Less than 5% of the population has even bothered to try hard modes while the other 95% has not complained about the time we spent developing hard modes. So, to keep both sides happy the 5% will still get hard modes and the other 95% will be smart enough to figure out the only reason to do hard modes is to gear for hard modes where you get gear that will be replaced in 5 months.<br />
<br />
In short, don't bitch about how the &quot;vocal minority&quot; is ruining the game (which I agree with you by the way whole heartedly) when YOU ARE THE VOCAL MINORITY.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Crowd control is all but dead in raids. Is that something you plan on bringing back?<br />
<br />
Hell no! We let you mages sheep a mob or two in one encounter in ToTC!!! What more do you want! It's all about spamming interrupts and AoEing everything down, mang!<br />
<br />
<br />
How about this answer seeing its more accurate...<br />
<br />
We allowed for a lot of CC in TBC and players ABSOLUTELY hated it. They complained about it each step of the way and they begged for not only less trash but for less need of CC. This was spurred on by the fact that WoW is the only MMO that actually has tried to make an affective CC system. So, we decided that we would go the way of others games (because we are used to copying the best ideas from every game on the market anyways) and go with all AoE in the vast majority of all cases. To shut up the hardcore whiners we gave you a few cases where CC was needed (like with the vast majority of the trash in Uludar). Some day we will finally realize that the hardcore whiners have never stopped whining in five years and never will, but that hasn't actually dawned on us yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, for the sarcasm, but being a slightly-hardcore turned full casual from the ease of blasting through raids, it's not filling me with hope. Frankly, and I hate to say it, but getting fed xxx amount of Emblems and having them change every few months is really getting dull.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-10-23, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why they can't just remove &quot; NO Questing in Raid&quot; penalty?? I didn't understand his words about Howling Fjord.<br />
<br />
<br />
His basic stance is that if you remove the no questing in raid penalty then you open up the door for people to just join the zone raid to do the quests. This would come down to sharing all the quests then individuals doing the quest but the whole raid (for the zone) benefiting. <br />
<br />
Two problems:<br />
<br />
1) He fails to realize the ONLY reason that the raid quest penalty was ever introduced is because guilds used to run 20 members through Deadmines at the same time and they used to all be able to get their quests at the time. That was when the game was new and 20 people actually wanted to destroy Deadmines at the same time.<br />
<br />
2) He fails to realize that his example is one of the best possible things that could ever happen in a MMO. If you have a zone raid going that has people working on quests together then you ENCOURAGE online game play with others outside of raid zones. That is a good thing in an MMO not a bad thing. Not to mention then they could design things like zone bosses where the best quest items in the entire zone come from that particular quest and it takes 25 people to kill them. Of course, that would take redesigning the raid system to cap it at 25 people which in turn would take redesigning AV (and any other BG with more than 25) to cap it at 25 people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes and avoidance stats will still be capped and there will be times when stamina and threat will be enough (most likely the entire first tier of raiding will be more stam/threat based than avoidance based), so once those avoidance caps are met look to see the tanks going after whatever gets them more threat while maintaining a decent health pool (DPS GEAR!).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't really see it as a hybrid system at all. Really, its nothing more than what is currently in the game for TOC other than that you won't need to get the emblems again once you buy the beginning item and the Trophy of the Crusade is now class specific to 3-4 classes (most likely to prevent raid wide roll spam bitching but I still think this is a stupid idea because the Trophy of the Crusade idea was MUCH better than the class token system).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-10-23, 02:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wait... what?<br />
<br />
<br />
If they took all the old world factions to level 85 (which is honestly what people are asking about) and took those items to 85 it would be much easier for a person that got those factions 5-6 years ago to just go buy the rewards than a newer player.<br />
<br />
The current problem is that the old factions seem so incredibly grindy that no one really bothers with them while they are leveling up although there are some VERY nice rewards from them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-10-23, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've honestly got a big feeling that a huge portion of those are going to be taken out. Since they're basically jumping old world into the current spot in the timeline, it means that a lot of the quests will be gone, since their problem is now fixed. Obviously, they won't be able to do this with EVERYTHING, since it would take an insanely massive overhaul to get everything fitting into a perfect continuity.<br />
<br />
<br />
They have already hinted that they will take entire dungeons out. WC is being removed for example. They will most likely either totally redo BRD/LBRS/UBRS or remove them completely. Honestly, they pretty much have to go back and redo every single quest reward anyways while streamlining leveling, so it makes much more sense to completely remove certain quests and certain quest hubs (Southshore) to streamline the process and provide more quests with better rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I could see them taking The Missing Diplomat quest chain out of the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
While I agree this is a very good example, I totally disagree with you on the reason. I think it has nothing at all to do with lore. I think it has much more to do with this being a quest that spans multiple zones. The new quests in Cataclysm will be much more like TBC and WotLK in that you stay in the same zone to complete them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Really, it's impossible to keep the lore perfectly straight for a new player while still having them progress through the game and old content. I guess that's just the nature of MMO's.<br />
<br />
<br />
The true nature of MMOs (and this really isn't trying to be offensive) is that 99% of the players don't give a rip about lore. Few people play MMOs for the lore. They play for the game play. The game play ALWAYS trumps the lore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As in, can you play the race before the expansion comes out? Umm, you haven't played MMOs very long have you? That would be insanely stupid for Blizzard to do as one of the largest selling points of that $39 box is the new races. That being said, we will most likely see the models in the game before Cataclysm is released but only as npcs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, it was just an example. Although, it is generally accepted that the best main tank healer hands down is the paladin (however, I believe druids can main tank heal as well if not better) and almost all raids have at least one paladin healer. Discipline is still frowned upon as an actual healer, but it has gotten much better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Rated BGs have always been a feature of Cataclysm. Therefore, the ETA is when enough people get to level 85 and fill out the queue. As far as arenas, they will be dead after rated BGs are introduced anyways, so who really cares.</div></div><hr />

Do you honestly think that these were all the questions asked? I HIGHLY doubt it. There was most likely a moderator that decided which questions could be asked and which could not.

<br />
<br />
The problem with this is that they HAVE answered this question so MANY times its not funny. GC has come right out and said that he really doesn't give a damn about the hardcore community in WotLK because he realizes they aren't the ones paying the bills and has every intention of designing this game for the people PAYING the bills. You guys just really don't want to hear it although its been answered. You want your good ole' TBC back where if you weren't hardcore you never made it all the way through T5. Well, sorry to break this to you, but that time was in the past, and if that is the time you want then this is no longer the game for you. Around 5000 people actually bothered with TOGC25. Most servers never even tried Alagon. Its quite obvious that the hardmode system (quite like the arena system) is flawed and broken and not interesting to most players, but they use it as an excuse so that they won't have to actually deal with the small population of hardcores that like to whine the most.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The epicness of first kills has disappeared, granted first kills on hard modes are brilliant, but it's more of a &quot;fuck yeah we finally beat a slightly harder version of the same boss we killed 3 weeks ago! good job folks!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
First kills were always epic ONLY FOR YOU. NO one really gives a crap about world firsts anymore. That is true, but the vast majority of players didn't really give a damn about them for the last 5 years. The first time you beat a boss it becomes epic, and you are kidding yourself if you honestly think that no one has ever felt challenged by a boss in WotLK. If that were true than everyone would have done Alagon and farmed out TOGC25 by now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They WANT you to ignore level 85 and start over -- more mileage. <br />
<br />
<br />
Really, I think this will be the most exciting time for people to re-roll, but I honestly believe that the vast majority of players re-roll anyways when there is an new expansion with new races. I don't see that changing even after paid race changes are introduced. If you beat your head on the same wall for 5 years sooner or later you want a new wall or a new head.</div></div><hr />

Dude, seriously, get off you fat ass go outside or read a book. If you think I'm a fan boy you are retarded. I'm about as far from a fan boy as anyone could possibly ever be and I have 5 years of being critical of this company to prove it.

<br />
If you think the vast majority of people don't love the concept of cross realm BGs you are retarded. Its a great idea because yes people on less populated servers do have issues getting heroic groups. People on at odd times also have issues. This should help to alleviate that. <br />
<br />
The problem with people like you is that if Blizzard started out allowing us to teleport to instances (for example) then decided against it you would bitch that we should be allowed. You just don't like change, and every time Blizzard implements change you see it as the end of the world as we know it.</div></div><hr />

You're a short-sighted moron who can't see further than his own nose. Pretty much like whoever at blizzard decided to add this teleporting stuff.<br />
See, some people like to do world pvp. One of the last remaining place to do that was at meeting stones.<br />
<br />
Also if it takes you that much time to go to instances, you could have earned a way to solve it, namely an epic flying mount. You know, earning things through playing the game and not by waiting for the developers to magically remove things because you happen not to like them.<br />

Handing you items directly instead of having to go through the chore of running instances and killing things would count as &quot;convenience&quot; too.<br />
<br />
And why is cross realm grouping even necessary in the first place? I don't think I ever heard anyone ask for this shit or complain that they didn't manage to get a group to do heroics. Seriously.<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh noes traveling from IF to northrend is hard QQQQQ I want to do an heroic right this second&quot; -- typical retard playing wow these days.<br />
<br />
I said it in the past and it's proving true with each passing patch: blizzard regards the whole &quot;massive&quot; nature of wow as an inconvenience that should be systematically removed until the game is turned into a fully instanced game like guild wars.<br />
<br />
I'm puzzled as to why they're bothering revamping azeroth in cataclysm; the goddamn place will never be visited ever again by anyone who's level 85.<br />
<br />
<br />
Congrats on totally failing. There is such a thing as tedious too. If Blizz kept leveling the same as it was when the game started, it would be terrible. Who wants to start brand new to WoW when it takes them 3 months to get to level 80? Or maybe flight paths or flying mounts are too convenient for you too? If you LFG and get people from another realm you cannot summon them to stone, and it's doubtful that a lock will be able to summon them even if it's done inside the instance.<br />
<br />
When you've been waiting for 30 minutes to get a group, you stick with them even if it's full of idiots. You wind up being at the stone for 15 minutes waiting for someone to make their way there. I'm sorry but I'd rather actually &quot;play&quot; the game then sit there waiting for groups and then waiting for people to slowly get to where they need to be.<br />
<br />
The cross realm LFG will (hopefully) be great for people that aren't trying to make groups at peak times or for something other than the daily heroic. Trying to get a group for DM or a reg Nexus run takes a while, and then think about the people on low pop servers at off peak hours.....<br />
<br />
I really can't believe you would try to say this is so bad or &quot;making the game too easy&quot;. You guys need to come up with new excuses for whining. Most of the time I see that it is coming from people that haven't even done the latest raid on normal, let alone the hard modes. Not to mention the countless other things they could be doing in game that they appear to do none of.<br />
<br />
Really your last statement just makes my head hurt. You do realize that in Cata they will be adding new races right? They are changing the period of time in which the game is taking place as well. There will be tons of new goblin/worgen characters who will enjoy the new leveling paths. Also much of the &quot;end game&quot; content will be all around Azeroth. How can you even say it won't be revisited ....</div></div><hr />

This is a very good change. Travel time in games has NEVER been anything more than an inconvenience. I'm also willing to guess that you are bitching about this but you are also one of the first people to beg for a summons.<br />
<br />
<br />
LoL that last part made me think about all the idiots that whine and complain about stuff being too easy and stuff being handed out, and then as soon as they get in a group from LFG/trade chat they ask for a summons and say hearth is on CD. But I have to agree that &quot;travel time&quot; in a game is annoying. I don't mind it to an extent, but when it's over-done, it gets in the way of playing.<br />
<br />
Taking a FP from Teldrassil (sp?) to Un'goro .... seriously, I wish I could have that 15 minutes of my life back EACH TIME! The first time I took the FP from IF to SW, I was amazed at how big the game was and how good it looked. That was cool and enjoyable, and I still like that feeling, but I don't want traveling to take as much time as playing does.<br />
<br />
IMO the instant port is 100% necessary for the cross realm LFG. Outside of that it isn't really needed, though they could actually shorten up some of the travel time/points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instances are separate servers - having them grouped by server rack is actually pretty nice/handy - as has been done with battlegrounds. However the real reason why they introduced this method of getting into the instance arises from the fact that you can't summon people from a different server via the summoning portal... then again it could theoretically be solved by placing the summoning portal into the instance - so you'd still need at least two people already in place to summon the rest - I guess it's just less work implementing it the way they did with cross-realm battlegrounds..</div></div><hr />

See, some people like to do world pvp. One of the last remaining place to do that was at meeting stones.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, your issue is a lack of world PvP? You do know of this zone called WG right? Or, by world &quot;PvP&quot; do you mean being on a &quot;PvP&quot; server camping low level meeting stones with your level 80 rogue/druid?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also if it takes you that much time to go to instances, you could have earned a way to solve it, namely an epic flying mount. You know, earning things through playing the game and not by waiting for the developers to magically remove things because you happen not to like them.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are clueless dude. I have 3 toons that all have epic flying. Getting epic flying is NOT NOT NOT hard. Getting gold is not hard. Thanks for being short sighted and not seeing past your nose and seeing that I'm not complaining about not having an epic mount. On an epic mount (or on a flight path) it takes more than 10 minutes to get from Nexus to UK. In a good group you can clear half the instance in 10 minutes on heroic. That is a problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What's next? &quot;We realize that anyone can kill trash mobs and that taking so much time just to kill them is a waste of time so now all players have an ability to instantly kill any dungeon trash mobs&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a STRETCH of unimaginable proportions. The two have NOTHING to do with each other. Doing the dungeon has nothing to do with getting to the dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard is actually listening to players way too much these days, and they shouldn't because players are abysmally stupid. &quot;Hey I want all epix for free and never have to travel and never have to die and never be ganked and a pony&quot; &quot;granted&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Very few players have EVER asked for free epics. Very few players actually want epics. Blizzard is listening to the people that pay their bills and buy their product? Imagine that! Countries in this this world have existed for at least 300+ years (in the vast majority of all regions) by listening to the feed back of their citizens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I'm saying is that adding convenience to the game is not a no-brainer, there are downside to it most of the time and if you don't take the time to analyse it you're going to majorly fuck up interesting parts of the game just so some people can save 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
You somehow turned what I say into me defending everything and anything tedious. I never talked about the time it takes to level up, for instance, which I have no problem with.<br />
<br />
Your problem is that you're talking from the point of view of someone for whom the game is nothing but heroic run after heroic run. I'm talking form the point of view of someone who enjoys other parts of the game such as world pvp, and some of those changes (like the teleporting crap) brings you marginal time saving at the cost of completely fucking up world pvp.<br />
<br />
Stop being so self-centered and assuming that the way you play the game is the way everybody plays it.<br />
<br />
And anyway, what the deal with getting to a fucking instance? You need just two people who can get there in a couple minutes and then they can summon you.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you've been waiting for 30 minutes to get a group, you stick with them even if it's full of idiots. You wind up being at the stone for 15 minutes waiting for someone to make their way there. I'm sorry but I'd rather actually &quot;play&quot; the game then sit there waiting for groups and then waiting for people to slowly get to where they need to be.<br />
<br />
The new lfg system won't solve any of that anyway because of the cooldown you'll receive when using it, and because you'll wait it out and try again instead of reverting to the old way. You know why? Because you'll get more gold and emblems that way.<br />
<br />
And anyway, if you're grouped with asshats who are afk, getting to the instance faster won't change a thing, you'll still have to wait for them.<br />
Essentially you expect changes in the game mechanics to solve the idiocy of other players and it's not possible. You have to accept that if you play a game where you need to play with other people you're going to play with morons a lot of the time and there's nothing that will ever solve this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Trying to get a group for DM or a reg Nexus run takes a while, and then think about the people on low pop servers at off peak hours.....<br />
<br />
It's their bloody fault for staying on a low pop server, isn't it? But it's just like people who complain about getting ganked on pvp servers. They shouldn't be forced to deal with the consequences of their own choices, oh no, can't have that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really your last statement just makes my head hurt. <br />
<br />
That's because you're trying to use it for the first time, probably.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also much of the &quot;end game&quot; content will be all around Azeroth. How can you even say it won't be revisited ....<br />
<br />
End game content for most pople = idling in a capital city in between two instances. Azeroth is that thing in between the two that you won't need to go through anymore since you're going to teleport directly into the instance. So the azeroth revamp will end up like northrend, content used once while people level up and then forgotten. Such a waste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Please, for the love of god tell me how being on a flight path for 10 minutes is an &quot;interesting part&quot; of the game. If your whine is about the lack of world PvP then bitch at Blizzard about that. Yes, it sometimes happens at meeting stones, but the vast majority of people that use meeting stones do it because they want to do the dungeon not because they want to PvP, so its a SIDE EFFECT of the summoning stone system not a part of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Your problem is you are short sighted all you can do is make assumptions. I never ONCE said I don't like world PvP. I love WG actually. However, when I'm doing instances I want to be doing instances. When I'm PvPing I want to be PvPing. At no point do I want to be stuck on a flight path for 10 minutes to get from one dungeon to another. That is time I could be spending doing anything else in game.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And anyway, what the deal with getting to a fucking instance? You need just two people who can get there in a couple minutes and then they can summon you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most people take about 10-15 minutes to get there then god forbid someone went afk while waiting. It shouldn't take longer to get to the dungeon than it takes to do the dungeon. This is simply a good change.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The new lfg system won't solve any of that anyway because of the cooldown you'll receive when using it, and because you'll wait it out and try again instead of reverting to the old way. You know why? Because you'll get more gold and emblems that way.<br />
<br />
<br />
Where did this cool down come from? Is this something that you have tested on the test realm yourself (I highly doubt it)? I've seen no information that says there will be a cool down at all. I think you are just assuming there will be one. I see the reason for a possible cool down (to keep players from just jumping from spot to spot not to instance but to get places faster, but I still think its a bad idea).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's their bloody fault for staying on a low pop server, isn't it? But it's just like people who complain about getting ganked on pvp servers. They shouldn't be forced to deal with the consequences of their own choices, oh no, can't have that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, because you knew the population of your server when you started playing, eh? That is absolute crap. Its a cop out. Its like saying, this affects you not me so screw you its all about me. That is such a moronic way to view things. If you want to pay their $25 transfer you can tell them which server to play on. Until then, stfu about it.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Could you really be more clueless? Yes, all those daily quests that you can't port to and aren't in dungeons simply don't exist right? You do know there will be a crap load of daily quests in Azeroth don't you? All those grinding spots that you normally go to will just not be there? All the gathering nodes just won't be worth it? <br />

WG is not world pvp, it's a non-instanced battleground and the difference with an instanced BG is marginal. By world pvp I mean playing cat and mouse with other players, it's not as one sided as you make it out to be when you have people on both side who enjoy it.<br />
<br />
If you never gotten how world pvp can be enjoyable that's fine, but you are in no position to offer any judgement about it.<br />

You're grasping at straws. This would only happen if:<br />
1. you do nexus<br />
2. you decide to do UK right after<br />
3. with the same group (otherwise someone would be at the meeting stone before you could do the entire flight)<br />
<br />
If this actually happen regularly to you then it's pretty much your own problem because I can't see any reason why you'd HAVE to consecutively run the two instances that are the furthest apart in northrend on a regular basis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World PvP SHOULD be a choice. If people CHOSE not to do it then deal with it. Blizzard never rewarded or removed rewards from the good old SS/TM days of world pvp. People simply chose not to do them. I thought you said that you can never change the game to make up for the actions the players take? Now, you want Blizzard to do just that? Unless by world PvP you mean nothing more than ganking lowbies at summoning stones and that is NOT world PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you never gotten how world pvp can be enjoyable that's fine, but you are in no position to offer any judgement about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, I've played this game for 5 years. I've done old school TM/SS battles many times. Those battles stopped happening because players stopped wanting to be in them not because of anything Blizzard did. I have every right to comment on things I've been a part of for the last 5 years. So, don't tell me what my position (according to you) is.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I never found running instances any fun, yet I don't go around telling you that your favorite part of wow is somehow not something you have a legitimate right to enjoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
When did I EVER say my favorite part of WoW was doing instances? I never once said that. Its another assumption (god are you tired of making an ass out of both of us yet) that you came up with. My favorite part of WoW is BG PvP for your information and I even enjoy world PvP (even outside of WG). I said multiple times what I don't like is flying for 10 minutes not being able to do anything but go afk. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You're grasping at straws. This would only happen if:<br />
1. you do nexus<br />
2. you decide to do UK right after<br />
3. with the same group (otherwise someone would be at the meeting stone before you could do the entire flight)<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not grasping at straws at all. UK and Nexus are the two easiest heroics in the game. Its very common to stay with the same group if the group is going well. Its VERY common to need to go from Nexus to UK when you are doing a heroic group and just starting out for the day.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If this actually happen regularly to you then it's pretty much your own problem because I can't see any reason why you'd HAVE to consecutively run the two instances that are the furthest apart in northrend on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
As, I said, they are not only the easiest they are the only ones people ever really do on a daily basis (as in not the freaking daily). Most people skip the other heroics because UK and Nexus are the two easiest heroics to do in the entire game.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
At most they'll do those at one daily quest hub. Except that if it takes less time to get an instance run going than to go there they won't even bother at all.<br />

You are right. I think doing nothing in the game for 10 minutes is pretty freaking pathetic. I started out playing UO where travel was instant and it was much more enjoyable because you didn't have to spend up ward to one hour per 10 hour gaming session doing nothing more than flying places.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Awesome! There will be ten bots and two masochists farming resources, world pvp is saved!<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought, by your definition of &quot;world pvp&quot; (which as far as I can tell is nothing more than ganking people 20 or so levels below you at meeting stones) that you would love to farm bots because they give you almost the same &quot;challenge&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You are assuming the majority of players actually give a damn what someone's gear looks like in heroics. I simply do not agree with you for the vast majority of heroics. If someone is doing 1200 dps they care and normally kick that person, but its been shown time and time again that people in full T9+ gear have done 1200 dps in heroics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World PVP is all over the place. There is always (daily) quest hubs and places to find people. You also seem to be skipping the fact there will still be plenty of people entering instances and using stones the old way. Yes it's possible this new LFG system could cut down on some of the people sitting at stones. I am not saying all I do is run after run, nor did I say I don't enjoy pvp/world pvp. You are the one whining about it totally removing the need for summoning stones or people EVER AGAIN using one, which is totally not true.<br />
<br />
Being on a low pop server or only being able to play at off peak times, or maybe even just playing at random times because of your real life schedule is very common. No one wants to pay to play a game where when they sign on they have to wait an hour to get a group to do a run. I'm sure the cross realm LFG can help get you into groups faster.<br />
<br />
The problem with people who afk etc is they get an invite and then afk and wait for summons etc. The new system appears to have a ready check, so if you click ready you are obviously there and &quot;should&quot; be ready. I believe there will also be ways to remove people from these groups if they decide that getting in a group and then going afk or are otherwise not being productive. This is likely only a good feature. You assume that EVERYONE likes to world pvp at summoning stones and kill people that are afk. You're the one assuming others only play your way, not me.<br />
<br />
I don't see what you want out of world pvp. Basically what people like you usually want is actually &quot;ganking&quot;. You get 20 friends and go kill the 10 people (of which half are usually afk) at a stone. You aren't looking for a good fight or a challenge. If you want that, you'll like WG and Halaa or Isle of Quel'danas type areas. If the new daily hub gives more gold per quest or a good reason to go there, it will make for plenty of pvp. I would like to see more places like that around as well. But killing afk people in pve gear is just lame and no challenge, yet seems to be exactly what you want.<br />
<br />
Too bad if it takes away some of that because I guarantee you that more people would rather get into instances faster than are worried about the very small impact it will have on world pvp.<br />
<br />
I don't know how else to address your stupidity, but Azeroth is being revamped, like it or not. We'll get flying (which almost everyone in the game wants), new instances, new quest lines, updated zones etc etc. Yes it will be &quot;the same content&quot; in a way but it's going to be very new as well. You can find your new places to do &quot;world pvp&quot; while other people do their new raids in the Wetlands, or Heroic DM. It's not all about YOU.</div></div><hr />

I agree. People play on pvp servers by their own choice, don't they?<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless by world PvP you mean nothing more than ganking lowbies at summoning stones and that is NOT world PvP.<br />
<br />
By world pvp I mean fighting off people at maximum level alone or in small groups as they go about their business. This where most good world pvp emerges from. If people go about their business almost only in instances or capital cities where they can disable pvp, then there is no opportunity to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, don't tell me what my position (according to you) is.<br />
<br />
I'll stop doing this when you do, such as implying that what I want to do is gank lowbies or such crap.<br />
<br />
<br />
When did I EVER say my favorite part of WoW was doing instances? I never once said that.<br />
<br />
It's irrelevant to what my argument was.<br />
<br />
<br />
My favorite part of WoW is BG PvP for your information and I even enjoy world PvP (even outside of WG). I said multiple times what I don't like is flying for 10 minutes not being able to do anything but go afk.<br />
<br />
You can't have your cake and eat it too. You can't have everything going your way. You can't both want to have any world pvp yet don't want to have to travel into the world.<br />
It's like pvp servers: you can't want to e able to kill people at anytime you want to kill them and at the same time want to be able to not be killed if you don't feel like it.<br />
<br />
I mean, I'd even be happier if there was no flying mounts, at last in some places. Yes, it would be a small inconvenience for me but I know that it's a sacrifice I have to do for world pvp to be able to happen.<br />
<br />
You know why I assumed you don't like world pvp? Because it seems that for you anything can and should be sacrificed to reduced any downtime, and that's just completely incompatible with the existence of any opportunity for world pvp. You're not coherent in your reasoning.<br />
<br />
You can say that world pvp should only happen between people who are at that particular moment willing to do world pvp, but it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
1. you can't easily hook up with people from the other faction and tell them &quot;hey, wanna go do some world pvp?&quot; <br />
<br />
2. the whole point of world pvp is that you should use any trick (ie &quot;play to win&quot;) you can to win and kill the other guy(s). Deliberately putting yourself in a position to be attacked in the first place is contradictory with this. If you give people control over whether they can be killed they will chose not too if it advantage them and you end up with situations where people wait on flying mounts and won't fight until their friends show up and they outnumber you 5 to 1.<br />
<br />
From a strict &quot;playing to win&quot; point of view it makes sense to do that but it's also not very interesting as the outcome of the battle is determined purely by how you set it up and not by how you actually play.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not grasping at straws at all. UK and Nexus are the two easiest heroics in the game. Its very common to stay with the same group if the group is going well. Its VERY common to need to go from Nexus to UK when you are doing a heroic group and just starting out for the day.<br />
<br />
Alright, so then maybe it can be chalked up to a design flaw of wotlk, but there's no reason why it will have to be set up that way in cataclysm so the teleporting group stuff might not end up being that needed then. Yet it will still exist with all its downsides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Glad you asked! IAW the community's increasingly vocal minority who love to be spoon fed every encounter, we are going to continue to make the game boring approx. 1 month after every major raid-content patch.<br />
<br />
Q: Crowd control is all but dead in raids. Is that something you plan on bringing back?<br />
<br />
Hell no! We let you mages sheep a mob or two in one encounter in ToTC!!! What more do you want! It's all about spamming interrupts and AoEing everything down, mang!<br />
<br />
Sorry, for the sarcasm, but being a slightly-hardcore turned full casual from the ease of blasting through raids, it's not filling me with hope. Frankly, and I hate to say it, but getting fed xxx amount of Emblems and having them change every few months is really getting dull.<br />

<br />
<br />
That's exactly one of the points I was making, but according to Zlodo we should all choose to reroll or pay hundreds of dollars to transfer all our toons to high pop servers where we can wait in queue to login. Or maybe people should quit their jobs or not hang out outside of wow so they can be on at peak times when all the groups are being formed.<br />
<br />
No no no, anyone not looking for level 80 heroics or on a high pop server (I guess like him cause all he cares about is the way he plays) should not have a say ....<br />
<br />
<br />
I started out playing UO where travel was instant and it was much more enjoyable<br />
I really wish travel was more like UO at times. It was easily exploitable and lead to a lot of farming issues, but I think there could be limitations implemented to prevent that. If they just made the current system a tad better I could live without it though.<br />
<br />
Mostly my complaint isn't about travel time, the original complaint before Zlodo started throwing it off track was about idiots. The kind who get into a group and go afk, or won't travel to a stone and help summon etc. When you get a whole group of these people it's annoying. The LFG won't help with idiots, but it can at least get past a small part of the annoyance of waiting on people forever. At least till you get inside :(</div></div><hr />

Now not only will we get a more intuitive interface that makes sense, we'll also be able to do instances most don't want to do, such a HoL or HoS, because across your entire Battlegroup there will be tanks and healers and DPS who want to do those.<br />

<br />
As far as I know the instant port is not able to be used all the time, so the amount of people idling at stones for you to gank may not even be affected that much. There will always be people using the stones, but it's still dumb. You can't claim you want good fights and then say you like to gank afk people in pve gear (yes my words but effectively what you are doing).<br />
<br />
If this is actually what you want from world pvp, then complain to Blizz that there should be more areas that focus on that. Even if everyone could now instantly port into instances there are still other areas to go. This would be another stupid reason that pve (entire realms) would suffer because of pvp. No, stop thinking about yourself, Blizz is looking at the big picture here, not you.<br />
<br />
WG had some really good and bad things about it. Hopefully they fix it in Cata. Making a (or multiple) quest hubs/zones in pvp areas is a good idea IMO. There can be areas like the tournament grounds for people that want to go there instead. That's where you'll get good fights and even big groups of people.</div></div><hr />

Yea, they'd like tension between the sides to rise... unless you make one easy payment of $25.00 to faction change, in which case you CAN become one &quot;big happy family&quot;.<br />

<br />
If they wanted to have tensions, they could've easily split up Shattrath and Dala into Horde/Ally districts without us having to face each other, and if someone would manage to get to the other district he should/could still be attacked and killed. <br />
<br />
For example, giving sewers to horde (albeit bigger/better) and giving the top world to the allies.</div></div><hr />

You nerfed that, thats cool. But why shouldn't a healing class have a spell that's more desirable in most situations than another? 3/5 useful heals we have are hots. Making them all equal is pointless and redundant, so one should be a bit better. Swiftmend has a CD. Nourish is situational. Sure, blanketing the raid with rejuvs in a heavy raid damage fight might be a bit overpowered, specially with more than one druid, but whats the point of healing? Keeping the raid alive.

Cataclysm<br />
Q: With T10, are we going to see tokens like in Ulduar? or like CC? CC style had every class and spec rolling on same thing.<br />
A: With t10 we're going to see a hybrid. The tier 10 items (the ones with item levels you'd find in the 10-player raid) will be purchased with Emblems of Frost.<br />
<br />
The tier 10.5 items (the ones with item levels you'd find in the 25-player raid) will be obtained by getting a token (one that is specific to 3 or 4 classes, much like the ulduar tokens) and using it to upgrade the tier 10 item that was purchased with emblems of frost. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2009-10-24, 01:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've honestly got a big feeling that a huge portion of those are going to be taken out. Since they're basically jumping old world into the current spot in the timeline, it means that a lot of the quests will be gone, since their problem is now fixed. Obviously, they won't be able to do this with EVERYTHING, since it would take an insanely massive overhaul to get everything fitting into a perfect continuity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yup. Not only should they be bringing some older quests up to date to the current timeline, but they've also got to consider whether some quests will even be POSSIBLE to complete anymore. Vanilla-WoW at higher levels (55-60 or so) tended to have quests sending you just about everywhere. Quests in Winterspring for UBRS, quests in Tanaris for Scholo, and so forth. Some of these will NEED to be either re-written or removed. Then there's the zones which are having massive changes made to them, while some quests may survive, others are just going to end up being removed.<br />
<br />
Just to give an example of one HUGE quest line they're more than likely to either remove or make some SERIOUS changes to, take a look at AQ40 quest chain. It's pretty much the longest, most complicated quest chain in WoW, and sends you almost everywhere. But the gates on all the servers are now open, so they can safely remove it if they need to. <br />
<br />
As for the &quot;no group quests in raids&quot; thing, while it's true that it'd be cool to have zone-wide raids, you know how it would look on day 1. Mass zerg across the continent, half of the leveling content done in 2 hours or so. Meanwhile, anyone that gets there a few days later is going to be looking at a seriously slow grind. The only way to avoid this is the &quot;low drop rate&quot; quests, which i'm sure everyone loves.<br />
<br />
[edit]<br />
<br />
Ohh something that just occured to me about what they said about the ICC hardmodes;<br />
<br />
So, they maybe using a gate system like ToC and SWP. So, perhaps we'll be waiting for a few weeks before we can try to kill Arthas on normal. <br />
Not only that, but no-one will be able to attempt hard modes until the FOLLOWING week, as there is no running <br />
out and changing difficulty settings this time - you're saved to an empty instance even if you switch to hard mode at the end.<br />
<br />
So that's bought Blizzard at least 1 month of development time before ANYONE is going to defeat Arthas on hard mode. That's the new year in other words. I wonder how long the loot from hard-mode Arthas will last before it's replaced by crafted blues? (or, will we still be using it all the way through the new expansion?)</div></div><hr />
