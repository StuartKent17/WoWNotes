Bad news, I forgot to add two new WotLK screenshots to the news last week. Good news, I thought it would be a good idea to create a few WotLK pages on the site. Most of these screenshots/artworks/wallpapers are from the official site, the Blizzcon, and the Games Convention so don't expect tons of new things but you probably didn't see all of them.

Illidan China first kill<br />
It's a bit late for first kill news, but this one is impressive. Burning Crusade was released in China on September 6th and yesterday a chinese guild called &quot;The Seven&quot; killed Illidan for the first time, that's about 7 weeks to clear Serpentshrine Cavern + Tempest Keep + Black Temple, not counting minor instances like Karazhan, Gruul's Lair and Magtheridon's Lair. That's probably the first killshot of Illidan with so many people still wearing their Tier 3 gear. <br />

There is a deep power deep within you Boubouille. This power confuses me.</div></div><hr />

7 weeks from released to Illidan down<br />
1 week for leveling to 70<br />
1 week for karazhan gruul and mag<br />
3~4 weeks for ssc, tke and hyjal<br />
and 1 weeks for BT and Illidan<br />
each of them got 4 gears from 25 man raid on average<br />
that's all<br />

oh, and their draenei don't have T3 gear.... impressive</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fulnir</div><div class="date">2007-10-29, 08:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, very well done. But they have some nice favors their way:<br />
<br />
- Farmed Naxx until now (All have T3 or best gear available pre-TBC)<br />
- Read guides and followed progress from the side.<br />
- Read how TBC raiding works, what to aim for, what to skip, etc.<br />
- Not having to beat Gruul + Karazhan + Heroic Slave Pens to get into SSC.<br />
- Not having to beat heroic SH, heroic Arcatraz, heroic SL, heroic Coilfang dungeon to get into the eye.<br />
- No downtime between Kael and Hyjal/BT.<br />
- Bossmods + Strat available for every encounter.<br />
- All encounters are tested and bug free (to some extent - at least doable).<br />
<br />
All this combined makes things go faster. I'm not trying to undermine their achievement, but I think Europe have some guilds who could do this as well with the above advantages at hand.<br />
<br />
But still great effort. Hell of lot better than me and the rest of my guild ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skulli</div><div class="date">2007-10-29, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They most likely had tbc-raiding xp too. Not impossible for them to play on eu/us servers.<br />
<br />
Also this shows that KT and some other encounters are not that hard as people think they are.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ndrew</div><div class="date">2007-10-29, 11:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the time frame for their kill is impressive, they didn't have to deal with half the crap that top US/EU guilds had to deal with.<br />
<br />
Heck, the SSC/TK attunements could set back guild progression for weeks. Plus, I believe it was a bugged Vashj and near impossible Kael'thas that kept the top guilds out of Hyjal...oh and the fact that Vashj only dropped 5 vials the first time she was killed.</div></div><hr />

this.<br />
<br />
Also, they couldve already killed illidan on EU/US servers tho. Great job, but nothing better than the top EU/US guilds wouldve done.</div></div><hr />

I bet most of them wouldn't be prepared for 300+ resist, and that makes me feel them awesome</div></div><hr />
