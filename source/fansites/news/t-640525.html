Ulduar Hard Modes<br />
Ignis the Furnace Master, Razorscale, Kologarn, and Auriaya do not have hard modes. Algalon does not have a normal mode.<br />
<br />
That puts the final number of bosses with hard modes at 10. <br />
<br />
<br />
Change to Flasks in 3.1.0<br />
As many of you have learned, we will be reducing the duration of flask effects so that they only last one hour. However, all recipes that create flasks will create two instead of one for the same material cost. Additionally, we will be increasing stack size from 5 to 20 as we anticipate players will need to carry more flasks at a given time. Vendor value for flasks has also been reduced to keep the auction house deposit low.<br />
<br />
Our goal with the change was to allow players greater flexibility when determining how long they plan to raid, as currently we were seeing many players balance time spent raiding around flask duration. We also anticipate that this change will make using flasks in dungeons and battlegrounds a more reasonable decision for players. Though this change will not occur until patch 3.1.0, we wanted to give as much advance notice as possible in case some of you who are stockpiling flasks would prefer to wait to do so until the change is implemented.<br />
<br />
We realize players who currently have stockpiled a lot of flasks may feel like they will lose money with this change, since their current flasks will only last for half as long once 3.1.0 goes live. To partially remedy this, we are going to allow players to exchange any current Northrend flasks (Flask of the Frost Wyrm, Flask of Stoneblood, Flask of Endless Rage and Flask of Pure Mojo) for two flasks with the shorter duration. Flasks from older content will not be grandfathered in, and going forward, it will only be possible to make the flasks with a one hour duration. <br />

<br />
State of PvP and new Battleground<br />
Arenas became the focal point of PvP because there exists in the rating system an easier way to measure skill. On the contrary, battlegrounds shifted from the focus and the means by which the most competitive PvP rewards could be obtained because there's almost no measurement of skill. Someone could AFK their way to great gear just as easily as someone legitimately playing to win every match.<br />
<br />
We don't like this though, as arenas really are meant to be an E-sport side game, not the end all, be all of World of Warcraft PvP. We understand it's a niche game that's not for everyone. What we want to do is revamp the battleground system and create some better functionality to measure skill so that players have access to more comparable rewards to those issued via the arenas. We'd also like to provide the means for player to level up via PvP should that be their preference.<br />
<br />
We have a new battleground on the way for Wrath of the Lich King as well. It's looking pretty cool so far.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
Scarab Lord and AQ40 Legendary Mount<br />
These are two separate issues. The Black Qiraji Battle Tank was attainable by only one person and they needed the backing of an entire guild to get it done. We like the idea of keeping some things rare and hard to obtain, so if an entire group works for it and the entire group gets the reward, it works out a lot better. We want there to be varying levels of rarity for certain items. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/15864788755-scarab-lord.html))<br />
<br />
PvE and PvP Itemization<br />
<br />
We recognize some players like BGs but not Arenas. We recognize some like 5-player dungeons but not raids. That's cool. We just don't yet offer the best epic items except in Arenas and raids.<br />
<br />
We think it was too easy to get the best PvE weapons in LK, at least relative to the difficulty of getting PvP weapons. In BC it was probably the other way around, at least for the earlier seasons. The goal was not that everyone rocks their KT weapons in Arena. Part of this was the relative ease of Naxx, and part of it was not making the PvP gear available early enough.<br />
<br />
We're still evaluating the best way to offer starter PvP gear. The intro gear we had this time around was a little hard to get and didn't offer enough survivability, so coupled with the ease of Naxx epics, the blue(ish) PvP gear just were not very attractive. If players had all walked into Arenas with say 300 resilience or its equivalent and then worked their way up higher, I think the burst damage problem would have been much less of an issue (particularly if there weren't so many potent PvE weapons around at the same time). Logistically, that could mean that it's easy to get resilience up to 300, or we just change the way the ratings work so that 0 resilience provides as much crit protection as 300 or so does currently.<br />
<br />
&quot;Burst damage&quot; is a difficult thing to qualify. As I have said, we absolutely feel like there needs to be a way to kill people in the absence of 30-min long mana-drain or chain-CC fights. However, that doesn't mean that every fight should last 10 seconds because one team blows up someone on the other team immediately. Toning down burst does not mean no burst. There can be something in between immortal healers and glass healers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864748835-petition-bring-back-chess-burst-damage.html))<br />
<br />
Healing Mechanics<br />
When mana isn't particularly limited in an encounter, then the main way we have to challenge your group is by making you global cooldown limited on an encounter. Basically if you ever fail to cast a spell every cooldown, your target may die because incoming damage is so huge.<br />
<br />
While that might feel very challenging, it also works against some of how we want encounters to play. You can't worry about things like mana, movement, healer coordination or overhealing when missing even a single GCD results in a wipe. This does not mean we want healing to be slow and boring. We do want players to make interesting decisions when they are playing, and we fear spamming your most powerful heal every GCD and never stopping isn't really a decision. In fact it feels more like a macro. :) So we make the risk of that behavior to be that you run out of mana.<br />
<br />
(I'm describing a pretty extreme case too, like trying a new boss for the first time when you might be a little undergeared.)<br />
<br />
Another way we could have approached the problem would have been to greatly increase the health of every player and then also increased the damage done by the boss. That way you wouldn't be healing a tank for 25 or even 50% on every big heal. When someone got knocked down low, you would have to cast a few heals to get them up again and the focus would be more on who to heal rather than making sure you don't ever miss a heal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15864859801-from-a-healer-of-4-years.html))<br />

Arena Tournament Phase 3 Begins<br />
Registration for the 2009 World of Warcraft Arena Tournament is now closed and Phase 3 of the tournament has begun. Participants have been battling it out on the tournament realms for the past two weeks while fine-tuning their team composition and strategies. Phase 3 of the tournament includes a lockdown of the teams that will be jockeying for position to compete in the regional finals. Please remember that participants must remain on their team for the duration of the tournament to ensure prize eligibility, and only games played in the 3v3 bracket count towards this goal.<br />
<br />
To track the progress of your team and the competition as a whole, please visit the World of Warcraft Armory at http://www.wowarmory.com/arena-ladder.xml?b=Coliseum%201&amp;ts=3 (http://www.wowarmory.com/arena-ladder.xml?b=Coliseum%201&amp;ts=3) .

Good luck to all competitors!<br />
<br />
Arena Tournament - Team Lockdown<br />
With the new phase, arena team rosters are now locked, meaning that players can no longer be invited to existing arena teams. However, new arena teams can still be created with the restriction that players cannot be added to the team past the ones that sign the arena charter.

Anti-Magic Shell changes in latest build<br />
Its just a cap on the mitigation. If an attack did 100% of your health, you would take 50% of your health in damage. Instead of 25% without magic surpression and 0% with it. The bubble would be gone afterward too.<br />
<br />
I'm not exactly sure if this really &quot;solves&quot; anything though. Its still guaranteed survival against anything a tank is actually supposed to get hit by. It just stops you from say, eating frost breath from Saph or the 1,000,000 damage rocket strikes from Mimiron with magic suppression. Well, actually I suppose it does make it significantly less effective against plasms blast, so it does make the skill weaker against some of the things tanks actually get hit by. <br />
This is fairly accurate, and yes Mimiron (and similar situations) was the problem here, not QQ from other classes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15864749441-ams-nerf--ambiguous-wording.html))<br />

Winter's Chill and Improved Scorch changes<br />
I think we are likely to make the following changes:<br />
Improved Scorch: In addition to the stacking crit debuff, will improve your critical strike chance with Fireball, Scorch or Frostfire Bolt by 1/2/3%.<br />
Winter's Chill: In addition to the stacking crit debuff, will improve your critical strike chance with Frostbolt (possibly all Frost) by 1/2/3%.<br />
Standard &quot;no promises&quot; caveat applies. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864259529-can-winters-chill-get-the-scorch-treatment.html))<br />

Judgement of the Wise in 3.1<br />
We looked at a lot of Ret parses and picked a Judgements of the Wise number that would make up for the loss of Spiritual Attunement mana. If you don't have mana problems on Live, you shouldn't have them in 3.1. However if you do, you can get the Blood glyph. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864259508-mandatory-glyph-to-fix-a-broken-mechanic.html))<br />
<br />
Crusader's Strike<br />
One correction:<br />
Crusader Strike is now An instant strike that causes 110% weapon damage. In addition, if you strike a player while they are casting, their magical damage and healing will be reduced by 50% for 6 sec.<br />
<br />
That is not an official change. It is something we were experimenting with, but not a change we are going to make for 3.1.<br />
<br />
The short story is that while we want to make Crusader Strike a more exciting ability, we don't think that this is the way to go about it. The &quot;Overpower debuff&quot; won't really give them anything more interesting in PvE. In PvP it isn't as game-changing for a warrior who already had access to an interrupt and the Mortal Strike debuff. Giving both of those to a paladin could be very game-changing and not the kind of thing we are ready to do without a lot more testing.<br />
<br />
Sorry for any confusion. Sometimes in our haste to update the PTR as often as we can, you get a chance to see behind the curtain a little more than we intend. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864309119-new-ptr-build-paladin-changes.html))<br />

Psychic Horror cooldown<br />
We were worried about the short cooldown in combination with Psychic Horror not sharing the Psychic Scream diminishing returns. We imagined every fight starting with the priest just chain CC-ing someone. It was intended as a defensive tool, to use when you're having trouble with a melee class or hunter. The longer duration should make you think about when you use it instead of just firing it off as part of your rotation.<br />
<br />
Having said that, cooldowns are a relatively easy thing to mess with, so we can always tune it up or down depending on how it plays out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864309293-phorror-nerf-deserves-an-explanation.html))<br />

Totem of Wrath<br />
Totem of Wrath has always been 30 yards. We just fixed a bug in the tooltip. [...] We'll just change the range of both to 40 yards and be done with it. This was just supposed to be a tooltip cleanup, not a nerf to the class in any way. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864789409-totem-of-wrath-nerf.html))<br />
<br />
Totem-stomping macros<br />
From our POV, there is no defense of totem-stomping macros. If you want to take the time to give your pet a command and a target to kill a totem, great. But to be able to neutralize a core mechanic of the class so easily because you are clever enough to copy a macro off of the Internet is not skill.<br />
<br />
The only reason they still exist are technical limitations, not because we like the design. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864259148-in-defense-of-totem-stomping-macros.html))<br />

<br />
Intimidating Shout<br />
We didn't make a change to Intimidating Shout's effects. We just fixed a bug where the tooltip was showing the wrong number. It was confusing range with area or something like that. But to be clear, if you don't read the tooltip, the ability should work exactly like it does now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15864859721-intimidating-shout-nerf-why.html))<br />
<br />
Berserker Stance bonus changed from AP to Strength<br />
1) We want warriors to wear plate. We balance around warriors wearing plate.<br />
2) Because of the way certain warrior mechanics work, leather is attractive.<br />
3) One of these mechanics is AP being overvalued compared to Strength.<br />
4) This change was to try to shift more value back to Strength.<br />
5) Warriors are balanced around wearing plate. When warriors wear leather and do too much damage, then they end up getting nerfed. But really this is a symptom of #3, not anything players are doing wrong.<br />
6) If you wear plate and don't do enough damage, we'll buff you.<br />
7) We realize this change lets Arms off the hook... for the moment.<br />
8 ) We like both the logic and gameplay of classes being able to wear armor besides &quot;theirs.&quot; It's nice if a paladin uses healing cloth that is an upgrade for them and might otherwise be sharded. It's nice if a warrior can use a rogue item if they have nothing better. But honestly, sometimes we are pretty close to just restricting classes to &quot;their&quot; armor and not &quot;their&quot; armor plus all &quot;lesser&quot; armors.<br />
9) I know you might drool over stats on another character. But that's not the way we balance. If we gave you plate with Spirit and Stamina on it, we would change warrior mechanics to make those numbers useful. You may say &quot;If I wear the gear I am supposed to wear, I'll be terrible.&quot; We say &quot;If you wear the gear your'e supposed to wear, you'll be balanced.&quot; We made a similar change to Feral druids lately, because they stacked AP at the expense of everything else. It was too good a stat and led them to make choices based solely on what gear maximized their AP. Sound familiar?<br />
10) If you think your damage is low, bring that up in these forums. But say &quot;Our damage is low.&quot; Don't say &quot;We need leather.&quot; <br />
<br />
[...] There is a good chance we may change the Improved Berserker Stance effect from 15% Strength to 20% Strength to make up for all the AP that gets thrown around in buffs, enchants and consumables. There are also more rings etc. in Ulduar with Strength, and more leather with Agi instead of AP.<br />
<br />
Adding 2 more ranks to Armored to the Teeth is also possible, but that would probably be too big a change for 3.1. We want plate to be the best in slot for warriors, not leather. <br />
<br />
Why is there a narrower distribution of stats on plate? We're drawn to leather because the stats have a better spread. Why can't this approach be adopted for plate? What's the concern? <br />
The root issue is that on the leather we tend to add Agi or AP as that additional stat. The problem is that armor with both Strength and AP is a little silly, and plate with Agi isn't that useful for warriors. So we don't actually have another stat to split.<br />
<br />
The alternative is to shift some of the Stamina into Strength. That is just a straight buff to warriors though, and we might have to rebalance all of the damage abilities to make up for it. Long-term this is something we might do. Short-term it might push warriors farther away from being balanced. That might be a fun thought if you are of the mindset that Fury dps is low, but it's not going to do anyone any favors if it ended up overshooting the target by a great amount.

<br />
Most of Sunwell's plate gear was perfect for the plate wearer.<br />
That is by design. I suspect the Icecrown gear will look a lot sexier too, because it will be the final round of gear and we can afford to go nuts on it. If your T8 gear looked exactly like your T7 gear but with +10 or whatever to the stats, that would be kind of boring. We pretty much have to do that for PvP, where you all could sit down today and figure out what the S12 gear will probably look like. But we don't want to do that for PvE as far as we can help it. It just makes those loot drops slightly less exciting.<br />
<br />
Believe it or not, we don't want every single piece that drops for you to be an unquestionable dps increase. We like the gameplay that goes along with evaluating when you can afford to break set bonus, meta gem stacks, when you have to regem hit because you are upgrading your hit trinket and so on. Don't turn that into me saying you should pass on all your Ulduar gear because your Naxx stuff is better. We don't want that. But we don't want the opposite extreme either, where you automatically covet anything that does drop. Like much of the game, which gear you choose when is supposed to be a choice.

<br />
Savage - Either cheaper in honor/badges/points than before or removed.<br />
Hateful - Moved to honor/badges/points that match current Savage costs<br />
Deadly - Moved to honor + points/badges that match current Hateful costs and requirements<br />
Furious - Introduced to honor + points/badges that match current Deadly costs and requirements<br />
<br />
VoA 10 man - will remain unchanged (Hateful + T7.1)<br />
VoA 25 man - will remain unchanged (Deadly + T7.25)<br />
<br />
New instance, say VoA2<br />
<br />
VoA2 10 man - Deadly + T8.1<br />
VoA2 25 man - Furious + T8.25<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Also remember that the VoA bosses drop only gloves / pants / chest.* This offers a great chance for players to get some Ulduar gear in fast order.* <br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
The same goes for my post about badges, which, if following same suit, would be as follows:<br />
<br />
Heroics + 10man bosses: Heroic badges<br />
25 man bosses + instances: Valor badges<br />
Ulduar 10 man: Valor badges<br />
Ulduar 25 man: Ulduar badges (cant remember what they are called)<br />
<br />
This would also pose the question can you stock up on some 10 man uldar gear with existing Valor badges?* A slight upgrade yes, and for those players that are clearning Naxx 25 weekly, will most likly be going strait to Ulduar 25 anyways.</div></div><hr />

He is talking about pve raid loot. Warriors, DKs and paladins want finger, trinket, back and neck with agility and they always fight with rogues, hunters, shamans and druids for that. Blizzard want separate em making mics with strength, but just in pve. Anyway any pvp item has no stat like agility or strength, there is just stamina with pure ap/sp and crit mics. So it's ok every class got same item and there can't be fight since we buy items by ourselves.

Just doing it in PvE makes no sense, if they are going to change a bunch of talents to only scale with strength then the least they could do is itemise around that assumption. The easy comparison is with the PvP caster cloaks, all cloaks have spell power, stamina and intellect and after that there are variations with haste, crit, spirit, mp5 and hit rating, yet for physical DPS you get either hit or crit. <br />
<br />
The most obvious comparison would be offering spirit or mp5. The relative differences between the two are relatively small in most cases but when some classes prefer spirit over mp5 and vice versa it makes sense to itemise for them. The same applies to Str / AP, some classes prefer Str.<br />
<br />
If they are going to adjust talent trees to make AP less desirable and Str more desirable for PvE reasons then they should make PvP items that have str on them, otherwise it amounts to a PvP nerf to those classes for the sake of simplifying PvE itemisation.</div></div><hr />

I mean there are more people playing alliance than horde, I get that, but have a look at this:<br />
<br />
Top 20: Not a single Horde Team<br />
Top 40: 2 Horde Teams<br />
Top 60: 4 Horde Teams<br />
Top 80: 9 Horde Teams<br />
Top 100: 12 Horde Teams<br />
<br />
Anyone else think that there is something wrong with that?<br />
<br />
Imo Horde &amp; Alliance should be in seperate ranking systems. Top 0.5% of horde and top 0.5% of alliance should be rewarded with gladiator.<br />
Why? Because if you got 10.000 alliance in your server, and say 2000 horde, chances are you'll find more skilled players at the alliance to try and achieve something with.<br />
<br />
Im on one of those servers where Horde is hugely unrepresented, yet im 45th rank atm and going up. Yes there are 3 times as many alliance teams above me then there is horde, and its really hard to find good teamm8s on my server.. its like we all know who are the best players, and everybody wants them! Its cozy though :)<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, i actually think top 3 (or something like that) of server should also be rewarded with glad titles. You could be the 1st position on your server, playing with the best ppl available there, yet be 50th rank or something in the battlegroup. They should give some better rewards for the top teams in the battlegroup other then just a title and a flying mount wich cant even be used in Arena to show uve got teh skillz.</div></div><hr />

I've tanked that fight at 50% aggro of that done on a Rogue and the Rogue didn't die. I've had Warriors die immediately when the healers aren't spamming secondary tanks on that fight. I'm always last to die if one of the off tanks die, and I'm always the only one to remove all stamina buffs (and I'm also always high on damage meter with no threat reducing abilities).<br />
But I've also had some pretty damned weird other incidents on that fight...<br />
All in all, I'm much less likely to trust wowwiki about tactics all in all. That site is too often wrong.<br />
<br />
Regardless, Hateful Strike (Gruul style) is in the game and will be reused since it put pressure on the healers.</div></div><hr />

Blue sockets are some kind of dmg balance mechanism from Blizzard. So you're not going all out on your best gem and get along a powerfull meta gem.<br />
<br />
With that, they open de game for other gem/metagem combos. Since that &quot;best metagem + it's requirement&quot; won't let it go way over the other options.<br />
<br />
Altough, yes, some roles have it easier, like tanks with their meta options + gems required for it (oh, so hard to find tank gear with blue sockets and a good blue gem...).</div></div><hr />

Indeed they have.<br />

That chart look EXACTLY like the ones you'd get from Season 2-4. Just replace Warrior, Druid and Rogue with Paladin and Shaman who weren't allowed to play outside the 5v5 bracket at any good level until season 4.<br />

This gives a ratio of how many times the balanced representation there is for each class in the results. A class at 1 would be perfectly balanced, 2 would mean there are twice as many of that class in the arena rankings as there should be given the population and so on.<br />
<br />
In order from highest to lowest we have:<br />
<br />
2.32 - Warlock<br />
2.01 - Paladin<br />

0.00 - Druid<br />
<br />
Now we could reasonably state that a class could be considered balanced if adding or removing 1 of that class from the numbers could swing it from being slightly overrepresented to slightly underrepresented or vice versa. If for example there was 3 mages instead of two then the mage representation would be 1.04 making the class slightly overrepresented. Since the class has to be either slightly overrepresented or slightly underrepresented then either can tentatively be called balanced. From that perspective the following classes are slightly underrepresented:<br />
<br />
Mage, Priest, Shaman<br />
<br />
And the following are slightly overrepresented:<br />
<br />
Hunter<br />
<br />
So it those four classes could tentatively be declared to be reasonably balanced (or more accurately that the data is not accurate enough to declare an imbalance).<br />
<br />
Warlock, Paladin and Death Knight are all overrepresented by a substantial margin and Warrior, Rogue, Druid are all underrepresented by a substantial margin so our final rundown is:<br />

So your telling us there are 0 Druids, Warriors and Rogues playing in every day arena? So that Rogue at 2.2k rating on my server that keeps pwning my ass must be a DK in disguise then.. <br />
<br />
Seriously make calculations based upon the thousands of ppl playing arena in every single battlegroup. Making a calculation based upon ~40 ppl is hardly hard proof those classes are underpowered or overpowered. Now im not saying those classes dont need buffs/nerfs but ppl on this thread keep taking a small chart like this as hard evidence their class is broken.<br />

I was discussing the current state of balance at the top end of arena competition. I guess I really do need to state the obvious for you. Balance can be considered at micro scales as well as at macro scales you know, and when that microcosm is, for a lot of people, the most important microcosm within the overall arena system then that discussion has merit.<br />

Your criticism seems to be based on a misguided notion of statistics. You are aware that sample size is important but what you don't seem to be aware of is that most statistical methods are based on random samples. If you take a random 30 players, look at their arena ratings and try to infer class balance from it then you will get wildly differing values, however in this case we are not dealing with a random sample. These players do not represent a random sampling of the top players, it is data based on the entire population of the top 30 players and as such a lot of the weaknesses of random sampling are mitigated. We are looking at a very specific subset of players and looking at that entire population. This makes the conclusions drawn very accurate within that specific subset of the population with of course the obvious caveat that those conclusions may be less relevant within the broader population.<br />
<br />
Of course you could just have said &quot;The sample size is too small to draw accurate data from&quot; to which I could have replied &quot;Yes, but bear in mind the sample is not a random sample but a specific sample of top level players&quot; and the matter would have been resolved quickly and easily. Instead you implied that I made statements which I didn't make so you could try to appear to be oh, so clever, scathing and sarcastic in your reply and I called you on it. Since then you are just ignoring any points I make and making up some random trollish nonsense. <br />
<br />
So please, if you must reply again at least choose specific points I make and address them specifically rather than addressing deliberate misquotes and making vague claims of QQ.<br />

Conclusions drawn based on data about the top arena teams can only be believed accurate with a reasonable degree of certainty within that context. The level of correlation between class strength and the composition of top level arena teams is debatable and even if that correlation is high then it is still possible the top level data differs substantially from overall balance.<br />

If you would take a random sample however, those calculations would be more accurate. You could then devide them over different ranks/ratings and make a conclusion. You took the top 10 teams in an Arena Tournament. This is not random as you said, and ofc there can be conclusions drawn upon it. But you said the classes that are overrepresented as overpowered, and classes underrepresented underpowered. That are not facts, its an opinion. And nothing can be drawn from it.<br />

<br />
Are some people really that blindfolded or just ignorant, because of &quot;=&quot;?<br />
<br />
Overrepresentation can mean many things. Sure saying that overrepresentation is equal to overpowerness is very broad stereotype among many players, especially with whose main is underrepresented in Arena.<br />
<br />
But really don't deny that Paladin and DK numbers are very high for the sole reason of enormous versatility, interoperability, damage mitigation, healing and way easier gameplay than most other classes.<br />
<br />
It is everyone right to decide if that is OP or not.<br />
<br />
Due to common human nature to take the easy way out that shouldn't really surprise us. The most worrying part is that Blizz devs sure do a very lousy job of class balancing regarding PvP!</div></div><hr />

You could then devide them over different ranks/ratings and make a conclusion. You took the top 10 teams in an Arena Tournament. This is not random as you said, and ofc there can be conclusions drawn upon it. But you said the classes that are overrepresented as overpowered, and classes underrepresented underpowered. That are not facts, its an opinion. And nothing can be drawn from it.<br />
<br />
I dont think any Blizzard employee would disagree with that<br />
<br />
<br />
mute seems to think that the statistics revealed by the specific selection of classes used by the top 30 players is not sufficient grounds to suggest which classes are OP or UP, and that random selection should play a key role in reflecting the pvp ability of various classes<br />
<br />
wrong, simply consider the following senario:<br />
<br />
If DKs were banned for this particular tourament, what would happen? would there suddenly be rogues/druids/warriors included in the top 30? or would there be more of the other better represented classes (paly/lock/hunter)? why would this be? and what if we banned paly? hunter? warlock? will we see any rogues/druids/warriors then? yes/no? why?<br />
<br />
the reason? obvious. because this was not a random sample to start with, each of the top 30 players had the same starting selection of classes to select from, and then over a course of time, made decisions on which class combos to go for, and went with it, consider this the same as golf clubs, why would Tiger Woods use specific clubs for specific shots? would he had made some some shots using different clubs? (clubs and classes are both just choices of tools to serve the purpose at hand)<br />
<br />
hence, Blizz actually over did it, always claiming that rogues' stunlock was too powerful, against the majority of the bg clothie heros wearing 100 resili (which is a large group of their customers), nerfed them to the ground, and now look, no rogues, same as druids and warriors <br />
<br />
the only valid argument you could come up from looking at the top 30, is that, those particular combinations of classes are more effective than the others, this is not to say, that there are no skilled rogues/druids/warriors, rather, just that any combination of arena 3s team including rogues/druids/warriors make them inviable, not as effective, in competing against the selected classes combos showed by the top 30 here<br />
<br />
in short, instead of admitting that they messed up with some classes, Blizz is claiming that arena is a SMALL aspect of the game, an e-sport, and that the average joe should just take bgs as the real pvp, which would suggest that, if WOW continues to thrive in the coming future, we will be seeing better rewards for the average joes, a down-scale of the excitement factor in arenas, and most probably, 40man AV teams competitions, fighting for the glory of the alliance/horde as they race to zerg down the pve npc leaders ROFL</div></div><hr />

I hear what your saying. But balance in arena shouldnt be based around single classes. Pala/DK and Pala/Hunter are good setups sure, but consider this:<br />
<br />
DK/Hunter, DK/Warlock, Warlock/Hunter, Pala/Warlock and 2x DK, 2x Pala, 2x Hunter, 2x Lock arent that good setups (not the worst either). I myself find it no problem to gimp a dk/pala, so for me they are not OP.. more like farmable. Also consider Dks are a new class, unknown by many players how to handle them, and a popular class above all.<br />
Also Paladins and Hunters never were good in Arena, and it only makes sense that they are now after all the pvp buffs theyve recieved.<br />
<br />
Making claims sertain classes are OP based on the top 10 arena teams this 1st season after everyone got new skills/playstyles/new rating system/new team combos etc are not valid, but is sertainly a thing that should be looked at. And i believe they did that. I just dont like fingerpointing the OP classes based upon a handfull of good players.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emulous</div><div class="date">2009-03-26, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really don't know what to say.. these changes look totally bollocks tbh even after 5 seasons (25 months?+) they still can't even get the basics correct (entry level weapons, set and set bonus itemization, arena point sink, rings for all classes/specs) and just make everything more complex..<br />
<br />
The only thing I'll say for them is that I have not met very many team booster or 2000+ rated teams in the 1700-1800 bracket and for that I am greatful.<br />
<br />
But its a great shame because even tho I'm not very good at the arena (1748 rating) it's basically the only reason I play the game and each season it gets worse and worse... It makes me very sad to be sitting around with 4000 arena points at 1748 rating still using a blue level 78 rep reward for a weapon and unable to buy anything of use because I either have better from PVE, VOA or because currently my setup (mage+rogue) one of the worst comps atm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first, we are talking about 3s, the top 30 (or 20, since its 10 teams) arena 2s would most definitly be a completely different*combination of selected classes and hence different statistics, you cannot compare 3s and 2s - the senario is not the same<br />
<br />
second, we are not talking about which classes YOU think are or are not OP/UP, rather, we are talking about what we can conclude from looking at the top 30 arena 3s statistics, a specific population of skilled/talented people that are familiar with the current pvp mechanics - my example of banning of DKs means that, what would happen on the class combination spread in the 3s arena tourament without DKs? and if you still cannot visualize that the result would be:<br />
<br />
1) more of paly/locks/hunts; and<br />
2) probably none or just 1-2 of rogues/druids/warriors;<br />
<br />
then you didn't get my point, further, while it is true DKs are a new class and would have the element of surprize (to the bg clothie heros wearing 100 resili, most likely ROFL), this is not true for this group of 30 players - they know what's going on, it's not like DKs performing well happened yesterday<br />
<br />
in short, one can conclude and infer from the given information, that, (sorry to tell you this) by finger pointing, certain classes are OP and UP, if all classes could infact, as you suggest, perform equally in arena 3s situations, then all classes would be equally represented by the top 30, remember, random selection does not take into play here, these are the TOP 30 with specific choices of their tools aiming to win, and not just a preference of ice-cream flavors</div></div><hr />
