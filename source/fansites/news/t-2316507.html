As a US based company it is probably easier to hire and pay someone in US.</div></div><hr />

I can imagine it’s due to tax rules. Mmo-champio is owned by Curse and it’s a US company. Ergo it’s easier to hire US residents.</div></div><hr />

legal/tax technicalities aside, if you are working for/with a US based team the time difference will make things very hard when you are 6-9 hours ahead.<br />

<br />
You know, when applying for a job it helps to actually read the job description before asking questions. It clearly says pay is commensurate with qualifications and experience level. Failing to do so and then asking a question it already answered doesn't look good to an employer. <br />
<br />
Why would a work-from-home job require dental and optical benefits? I'd kind of understand these benefits if they had to travel to the premises and all, but... heck, here in the UK dental and optical benefits aren't really that common. A few companies offer it but most don't. When you're just looking for a website guy who works from home, it's not really the sort of thing you offer. It's more of a thing you offer your commuting, day-in-day-out office staff.</div></div><hr />

its not a strange question at all - unless they are planing to hire a student or fresh graduate specialist needs to know if its even worth his time to apply .<br />
<br />
only people without much experience are afraid to put the question about wages and benefit very early in job interview. else you effectively &quot;waste&quot; time only to learn that job is paying shit money .</div></div><hr />

It's a contract position, not a regular full time job. That typically means no benefits. Hours are probably based on the amount of work that needs done in a given week.</div></div><hr />
