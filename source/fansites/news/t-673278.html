Now that's a surprise! European players have to merge on eu.battle.net (http://eu.battle.net/) and US players on us.battle.net (http://us.battle.net/). <br />
A few months ago, we unveiled the Battle.net account, our new way for players to log in to World of Warcraft and future Blizzard games, sign up for upcoming beta tests, shop the online Blizzard Store, and more with just one username and password. This was just the first step in the rollout of the brand-new Battle.net; in the future, players will be able to use Battle.net to participate in cross-realm chat in World of Warcraft, create real-life friends lists, communicate across different games, and a whole lot more.<br />
<br />
In preparation for the launch of these new features, on November 11, 2009, all current World of Warcraft players will be required to merge their World of Warcraft accounts with a Battle.net account in order to log in to the game. As our way to say “thanks” for taking a moment to go through the process, existing World of Warcraft accounts that upgrade to Battle.net (including those that have already switched over) will receive a brand-new penguin in-game pet -- check for him in your in-game mailbox later this week. Starting on November 11, all World of Warcraft players will need to log in to the game using a Battle.net username and password, and anyone who wishes to create a new World of Warcraft account will need to start with a Battle.net account.<br />
<br />
Creating a Battle.net account is simple and free. To merge your existing account with a Battle.net account, visit http://us.battle.net . For more info, check out the Battle.net site or read the FAQ: http://us.battle.net/faq/index.html<br />
Q: What happens if I don’t merge my World of Warcraft account with a Battle.net account?<br />
A: After November 12, 2009, you won’t be able to log in to the game unless you merge your account with a Battle.net account. You will need to log in using your Battle.net account username (your email address) and password.<br />
<br />
Q: How can I obtain the penguin pet?<br />
A: Once you’ve successfully merged a World of Warcraft account with a Battle.net account, the penguin pet will be sent via in-game mail to all existing characters on the merged World of Warcraft account, along with all future characters on that World of Warcraft account. Players who merged previously will also receive the pet this way.<br />
<br />
Q: Do I need to merge by a certain date in order to receive the penguin?<br />
A: We plan to remove the ability to get the penguin pet at some point in the future, we haven’t determined exactly when just yet.<br />
<br />
Q: If I create a new World of Warcraft account, will I receive the pet?<br />
A: Only existing World of Warcraft accounts that merge with a Battle.net account are eligible to receive the penguin pet. If you create a new Battle.net account after November 11 and merge an existing World of Warcraft account with it you will still be able to receive the pet. However, please note that we plan to remove the ability to get the penguin pet at some point in the future.<br />
<br />
The penguin will most likely be Oswald (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/55068/oswald/) (also known as Mr. Chilly, he was renamed in the latest PTR build of Patch 3.3 but Oswald is a nice name (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_%28comics%29) too), Mr. Chilly was the pet given to US beta testers who converted their account to Battle.net when the feature was on WotLK beta servers. Please note that Pengu (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/44723/nurtured-penguin-egg/) was also changed in Patch 3.3 and doesn't have his scary red eyes anymore. <br />

there is a reason there is a tick box on the login screen :) for the lazy typers<br />

if you are worried about security maybe update your antivirus and spyware software and check your system before you merge or update to some decent antivirus/spyware :D</div></div><hr />

Not really, no, you're just giving them even clearer information. Absolutely everything has access to your clipboard, if you're just going to copy your password then it doesn't even need to record your keystrokes, it already has it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes. If you merge two accounts into the same battle.net account then you can play them both at the same time on both computes. If you're worried about your brother because of that, why not have a separate battle.net account each?</div></div><hr />

That we know of, since the whole thing is still pretty early:<br />
<br />
Your account won't be closed on the 11/12th.<br />
 You can opt-in for Blizzard beta tests.<br />
Keep track of CD keys if you have, either now or in the future, multiple Blizzard games.<br />
Ability to purchase from the Blizzard store.<br />
(Soon) Ability to communicate to people on different factions, of different realms, of different regions, hell of different games.<br />
(Soon) Account wide achievements.<br />
<br />
<br />
Surprisingly few people know about the second point. There's a page on the battle.net account management that lets you opt-in to future Blizzard games, including for World of Warcraft. In short, you can already sign up early for Cataclysm beta tests :D</div></div><hr />

So you dont trust him with his own account? But you trust him with yours? To start with what harm can he do with his own account, that he cant do on yours?<br />
<br />
You know having two account bound to the same battle.net account shares the same login and password.</div></div><hr />

This is why you use a program like KeePass that keeps the password in your clipboard for 12seconds before clearing it.</div></div><hr />

However after I got back from Blizzcon I wanted my Grunty as soon as possible. So I made the change. <br />
<br />
There's been a couple times where I couldn't log in because of battle.net problems. Overall though it hasn't been too bad and the problems have seemed to have vanished as of late. I guess if there are any problems with it, come Nov. no one will notice anyway since everyone will be on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not one problem for me ever since I changed over and I was among one of the early abopters of the BNet account system, thats not to say nothing has happened because of it, but so far I've either missed them or taken It for granted that something was happening that everyone else besides the BNet accounts was experiencing.<br />
<br />
With this said, I dare say there might be some stability issues with the mass migration of people to BNet accounts come 11th November. I'll save my criticisms for when and if this (stability issues) happens.</div></div><hr />

Change can be hard to accept/adopt, true story. Hell can't go through a PTR forum (or any official WoW one for that matter) without coming across a &quot;When I was young, we hiked 300 miles thru the snow to get to X and now you want me to catch the bus?&quot; post.<br />

Why not merge both battle.net's, instead of having one for US and another for EU, and let us post on the US forums and get some answers to our questions from the developers, and not just post theorycrafting stuff on the EU forums knowing that none with developing power will ever read it?</div></div><hr />

Just a quick question, you say you merged all the accounts into 1 B/net account? yer? so dose that mean you all can play all at the same time? For example if it were 2 accounts you merged, 1 you play and 1 you wife plays, you and your wife/partener play together at the same time?<br />
<br />
sorry to be so...cryptic, just a few people I have asked the question of, seem to get confused as to what I'm trying to find out. the reason I ask is becouse I was going to merge my 2 accounts, mine and the wifes, but as we were about to hit teh final &quot;OK&quot; button, there was a message saying something like you can only play 1 account at a time, as in, I couldn't play at the same time my wife was, IF we had gone ahead with the merge. <br />
<br />
Any help appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any help appreciated.As far as I am aware, you can play both at the same time. When you log in under your B.Net account, you get a list of all the merged WoW accounts and can choose which WoW account to log into.<br />
<br />
Only one person can play any one WoW account at a time, but AFAIK multiple WoW accounts under one unified B.Net account can be played at once, yes.</div></div><hr />

I asked your question on the forums and someone replied with this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, you can play at the same time. All you do is chose the account name you want to play as.<br />
<br />
So say your WOW account name is HUSBAND and your wife's WOW account name is WIFE<br />
<br />
When you login to WOW, you will get a pop up box of what account name you want to play as.</div></div><hr />

Would be really nice but I think it would be much harder to keep together with so many ppl and also maintenance would be hard since you would shoot down some ppl in peak hours.

The actual merging process for my two accounts seemed to go smoothly; just click the merge button and enter the account details followed by an annoying noise and two confirmation emails. Whenever I try to use the new battlenet details to log in it tells me there is no wow account associated with that account. Whenever I use the old login details for my Horde account it tells me &quot;This account has been merged, use your battlenet details.&quot; My alliance account still works with the old details, but there is no penguin.<br />

Not really. You may be paying for it, but what does that matter? Do you have to pay any more or less now? You can merge without a paying account too, so it's pretty irrelevant. If you really need an example of companies that do this, because lots of companies do similar things now and again, the #1 thing that comes to mind is paypal - occasionally you will be required by paypal to spend a minute looking over your account details to make sure they're correct, and then submit the form to confirm. In other words, you're required to fill in a form and you can't use your account until you do. Sound familiar?<br />

Considering the news has just gone up on the blizzard launcher, it's safe to assume a good part of the playerbase has just decided to merge. The website can't take that load (a few million people), and thus is temporarily unavailable. Give it a week to let it settle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been having a lot of connection issues over the past few months. About half the time when I login I am immediately &quot;Disconnected from server&quot;. Usually after the 2nd or 3rd time trying to login all is well. Until now I never really thought about it might be a B.net issue, because my wife's WoW account (not a B.net account) doesn't have that issue.<br />
<br />
I also got DC'd many times in Ulduar last night. I checked my internet connection and even did some traffic analysis between my computer and the data center of the server I play on and there were no issues. My FPS was about 40 when I DC'd each time, so that wasn't it. Maybe B.net accounts have more background communications going on or something like that which may cause the WoW connection to get overloaded more easily if a lot is going on?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Facts : You can merge more than one account on a single bnet account.<br />
Facts : You can play all of your accounts at the same time, even if they are merged.<br />
Facts : You can check remember account name and won't have to type your super duper ultra mega giga long e-mail 20 thousand times per day. Actually, if your current account name is a1b2c3 go to hotmail/gmail/yahoo/whatever and create a a1b2c3@gmail.com.<br />
Facts : If you are worried about security, authenticator is your best friend, and to use an authenticator you need Bnet.<br />
Facts : On maintenance days you cannot log in into bnet, since authenticating servers are down, but loggin in on maintenance is cool, if you enjoy watching your start up screen.<br />
Facts : There will be less noobs playing after November 12th.<br />
Facts : If you bought your account over ebay your account will get closed as soon as you merge, because you need to match the name and adress figuring in your current bnet account, failure to succesfully prove and provide that information will close your account. But that's okay, we hate your for doing illicit business anyway.<br />
Facts : If after merging you cannot log into your account (excluding maintenance downtime) you should CALL Blizzard, their employees can un-merge your account and/or reset e-mail/pword to solve the issue, and it's the only way of solving it.<br />
Facts : L2read the whole main blue post if you have questions about the pet.<br />
<br />
Only ''known'' downside, with an easy solution is : If you and your mother/father/brother/wife/kid play on two accounts, if you merge em both, you will all share the same password/authenticator. Simple solution : Merge each account to a different bnet account.<br />

b) Will i get a pet<br />

But both the complaint and question have dumb-proof answers.</div></div><hr />

No matter how you wanne explain that, it is still not Justified. <br />
<br />
<br />
Then stop giving Blizzard your money and go find something else to occupy your time. Volunteer at a clinic. Paint your house. Learn to do fly. Start a garden. Anything, so that we don't have to listen to you bitch about something you can't do anything about anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they wanted to change the overall look, fine, but there's no reason why they couldn't still be red so that the two penguins wouldn't look so much alike.<br />
<br />
Instead of beady little red demonic eyes, Pengu could have big, cutesy red demonic eyes.<br />
<br />
(sigh)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact: If you're a UKer and agree to the B.net agreement, Blizzard can sue you for £50,000 every time you engage in PvP and the other guy dosn't like it.<br />
<br />
&quot;But Blizzard wouldn't do that!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Then why the fuck is it in their user agreement? This is about legal powergrabs, no more and no less. And that example's one of the less objectionable terms.</div></div><hr />

LOL, I do agree, I found a Bizzard contact to ask one of the questions I poised here, answer below...<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting the World of Warcraft Game Master Department. <br />
<br />
Answer: : <br />
My family plays World of Warcraft together. Should we create a single Battle.net account for all of our World of Warcraft accounts?<br />
A: No. Sharing access to a World of Warcraft account, other than by a parent or guardian with a single minor, is a violation of World of Warcraft’s Terms of Use. You should create a separate Battle.net account for each family member’s World of Warcraft account. In addition, future Battle.net features will make it beneficial for players to have the Battle.net account they use associated with their own online identity. Creating separate accounts for you and your family ensures you will be able to take advantage of these features when they are introduced later on.<br />
<br />
Should you require further assistance, please submit another help request the next time you are online. We hope you continue to enjoy your experience in World of Warcraft!<br />

Just FYI, and wanted to thank the guys who basicly said the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Facts : If you are worried about security, authenticator is your best friend, and to use an authenticator you need Bnet.<br />
<br />
<br />
This fact isn't quite correct. Blizzard offers two authenticator options.<br />
1)The physical keychain sized authenticator.<br />
2)A cell-phone application.<br />
<br />
#2 only works with Bnet<br />
#1 works just fine without it<br />
<br />
Of course, on Nov11 it becomes true by default.</div></div><hr />
