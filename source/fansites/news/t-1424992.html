Flying and Gameplay<br />
Using a flight path to automate travel between predetermined travel points isn't an argument to remove the need to be on the ground and work toward objectives through combat and exploration in a dangerous/challenging environment.<br />
<br />
These things are not linked just because a flight path is &quot;flight&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is a problem they need to fix. Gameplay should not only exist in raids and Arena. <br />
Both of which don't allow flying.<br />
<br />
Not because the mobs don't hit hard enough but because it's easy as hell to skirt around their aggro range and not aggro them in the first place.<br />
I've seen this response more than a few times, and it falls into the same line of reasoning. &quot;Because I can put thought and effort into potentially avoiding &quot;unnecessary&quot; combat, those combat situations shouldn't exist.&quot; The same could be said of almost any content or mechanic or system, but it isn't a good argument for its removal as a part of the game.<br />
<br />
Well of course not they are both very small environments that teams enter to work toward a common goal and therefore share nothing with the wide open world of wow where we used to be free to explore by every means possible.<br />
<br />
So being able to fly in AV wouldn't make it easier to fly over combat to capture objectives? Being able to fly in a raid wouldn't trivialize encounters and remove the need to progress through the content, fly to the last boss, etc.? You can quest in a group of people, does that then negate your desire to fly and trivialize outdoor content?<br />
<br />
I think you guys are missing the point that you still do have to fight. GC didn't want people swooping in on prison cages, but you need keys to open them which require you to kill mobs.<br />
I think you'd appreciate more variety in your quests than kill collections. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/286560-i-just-spent-close-to-5-minutes/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10973087437?page=9#162))<br />

Subrace Fan Art<br />
Shoc put together some nice subrace mockups on the forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1415502-Sub-Race-Photoshop-Mockups?) recently. Keep in mind this is just fan art!<br />

Subraces in WoW<br />
What do you think about adding subrace options to WoW? Keep in mind that time spent creating new textures and model tweaks for this would take away from the time spent on other art. The same applies for any lore and in game story that could be created to go along with them. <br />
<br />
It appears Chris Robinson (Senior Art Director) took a look (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/410512663278411776) and liked the idea, with custom skins (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/410581357136330752) being something that he would like to see one day as well.<br />
<br />
Other than that, the latest we have heard about subraces from the developers was in an interview (www.mmo-champion.com/content/3552-Blizzcon-Dev-Interview-Character-Re-Customization-Blue-Posts-Blizzcon-Pictures):<br />
<br />
<br />
The team has talked about more customization, such as sub races, for a long time. Some would require different models with different textures. A good way to give players access to the different races would also be required. Perks for the different sub races might also be interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
We also saw a mention of subraces a year or so ago in another interview (www.mmo-champion.com/content/2932-Best-Buy-Developer-Q-A):<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Recently in Twitter Ghostcrawler mentioned the possibility of making subraces such as Maghar orcs and Wildhammer dwarfs available with the player character model updates, how high chance is there that this would also allow us to play as Broken or Taunka?<br />
A: If we ever opened up more races, I suspect we'd be pretty liberal about it, but to be clear, that feature is no more than a twinkle in some designer's eye at this stage.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yig</div><div class="date">2013-12-21, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People need to just shut up about developer time being used for things. There is not ever going to be anything everyone agrees developer time should be spent on, and everything takes developer time. It's just superfluous to have to qualify &quot;this would take developer time from something else&quot; as if anything is actually officially and objectively worth developer time. It's unnecessary to constantly have to throw in that qualifier as if there's any feature with an alternative. We all know everything we wants takes finite developer time. A rich character creation system is always superior to some raid we're only going to have relevant for a few months before we move on to yet another one. My character has lasted me almost 10 YEARS now, meanwhile he's had nothing to show but armor sets and some cheap hairstyles recycled from another race. <br />
<br />
There will always be neat details the devs are working on that aren't requested. Nobody ever asked for Blizzard to give up an animation for when we open our maps. So let's just stop acting like that's important when talking about things we'd like to see put into the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luciferka</div><div class="date">2013-12-21, 10:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think its quite unimportant. Character creation gives you a variety of options to costumize your avatar. You can have green, brown, pale orc, or an undead with glowing eyes or without them, etc. Its just not written there, that if u choose different skin color your subrace would be different. And who is playing naked with his avatar? At the end, all you will be see from your new subrace avatar is his head from the back. If the new subraces gives some new button to push, something racial specific, it would be nice, but if not, its worthless. Rather spend time and effort into new expansion (lore, raids, enviroment, quests) cause im sick of pandas :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main ones that are 'needed' that pop to mind are<br />
<br />
Undead/Forsaken. - This one is needed SUPER bad there needs to be some strong lore depicting just who ranks with the Forsaken, after all there were tons of High Elves that were raised by the Lich King among his ranks. <br />
<br />
Wildhammer Dwarves/Black Rock Dwarves - These guys kind of just need new markings and skin tones to depict the other Dwarven subraces.<br />
<br />
Outland Orcs - Just markings are fine but having it 'start' in the Outland Zone would be cool too!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaenavenBlacksun</div><div class="date">2013-12-21, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's see, we have a Leper Gnome in Undercity, along with plenty of lore based undead elves and half-races running around in various stories (if not in-game). So, there wouldn't need to be any lore to back those up. Plenty of half-races in the human cities, so no need for Lore there. Thanks to the Counsel, adding Dark Iron and Wildhammer skins wouldn't need explaining (I thought there was something that was almost dark iron in the skin tones already). Given how long the Highborne lived away from the other Night Elves, some of them could stand to look a little different (meaning something nearing High Elf features but not quite). Blood Elves should have, at least, some blue-green eye colours given that the Sunwell was purified back in Burning Crusade. Playing something like a Taunka would involve some stretching (i.e. unlocking). How long has it been since Burning Crusade? I don't think we need to explain away all the various non-evil Orc colourations, at this point. Aside from that ONE group of forest Trolls in Hinterlands, none of the other Troll groups would bother joining the Horde (especially after Vol'Jin humiliated them in Shadows of the Horde). Varying levels of Leprosy could only be logical since all the new gnomes actually come from Gnomeregan, now.<br />
<br />
Did I cover everyone?<br />

<br />
<br />
If it would be cosmetic customisation only I'm fine with it, but if I ever see pathetic ass Broken added as a different kind of draenei I'll rage quite hard.<br />
Oh yeah. Them. Aren't they supposed to suffer from some sort of limitations, given that they more or less had a falling out with the Naaru and the other Draenei? Aside from a VERY select few major characters between BC and Earthen Ring, I don't see how they'd logically fit into the scheme of things (unless they were auto-90'd).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would definitely help their business in the long run for people who are interested in customising their character rather than having to look at all the other characters all around them and imagine they're like that, like roleplayers.<br />
<br />
Green trolls please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They would need some sort of epic quest to unlock though, and thats where the work comes in, because for some of the skins, it's a literal colour change, no work at all, but the work is implementing it right, making it more than a couple collect X quests and get a new toggle.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure about perks to subraces though, I think they'd have to have them noncombat, which would be fine, otherwise we will all be going Dark Iron Dwarf for the DPS cooldown.<br />
<br />
During development of the models, right now, is the perfect time to do this though, another reason to be pumped for the models, and another reason to draw back old players, but I'd imagine it's going to be a &quot;We'd love to do it, but xxxxxxx&quot;, see you in 5 years sort of thing, sadly.</div></div><hr />

A few I could think of off the top of my head that I wouldn't mind seeing: <br />
<br />
Nightelf-based Worgen (the original Worgen were Nightelven druids)<br />
Highborne (somewhere between a Night elf and a High elf)<br />
High elves<br />
Non-worgen Gilneans (the emote set is already there!)<br />
The two other factions of Dwarves, of course<br />
Broken Draenei<br />

Uhm not sure if Bashiok just troll or idiot... Arena is just 100x100 room, you don't have to waste 30 mins to get from one side to another and in raids there's teleports &quot;every 100 yards&quot; or if no teleports then raid design doesn't require you to run for 30 mins.<br />
<br />
Put teleports in open world in every quest hub and I won't QQ about flying.</div></div><hr />

Uhm not sure if Bashiok just troll or idiot... Arena is just 100x100 room, you don't have to waste 30 mins to get from one side to another and in raids there's teleports &quot;every 100 yards&quot; or if no teleports then raid design doesn't require you to run for 30 mins.<br />
<br />
Put teleports in open world in every quest hub and I won't QQ about flying.<br />

Well, would you look at that, they're still hiring people.<br />
<br />
Just like always.<br />
<br />
<br />
FYI, &quot;throw more money at it&quot; is a pretty poor design strategy. You're making the mistake of thinking that an unlimited number of qualified, skilled, motivated designers are just floating around in the ether for anyone to grab when they need a project to speed up.<br />
<br />
Even if they could, it wouldn't guarantee an increase in development speed or that the things you specifically want to see implemented would get prioritized. Especially when you consider how iterative Blizzard's design process is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is just not true if all you want is new textures.<br />
<br />
This art is going to be done anyway for all the Mag'har and Wildhammer NPCs running around in the game. The entire point of Shoc's mockups, was to show skins that will need to be developed for NPCs on models that will already be developed (except for maybe the Mechagnome). The only work involved would be to increase an index on &quot;skin color&quot; in player creation.<br />
<br />
Now, once you start talking Taunka and Broken, this argument goes out the window, and yes, a ton of time will need to be spent on new models. I personally, don't want that. Just let us use the NPC skins, that will need to be developed anyway for the new models, on the new player models.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Keep in mind that time spent creating new textures and model tweaks for this would take away from the time spent on other art. The same applies for any lore and in game story that could be created to go along with them.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would be okay with sub-races under 2 conditions:<br />
<br />
1: Remove racials. This should be done whether we have sub-races or not. Make race a cosmetic/lore choice so people can be the race they want to be instead of the one with the best racials for what they want to do.<br />
2: No unlocking process. Subraces should be selected at character creation. Again, it's a cosmetic/lore choice, nobody should be forced to play a character that isn't them to unlock the one they want to be. This isn't like transmog, you aren't born with gear on.</div></div><hr />

They can't even finish the normal races and you people want them to add sub races with unlocking mechanisms? This is something they'd do with the expansion after WoD but for WoD. If they were to try to add it to WoD it would push launch back god knows how long. Do you want to do SOO for that much longer? Or the same lame pvp?<br />

I don't think so.<br />

This is an expansion or major patch feature not something that can be realistically added into WoD now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some races can compensate for lack of sub-races with just more customization options. All sub-races are are additional customization options after all. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Human - Azotha (http://i.imgur.com/yKyoFh4.jpg) (Vrykul Features), Asian Humans (a la Wu Shen (http://www.wowhead.com/npc=5479/))<br />
Night Elf - Highborne Skin Variants (http://static4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130625122557/wowwiki/images/c/ca/Highborne_of_zin_azshari_by_vaanel-d4m0an5.jpg) (Basically more radiant, sparkly magic skin) and Demon Hunter Tattoos. (http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/wowpedia.org/3/39/DemonrunesNEMale.jpg)<br />
Worgen - Non Snarly Faces (http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/1668/21212l.jpg)<br />
Draenei - ? <br />
<br />
<br />
Troll - With the Troll leaders defeated by the Horde in the Throne of Thunder, it wouldn't be too far fetched for some of them to join the Horde. <br />
Blood Elf - Lich King is dead, and the Valk'yr aligned themselves with the Forsaken, maybe some San'layn did as well. Very far fetched though. But Cool Factor &gt; Lore sometimes.<br />
Goblin - ?<br />
<br />
Also, the wax museum Danny Trejo was my attempt at making the undead face alive, not really a sub-race lol</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peacemoon</div><div class="date">2013-12-21, 10:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope. It's just wasting of time.<br />

Simple example: go to outland, take flight path from black temple (depends if you aldor/scryer) to tempest keep. 15 minutes of wasted time. Why if you can fly there in about 2-3 minute just using flying mount?<br />
<br />
Before you qq &quot;wah old content&quot; - doesn't matter. It's just example of HORRIBLE design (flight paths).<br />
<br />
Honestly, flight paths provide you with a few minutes break. If you want to stare at your character doing nothing for the entire time that is your problem. Apart from the 1-60 zones, no flight path is that time consuming. You would really have to stretch it to even get anywhere near proving your case. I.e Jade Forest to Townlong Steppes etc.<br />
<br />
Not to mention 15 minute hearthstones and portals to every capital city.</div></div><hr />

Human-- uncursed Gilnean. (Different voices, different selection of hair colors...) You could also do different racial perks for the other human kingdoms.<br />
<br />
Night Elf-- If you want to get technical, high elves are a long-separated subrace of night elves.... Also, Shen'dralar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the Orcs, how hard is it to just give them a secondary option, and change the name of Bloodfury to: <br />
<br />
Mag'har - Ancestor's Fury <br />
Dragonmaw - Dragonfury or something. <br />
<br />
Granted, all the issue seems to be is changed racials. I understand that can create balance issues, but they don't HABE to be combat oriented. Or even exist. <br />
<br />
Still though, I like the &quot;we'd probably be generous with them&quot; outlook, considering Dwarves have at least 4 good ones, Orcs have 3-4 potentials (Mag'har, Dragonmaw, maybe Mok'nathal, and one other) Trolls have a BUNCH, etc. <br />

Really hope to see Mag'har+Dragonmaw and the dwarf options in WoD, because there's really no reason NOT to have them at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My hope is that after the initial model revamp they are able to add most character customization in general as well as sub race models. Would be ecstatic if they could get this done anywhere between 6.0 and 6.2.</div></div><hr />

We don't need brand new starting zones or new quests or even &quot;unlocks&quot; to play as the races. Just give us the option to play as them simple as that. <br />

Sure Outlands had intriguing lands, too. But, many lands are more like boring deserts or boring forests. Please create cool deserts and cool forests.<br />
<br />
Dull landscape is something that is put together half heartedly. Better one is actually made so that it looks full of adventuring possibilities, variety of terrain, etc.<br />
<br />
One example of dull landscape was in the water region: Sure there was also cool corals and stuff, but then later it started to be just greenish grayish dullness in the area where were massive army fights.<br />
<br />
Now people have said that why another orc-expansion. Well yeah, why? The content is created from scratch, but I don't really trust that the content will be really original. For example I have seen cartoonish hills with few trees already many times.<br />
<br />
And the dungeons started to be more like hallways. I would like to have different kinds of terrains in dungeons too. Not only huge hallways and even bigger rooms.</div></div><hr />

Alliance should mainly be Alliance. Horde should mainly be Horde, not include leper gnomes and whatever that should be their enemies. A few NPCs here and there works, but I don't want thousands of them in form of players.<br />
Yes, it's a magical world, but I like that there are certain rules and restrictions. Just as I feel like dumbing down the professions(for example) is ruining the game and makes it feel less like a world, the same way I feel about this.<br />

If adding more variety makes you consider quitting the game, then good riddance. You're seriously equating the addition of pokemon, anime, and furbys to adding playable races that already exist within the game. You have no argument whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

Textual explanations would suffice in these cases, and it would be easier than centering whole chunks of content around exposition. That said, I'm glad to see Chris Robinson shares my own enthusiasm for Mechagnomes!</div></div><hr />

Troll - Forest Trolls (Revantusk tribe, already allies with the Horde)<br />
Tauren - Taunka (They're alredy in the Horde)<br />
Forsaken - The Val'kyrs could revive any race of Lordaeron, Trolls, Elves, etc..Am I the only that can picture Sylvanas killing and reviving High Elves to fight for her?<br />
Blood Elves - Hmm, I don't know, maybe some Felblood Elves? They could use the same excuse used with the Highborne and the Night Elves in Cataclysm...<br />
Goblins - Hobgoblins maybe?<br />
<br />
Humans - Hmm, they could change some aspects from the ppl of Gilneas and add some of them that are free from the curse as a subrace for humans...<br />
Dwarves - Dark Iron and Wildhammer (Alredy in the Alliance)<br />
Gnomes - Cured Leper gnomes maybe? (Sand Gnomes as an alternative choice)<br />
Night Elves - They missed the oportunitie to create a subrace when they introduced the Highborne back in Cataclysm..Well, they could easly change that...<br />
Draenei - Broken (*-*)<br />
Worgen - Yeah, I'm stuck in this one...<br />
<br />
Pandaren - Who cares...</div></div><hr />

Leper gnomes are supposed to be our enemies. My argument is lore and immersion.</div></div><hr />
