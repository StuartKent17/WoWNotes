<br />
General<br />
<br />
Copied Test Realm characters are not copied with their achievement history in order to better facilitate the character copy process.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
<br />
&lt;ul&gt;<br />
&lt;li&gt;Many class talents, spells, and abilities have been overhauled, added, or removed.<br />
&lt;li&gt;All spell and ability tooltips will now display damage averages rather than minimum and maximum damage potential. This feature is on by default but can be changed via the Display settings under User Interface options.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Ammo has been removed from the game.<br />
&lt;li&gt;The character levels at which classes gain new spells and abilities have changed.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Many item and class stats have been changed or removed.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Rage has been normalized.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Spells and abilities no longer have multiple ranks and now scale with character level.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Talent trees have been altered. All player talent specializations have been reset, allowing for free re-specialization.<br />
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Each specialization has been reduced to a 31-point talent tree.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Players will now get a total of 41 talent points to spend.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Players will be asked to choose a specialization at level 10. Doing so will result in the unlocking of a spell or ability unique to that specialization, as well as one or more passive bonuses.<br />
&lt;li&gt;Once a talent specialization has been chosen, players may only place points in the primary tree until at least 31 points have been spent there.<br />
&lt;li&gt;The initial announcement regarding these talent tree changes can be found on our Cataclysm forum: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=25626290449&amp;sid=1<br />

<br />
There is now a new spell fly-out UI feature for warlock pets. Clicking on this single button will open up the list of available pets to summon.<br />

<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Resilience no longer reduces the chance a player will be critically hit by an opponent.<br />
Durability: cloth, leather, and mail now have as many points of durability as plate, making the repair cost on death much closer to equal for all classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
The glyph system has been updated to now feature three different types of glyphs. Many class glyphs have been added, altered, or moved to different glyph types.<br />
<br />

Spell Alerts have been added to notify players when procs on select spells and abilities occur. A visual notification will display around the character and the activated ability will be highlighted on the action bar.<br />
The Arena Teams pane has been improved.<br />
The Character pane has been redesigned. Character stats can now be shown or hidden via the Show All Details/Hide All Details button on the bottom left. When shown, all character stats will be visible in a window to the right of the pane. Stat sections can be reorganized by clicking and dragging them up or down the pane.<br />
The Professions panes now have more filtering and search functionality, as well as buttons to easily link recipes in the chat frame.<br />
A Professions screen has been added to the Spellbook to better display the details of a character’s primary and secondary professions.<br />
Many of the yellow System Messages that would display in the chat frame when leveling up have been removed.<br />
New text animations now alert players as they level up, also providing information on when new talents, spells and abilities are available.<br />
Professions and Class Trainers windows have been altered to more clearly display available and upcoming purchases.<br />
New Raid frames are now. They can also be used in place of the standard 5-player party interface via the User Interface options.<br />

whats cata only stuff mean?<br />
<br />
It means things such as Worgens, 80-85 zones and stuff like that isn't ready. Basically just quests, new environment, talent trees etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
16gb also sounds about right for what should be released for Cat. I know Beta is something like 25gb but that would shrink once the &quot;live&quot; build is ready.<br />
<br />
Edit: 16gb could also just mean their including the Cataclysm &quot;world event&quot; that theyve been talking about. It could be hidden in the files?</div></div><hr />

It doesn't need to now. The crit chances at level 85 are like 5%.<br />

The 1-60 content isn't in the PTR, basically it's just UI and Talents/Specs that are being tested with some other basic stuff. No Flying in Azeroth either :/</div></div><hr />

The purpose of this PTR is to test out the new talent trees and new internal systems and UI changes. no World Changes at all.<br />
<br />

sad panda is me, i'll still grab it and play around with the talents</div></div><hr />

No, that's how they intend it to be now - you have to CC 2 or 3 mobs and carefully pull 1 or 2 mobs at a time. Tank threat is low, DPS threat is high, AOE dmg is crap, tank aoe is crap, healer mana regen is pitifully low and throughput is crap. They claim this is to make the game more &quot;fun&quot; though, but you're just going to have a lot fewer tanks and healers in Cata.</div></div><hr />

Actually that just means we'll be rid of the shitty players that only tanked or healed for the sake of a fast queue/raid invite, who we put up with for the sake of our own convenience, and the tanks/healers that were actually worth a damn will still be around. In other words, bad players can no longer live under the delusion that they aren't bad.</div></div><hr />

Yes even when were geared out in full crit % arena gear and get back to 40-60% crit it will still be ok because the resilience is going to lower the total damage taken even fromt he crits. The reason this is being implemented is so fire mages for example can get hot streaks, therefore making them PVP viable.</div></div><hr />

That was my point. The pre wrath patch I was talking about only changed the talent trees. It didn't give us northrend or death knights.<br />

Well I hope the drastic reduction in DPS isn't gonna be carried onto live. Or else we'd go back to the days of healers and tanks taking painfully long to solo stuff.

<br />
Yes, there will be bugs at release... some quests will have issues, etc... but the majority of content (97%+) will be fine. What you see in beta isn't even close to what they're actually working on. You'll never see the product that will be hitting store shelves on the beta realm. They'll be patching stuff through release day and after. That's why even after installing the game out of the box on release night we'll still have to download a patch before we get to play it (I remember that happening after getting WotLK at midnight). The release date announcement is getting pretty close though I think... but it is actually taking longer than I was hoping back at the start of summer.</div></div><hr />

You can use beta client. PTR does not conatin terrain changes, so some NPCs may be misplaced. There is no need to change realmlist.</div></div><hr />

What you see in beta isn't even close to what they're actually working on. You'll never see the product that will be hitting store shelves on the beta realm. They'll be patching stuff through release day and after. That's why even after installing the game out of the box on release night we'll still have to download a patch before we get to play it (I remember that happening after getting WotLK at midnight). The release date announcement is getting pretty close though I think... but it is actually taking longer than I was hoping back at the start of summer.<br />
<br />
I hope this is right. Atm in Beta they just implemented another new revamped starting zone for the Forsaken for 1 to 6 which was really nice and well done. I believe more of these starting zone revamps are coming for all races except the Belf and Draenei. The main problem is that once the client starts having issues the quests flow can become buggy and make it impossible for you to progress from one quest to the next to finnish leveling in that zone. This doesn't just happen in one area but all over the game world. There are also still invisible walls lurking around, quests that don't work any longer in a zone and are outdated or don't move with the quest flow correctly, and many other issues.<br />
<br />
I like that they are releasing this content on the PTR and hope that they can use it to get tons of data to help them further balance and rework talent trees and abilities more. It's likely that this PTR could be up on the server for 4 to 6 weeks before being released. This would most likely make a November release highly likely. <br />
<br />
We shall see on the Beta whether or not BLizz will pull this off over the next month or so as we continue to recieve patches. However I get the feeling that some areas in the 1 to 60 and 80-85 zones are more done then others. The puzzle so to speak just hasn't fully materialized as there are many gaping holes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. Some stuff will be bugged, some unfinished (Naxx dance boss had a &quot;safe spot&quot; for 2 or 3 years?, Azshara unfinished for 5 years...) , but this doesn't mean they will delay the launch. They probably won't want to miss Xmas sales, so it'll be November/(very early)December, no matter what. Odds are that PvP stuff in particular won't be fixed for about a month after launch (start of PvP season). <br />
<br />
In order to meet this seasonal deadline, they'll need to start producing DVDs by half-way through October at the latest. That's about 5 weeks away. It's then that they'll probably give a release date, so that various online stores can do pre-sales, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah you pretty much were, they changed resilience not to work against NPCs back in TBC already.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Narshe</div><div class="date">2010-09-12, 09:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually that just means we'll be rid of the shitty players that only tanked or healed for the sake of a fast queue/raid invite, who we put up with for the sake of our own convenience, and the tanks/healers that were actually worth a damn will still be around. In other words, bad players can no longer live under the delusion that they aren't bad.<br />
<br />
That applies more to DPS than it does tanks or healers. The majority of bad players are DPS, and even if they go tank or heals to queue faster they eventually learn how to play that role. The problem is narrow minded DPS who just AOE spam everything, regardless of if its a noob tank or seasoned one. <br />
<br />
Now whos fault is this? Its sad that you blame players and not BLIZZARD. In TBC there were good tanks and noob tanks. But at least even with the noob tanks the DPS knew how to CC (depends on class obviously) or hold back their threat because it was common sense that if you pull aggro your going to die. Even in Wotlk damage isnt that bad if DPS pulls. DPS can usually live when pulling aggro. <br />
<br />
BUT, Blizz is the one who desensitized DPS players and told them to forget about CC spells and threat altogether and to just sit in one spot and AOE.This created a rift between good dps and bad, teaching them to ignore CC and their threat. Sure, better DPS players can inch out some better damage than the noobs who AOE everything, and the DPS players who were around in TBC have common sense about this. The problem is new players who joined Wotlk or players from TBC who werent that good to begin with and forgot all the skills DPS classes.<br />
<br />
Now Blizz is expecting players to relearn how to CC or how Threat even fucking works. This is the reason Cat will have a record low amount of Tanks and Heals. Its not about bad players, its about decent ones not interested in babysitting DPS in Cat.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Stop blaming Tanks and Heals, expecting all of them to be &quot;uber.&quot; Be happy players even want to play those rolls. This is Blizzards fault not the community of players.</div></div><hr />

Probably, when the other classes get to save more than 2 specs, you are gonna get more than 5 pets with saved specs.<br />

<br />
They totally re vamp the pet talents giving each one improved utility so us Hunters have a wider choice of way to benefit the raid or ourselves, only to have the talents wiped whenever we Stable a pet?!<br />
Sense...it makes non.<br />
<br />
you can store 5 pets to take with you and swap at anytime with the call pet ability and store and additional 20 pets in a stable (at an inn). the call pet ability swaps your 5 preset pets to use while in raids etc and wont have thier talents wiped while the stored pets in the stables will. in all seriousness, who need 20 pets though?</div></div><hr />

Don't try and download it from the battle.net page it'll only take you to the last patch.I had to click on the PTR realms button on the World of Warcraft main page and go from there .Also just click on that to copy toons when I clicked the copy toons on the side menu it took me to change realm page just click on the words Public Test Realm.</div></div><hr />

It's quite the contrary actually. You dont understand the concept of peer to peer i think. With p2p, the more people there is the faster is your download speed.<br />

Currently however, there's not much to do on the PTR. All you can really do right now is create a new character; copying a premade character or one of your own characters isn't even possible right now. Both the queues are full, and have an average wait time of over 5 days! Ouch!<br />
Anywho, I still already downloaded it, so I won't have to download as much when there's more stuff being placed in the PTR. Just got to wait until that happens, though. :p</div></div><hr />

Nah it's normal. WOTLK followed the same pattern. <br />
<br />
Wrath release date arrived September 15th 2008 after 3.0 hit PTR on September 13th 2008. <br />
<br />
So they may announce the release date this week if Blizzard follow the same schedule.</div></div><hr />

I think you don't understand the concept of how the internet, or even LAN connections work.<br />
<br />
When I download p2p, my downloadspeed is capped to 300k from blizz, when I download HTTP, I get over 3 MB/sec.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
I have 30 MBit download, but my upload is only 1 MBit, which is crappy.<br />
<br />
So when I'm using p2p, my upload is full, ~120 kb/sec.<br />
<br />
The thing is, to download, you need a certain amount of upload available, to confirm the packets you receive. This means that a capped upload also severely limits your download, a problem very much present when using p2p.</div></div><hr />

I had the same problem with the installer. Open up Task Manager and end the process for WoWinstaller.exe or whatever it is named, then navigate back to the downloaded .exe and restart it, should go ok again :)<br />
<br />
Also don't worry about if it seems to stop on 4%, it's still running, but the bar just freezes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm aware of this. I'm just trying to get my head around why Blizzard would wipe the talents when you stable a pet. It's annoying more than a hindrance. Having to re spec your pet if you want to use say more than 5.</div></div><hr />

You can have 20 pets, whose buffs are the same as those of actual players, as well as a plethora of unique, high-detail pets/skins to choose from(in cata at least), so you must forgive me, as a warlock, who have less than 10 demons to choose from, all of which are badly in need of new skins, if I can't take your hunter QQ that seriously :):)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Real player buffs? Oh, you mean the buffs Imps and Felhunters provide, which are also &quot;real player&quot; buffs, not to mention Demonology's pet-related buff, which only one spec (Enh Shamans) can bring? The deacent buffs are all tied to BM spec (which is considerably lower DPS in testing on beta than the other specs right now).<br />
<br />
Then, I mean, you only have have demons which have a bunch of powerful abilities, which Hunter pets get absolutely nothing like (let's see, we have: only very weak AoE for a non-DPS pets rather than a dedicated AoE pet, no dispels, no ranged attacks, no shields, no knockback, no true CC, a 3 second temporary taunt on a 3 minute cooldown for tank pets rather than VW's 10 second cooldown TRUE taunt...could go on for a while!).<br />
<br />
Then there's the problem of Hunters being utterly broken for balance, designed with a bunch of very nasty flaws according to Blizz's own posts (i.e. being permanently cast/GCD locked), bringing very little utility, don't change their rotation for movement...)<br />
<br />
And you're hung up on a few cosmetic skins? Erm...</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, if you get too far away from the Dark Portal or outside of a capital city, it dismounts you. This can be fatal.<br />
<br />
However...<br />
<br />
...it does not de-shapeshift druids in Swift Flight Form. (I've been unable to test normal Flight Form since I don't have a druid without Swift Flight Form trained and I don't think I can create and level a new one to 60 before they patch this bug.)<br />
<br />
I was able to get all the way from the Dark Portal to Blackrock Mountain (trying the same trip on a Black Drake for an ironic screenshot was what led me to discover the fatal-dismount field outside the Dark Portal and Undercity) and from Thunder Bluff to Hyjal--where the No Man's Land debuff is still in effect, I got ported to Darkwhisper Gorge. Finished up by getting a nice screenshot of dancing with the Shatterspear Trolls while under the Darkspear Warrior transformation, and made a few new night elf hunters laugh over near Aldrassil. (Teldrassil, by the way, is still incredibly huge. Being able to finally grasp its entire size at once has not decreased its awesomeness for me.)<br />
<br />
So if you've got a druid, take the chance! There'll be no more opportunities to see glitchy areas and bad texture edges after Deathwing destroys... them... hmmm, maybe he's not such a bad dude after all...<br />

If I understand you correctly, you mean the installer.exe when you first downloaded the initial setup file (around 100MB) of the PTR?<br />
If so, you should just start the launcher.exe and it will continue to download the rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've leveled a goblin warlock through the starter islands recently. The Felguard is absolutely terrible. It has so little health that the max number of hits it can take before dying is three (in my experience), and it doesn't really hit hard enough to justify the quick death. I very much recommend with sticking to the imp until level 20 at the earliest.<br />

we're basically testing what SHOULD have already been well and truly tested in the cata beta (don't they trust those testers).<br />
<br />
just move it to live, if it's on the PTR for longer than a week.. i mean, that'll just be stupid.<br />
<br />
i doubt blizz wants to stress test, there's nothing to stress test (except maybe the launcher)... nothings changed. It's just the UI and new spells (which HAVE already been tested).<br />
<br />
idiotacy. testing what has already been tested and been tested by the blizzard guys. <br />

Because this feedback is pointless, the most you can test is the launcher, that is it. The stuff your downloading is not anything worth testing. The talents and abilities are made for 85, your only 80 on there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Beta testers started beta testing with the new world (1-60 zones).<br />
<br />
At some point on the PTR, they are going to start rolling out the pre-cata events where bad things start happening. Then they are going to bring down the PTR and test the transition to the new 1-60 zone. You know, important things like &quot;what the hell will happen to may character if I log out in an area that is suddenly a volcano&quot;, &quot;what happens if my hearthstone is set to Camp Tajura which doesn't exist anymore&quot; etc.<br />
<br />
Those things were never tested on the beta servers because the beta servers never had the 'old world'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like you're doing it from the battle.net page! You need to go to whichever version(s) website you have and actually click on the PTR button in the navigation bar, enter in your information &amp; click download for PC. Should be the right patch at that point.</div></div><hr />

DBW and Sharpend Twilight Scale now has Crit instead of Arp.<br />

On other gear Arp seem to have been replaced with Crit OR Haste. Bit random there is my impression</div></div><hr />
