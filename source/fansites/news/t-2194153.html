Rogue Class Fantasy Insight and Upcoming Changes<br />
Legion came with a tremendous amount of class changes, and Rogues were a big part of this. We've been making adjustments/improvements to many specs since Legion has launched, and that will continue, especially for Rogues in the near future. Let's talk Rogue fantasy and mechanics a bit.<br />
<br />
Assassination<br />
Assassination has always had the Poison theme, but we think Bleeds pair well with Poisons here, both fantasy-wise and mechanically. The idea that you can apply a slew of Poison and Bleed damage over times to the target, dooming your enemy to certain death is one of our core fantasies for Assassination. At this point Assassination is clearly less of a &quot;get in, kill, and get out&quot; spec - that distinction is now more on Subtlety.<br />
<br />
Agree that the balance of Bleeds vs. Poisons might be a little heavy on the Bleeds side currently on the baseline spec. That wasn't really super intentional. Assassination got Mutilate, Envenom, Rupture, and Garrote (probably the most obvious choices for a baseline rotation) after we divided up many of the Rogue skills between specs in 7.0. So the spec essentially already started a little Bleed-heavy. Add on top of that Blood of the Assassinated (which is fairly strong and everyone has) and Exsanguinate (which was overtuned at launch), both of which prop up bleeds more.<br />
<br />
We like that the Assassination talent tree has two thematic paths - Poison (Master Poisoner + Agonizing Poison) and Bleed (Hemorrhage + Exsanguinate). But we lean on our talent trees to do so much more than just let you choose between 2 thematic paths for your spec fantasy - they have to offer simple passives vs. added complexity via new buttons, single target vs. AOE mechanics, playstyle/pacing customization, and more. And of course, all of this is extremely sensitive to the tuning and design of talents, set bonuses, legendaries, and artifact traits. Any one of these variables could be newly introduced or overtuned/undertuned and easily push Assassination down either the Poison or Bleeds talent path, essentially against your will if you like one theme over the other but want to maximize damage. For example, at Legion launch, Hemo + Exsan was the standard build, and now it's switched over to Master Poisoner + Agonizing. Tier 19 pushes Poison damage a bit via Envenom, but Tier 20 might push Bleed damage a bit via Garrote (note: T20 designs are still in flux, many are likely to change). We want to make both paths viable, but should be realistic and recognize that many variables can and will affect this, and that the balance will fluctuate over time.<br />
<br />
On a couple talents:<br />
<br />
Agonizing Poison (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/200802): We don't really like Agonizing Poison for many reasons. It replaces Deadly Poison (which feels core to Assassination Rogue) with an extremely passive, mostly invisible, and currently very strong Poison debuff that makes target-swapping and AOE more difficult. It's got a lot of things going wrong with it and is on the chopping block for the next patch. Ideas for replacements include a short-cooldown AOE Poison damage button that costs high energy or something that deals Poison damage in a rotationally-interesting way.<br />
Exsanguinate (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/200806): This is a good talent. It has a clear theme with interesting mechanical and rotational implications. We'll look at tuning based on what happens with Agonizing Poison, but plans are to buff its damage and add a small energy cost, not because of tuning but because on-GCD buttons that don't cost Energy sometimes lead to Energy-capping, which doesn't feel good.<br />
<br />
Overall we think the single-target Assassination rotation is in a good place. There are nuances to applying and maintaining your bleeds with maximizing Envenom uptime being an underlying core part of the rotation, as it has been for a long time.<br />
<br />
Outlaw<br />
The pirate theme is clear, and clearly contentious. I think it would be accurate to say there are many players who like the fantasy of the spec and many who don't. As a class with 3 specs of the same role, this is probably an okay place to be in.<br />
<br />
We have a couple major mechanical goals for Outlaw in the next patch:<br />
<br />
<br />
Rebalance Roll the Bones (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/193316-roll-the-bones): This is a two-parter.<br />
<br />
The first part is tuning each of the single-buffs against each other, narrowing the gap in power level between any two single-buffs. You should see this when the next patch hits PTR. <br />
<br />
The second part is more complex - we're considering removing the incentive to reroll almost entirely and re-acclimating everyone to getting 1 buff from RTB most of the time and not rerolling. The main problem involves ensuring the average expected value of casting Roll the Bones is close enough to 1.0 buffs that it's not better to reroll. With either the current 6-dice or an alternate 5-dice natural system, the probabilities are such that it's too lucrative to reroll when you get a single-buff right now. <br />
<br />
The current proposal is to reduce the number of dice being rolled from 6 to 5 and to hand-set probabilities to something like 79% chance for 1-buff, 20% chance for 2-buffs, and 1% chance for 5-buffs (yahtzee), bringing the expected value of a roll down to 1.24 buffs (plus additional value for synergies between buffs). The downside to this is that if you take a deep look at the probability distribution, in order for this to work, you realize that the dice would have to be loaded against the player. This isn't something we'd prefer to do (adjust randomness against the player's favor), but it might be something we have to do with the current Roll the Bones dice system in order to remove the incentive to reroll. <br />
<br />
Overall we want to reduce how much the spec is defined by Roll the Bones. RTB can be most of the time a single buff that might change your pacing or rotation slightly with relatively rare bonuses of 2-buffs or 5-buffs, but that the spec should completely work both mechanically and damage-wise without RTB, if you want to take Slice and Dice as a replacement.<br />
<br />
Smooth out Energy Generation: Outlaw suffers a bit rotationally from unpredictable Energy generation and Energy-flooding during Adrenaline Rush. The changes we're doing here are pretty simple and direct but should help to alleviate this issue - Adrenaline Rush reduced Energy regen increase but increased duration and Combat Potency procs twice as often for half the Energy each proc.<br />
<br />
Subtlety<br />
Subtlety in the long-term it has some room for improvements. For the next patch the first things we're looking at are:<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow Dance (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/185313-shadow-dance): Shadow Dances happen a lot more than they used to and in PvE, that's been mostly a welcome change. The rotation is more dynamic than it used to be in previous expansions, with you going in and out of Shadow Dance more often. However, set bonuses, artifact traits, and legendaries frequently grant resources (to any spec) as their bonus (because it's mechanically interesting), and in the case of Subtlety, increased Energy/Combo Points has pushed Shadow Dance uptime to be higher than we think is good for the spec. <br />
<br />
Additionally, from both PvE and PvP Subtlety Rogues, we've heard that the spec's feeling of burstiness has been severely reduced, partially as a result of Shadow Dances happening more frequently. We'd like to address this in the next patch with a couple changes. First, Deepening Shadows will be reduced from 3 to 1-1.5 sec of cooldown reduction per Combo Ppoint baseline. Shadow Dance baseline charges reduced from 3 to 2. New talents on the same row that compete against each other will either 1) increase Deepening Shadows back up to the current 3 sec or 2) grant you increased damage during Shadow Dance. This lets you customize your Shadow Dance to happen more often, or be most bursty when it does happen. As usual, we'll retune the damage of the spec alongside these changes, but the first focus should be on changes to pacing and mechanics.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nightblade (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/195452-nightblade): On single-target, Nightblade works okay mechanically as a damage button that you press occasionally, but it doesn't really play as we'd like in AOE situations. The AOE rotation of Shuriken Storm-&gt;Nightblade everything isn't what we feel Subtlety should be about, on top of being basically identical to the Assassination AOE rotation. A direction we'd like to go is - Subtlety deals increased damage in AOE by dealing massively increased damage to a single target. In this vein, we're considering a new baseline passive that does something like &quot;Each enemy hit by Shuriken Storm increases the damage of your next Eviscerate by ~25%, up to a max of ~5 stacks&quot;, which would push Nightblade completely out of the AOE rotation on 4+ targets.<br />
<br />
Separately but related, we don't think Nightblade is a perfect fit for the Subtlety fantasy. On top of being a core rotational damage over time ability on a &quot;get in and get out/bursty&quot; Rogue spec, it's also the passive snare on the spec, which we think could be delivered more simply by re-adding Crippling Poison back to the spec at some point in the future. Tying Subtlety Rogue's snare to a shadow-themed DoT was clearly an attempt at further separating Subtlety vs. Assassination as Shadow vs. Poison, but in hindsight might have been overkill, and it probably wouldn't hurt Subtlety's fantasy that much to have utility poisons back, if we don't find a better fantasy+mechanical alternative for the spec. Don't have concrete long-term plans on this specific subtopic, but it's on our minds.<br />
<br />
As an aside on the topic of adding back spells - after doing a lot of class fantasy-focusing and spell pruning in Legion 7.0 (which had many successes as well as failures), we've been adding back some spells to specs (though we do have some strict requirements here) which in hindsight didn't need to be removed. Good examples for Rogue are Blind (which we removed from Assassination) and Shroud of Concealment (which we removed from all Rogue specs), both of which we have since added back. The removal of Blind from Assassination made the spec a little too one-dimensional on the crowd-control front and the removal of Shroud of Concealment cost the class a interesting button that provided rare moments of coolness, without any rotational complexity or huge downsides aside from being an additional button.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowstrike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/185438-shadowstrike): In the PvE rotation, Shadowstrike coming with a 15 yd teleport is mostly unnecessary, and also sometimes causes usability issues as an uncontrolled teleport on your core rotation. You might be in melee range, and suddenly the boss moves and rotates a bit, and suddenly you Shadowstrike teleport into a spot you don't want to be in.<br />
<br />
What we want to do here is add Ambush back to the spec as the replacement in the core rotation for Shadowstrike, and move Shadowstrike to a 30 second cooldown and back up to 25 yd range. Shadowstrike would become the second gap closer for Subtlety, different from Shadowstep in that it's essentially Shadowstep + Ambush in one button. On the table are alternatives like removing Shadowstrike entirely and giving Shadowstep reduced cooldown or 2 charges, but we currently feel Shadowstrike is cool enough of a button and high enough on the usability meter that it deserves a spot on the spec. We'd probably keep the damage, cost, and stealth requirement of Ambush and Shadowstrike identical in all cases to make Shadowstrike's only benefit over Ambush being the teleport.<br />
<br />
When it comes to class/spec fantasy - players (including us) have many differing ideas. Even in this thread there are completely different thoughts and interpretations on what Rogue fantasy should be for each of the 3 specs. It's really hard to completely satisfy everyone. Our ongoing goal is to deliver distinct spec fantasies and playstyles that appeal to enough players and are fun enough to deserve a spot as one of the class's specs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Overall Item Level<br />
The overall item level does indeed no longer take into consideration any extra Legendaries you have. This is intended (and was something we saw a lot of requests for on the forums) to give a more accurate assessment of a player’s maximum item level, since they cannot equip more than two legendaries anyway. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1054620-overall-ilvl-decrease/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17615301924?page=1#11))<br />
<br />
Honor Changes in Patch 7.2<br />
As mentioned earlier in the thread, the amount of Honor required to level from Honor level 1-50 during Prestige 0 was cut in half in 7.2. Previous to 7.2, the amount of Honor required to level through Honor levels 1-10 was a very small number, so that characters would earn at least 1 Honor Talent in each tier very quickly.<br />
<br />
Now that you no longer lose access to Honor Talents when you Prestige, the amount of Honor required for each level AFTER reaching Prestige 1 has been smoothed out. The total amount of Honor required for each Prestige level after Prestige 0 has been slightly reduced, not increased.<br />
<br />
We also added the Enlistment Bonus in 7.2, which grants 50% additional Honor to the faction that needs more players in queue for battlegrounds. This is also granted to players who take advantage of our mercenary system and queue as the faction that needs more players. As a reminder, the battleground recruiters that enable mercenary mode are located in the Dalaran Sewers, at The Underbelly Descent.

The problem with vanilla though was that it had literally the worst class balance this game has ever had. Prot warrior was basically the only tank, with Bear being used in some parts, leaving Prot paladins as a joke. Any hybrid class had one viable spec which was usually the healing one, and if you did want to play something like a Ret paladin, your rotation was as basic a rotation as it gets (seal, judgement, repeat). You had a lot of spliting up of specs in PVE viable ones and PVP, which sounds cool, but limits your choices in what you can/want to play (for example, Arms was the PVP spec, and Fury was the PVE spec for DPS as a warrior). If the choice is Vanilla where specs get either pigeon-holed into a certain end-game type, or the spec is just not good at anything versus Legion where, sure the 'mystic and feel' of the specs may not be what you want, but atleast you can play whatever you want, the choice seems fairly obvious.</div></div><hr />

But they do these radical changes every expansion it really sucks.<br />
<br />
You mean the Vanilla where we had class-specific patches because retail release had them basically unfinished? I don't think class design came into its own until WLK, before then you still had classes who's entire rotation could be one spell or specs that just weren't viable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of the Sub issues were addressed in feedback back in Alpha and Beta for 7.0; yet they blatantly ignored everything brought up; and the only response we got was Celestalon stating that ShadowDance not activating the Stealth bar was a fantastic idea they're sticking with( that turned out well ).<br />
<br />
They also stated they'd never change mechanics and major gameplay during the expansion; and yet here we are.<br />
<br />
Most of what I'm reading about Sub looks like they're going to gut it even more; unless they plan on drastically buffing it's damage outside of ShadowDance.<br />
Let's face it, outside of ShD we're useless limp noodles, Backstab and Gloomdblade are useless.<br />
Or we end up with WoD Sub; great in raids; useless in every other PvE aspect; forcing you to play an offspec for all that content. That's sure going to go well with the current Artifact and Legendary system.<br />
<br />
Why not fix Shadowstrike if it needs to be fixed, (I have no issue with it) instead of adding in more button bloat. Another thing they stated they don't want.<br />
<br />
Ambush + Shadowstrike + Shadowstep seems pointless. Only two are needed at most, and I can't see why they suddenly want Ambush back after they just said it'll do the same damage, cost the same energy, and have the same cooldown; just no teleport. ( Just the remove the TP from Shadowstrike if that's the main issue. )<br />
<br />
What's this rubbish about adding poisons back now suddenly? So much for class fantasy eh? Just give us a proper snare/slow that's shadow themed; how darn hard is that?<br />
The main issue came from Nightblade counting as normal magic damage, which could be removed; and it's snare dispelled. That's easy to address without adding poisons.<br />
<br />
I don't see the issue with Nightblade, it's not been my main DPS output since early Emerald Nightmare really; although I like the idea of buffing out Evis damage through Shuriken Storm.<br />
<br />
What about Symbols of Crap? It's a boring button pressed every once in awhile that adds nothing really to the gameplay. So much so the entire next Tier set revolves around making it less of a pain.<br />
<br />
They have a lot to do to balance and make the spec better; instead of trying to funnel people in Assa.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't see them pulling off what they want successfully. The entire bluepost is full of &quot;If, buts, and maybes&quot;. They don't even know what they want, and the entire Subtlety post reads as if it's from an early Alpha build; where they're trying to figure out what they want to do with the spec.</div></div><hr />

They don't know anything about the game, about the class, the fantasy behind it. They just do what they think &quot;could&quot; work, at least in their heads, which mostly doesn't. WoW was never in such a bad state as it is right now. They don't only nerf.... they f*ck class in the ass every single patch...<br />
You love ability XY?? Yes?? Sorry... we removed it.... OR sorry... had to nerf it, we couldnt see that is an uber tool or does too much damage....<br />
Seriously... they change classes on a daily base, like the legendary crap item. Its really a pain in the *ss. They are really amateurs. This game is still in alpha.</div></div><hr />

They'll nerf ShadowDance because they can. They'll also increase the damage for about a week, then nerf that into the ground because reasons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LevelTen</div><div class="date">2017-03-31, 01:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard used to have a rule about not changing classes mid expansion. Never has an expansion needed that rule more than Legion. In Legion we are locked into one spec more than ever. It contains all of our hard earned AP, it has several legendaries supporting it, earned over months of playing. We all had a chance to choose what we wanted to play at the beginning, hopefully most players picked something they enjoyed or at the minimum tolerate. It happened to me with MM. I'm one of the hunters that enjoyed the cyclical rotation of the sidewinder's spec. It's what I tried and signed up for when legion began. Mid-expansion they change it into something I do not like a much more spammier rotation. My opinion of course, but you can't just pull the rug out from under us like that this expansion, it's way to hard to re-roll to an alt or even change specs in this expansion. Leave the classes alone till next expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lolwat.<br />
<br />
Ya, sure, they were fine back then. Half (actually, probably two-thirds) of the specs weren't viable in the slightest. Hunters auto-attacked, and maybe used Arcane Shot if they felt like not being lazy (at least, until they ran out of mana). Ret paladins auto-attacked, judged every 10 seconds, and used a seal every 30 seconds (and then had to individually cast a buff on every single one of their 40 raid members every 5 minutes). Destro locks pretty much just spammed Shadowbolt until they pulled aggro and died. Mages couldn't even use their best spec because everything was immune to fire damage, so they were stuck spamming Frostbolt ad nauseum. PvP was literally warriors, rogues, and 2m mages, and everyone else was just free HKs.<br />
<br />
Vanilla was atrocious compared to more recent expansions, when it comes to class design. Most of the classes and specs didn't start becoming decent until Wrath or later.</div></div><hr />

Are you serious? Half of the specs being unusable, the other half being one or two button rotations? Is this your notion of fun? O_o</div></div><hr />

They failed with Diablo 3 and it took senior members coming in and demanding changes were made to right that ship, and here they are again doing the exact same things with WoW. And to add insult to injury they refuse to accept the fact that the way MMO's in general and WoW specifically play is diametrically opposed to the Diablo loot pinata playstyle. They've taken this setting in genre, which was intended to be a living and breathing world customers could lose themselves in...and turned it into a series of broken and disjointed game systems which don't play well together, all on the basis of &quot;wouldn't it be cool if&quot;, and it's constantly reminding us players that it's exactly that, a broken game that no longer knows what it is or wants to be.<br />
<br />
I know I'll probably get hammered for demanding people be fired for this mess, because there are always bleeding hearts that believe incompetence should be rewarded and everyone gets their trophy...but this is the real world and Overwatch isn't going to sustain Blizzard like WoW has. This will have a real effect on their bottom line in the long run.</div></div><hr />
