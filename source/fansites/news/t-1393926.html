<br />
The Recruit A Friend program (http://www.battle.net/wow/shop/recruit-a-friend/) is back and better than ever! Now you can choose from 8 different mount and pet rewards—including the brand-new Emerald Hippogryph—and enjoy leveling benefits all the way to level 85.<br />
<br />
The upgraded Recruit A Friend allows you to email friends and family members Starter Edition activation keys for World of Warcraft from directly within the game. To get started, simply open up your in-game Friends List and click the new Recruit A Friend button.<br />
<br />
A Treasure Trove of Rewards <br />
Similar to the old system, after a recruited friend purchases 1 month of World of Warcraft game time, the veteran player (aka the recruiter) will get 1 month of free World of Warcraft game time. In addition, approximately one week after a recruit successfully purchases two months of game time, the veteran player will be able to select one of the following epic pet and mount rewards to permanently add to their collection. Recruit enough friends, and you’ll eventually be able to snag them all:<br />

​In-Game Benefits<br />
To help you and your recruit take on the challenges of Azeroth together, players who participate in the Recruit A Friend program will enjoy the following in-game benefits for up to 90 days:<br />
<br />
<br />
Recruit and veteran characters can summon one another to each other's locations.<br />
While adventuring with your linked friend or family member, you will each gain triple experience while partied up to level 85, as long as your characters are within 4 levels of each other.<br />
For every two levels the recruit's characters earn, one grantable level is gained. Recruit characters may then grant these levels to the veteran player's character as long as the character is lower in level than the level-granting character.<br />

FAQ<br />
<br />
Q: I sent a request to a friend but they didn’t get it—what now?<br />
A: You can attempt to send another one. Ensure you have their correct email address, and let your friend know to check their Spam/Junk mail folders, as their email service could be filtering the invitation.<br />
<br />
Q: How long are Recruit A Friend invitations valid?<br />
A: Recruit A Friend invitations are valid for 7 days. If you haven’t received a response from your friend within that time, you’ll need to send another invitation.<br />
<br />
Q: My friend just started playing. Can I still recruit them even if they already made an account?<br />
A: Yes, with the new system you can recruit players who have World of Warcraft accounts that are less than 30 days old. Simply use the standard Recruit A Friend process. When your friend receives the email, clicking the link will bind your accounts for Recruit A Friend rewards and benefits (as long as the potential recruit’s account is still 30 days old or less).<br />
<br />
Q: I’ve recruited someone already—can I do it again?<br />
A: Yes! You can recruit as many people as you like, and with the new reward system you’ll have a variety of mount and pet rewards to choose from when each of your recruited friends purchases two months of game time.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I get every Recruit A Friend pet and mount?<br />
A: Yes. If enough friends accept the Recruit A Friend request from you and pay for two months of game time, you’ll be able to receive all of the rewards.<br />
<br />
Q: I received a Recruit A Friend reward from the old system, but didn’t claim it. Will it still work?<br />
A: Yes. You will receive a credit for the old mount reward if you didn’t redeem it.<br />
<br />
Q: I sent or received a Recruit A Friend request invitation from the previous system, but it hasn’t been accepted yet. Is it still good?<br />
A: No, you’ll need to send or receive a new invitation through the updated Recruit A Friend system.<br />

Firstly, let me get the obvious joke out of the way:<br />
&quot;Makes me wish I had a friend...&quot;<br />
<br />
But to be serious - I hate to be &quot;that guy&quot;, but this is going to be mostly used by people that buy a new account + game time to get the mounts for their main... I've had several friends start playing WoW, while I was playing, but all but one started without even knowing about any recruit-a-friend and only told me afterwards, which was late for &quot;recruiting them&quot;, even if I was the one who persuaded them to start playing. And, ironically, the only one that I did recruit (and that was because we were playing in the same room when he started), started way before recruit-a-friend gave even the Zhevra mount, so I only got 1 month of game time out of him (on the other hand, of course, having a good friend play a game with you is much better than any mount, so I'm not complaining :-) )</div></div><hr />

Just waiting for Gamestop's Black Friday sale when I can get all of WoW for $15.

May be difficult to find a server that fulfills my requirements, but thought I'd let you all know my plans. I am a US player too if that makes a difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For every two levels the recruit's characters earn, one grantable level is gained. Recruit characters may then grant these levels to the veteran player's character as long as the character is lower in level than the level-granting character.<br />

But the email says<br />

For every two levels of experience you earn, you can grant one level of experience to any one of your or &lt;name&gt; characters of a lower level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Dear Players,<br />
<br />
We have accepted the fact that this game has peaked, and we're not expecting to gain many new subscribers.<br />
<br />
However, we realize that what is left of our dwindling fan base still contains a fair amount of people who will pay for pixels. And this RAF program enables us to boast about increased subscription levels, even though we don't really report on how many of these are actually new unique identities. Being great at business means not only fooling your customers, but also the shareholders.<br />
<br />
So by supporting us in this pay-for-pixels program, you will help us mislead everyone, increase our revenue and hide the fact that we're bleeding thousands of subscribers every day. Who cares about offering new content when we can focus our efforts into schemes like this to get you to pay more?!<br />
<br />
Now run along, little fanboys, run along.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
<br />
Blizzard Entertainment</div></div><hr />

You are still only getting half of the mount, same with the mounts on the store... take flying away from those mounts for a whole patch and there will be plenty of angry ripped off people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You probably got the extra reward because you didn't redeem one of your RaF rewards awhile back. You were able to store 1 reward for when they changed the program if you wanted since there was no reason to have multiples of the same mounts.<br />
<br />
I had done it twice while the Nightwing mount was active and now I can choose between any of the other 7 (since Nightwing is now greyed out)</div></div><hr />

Same goes for shipping the authenticator. I had to have a friend send it from UK</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lucetia</div><div class="date">2013-11-12, 10:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So i have a question, i recruited a friend 2 months prior to the removal of the old system .. so i got the 1month of free game time, but 4 days before i was elegible for the mount, they removed the program.<br />
<br />
Now when i follow the instructions to redeem the mount, it doesn't show there!<br />
<br />
No, they have to buy 2 months regardless while the program is active. If it's not shown there then the activations were not done in the appropriate time frames.<br />
<br />

Hey everyone needing a friend, I'll be starting a new account in a few weeks. Just waiting for Gamestop's Black Friday sale when I can get all of WoW for $15. Not sure which server I want to start on though, but one thing for sure it won't be PvP or RPPvP, and it must have names avail that I want to use.<br />
<br />
May be difficult to find a server that fulfills my requirements, but thought I'd let you all know my plans. I am a US player too if that makes a difference.<br />
<br />
Honestly I would just wait till the digital sale Blizzard does and grab the battle chest for $5 (and then pay for whatever MoP is). I know when the sale happens I'll probably buy 6 keys so I can raf later on and get the other rewards when I'm not too lazy and build up some alts on another server. Might even finish filling out my alliance roster.</div></div><hr />

Same happened to me! But in my defense i didnt receive a mount the last time i did RAF even though my friend had bought game time. So i chose the Hyppogryph!</div></div><hr />

Invite yourself, make use of the levelling perks. Needs a 3rd account with a tank to do it well tho (pull whole instance, kill at entrance). <br />
<br />
It costs as little as the battlechest (like £5 in the sales) and 1 60 day gamecard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I invite myself, buy the battle chest when there is a sale (5€) and then in addition I buy 2 months of game time via game time card (25€).<br />
I get one month free game time for my main account and a mount.<br />
<br />
That means, the mount effectively costs 5+25-13 = 17€?<br />
Or is it tied into buying all xpacs up to mists?</div></div><hr />

Well they could of just put it on the store for $25 I'm sure everyone would still buy them just look at all the other stuff but that would be too easy if you have to sub they might forget and keep the sub charging months = more money for blizz :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I had done it twice while the Nightwing mount was active and now I can choose between any of the other 7 (since Nightwing is now greyed out)<br />
<br />
I didn't have any stored. I did it twice, I got Zhevra, then I got Rocket mount. To the other poster, it was just an icon on the BNET character tab and it was flashing I had an unclaimed reward.</div></div><hr />

I know two people that want to come back to WoW. They had accounts for years and have had them deactivated for over a year now. They should count towards being recruited.

Battlechest + two months of paid game time and then you pick your prize.</div></div><hr />

I really wish they would have at least change the colors on these new mounts or even the name, just a little to distinguish them.</div></div><hr />

Are the legacy mounts owners going to see some... payback?? or somthink like that?? <br />
Just to konw, I mean, i hope everyone could get every mount with some effort but this is just unfair, why some yes and some no??</div></div><hr />
