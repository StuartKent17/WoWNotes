The Alliance strikes at the heart of the Zandalari empire in the Battle of Dazar’alor, a new raid that provides both Horde and Alliance players with unique encounters for their faction—along with the opportunity to play through events from the opposite faction’s viewpoint. <br />
<br />
Battle of Dazar’alor<br />
For ages untold, Dazar’alor has stood at the center of the great and powerful Zandalari empire. Its guards have thwarted numerous attempts on King Rastakhan’s life, and it has endured trials both ancient and new. But as war reaches the shores of Zuldazar, the Alliance embarks on a daring gambit to besiege the golden pyramid and sever the Zandalari’s bond to the Horde.<br />

<br />
<br />
Horde players will begin the raid by defending against an invasion in the northern jungle of Zuldazar in the Defense of Dazar’alor.<br />
<br />
In the heart of Zuldazar the tables will turn, and Horde players will experience the story—and a trio of encounters—from the perspective of the Alliance. During this middle act, Death’s Bargain, Horde characters will transform into soldiers of the opposite faction (including their associated racials) based on their race:<br />
<br />
Blood Elf: Most blood elf players will transform into humans, while demon hunters will become night elves.<br />
Goblin: Goblin heroes will transform into gnomes, except for hunters and shaman, who will become dwarves.<br />
Orc: These players will transform to dwarves. (Talk about a shift in perspective.)<br />
Pandaren: Pandaren will stay as pandaren.<br />
Tauren: Most tauren will turn into draenei, while draenei druids will become night elves.<br />
Troll: Trolls will mostly transform into night elves; troll shaman will become draenei, and warlocks will become human.<br />
Undead: These players will transform into humans.<br />
<br />
Then, in the final act, Victory or Death, the Horde will once again play as themselves as they attempt to push the Alliance back from the High Seat—eventually confronting several key Alliance leaders.<br />
<br />
Defense of Dazar’alor: Champion of the Light; Grong, the Jungle Lord; Jadefire Masters<br />
The city faces a cowardly Alliance attack, and the Horde’s brave champions are the only ones who can break the siege.<br />
<br />
Champion of the Light<br />
As vanguard for the Alliance’s assault on Dazar’alor, Frida Ironbellows leads her troops with fervor and conviction. Her battle prowess and unwavering faith in the light make her a force to be reckoned with.<br />
<br />
Grong, the Jungle Lord<br />
After volunteering to become a living superweapon, the once intelligent Grong devolved into a giant rampaging behemoth. But through his mind may have deteriorated, Grong’s strength is more immense than it has ever been.<br />
<br />
Jadefire Masters<br />
Though they began training together only recently, Manceroy and Mestrah have perfected their teamwork and now present a united front. With both fire and fists, they stand ready to strike down any who challenge the Alliance.<br />
<br />
Death’s Bargain: Opulence, Conclave of the Chosen, King Rastakhan<br />
Witness King Rastakhan's defiant stand against the bloodthirsty Alliance invaders.<br />
<br />
Opulence<br />
Long ago, King Dazar had his golden treasury enchanted so that it would rise against anyone except its rightful owner. Many an unsuspecting thief has been slain by the very riches they coveted, serving as an important lesson to those who would steal from the throne.<br />
<br />
Conclave of the Chosen<br />
Deep within Dazar’alor lies a chamber built to honor six of Zandalar’s greatest loa, guarded by their most devout followers. Trespassers who dare enter this sacred hall are soon met with primal fury like none they have ever seen.<br />
<br />
King Rastakhan<br />
For over two hundred years, King Rastakhan has ruled the Zandalari empire. Since the Fall of Rezan, he has turned to a new patron—Bwonsamdi, the loa of death. The dark bargain he has made grants him the power to crush his enemies . . . but at what cost?<br />
<br />
Victory or Death: High Tinker Mekkatorque, Stormwall Blockade, Lady Jaina Proudmoore<br />
King Rastakhan has been slain, and those responsible must be brought to justice before they can escape.<br />
<br />
High Tinker Mekkatorque<br />
Unrivaled in their ingenuity, Gelbin Mekkatorque’s inventions have been instrumental to the Alliance’s attack on Dazar’alor. His state-of-the-art armor is outfitted with the latest—and deadliest—ordnance that gnomish engineering can offer.<br />
<br />
Stormwall Blockade<br />
Tidepriest Joseph and Tidepriestess Katherine are devout worshippers of the waves. These proud Kul Tirans would gladly risk their lives to ensure the safety of their compatriots. Their command over sea and storm is awesome to behold, as are the ancient and powerful rituals they practice.<br />
<br />
Lady Jaina Proudmoore<br />
As the Alliance fleet withdraws from Dazar’alor, Lady Jaina Proudmoore stays behind with a handful of Kul Tiran vessels to slow the Horde’s pursuit. Storm clouds gather overhead as Jaina leads her pursuers deeper into the Great Sea, where she will attempt to turn the odds in her favor.<br />
<br />

<br />
The Alliance is set to stage an attack on the heart of the Zandalari empire in a bid to sever the ties of the Zandalari and the Horde. They’ll begin with a naval strike on the docks of Dazar’alor in the Siege of Dazar’alor and push their way toward Rastakhan’s throne room in the heart of Dazar’alor in Empire’s Fall.<br />
<br />
To cap off the event, players will speak to a scout to shift to the Horde perspective and take on the final three Alliance bosses. During this final act, Might of the Alliance, Alliance characters will transform into soldiers of the opposite faction (including their associated racials) based on their race:<br />
<br />
Draenei: These players will transform into tauren, save for mages, who will become orcs.<br />
Dwarf: Most dwarves will turn into orcs; paladins will become tauren, priests will become undead.<br />
Gnome: These players will transform into goblins, except for monks, who will become blood elves.<br />
Human: Most humans will become undead, but paladins will become blood elves.<br />
Night Elf: Night elf players will transform into trolls, except for demon hunters, who will become blood elves.<br />
Pandaren: Pandaren will stay as pandaren.<br />
Worgen: All worgen players will transform into trolls.<br />
<br />
Siege of Dazar’alor: Champion of the Light; Jadefire Masters; Grong, the Revenant<br />
With the bulk of Rastakhan's forces lured into Nazmir, the time has come to storm the city.<br />
<br />
Champion of the Light<br />
Ra’wani and her troops are the first line of defense against the Alliance, sworn to lay down their lives for their city. Standing together, they empower and heal each other while fending off the incoming invaders.<br />
<br />
Jadefire Masters<br />
To the untrained eye, Ma’ra Grimfang and Anathos Firecaller may seem like a mismatched pair. The truth, however, is that their coordination is second to none. Their combined assault is powerful enough to level the most formidable foes.<br />
<br />
Grong, the Revenant<br />
Once willing to sacrifice everything to serve the Alliance, the mighty Grong has been raised form the dead and pitted against his former friends. Fighting on behalf of the Horde would be anathema to this noble soul, whose only hope for release is a clean death.<br />
<br />
Empire’s Fall: Opulence, Conclave of the Chosen, King Rastakhan<br />
Ancient treasures lie deep within the halls of the palace. But beware, for they are guarded by the wrath of the loa.<br />
<br />
Opulence<br />
Long ago, King Dazar had his golden treasury enchanted so that it would rise against anyone except its rightful owner. Many an unsuspecting thief has been slain by the very riches they coveted, serving as an important lesson to those who would steal from the throne.<br />
<br />
Conclave of the Chosen<br />

<br />
Might of the Alliance: High Tinker Mekkatorque, Stormwall Blockade, Lady Jaina Proudmoore<br />
Witness the Horde's savagery as they strike at the valiant heroes of the Alliance.<br />
<br />
High Tinker Mekkatorque<br />
Unrivaled in their ingenuity, Gelbin Mekkatorque’s inventions have been instrumental to the Alliance’s attack on Dazar’alor. His state-of-the-art armor is outfitted with the latest—and deadliest—ordnance that gnomish engineering can offer.<br />
<br />

Tidepriest Joseph and Tidepriestess Katherine are devout worshippers of the waves. These proud Kul Tirans would gladly risk their lives to ensure the safety of their compatriots. Their command over sea and storm is awesome to behold, as are the ancient and powerful rituals they practice.<br />

Which means this is once again a 100% Horde sided story. <br />
Yes, Rastakhan is an important lore figure....but guess what? Even if you count him as a &quot;Horde character&quot; - which is debatable - he would still be the only Horde leader not guilty of genocide. As an Alliance player, you have NO reason to hate Rastakhan or want to see him fall. None. It is a totally emotionless shitshow. If you only play Alliance you have not even fucking SEEN him one single fucking time this expansion. Why not let us fight somebody we actually hate? Like Nathanos, to give the most obvious example.<br />
<br />
It's totally in-line with the Darkshore Questline+Warfront, where Alliance are allowed to fight their own kind as endbosses, too.<br />
<br />
So much for &quot;Tides of Vengeance&quot;....it is obvious that Blizzard sacrificed a LOT of gameplay in this expansion to push through their vision of storytelling. If they keep it this one-sided they might just as well only make expansions for the Horde in the future.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
And no, i am not asking for the Alliance to KILL Nathanos. I'm fine if he is around a little longer to drag the Horde further into the mud. I would just like for Blizzard to give the Alliance opponents we actually have some reason to want to fight against. They have no problem doing this for the Horde.

If you look at the Bosses we were allowed to fight this expansion so far (even including faction-exclusive content) you should be able to agree that so far the Alliance did not get the chance to fight against a SINGLE opponent the story actually motivated us to want to fight.</div></div><hr />

That's because there are no more Horde characters. They've killed most of them.<br />
Nathanos and Sylvanas will probably die at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where did they say we would get it in December?<br />
<br />
Nighthold launched in January too. And Legion launched in August as well.<br />
<br />
It's the same content pacing they had in place for Legion.<br />
<br />
Also it's usually the pace between the opening raid and first big one now. Has been for years. You complain about pacing but raids have been paced like this if not slightly longer sometimes for years.</div></div><hr />

No we weren't, if you played the previous xpac then you would know that the patch would drop first and the raid would come later..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cracka_Bob</div><div class="date">2019-01-04, 01:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the purpose of storytelling, I like the whole &quot;temporarily switch to opposite faction&quot; thing. It allows them to create content that includes both factions, but only one point of view vs. content like ICC for example where we have 2 different points of view (oh no, the opposite faction is here with their gunship, shoot them down so we can continue).<br />
<br />
But at the same time, it's nice to have 2 points of view for a single story sometimes (Legion starting quests is a BIG example of this).

if you want to have 2 points of views wouldn't be better if you just play both factions ?<br />
because this raid the only thing that encourages is frustration for being forced to play the races of the enemy faction that you didn't chose.<br />

do you mean.. you are okay that blizzard goes with the unreliable narrator to tell the story? because that is an awful way of storytelling and force conflict.</div></div><hr />

At first i mark the “real day” that i suppose to login to play, but as time pass and as more trick they pull *warfront cough*<br />

So, wait, you're complaining that something you only do on one difficulty, a difficulty made for people who generally have no interest in raiding, comes out that late? Let's not pretend like if you were casual that the only reason you'd be playing is to do LFR. So yeah</div></div><hr />

It allows them to create content that includes both factions, but only one point of view vs. content like ICC for example where we have 2 different points of view (oh no, the opposite faction is here with their gunship, shoot them down so we can continue).<br />
<br />
But at the same time, it's nice to have 2 points of view for a single story sometimes (Legion starting quests is a BIG example of this). It creates a sense of &quot;we're the good guys, and they are the enemies because they did X&quot;. It leaves us questioning why the other faction would do such a thing (excluding those of us who play both sides lol) and encourages more of the &quot;war&quot; that they wanted with this expansion.<br />

Yeah Highmountain, Lightforged, Dark Iron and Mag'har should follow the related races (no idea about class/races combinations though). Void Elves shall transform into Blood Elves, would make sense but why not confirming it ?<br />

<br />
seriusly some days the forums just surprise me<br />
<br />
Edit. for the ppl that have issues reading or looking for anything blizzard post of the past 2 months.<br />
<br />
Since horde and alliance have diferents starting bosses on this raid, and some are faction related like Rastakan fight for alliance the oposite faction at the end will do those faction bosses transforming into the oposite faction, after a NPC tells u a story about what happen. <br />
So both faction can experience the full story of the raid. <br />
<br />
Same mechanic they did on BC for caver of time.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe the CoT stuff in the past changed your racial. Seems they are doing this to combat the &quot;Horde have better racials&quot; claim. If alliance guilds start doing better with horde racials, or if horde does worse with alliance racials, they might make updates.<br />

Ah yes, the good ol' Horde bias where they get a city raided, an important NPC murdered, the Golden Fleet destroyed and where the Alliance leaders don't die<br />
<br />
It is a shame there don't seem to be any forums left that moderate out people claiming things as dumb as Horde bias in a raid like this.</div></div><hr />

What defence?<br />
<br />
grexly75 is right. This release time lines up with Nightholds.<br />
<br />
And pretty much other entry raid to major raid patches. Hell beats a few of the older ones by a month or two. You are getting raids quicker than you used to.<br />
<br />
Also this has been a thing since at least Mists of Pandaria.<br />

<br />
Nighthold launched in January too. And Legion launched in August as well.<br />
<br />
It's the same content pacing they had in place for Legion.<br />
<br />
Also it's usually the pace between the opening raid and first big one now. Has been for years. You complain about pacing but raids have been paced like this if not slightly longer sometimes for years.<br />

Everyone forgets that Legion by this time also added in Trial of Valor (a 3 boss Raid) and Return to Karazhan (8 - 9 boss dungeon w/ a challenge run). Hell, that was added in late October 2016.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is pretty much how I initially read this to be, until today.<br />
Seems like instead of making a different story/raid for both factions, they decided they couldn't so just shoved it into one with a race swap in between :(</div></div><hr />

Because it is a pretty lazy way of dealing with it. <br />
<br />
It's literally just a simple race flip that's used in other instances. Or with toys.<br />
<br />
Maybe the raid is awesome don't get me wrong. But how they are handling the perspective is absolutely lazy and shoddy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Made up excuse: Dazar'alor doesn't remotely come close to Orgrimmar in terms of visuals and aesthetics, and I haven't mentioned the bossfights. Also technically it's not a Horde Capital... but that the least relevant thing, I know.<br />
<br />
2. As a Horde I didn't find him particularly interesting? I'd be interested to hear what depth of his character you found intriguing.<br />
<br />
3. She is? But opinions.. just alone the fact that she is one of the few heroes whom you would not expect to fight at all makes it somehow interesting.<br />
<br />
&quot;How is it fun to fight a final boss of a raid, only to have her teleport away at 1% so that you have accomplished next to nothing?&quot; Yes, cause most raiders play the raid for lore-reason, totally not to have fun by overcoming different challenges with teamwork. I mean, why should we really care about, if the &quot;teleports away at 1%&quot; still means: the boss is defeated.<br />
<br />
4. Should they dare to make the raid fundamentally different, the negative backlash would be overwhelming from both sides. It would be the perfect soil to continue bashing the developers with *insert your own faction here*-biased claims.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do u understand this cant never happen right?? there is multiple factor that prevent this.<br />
<br />
First there is competition for World first, that mean if one raid is easier that the other will make a huge problem. <br />
<br />
Second if the raid where the same, that mean basically we will get copy paste bosses with diferents skins. <br />
<br />
Third you split your audience alot more, since Raid been something that both faction can experience, with your approach it mean you need to have a horde or alliance alt to check the other side. <br />
<br />
This approach that Blizzard is taking make good sense, not to speak they announce this since day one. They said that no meter your faction you will be able to experience the other side. <br />
<br />
If ppl dont care to read the info or listen to the interviews from blizzcon is thier own fault.<br />

good lord, did any of you that pop up on a website dedicate to wowfans, care to actually read anything about the raid????<br />
<br />
you dont face your leader as your faction, after killing Rastakan and retreating from the city since horde reinforcement arrive. A Npc tell you why your fleet need to retreat and then you will get transform into horde and fight the alliance bosses.<br />
<br />
Similar is the experience for the horde, when they finish Jaina they find Rastakan is death, and a NPC tell the story (mean you fight the horde bosses)<br />

Sorry for the misunderstanding!

It would be the same raid but with a different order.

Doing them in a different order probably would have messed with their new &quot;leaderboards&quot; so it would have never flown, though it is an interesting thought.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually leader boards is why it would have worked and why I thought it was a done deal. Leaderboards make it so each faction guild is segregated to compete with each other rather than with the other faction. Say maybe Alliance got a world first because their order was faster, but it would be an Alliance world first as per the leaderboards, Horde race would still be going. Same happened with Uldir, Horde leaderboards were full but Alliance race was still going. Alas.</div></div><hr />

You want to beat up a Horde leader? Go back and play MoP. &quot;Oh woe is me, one of my racial leaders is a raid boss for ONE raid!&quot;. Try having your Faction leader be the bad guy for an entire xpac. And then a few years later have it happen again!</div></div><hr />

I just think they could have done better than the &quot;faction swap&quot;. It's just what they do with certain dungeons/events and it's not innovative whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Hell drop a boss and make the last 2 faction specific bosses or something. World First hasn't meant squat in WoW for years. Or hell maybe someone other than Method could have had a shot at it.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter if my toon gets transformed into a Horde toon, it's you who doesn't seem to understand. And how is Rastakan even equally Horde as Jaina and Meqatorque are Alliance? Answer: he isn't. He's a nobody in the Horde. <br />
<br />
So Alliance gets to beat up their own leaders while Horde gets to beat up Alliance leaders, too. <br />

In case you did not notice we like storm into Zandalari capital, kill their king and strawberry Horde big time. They get to have some scraps and barely that at that, because no big names on Alliance side die aside from one who will probably become some cyborg or whatever as a path to Tinkers.</div></div><hr />

Uldir was alright but imo like every entry raid recently more bad than good.<br />
<br />
Highmaul still remains the worst entry raid imo. Only good fight in that was Imperator.</div></div><hr />

Yes, Rastakhan is an important lore figure....but guess what? Even if you count him as a &quot;Horde character&quot; - which is debatable - he would still be the only Horde leader not guilty of genocide. As an Alliance player, you have NO reason to hate Rastakhan or want to see him fall. None. It is a totally emotionless shitshow. If you only play Alliance you have not even fucking SEEN him one single fucking time this expansion. Why not let us fight somebody we actually hate? Like Nathanos, to give the most obvious example.<br /> 
<br />
It's totally in-line with the Darkshore Questline+Warfront, where Alliance are allowed to fight their own kind as endbosses, too.<br />
<br />
So much for &quot;Tides of Vengeance&quot;....it is obvious that Blizzard sacrificed a LOT of gameplay in this expansion to push through their vision of storytelling. If they keep it this one-sided they might just as well only make expansions for the Horde in the future.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
And no, i am not asking for the Alliance to KILL Nathanos. I'm fine if he is around a little longer to drag the Horde further into the mud. I would just like for Blizzard to give the Alliance opponents we actually have some reason to want to fight against. They have no problem doing this for the Horde. Why is it so hard to do for the Alliance?<br />
<br />
In the 1st tier raid Uldir, alliance is fighting G'huun, which they never seen in quest. And 2nd tier raid, Alliance is killing Rastakan, which they have never met. <br />
<br />
Zandalari trolls didn't burn Teldrassil or invade Darkshore, all this makes little sense to Alliance. It will make much more sense for Alliance to raid Orgrimmar than this.</div></div><hr />

IMO for entry raid it was both pretty cool and very well balanced encounter-wise with difficulty being just right.<br />
<br />
The only real issue I can think of is G'huun being a complete management nightmare, I think Blizz have really overextended there and should take a notch back next time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, Taloc was boring, fetid was boring, vectis was annoying, zek could have been interesting but ended up just being a mild add encounter, Zul was just a glorified add encounter, mythrax was HORRIBLE for melee and g'huun, while interesting was a nightmare from a management perspective.<br />
<br />
Mother was the only fight I liked, but even then if you were one of the first over, it was kind of boring.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's been announced but something needs to change into the allied races to account for them in the &quot;retelling&quot; so baring the class incompatibilities I'd expect highmountain and lightforged switch, and same for v.elf/nightborne and mahtar/dark iron</div></div><hr />

Took me a few rereads before I understood why there was no Mekka/Blockade/Jaina equivalents. Fair enough, should be interesting even if the race conversion explanation was a little weird/almost unnecessary.<br />
<br />
there is only 3 shared bosses.<br />
the other 6 are faction specific, and you hear what hapepned by talking as an npc and they &quot;explain&quot; (You do the raid as the opposite faction) what happend while you were gone.<br />

you mean liek how most bosses in history are?<br />
many bosses in every raid ever are people who just &quot;show up&quot; want examples?<br />
The first 3 bosses in ICC<br />
Professor, and his two.<br />
The green gal<br />
<br />
literally all of Uldluar other then the keepers.<br />
need more?<br />

Ah yes, the good ol' Horde bias where they get a city raided, an important NPC murdered, the Golden Fleet destroyed and where the Alliance leaders don't die<br />
<br />
i think you forget the alliance fleet is also destroyed...<br />
also this is the first time the ALLIANCE has raided THE HORDE.<br />
last time it was alliance AND HORDE raiding GARROSH<br />
<br />
also mekkatorque &quot;dies&quot;<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
That's because there are no more Horde characters. They've killed most of them.<br />
Nathanos and Sylvanas will probably die at the same time.<br />
<br />
literally 3 have died, thats not even a third.<br />
<br />

Isn't the raid out with 8.1.5...? I was under the impression that would be the case and the KT/Zandalari would be part of that...?<br />

no, they will be shortly after the raid, most likely the week or a week after the final lfr wing comes out.<br />

what a fuck is this ? why have alliance not 3 horde opponents and vice versa ? why the hell should my alliance toon battle jaina (ofc i read the blog post). what the fukin fuk fuck ?<br />
<br />
(ps: i am playing both, horde and alliance)<br />
<br />
ok i know its hard to read or maybe hard to understand but<br />
<br />
Horde:<br />
Enter raid and battle 3 bosses<br />
They then find out the alliance has raided the city and killed the king. they are told by an NPC how this happens<br />
In gameplay you become alliance and &quot;act out' the attack, killing the 3 bosses<br />
You then fight back the alliance and fight the last alliance 3 bosses.<br />
<br />
Alliance: <br />
Enter raid and battle 3 bosses<br />

they then retreat, and talk to a NPC who tells you what happened<br />

*sigh* the two races that flagshipped Allied races as the main feature of the expansion not until never. *SAD*<br />
<br />
Also:<br />
<br />
&quot;Tauren: Most tauren will turn into draenei, while draenei druids will become night elves.&quot;<br />
<br />
Draenei druids?? !!<br />
<br />
kultiran did not flagship ally race.<br />
there was 6 races, and zandalari was one, kultiran was not one of those.<br />
we have the other 5, and an extra 1 right now.<br />
<br />
also that was a typo, they meant tauren druids.<br />
<br />

So blizzard really hates alliance even being able to pretend to look like high elves kind of bs that blood elves are basically allowed for no class but paladin and demon hunter.<br />
<br />
i cant.. is this english? what are you talking about?<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
so let me get this straight : In the expac of faction war and thus faction pride , blizz force us to transform into the opposite faction to fight ? That's so fucking dumb it's definitly a Blizzard decision.<br />
<br />
they are retelling you the story and you are 'acting&quot; as the other faction.<br />
you arte not literally transforming, you are just being told the story, by acting out the raid.<br />
if you want to cry, cry that all the way back in tbc and wotlk the caverns of time dungeons transformed you into alliance members as horde.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I am still searching the faction war in this expac.<br />
<br />
2 warfronts<br />
multiple zones where the faction is slaughtering the other factions members<br />
invasions every 19 hours<br />
new pvp incentives and questlines aswell as weekly quests<br />
warmode<br />
bounties<br />
airdrops<br />
pvp islands<br />
literally the new fucking raid WHICH IS A GIANT FACTION WAR</div></div><hr />

but no the advertised &quot;confirmed in BFA' were zandalari and dark iron, but were just said to come sometime around launch, which then were maghar and dark iron, with zandalari and kultiran coming later. which well are coming very soon, most likely end of feb or very early march.</div></div><hr />

I'm not aruging &quot;confirmed&quot; or not. They were adversed at the time of BFA expansion. IMHO to hold them even to the 1/4 is wrong. You also assume its the 1/4. Could be the 1/8 or even last patch.</div></div><hr />

I do not have good feelings at fighting my faction NPCs at all - maybe a reason for me to skip this raid tier or hibernate till the next raid.<br />

<br />
Seemed fairly obvious they plan to go from 250 ilvl to 1000 ilvl each xpac now, or every other xpac at the least.<br />
<br />
odd cause this was the first ilvl squish. so idk why you think they will also do ilvl squish every other expansion<br />

A shame they choose this approach, I'd have more respect if they had just gone and said &quot;ok both sides get a different experience and guess what that means completely different bosses and no we don't care if you say alliance or horde have it easier or better lore encounters there different get over it&quot;. To just break the wall and go now you are magically the other faction go kill bosses and don't ask why you are doing it is kind of pathetic.<br />
<br />
yeah lets have a raid that forces people to level and gear up the opposite faction if they wish to experience it!<br />
<br />
yeah no...<br />

<br />
Not particularly excited to come back to the game to end a raid dressing up as a greenskin and beating on my own faction heroes. What happened with the idea of having the raid structured different per faction? Shame that didn't happen. Doesn't seem anyone except the usual suspects who praise anything in the game no matter what are happy with this.<br />
<br />
Oh well, Orbonne Monastery will keep me entertained until Azshara I suppose. Or maybe I'll be completely detoxed by then.<br />
<br />
it is... it is exactly how they explained it at blizzcon, and i dont think you understand what the raid itself acts like...<br />
also they never said it would be two raids, they said there was going to be 2 raids, one being the raid, the other being a 2 boss one in stormsong, and there is.<br />
they explained there will be 3 shared bosses with faction reskins<br />
then there will be 3 horde bosses, and 3 alliance bosses, able to experiance the other factions through an npc.<br />

Yeah, I intended to use my expansion boost to get a Kul Tiran character to play with a friend... still waiting on doing that. Whenever you get around to it, Blizz.<br />

What motivation would an Alliance player possibly have to beat up their own leaders, especially after the humiliaton Alliance players have endured in BfA so far ... /facepalm<br />
<br />
not how it works, alliance does not beat up their own leaders, they talk to an npc to see what happened, then &quot;act out the story&quot; as the other faction.<br />

It doesn't matter if my toon gets transformed into a Horde toon, it's you who doesn't seem to understand. And how is Rastakan even equally Horde as Jaina and Meqatorque are Alliance? Answer: he isn't. He's a nobody in the Horde. <br />
<br />
So Alliance gets to beat up their own leaders while Horde gets to beat up Alliance leaders, too. <br />
How about the Alliance players get to beat up some actual Horde leaders instead?<br />

Say maybe Alliance got a world first because their order was faster, but it would be an Alliance world first as per the leaderboards, Horde race would still be going. Same happened with Uldir, Horde leaderboards were full but Alliance race was still going. Alas.<br />
<br />
there is still &quot;world first&quot; alliance or horde, doesent matter, yes there is &quot;alliance first&quot; and &quot;horde first&quot; but there is still &quot;world first&quot; so yes, it would have made alliance magorly in favor by having their easier bosses first, meaning more loot for them.<br />

In vanilla a 15 minute round of world quests or 20 minutes of AFKing a warfront didn't get you BWL level gear.<br />
<br />
a run of diremaul got you BWL level gear.<br />
or a kill on a world boss did.<br />

<br />
<br />
And this, people, is what happens when they do innovative stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Missing out on the raid for some BS faction pride might just be even more asinine than the release schedule of allied races.<br />
<br />
its the nintendo problem. <br />
&quot;WE WANT INNOVATION&quot;<br />
nintendo releases a brand new mario with literally 1 new thing<br />
people absolutly LOVE the game, but hate the 1 new thing<br />
every year they buy the new mario.<br />
<br />
also some call it the cod conundrum<br />
&quot;WE WANT INNOVATION&quot;<br />
*They release COD again, with literally no changes* <br />
*Everyone buys the game*<br />
WE WANT INNOVATION!<br />
<br />
<br />
People say they want something new and cool, but then they scream and cry when they do.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I'll probably do the raid on Normal as per usual and go back to FF14 since 4.5 will be fresh by then.<br />
<br />
I just think they could have done better than the &quot;faction swap&quot;. It's just what they do with certain dungeons/events and it's not innovative whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Hell drop a boss and make the last 2 faction specific bosses or something. World First hasn't meant squat in WoW for years. Or hell maybe someone other than Method could have had a shot at it.<br />
<br />
yeah no... you cant lock entire parts of a raid to a faction.</div></div><hr />

Rofl, no, just.... no diremaul gear was never close to BWL gear, DM wasn't even a level 60 instance. And world bosses had good gear yes, but they were also relatively rare and monopolized by the top guilds on the server, the vast majority of players never saw a tagged kill of a WB much less gear from it.<br />

You would farm low level instances for niche, one off, resist gear, but it didn't mean it was BWL &quot;level&quot;</div></div><hr />

And 2nd tier raid, Alliance is killing Rastakan, which they have never met. <br />

Zandalari trolls didn't burn Teldrassil or invade Darkshore, all this makes little sense to Alliance. It will make much more sense for Alliance to raid Orgrimmar than this.<br />
<br />
Alliance in cannon dont go to uldir, would you rather blizz have just said &quot;Ok alliance uhh no raid for yall, gotta wait till 8.1... sorry we dont want yall killing uldir&quot;<br />

also the zandalari trolls have chosen to ally with the horde, and i think you forget that the zandalari have been fighting the alliance for a long, logn time.<br />

MC, not a last drop. Sure a lot of people had stuff from dungeons, because loot was rare. That's quite the opposite of &quot;I afked a warfront for 20 minutes and got heroic uldir level loot&quot; which was the entire point I was making, loot is too easy to get nowadays.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean you are right but at this point it seems you are just debating with someone who is in the &quot;WoW is flawless and in a perfect spot&quot; crowd.<br />
<br />
There WAS better Dungeon gear in Vanilla absolutely. But nowhere is it like the current game.<br />
<br />
Getting 385 gear from a Warfront is stupid. It does not require the same amount of effort as a Mythic raid. Of course I'll go for it ofc because it's free gear.<br />
<br />
You should NOT be getting current Mythic item level gear from something you can afk in. Period. It breaks natural gear progression. FF14 does it right imo. It lets Savage raid players get their gear first then people to get a similar item level later on.<br />
<br />
Example being current Savage gear from 4.4 which was 3-4 months ago is 400/405. Right now people who don't raid Savage can get 390 gear or 380. And in the upcoming patch can upgrade that 390 gear to ilvl 400. However some raid pieces will still be superior due to stat weights.<br />
<br />
Warfronts should be a guaranteed 355 at most for the initial quest and 340 for Stromgarde. And a guaranteed 385 for Darkshore quest WHEN the raid opens as that is the item level of Normal.<br />
<br />
Now if Heroic Warfronts in 8.2 are as hard as they say then imo on par with HC raid gear. No doubt.</div></div><hr />

now here is something funny that makes me laugh.<br />
you seem to forget that molten core had its loot reworked later in vanilla.<br />
that item had no where near that stats at the launch of molten core<br />
for example teir 1 was literally absolute shit until it got fixed.<br />
also did you know teir 2 dropped in molten core? yep. eventually got moved to black wing lair, only the legs being in molten core, and got buffed to compensate <br />
also heroic uldir is not mythic uldir, so again i dont see your point.<br />
i feel like your a person who calls LFR hardcore raiding maybe?</div></div><hr />

I feel like a lot of the &quot;better dungeon gear&quot; came down to just Vanilla's poor itemization and the lack of experience in the dev team. Nowadays though, it's complete and willful ignorance for proper progression paths.

i have made threads, posts, etc about what dislike in the past, and problems i have, but people love to scoop that under the rug, including you right now.<br />
if you wish i could list the few hundred things i dislike about the game right now and go on a massive blog post.<br />
but that is not good is it? so why the fuck must i do that to prove im not some &quot;blizz white knight&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. And the path of least resistance is a stupidly easy one compared to a Mythic raid boss.<br />
<br />
Hell LFR takes more brains to do than a Warfront.<br />
<br />
As I said. The quest for Stromgarde should be 355. The 340 drops at the end are fine.<br />
<br />
Darkshore should be 385 once this raid is out. Until then make it 355. <br />
<br />

You're rather daft aren't you? Doesn't really matter that &quot;shit got buffed&quot;, the whole point is gear rains from the sky today, you actually had to work for it before. And Vanilla wasn't even a good game, it was just new and we were bad.<br />

Someone in another thread tried to argue that they need 385 gear when they didn't even bother raiding, or doing M+, or even pvping, and that I was &quot;wrong&quot; for playing to improve my character.... god can't wait for 4.5 in FF and Shadowbringers this summer. <br />

And as bonus points, they told me I deserved 385 gear too, even though I don't Mythic raid anymore, when I said I in no way deserve it.</div></div><hr />

I mean yeah I go for the 385 gear but I raid Normal at most.<br />

Highest ilvl I need in theory is 355-360.<br />

I'm 371 and not touched a single HC or have a single Titanforged. It's all from Warfronts. How the fuck is that normal? Why should I be rewarded 370/385 gear for doing something that is equivalent to LFR or hell easier?<br />

Yes, my 370 character that I leveled 2-3 weeks ago totally had to work for his gear from incursions, warfronts, emissaries, etc. Only thing that's actually work that is higher is Mythic raiding, which I don't have the time, nor want, to do.

You can get 355 Azerite stuff from miscarries before even being 355. I started getting my ones at 345 I think?<br />

I remember it taking me a fuckton of time to get the Emblems of Frost needed to get a ICC quality piece. In fact I think I only ended Wrath on 1 or 2 pieces. You barely got any Emblems daily as a casual player.<br />
<br />
Emblems and points are good progression imo. By the time you are working on the currency gear it's likely you will have some raid gear to compliment it as a raider.<br />
<br />
As a non raider it takes you a lot longer to gear than a raider. Simple as that. Nowadays it takes little effort to be 355 or 370.<br />
<br />
I mean Fel is just being flat out dishonest at this point. The system existed. But the system was design in mind back then so that more casual players took so long to gear up that by the time they were the raiders had most if not all of their gear.</div></div><hr />

Yea, the only way to get them if you didn't raid was your 1 dungeon for 2 a day. Quest before LFG was in, and then just a random heroic after. There was a one time quest in the ICC dungeons for a couple, but it wasn't much.<br />
<br />

Since he was the one added late in Wrath. VoA was literally a casuals paradise. You got tier but only 2 pieces. And so was Baradin Hold imo.</div></div><hr />

You could still be cockblocked by &quot;LFM VOA 5.5k GS!&quot; but yea, he may have dropped a couple.</div></div><hr />

Oh god yeah. GS was absolutely stupid imo. Unfortunately that stupid &quot;raider io&quot; seems to have taken the place of GS these days.</div></div><hr />

Wrath was good because the catchup gear was 232 at most. That got you barely into ICC and tbh most groups wouldn't take you.<br />
<br />
Catchup mechanisms are fine imo at the end of an expansion. That Dauntless gear in Legion was stupid. Should have not been anything till the end. Relinquished 910 was fine.</div></div><hr />

I always liked the badge gear, and catchup dungeons, like the ICC ones. Funny thing is, those are also things I like about FFXIV, but I just can't get enough people to stick around in it.</div></div><hr />

Emmisaries up to 370 piece<br />

Yea, the only way to get them if you didn't raid was your 1 dungeon for 2 a day. Quest before LFG was in, and then just a random heroic after. There was a one time quest in the ICC dungeons for a couple, but it wasn't much.<br />
<br />
And those dungeons themselves weren't the easiest when they came out....<br />
<br />
the emisarries do not always give gear, and they require high ilvl to get so.<br />
warfronts you seem to forget are once every like... 3 weeks<br />
world bosses yeah once per week or reset but rare. and again the 385 one is only every 3 weeks</div></div><hr />

The currency gear is what attracted me to FF14. No relying on RNG or crap like Titanforging to be powerful. <br />
<br />
A 380 piece is a simple 380 piece. That's it.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to keep arguing about it, but it's easy, and incursions are easily the biggest source, it's 1-2 a day.<br />

Yup, you know what you're getting when you get it. Though I can't say I really enjoy Eureka for artifact gear advancement this go around, lets hope they find something better in Shadowbringers.</div></div><hr />

Incursions should give you whatever your current item level is too. I'm 345 on Hunter and it shows 350/355.<br />
<br />
But nice to see misinformation being spread by the guy you quoting.<br />
<br />
Warfronts cycle a lot quicker through the contribution cycle as of late and the emisarries give you higher than your equpped item level at a specific threshold.<br />
<br />
I started getting 350/355+ Azerite pieces and caches at 340-345 on my Hunter. Why should I be allowed to get Normal quality gear?<br />

I just enjoy the fact that I'm an omnicrafter and have all this 350 gear lol. Working on upgrading it before I took a break again but I'll be back around next week.</div></div><hr />

19 hours each, so if you are really playing to do every single incursion... yeah... playing every single hour of the day will do that</div></div><hr />

<br />
And 5 months is the standard/slightly faster for raid tiers. Content in between or not.<br />
<br />
Raids are coming out at the same pace they have been for years. Regardless of what content is in between.<br />
<br />
I mostly don't agree with the gating however. LFR doesn't need that much gating but of course it's just to boost the MAU's these days sadly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny thing is, and I've always said this even before LFR took SO long, it doesn't even help. Those who are going to subscribe for the new LFR are just going to wait til the end of february to sub and probably sub for a shorter period of time.<br />
<br />
What's the difference if the get a sub on Jan 23 and they cancel after a month, or they sub on Feb 27 and cancel after a month?</div></div><hr />

Your entire faction has been the bad guy since day dot. The whole horde shtick is to war and pillage. If you are unhappy playing the villains, play the other faction.</div></div><hr />

also they never said it would be two raids, they said there was going to be 2 raids, one being the raid, the other being a 2 boss one in stormsong, and there is.<br />
they explained there will be 3 shared bosses with faction reskins<br />
then there will be 3 horde bosses, and 3 alliance bosses, able to experiance the other factions through an npc.<br />
<br />
I do understand how the raid will work, that's why I said it was a shame. Both factions do the raid in the same order just switching races for some of the bosses, and I had hoped they would do it in different order since that would have been a novelty. Doesn't seem I'm the only person. I'm not demanding anything or saying they promised anything just what I personally think. No need to grab your cape and sword to defend them, people can like or not like things at their will.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Missing out on the raid for some BS faction pride might just be even more asinine than the release schedule of allied races.<br />
<br />
Right? It's not like they drilled faction pride in people's heads in the lead up to, and during this whole expansion basically setting themselves up for this. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
Just because one change wasn't well received doesn't mean all forms of innovation won't be well received either. This one was just particularly shortsighted.</div></div><hr />

It's literally just a simple race flip that's used in other instances. Or with toys.<br />

Maybe the raid is awesome don't get me wrong. But how they are handling the perspective is absolutely lazy and shoddy.<br />

True that, they should have gone legion way of pacing, but maybe the shitshow they did with BFA at the start made them delay content, and that is sad.</div></div><hr />

And thank god no, If her development were still the same as in Mop-Legion then yes, kill her as a last boss of some raid. But the development she has in this expansion made me like her once again and find interesting what that will bring to the future, so big no to killing her now, at least from me.</div></div><hr />
