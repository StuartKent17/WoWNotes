Yeah, instagibbed that's the word. They used ~50 hours on hard mode Mimiron, that is SO instagib.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe it's actually one hour per RAID RESET (per week).<br />
<br />
10 mans are the testing grounds for 25 man raids. Now that they've got the strat down for Algalon, it's on to the 25 man achievement.</div></div><hr />

And yes I know I am not ensidia they are the best guild it doesn't matter if they kill it first, blah blah blah. I still think its stupid that the boss only needed 3(?? did they have him unlocked for longer?, maybe 4) hours of attempts on the boss to kill him, sure they were perfect attempts but they say mimiron hard mode was a lot harder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah because watchers hardmode in 10 man is so fucking hard...<br />
NOT<br />
It's easy as shit, Thorim and Hodir are LOLROFLMAO, Freya is 4 to 10 trys, only MImiron takes like 1 or two raiddays á 4 hours.<br />
<br />
So only cause you're a boon (and must flame here somebodys RL, yeah that sound like your RL must be über) and needs like 2 years for these hardmodes, that doesn't mean that some other players need that time</div></div><hr />

Ensidia goes hard for a few weeks... gets the job done. Then after that, they can sit back and clear the instance in one day... while casuals like yourself are still raiding 3-4 days a week trying to match what they had done 3 months prior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
- Ensidia doesnt get paid for playing<br />
- Ensidia didnt exploit any boss<br />
- only one of 4 Ulduar10 grps of Ensidia killed Algalon<br />
- Kungen nor Meckstar (or so) werent present at this kill<br />
- it took them basicely 4 hours (4 weeks) to down Algalon<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, they killed Yogg-Saron without Watchers with 2 grps in 10 men too.</div></div><hr />

I think his original points was that everyone is all up on kungen's dick like it was his achievement, and I don't even see him in the screenshot. (9 members are visible in the provided screenie). I'm not denying that he's a good warrior and a hell of a tank, and most probably a damn good raid leader (assuming he leads them, he used to in tbc afaik), I'm just saying that people are posting uninformed praises to kungen, when they really have no idea what's going on.<br />
<br />
I guess that's just the beauty of the internet.<br />
<br />
edit: holy shit syncmaster posted something informed!<br />
edit2: well, technically they 'exploited' for the original hodir hard mode kill (before the timer was nerfed). They used a buff they were not ment to have during the encounter due to bliz not leashing the mobs from the conservatory of life, and the buff being spellstealable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
- Ensidia doesnt get paid for playing<br />
- Ensidia didnt exploit any boss<br />
- only one of 4 Ulduar10 grps of Ensidia killed Algalon<br />
- Kungen nor Meckstar (or so) werent present at this kill<br />
- it took them basicely 4 hours (4 weeks) to down Algalon<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, they killed Yogg-Saron without Watchers with 2 grps in 10 men too.<br />
<br />
Lady vashj she bugged out and was sitting there at 1 health then a priest popped back up using ss and swd her then another one respawned right after</div></div><hr />

Finding PvE boring as hell. Downing the boss for 1st time is a nice feeling but having to farm shit over and over again aint what I call pleasant.<br />

Vashj they got a bugged shield slam or something that knocked off 50% of her health. She was 100% unkillable pre-nerf (the only other guild that got it soulstoned the entire raid, and they still only had a couple alive at the end). Not necessarily an exploit, but also not a valid claim for world first. This is evidenced by the fact that for the month+ (however long it took to nerf it, I dont remember exactly) after that kill they did not repeat.<br />
<br />
Hodir was exploited much the same way as the mage that exploited to solo naxx. If you consider it one or not doesnt matter since they both produce the same results and blizzard suspended/banned mages that did the naxx bug.<br />
<br />
Regardless, grats to them... I look forward to trying the fight soon (hopefully this next week if people can stop studying for school and show up for our 10 man group &gt;&lt;).</div></div><hr />

Sorry, bro - but without any proofs, thats just another claim. Tell us how they produced the shield slam bug, and how exactly you know that she was 100% unkillable. The boss got hotfixed the day after they killed her - in v1.0 it was only killed by Nihilum, just like atm Mimiron hardmode is theirs with some taiwanease guild.<br />
<br />
How is spellstealing an exploit? The spellstealing of the bonearmor was actually a very common way to beat the constructor, when you didnt had enought priests.</div></div><hr />

To SyncMaster's comment:<br />
<br />
- it took them basically 4 hours (4 weeks) to down Algalon<br />
<br />
If I were Ensidia, each week I would have scheduled the four 10 man group attempts on Algalon in succession... each group complete their attempt, pass any information and strategies to the next group, etc. <br />
<br />
Assuming each 10 man group were able to reach Algalon from the first week, then that's ~16 hours available to Ensidia as a guild - admittedly, each group would need to experience and get used to the fight, etc. So, 4 hours is a little generous! ;)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing of the World First 25 man Algalon kill.... although I think we still have quite a wait!</div></div><hr />

How does linking someone's Armory prove anything? The bosses in WoW are a joke, they're not hard. It's getting 9/24 other people to all react at the same time and know what they're doing that is the hard part. It's basically playing Donkey Kong with 9/24 people, but if a single one of those people can't jump over the barrel, you and the other people lose.<br />

If you think that way, then what is hard? Nothing? Playing any instrument is really easy, you just move your hands around in different patterns. Painting a masterpiece is actually even easier. Only thing you have to do is putting paint on a brush and drawing it on a canvas. Driving a formula is damn easy. You just rotate the wheel and push pedals in a certain pattern through the course.<br />

No, you stupid prick. I´m comparing the fact that someone claims that something isn´t hard because you just have to do things in a certain pattern. Usually idiots like you keep on saying that wow isn´t hard at all but you still fail to advance in it. Ofcourse wow isn´t very hard, it´s a game, but saying it is just pushing a few buttons is same as saying that driving a formula is just turning the wheel.<br />
<br />
I´m not that suprised you didn´t get the example though.</div></div><hr />

That's pretty freaking interesting reading right there. While obviously severely biased, I highly doubt it's all made up.<br />
<br />
And well done, Quickman. With all the pre-emptive strikes against Ensidia trolling, he fires off a salvo which hooks all of you with a trolling rope-a-dope. Nicely done.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheRabidDeer</div><div class="date">2009-05-18, 11:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sorry, bro - but without any proofs, thats just another claim. Tell us how they produced the shield slam bug, and how exactly you know that she was 100% unkillable. The boss got hotfixed the day after they killed her - in v1.0 it was only killed by Nihilum, just like atm Mimiron hardmode is theirs with some taiwanease guild.<br />
<br />
How is spellstealing an exploit? The spellstealing of the bonearmor was actually a very common way to beat the constructor, when you didnt had enought priests.<br />
<br />
Nihilum = Ensidia, FYI. The bug isnt reproducible, it was just that... a bug. A random bug happened on one of their many hours of attempts at the unkillable vashj for world first and it gave them the kill. Kungen himself even said that they had a random bug happen that gave them the kill.<br />
Mar 29th world first: http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/03/29/nihilum-downs-vashj/<br />
May 5th world second: http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/05/09/method-man-and-vashj/<br />
<br />
Both were done pre-patch. Nihilum got a revenge crit bug from kungen, method soulstoned the entire raid (which isnt possible anymore, as this was fixed once blizzard learned of guilds doing it). A few days after method got the kill it was nerfed since it was impossible. Their soulstone the entire raid was a last ditch effort to get a prenerf kill.<br />
<br />
And about the spellstealing, I agree it shouldnt necessarily be claimed to be an exploit. However, since the mages that used it in naxx got suspended/banned, that qualified that spellstealing buffs that were not originally intended to be spellstolen is technically exploiting. It is entirely blizzards fault, but because of their actions and faults in the past it defines things for the future. The fact that they hotfixed it to not be spellstolen once ensidia told them after their hodir kill just makes it show that it was not intended.</div></div><hr />

small point. If they had 4 ulduar-10 groups, all of whom were working on Algalon, each group essentially had 1 hours of attempts + 3 hours of strat/feedback/trial &amp; error analysis. That kind of information is invaluable, so its closer to 16 hours time on the boss.<br />

Gz to Ensidia,<br />

but I am personaly more shcked at the people defending them to the bone, yeah its a good feat theres 7mill + people world wide and they are clearly the top 10 at the PvE side of it, But come on these guys didnt have 4 hours in which to learn this fight.<br />
<br />
1 hour per week - 10 man(doubting they did all the hard encounters first week)<br />
1 hour per week - 25 man(doubting they did all the hard encounters first week)<br />
1/2/3 hours per week - any alts they have ( I'm in a casual socal guild, Most people have 2/3 alts and this THE hardcorest of hardcore guilds)<br />
all of there guilds video/screen shots/info on the fights.<br />
<br />
you people keeps saying THEY ONLY HAVE 4 HOURS DERRRRRRRRRRRR are taking away from what they actually had to go thru to get this achvment.<br />

What exploit isn't &quot;Blizzard's fault&quot;?<br />
An 'exploit' in a game means that you exploit the developers' oversight - that's exactly what spellstealing a trash mob's buff that wasn't intended to be spellstolen to kill an otherwise unkillable boss is considered.</div></div><hr />

How people fail to know that Algalon is only available for 1 hour per week is something I don´t get.<br />
They spent 4 hours on him to get the kill.<br />
<br />
I seriously can´t belive that you posted this just to show how stupid you are.<br />
<br />
It´s fun to see all the flamers that are showing up when there´s an Ensidia thread.<br />
They are the best guild in the world just appriciate them for it.<br />
That´s what people do when it comes to sports for example, Hockeyplayers see Ovechkin as a great player and wish they were like him. Or football players wishing they were Steven Gerrar (Unless they are wrong and think someone like Ronaldo or Messi is better, but then they are WRONG).<br />
<br />
I can´t honestly see why half the wow community hate people because they are better then you are, yes they devote alot o time for this game so either.<br />
A. devote more time yourself and try geting there yourselves or.<br />
B. Don´t do it, realise that they will always be better then you and give them some appriciation.<br />
<br />
I seriously doubt there are many haters among other topguilds, just mutual respect among guilds.</div></div><hr />

Says the moron playing alot more than they do.<br />
<br />
They dont have to get on every day to try and clear the instance, because unlike you and your guild they do not wipe as often.<br />

<br />
1. @Compairment to best sports-players -&gt; they get payed for games. It's all about it.<br />
<br />
2. @People that say &quot;oh this game is SOOOO easy - I don't even want to try it by myself&quot; or &quot;Pfff, Ensidia just get money for play&quot; or &quot;They have no real life&quot;. Ok, I agree that wow is much less grind-game that korean ones, it is addictive game, but it seems the problem is not in bosses but more in players. They are people after all and they all got real life problems.<br />
<br />
I don't know about others but I have to work 9:00-18:00. And then I must get some shower, some dinner and other things. And the problem is - to get 24 people, who have regular online time, who ready for trying to make their class better and better and who ready not to complain about wipes and stupid purple-pixel dramas, but to WORK hard on accomplishing the boss-event.<br />
<br />
If you have a time, if you have a skill, if you have a good team - It's just a game, it isn't impossible. And Ensidia is a proof.<br />
Yes, honestly I'm jealous that I don't have some of these three things and Ensidia has but I'm just trying to do my best.<br />
<br />
P.S. And about world first. Well, so what? Algalon down - It.Is.Just.Ok. Well done, Ensidia.<br />
It seems all flame in this topic produced by people who by some reasons can't get a good raid or something, or what are they doing on MMO-Champ then?<br />
<br />
If you can't raid as Ensidia, don't flame them, they are not the reason of you raid problem. Seriously.</div></div><hr />

Playing any instrument is really easy, you just move your hands around in different patterns. Painting a masterpiece is actually even easier. Only thing you have to do is putting paint on a brush and drawing it on a canvas. Driving a formula is damn easy. You just rotate the wheel and push pedals in a certain pattern through the course.<br />
<br />
Yeah right.<br />
<br />
<br />
Playing an instrument and painting a masterpiece are bad examples. Quality in both cases is subjective. With bosses, there is simply &quot;Is he dead&quot; or &quot;Is he not dead.&quot;<br />
<br />
Driving a Formula I car is also a bad example, as if you fail at it, there's a good chance you die and don't get to try again.<br />
<br />
Long story short: You're an idiot.</div></div><hr />

2- wow is considered easy compared to OTHER games, try final fantasy 11 for example, a boss wasnt killed for ~2-3 years as far as i remember and finally got nerfed cause ppl just couldnt figure out how to do it &quot;as intended&quot; and has many hard pve aspects in the game, you don have to &quot;do it yourself&quot; to prove its easy/hard<br />
3- stop fighting over dumb unrelated things, they get paid, no they dont, who give a rats ass if they do or dont, its their business, if blizz know the real situation and think its ok whats in it for you?<br />
4- &quot;you are fags, you spend all your time on wow&quot;..... dude, very big fat /clap for your achievements that benefited humanity and changed the way we live, this is a game ok? a lot of ppl get addicted to games for so many reasons, if they think they will get enough satisfaction by spending most of their time in the game its up to them, as long as they are harmless.<br />
5- i assume a lot of ppl are like me, casual players, i didnt really get much into raiding after wow vanilla, and final fantasy end game was too much to handle specially with time difference so had to quit. i dont really fight to go to raids, or to do hard modes, but would be nice to do these stuff, i enjoy them, yet i can spend most of my time in-game idling in dalaran chatting with friends, stop your &quot;i dont see it in your achievement you weak ass, you have no saying in this&quot; its dumb and annoying, if a person is right/wrong is irrelevant to his &quot;achievements&quot;, he might have 200 more achievements than you and still say nonsense, if he is ignorant, you can correct him at best, trying to &quot;fix&quot; his misleading information/statement<br />
6- stop overrating/underrating everything, they downed the boss before anyone else did, good for them, gz, why do we must have a war to attack/defend them now? something was done, might deserve a bit of clap and whistle, but not worth including in Guinness<br />
7- stop getting offended by ppl who are posting hate shit to have a cheap laugh on your genius mind that keep answering their posts with anger<br />
<br />
i might never even see this boss in my life, thats why watching a vid would be nice, hope they release it sooner than later</div></div><hr />

Just last year kovalainen hit a wall doing 170mph you have no idea about Formula 1 if you think people die driving nowadays. Inface Nakajima and Pique find it hard to ever finish a race there awful<br />

Every serious raiding guild is/will be using 10 man Algalon as practice for 25 man Algalon.<br />

<br />
<br />
- Ensidia doesnt get paid for playing<br />
- Ensidia didnt exploit any boss<br />
- only one of 4 Ulduar10 grps of Ensidia killed Algalon<br />
- Kungen nor Meckstar (or so) werent present at this kill<br />
- it took them basicely 4 hours (4 weeks) to down Algalon<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, they killed Yogg-Saron without Watchers with 2 grps in 10 men too.<br />
<br />
<br />
The person behind Ensidia, Kungen, Mackzter and Meka is no less than the Crown Prince of Dubai, son of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.

No you should know your facts sir.<br />
The Sheikh didn't &quot;end up in SK-Gaming&quot;, he bought the Enhancement Shaman Morphling a few weeks after they killed KJ.<br />
(Yes the same person that (most likely) bought Zeuzonita's old account.)<br />
Yes the Sheikh did pay for Mackster's apartment for some time.<br />

Separate in 3 teams<br />
<br />
All 3 teams sit on vent - one team get's in (having all infrastructure they have, streaming it is prolly good way of sharing the fight)<br />
<br />
First team spend 1h in in their ID - Algalon despawned, sharing ideas and strategies... 2nd team get's in, makes some progress and end up closer then previous one... then you have same thing happens for 3rd team... <br />

It appears that the Reply-Code item/quest is open to anyone present at the kill, as a standard &quot;head&quot; reward, no matter whether you did the &quot;key&quot; quest for Algalon or not. So, when distributing the Archivum Data Disk, you don't have to think about who might get the most benefit from the Reply-Code quest (that is, of course, if you manage to down Algalon before everyone in the raid has completed the key quest anyway, 10 or 25 man) just who has the most raid attendance (for Watcher Hardmodes and Algalon attempts)</div></div><hr />

<br />
2). Why is it every time Ensidia makes a world first, there is a lot of F.....g Whiners and then it all coms back to that they are payed to play, So WHAT Envy is a bad thing get over it, it's the same thing as u having a job i'll bet u dont work for free. And thinking about all the time they put in it, to be the best and first on the bosses then i dont think a littet payment is all wrong. The thing about them getting their apartments payed for, i have a very hard time beliving that, maby and that is a big maby one or two of the top dog's i the guild get somthing like that but i doubt it. <br />
<br />
3).I see that some still dont get why Ensidia used the flowerpower, and yes maby it was cheat to some eyes, but if i was blocked from getting world first coz blizz fucked up I whoud have done the same thing, and they have taken him down again after blizz fixed, so plz!! Get over It.<br />

Blizzard put World buffs in the game for players to get buffed.<br />
Blizzard put Warlock summons in the game for players to get summoned.<br />
<br />
1+1=2<br />
2 = not cheating.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how using a buff to help you kill a boss is in any way shape or form cheating.<br />
<br />
BLIZZARD PUT IT IN THE GAME !!!<br />

If your too dumb enough to think of solutions to help your guild kill bosses. Then poor you. But to call others cheating for using their brains is a pretty low thing to do tbh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Difficulty is related to 3 principle factors: 1) Performance of a raid unit (i.e. player skills, both individually and as a team), 2) Relative complexity of or familiarity with the encounter mechanics, 3) Gear level relative to Blizzard's internally specified 'minimum requirement for completing the encounter'. The interaction of these 3 factors determine a Raid's success at an encounter. <br />
<br />
We know that as far as point 1) is concerned, Ensidia are amongst the best, both individually but more importantly as a team that acts and reacts as a well trained unit. We have no real idea about 2) since nobody's really talking about the encounter yet. We know, based on the fact that nobody raiding earned 'Herald of the Titans', that they defeated Algalon 10-man wearing their 25 man (Hard Mode) gear. While their achievement is significant, they've altered the three factors in their favour by outgearing the encounter. They've effectively worn a tier of gear higher than the encounter is 'supposed' to require, nullifying much of the difficulty of the encounter. This is the inherent danger of having 2 tiers of content that can be played by the same character (I really think it's time to consider having a shared raid lockout across 10 and 25...). I have no doubt they'll get him down in Heroic, but that will be the real achievement because they'll be approaching the encounter as Blizzard intended it to be balanced- this one is somewhat tainted by the gear disparity tilting things in their favour...</div></div><hr />

Now the result, Ensidia, is a commercial operation to monopolise the content releases in a for-profit production line, and also to attempt in marketing/propaganda to associate that with individual skill (even though that doesn't exist in any case because in WoW there is no concept of an individual endgame). After each release we now get a press release (not a message, a press release) of how easy it was - unlike the Sunwell which they didn't get. And unexcitingly the Ensidia &quot;1st&quot; cartel will just continue to the end of WoW because there will never be a Sunwell 2. Every new instance may look new, but ultimately the difficulty levels are not new, and so the level of competition recedes with every release.<br />
<br />
So tell us when a different team gets a &quot;1st&quot;, of people who are just playing for fun ... now _that_ will be exciting.</div></div><hr />

My question is, Why do people get so uptight? Because you didn't do it first?<br />
<br />
Do they get paid to play? who honestly cares? Does getting paid give you more skills than the next guy? Personally i hate my job, so getting paid to play would prolly make me not want to play :D :D<br />
<br />
If you can do something that you love to do, and make a profit at doing it then more power to ya. They're obviously good at what they do, or they wouldn't get paid (pending the article is true). <br />

I'll give you some facts:<br />
- You don't know anything.<br />
- You don't know if Ensidia are paid.<br />
- You don't know if Ensidia exploit.<br />
- Noone cares what you think anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
They do get paid to play. THATS FACT.<br />
<br />
They are a fully sponsored guild by a prince of Dubai in the UAE (United Arab Emirates). On top of this Nihilum and Sk.WoW merged. SK.gaming has ALWAYS been fully sponsored going back to their origin in counter strike with sk.swe (heaton, potti, etc, etc). When I say sponsored, I mean paid a salary to play, have computers bought for them, etc. I was on a pro team in cs and played in the CGS in source. Things like this DO happen.<br />
<br />
And for the final nail in the coffin, here is an exerp from their &quot;Merge statement on their site&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ensidia is a joint effort by members of two of the top guilds in World of Warcraft, with the support and endorsement of a private entity based in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Our guilds have made being at the forefront of PVE progression our modus operandi since the first installment of this game and, as Ensidia, we will continue to do so.&quot;<br />

Hmm, yes, that's pretty conclusive. That statement you quoted clearly states 'Every member of Ensidia gets paid 50,000 Euros a year to play WOW'. Seriously, that statement is not a 'nail in the coffin'- if the 'support and endorsement' consisted of them paying for the hosting and development of the Ensidia web portal would that constitute them being paid to play? If they bought a new PC for each member would that count? What is your definition of 'paid to play'- if it's 'each member gets a salary from some rich sheik to play wow' then you've offered up zero evidence of that fact and should stfu and stop name calling until you can. Clearly they get some form of sponsorship. Nobody knows if the value of that is 50 Euros or 5 million Euros and until somebody does you have no right to throw this 'paid to play' bullshit in their faces...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure thing, a first is a first even if by luck, exploit or just plain skill. In the WoW PvE arena same rules apply to all the guilds. Smart use of game mechanics is&#8230; well smart use of game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Did they overgear the 10man version?<br />
<br />
Of course but that applies to all the other guilds in the world no? I mean I don&#8217;t think there are top guilds out there that tried to kill him with the &#8220;Herald of the Titans&#8221; achievement in mind. Like all sane people you kill a boss with all the tools you have first then check all other options.<br />
<br />
Is calling an encounter not that hard while you overgear it lame?<br />
<br />
As lames as it gets.<br />
<br />
Are all those people going mental over the fact that a guild killed some scripted pixels sane?<br />
<br />
Doubt it&#8230; I mean idolizing an athlete, a singer, a guitar player etc. is more or less normal but idolizing a professional game player? Sad the least, me thinks.<br />
<br />
Will Ensidia be the first guild in the world that kills Algalon 25man?<br />
<br />
Very very highly possible.<br />
<br />
Is WoW PvE as completive as the PvP scene is?<br />
<br />
Nope&#8230; Ensidia more or less dominates the whole thing.<br />
<br />
Are all of the above a huge big pile of trash that concerns the universe karma?<br />

qft. I lol'ed when he said Freya with three adds = 4-10 tries :p<br />
<br />
Yes, i don't have either mimiron or freya hardmode down, but thats because we only raid 10 man for 1 or 2 day(s) a week(don't can play 24/7, and there is 25 too), and last ID was the first ID where we seriously take on the achivments. We got Freya with 2 adds down in 2nd try, and it was very easy (with 2 healers) So next time we take 3 healers and optimize the damage classes, and yes, i don't think that we need more than 10 trys :)<br />

I lost all respect for Ensidia, when they came out after completing the initial raids in WotLK complaining they were too easy. Most top end guilds take the game far too seriously for the rest of the population and use it as a tool for which they can further their 'e-reputation'. I'll be the first to admit that I'm far from the most skilled player, but when a guild who are &quot;sponsored&quot; to play release a statement and act as if it's a common premise from all players and is for the betterment of the game, it really frustrates me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm, yes, that's pretty conclusive. That statement you quoted clearly states 'Every member of Ensidia gets paid 50,000 Euros a year to play WOW'.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">NotValidAnymore</div><div class="date">2009-05-19, 01:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So either, people claim that the people of Ensidia have no life and/or that they exploited the encounter...<br />
<br />
Or they just post something like &quot;ENSIDIA WON THEY ARE THE BEST YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS GO DIE WHILE I SUCK THEIR PENIS&quot;.<br />
<br />
Seriously guys, it's enough with a simple &quot;Congratulations&quot;, or &quot;Grats!&quot; if you want. You don't have to get all stuck-up because they killed Algalon and you didn't. And you don't have to be all over Ensidia's genitals because you want to be on &quot;the winner team&quot;.<br />
<br />
And seriously, no matter how you think about them getting paid, it just sounds dumb. Most of the reason why they kill bosses first is because they have the time and resources, and the willpower, to do it, not because they get fueled up by cash or something stupid like that.<br />
<br />
You guys should be ashamed of yourselves, seriously. A guild kills a really hard boss and all you guys are saying is &quot;they probably exploited it&quot;? &quot;It's not that hard anyway&quot;? &quot;Yeah, of course, they're the best and I'm their biggest fan!&quot;? Don't be so damn stupid. All you have to say is &quot;Congratulations!&quot; or &quot;Good job!&quot; or something like that. They killed him first, so now you guys can't do that. You don't have to act like assholes or suck up to them because of that.<br />
<br />
Try to do something else that takes skill, or just don't care about it at all. You don't play this game to win. You play to have fun. And don't take that the wrong way; of course you have to win certain things to get further in the game. But what's the purpose of that if you don't have fun while doing it? Exactly: there is no reason at all. It's as stupid as coming to these kinds of forums and posting lots of crap when you're not even playing the game.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Ensidia, from the Resurrection guild on The Venture Co. EU server, !Congratulations on World First Algalon 10-Man Kill! ;)</div></div><hr />

1. EU servers went online 7 hours later after the US ones.<br />
2. Ensidia was THE ONLY guild to kill Hodir in 2 minutes, even tho THEY HAD TO exploit it.<br />
3. Because of Ensidia, Hodir's hard mode was adjusted back to 3 minutes.<br />
4. They got the first 10 man Glory achieve<br />
5. They got the first 10 man Algalon kill<br />
<br />
Yet you guys are just jealous about their kills, and say that they suck ?<br />
What did they do?<br />
<br />
They just said: &quot;Algalon 10 down&quot;...<br />
<br />
CONGRATS ENSIDIA !</div></div><hr />

<br />
They downed it legit without buffs after the fix.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fixed.<br />
<br />
Seriously, they aren't using the external buffs on hodir any more. Stop going on about how using the only option avaliable to them once while the boss was still mathamatically unbeatable invalidates all their accomplishments.<br />
<br />
Grats to them. Well earned... but now, what the heck do we do with all these 10 man tears? You guys just don't know how to plan ahead... maybe 25 Algalon will accept 10 man tears for feeding. Hope he's not picky.</div></div><hr />

That boss is also completely impossible to do.<br />
68 milion hp in 6 minutes...<br />
19dps - 1 tank - 5 healers<br />
DPS needs to do a sustainable 9941 dps which is impossible unless you get any buffs.<br />
considering you have to run out each time a crap is cast on you, and you have to use LUST on the heart, you won't have lust for the boss.<br />
<br />
In a 3 minute Hodir the dps is usually at 9k-10k with all the buffs that you get from the adds.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: impossible atm.</div></div><hr />

endorse definition <br />
en·dorse (en dôrs&#8242;, in-)<br />
<br />
transitive verb endorsed -·dorsed&#8242;, endorsing -·dors&#8242;·ing<br />
<br />
to write on the back of (a document); specif.,<br />
to sign (one's name) as payee on the back of (a check, money order, etc.)<br />
to make (a check, etc.) payable to another person by thus signing one's name and specifying the payee<br />
<br />
I take that as conclusive evidence.<br />
<br />
<br />

You obviously have never been a part of any E-Sport such as CS, Starcraft, WoW now with its Arena's or any other gaming organization. Ever hear of the CGS? Sponsors = paid. Getting paid to play doenst always constitue money changing hands. It can be through computers, accessories, fees to play the game waved. I am sure some of them get paid to play. Probably the oldest members , like kungen, etc. Get involved in e-sports , which is a big deal to a lot of people then come try to talk to me about it. <br />
<br />
If I personally had to guess it, I would say the leaders from the merged teams would get paid , everyone else gets accessories (mouses, etc) and their game time paid for. At least I gave some sort of evidence in my agrument. All you can give like the whiney , arguing bitch you are is &quot;they dont get paid&quot;... where is your counter proof? Thats right bitch. You dont have any.</div></div><hr />

Indeed there is. No doubt Ensidia will get that first too.<br />

I fail to see how using a buff to help you kill a boss is in any way shape or form cheating.<br />
<br />
BLIZZARD PUT IT IN THE GAME !!!<br />
<br />
If your too dumb enough to think of solutions to help your guild kill bosses. Then poor you. But to call others cheating for using their brains is a pretty low thing to do tbh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Easy Tiger.<br />
<br />
I have changed my text a bit then i hope it's ok, because i don't think it was cheat, I was only trying to make a point on when going for world first, and getting blocked by a change by blizz, then i would do the same they did and to get over it.</div></div><hr />

The only sponsors ensidia has are for their community website, no player gets payed.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know several tards who live in the UK who play wow 24/7 and live (quite well) off government programs. They haven't worked since wow classic came about and him and his wife just game all day long.<br />
<br />
Whether that means with a little sponsorship to float your website and buy some hardware that you're &quot;paid to play&quot; or not it does bring up an interesting disparity between US and EU servers where US people don't have the luxury of a huge social system unless they're on dissability or come home missing limbs from one of our many wars.<br />
<br />
not sure what my point is anymore.. but if they're paid anything - then they're paid to play. whether or not the EU social systems fill in the gap to make it liveable is i guess where i'm coming from.</div></div><hr />

There are other characters too that have this.. maybe it's something only available in europe and that's why our links don't show it??? or could it be a buff'd item given to them by sponsors and such to have the edge and make their sponsored team all the more better and beat things quicker???

Pls guys...i hope you dont really think they get ingame stuff just coz they are Ensidia</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syrda</div><div class="date">2009-05-19, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">radius, these are probably hard mode loots which only very few players have obtained so far. The armory is known to be quite slow on updating newly dropped items from time to time. Since only very few guilds have killed Mimiron hard for example the items exclusive to that version of the encounter might not be on the armory yet and therefore do not display in the character sheets.<br />
<br />
The Druid's weapon is Dreambinder (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45613), according to the armory's item ID (http://eu.wowarmory.com/item-info.xml?i=45613). It has only recently been added to Freya's Hard Mode 25 loot in addition to Algalon 25 (see this news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=54201.0)) and is not on the armory yet, although various peolpe probably have it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skip</div><div class="date">2009-05-19, 07:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I usually don't get myself involved in such topics ... and actually i don't play anymore so i don't really care that much, but i find it amusing that some people think that:<br />
<br />
a)Blizzard will in any way intentionally help a guild get a kill on a boss by giving them weapons or any other help (increasing the timer on Algalon etc). It does not benefit them in any way to do that kind of stuff. Ensidia will not stop playing if they don't get all world firsts, there are no people that will start playing WoW just because Ensidia gets a world first ... it is actually more likely some will find it boring that the race is so predictable and quit. So they should not really care who gets world firsts on any boss as long as it is fair and within the rules.<br />
<br />
b)Why would anyone pay people to play WoW? PvE players rarely go on any events and there is next to no benefit from sponsoring a guild. Of course paying for the website and keeping the profits from it is quite sensible, that will also include paying the people working on the website, which could also be a part of the guild. Not to mention that the best guilds play seriously for 1-2 months a year and rest of the year, which is not a sound investment if you put them on a salary. Also note: there are no ads on Ensidia's website so i am quite unsure if it makes any profit. Of course i might be wrong and there is a way to make money out of sponsoring a PvE guild so if you can enlighten me. <br />
<br />
Oh and another thing - there are only 2 sponsored guilds as far as i know - Irae AoD (sponsored by Tera Gaming) and Ensidia. SK, Mousesports, Excello all backed out of the PvE scene - why would they do that if it was so profitable?<br />
<br />
c)Even if they do get payed what does it matter? They won't be the first professional gamers out there and will not be the last. If someone has the money and is willing to pay them for playing i don't see why they should decline. It is like any other sport - i enjoy playing basketball 4-5 hours per week, but i don't hold a grudge against Kobe Bryant for making tons of money out of what I (and million others) consider only a hobby.</div></div><hr />

As mentioned, the ring is a quest reward from Algalon's &quot;head&quot;, the Reply-Code (you can see he got it from the screenshots) and his weapon is Dreambinder (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45613), Freya 25 Hard (and supposedly Algalon 25, too) and Cat BiS, which I know was in the Armory before, don't know why it doesn't work right now.</div></div><hr />

Where exactly? The only thing that resembles advertising on their website are the links to Facebook, Twitter, Myspace, Armory and WWS on the bottom of each page ... i kind of doubt that will cover for paying all their members. Irae AoD have 10 times more advertisement on their website so did Inner Sanctum when they were part of Excello and i can assure you members of IS were never paid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few things to remember though are:<br />
<br />
1. Blizz may not give out items to help them stay #1 but they certainly let them be involved in a considerable amount of beta testing of hard modes that gave them an edge. Other guilds were involved in this process to some extent but clearly they didn't walk into Ulduar with wide eyes and rumors to guide them on patch day.<br />
<br />
2. Being the top guild in the world means that they have absolutely no time for people with crappy computers, flakey connections, UI's that need constant resetting, or anything resembling a comittment to anything but WoW. I won't go as far as saying that they do not have fun and interact in a social manner but certainly personality takes a back seat to cold blooded gaming dedication. If you get into Ensidia don't expect your dipshit friend to get in on your recomendation no matter how funny and friendly they are.<br />
<br />
3. Having All of the 25 man content on farm since the first week of WotLK has given them plenty of time to have insanely geared alts. The 1 hour per reset for Algalon isn't as much of an obstacle if you can beat hard modes with alts and have 10 seperate raid ID's cleared to him on normal mode.<br />
<br />
4. Ever heard of a private server? Doesn't count for the kill but sure helps to practice before the kill.<br />

Ensidia receive financial support from a sheik out of the UAE.* <br />
<br />
There is a little bit of a difference between being a professional sports person and professional gamer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bah i am starting to sound like a fanboi, but one last attempt to clarify:<br />
<br />
SK Gaming is a professional gaming organization that sponsors all kinds of e-sport players. They used to sponsor the guild originally known as Curse during Sunwell, but SK Gaming are in no way currently affiliated with Ensidia, which means SK does not sponsor Ensidia.<br />
<br />
So my point was: How come organizations such as SK Gaming, MyM, Excello and Mousesports, whose main purpose is sponsoring e-sport teams and players, decided to back out off sponsoring PvE guilds in WoW, but a sheik out of UAE finds it a worthy investment? I don't know about you, but my logic finds it weird that organizations, that are sponsored by companies such as Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Steelseries and a bunch of other IT-companies, find it not profitable to sponsor a PvE guild, but a sheik out of UAE sees a reason to.<br />
<br />
Of course i can be wrong and they could be sponsored, but then why would they keep it a secret? I think it might just add up to their image and broaden their recruitment pool. At least when i was playing i would certainly have done a lot to be able to get paid for it. Weird enough in the conventional e-sports ( WoW PvE is kind of different)most of the best players play for clans/teams that get paid and funnily enough those teams/clans tend to win most of the time.<br />
<br />
Finally to clarify my sports methaphore (sp) - all i meant is that there is nothing weird for people, that excel in their field, to get paid for doing what other people might consider a hobby. Of course when it comes to sports the talent and determination required for success is much bigger, but so are the profits. And if that seems too far fetched of a comparison for WoW - you can even take other games such as WC3 and CS, out of which quite a lot of people have made a living and I am yet to see an angry mob running after Grubby screaming &quot;How dare you get paid for playing a game!?!?&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The thing you are missing is that this sheik don't have to find it &quot;an worthy investment&quot;. He can very well do it just because he enjoys is. These sheiks got enough money to use $100 bills as toiletpaper.<br />
<br />
There's no doubt that a shik is sponsoring them (whether it's the actuall crown prince or not I do not know) - and looking at their website, I doubt it can be profitable. The question isn't if, but in what way. Just the website? Pay the leaders? Pay the whole team?<br />
<br />
I personally don't know, and also do not give a shit. I don't see why others should either, noone not in ensidia have anything to do with how much money they may or may not get for playing.<br />
Are they beeing paid to play? If so, good for them, I wish I could be paid to do my hobby.</div></div><hr />
