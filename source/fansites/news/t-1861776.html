Dev Interviews<br />
Gamereactor (http://www.gamereactor.eu/news/339523/World+of+Warcraft+Legion+has+been+in+planning+for+years/) recently published an interview from Gamescom. The highlights are below, but be sure to watch the full thing for additional context.<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
The team is never sure if they are giving out too little, enough, or too much information. <br />
When sharing new information, the team has to consider if they are setting themselves up for trouble later on if they end up unable to do something they talked about previously.<br />
They have been trying to tie expansions together better, rather than having disconnected chunks of content. This is why Garrosh led us into Warlords and Gul'dan led us into Legion.<br />
Once the team had settled on the concept of Legion, they couldn't think of a better time to add Demon Hunters. <br />
The Tomb of Sargeras was the anchor for the Broken Isles. The places and cultures related to it were then considered. The Tomb was a temple to Elune, surrounded by Night Elf civilization. That felt like a good direction to go, especially after all of the Orcs.<br />
The complaints about Orcs didn't go unheard, but the team knew a change of pace was coming with Legion. <br />
The art team does a great job of designing art that captures the fantasy of each expansion. This time, there was the expansion reveal art, Illidan fighting Gul'dan, and some more art for Blizzcon. All of this art together defines the iconic look for the expansion. <br />
The team is looking at all of the player feedback to see what players are most excited about and affirming that they are on the right track. <br />
<br />
<br />
Development Timeline<br />
<br />
Legion had been worked on for over a year before the announcement.<br />
The idea for Legion is several years old. The team was planning out several expansions and trying to decide the order of Legion and Warlords of Draenor back in 2012.<br />
There were already two zones in production at last year's Gamescom. <br />
The team is already well in process on the expansion after Legion. <br />
The internal alpha is still ongoing at the office in preparation for beta.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quantity and Quality of Content<br />
<br />
Subscriber numbers will always fluctuate. The team tries to focus on making sure that players are happy, having fun, and excited about the game. <br />
When players feel like the team isn't doing a good enough job delivering content, the rate of content being added, the quality of content being added, or the type of content being added, that is what the team will focus on. <br />
There are a lot of things that influence subscriber numbers and some of them aren't under Blizzard's control. <br />
It is hard to look at World of Warcraft and say that the game isn't big enough or doesn't have enough stuff. It is a question of how the team uses the existing stuff, how replayable things are, how the progression and reward systems line up to create a satisfying experience, are players social enough, is there a good mix of single player and social activities. The way content is used is more important than the quantity produced.<br />
The team is committed to quality, but it can't come at the expense of quantity and getting things in player's hands. If the team is spending a long time to make something perfect and players are starving for content, that isn't doing the right thing. <br />
The team needs to give players a reason to keep playing the content that they enjoy, as well as giving them more to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Progression<br />
<br />
Progression is a huge part of the game. When progression is done well, the game does better and people are happier and having more fun. <br />
Players often say they have the most fun during the start of the expansion when there is so much to do. After that the progression options narrow, as the main focus is on increasing your item level. Artifacts are an alternative path that keep things interesting and relevant. <br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Please stop making digsites that are split in 2. Make them one big area, because this kind of thing...<br />
FYI, this is a bug that is new to 6.2.2 - definitely not intended. http://t.co/fgy6KA7YAj (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/639602830710435840))<br />

Are shipyard equipment plans now account wide? My most recent arrival in tanaan seems to have some unexpectedly unlocked.<br />
They are indeed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/639942093520027649))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
I really have hard time believing that throwing money at artists won't solve the art issue. Even with high standards ..<br />
Recruiting is a slow process as long as you value your company culture. Money can only speed that up so much. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/639805155165081600))<br />

<br />
They've done that for years now. It's not really impressive anymore, just expected.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of hearing nothing about Legion though, I want to hear what else we'll be doing, what other features and content will there be? So far it's more or less the same as WoD, with less Garrison crap and more monotonous grinding for the Artifact. Like yeah the traits will be cool and all, but it's not going to last me a year or two, and if they TRY to stretch it out for the entire expansion, about 99% of players will end up getting bored and burnt out of leveling the damn thing, especially when you have to level 2-4 of them if you want all your specs to have their maxed Artifacts too.<br />
<br />
<br />
When sharing new information, the team has to consider if they are setting themselves up for trouble later on if they end up unable to do something they talked about previously.<br />
<br />
Oh, did they finally realize that all the hyped up bullshit for Warlords that never got added didn't work? Yeah you sold ~10M copies, then you lost half your playerbase in a measly 6 months, and you got another 6-12 months to go until your next expansion drops with ZERO content being added in between that time period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and hype train for legion not only died by started to rot - this sentence means legion will be exact same shit as wod - they said exact same thing about wod and how did it end up ? utter shit.<br />
<br />
instead spend next year polishing legion and adding content to it they will be misguiding everybody with elusive &quot;we work on next expansion already&quot; - nobody cares about next expansion we care about legion so it doesnt end up being complete garbage like wod.<br />
<br />
<br />
When players feel like the team isn't doing a good enough job delivering content, the rate of content being added, the quality of content being added, or the type of content being added, that is what the team will focus on. <br />
<br />
hahahahaa bull f.... s.... - we have been telling them for past 3 years about dungeons and we didnt get any new after launch<br />
<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things that influence subscriber numbers and some of them aren't under Blizzard's control. <br />
<br />
ye duh ofc there is and main this which influences it in wod is absolute total lack of content</div></div><hr />

<br />
I realize there's concept art, ideas, lore stuff, etc. that is being fleshed out now for the post-legion expansion. But I also remember that a lot of content got cut from Warlords so that it could be released in a timely manner and then they tell us that many people were already working on Legion before Warlords release. People that could've helped keep that Warlords content in?<br />
<br />
I've lost a lot of faith. My concern is that Legion will come out with like 80% of what we expected, we'll get a patch or two and then sit back and wait for the next expansion again. When they said t hey wanted faster expansions I thought that meant the big gap between the last content patch and the next xpac was going to shrink. I didn't think they'd just cut out a bunch of content and just leave that gap there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They´ve already confirmed during last Blizzcon interviews, that they are heading into 2-patch expansions rather than do 4 patches. They´ve said that making another raid will take 10 months of time and that will slow down development of the next expansion. So We will wait 14 months or more for another content if there will be 4 patch expansion. It´s sad but true</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I don't understand is why it's still taking an obscene amount of time to release the next expansion though. If Legion is to be assumed a Q1 release, that's ~7-9 months after Patch 6.2, and if it's a Q2 release, that's ~10-12 months!<br />
<br />
PS: There's no way for a Q4 2015 release. You're on drugs if you think it's happening, or it'll be VERY rushed and unfinished (even moreso than WoD was).</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I'd be okay with that if those patches had a bit more substance. Patch 6.1 and 6.2 weren't very impressive. I'd also be okay if there wasn't the huge gap between expansions. I &quot;finished&quot; Tanaan Jungle within a month. I haven't downed Hellfire Citadel on every difficulty or collected every single battle pet and achievement, but those aren't really what I'm looking for. I like doing the pets and achievements on the side when waiting in queue.<br />
<br />
In previous expansions Alts were what usually kept me going at this point. But I don't even have fun doing those anymore. The artifacts in Legion might make me more interested in playing my alts though.</div></div><hr />

What lesson? They have been doing the same thing ever since WoW was launched.<br />
<br />
The negativity on these forums is getting beyond depressing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me this is the most worrying quote I can take from the above, if this is the general attitude of the current dev team then no wonder so many people are getting disappointed with the game and the content.<br />
<br />
Quality and quantity should really be addressed hand in hand not separate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They repeat pretty much the same shit before each expansion and we end up with 2 filler x-packs now.<br />
<br />
Pandaria was not a filler expansion, it added lots of new features and had lots of content. It's ok to not like its lore, theme or setting, but don't be dumb.<br />
<br />
Let's look at max-lvl content.<br />
<br />
In MoP you got: a race, a class, talent revamp, 2 new BGs and 1 arena, scenarios, Challenge Modes, Pet Battles, Brawlers', 2 end game zones (IoT, TI), major end-game quest chains integrated with story and lore, bonus stuff like the IoT loot run, Zandalari Warbringers or the green fire quests that were minor things, but fun and challenging, raid difficulty revamp + in-game premade tool + between all 3 tiers you had some actual variety in terms of raid design, bosses and setting<br />
<br />
In WoD they took the path of least resistance (with things like Brawlers' - reshuffled bosses, added nothing new, called it a day), as far as new things go, you got the Garrisons (+shipyard, which is the same shit really), Apexis grind areas, 1 &quot;new&quot; endgame zone (Tanaan) and 2 raid tiers with 3 raids, the longest two of which are same shit really: orcs, flames, spikes, guns, tanks, the only difference being that the orcs, flames, spikes, guns and tanks are mostly red-themed in BRF and mostly green in HFC (note, this comes on the tail of a 14-month long raid that had... yes, you guessed it right, orcs, flames, spikes, guns and tanks - but these were BROWN, rather than red/green, so I guess it's all fine). All gameplay was centered around your garrison. Professions? Do them in your garrison. Mats? Get them from the garrison. Raid epics? Garrison. Gold? Garrison. Rares in the world, treasure? Woop dee doo, they drop Garrison Resources. They had no incentive even to run 5-man hcs, then in 6.1 they decided to fix it and give us, wait for it, 200 Garrison Resources as a reward. Splendid.<br />
<br />
Damn, it somehow turned into a rant. Tl;dr - don't compare a content-rich xpac like MoP with a barebones crapfest like WoD, because you're not doing the game any justice whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

They´ve said that making another raid will take 10 months of time and that will slow down development of the next expansion. So We will wait 14 months or more for another content if there will be 4 patch expansion. It´s sad but true<br />
<br />
And you don't think that another expansion (which comes with at least one raid by the way) take way more time than that?? It's utterly braindead choosing to do an entire expansion instead of working on the one you've got, unless of course your sole motivation is money.</div></div><hr />

so long as 7.2 is comparable to 6.2 in size and 7.1 is ~2.4/5.1/5.3 sized (and introduces new zone/new world content and/or new dungeons) + the last tier wait is ~8 months instead of 12+ months then Im fine with 2 patch expansions</div></div><hr />

Pandaria was not a filler expansion, it added lots of new features and had lots of content. It's ok to not like its lore, theme or setting, but don't be dumb.<br />
<br />
Let's look at max-lvl content.<br />
<br />
In MoP you got: a race, a class, talent revamp, 2 new BGs and 1 arena, scenarios, Challenge Modes, Pet Battles, Brawlers', 2 end game zones (IoT, TI), major end-game quest chains integrated with story and lore, bonus stuff like the IoT loot run, Zandalari Warbringers or the green fire quests that were minor things, but fun and challenging, raid difficulty revamp + in-game premade tool + between all 3 tiers you had some actual variety in terms of raid design, bosses and setting<br />
<br />

The Premade Group Finder was part of Warlords, not Mists of Pandaria</div></div><hr />

They've done the exact same thing on every expansion ever released. It's nothing new. They don't announce things until they have something to show, and they won't have something to show until they're about halfway done. If they announced any sooner they wouldn't have any idea about what features they're actually adding and couldn't show of any new zones because there was no artwork yet.</div></div><hr />

premade groups was added somewere in vanila or burning crusade expansion, blizzard only changed button position and ui, and btw during pandaria many people used oQueue addon or open raid web page. oqueue no more working due blizzard changes in draenor.<br />

<br />
When they say they're already well into development on the next expansion, it worries me a bit that they're going to cut Legion short too.<br />
<br />
I realize there's concept art, ideas, lore stuff, etc. that is being fleshed out now for the post-legion expansion. But I also remember that a lot of content got cut from Warlords so that it could be released in a timely manner and then they tell us that many people were already working on Legion before Warlords release. People that could've helped keep that Warlords content in?<br />
<br />
I've lost a lot of faith. My concern is that Legion will come out with like 80% of what we expected, we'll get a patch or two and then sit back and wait for the next expansion again. When they said t hey wanted faster expansions I thought that meant the big gap between the last content patch and the next xpac was going to shrink. I didn't think they'd just cut out a bunch of content and just leave that gap there.<br />
<br />
Pretty clear that's their new gameplan. 12-18 month expansions with only 1 content patch, so they can charge $50 more often to milk their dwindling subs, not to mention the boost of subs they get from expansions. Then they phrase it as if they listened to community feedback wanting faster expansions... when no, no one asked for $50 expansions every year with only 1 patch, they asked for the last patch of an expansion not to take 1+ year with no new content.</div></div><hr />

This ^ is the understatement of the expansion. Losing 45% of your player base in less than a year and calling it a fluctuation is like calling the Titanic a dingy or merely a ship. I genuinely hope the game turns around and does well in Legion but also really wish the devs would stop blowing smoke up their rears with this notion of mere fluctuations. That big of a drop reflects systemic problems with the game and recognizing that problem is half the battle of righting this ship.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You miss out on the fact that before expansion there were like 7 mln people playing so Wow lost maybe 2 milions which is not 45% loss but much less than 30%. You cannot count temporary peaks like during release of new expansion as (like first 3-6 months) it is always only temporary rise that happens during every expansion release. If you count base of players at new expansion release then after Wotlk all expansions must have been awful because player base decreased a lot after each. <br />
<br />
I would rather keep to that this game is old and old games always loose active players. Just how many 10+ year old games do you have that you still play at least once a month? I doubt there is any or it is just wow. I think that Wow served long for an old game but now its time to step down and lets hope that this motivates Blizzard to come out with a new, fantastic mmorpg in near time and changing wow to f2p at same time. You may refresh old thing a lot of times and modify it but you need new model sometimes to make new things possible.</div></div><hr />

dunno what patterns, they talk about artifact weapons like its something awesome new refreshing bla bla bla...its basically ring 2.0, just endless grind because you have to do it, its not optional at all. Dont expect any new stories in old world, the way they talk about stuff like &quot;adventure mode&quot; it seems it will be like we have these quest givers from 6.1, you know that shit that asks you to kill some elite with 2 friends? Reward? Gold...expect shit like that. They might recycle more old dungeons and salami timewalking even more, MoP timewalking event with scaled hp and dmg, woohoo so exciting...i bet the artifact &quot;questline&quot; will similar crap like &quot;invasion&quot; of tanaan, few quests and nothing.</div></div><hr />

Any hopes of more content than WoD were shattered for me with that comment. To be honest I would rather pay for content patches and have more of a progression path to the big bad and more of a story line. There is to much reinventing with each &quot;expansion&quot;.</div></div><hr />

You bring up a great point, 14 months of drought at the end of MOP had better player retention than 6 months of WoD. Think about that.<br />
<br />
Also your argument is dumb, sure they had 7 mil in MoP, THEN they had 10 million, after that the lost 4.5 mil, thats 45% DROP. By your asinine logic we should never count sub increases either, as they may be temporary.<br />

and hype train for legion not only died by started to rot - this sentence means legion will be exact same shit as wod - they said exact same thing about wod and how did it end up ? utter shit.<br />
<br />
instead spend next year polishing legion and adding content to it they will be misguiding everybody with elusive &quot;we work on next expansion already&quot; - nobody cares about next expansion we care about legion so it doesnt end up being complete garbage like wod.<br />

<br />
<br />
hahahahaa bull f.... s.... - we have been telling them for past 3 years about dungeons and we didnt get any new after launch<br />

Don't twist things around bud. That poll was at the very beginning of 2014, right after Ghostcrawler left Blizzard and it stated if people wanted to keep seeing his tweets for a few more months. Now, are you surprised that the majority of people said yes after he left? They probably wanted to know what was going on, see if he had any bad blood with Blizzard or just find out what happened. This is almost 2 years later now, why on EARTH do we need to know what Ghostcrawler says at this point? He's been with Riot for a while now, there's absolutely no point anymore to the average WoW player.<br />
<br />
If you care about what Ghostcrawler has to say, simply follow him on Twitter, or bookmark his Twitter. Otherwise, why are we still getting his tweets all over the front page when he's been out of Blizzard for a while now and they initially said it would be for a few months? I can't link yet, but just search &quot;Ghostcrawler lead designer riot mmochampion&quot; on Google and click the first result, the poll is in that article specifically saying &quot;for the next few months&quot;, not years.</div></div><hr />

They have NOT been doing the same thing since the game launched. They were not working on Cata when they were still working on Wrath - they were 100% focused on Wrath. <br />
<br />
They have changed their production method, and in a way that's concerning to a lot of people - it's not being negative just for the sake of being negative, like so many of you like to claim, in an effort to dismiss anything you don't like to hear.<br />
<br />
What I got from that is, they split their efforts on WoD and Legion - and WoD suffered for it. They're doing the same on Legion - and they have set up Legion to be an expansion as big, lore-wise, as Wrath - but it's probably going to be another unfocused, unfinished, shallow experience because half the team is working on the next expansion, not THIS one - and all for their self-made goal of an expansion every year, which nobody really wanted. If they took two years per expansion, but spread out content patches equally throughout that 24 month period, NOBODY would complain. Another raid would add 10 months? In a two year expansion cycle, like they did up through MoP, that would be FINE - but this idiotic yearly schedule is going to kill the game - we're watching it happen.<br />
<br />
But you go ahead and dismiss it with a wave of your hand and demonize what I said as &quot;just negativity&quot;.<br />

People that think this are the same ones that don't realize that WotLK wouldn't have come out as soon as it did if it wasn't being worked on while BC was being put out.<br />
<br />
Which is irrelevant. Now, if they had been working on TBC before it shipped, alongside Wrath, you might have a point, but they did'nt, and you don't.</div></div><hr />

And that is what makes WoW different from other mmos, it evolves to make it have different things to do. <br />
<br />
If anyone here has played FFXIV and then the xpac till 60. You would know that FFXIV rehashed the same end game again. Bounties, grind for a new tome and then the raid is the same raid just split into turns or floors or....spaghetti.<br />
<br />
WoW in BC had a way to get stuff through heroics and then it had the justice to spend. It also then had 10 man raids for small guilds but as a person from a small guild it was almost impossible to bridge the gap to 25 mans. Then in WotLK they did the vault which was great for catching up, then I missed out on cata but I know in panda they did the LFR. The game adds and adds but at the end of the day at least it is something different. I left FFXIV because I had played at level 50 for so long, that doing the same exact grind again was boring. For newer players, at least they have a whole game to play and explore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They announced they were working on MoP when cata launched, too. They were working on TBC when Classic launched. They were working on Wrath when TBC launched. (Also remember when they said AN was going to be an entire underground zone instead of two tiny instances? They've always cut major content.)<br />
<br />
It has always been this way. And Blizz isn't the only company that does this. Mines of Moira was being worked on when Lotro was still in beta. <br />
<br />
Of course they're working on the next expansions. They have to narrow down the story they want to tell and the basic zones. They probably have a big wall of ideas they're narrowing down into a feature set. They probably know what the continent looks like, maybe even the zone breakdown, but they probably haven't done more than basic work on the zones yet. They've also said they have general ideas for many expansions, it's just a matter of what they decide to do next.<br />
<br />
Each developer has a specific job set. Developers working on certain parts of an expansion (story, concepts etc) need to do something when their job on, say Legion, is done. So they get to work on the next expansion. They are not taking away developers from Legion, they are retasking the developers who's jobs are already done and I'm sure they pull them back if they need to. They probably won't go into serious production on the expansion after Legion until Legion has launched. That doesn't mean they can't work on concepts and storylines etc etc. They've been trying to tell stories better, so of course they need to write the stories well ahead of time to make sure everything adds up and doesn't contradict each other.<br />

I'm sure you'll be saying that it's a good idea when Legion is a disappointment and they use the excuse &quot;Well half the team were working on [Insert next expansion name here]. By the way we're announcing our next expansion which will be released soon! :D&quot; <br />

As for that last paragraph, unless you work within an AAA games studio, I fail to see how you can claim &quot;they do this&quot; or &quot;they do that&quot;.

<br />
These companies have to work on stuff ahead of time or it'll never get done in a timely manner. And then they STILL miss deadlines. The only experience I have is with the Isengard server for lotro, which was an invite only test server that was essentially a F&amp;F alpha for live game content. Saw plenty of stuff cut because it didn't work or they couldn't get it to work, watched them work on stuff that was well ahead of when it was eventually released, etc. I can't imagine Blizz not having an internal server and team working on content ahead of time.<br />
<br />
Of course the funny thing, even with the internal server, isengard, and the public test server, plenty of terrible bugs still made it to live. So it's not just blizzard that breaks stuff, I've never played an MMO that didn't have this problem.<br />
<br />
So they have a large team. Large teams are impossible to manage without breaking down into smaller teams. LIke say, a small team doing prelim work on another expansion. Which they've talked about before, like how their concept artists need things to do, so they start working on another expansion. And since someone needs to give them direction there's got to be something written down by someone about what the general focus is going to be.<br />
<br />
When Cata was announced you can damn well bet their concept artists were working on MoP.<br />

<br />
Since when was I white knighting? Blizzard has done plenty of stupid shit. I just don't agree that having people working on a post-legion expansion is a bad thing and they've had a history of doing this.<br />
<br />
I think there's a fundamental misunderstanding about what 'working in the expansion after legion' actually means. Like I doubt they're coding or doing any major art assets or anything that takes away from Legion. <br />
<br />
At this stage they're in the 'what do we want to do' stage and the story writing stage. Probably concept art. A big board of ideas. Brainstorming, etc.<br />
<br />
Which is what they have always done.</div></div><hr />

They are literally doing the exact same as they did with WoD, said they were working on it prior to the previous expansion whilst claiming beta was soon, actually only started work on it prior to the release of the last patch of MoP and then beta wasn't even started until half a year later and wasn't stable or ready until after WoD have been released for a week.

<br />
Except in the same interview they said how they differentiate between working on and planning. Now I do not doubt that prior to WoD, and maybe even Mop, that the Blizzard Devs sat down and circle jerked up some expansion concepts which may have amounted to no more than Illidan kicks Gul'dan's and the Legion's collective ass with the players and neither do I doubt that during development they aim to flesh out the plot more however in no way do I believe that they have been working on Legion for a year with how much chaff they spouted last year about problems with WoD's development after it supposedly had been in 'development' since before MoP released and the fact even now with their announcement of Legion they are still answering with we don't know or are being evasive when discussing key features of the expansion. Because honestly if it took them a year to hork up WoD and Legion had been in development for a year (with the 'new and trained' devs and having supposedly learned from prior expansions) before the announcement shouldn't there be something more concrete than another WoD-like pitch (&quot;You get Orcs, Warlords, Draenor, Savage, legendary rings and umm... Garrisons! With all these features! Uhh screw it you'll learn more of what's coming in beta.&quot;) of &quot;You get Demon Hunters, Illidan, Legion, another continent, a bunch of weapons for the whole expac and uhhhh... Class Halls that are like Garrisons but aren't? and... uh screw it learn more at Blizzcon.&quot;</div></div><hr />

That poll was at the very beginning of 2014, right after Ghostcrawler left Blizzard and it stated if people wanted to keep seeing his tweets for a few more months. Now, are you surprised that the majority of people said yes after he left? They probably wanted to know what was going on, see if he had any bad blood with Blizzard or just find out what happened. This is almost 2 years later now, why on EARTH do we need to know what Ghostcrawler says at this point? He's been with Riot for a while now, there's absolutely no point anymore to the average WoW player.<br />
<br />
If you care about what Ghostcrawler has to say, simply follow him on Twitter, or bookmark his Twitter. Otherwise, why are we still getting his tweets all over the front page when he's been out of Blizzard for a while now and they initially said it would be for a few months? I can't link yet, but just search &quot;Ghostcrawler lead designer riot mmochampion&quot; on Google and click the first result, the poll is in that article specifically saying &quot;for the next few months&quot;, not years.<br />
<br />
I don't give a shit what he has to say. Which is why I scroll past the posts on here instead of whining about it. You can just choose not to read them. I don't like the crap they post about pvp either but again, scroll past.<br />

That's what they're doing now. They're working on two expansions ahead instead of one. Which is causing the next expansion (was WoD now it's legion) to be shit. This is not hard to understand.

Seriously? You can`t see why and how wrong what you wrote? Let me explain: TBC LAUNCHED and they worked on LK meanwhile, LK launched but they worked on Cata already..Now we have WoD, they ANNOUNCED Legion but they already working on the next after Legion...The next expansion is not even beta, far away from to be released, but they already working on something after it? Really? <br />
Storylines? Have you seen this?: &quot;The idea for Legion is several years old. The team was planning out several expansions and trying to decide the order of Legion and Warlords of Draenor back in 2012.&quot; What kind of storyline is that? Flip a coin which one comes first, then we can rape the other one just to &quot;fit&quot; into a twisted logic!<br />
Not to mention if they working on Legion since a year, then why is most of their answer is: &quot;we don`t know, we still thinking about it, we are not sure about it&quot;?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are one of the first people I've seen dig into it with this logic. My husband has been preaching the same for years now. When Warlords hit, he saw the problems pretty early. We played and raided until a couple months after 6.1. We lost raiders, so we just took a break. We recently rejoined, wanting to get ourselves into Tanaan and to prepare for Legion (early, I know). I've been saying what you quoted for some time. I'm sure there are teams that are mostly done with their parts and fully capable of moving onto the next expansion. However, it is a scary thought that Legion isn't feature complete yet. As my husband puts it, &quot;How can they even be doing art and zones for the expansion after Legion without having every bit done for Legion first?&quot; In his mind, they should have all things finished, even the patch stuff, before they dabble in the next story arc. Mounts, for example, should be all ready to go before an expansion is done. Even if the plan isn't to release some until the last patch, they all should be finished. <br />
<br />
Development takes time, and we want quality expansions with lots of quantity. These gaps in content have to stop, and no expansion should ever be as empty as Warlords.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Beeeeeeecaaaaaaaause the people doing those things maybe aren't the ones who make the mounts? Or the other content? Because they've already finished the art and zones for Legion and need something else to do?<br />
<br />
It's not like every time they need a new night elf building, they hand craft each one from scratch...<br />
<br />
EDIT: I mean, I realise you said you realise there may be teams done with their parts, but if their skill sets are not needed for Legion at the present time, what the fuck do you expect them to be doing while everyone else works on Legion?</div></div><hr />
