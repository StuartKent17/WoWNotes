Valor Points Changes to 4.3 PTR<br />
We've made slight adjustments to the Valor Point (VP) drops on the 4.3 PTR which testers can now see. In both 10- and 25-player raids, bosses will now drop 100 VP each (down from 115 and 135 respectively). We’ll also be changing Firelands raid bosses to drop 50 VP per kill upon release of the patch.<br />
<br />
This change is being made to further emphasize the desire to kill bosses for the items they drop. In the 4.3 raid, tier sets can only be earned from boss drops, and as Raid Finder will allow for just about anyone to get a chance to kill bosses, we think there will be less need for Valor overall. We want to try to match the lower desire for VP with a slightly slower acquisition rate.<br />
<br />
We appreciate your thoughts and constructive discussion on how these changes may affect you and your guild once 4.3 is released.<br />
<br />
<br />
4.3 Battleground Conquest Rewards<br />
In patch 4.3 we’re changing the daily battleground (BG) to reward 100 conquest for a win (up from 25). In addition, every non-rated BG that you win will also give you 50 conquest. There is no limit to how many BGs you can run this way, up to the normal conquest cap.<br />
<br />
Our intent is to start acting even more on our Mists of Pandaria philosophies of encouraging players to approach the content they want to, how they want to, and be able to work toward meaningful player progression. Arenas and rated battlegrounds will still earn Conquest faster, but with this change you can now work your way up by running normal BGs, if you so choose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But yeah. If they really want to slow down the aquisition rate of items-through-Valor points, they'd reduce the weekly cap. Reducing the amount of points per boss kill just forces raiders to use the random LFG tool.<br />
<br />
It's almost like the Conquest and Valor changes contradict each other. Allowing PvPers more options to get their Conquest, then making PvE raiders have to do LFG dungeons over and over to cap if they aren't able to progress through a raid completely in a single lockout.</div></div><hr />

I can totally see that coming. the extra 4 items dropping from each boss are nothing, compared to a currency that will be rendered useless in a month for a weekly raider</div></div><hr />

But I will say that is requires a lot more work to put a 25m together then a 10m. The cap was fine the way it was before. If you were clearing 10m Firelands (7/7) chances are you didn't care if you were 120 VP from cap. More then likely you did a BH anyways for the last VP you needed. The only difference was that 25m raiders didn't have to do BH to cap. Which wasn't a big deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not quite sure what you ask but...<br />
<br />
You don't get saved on bosses, per se, you get saved on lootings. You kill a boss, loot a boss. Then, if you want, you can run the raid again and kill the same boss. You just won't be able to obtain any loot from that kill until the next week. The &quot;save&quot; is per character and not per raid, so anyone who joins you (even if you already cleared the whole raid that week) will still see and obtain loot.<br />
<br />
Also, 10 man is raiding. You should maybe add a &quot;in my [stupid] opinion...&quot; before the sentence.</div></div><hr />

Sigh, if you're only going to bother reading certain things about LFR, then writing a paragraph, should just save yourself some time and look up more info on it.<br />
<br />
You can do new full clears of LFR as many times as you want a week. You get 250 valor for 4/4. You are able to get up to 500 valor this way. The only &quot;lock&quot; that you will receive, is once you have downed a boss, whether you roll on loot or not, you will not be eligible for loot should you down that boss in another LFR.</div></div><hr />

No since the items from the NPC will be overshadowed by those that drop in raod, minus a few rings and maybe cloak. Tier pieces = token only. Look at the facts before posting please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But yeah. If they really want to slow down the aquisition rate of items-through-Valor points, they'd reduce the weekly cap. Reducing the amount of points per boss kill just forces raiders to use the random LFG tool.<br />
<br />
It's almost like the Conquest and Valor changes contradict each other. Allowing PvPers more options to get their Conquest, then making PvE raiders have to do LFG dungeons over and over to cap if they aren't able to progress through a raid completely in a single lockout.<br />
<br />
Yet currently in PvE content you can get the cap entirely from the &quot;lower&quot; tier, being just heroic dungeons.<br />
But in PvP you cannot earn the conquest cap, or even anything remotely close to even the normal heroic dungeon quota from random unrated battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
They are moving closer together rather than further apart.<br />
<br />
A real incentive to win the random battlegrounds instead of substantial numbers farming honor or humping the meters is a nice incentive, even if it is the wrong way to go about it.<br />
Though the real changes needed are ones that blizzard are simply not willing to go through with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
10 man raids are only easier in the sense that you don't need as many people to do one (obviously). A few fights are easier in 10 man as you have more room to maneuver. However, 25 mans are quite a bit more forgiving if you lose people. A lot of times in a 10 man raid, especially learning new fights, if you lose more than one person, it's a wipe. 25s can lose possibly up to 5 people and still kill a boss depending on who those people were and when they died during the fight.<br />
<br />
The reason 25 mans aren't run more often is the work required to put them together and keep them going. Most of the times, fights are easier with 25 people. Why do you think the top guilds run 25 mans over 10 mans?</div></div><hr />

If you're a better player than the person you are going up against it's not going to matter if they are wearing conquest gear like you or just honor gear. You'll still beat them. All it will do is keep you from destroying them in 3 seconds. If you really wanted to be &quot;fair&quot; people with full conquest wouldn't be allowed to do regular bg's. This change allows people to gear up and not feel like they are absolutely destroyed when they step in to BG's which ends up making them not want to do them anymore. It also gives a good alternative to sitting around looking for RBG's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-People don't get saved until they kill bosses since 4.0, I really don't know on what planet you are living on. Plus, the LFR tool has different rules. You can kill a boss multiple times with no problem, but you can only have a shot at the loot on the first kill. So there's no saving, no locking, you just can't loot twice the same boss, that you win or not.<br />

If you went into the nuke phases on Ragnaros, Rhyolith, or Beth'tilac with a single DPS or healer down pre-nerf, it was a wipe. Same with Baleroc, one DPS dead meant you wouldn't make berserk (and would also throw off Torment rotations), and one healer dying would usually be a wipe because their stacks were reset even if they got a battle rez.<br />
<br />
The only boss you could finish with 5 people dead was Alysrazor, as it's almost always a free kill if you make it to the second burn phase (if you even have a second).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
10 man raids are only easier in the sense that you don't need as many people to do one (obviously). A few fights are easier in 10 man as you have more room to maneuver. However, 25 mans are quite a bit more forgiving if you lose people. A lot of times in a 10 man raid, especially learning new fights, if you lose more than one person, it's a wipe. 25s can lose possibly up to 5 people and still kill a boss depending on who those people were and when they died during the fight.<br />
<br />
The reason 25 mans aren't run more often is the work required to put them together and keep them going. Most of the times, fights are easier with 25 people. Why do you think the top guilds run 25 mans over 10 mans?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if you're talking about normal modes or heroic modes. I'm assuming not normal modes since in either raid size, if a person dies the raid can keep on trucking. ;P <br />
<br />
Having done Heroic modes on different characters (so I'm not using a 25-man character to breeze through 10-man content), my personal feel is that 10-man heroics are easier this tier. Last tier, it was a bit ridiculous how some fights were at least initially basically impossible for 10-man, and I think that Blizzard overcompensated by tuning Firelands heroics down. I didn't do Sinestra on 25-man last tier, but in 10-man it seemed that the damage was tuned to be pretty high even mid-to-late T11, and I read a few things that it was a bit more reasonable on 25-man. H Staghelm this tier for instance, although really not that hard of a fight on 10 or 25, nonetheless bothered me when 9 people was sufficient to complete a clean first kill on him. Not 10 people with 1 person dead, but 9 people going in and doing it (pre-nerf). My 25-man group had a bit of trouble avoiding the second orb phase (pre-nerf) even though our DPS relative to the average DPS to kills was in the same ballpark as the 10-man group's average DPS relative to kills.<br />
<br />
A pretty noticeable example from this tier is Heroic Rag. On 10-man, Phases 1-3 are fundamentally the same as they are on Normal. On 25-man, if you don't kill enough Molten Elementals before they reach the raid (assuming you use the clump method, which seems to be the most commonly used method for that phase due to its highest efficiency compared to other approaches), they'll one-shot their target and it's gg. I'm afraid I can't discuss the fight further on 25-man since I haven't seen it in its entirety. However, it is clear to me that just as no one can die on 10-man encounters, a death on 25-man on heroic fights (especially end bosses) doesn't mean the raid can just keep on going and kill the boss.<br />
<br />
A common misconception regarding 25-mans being able to &quot;carry more&quot; is that, well, numerically speaking, it can. A 10-man can afford to carry 1 person, which is 10% of its raid size. 10% of 25 people is 2.5. Since people don't come in halves ;P, let's say 2-3. So yes, a 25-man can carry more, but not a higher percentage. If your contention that a 25-man can carry 5 people, 20% of its raid size, well that's equated to carrying 2 people in 10-man, which 10-mans can do (although not for all fights, just as for 25-mans not being able to carry even 1 person on some fights).<br />
<br />
Your contention over why the top guilds run 25-mans over 10-mans is... well, not sure how to say this without being rude but, presumptuous. ;P I agree that the majority of the WoW population will take the path of least resistance, but I've yet to meet someone who raids 10-mans because it's harder. We can all understand the desire to raid 10-mans because it's less hassle to deal with on the administrative side - let's face it, we play WoW to have fun, not so that we can feel like we're at work and trying to get all our files together. : | The reason that top guilds run 25-mans is that it is faster to get gear that way especially at the get go. Mid to late patch, it doesn't matter as much anymore, but earlier on one week of gear from 25-mans is more than one week of gear from 10-mans. Even though 391 vs 397/403/410/416 doesn't matter that much to a world caliber guild, I think it might help a little. Also, because they are hardcore and creme of the crop players, I think it's reasonable to think that they'd take the harder way to get what they want to achieve, instead of the easy way to get their trophies. Do you remember when Ensidia went 10-man when Cata launched to better their chances of getting world firsts, but unfortunately due to the tuning in T11 it didn't work out for them? I'm betting that not many people remember the amount of ridicule Ensidia got for doing that, not unsimilar to when they moved to Paragon's server to try to snatch up the realm first spam.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to agree with this post. It really seems like they want to stretch the acquisition of gear very, very thin. Just take a look at LFR rules, lol, with those in place, and knowing the RNG, and standard scripting i.e. no shaman in grp, all it drops is shaman lewt, it will be a cold day in Diablo hell before we get any loot. Oh right, the lewt winners will be players who die seconds after boss pull because they were making dinner. Hooray for raiding incentive with zero chance of loot and less VP now.<br />

Why does Blizzard do this? They know people will play one way or the other, why try so hard to make us really start disliking the game? Oh they want us to raid, raid, raid and see end content? Ok, fair enough, but imho this is just another rotten carrot they are dangling in front of us.</div></div><hr />

Actually, the cap has been increased just slightly. Still, your point remains true. I don't see why he should be crying unless he wants DW to be killed within the first month. The same amount of people will quit regardless if he's killed by raids slowly or not.</div></div><hr />

ya,maybe more good pvpers will start doing bgs and horde will actually win more.since you only get conquest points if you win this change is pretty much not all that great for people who play horde since horde is pretty terrible in bgs anyway(you only get conquest points if you win)<br />

<br />
There is no lockout in the sence that you know it from the game now. You can spam run LFR. That said, there is a loot &quot;lockout&quot; which means that if you kill the first 2 bosses you won't be able to get loot from them again before the weekly reset. And this is even though you get loot or not. Like it is now in normal and HC, 1 shot at loot per boss per week.</div></div><hr />

But the 10man vs. 25man... never made sense to give more valor for 25 if they say that 10m = 25m. Both should give the same amount and both should be able to cap.<br />
<br />
The Random BG change was needed (still missing the possibility to do all 7 randoms in a day) as they changed the PvE Valor so much and when you look at the PvP side... it's like doing heroics for something like 10-20 Valor points at the end.<br />
<br />
But didn't get the extra 50 conquest for as many BGs you want to do until you hit the cap. Tought that their goal was to make ppl interested in Rated BGs... since you don't exactly need to get there to get most of the gear (you basically buy everything from a vendor while for PvE, most of it come from the raids), just to increase the cap with higher rating (if you're able)? Weird...<br />
<br />
But I guess it's the same at the end... most don't go to a raid to see end game... they just want purples, so not everyone go for rated/arenas for the sake of competition, titles, etc... they just want their points for purples.<br />

<br />
Actually, my point was, while the Valor Cap will be increased between patches, this announced change does nothing to affect it, as the cap will still be 1000, so if you clear DS (800) and do BH's new boss (100), all you need is either a weekly heroic, or 2 Firelands bosses, or simply settle with 900 for a week, which, again, changes nothing in terms of when you get that valor gear, it will simply require you to play another 30 minutes per day to do an heroic if you so wish.<br />
Funny tho, all these threads &quot;game for casuals, no effort for rewards qq&quot; Blizzard makes you do an extra heroic for gear, &quot;game too grindy, gear harder to get qq&quot;</div></div><hr />

I would think people would compete in RBGs and Arenas for the competition and prestige of being at the top, not the gear. They get the gear quickly now anyway, so there has to be another reason they'd want to do it.</div></div><hr />

Here we have a person who requires an advantage in order to win in PvP. In other words, a baddie. PvP is just that, Player versus Player NOT Player vs. Gear. Conquest change is about 6 years too late. It's long overdue that the ENTIRE PvP community have access to and compete in equal gear all the time. No more not being able to compete because you started a season late or don't play WoW as a job. Good move Blizz.<br />
<br />
Valor change seems...dumb, but then again like they said, it's not about points it's about doing the content (which is now where the gear drops).</div></div><hr />

This bares repeating and has been said fifty thousand times..... should be about skill and you against them, not gear.<br />
<br />
Quickly pointing out here: resilience is NOT being removed from PVP gear in MoP. They're just making resilience a base stat that increases as you level to allow people who are just starting out in PVP content to not get so quickly facerolled. PVP gear will still offer up more resilience for those who have been working to attain it, but the resilience change is meant to make it easier to get started.<br />
<br />
On to the blue posts: I would point out that the cap for VP is up to 1000 on the PTR, if I remember correctly. But no, you don't have to run dungeons to cap your VP. Assuming these valor changes go live, a full clear of Dragon Soul will net accomplished raiders 800 VP. That last 200 can be earned through four-boss jaunt into Raid Finder, or running two random heroics (this includes the easymode release heroics as well); 100 points could also be earned through Alizabal in BH. So no, you won't be able to cap out on VP through raiding alone, but the extra work to cap your VP for the week is minimal. It's about equivalent to the extra work a 10-man guild has to do to cap after a run through FL.<br />
<br />
And I am very happy they made the Conquest change. Those 25 points you earned for one daily BG made it incredibly hard to earn any reasonable amount of Conquest if you weren't well-enough geared to run RBGs, or couldn't find anyone to do arenas with. 100 for your first, and 50 for subsequent wins will make it considerably easier for players who aren't so high on the PVP totem pole to access the higher levels of gear. Granted, it'll still take a good amount of time (11 days of three wins a day just to get a 2200-point item), but the fact that the option is there should make for some happy PVPers.</div></div><hr />

The valor point changes are fine, i already feel you can cap to easily if you are heavy raiding, i mean you can nearly cap with 1 play through on Fire Lands, so i dont mind these changes especially when FL will still give 50 points a boss plus LFR , new raid and the daily dungeons for valor.</div></div><hr />

Now you get trinkets, rings, cloaks, bracers, necklace, wands , relics etc from valor points, the annoying gear that can be a pain to upgrade, while the raids focus more on Tier sets and weapons which in my opinion is the setup they have been going by.</div></div><hr />

Specifically, while most of us spent 4400-6050 on the tier pieces the last two tiers, those will just be regular boss drops now, which is 4-6 weeks less of VP farming right off the bat.<br />
<br />
The tier changes are going to DRASTICALLY speed up gearing in guilds clearing 8/8 weekly. Assuming an even distribution of drops and raid comp, and 25m guild will take 5 weeks to get ALL their raiders T13. This is simply an attempt to bring the DS rate down so that people aren't in full T13 in less than a month. Too high of a gearing rate is a double-whammy on content shortening, as not only does it remove motivation to continue raiding after clearing the end boss, it also means the bosses are going to go down quicker thanks to more gear.</div></div><hr />

Heroics will not give any valor in 4.3<br />
<br />
Ignoring the generic &quot;blizz so greedy&quot; whining, heroics STILL give VP in 4.3. Any random heroic (4.0, 4.1, 4.3) will give you the same amount of valor; I want to say 100 points, but it could be 150. I'd have to double-check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're still not forced to. You could run a RF raid, do a dungeon or two, or kill Alizabal in BH and then cap with a dungeon run. You're not FORCED to cap through dungeons. You do have options.<br />
<br />
And even if you don't cap, is it that big of a deal? 10-man guilds already have to run a dungeon after they've run through FL to cap. And if you don't, you'll just be at 800 of 1000ish. It'd be up to you to determine if that extra 200 points was worth it.</div></div><hr />

With a 1,000 VP cap each week, and only 8 bosses in the Dragon Soul raid, there will be more content you have to do each week to reach your cap. It would be nice to compensate us with 1 more item drop per raid boss (i.e. 10 man 3 items minus a token for those bosses). If not, then we will have to go back and do an old raid when we may not even have time in the week to do so. Also that 800 VP each week is assuming your raid group can get all 8 bosses down each week from launch. There will be a lot of Firelands runs still going on with this new system. I like all of these new changes, but it is getting frustrating seeing how they are changing EVERYTHING up just for a patch. The amount of change in MoP will probably be even more than this one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On to the blue posts: I would point out that the cap for VP is up to 1000 on the PTR, if I remember correctly. But no, you don't have to run dungeons to cap your VP. Assuming these valor changes go live, a full clear of Dragon Soul will net accomplished raiders 800 VP. That last 200 can be earned through four-boss jaunt into Raid Finder, or running two random heroics (this includes the easymode release heroics as well); 100 points could also be earned through Alizabal in BH. So no, you won't be able to cap out on VP through raiding alone, but the extra work to cap your VP for the week is minimal. It's about equivalent to the extra work a 10-man guild has to do to cap after a run through FL.<br />
<br />
And I am very happy they made the Conquest change. Those 25 points you earned for one daily BG made it incredibly hard to earn any reasonable amount of Conquest if you weren't well-enough geared to run RBGs, or couldn't find anyone to do arenas with. 100 for your first, and 50 for subsequent wins will make it considerably easier for players who aren't so high on the PVP totem pole to access the higher levels of gear. Granted, it'll still take a good amount of time (11 days of three wins a day just to get a 2200-point item), but the fact that the option is there should make for some happy PVPers.tbh if you play bg's all day it wont take you 11 days to get 2.2k and u can only get the weekly cap anyway which i think is 1350 or something like that, if your lucky and win nearly all of your bg's in a day you wont be far off being capped if the cap is 1350 then you need to win 270 bg's in that day sounds impossible in a day but over 3 days maybe, but alot of people welcome this like me even if it takes longer id rather do bg's for my points than shitty arena and also you get honor kills towards of the horde and bloodthirsty and im guessing there might be some new pvp achivments in 4.3</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whoever said that has got their wires crossed. In 4.3 you get 10 more valor points per 5 man run *150*. Which is more than now on live. You can do it 7 times a week like usual. So it caps around to a nice 1000 valor points a week. Valor will be used to buy from what I have seen, bracers, off pieces etc. So yeah :)<br />
<br />
On a side note the conquest from random bgs is a nice change. Rated BGs have been a mixed bag for blizzard. Some love it, some hate it. But anyway overall it is for sure a welcome addition</div></div><hr />

<br />
The three new 5 mans will have full sets of gear for each class and spec. So there is actually more PvE gear available, and since the people who need the welfare will be running those dungeons anyway, there is less reason to have such extensive set of badge gear.<br />
<br />
Currently for PvP'er that don't want to be bothered with RBG's or Arena have no reason to continue to run normal BG's once they get a full set of honor gear, because 5 CP's a day doesn't really get you all that much over the course of the season.<br />
<br />
This change does a better job of balancing the rewards between 5 man heroics and normal BG's.<br />
<br />
AFAIK Conquest gear is not heroic level gear anyway. Elite Conquest gear is what I consider heroic level gear and it all requires rating.</div></div><hr />

On topic| welfare gear or not, both are good changes. 25 conquest for doing a bg a day as a non-paper was incredibly boring and gave me no incentive to bother going into BGs. Now at 50 each win I will actually want to go in there. And after Firelands where most of our gear came from valor vendors, running Firelands and getting boring drops all the time or drop that aren't as good as valor gear was a waste of time and space. <br />
It's still going to be easy to cap VP with 3 dungeons and then 2 LFR runs and BH, but those that are in raid guilds will find their gear is better from drops than from the vendor</div></div><hr />

At that point, it's about maximizing item gains, and 25mans have a huge advantage in that regard, both in terms of drops per person and a smaller chance that dropped gear will be wasted (int mail dropping with no shaman in the raid...sigh).</div></div><hr />

Previously there was equal loot, though more loot per person, and more Valor points.<br />
Now though...<br />

Thank you... someone else other than me is seeing the problem....<br />
<br />
Give me one good reason to even bother staying in a 25m guild?<br />
This thing will be thought of many of the current 25m-guild-people.<br />
<br />
You got 2 GMs<br />
<br />
1 is a 10m-guilds GM<br />
1 is a 25m-guilds GM<br />
<br />
Wich one of these 2 are working the hardest to survive as a guild ?<br />
<br />
Blizzard really f***ed 25m guilds with this content.<br />
<br />
Noone cried when you got 277s from 25m HC and 264 from 10m HC... I thought it was fair, and yes, i was in a 10m-guild by then. Why they changed it is... out of my ability to even think off..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Valor change, on the other hand, I'm feeling mixed about. Normalizing 10/25 vp gains is unnecessary, in my opinion, but not a deal-breaker. I think they ought to have decreased slightly the VP cost to go along with it because heroics are such a hassle.</div></div><hr />

The 25 conquest per BG was just pathetic. However, they should make it 7 times a week you get 100 conquest, then 50 after that to match up with how VP in dungeons is handed out. Personally I'm fine running a few heroics a week to max out VP. I'm fine doing it in a pug, and I'm fine if it takes an hour (or more) to get the dungeon done. The only time I've left a dungeon early was because I was needed to do raiding. Every other time, the &quot;poor&quot; players quit first and we get better replacements.</div></div><hr />

Why would the raider want to cap valor? The tier pieces won't be purchasable -- only boss drops.<br />

I see so many comments like this that demonstrate complete utter lack of comprehension of math.<br />
<br />
3-4 failures in 10-man = 7-9 failures in 25-man. Guess what? You can't have that there either.<br />
<br />
The other day I saw a 10-man person QQ about how 25-mans can carry 5 people but 10-mans can't, 10-mans should be made equal so it can carry 5 people also.<br />
<br />
Oh, ok, so you want 10-man to be tuned so that it can carry HALF of its size? Cool. But you'd complain if 25-mans were tuned the same and carried 12 (not even half) of its people because 12&gt;5!!!!<br />
<br />
5 people in 25-man = 20%, 20% of 10 people = 2 people. 10-mans can carry 2 people. I've seen it, I've done it.<br />

It's the same system as with random dungeons, if you want all your weekly cap in one day, you can, but with slower rate. And btw what's the difference when you get your conquest with random or with 2v2 unbalanced arena matches?!?</div></div><hr />

I know about this already. Just curious if it was the opinion of 10-man guilds that this is the ONLY reason that 25-mans go 10-mans, with nothing else at all. Also, if you want less organization, why are there guilds running 2-3 10-mans instead of 25-mans for H Rag and stuff?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But yeah. If they really want to slow down the aquisition rate of items-through-Valor points, they'd reduce the weekly cap. Reducing the amount of points per boss kill just forces raiders to use the random LFG tool.<br />
<br />
It's almost like the Conquest and Valor changes contradict each other. Allowing PvPers more options to get their Conquest, then making PvE raiders have to do LFG dungeons over and over to cap if they aren't able to progress through a raid completely in a single lockout.<br />
<br />
I agree, the general theme though is to force all of the players to utilize the random group tools, be they for pve and pvp. I strongly disagree with this sort of movement. Adding in convenience is fine, forcing people to use that tool is an entirely different matter. The real life equivalent is for the government to add in a network of busses that literally service everywhere in the country, and then ban the usage of cars on freeways and highways. Now individuals have lost the option to travel at their own pace and are forced to share a ride with a bunch of strangers which most of the time they would have rather not of met. Not to mention wait for the service to actually service them and to have to accommodate by the luggage rules of the bus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People like you make me curious. If you Pvp for reward, shouldnt the motivation be to be competitive?<br />
<br />
Easier gear closes the gear gap. Less gear gap means a more even playing field. The more gear is normalized, the more skill is enforced (within comp).<br />
<br />
If you only Pvp for the shiny gear, you can do that. If you enjoy Pvp to prove you are better than others based on skill, this should be welcome.<br />
<br />
who cares if Pvp gear is easier to obtain, both casuals and hardcore benefit from this directly.<br />
The only people who this hurts are the wannabes. You know, the people who claim to love pvp for the challenge, but whine when challenge can occur.<br />
<br />
You know, cuz anyone at a respectable level of pvp will have this gear anyways, right?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dYnkYn</div><div class="date">2011-11-18, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And that 4-6 weeks shaved off could turn into you spending the next year never getting ANY of those tier pieces, just ask the people raiding the entirety of vanilla and never seeing a drop they needed. The valor system was put in to specifically prevent that RNG from destroying people's desire to raid, and now they bring that right back, at the worst subscriber loss in WoW history, great move. Welcome to RNG, enjoy crying over it in a few months.<br />
<br />
Oh, and by the way, Priest healers have 7 of their BiS items off valor come 4.3, so they aren't saving any time.<br />
<br />
for sûre, valor stuff will be better than heroic gear... <br />
moreover, the head and the shoulder were not rng ? seriously it's one of the worst comment here !<br />
<br />
and for the qq about &quot;blizz is killing 25&quot; just keep in mind that rng is better for 25 as there are more loots : you are less likely to never see YOUR LOOT. Example : you are the last one without your t13 head. You are more likely to see it in 25 than in 10. That's why it's faster to stuff a raid in 25 than in 10.</div></div><hr />

Which is truly a grind that would take most players the whole week of quite a few hours a day, meaning most would still end up only half capped before it reset for the week, since they dont even like pvp enough to form a real rbg team.</div></div><hr />

maybe normal modes, but a majority of the HC fights 10 man is harder.<br />
<br />
rofl - possibly the least informed comment I have seen here in some time. I've done both, and without a doubt coordinating and killing in 25HM is more difficult. It is not even a close call.<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't get the part community and guild culture plays in their own game. We've been on the same server raiding end game for over five years. 10 person guilds come and go with no staying power (with rare exceptions granted). And, there are fewer and fewer quality 25 person guilds because of the illusion that 10 person raids are somehow more fun. They aren't. <br />
<br />
The result is that guilds who have been around as long as us are a dying breed, and keeping players is harder than ever before.<br />
<br />
Whatever they wanted to happen, this is the result and I think it is sad. I play this game as a hobby with people I have met in game and have known for years. Why do anything to mess the sort of brand loyalty this sort of community creates? Dollars is the short answer...and I guess that is why it will not change.</div></div><hr />

Lol, awesome. IKR? Actually, maybe they can scrounge up some other horrifying troll dungeon of some kind, and force everybody to spam 2 hour troll pugs for valor.<br />

Well, to be fair, 10 man heroic mode tier 11 content was, for almost every single tier 11 boss (not Al-Akir), harder than 25. There was essentially zero dispute about that. <br />
<br />
I think you are correct however, regarding firelands. The consensus is that 25 man heroic mode firelands bosses are harder than 10 man heroics.</div></div><hr />

Arenas and rated battlegrounds will still earn Conquest faster, but with this change you can now work your way up by running normal BGs, if you so choose Wonderful. After 7 years they're starting to get it. Too bad everyone who gave a damn about these things have left or are leaving for other games.</div></div><hr />

The thing I dislike most about WoW is that it forces you to &quot;socialize&quot;. I definitely do NOT want commitments and obligations towards other players in a game.I want to play with other players and against other players, after all this is an mmorpg, but I do not want to have any obligations at any time! No commitment. The battleground and dungeon system in 4.2 is nice and ok, but for Arenas or Raids you have to have a team or raiding guild, and that package comes only with obligations... you basically lose your freedom.In 4.3 we get our freedom and the possibility to earn the (almost) best gear in game without beeing forced into long term cooperation with others. Independency. YES!!!I DO NOT WANT OBLIGATIONS IN A GAME.</div></div><hr />

Only thing I'd like to see is slightly better gear for the people that do RBG's and arena because they are much harder and require a ton more skill so should be rewarded for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you know ... you cannot buy set items with VP anymore<br />
<br />
25 raids still get 3 T-Tokens vs 1 in 10, so its still a bit more<br />
<br />
Aren't they changing that to 2 vs 1?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very low threshold you have there. Now we no longer have to play stupid tricks to get other people geared up, no longer have to carry someone until they are competitively geared. Oh that is right, PvPers are even worse than Raiders when it comes to their Barbie dolls. <br />
<br />
Frankly I think all BG queued players should be in the same exact gear, then it might be a challenge. Any PvP environment which rewards time over skill will always fail and that is what the current system is all about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We've made slight adjustments to the Valor Point (VP) drops on the 4.3 PTR which testers can now see. In both 10- and 25-player raids, bosses will now drop 100 VP each (down from 115 and 135 respectively). We’ll also be changing Firelands raid bosses to drop 50 VP per kill upon release of the patch.</div></div><hr />
