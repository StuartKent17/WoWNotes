It looks like we even have a saturday news post this week, hurray! Along with the legendary dagger screenshot released yesterday, it seems that the official korean website (http://kr.battle.net/wow/ko/blog/990241/%EC%96%B4%EB%91%A0%2C_%EC%9C%A0%EB%A0%B9%2C_%EB%82%A0%EA%B0%9C%2C_%EB%8B%A8%EA%B2%80_%EA%B 7%B8%EB%A6%AC%EA%B3%A0_%EB%8F%84%EC%A0%81-2011_09_23#blog) released 2 extra screenshots of new spectral flying mounts. <br />
<br />
There's no information on where players will be able to get them but it wouldn't be surprising to see them as rewards of the new Darkmoon Faire or any of the new features introduced with Patch 4.3. Thanks to annoyingmoose for his forum post about these mounts (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/983736-4.3-Spectral-Gryphon-and-Wyvern-mounts).<br />

Not unless they made it how the moonkin hatchling mini-pet is. Depending on your faction depends on which mount you will get when you purchase it. I do believe they would make it Darkmoon Faire since they are revamping it, and I guess make it more appealing to players to get exalted with them.</div></div><hr />

Why cant they come up with some NEW mounts =/ I mean all they did was to make the gryphon and wyvern have the spectral look... And even worse is that it's most likely faction based which one you can get, yeah really not impressed. It's kinda sad really that they dont make more of an effort.

I would gladly give up mechanostriders and elekks as exclusives as long as I could take the horses away. DEAL.<br />

That was the spectral gryphon for corpse runs. Up until Wrath of the Lick King you always had to walk back to your corpse/instance, in Wrath they introduced spectral gryphons (where needed), so you recover faster. Don't mix this two.<br />

I can. They did it for the wolf &amp; whatever the alliance one was, so it simply follows that they'd do the same for flying mounts. I really wish they would do something about the wyvern, though, since the model doesn't translate well with the spectral skin.</div></div><hr />

Cause everything in patch 4.3 is rehashed right? &gt;_&gt;<br />
Rehashed is such a dumb word anyway, you could say everything is &quot;Rehashed&quot; if they use the model before.<br />
<br />
So every sports game/ sequel is rehashed content?<br />
<br />
On that note every mount, model, whole game universe in SW:tor is &quot;rehashed&quot; from the old Star wars MMO/ movies.<br />

I second that, exactly what I thought when I first saw them. Makes a bit of sense: as a prize for amassing a giant load of mounts you get a spectral version of the most basic (flying) mount of your faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is so true, how can people say &quot;bliz is so lazy omg&quot; in reference to just two mounts? Not only is there appearance a matter of opinion, but it's two mounts you didn't have before. How can they say that when we are also having 3 new instances (with new models and such) a raid (with new mechanics upon other things) the changes to both lfd and lfr coming. Oh and void storage and gear change too. <br />

Nothing well ever be as ugly as the frostwyrm mounts if you ask me, and by saying so I've just rattled the cage, since most people thinks that they are amazing, which I'll never understand, mainly because they look nothing like frostwyrms. It's all subjective.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why she should stand out that much as to get a whole new model.<br />
Nice textures and everything like Thrall did but not completely new. That'd stretch it a little too much for a small dungeon boss.<br />
<br />
Considering she was the Queen of the elves and said to be the most beautiful, she needs *something* to not just be 'yet another night elf' in a dungeon that should have a few, at least before they (potentially) turn into satyrs.<br />
Her current (read: naga) form will definitely be interesting when they reveal it.</div></div><hr />
