[Patch 2.4] Not so many classes changes ?<br />
It seems that after all, the patch 2.4 won't change tons of things about class balancing, at least at the beginning, we'll probably see more classes modifications during the different updates of the test version.<br />
I'm going to be a bit cautious in what I say in this regard. Will there be some changes to classes? Yes, there will be some. We're not rushing into a bunch of class changes for this patch at this point. Consider the patch to be a bit more progressive in nature. As we go along, the developers are going to be keeping a close eye on the results of any changes and additions and then making changes as they feel they are necessary. How many changes occur are going to be based on testing over time. This is why it's important for players to get in and test it as much as possible.<br />
<br />
We want to make sure that the changes we are making are viable and practical for continued balance of the classes and don't want to put in too many changes at once and essentially skew the results too much one way or another.<br />

[Patch 2.4] Caverns of Time teleporter<br />
You won't need an awfully high reputation to get teleported in the Caverns of Time, it's just a way to make the life of a lot of players easier. <br />
It will be available for anyone with the appropriate reputation. We plan to make it as easily accessible to everyone as possible, but you will still need to get a sufficient amount of reputation (easily gained ) before being able to use it.<br />

[Patch 2.4] New cooking recipes<br />
As mentioned in the 2.4 compilation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=4062.0), cooking leveling will be made easier in 2.4, Bornakk posted one of the new recipe available in the patch.<br />
<br />
It seems that the Juicy Bear Burgers will give +14 Spell Damage/Healing and Charred Bear Kabobs will give +24 Attack Power<br />
It sounds like you need either some Charred Bear Kabobs or Juicy Bear Burgers! oh so yummy mmmm...<br />
<br />
Oh, right, details, they'll be purchasable from either Bale (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=2806) (Horde) or Malygen (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=2803) (Alliance) in Felwood in patch 2.4, they'll use meat added to level 48-56 bears, and they will require 250 skill to learn so you won't require fishing to get to 300 cooking.<br />

Stealth / Prowl<br />
I don't know how many times I have to state that this is not a bug. Stealth and Prowl (as opposed to Vanish and Feign Death) are not combat escape mechanisms. They will not remove you from an NPCs target list. This is an intentional design decision on the part of the developers of the game. No matter how much you may disagree, this means it is not a bug.

[Patch 2.4] Combat log changes<br />
I'm aware that some of you won't understand this post, but it's still fairly interesting it you take the time to read it entirely.<br />
With the release of patch 2.4.0, we’ve made some enormous changes to the existing combat log. While this will result in some hard work now, it should be easier to maintain your AddOns in the future.<br />
<br />
The feature we’re most proud of is the ability to filter your combat log. The combat log stores the last five minutes worth of raw combat events. Filters can be setup on multiple criteria, affiliation, ownership, etc. Any events that match the current filter are passed through the client via the COMBAT_LOG_EVENT message. The combat log filter is global. However, AddOns which want to parse all events the moment they happen can register for the COMBAT_LOG_EVENT_UNFILTERED message. This should allow all existing AddOns to still respond to combat events without a complicated middle-manager AddOn.<br />
While the default combat log will only be setting 1-2 filters at a time, the WoW client supports many simultaneous filters. It’s possible to setup multiple filters to filter very specific source-target-event combinations. If a combat log event passes any of the filters, the COMBAT_LOG_EVENT event fires. This allows AddOns to define extremely specific settings we chose not expose in the base UI.<br />
<br />
The new combat log will be coming with two text formats. One is the familiar, grammatically correct sentences with substitutions. The other is a terse format, containing the source, target, spell, action and result. There will be a number of ways to manipulate the formatting, from unit name coloring to coloring the damage numbers by their magic school. The settings used for these formats are stored in the Blizzard_CombatLog_Filters variable.<br />
<br />
The result of the new terse format is that it’s very easy to write AddOns to modify or extend the format which ships with 2.4.0. In the formatting section, you can read up on a quick demonstration of how to convert the combat log to a “Nurfed” style combat log. While you can do a lot by just adjusting the settings within WoW, it’s also possible to provide an AddOn that changes the strings used to generate the Combat Log messages. This allows for more extensive formatting changes without re-writing the entire parsing engine. See the Formatting Section for an example.<br />
<br />
The whole combat log also supports a new coloring model, based on context. While by default, entire lines are a single color, highlighting the most important details. The combat log also supports coloring just unit names, spells, actions and damage numbers. Spells and damage can also be colored by school. However, there are several features not exposed in the base UI that AddOns can use right away. These are event-specific coloring, unit coloring with greater granularity and the ability to customize the list of highlighted events.<br />
<br />
There are several other formatting related features. You can enable timestamps which show the time that spell or attack happened. You can show or hide square braces, change formatting without refreshing the combat log and disable the display of raid icons. These features were too niche to go into the base UI, but can be easily exposed for power users. By now you’ve already thought of some features of your own and are ready to get to coding. So let’s jump straight to some examples.</div></div><hr />

going to the official forums the blue post seems to be a response to links posted on either thott or wowhead. and it seemed the blue post was somewhat confirming what people had already suspected as seeing for new cooking recipes. i only skimmed it so that may not be totally accurate, but i guess the source you are looking for is thott/wowhead rumors confirmed by bornakk.</div></div><hr />

i thought the half mana cost, 30 second cd with only individual ticks being dispel'd was a great idea, don't see why they don't go to that. or even a similar lifebloom effect where it heals for a decent amount upon dispel. to me that isn't a hard fix and i imagine you will see some new mechanics in 2.4 ptr.</div></div><hr />

Considering the lowest level mob that drops Basilisk Meat is 61 having a +spell dmg recipe for the pre-portal bracket will be nice. Yes a level 55 character can eat the basilisk but new players may not have the resources to farm &amp; make the more potent food and the real reason behind the recipes are to smooth out the gaps in cooking for players that haven't leveled it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
that is correct. the main reason was that previously to level cooking from 250-300 it required fishing, essentially for the longest time in the game these went hand-in-hand. you fished and then cooked what you fished. <br />
<br />
now there are viable non-fishing dependent recipes to get 300 cooking. as nice as low level recipes are, these are designed to drop from mobs in the 48-56 range. so to wait until lvl 55 and use real lvl 70 food is not a far stretch.</div></div><hr />

A hot that had to be cleansed about 10 times would be slightly overpowered I think. If they do make any change to earth shield expect about a 30% chance to resist being dispelled. Besides, having to dispel each tick individually would just make the shaman go out of mana faster since they are usually the ones having to do the purge spam.<br />
<br />
If i had to change it I think something like &quot;Cannot be dispelled until target recieves a direct heal&quot; would be a more interesting change. Your earth shield is safe until you start throwing more heals onto the target. Seems like it would be a more interesting mechanism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
depends, purge and dispel both remove 2 debuffs, so technically 5 times total, excluding that 5 seconds in which is has actually proc'd 1-2 times at least. also there would be no healing done if i were dispel'd per tick, and with a 30 second cd you would still see people rush to get it off, or ignore it when its been on for 10-15 seconds or more. <br />
<br />
even at a 30% resist rate its going to take a lock or hunter 2-3 tries at most to remove it and even less on average. and now it becomes more of a game of balancing your mana vs. helping out your dps on the shaman. to me for such a crucial ability in terms of shaman arena healing a mere 30% is not sufficient, if it was a single dispel it should be &gt;50%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
pallys with their shield...shamans don't use shields in arenas? priests/druids have way more survival abilities its true, and thats why they are generally the choice of healer for 2v2 and 3v3. <br />
<br />
my 30 second cd idea also assumed a lowered mana cost and that earth shield is dispelled 1-2 ticks at a time or had a very high dispel resistance, maybe 60% normal 5-15% mass dispel.</div></div><hr />

oh rofl, i read that wrong. i though you meant literally a shield as in like the off hand equip slot...my fault. <br />
<br />
well pally shields are no exception, they can be removed by priests and are an oh sh!t defense at best, once the bubble is down you can just kill them easily again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is probably why the shaman's shield doesn't have a 5 minute cooldown and the paladin shield does.</div></div><hr />
