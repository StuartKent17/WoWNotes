The Guardian Cub Heading into the Blizzard Archive<br />
In approximately two weeks (no sooner than June 18), the titanically cute Guardian Cub (https://us.battle.net/shop/en/product/world-of-warcraft-pet-guardian-cub) will vanish from the Battle.net Shop and head into hiberation in the Blizzard Archive. If you’ve been thinking about adopting this in-game pet, now’s your chance before it's no longer available for purchase.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
If you tell people something is in limited supply and will be discontinued, you are artificially making it a 'rare' item. This will cause an influx of new sales. Once it is removed, they will then get an influx of 'complaints' that people couldn't buy it at the time and its not fair that some have it and some don't. So to appease the masses they will 'reluctantly' place it back in the Blizzard Store. But re-introduce it as some sort of item you can buy with the 'Recruit-a-Friend' tokens.</div></div><hr />

May I ask you where you live? Unless it is North Korea, I am sorry to be like &quot;OMFG..a company in the free capitalistic market trying to make more money, what the fuck is the world coming to?&quot; - And if you don't like it, may I make the novel suggestion to not buy it?

<br />
Blizzard can do only evil in the minds of some. It was an experiment into real life money pets, sellable by players ingame for gold. They are discontinuing it. They probably have their reasons.<br />
<br />
However there is certainly not going to be as much money made on this pet in the next two weeks, as there would be on it, if they kept it in the store for 3 more years.<br />
<br />
Are people going to rush to buy it in these two weeks? Certainly some will. <br />
Is it advertised that it's going to become unavailable, to get people purchasing it. Yes it is. <br />
Is it being taken down to get more profit from it that would be gained, keeping it in the store? I see no way that that could be true.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Baneleaf</div><div class="date">2014-06-04, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This pet was an experiment that proved that people would buy things for real money and sell them for gold. The problem was it is not nearly as effective as the people that buy game cards and the battle.net bucks and sell them for gold. The major issue with that market is the fear that they are using someones stolen credit card at Walmart.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because we all know they're just sitting on a fully ready-to-go beta client, and are withholding it out of spite for the playerbase. /sigh /sarcasm<br />
Probably taking it off the store because sales have slowed to a trickle, so get one final burst then keep it out of the store for a year or two. Not an uncommon sales practice at all.</div></div><hr />

Less content? In what way? Afaik it'll have everything an expansion usually does, + the Garrisons. No new races or class ain't exactly a must for an expansion, especially seeing as we've gotten 3 new races with the last 2 expansions. <br />
<br />
No one wants the &quot;ugly shit&quot; eh? How about you stop confusing your opinion with general fact? Not that prices will go up that much since people who wanted it probably got it already, but yeaaah...tons of people want it. One of my fav pets tbf part of my first 25 pet team. ^^<br />

Wouldn't be that hard I believe to keep the already in-game pets sellable and prevent the ones from the store bought after a certain deadline from being tradeable.<br />
<br />
<br />
But it seems to be working as a boost to sales, already seeing people advertising it in trade as a &quot;Soon to be unobtainable!&quot; pet.</div></div><hr />

It certainly did prompt cash sales which simply would not have happened with a traditional store purchase.<br />
Therefore them retiring it is not some money grab, but just the opposite.<br />
<br />
Sure, retiring it can have the effect of a burst of sales, but long-term I think it could have done more if kept on or even expanded.<br />
More of a range would have watered down the excessive supply of just one, and imo would have been far better for driving sales.</div></div><hr />

This was an experiment that fortunately for all of us failed. They decided they don't need the money they could get from items that you can sell in game. Unfortunately, the loss is a little pet from the store. What we have gained by the removal of this item far outweighs the small loss. Besides that, they have given fair warning, so no one who really wants that pet should not have it at this point. Why are you so bummed about this? I don't get it?<br />

That really does not make a difference IMO, something no longer obtainable increases in value, regardless.

Even though allowing the purchase of gold though real money (directly, or indirectly) could be considered unhealthy to the game's fair playing field, having gold farmers out there providing a similar service is worse.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has moved the focus on accumulating gold, and instead on getting gear though skillful play and dedication, to the point where gold farmers don't find it as profitable to do what they do. This is being discontinued for the same reason that D3's real money AH was removed, the tradeoff isn't worth it anymore.<br />

I'm inclined to agree with you except for 2 factors, this pet is not rare at all atm, and hardly anyone ever really wanted it to start with.

Did they release a graph or something showing the sales of this pet?

That being they're pulling it because they no longer want the side effects of RMT (particularly when the RM portion is from stolen CCs).

I think the reason for that was to save the brand. The RMAH affected everything about the game, from how gear and loot drops were designed to how people played, and it was horrible.<br />

But I admit I feel there was goodwill there too. I'm happy they did it and it was the main reason I bought and enjoyed RoS.<br />

Seems like this particular experiment has ended, and they're moving on to things like 90 boost that are helpers to getting to end-game, an actual perceived value.

<br />
Ummm...no...Announcing that something will be removed from the store is usually a test to see how much sales increase, if it's by a lot, they'll do it again with other digital items. Notice, they didn't say it'd be gone forever, they said it'd head into &quot;hibernation&quot; in the Blizzard archives, which means it'll probably come back at a later date. But really, this is just a test to see how any sales they get, and I believe this is the first time they've tried this. That's how it works, I've seen it done countless times before.<br />
<br />
This is eventually the start of limited time availability items, this item will go away for a little while, then an announcement will be made that it is either coming back, or it's coming back for a limited time, and they'll see how much sales they get from doing that as well.<br />

It's a business, treat it as such.</div></div><hr />

Remember this is the first time they've retired something on the store, and it is the only item that can be sold ingame, that is a huge part of this story. Also, if they wanted to increase demand for any item in the game they could do it at any time for any reason, for example, they could make lil'rag the most valuable pet in the game, then charge 20 dollars more for it than any other pet, and then say you can only buy it on the second tuesday of every other month, and that would make lil'rag far more valuable, and increase their pocket books.</div></div><hr />

Well, it goes by the same logic as Blizz first selling the item and then ceasing to sell the digital item without of any obvious reason. You got to ask why...and if you come up with no other reason than &quot;cause they want to make as much money as possible&quot;...then it's quite fine if the other site is blaming both of Blizzards decisions for being &quot;just to grab money&quot;. <br />

Angry at Blizzard for not even hinting that it may go away at some point and then just axing it completely. To have something in a normal supply which then runs to zero for no reason is what I am angry about.</div></div><hr />

The thing is that some people will buy the cubs now for real money in hope to sell them for big money/gold during the next years. Blizz is calculating with that too. The truth is tho: Due to the massive duping going on all over the pet market right now(soultrader, kites, bananas, rocket chicken and some more all dropped by 80-90% within a couple of weeks), there is no way to calculate and hence it's just a huge and very risky gamble to buy the cub now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My post was about business strategy in general, and that Blizzard is now testing this out, I thought this was quite evident and obvious, but, apparently not. Businesses have to change what they're doing and come up with new ways to make money, they're testing the waters by doing this. Just as they test many other things, whether it's selling virtual pets, mounts, cosmetic items, putting up real money auction houses, in-game XP boosts for money, whatever the case, the first one is always a test to see how it's received.<br />
<br />
Though your example is quite flawed to start with...How do they make lil'rag the most valuable pet in the game in the first place? Forget the part where they THEN charge 20 dollars more for it, and make it so it's only sold on certain days. If that did those things when it was released, sure, maybe it would be.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, the pet will be back in due time, and it'll be for sale as a &quot;this week only&quot; limited time item. It's just a test, it's as simple as that, nothing more, nothing less.</div></div><hr />

Just as they test many other things, whether it's selling virtual pets, mounts, cosmetic items, putting up real money auction houses, in-game XP boosts for money, whatever the case, the first one is always a test to see how it's received.Basically the way I see this is you're assuming they are doing it as a test to see how much money they can make from removing something from the game, as in, to find out what happens to the ingame value. But for all you know they're going to put this on the BMAH or in loot-bags or something, so it is a huge assumption, based on your perception that everything they do is to make money. I'm pointing out that not everything they do is just to make money. I think that is also 'obvious', unless you just don't want to see it.<br />
<br />
<br />

Forget the part where they THEN charge 20 dollars more for it, and make it so it's only sold on certain days. If that did those things when it was released, sure, maybe it would be.The way to do this is by making it completely OP, (obviously it's already slightly OP that's why I used it as an examplet here), so that a pet battler feels he must have it to compete. Then once they do that, they could raise the price. If they did everything just for greed, and not thinking about gameplay, they would do stuff like that.<br />
<br />
Another example is they could make it so the guardian cub gives +2% to exp rate, so that would increase sales of the pet. Removing it from sale is a pretty weak way to make it sell more, if you keep in mind all the ways they have to create perceived value for an item.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like I said before, the pet will be back in due time, and it'll be for sale as a &quot;this week only&quot; limited time item. It's just a test, it's as simple as that, nothing more, nothing less.Yes, ok. Like all TCG card pets are just limited time retirements also? This is not really a fun conversation.

The normal supply you are probably on about is the AH, in which neither of us were quick enough to read the news about prior to others engorging the supply to reap the price later. I'll probably find myself heading to the Blizz store to pick up one for myself...</div></div><hr />

They decided they don't need the money they could get from items that you can sell in game. Unfortunately, the loss is a little pet from the store. What we have gained by the removal of this item far outweighs the small loss. Besides that, they have given fair warning, so no one who really wants that pet should not have it at this point. Why are you so bummed about this? I don't get it?<br />
<br />
Because it is digital. There is no reason whatsoever to remove it like this, other than to artificially drive sales. No company or sane person would decide that they do not need the money, we all need them. But doing such moves is pretty, well, pathetic. But whatever, this is just a personal opinion of mine. It's not like they are not known for removing stuff from WoW (quests, skills, drop items, flying lol).</div></div><hr />

The reason the Guardian Cub is being removed is because it's caused nothing but trouble for Blizzard since they implemented it. How many times have you seen people complain that their Cub has gone missing, only to find it was originally bought with a stolen CC or a CC that used a chargeback.<br />
<br />

<br />
You are plain wrong. A number of other store pets can be bought and gifted with stolen credit cards and chargebacks. The only thing that was different is that you can trade the cub via AH which then made it impossible tor Blizz to delete it(cause the buyer from the AH could be innocent. Whatever you buy from AH is your's...counts for all the duped pets on the AH right now too.). So it's definitely not about people complaining....cause that won't change due to the other pets that still make fraud possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is part of the reason why people complain, they have absolutely NO CLUE about how much work it takes to create anything in the game. This pet alone probably took a minimum of 120 man hours, and probably a lot more than that. The pet had a different model (no it doesn't share a model with the mount, you can see it is different), different skin, and unique animations. It also had to be put into the database, verified, tested, someone had to come up with its pet battle stats, which had to be checked for balance. There was probably a minimum of 5 people involved in creating this pet, and again, likely more than that.<br />
<br />
If it was purely a copy and reskin of something that had already existed, it MIGHT have only taken 8-16 hours to produce.</div></div><hr />
