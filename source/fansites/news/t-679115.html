<br />
Q. What is the Mohawk Grenade?<br />
A. The Mohawk Grenade is Mr. T's latest invention: an in-game item that, when hurled at another character, gives everyone within the blast radius an instant T-riffic haircut. Don't worry, you and your friends will look gooooood.<br />
<br />
Q. Where do I get it?<br />
A. Quit your jibber-jabber and claim your Mohawk Grenades from any of the Night Elf Mohawk NPCs camped outside every starting zone.<br />
<br />
Q. What regions are eligible to claim the Mohawk Grenade?<br />
A. North America, Europe and Korea.<br />
<br />
Q. Is this a permanent item?<br />
A. Each Mohawk Grenade has five charges before exhausting its power, and you're welcome to claim another once the charges are gone.<br />
<br />
Q. How long will the Mohawk Grenade be available in-game?<br />
A. Claim Mohawk Grenades starting November 16th in North America and November 24th in Europe and Korea. They'll be available until... well, until the Night Elf Mohawk decides his work is done.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why they want to add something like this. I mean.... really... they added the mohawk haircut for some races, but this is just stupid... whats the point? I would rather them work on an actual cool/useful item than this pointless thing. doesnt make sense...</div></div><hr />

Not so much<br />
<br />
<br />
This is... debatable. The idea of a toy train that makes everyone nearby do the /train sound sounds good on paper, but gets REALLY annoying REALLY quick. A crazy train would be the same annoyance as the party grenades when you get stuck with a joker who thinks it's hilarious to toss it down on the fish feast. But at least you can click off the buff from the party grenade. =P<br />
<br />
As for the Night Elf Mohawk grenade, I couldn't care either way. It should be good for a few chuckles, at least.</div></div><hr />

Oh for the love of...<br />
<br />
Seriously. Go kill yourself right now. I am not even joking. Go upstairs out of your parents basement, borrow your parents handgun, load a bullet in, put it down your throat and pull the trigger. Not even joking, please I am begging you to do it. <br />
<br />
First of all, it must of REALLY taken a long time to do this. I mean they must of had their entire development team have to do this, right? It didnt push back IC cit, that will still come out when Blizzard damn well wants it to. Why do you care? You won't be doing IC raids for a while, at least not until everyone else does and you shitty guild is able to get in there. <br />
<br />
The great thing is, once 3.3 patch hits...it will be filled with people QQing about how it was rushed and they should of waited. WoW forum faggots aren't happy unless they have something to bitch about. Its just sad when they bitch about something like this. How long before we see people &quot;claiming&quot; they are canceling their account over this. <br />

<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm torn on this thing. But I can see how people would (and I probably will, somewhat) bitch about this.<br />
<br />
On the onehand it's a pretty lol item to throw in with some random other fun crap you can toss at people during AFKs or while you're bored in Dalaran...<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other....<br />
<br />
OF COURSE the first thing I want to see when I start RPing is a bunch of immature morons tossing these at my fellow RPers and giving them all Night Elf faces with mohawks. For F's sakes, why don't you just give Griefers a [Rain of lulz] spell, huh, Blizzard?<br />
<br />
On most days, I can really see Blizz's side in the few &quot;QQ RPers neglected!&quot; debates that pop up every once in a while, but for this, I'ma have to stick on the whiny side.<br />
<br />
Looks like I'll be doing channel RP until the idiocy boils down to Silvermoon again and people get bored with chucking 'tard grenades around.</div></div><hr />

This. Except the relieved part. The Nigh Elf Mohawk thing was funny when it came out, and still kind of is, but this is going to get really old, really fast and it overall ruins the joke.<br />

Q. How long will the Mohawk Grenade be available in-game?<br />
A. Claim Mohawk Grenades starting November 16th in North America and November 24th in Europe and Korea. They'll be available until... well, until the Night Elf Mohawk decides his work is done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a commercial pure and simple doesn’t add anything to the game just cheapens it trying desperately to appeal to a younger and younger base as they drive their old school players away.<br />
<br />
Blizz has the obligation to their stockholders to make a profit, there is no denying that responsibility but doing so in irresponsible ways, eroding at the base of their game for the hope of attracting a few more kids (who have the least staying / purchasing power) is financially stupid. MMOs require 2 elements to make them successful 1) a responsive and innovative support staff to keep up maintenance, solve cresses, and develop new and interesting content and 2) a active and interested player community who nurtures and enriches the product. There are plenty of fun and well designed MMOs out there with just as much if not more of #1 we the players are the ones that make #2 good and it's about time Blizz appreciates that fact before they go around insulting us with stupid marketing schemes.<br />
<br />
PS btw I fully expect a ton of ppl to go “get a grip man its just a game don’t take it so seriously” well for 15 bucks a month and 30+ hrs a week it is serious. I play for the “experience” of the game, the mystical pseudo realism, the lore something that has been on a rather prolific decline of late. If this is the direction Blizz is intending their product to go (and not a victim of poor plot design / lazy developing) then I have to accept that but hopefully Blizz realizes that there are quite a few dedicated players like myself still out there and by acting in this manor and disrespecting their own product they risk loosing us. If they think that rout makes them the most money so be it but I honestly miss the days where Blizz (at least seemed) to care more about the quality of their product than their bottom line.<br />

Maybe it was all just wishful thinking, a company dedicated to quality over quick bucks, a madman’s dream.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">somegit</div><div class="date">2009-11-16, 10:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally love this idea. When I first saw it in Dalaran, I wasn't awear of it happening. And I was like &quot;... wtf!?&quot; and had a good laugh. THen I saw more people haveing it and I was like &quot; ok now this is getting strange, where are all these mohawks coming from?&quot; Then I was mohawked in a ride by grenading, and was, in turned, pittied and fooled. I personally love it when Blizzard inserts these cute fun little things. I mean, sure things like lil K.T. the Pugging Pug, Or heck any of the events, are progressing us through Ice Crown Citadel, but so WHAT!? I'm from an RP realm, so I enjoy fun little additions. I mean its not like &quot;OMG we need to add Mohawks but now we gotta move ICC a month back!&quot;<br />
<br />
Do you really think Blizzard is going to drop everything, to make one silly addition? I'm sure they have tons of development teams, ones testing patches, one now beta testing and developing Cataclysm, and people who design things like this, weapons, and other things that are either useful in game, or just fun to have (TGC anyone?). To bitch about it, just is sad. Doomsayers that predict the end of WoW because 40 man raids are no more and Blizzard isn't releasing Patches sooner because they are too concentrated on making silly things. Get over yourselves and just have some fun!</div></div><hr />

if I may interject with the phrase you used. &quot; I play for the “experience” of the game&quot;. Key word &quot;I play&quot; meaning. Your way of playing. Just because its your way of playing, doesn't mean that every single 11 million person subscribed and playing, plays the same way too. and with 11 million players, activly playing, I think the stock holders are very happy with Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Oh great, I can see it now. The blizzard store will then release along side little K.T. &quot; Lil Mr. T&quot;. A night Elf Mohawk that will follow you around, and randomly shout at people &quot; Suddup fo'&quot; and lob grenades at them to turn everyone in a 10 yard radius into a Night Elf Mohawk.</div></div><hr />

If you look at some of the stuff that came out in that recent interview (the &quot;arenas were a bad idea&quot; one), you'll see that WoW actually has a decent turnover rate, such that they do need to do some recruiting and marketing to keep those numbers up. There's something like twice as many ex-WoW players are there are WoW players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Highlighting the point of my post. I play the game in an adult serious fashion. This is a stupid juvenile marketing ploy which is both annoying and insulting to the more mature (insert stuck up) players.<br />
<br />
Blizz is in the business of pleasing it's customers. Their customers fall into many categories (Casual / Hardcore, RPers, Pet collectors, Altaholics, PvPers) discounting any one of these groups (even if some of them are diametrically opposed) is financially dangerous since they risk loosing members of that group. That is why Blizz has gone through such lengths to appease PvE &quot;Hardcores&quot; with Hard Modes while embracing the new &quot;Casual Raider&quot;.<br />
<br />
This stunt, in my opinion, is a direct assault on veteran players who enjoy this game on a deeper level. It's a silly superficial addition that detracts rather than adds to the games community and culture. Yes it's a game but would Halo players enjoy if Bunji changed out Master Sergeant armor for pink leotards / hoop skirts? That may attract female players to an otherwise male dominated genre but you would be a fool to put it in. Why does this change not matter in the same way?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Disconting groups? If they stoped doing fun things like this, it would be discounting me? how about that? And just because you were there from the beginning, doesn't give you an automatic obligation, that the people of Blizzard should only cater to people like you. Financially dangerous? Are you going to stop playing the game because of Mr.T? Are half of the world of warcraft players going to stop playing because Blizzard is having fun? I don't know for sure, but not likely. <br />
<br />
They are doing their job, they are working on Ice Crown Citadel, Cataclysm, and what have you. To get so angry, so QQed about a little funny event that may only peek interest for about half a week, week tops, seems silly in its own way. And not the same kind of fun silly Blizzard is doing. Sort of a mixture between sad and pathetic silly. If they &quot;directly assaulted veteran players&quot; as you claim, you better go file a lawsuit right away! THEY SHOULD BE SUED FOR HAVING FUN!</div></div><hr />

can you switch do decaf and wait a few weeks? This isn't going to slow down development. Bugs and other problematic scripts will slow down the release of a patch. Thats why they have a PTR. Take a chill pill, all of ya.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but we're also the country who's leaders previously said that we're &quot;unhyphenated.&quot; You're either Canadian or you're not. There's not supposed to be any distinction.<br />
<br />
Also, the people responsible for this? They probably have nothing to do with 3.3 in the first place or were asked to volunteer time to do it. Since it'd take approximately... what, half an hour to solo write the code you need since all the models already existed for it?</div></div><hr />

Americans like that are called rednecks and are as such because they have no culture besides the cowboy bullshit that was fed to them by cigarette companies. Those are the Americans that probably led to your hostility towards Americans in the first place. So no, you don't want Americans to forget their ancestory because that leads to ignorant douches who think America is perfect and can do no wrong.

<br />
I second that.<br />
<br />
How can you complain about something that doesn't impact gameplay, AT ALL!?<br />
<br />
The zombie event had it's perks: talking to the alliance as a horde when you're both a zombie, raiding your own faction's cities for the fun of it, ect.<br />
This however is as fun as throwing pumpkins; bunny ears; trains; ect. Clicking away buffs from stuff people throw at you gets old fast.<br />
Conclusion, some people find it annoying. Implementing useless &quot;fun&quot; items like this should only affect one's self not the rest of your server who you wanna bug with it.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, the zombie event did the same things to, by making essential NPCs such as Auctioneers and Flight Masters as zombies to deny usage of them just because someone thought it was &quot;fun&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, clearly this will delay the launch of Icecrown Citadel and 3.3. In Bizzaro WoW, the team not working on the content you're whining about being delayed by a ridiculously simple world event, is ruining your game. Right?</div></div><hr />

So you want the team that made night elf Mohawks to fix the pvp balance in the same amount of time they made the Mohawks? <br />

<br />
Knew someone would say that, and your right in the regard that your actions as a zombie affected other players aswell. Yet the same would be the case when an Alliance raid invades a Horde city or vica versa, except you had some NPCs at all major cities that would 2-3 shot zombies at some key points. All I'm saying is the zombie event had it's ups and downs. This however doesn't in my opinion, and a lot of people share that opinion, tho a lot disaggree aswell wich is fine. And I won't go as far as to say it shouldn't be or have been implemented, but it could've been implemented diffrently so it doesn't affect the other players. It's great for the people who think it's fun and let them mess around with it amongst eachother as much as they want, it would however be nice if they couldn't bother the rest of the people with it.<br />
They could've made it a selfbuff or atleast give it a debuff so when you remove it it can't be reapplied for the next 1hour or more, tho I wouldn't get my hopes up. Let's just hope it's like seasonal events and disappears after a week or two. :)</div></div><hr />

I remember way back when this game was taken seriously when the RPG element meant something and the game wasn't some silly pet collecting World of Pokémon wanabe. I got nothing against world events. In fact I think that the holidays are a lot of fun, AQ gate opening was a great idea, and the Zombie Invasion was a blast. But this fake event is a sham.<br />
<br />
---SNIP---<br />
<br />
<br />
You obviously never played the previous warcraft games. Blizzard is a fan of in game jokes and things, I'd hardly consider them being overly serious about their &quot;rpg&quot; element. And honestly, have you really seen the job blizzard did with including us with lore in wrath? I mean the amount of lore and player action in wrath overshadows the previous two end-games (phasing tech anyone?).<br />
<br />
And the reason why they have this &quot;collection&quot; like gameplay is because there needs to be something that players can achieve besides gear. Gear gets replaced constantly, but those other little perks are something to work for.<br />
<br />
Honestly it looks like just another &quot;back in vanilla days&quot; nostalgic post. The &quot;rpg&quot; element has only gotten better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder how many of the people that are bashing the naysayers are the same ones that are the first to jump up and scream at Blizz when something is delayed by even the slightest amount of time.<br />
<br />
I recall multiple things that Blizz has made excuses about in regards to how long it took to develop. Things small and simple like this. But when something (questionably) fun like this shows up, if someone speaks against it, then they &quot;should kill themselves&quot;, &quot;don't know how to have fun&quot; or is just a lame person.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that something like this would delay a patch, but there are many things that the development time could be better spent on. I'm sure I'll be brushed off as just another naysayer, but it doesn't change that Blizzard has made the excuse of &quot;it would take too much&quot; when asked if they could put in smaller things into the game.</div></div><hr />

First of all, it must of REALLY taken a long time to do this. I mean they must of had their entire development team have to do this, right? It didnt push back IC cit, that will still come out when Blizzard damn well wants it to. Why do you care? You won't be doing IC raids for a while, at least not until everyone else does and you shitty guild is able to get in there. <br />

LMFAO that shit is hilarious.<br />

For everyone who doesn't like these sorts of things, get over it. It's obviously not going to be around long and stop being so upset that people are enjoying a bit of trivial tomfoolery. Everyone's allowed to just be stupid sometimes. Try it. It's fun.<br />
<br />
On another note, yes I would be under the classification of African American in this country of the U.S. I, however, have no knowledge of Africa, nor have I ever been there. I don't know anyone from there either. I think it's hilarious that I am considered that just because of the color of my skin. I mean Charlize Theron is a true blue native African (from South Africa). Why don't we classify her as African American? Why? Because she's white that's why. See the hypocrisy in the whole labeling thing? Either do it right, and do it for everyone, or don't do it at all. I don't find &quot;offense&quot; to the term, but I do believe such labels amongst Americans themselves only create division. If someone wants to know their heritage, then that is fine. That's the job of the parents to teach that to their children. But I don't live there.

We know nothing of African culture, we do not speak the language or practice their ways.

<br />
That one guy is right. Most other countries don't divide us into categories like we do. We are just simply all Americans to them. Come to think of it, why do we hold the trump on being called &quot;Americans&quot; anyway? Why aren't we called United Statians or something like that? We are just one country on the whole of the Americas. Technically, Canadians, Brazilians, Mexicans etc. are just as much Americans as we are. Argh, I hate historical/geographical lessons/arguments...

This however is as fun as throwing pumpkins; bunny ears; trains; ect. Clicking away buffs from stuff people throw at you gets old fast.<br />
Conclusion, some people find it annoying. Implementing useless &quot;fun&quot; items like this should only affect one's self not the rest of your server who you wanna bug with it.<br />
<br />
<br />
So...people griefing lowbies for hours on end as zombies and essentially making the game unplayable for them by constantly killing auctioneers/flight masters/quest givers was OK, but you occasionally having to take a half second out of your play time to click off your Mr. T elf head is crossing a line?<br />

LMFAO that shit is hilarious.<br />
<br />
For everyone who doesn't like these sorts of things, get over it. It's obviously not going to be around long and stop being so upset that people are enjoying a bit of trivial tomfoolery. Everyone's allowed to just be stupid sometimes. Try it. It's fun.<br />
<br />
On another note, yes I would be under the classification of African American in this country of the U.S. I, however, have no knowledge of Africa, nor have I ever been there. I don't know anyone from there either. I think it's hilarious that I am considered that just because of the color of my skin. I mean Charlize Theron is a true blue native African (from South Africa). Why don't we classify her as African American? Why? Because she's white that's why. See the hypocrisy in the whole labeling thing? Either do it right, and do it for everyone, or don't do it at all. I don't find &quot;offense&quot; to the term, but I do believe such labels amongst Americans themselves only create division. If someone wants to know their heritage, then that is fine. That's the job of the parents to teach that to their children. But I don't live there. Neither did my parents, or their parents, or their parents etc. African Americans (real African Americans that moved here from Africa) actually take offense that this country calls us by that term. We know nothing of African culture, we do not speak the language or practice their ways.

This seems to ignore the fact that the term 'America' has long referred to the entire landmass of North and South America. For example, this map from 1507 refers to the entire landmass as 'America': http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Waldseemuller_map_2.jpg. This history is implicitly acknowledged in the naming of the country, given, as you pointed out, that it's the United States of America; for 'of America' to do any work in the sentence, 'America' must signify something else (e.g., the landmass), or else the sentence becomes meaningless. <br />
<br />
To imagine an analogous case, if the European Union had been named in a manner similar to the United States of America, it might have been the 'Union of Europe.' However, it would be nonsensical to say that citizens of non-union European states were not Europeans. They would Europeans by virtue of their placement on a landmass, rather than via membership of a political unit. It is the same with America, except most people simply don't think about it this way.<br />
<br />
This is not to say that the term 'American' is unambiguous, as people do use it to refer both to a the Americas (North and South) and also citizens of the United States of America. It just can't be the case that the phrase refers unequivocally only to citizens of the United States of America, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was only very early maps that referred to the whole continent as merely America, once more exploring was done it was generally divided into North and South America. Also, the US is the only country I can think of that is in a situation such as this. We are a single country on a continent with a similar name. The EU is still vastly different, since that is a group of actual nations, but each nation is still its own country. Comparatively, you would have to address each person on their location in the US to get on the same page (a person from California is in fact called a Californian, but outside of America they are generally just called Americans as the state level is usually not important to them), acting as if each state was its own country within a larger nation.<br />
<br />
The only other solution to the issue would be to call us United States of Americans, but that is pretty ridiculous when compared to the current standard of simply Americans.</div></div><hr />

However, to answer peoples argumentation about that Blizzard got different teams for different stuff..

The problem is, they are not just expressing a negative opinion, but acting as if it's gonna ruin every single aspect of the game, which is taking it a bit too far. Just saying &quot;I think Blizz is making a mistake&quot; would have been okay, but so far we've gotten theories on how this is gonna push back 3.3, how this ruins the gameplay experience and just general tinfoilhatting.<br />
<br />
And while it may attract people to play it (though I'm not sure whether they'll keep paying the subscription just because their idol or whatever is in the commercial), this may not be a bad thing. Sure, there may be idiots who don't know a thing about mummorpergers, but there may also be some uncut diamonds. Also, a company making money is really terrible and against the laws of logic.<br />
<br />
Also, as you said, it is a miniscule addition, not groundbreaking, it will not change a thing about how you level/raid/PvP (okay, there will be some dickheads ruining RP servers, that's for sure, but the good RP usually doesn't happen in Goldshire anyhow).</div></div><hr />

The only places people are gonna grief RPers with these are gonna be the highly populated ones, like Goldshire. And if you're RPing there, you may want to rethink what you consider to be roleplaying.<br />

Seriously, lighten up you guys. It's not this was something that they OMG SPENT A LONG TIEM on, it's not taking away from your release of 3.3, or affecting gameplay (For those of you complaining about RP realms...I play on one and have yet to be griefed by this. The only place you're likely to get griefed is in high pop places like Goldshire or around the banks in Dalaran maybe, and we know about what it's like to to try and RP in those places anyway so...).

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MyLifeIsRandom_</div><div class="date">2009-11-18, 03:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally made an account to get in on this. First off, it seems to me like every veteran, serious player, or what have you thinks this game is theirs. Despite the fact that not one of these people support Blizzard outside of their $15 a month, it's ironic that they complain at all. Blizzard made World of Warcraft. It's their own world that truly belongs only to them. It's like going to someone else's house and then insulting the owner and his/her family with a wall of text for not having a PS3, because you like PS3 at your house. Get off your fucking high horse already. Let me lay down a couple of points for you.<br />
<br />
1. If you put any more effort into this game than you do with anything in reality, unless you're into MLG for cash prizes, you are a moron. No game should be taken seriously for any reason. If you want to overreact to something trivial, go be a soccer fan in Brazil so you can mob the people who make you whine and cry at night. Otherwise, be silent now and forever.<br />
<br />
2. This event in no way impedes your gameplay beyond anything else in this game. God almighty forbid you have to take a short second to right click a buff, or just fucking roll with the joke. As for it ruining the RP experience, every RP whiner please just log off for good. This game was never meant to focus on RP. It's a game about doing quests, like pretty much every other game there is. I RP too, but I would never QQ about one item ruining my experience because a server is not made just for me and my RP buddies.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this information will, by some miracle, sink into you whining assholes and you will come to realize your points are quite invalid and only exist to whine about something that's not yours. Expect me to troll the whole of this forum when I have the time, disproving moronic statements everywhere as I have before.</div></div><hr />
