He and his team takes requests for any weapon from pop culture there in the youtube comments below his videos for those interested! Now I wish he would make the Warglaives of Azzinoth or Ashbringer!<br />
<br />
Also, I can't wait to see what kind of negative comments the Wow community will come up with about this video. *sits in front row seat and grabs some popcorn w/ a large soda*<br />

How pointless. Just like that chopper garbage. :rolleyes:<br />

Oh, we got one!<br />
<br />
Is this sarcasm? If not, then how is it like the chopper? Tony has his own youtube series where he makes weapons from pop culture (videogames, media, etc) every few weeks or so. This wasn't a highly advertised week long thing where he makes gorehowl, and there certainly wasn't any contest for it. It was just a nice community video posted by Blizzard out of the blue.</div></div><hr />

They literally just paid him to make a weapon, no development hours were spent on this short video. The money spent on the video I'm 100% sure didn't cut into development funds. <br />
<br />
But hey, it's better then Azeroth Choppers :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I don't think you understand the point. It's not the cost but the fact that they are promoting themselves when there is a sweeping negative feeling of the current state of game. It's not about sub dollars being spent, it's about a company GETTING ITS SHIT TOGETHER. The April Fool's thing is a tradition. This is just needless promo.

small?! its MASSIVE for a weapon of its type.<br />
<br />
the thing about weapons is you have to actually be able to wield them. The thing about weapons in RTS games, is that they have to be visible from a high up camera</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's the same as the cinematic/Wc3 version (remember it will look smaller on an orc), but the ingame one is bigger for character model reasons, since its a two hand. But it really does look almost identical, Man-at-Arms is badass. <br />

Blizzard is a multi-billion dollar company. <br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that after they saw the amazing job he did on Frostmourne last year for Man At Arms that they asked him to make a few Warcraft weapons. <br />
<br />
Pretty sure they've also paid him to do the Doomhammer and if we're really lucky we might get to see how he'd handle Ashbringer. <br />
<br />
Either way the sky ain't falling Chicken Little and any negative feelings about the current state of the game just have to do with the game, NOT with Blizzard paying for commercials. Or do you really think William Shatner claiming to be a shaman improved the game a bunch?</div></div><hr />

<br />
For those who are unable to understand the difference between game development and this sort of activity, I guess I should feel sorry for your small-mindedness, but...nah. It's your loss. I'll complain about game development issues in a way that makes sense, and continue to enjoy efforts like these that add to the quality of the game in other ways.<br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing more short videos like this one.</div></div><hr />

Oh I agree, and being someone who actually works in the software industry, i understand that marketing budget + resources do not = development budget + resources.<br />

<br />
Comically solid grasp on how budgets work! As with most businesses, Blizzard/Activision doesn't have a literal pool of &quot;development money&quot; that they are &quot;stealing&quot; from for in order to produce promotional videos/commercials/web advertisements, etc. This isn't zero sum, where if you spend X amount of dollars on promotion or developing another game you're reducing the available money for WoW content. Business doesn't work that way. The development budget is going to the same regardless of how many LARP weapons they pay to have made. First, Choppers is indeed lame. Second, Hearthstone makes money, a lot of it. That game isn't some freebie that only exists to because every month they are borrowing from the WoW development budget to keep it afloat. It wouldn't be continually advertised if HS wasn't bringing in the dough. The movie...lol Blizzard isn't exclusively paying for that movie out of, again, the magic well of WoW development dollars. It's being financed by Legendary, Blizzard and Atlas Entertainment, then on top of that Universal is paying for distribution. <br />
<br />
Lastly, I'd be willing to bet WoW's development budget is astronomically higher than any other game dev budget at Blizzard. How they decide to roll out content, while frustrating, has nothing to do with money being spent elsewhere. It's go everything to do with shrewd business planning. Give us too much and they are leaving money on the table, too little and they alienate their base. It's pretty obvious they aren't overly concerned with alienating the base.</div></div><hr />

Advertisements aren't a substitute for game content and making excuses to that effect makes you look like a sycophant.<br />
<br />
Marketing Teams/Advertisement designers do not make game content. So them making this, or working with people to make this, has nothing to do with content.<br />
<br />
You can't just assign a marketer to development and have them make content, you saying that you can do that makes you look like a complete and utter moron.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it was already explained in this thread, but for anyone that isn't trolling, it isn't about the money allocated to this or the dev time that it doesn't take away from, its the fact that in a content drought where there is already a lot of discontent over the current state of the game, the stuff making headlines is this, april fools jokes, and features from other games.

Yes, we get that the fucking axe didn't mean Holinka didn't get his wages this month. What this is just another symptom of however is that due to Blizzard's overall inclination to make up for deficits in the game quality with creating hype and sources for microtransactions, there seems to be more money &quot;wasted&quot; on fluff, that could have been used to hire an extra artists or four to design a dungeon/quest hub/race/whathaveyou, or god forbid someone expensive and extremely talented to take another look at the new models, just because there's not as much quick profit in that as in promotion.<br />
<br />
Then again, if they really can't convert money into content no matter how much disposable resources they're sitting on, then perhaps it's high time for them to charge their customers less.</div></div><hr />

Yeah sure, the WoW money stays with WoW, and the side projects are paid from the... from the... they are paid from the... FROM THE DONATIONS... that... the players donate towards sideprojects... or something. Right? Or they found a technique to summon money from thin air maybe?<br />

It's not only small, it also appears very light (due to the construction) and, while I understand why they scaled/weighted it down, it feels like it doesn't do a true Orc's weapon justice. Surely they could have afforded to have a legit Strongman there to wield a more accurate version rather than the &quot;themed&quot; Grommash ;)<br />
<br />
Also, Bladefist/Bulwark sound like excellent suggestions for future replicas. They may not be that important to the lore, but they are both very recognizable.</div></div><hr />

They could focus on keeping the players they already have subscribed by offering new content more regularly. It doesn't always have to be new raid tiers, but other MMO's offer smaller content patches each month that move the story forward. They even have the platform to do it with the garrison campaigns but those were one and done and we're waiting 4-6 months for the next set of them.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is literally shitting out money and they're expanding their game library from originally Diablo, WoW and SC to nearly 6 game series now. My point is that I very much doubt that this project ended up delaying and halting content production. It's pretty evident that with all the expansion going on by developing more games that WoW is short-staffed for current content production rather than purely financial.</div></div><hr />

^This, hit the nail on the head, other companies use their money to make tv, radio, newspaper ads and no one seems to have an issue with it.. Blizz commission some dude to make a replica of a in game weapon and it is all torches and pitchforks mode.. <br />
<br />
Because how dare Blizz commission the making of this weapon instead of making in game content, but the last I saw it was not actually Blizz who were making this weapon some blacksmith dude is doing it.. But oh the humanity, oh no the sky is falling, really really sad that people are bitching about this..</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the actor isnt an orc either... everyone knows that orcs from azeroth universe would be ten times stronger than any human... <br />
Anduin Lothar was by far the biggest human warrior in recent warcraft history (descendant of the arathi bloodline) and even he was not as strong as Orgrim Doomhammer.<br />
<br />
I think that axe was a little bit too small... it looks like a proper size for a human warrior, not an orc.<br />
<br />
ps. strength doesnt matter much in a fight, but thats not the point... orcs are stronger than humans :P especially us soft-humans of real life.</div></div><hr />

It's MMO-champion. Anything that Blizzard does and get's posted here, the first pages will be filled with wannabe-trolls flaming on it.

I haven't played since the 2nd month of WoD but I still browse the forums hoping that I see something worth coming back for.<br />
There isn't a rule, but there is a difference between looking at news and posting just to shit talk the game. I don't like a lot of games, I don't go on their forums just to be obnoxious and insult the fans of the game.<br />
<br />
And it was already explained in this thread, but for anyone that isn't trolling, it isn't about the money allocated to this or the dev time that it doesn't take away from, its the fact that in a content drought where there is already a lot of discontent over the current state of the game, the stuff making headlines is this, april fools jokes, and features from other games. People want to see progress with WoD, and they aren't, so it makes them upset.<br />
Yeah, I agree that the game isn't perfect right now, I agree that there is little to no content. The point is this isn't the reason behind it. The reason behind it is laziness and greed. These things and the film and the other games have nothing to do with it.</div></div><hr />

They could've made it bigger and only add 5 more lbs. Probably weigh no more than 30lbs</div></div><hr />

Those aren't excuses, those are reasons. If a weapon weighs over 100 pounds, a person isn't going to realistically be able to wield it. You can make the excuse that it's an orcish weapon, and orcs could feasibly swing around a weapon that heavy, but orcs aren't real.<br />
<br />
And while I'm at it, squarely almost every weapon from any video game, not just WoW, are entirely impractical. From balance issues to protrusions that would harm the user, there's just no safe way to handle some of them in real life. It'd be one thing if the weapons Tony forged were purely for show, but his shtick is crafting them to be usable as well.</div></div><hr />

Please, it was not forging as it was not blacksmithing. Metalwork? Yes, but not blackmithing with forging. Why? Because it was a lightweight replica and not a proper weapon. Ok, was a small amount of smithing, but nothing too serious. Might sounds weird, but i know what i`m talking about. Back, when i was young i was active member of a knight order (as preservation of medieval historical traditions) and we used &quot;proper&quot; medieval gear (like chain armor made from stainless steel...was bloody heavy to wear and it was just the upper part..., long swords and long daggers, even a 2handed sword) <br />
<br />
Anyway we had close connection with metalworkers and smiths. A normal german 2 handed sword is between 1,5-4 kg for example: &quot;Two-Handed Infantry Sword with side-rings. No. 4437.Early 16th century. Total length 163 cm (64 inches), total weight 3.25 kg (6.5 pounds), blade length 125 cm, hilt length 38 cm, crosspiece length 38 cm. Blade's width at the shoulder 53mm, at the point 30 mm. Blade's thickness at the shoulder 8 mm, at the point 2 mm.&quot; and the heaviest what i know: <br />
Two-handed sword. No: LRK 16662.<br />
German, Late 16th century.<br />
Length: 1790 mm (70.4 inches)<br />
Blade: 1250 mm (49.2 inches)<br />
Weight: 4630 g (9.26 pounds)<br />
More information: http://www.thearma.org/essays/2HGS.html#.VSBwR_nF9Z0<br />
<br />
But if going to talk about axes, the most acknowledged 2 handed is the Viking Axe. Not even 2,5 kg in average... http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/viking_axe.htm</div></div><hr />

It's a novelty item though so I guess it doesn't really need a super-fine edge. It's probably dangerous enough as it is.</div></div><hr />

Lol he is not at the top of his field...he is the most know in media big difference.<br />
<br />
But ( as allaince player) i even find this a week version of gorehowl..the proportions seem off. and making everything out of metal makes it look to much forged.<br />
9/10 for making a nice looking weapon<br />
6 out of 10 for making it look like the real stuff</div></div><hr />

You're post made me Google some facts on swords and the normal weight of a sword used in battle was only 4-6 lbs, and here I always thought they weighed 50-100 lbs and the guys back then were just strong as hell lol</div></div><hr />

Did you not watch the video? The entire head of that Axe is hollow (3/16&quot; Steel, which is just a thick piece of sheet metal). It could have been bigger and it would still have been able to be lifted by most anyone that is somewhat physically fit.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy watching what they make but they get to be very repetitive regardless of what they're making. They make a pattern, do belt stuff, throw it in an oven, and dump it in oil. There are some episodes which inject a little more dialogue but it all falls in to a very tight pattern of instructions. <br />
<br />
Their take on Captain America's shield was sloppy and absolutely dreadful though.</div></div><hr />

But here we go - at the beginning guy brought to blacksmith POSTER of WoD.<br />
So question is - does posters ever exist in US? <br />
I got all of them (and all collectors) since vanilla, but wasn't able to find a single one for WoD.<br />
No Best Buy, no Game Stop - no store ever received WoD posters as they usually did years before.</div></div><hr />
