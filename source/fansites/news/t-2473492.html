We already have a vendor with azerite gear. So you want more vendor?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I rather have something I can work myself to and know in the end I will be rewarded than this slotmachine crap we have now that just makes me want to play less because EVERYTHING is RANDOM.<br />
Some RNG is fine, has always been, but todays WoW does not give me the sense of accomplishment as previous expansions have because the best gear I have I didn't really earn but was handed to me on a silver platter from some random WQ.</div></div><hr />

You know perfectly well I mean with all types of gear.<br />

The Azerite Vendor barely solves the issue with RNG.<br />

The team has no incentive to create content that is not fun just to pad subscription numbers.<br />
<br />
HAHAHHA.<br />
<br />
Well you been doing a good job of that lately boys. :)<br />
<br />
People tend to fixate on the Activitision investor lingo but this is not what the team focuses on when creating content.<br />
<br />
Sureeeeeeee you don't..... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
The team values how engaged the community is and how often they are logging in to do content. They want to create content based on feedback and community response.<br />
<br />
So the majority of the community told you to timegate content or 1 hour story quests hard and double down on RNG elements? Somehow I find that hard to believe.</div></div><hr />

None of the questions I would’ve liked to see were answered really but they’ve already talked about TF too much, they’ve talked about mythic raids being unrewarding atm. Not much they can really touch on now that I’d like to see I guess. <br />
<br />
As for people complaining about them not answering azerite/gear related questions, they already did. We know what’s happening with Azerite Armor in 8.2 and we know what’s happening with the neck as well. Just have to see how that plays out.</div></div><hr />

I'm totally for level squish, but it's really tough stuff to implement. Shitshow on forums will be same or bigger like with flying/no-flying. <br />
<br />
Many people will claim that Blizz is taking away their progress, they don't understand that it's just a number and Blizzard is &quot;taking&quot; your progress with every expac (now even every season).<br />

They give some decent answers in every Q&amp;A (and rest 70% is repeating stuff or some small news). Most people spiting venom here don't even watch these, they just read stuff from MMO-Champ front page.<br />
<br />
I am surprised though that they don't use 8.2 hype. They could do this QA in 1-2-3 weeks and focus more on 8.2 after it hit PTR.</div></div><hr />

You're dead-on about this - they are really goign to have to <br />
1) Do it exactly right, the first time.<br />
2) Ignore people who dont get the concept of a squish<br />
<br />
If they waffle or fail on either its going to be an epic shitshow 10x worse than the ilevel squish(es).<br />
<br />
History is not on their side, either, as both ilevel squishes have been clusterfucks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea this is one of the biggest issues BfA has brought with it. <br />
<br />
I think removing legendaries and shifting around AP sources along with adding seasons that work weirdly with current Azerite Armor everything just feels like POE/Diablo. You do shit in 1 season and it’s compeltley irrelavent/reset in the next. <br />
<br />
With legendaries you’d have incentive to go back and do older raids like EN/NH/etc. As much as I disliked the acquisition method this was a really positive aspect of the system. AP also had people farming m+ at all levels (5-15 were relavent) while giving even more incentive to go back and clear old raids. <br />
<br />
Hopefully they can come up with a way to fix this seasonal POE shit that’s going on. Moving AP back to m+/raids as the main source while adding something else to incentive running older content that’s within the current expansion would help greatly. That something could be transmog (like ToV) or a legendary-like system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only way to screw up would left required XP untouched and force people to grind Northend/Outland just to get few levels. So leveling should be around 30%-40% shorter. I think they should do this:<br />
<br />
- starting areas 1-20<br />
- Allied Races start at 20<br />
- EK/Kalimdor 20-40<br />
- Northend/Outland/Cata/Pandaria 40-50<br />
- WoD/Legion/BfA 50-60<br />
- DK start at 40<br />
- DH start at 50.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's clear those 2 don't even play the game anymore with how out of touch they are when it comes to it.<br />

It's a damn shame this game is now a soulless husk made only to please shareholders rather than players. Thankfully there are far superior MMORPGs on the market now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. Pretty much like this every Q and A. <br />
<br />
Usually it's the following.<br />
<br />
Answer nothing worthwhile.<br />
Give stupidly long answers to questions that didn't need it.<br />
Demonstrate how out of touch with the community they are.<br />
Act extremely arrogant about the game further proving they don't give a damn about making a quality product anymore.</div></div><hr />

There are nearly infinite ways for them to screw this up, scaling being the first and foremost among them (see: both ilevel squishes).</div></div><hr />

One good question about the game not feeling rewarding and they just keep acting as if it was a minor thing which they don't even mean to fix. GG Ion, that's it for me. There is actually no hope whatsoever that this shit will change in the future. What a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
JUST HAVE A VENDOR. Seriously stop with the arrogance already. <br />
<br />
There are a lot more viable loot acquisitions in the game outside of raiding than in the past.<br />
<br />
Such as? Unless half that other &quot;viable&quot; shit Titanforges which relies on RNG then no there's not.<br />
<br />
Seems it's gonna be another pitiful Q and A where nothing of value gets answered or important questions get garbage tier answers.<br />
<br />
There is a vendor for azerite already. Do you want everything on a vendor now? Besides that ties into the next point that Mythic + allows you to endlessly farm heroic quality loot with a near mythic piece of loot guaranteed every week as long as you're doing 10+. So... why do we want badge gear again? It's not like you were getting BiS from badge gear in the past anyways. <br />

He actually said he sold a trinket for thousands of gold back in Vanilla WoW to someone he brought along to BWL. Thousands of gold for a trinket at a time when the majority of people barely managed a few hundred gold. Okay Ion, I believe you. :rolleyes:<br />

Also the whole: <br />
- People tend to fixate on the Activitision investor lingo but this is not what the team focuses on when creating content.<br />
Followed by: <br />
- The team values how engaged the community is and how often they are logging in to do content.<br />
<br />
Yeah Ion, it's called Monthly Active Users. In other words, how often people are, you know, subscribed and logging in. It is &quot;investor lingo&quot; but it also is an extremely important metric on the health of the game. It should also be something you focus on when creating content because content that can't keep the MAU stable is most likely boring, generic content.</div></div><hr />

It's not like the levels are a problem as they have kept reducing the XP to next level and XP rewards totals since MoP and the stats squishes continue to throw the numbers all over the place until we end up back where we started. Not to mention the only reason they want to reduce the number of levels is to adjust when abilities/stat changes are given out whilst leveling from level one in order to make it &quot;more rewarding&quot; and will have barely any effect on a new expansion if they don't add any new abilities like the last two expansions (yes Legion had Artifact weapon abilities but we all knew they were temporary).</div></div><hr />

You're the one not debating. Why do you need badge gear when you can endlessly farm gear that would be badge gear ilvl equivalent? The only piece of gear that is really important to have on a vendor is on a vendor. What more do you want? Badge gear wouldn't solve anything really.</div></div><hr />

Vanilla WoW isn't today's WoW. Back then we didn't have WoD and Legion handing out gold on a table for NPCs to do for you. <br />
<br />
That has absolutely nothing to do with today's people being gold capped; having a single character, let along multiple characters gold capped wasn't really a thing back in Vanilla.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see a similar system to what they did with professions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AwkwardSquirtle</div><div class="date">2019-03-21, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm. I have thoughts on some of these.<br />
<br />
Gear reset by gaining 15 ilvls is fine. Gear reset of 15 ilvls over the current mythic gear is not. I think the OP in the Preach thread nailed down a tiered system that would solve this, where say LFR progresses from 350&gt;365&gt;380&gt;395 over an expansion, while mythic would go 380&gt;395&gt;410&gt;435. Everyone gets meaningful progression each tier, but you aren't getting upgrades from content that's trivial to you barring titanforges. <br />
<br />
Level squish gets a yes from me. Really solid point made that's often overlooked in the &quot;levelling isn't rewarding&quot; discussion that they can't give you 120 meaningful things. Call it elite levels, new chars are elite by default. We're elite mobs after taking down a titan. <br />
<br />
The rep argument is weak. World quests are limited, albeit less so than dailies. They're functionally the same for most players, who if anything will just clear their emissaries. If you no-life it of course you'll get more but you were more able to no-life dungeons than you are world quests. More importantly, you can cap dungeon rep too. Just grant it for the first clear in a week.<br />
<br />
Finally, give me Thal'kiel, he was as good a friend to me as Hati was to hunters, he at least talked. I miss him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Leveling would likely take the same amount of time, because each level would take longer. The benefit of the system would be 1. Potentially new players wouldn't see the level 120 cap and be intimidated and more importantly 2. You'd get either a new talent or ability every level as opposed to now where you go vast stretches of levels with nothing new to play with.</div></div><hr />

Because getting six pairs of bracers in six runs feels a lot worse when you just want ANY pair of boots, but no boots are being given to you.<br />
<br />
It doesn't have to be the best. It just has to give people ilevel so they can get into groups. They could have a vendor that only sold Mythic+5 gear (not hard to earn whatsoever) which costs currency (say, if you do a +10 you get one piece of your choice from your chest a week - Otherwise 15 +10s gets you an extra piece) and it'd be better than all the RnG bullshit they want to throw at us.</div></div><hr />

ooooh baby i know a lot of people who would have pay 60 dollars to a full insta 60 on Vanilla haahhahaha. Let just give the team time to figure it out what lvls are the ones that matter, personally i would said 70-80 its the level cap, the best levels, 80 to be very accurated with WoTLK, those where the best max lvls.<br />
<br />
The rest makes sense, Blizzard experimented with a lot of things this expa, some of them dont work others are good and the ones that need fixing are now or are going to be reworked (AKA 8.2 collar) so yeah not bad Q&amp;A.<br />

Basically, Blizzard's main problem here: they won't stop trying to please everyone (and pleasing hardly anyone as a result).<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll finally learn that ditching the core, consistent audience they built from the ground-up to target flakes who come and go on a whim wasn't the best direction for WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is some merit to their words.<br />
<br />
It doesn't feel good to go up 5-10 levels and not see any difference in your character. At that point, are you even getting better? You might have better gear, but has your character progressed in any meaningful way to you yet? Not unless you just hit 120.<br />
<br />
Even up to WoD, we had a decent spread of abilities at every level range until 90. Then it seems Blizzard got concerned that they had given players too much stuff, and had to take most of it away 'to simplify things.'<br />
<br />
I don't agree it needed to be simplified, but they did it anyway, and are now realizing a long leveling experience doesn't feel good without SOME kind of reward for leveling.</div></div><hr />

there are better way to fix it(scaling was a good start) the 300% exp potions should have stayed and made slightly easier to get. There should be way more Heirlooms that give exp(every piece should give exp in my opinion)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In both Legion and BFA, the total rep you can earn per day has been MAJORLY reduced. (in 3 dailies in Wrath, MoP, or otherwise, the average rep per day was, at minimum, 750 rep - That was generally in 3-4 quests as opposed to the 10 world quests it would now take to get the same amount.)<br />
<br />
In WoD, there were no dailies for rep. Only rep grinds. As opposed to a limited 750 rep per day in 3 dailies, you had to kill 750 mobs in a specific area for rep, which was much slower.<br />
<br />
Dailies didn't even exist at all until BC, and not as actual daily HUBS until Wrath.<br />
<br />
So no, you can't claim it's been the same since Classic.</div></div><hr />

Forgive me if I interpret you wrongly, but it seems like your fixes just make the leveling experience shorter. After all, that's what exp heirlooms and potions do. What Ion is talking about is making it more fun, such that leveling feels like part of character development, rather than something to be suffered through.</div></div><hr />

level squish and speed of leveling is independent of each other, so they could do both or either.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darknessvamp</div><div class="date">2019-03-21, 07:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Level squish gets a yes from me. Really solid point made that's often overlooked in the &quot;levelling isn't rewarding&quot; discussion that they can't give you 120 meaningful things. Call it elite levels, new chars are elite by default. We're elite mobs after taking down a titan. <br />
<br />
<br />
Leveling would likely take the same amount of time, because each level would take longer. The benefit of the system would be 1. Potentially new players wouldn't see the level 120 cap and be intimidated and more importantly 2. You'd get either a new talent or ability every level as opposed to now where you go vast stretches of levels with nothing new to play with.<br />
<br />
Leveling isn't rewarding as level and item level scaling mobs has gotten rid of the feeling of getting stronger until you're HC raiding or Mythic Dungeon running in the latest content patch and can start to blow stuff up again. We've never had enough abilities in the game to get something every level (vanilla had ranks for spells which were slight upgrades over previous ones and had to be bought at a trainer) and if they did squish the level cap down to 60-70 or something whilst reshuffling when abilities are delivered we'll just be stuck with regaining the same abilities again but with an even longer time between getting them. For example, we have most of our abilities that our class gets, barring talents and masteries, around level 70, after a level squish we might have them all around level 60 which would take around the same time as getting to level 100-105. <br />
<br />
As to a level squish making the 120 grind no longer seem as daunting, I'd disagree. Since WoW has a trial up to level 20 new players are able to get a sense of how difficult it is to level up in WoW (not at all) and considering classic will be out soon and a new player is just as likely to try that as WoW, they'll be quick to find the 1-20 grind far harder and longer and know 20-60 would be just as intense. Having both retail and classic cap out at level 60 then would be far more intimidating to a new player comparing the grind between the two games. Honestly if the level 120 was such a deterrent for new players to join the game then Blizzard could just increase the trial to level 60 and lock the character upon reaching that until the player subs, it takes about 2 days to do atm anyway and would give new players the idea that they have made significant progress already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd much rather have fewer levels that meant more, than the current system... Imagine being able to entirely skip Outland and Northrend, what a dream! Sure the 1-60 and Cata 85+ zones are still outdated and shitty AF, but perhaps it'd be possible to go MoP forward much faster anyway.<br />

Color me shocked, seeing as how if players don't want to login and do content, the game won't thrive. Alas, obviously the crowd of Negative Nags will continue preaching the opposite to support their feels.</div></div><hr />

(in 3 dailies in Wrath, MoP, or otherwise, the average rep per day was, at minimum, 750 rep - That was generally in 3-4 quests as opposed to the 10 world quests it would now take to get the same amount.)<br />
<br />
In WoD, there were no dailies for rep. Only rep grinds. As opposed to a limited 750 rep per day in 3 dailies, you had to kill 750 mobs in a specific area for rep, which was much slower.<br />
<br />
Dailies didn't even exist at all until BC, and not as actual daily HUBS until Wrath.<br />
<br />
So no, you can't claim it's been the same since Classic.<br />
<br />
You may notice the word daily doesn’t show up in my post even a single time. <br />
<br />
The core way to get some rep in all of the expans I listed was out door content rather that be daily’s or grinding and the total rep gained per day hasn’t stayed the same across expans. Yes legion and bfa gives you less daily rep but with the boxes being put in they also made it easier to gain rep with out having to do over 10 daily’s a day like in mop or just sit around grinding mobs.<br />

So yes outdoor content has been a constant for all of wow baring cata.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. I was against it at first, but the idea of getting things when leveling up again is pretty tempting. The only thing I'd want to make sure they don't do is remove MORE abilities so they can do this and have you 'earn them back' with the next level up bracket.<br />

-The team did not like what Warlords and Legion did to the economy and tried to pull back in BfA. They have reintroduced gold rewards after some changes in the beginning of the expansion such as the emissary rewards.<br />

<br />
These seem exclusive to one another. Maybe not in a vacuum, but players coming out of WoD and Legion have literal millions stashed away. It's still causing a major disruption between how much you can earn right now and how much the stuff actually costs on the AH. Runes early on are 600g a piece, even if you'd get 3 gold emissaries in a week and your treasure map gave the 5k mission, you'd still be out of gold in less than 20 pulls.<br />

Yes legion and bfa gives you less daily rep but with the boxes being put in they also made it easier to gain rep with out having to do over 10 daily’s a day like in mop or just sit around grinding mobs.<br />
<br />
So yes outdoor content has been a constant for all of wow baring cata.<br />
<br />
&quot;They changed literally every aspect of outdoor content - That's why outdoor content is the exact same!&quot;<br />
<br />
Really, I don't know what to say here... Dailies were the way to get rep in most expansions - Both BC and MoP, with very few expansions, the major reps in these expansions were tied to dailies. Wrath introduced dungeon rep and that continued into Cata, but both had the problem of the rep being worthless after a few days since people farmed to exalted and never touched them again - Hence why they won't return to that. So looking at the past, knowing they WON'T do dungeon rep again, we have:<br />
Classic, which was the same as WoD in that all reps were just mob grinds/turn ins.<br />
BC/MoP, dailies.<br />
Legion/BfA, world quests.<br />
<br />
People hated and felt WoD reps had no use. People complained about the boxes and rep in Legion, they continued doing so in BfA. The fact of the matter is, the boxes DON'T HELP. 1500 rep once weekly is still only 2 days of rep back in the day, which you could do EVERY DAY, not maybe twice if you're lucky this week.<br />
<br />
So let's do some math:<br />
5 world quests (if you're lucky enough to have that many each day, spoiler: almost no single zone has 10 world quests up at a time each and every day) x 7 days = 70 world quests to get 2625 rep + 1500 rep once weekly when the box comes up<br />
3 dailies x 7 days = 21 TOTAL quests, 5250 rep<br />
<br />
The only thing you could even remotely argue is the travel time got longer, since you just go to world quests instead of accepting each quest at a hub. But now you're flying all around a zone where previously you flew to one general clump of a zone, completed all three quests, and turned all three in. All World Quests are spread out throughout the entire zone, so even that is disingenuous at best. AND you got more weekly rep without the box by just doing dailies!<br />
<br />
It takes longer to get the same daily rep, and then they choose to limit that rep to how many world quests a day, and to top it all off, they give us a box and hope that's enough to sate you. Unfortunately, it appears it worked on you.</div></div><hr />

Forgive me if I interpret you wrongly, but it seems like your fixes just make the leveling experience shorter. After all, that's what exp heirlooms and potions do.

Bingo.<br />
It pays also to remember that the more WoW advanced, the more scaling became big. Most skills in Vanilla had a fixed base plus a percentage of AP or SP (that was nearly always considerably inferior to 100 % ; for example, Eviscerate had only 25 % of AP increasing the damage). Today, it's directly the AP/SP value multiplied by a rating which is used, which means that even with the exact same value in AP/SP, you're doing MUCH more damage/healing than you would have in Vanilla.<br />

<br />
Really, I don't know what to say here... People complained about the boxes and rep in Legion, they continued doing so in BfA. The fact of the matter is, the boxes DON'T HELP. 1500 rep once weekly is still only 2 days of rep back in the day, which you could do EVERY DAY, not maybe twice if you're lucky this week.<br />
<br />
So let's do some math:<br />
10 world quests (if you're lucky enough to have that many each day, spoiler: almost no single zone has 10 world quests up at a time each day) x 7 days = 70 world quests to get 5250 rep + 1500 rep once weekly when the box comes up<br />
3 dailies x 7 days = 21 TOTAL quests, 5250 rep<br />

<br />
You really seemed to have missed the point. Yes getting individual rep is slower I agreed with you on that in my other post. How ever with the box’s give you a large chunk of rep for I think every faction though out the week with less time investment per day. For people with less time to play or who dislike questing/daily’s this is a better system. <br />
<br />
But I really don’t care about the hard numbers if it was just about that then every rep would be better off being like wods where you could just mindlessly grind mobs all day which is a god awful player experience if you ask me.<br />
<br />
But all of that is secondary to my original point that rep has almost always been focused on out door content which hasn’t changed rather that be daily’s world quest or mob grinding. So unless you want to argue that some how keeping the focus where it’s always has been is some how Disgraceful like the original claim it seems we agree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a lot more viable loot acquisitions in the game outside of raiding than in the past.<br />
Guess I'm old school, because I don't believe you should be able to get raid-quality gear outside of actually raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team has experimented with many different ranges for item level increase between raid tiers and have found the current 15 item levels is the minimum that they can do to make the jump from tier to tier feel relevant.<br />
The item level difference was 13 for the longest time, so I find this rather odd. And I don't think this would be an issue if they'd just remove titanforging and return warforging back to how it worked in MoP. Chance of that happening is pretty much nil, however.<br />
<br />
<br />
People tend to fixate on the Activitision investor lingo but this is not what the team focuses on when creating content.<br />
I direct you to a video of NetEase reps talking to Blizzard devs about how to monetize Diablo: Immortal. That's not to say the above bullet is false, but it would be ignorant to believe that making money doesn't play a significant (if less so in comparison) part.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team doesn't want secondary stats to be perfectly equal for classes so there is some decision making and enjoyment from seeing good stats on gear, but they want the gaps between secondary stat importance to be narrow.<br />
When it comes to secondary stats, I'll always have fond memories of how it worked for enhance shaman during the days of Icecrown Citadel. You could choose to focus on slower/heavier attacks versus faster/lighter attacks. I miss that.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Caverns of Time portal is being added to the portal hubs in the next update.<br />
It's almost like it never should have been removed in the first place. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
The ability to hide the chest slot will be added in the next update.<br />
A long term project is to loosen some restrictions over time so players can have more self expression.<br />
Chest is good. Better: hands or wrists. Best: hide any and all slots. As for other restrictions, what exactly are they talking about?<br />
<br />
<br />
The team wants to increase customization options such as eye color in the near future.<br />
Having eye color tied to face type and/or skin color never made sense to me even during classic WoW. Very hopeful about this, along with other things such as tattoos and scars for the older races.<br />
<br />
<br />
A height option is more complicated and most likely not happening.<br />
I can believe it. We had to wait longer than initially planned for &quot;Kul Tiran&quot; humans and the models still had problems upon going live.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are no new Allied Races in Rise of Azshara.<br />
Thank goodness. There's already enough so-called Allied Races, some of which should have been done as new customization for classic races (looking at you, Mag'har orc and Dark Iron dwarf). I want us to get back to having actual new races for expansion packs.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team has heavily discussed a level squish lately. They want community feedback on if losing levels would feel bad even if they could give more valuable rewards at every level in the leveling process.<br />
Unlike my hate towards level scaling, this... I feel much more mixed about. 120 levels is a lot and can be daunting for both new and old-timers alike, but &quot;losing&quot; levels would suck even if it's purely psychological in nature. I hope the devs will share their ideas with the WoW community instead of waiting until it's cemented, at least.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team did not like what Warlords and Legion did to the economy and tried to pull back in BfA. They have reintroduced gold rewards after some changes in the beginning of the expansion such as the emissary rewards.<br />
You were warned for WoD. You did nothing. You were warned again for Legion. You still did nothing. Cry me a river.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is pretty happy with the encounter designs in Battle for Dazar'alor.<br />
Why was it necessary to do a full-blown faction change instead of cosmetic for this raid? Mages can't use any factional teleport/portal spells, profession-restricted gear is screwed (although it may have been hotfixed since), losing racials which I then have to add back later to my bar, unable to use any faction toys, my chat window gets spammed... list goes on. To quote my twin: &quot;WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
It is unlikely that reputation will be awarded for just doing dungeons because it is mostly tied to the outdoor content. They don't want chaining dungeons to be the most practical method of obtaining reputation.<br />
That is unfortunate. Doing dungeons are rather unrewarding outside of M+.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other Legion artifact personalities could return in the future. Hati was an outlier because it was a beloved companion specific to hunters.<br />
Speak for yourself, I hated Hati on my BM hunter. I might have been able to like Hati a little if they had stuck with the planned original WotLK model instead of the ugly WoD model, but no.<br />
<br />
<br />
Xal'atath was an interesting character and the team wanted to dive into her story more which is why she has returned.<br />
I like her voice actress but Xal'atath never felt interesting to me. But then, I was pretty lukewarm about Legion artifacts in general. (34 weapons of legend coming outta nowhere? Really? At least Doomhammer and Ashbringer had a long history.)</div></div><hr />

Linear was what Saphyron calculated, where +1 ilvl always adds the same amount of stat, so the total ilvl increases at the same pace and so 210 ilvl is 5 % more than 200 ilvl.<br />
<br />
Exponential means that the higher you total ilvl is, the bigger the amount of stat +1 ilvl adds. So if 200 to 210 means +10 % budget, and 400 to 410 also means +10 % budget, despite the first being an increase of 5 % in ilvl and the second being 2,5 %, it means that each +1 ilvl between 400 and 410 added much more stat than each +1 ilvl between 200 and 210. So, exponential.<br />
<br />
So yes, what you describe is exponential. AND it's exactly what I calculated in my list, which is why you get +110% stat between 530 and 640, while a linear increase would lead to only gaining less than 20%.</div></div><hr />

Legion: (Dungeon 805-910) 105% increase (Raid 835-970) 135% increase<br />
BfA: (Dungeon 310-410) 70% increase and counting (Raid 340-425) 85% increase and counting.<br />
<br />
I did not include level up dungeons. Also, your percentages are massively wrong.<br />
An 85% increase in the last one would result in the end result being:<br />
340 * 1,85 = 629 ilvl<br />

&quot;The team&quot; is wrong on this, and it's killing the game, but they're quadrupling down on a bad idea. You can't micromanage a player's experience. You just can't. If they can't or won't see this, it will continue to destroy the community they claim to want to support. <br />

<br />
<br />
The team wants to put the emphasis of community back into WoW.<br />
<br />
Implied admission that it was your fumble fingered decisions that removed it, requiring it to be brought back. <br />
<br />
And, I'll believe it when I see it. Your track record here speaks for itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team did not like what Warlords and Legion did to the economy<br />
<br />
Translation: &quot;The team realizes now that the low effort carrot of easy gold that was used to lure players back in Legion, after the dumpster fire of WOD, came back to bite them on the ass.&quot;<br />
<br />
What I dislike about this, is they're blaming the ocean of gold on the economy - not their actual design decisions. The gold didn't magically appear in people's inventory. <br />
<br />
<br />
It is unlikely that reputation will be awarded for just doing dungeons because it is mostly tied to the outdoor content. They don't want chaining dungeons to be the most practical method of obtaining reputation.<br />
<br />
Why can't it be both? Why can't a player have agency, and determine the best and most fun path for them, towards a goal? Or is it because you know, from having full access to the metrics in the game, you fully know that people will stop doing your shiny, new, and utterly boring world content, if they can get the same rewards doing dungeons, which from all accounts is pretty good in BfA? <br />
<br />
Nah, that can't be it. Because world quests are so much fun, even though they're pretty much universally complained about now, from the players. Yeah, that can't be why. That's crazy talk. <br />

We've never had enough abilities in the game to get something every level (vanilla had ranks for spells which were slight upgrades over previous ones and had to be bought at a trainer) and if they did squish the level cap down to 60-70 or something whilst reshuffling when abilities are delivered we'll just be stuck with regaining the same abilities again but with an even longer time between getting them. For example, we have most of our abilities that our class gets, barring talents and masteries, around level 70, after a level squish we might have them all around level 60 which would take around the same time as getting to level 100-105.<br />
<br />
It's not about time, I'm talking about it meaning something when you ding (or sploosh if you're Lore). <br />
Spell ranks actually exist again to some extent, adding new features to abilities (sprint doesn't waterwalk until about 60 now, for instance).<br />
You're right that it will take longer to get all your stuff. That's the point. Right now while levelling there's nothing to look forward to once you hit level 90.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the one hand, having a number lower than 100 on my max level character panel would be nice.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I am 99% sure they'll also make the experience needed to level up go higher. I played through Cata and MoP, and despite all the praises I sing for MoP, going through those expansions' entire leveling experience while gaining only five levels (per expansion) made the leveling experience feel... slow and sluggish.<br />
<br />
I don't think it solves the problem. The problem is the daunting, massive amount of content to slog through to level cap, made worse with a new expansion feature that requires it, to play. They're addressing the leveling issue too late, there's too much of it to deal with effectively.<br />
<br />
I think a better solution would be to chop every up to Wrath out of the game. Make all of that content exclusive to Classic. Start the retail game in Cataclysm, when they changed the whole world, anyway. Drop the level cap to 60. <br />
<br />
That's where they're headed with Classic, anyway. Bite the bullet, do it now. Start new players off in Cata. They could simply keep the Dreanei and Blood Elf and DK starting zones as instances, and dump them off in the capital cities with the breadcrumb quests into cata. <br />
<br />
Expecting players to go through this many expansions is insanity. That train left the station, derailed and crashed into the canyon a long time ago. They might even get a tick in new players if they did that.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I agree with this. Have gear that can be infused with higher level gear to keep old stuff relevant. Even legendaries and cool old set bonuses. Like Destiny 2, have old raids also capped at a certain iLVL, so even if your gear is higher, going back to do it your ilvl gets placed at the max ilvl of that raid so the content still remains 'fun'. Not a cap that is so low that the content becomes a slog again, but so it's worth doing for fun and importantly a greater focus on mechanics and co-ordination wise for difficulty. <br />
<br />
Squish the level cap down to 60, but instead of increasing or scaling the experience to be the same as 1-120, change the levelling entirely to be able to level from 1 to 60 in one expansion's content (eg. one catalysm expansion's quest chains) At least then new players wont find it super daunting to level from 20-120 but instead can reach max level quicker and enjoy the other content. Scale all the other expansions and provide an incentive for doing the quests other than experience. Eg. completion of wotlk even though you're already level 60 easily from catalysm levelling rewards a mount or I would even go as far as a 2nd rank to your abilities etc. Maybe even introduce paragon system where after level 60 cap, any experience gained goes towards very minor increases similar to Diablo. This creates a sense of progression on YOUR character. Outside of gear. Outside of farming the same WQs and raids for items immediately replaced. A long term increase to your own character.<br />
<br />
As someone else also said. Blizzard has been trying to micromanage our player experiences for a few years now and it's gone to shit. You cannot micromanage experiences It'll feel fake and unrewarding or just plain straight up not fun. How many times has blizzard told us that it's FUN to do the quest chains to unlock WQs. It'll be FUN to add these shitty affixes to M+. Rather than micromanaging our experiences and shoving FUN down our throats they need to make good content again and we, the players, can determine for ourselves what is actually enjoyable. Example: AQ Gates Event, they didn't make that content to micromanage the players to do certain types of content and farming but created because it was a cool, large scale, epic event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, so that's why a single fucking stupid potion requires 20 herbs to make and, depending on server, costs anywhere between 200 and 500 gold. Unless their definition of 'normal gameplay' is 'farming herbs for 6 hours per week' or 'raiding for 1 hour and never using more than 5 pots per week', something isn't fucking adding up. <br />
<br />
It's fucking ridiculous how a single raid night costs at least 10k these days - which is a very generously low number, 20k is probably way closer to reality with 40 300g pots per night, a bunch of flasks, food, repairs and maybe even runes/vantus. Add that up to 3 raids a week and you're looking at 50k+every single week. I fail to see how pathetic 2k gold emissaries twice a week, 5k gold paragon caches every other week and the super awesome 60g worldquests are supposed to cover that, like, at fucking all.<br />
<br />
It's getting close to impossible to sustain raid nights without offering sellruns. They should've reduced the cost of pots by like 75% 6 months ago - they should've never got rid of fucking prolonged power potions in the first place. But I totally get it, giving people 2k gold every once in a while totally makes up for pots requiring 20 motherfucking herbs, totally sustainable through normal gameplay.</div></div><hr />

Not really they could make it happen so you can level much faster just doing 1 zone each past expansion still of doing all the other ones. At least for alts. <br />

Just clean up the level ranges for zones, maybe link together all the most important story quests into a &quot;main scenario&quot; campaign of some sort that gives boosted experience and speeds you to max level.<br />

This was actually my question (Bearfat) and I'm disappointed they didn't address this. They said they want an iLvl upgrade of 15 for a new tier, except it's actually 30 for the same difficulty level.

Unless their definition of 'normal gameplay' is 'farming herbs for 6 hours per week' or 'raiding for 1 hour and never using more than 5 pots per week', something isn't fucking adding up. <br />
<br />
It's fucking ridiculous how a single raid night costs at least 10k these days - which is a very generously low number, 20k is probably way closer to reality with 40 300g pots per night, a bunch of flasks, food, repairs and maybe even runes/vantus. Add that up to 3 raids a week and you're looking at 50k+every single week. I fail to see how pathetic 2k gold emissaries twice a week, 5k gold paragon caches every other week and the super awesome 60g worldquests are supposed to cover that, like, at fucking all.<br />
<br />
It's getting close to impossible to sustain raid nights without offering sellruns. They should've reduced the cost of pots by like 75% 6 months ago - they should've never got rid of fucking prolonged power potions in the first place. But I totally get it, giving people 2k gold every once in a while totally makes up for pots requiring 20 motherfucking herbs, totally sustainable through normal gameplay.<br />
<br />
/place tinfoil hat<br />
<br />
It's so people who don't even have the time to farm herbs and have lives buy a WoW token and buy potions, as well as those people who I see out herbing regularly that are multiboxing. The only people who gain anything from things being like this are not raiders, the people most likely to burn through gold out of anyone.<br />

Start by removing sharding / forced crz for non warmode zones, bring back server communities ffs. Connect more realms together, merge servers, do something that isn't fucking half assed for once Blizzard.Forced CRZ and Sharding are terrible systems, go look at the classic wow forums to see most don't like sharding or forcing people into crz. fuck this company is run by a bunch of morons when they are getting feedback non stop and they just don't listen. When i last played last year i never saw anyone from my realm which had a high population at the time.

Basically, Blizzard's main problem here: they won't stop trying to please everyone (and pleasing hardly anyone as a result).<br />
<br />
<br />
What's funny about that is WoW is probably the worst single-player RPG out there. If my choices mattered and they actually affected the story I'd be a hell of a lot more invested in WoW. <br />

The squish is to make leveling look and feel less daunting. The truth is that, more than likely, Blizz will lower XP gains to very minute levels. <br />
Even if Blizz lowers level cap to level 50, it’s still going to take the 22+ hours to level to that as it does to get to 120.<br />
The benefits come from feeling that it’s not as long as well as giving Blizzard the ability to give us talents at a faster rate. It also means the possibility of talentbtrees coming back like what we had from Vanilla-Wrath.<br />
There is the possibility the pros will outweigh the cons, but I really don’t see the leveling process going faster.</div></div><hr />

This. I hope to god they never do it. 120 is not a big number. If they are so worried about leveling taking so long just lessen the amount required per level or make every 3rd level a &quot;free&quot; level. I want WoW to feel like it's been out for 15 years. I want to feel like its grown and power has increased. I don't want to feel like I am playing Classic WoW by being level 60/70. I loved being level 110 in Legion and hitting for really big numbers.

That we should be fine with how much gold we're making by simply playing the game. Well Ion, I didn't do emissaries back in Legion and I still managed to make 400k+ gold before BFA released. Now doing the same ol' stuff that I've been doing, I'm at 80k gold. I hate that smug look on his face when you can tell he's lying and knows they're bleeding the playerbase just so he can say &quot;Well you can just buy a WoW token and make gold that way.&quot;<br />
<br />
I completely agree, in legion i was starting to rack up enough gold that i wanted to save up for the lightforged warframe. However now its impossible because i spend all my gold/war resources on re rolls for all my characters since they also decided to bump up the price of those. (why the hell not huh we don't want players getting as much loot). Increase in re roll tokens and flasks feeling mandatory paired with the INSANE exponential growth for reforging pieces (thanks for punishing me for enjoying multiple specs btw, thought you would like that someone likes every spec of a class but apparently not) i feel like im practically forced to buy a WOW token as I watch my gold deplete faster than i can make it (even with farming for herbs and ore on my druid).</div></div><hr />

Same, my boyfriend and I have recently gotten his 3 friends to join WoW so we can have a full group for Mythic+ along with his brother who is a huge PvP guy. Recently I have been growing more than I ever thought I would after getting AOTC jaina and progressing further and further into mythic. This being said, although I am addicted to mount farming and grinding both dungeons and raids, I would never accept a level squish and neither would any of the people I play with. <br />
I don't want to play classic. :mad:<br />
I feel like people are trying to force it even if its subconsciously. I love seeing I am 120 it makes me feel like the games been out for a while, which it has. They don't need to do a lvl squish and upset a huge part of their player base when they could easily just keep making xp gains better which would make lvling faster.<br />
If they do a lvl squish, all 6 of us are un-subbing.</div></div><hr />

i dont care about whiners who have problems with big numbers - those 120 levels is something which i worked a long long time over last 15 years. if they squished it i would feel robbed out of all this time . just so that jimmy raider could level his n-alt faster. <br />

It is unlikely that reputation will be awarded for just doing dungeons because it is mostly tied to the outdoor content. They don't want chaining dungeons to be the most practical method of obtaining reputation.<br />

Yeah gotta keep people on that sub hook with emissaries and 75 rep world quests....<br />

Disgraceful.<br />

Are you serious ? I was exalted after 2 weeks max and I never &quot;cleaned&quot; the WQ map, NEVER... I dont care about alts at all because rep for alt is useless anyway<br />
<br />
BFA is far from perfect but seriously, the people here... no one in my guild is whining like you and we're enjoying the game, no one is forced to play everyday, most of people play less than me and I dont even play everyday (I skip 1-2 days when we're not raiding to play other games ect)...

(in 3 dailies in Wrath, MoP, or otherwise, the average rep per day was, at minimum, 750 rep - That was generally in 3-4 quests as opposed to the 10 world quests it would now take to get the same amount.)<br />
<br />
In WoD, there were no dailies for rep. Only rep grinds. As opposed to a limited 750 rep per day in 3 dailies, you had to kill 750 mobs in a specific area for rep, which was much slower.<br />
<br />
Dailies didn't even exist at all until BC, and not as actual daily HUBS until Wrath.<br />
<br />
So no, you can't claim it's been the same since Classic.<br />
<br />

I'm enjoying current wow... I got bored in wotlk a lot more quickly outside of raids (no mm+, nothing to really farm, just a few boring dailies)... :/<br />

It's totally not bullshit WoW &quot;used&quot; to be good and fun before they started all their bullcrap pruning, FFXIV is quite possibly 10 times more fun to play than current iteration of WoW, Though personally I have given up on the MMO genre much better games to play out there ie The Division 2, Devil may cry 5, hell Apex has more quality assurance than this piece of shit game.<br />

It's all opinions as I said to the previous poster WoW used to be a fun great game that I'd play for hours, its a piece of shit compared to what it used to be and I'm not talking about the QoL changes I'm talking about the blatant bias and the crappy pruning they did making classes feel hollow compared to how they originally started out no sense of progression it's all been removed.</div></div><hr />

Unless their definition of 'normal gameplay' is 'farming herbs for 6 hours per week' or 'raiding for 1 hour and never using more than 5 pots per week', something isn't fucking adding up. <br />
<br />
It's fucking ridiculous how a single raid night costs at least 10k these days - which is a very generously low number, 20k is probably way closer to reality with 40 300g pots per night, a bunch of flasks, food, repairs and maybe even runes/vantus. Add that up to 3 raids a week and you're looking at 50k+every single week. I fail to see how pathetic 2k gold emissaries twice a week, 5k gold paragon caches every other week and the super awesome 60g worldquests are supposed to cover that, like, at fucking all.<br />
<br />
It's getting close to impossible to sustain raid nights without offering sellruns. They should've reduced the cost of pots by like 75% 6 months ago - they should've never got rid of fucking prolonged power potions in the first place. But I totally get it, giving people 2k gold every once in a while totally makes up for pots requiring 20 motherfucking herbs, totally sustainable through normal gameplay.<br />
<br />
I feel you, I want to use potions but it's expensive as fuck, I'm losing some DPS but for now only food and elixirs. Legion was perfect for the Pre-pots, easy to make and used by every class, if it's to cheap maybe put in a little more to the system of legion, but it was very good for raiding.</div></div><hr />

There are a lot more viable loot acquisitions in the game outside of raiding than in the past.<br />
The team is working on tech to make the mythic + cache at the end of the week less random.<br />
The team is actively trying to figure out how to lessen moments that feel bad without making everything a vendor.We noticed, but just who asked you to do it? Never &quot;more&quot; means better, it should be &quot;enough&quot;, but not more, well since this boundary has been crossed long ago (https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17616993631?page=14#post-280), so... draw conclusions. &quot;Less random&quot; doesn't mean &quot;not random&quot;, so nothing changes here too. &quot;Without making everything a vendor&quot; - using determinant loot table without dungeons have some kind of &quot;old world drop&quot;, scaling to spec/lvl/ilvl and t/w-forge $hit, like it always was before. Say no to loot (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandora%27s_box)-boxes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning#Video_games)! (http://www.jagodibuja.com/2019/04/living-with-hipstergirl-and-gamergirl-no-373-english/) What (https://thumbs.gfycat.com/BlondSeriousHoneybadger-small.gif)?:) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loot_box) I begin to suspect that friends' conclusions (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2472050-Preach-on-the-broken-gear-treadmill?p=50960269#post50960269) about game tokens aren't just a logical warm-up/brain's training, but very much fair statements.<br />
~<br />
Gear Reset and Catch Up<br />
The team has experimented with many different ranges for item level increase between raid tiers and have found the current 15 item levels is the minimum that they can do to make the jump from tier to tier feel relevant.<br />
It’s just that team is stubborn to impossible level and doesn't want to use mechanism that allowed it to be avoided in (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2380324-PvP-Normalization-is-an-RPG-and-Game-Design-Failure?p=48967858#post48967858) the (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2455097-Well-here-we-go-again-Blizzard-are-stretching-that-taffy?p=50598165#post50598165) past (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2462591-So-item-levels-are-getting-spiked-for-no-reason-Again?p=50759626&amp;viewfull=1#post50759626) (again without scaling to everything, t/wf (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2450288-Titanforging-is-here-to-stay?p=50571743&amp;viewfull=1#post50571743), millions of difficulties (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2452106-All-these-difficulties-Right-or-wrong?p=50538110&amp;viewfull=1#post50538110) etc.), which means, that team, as a group of devs, is worthless.<br />
~<br />
Fun and Enjoyment<br />
The team has no incentive to create content that is not fun just to pad subscription numbers.<br />
People tend to fixate on the Activitision investor lingo but this is not what the team focuses on when creating content.<br />
The team values how engaged the community is and how often they are logging in to do content. They want to create content based on feedback and community response.<br />
There are many different play styles and ways people enjoy the game. What works for some people doesn't always work for others.&quot;Has no initiative&quot;, but continue with doing it, you should learn to finish :rolleyes: The rest of what has been said is so... I don’t even know how to call it, may be - “useless”, since those who have long ceased to believe in sincerity of these your words will only laugh, and rest will pass by without even noticing (by the way, the last one is an artificial (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2462091-WoW-is-pulling-a-HotS?p=50981881#post50981881) problem, contrived, organized by devs themselves (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2423772-Everything-wrong-with-WoW-today?p=50005439&amp;viewfull=1#post50005439), this doesn't justify any your actions at all, we remembered it only yesterday and here you are, this fake (http://www.jagodibuja.com/webcomic-living-with-hipstergirl-and-gamergirl-english/91english/) childish naive innocence again :p nonono)<br />
~<br />
PvP RewardsAs mentioned before (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2438009-Gear-doesn-t-matter-anymore-at-all?p=50263875&amp;viewfull=1#post50263875): without proper characteristics, currency and venders (= having goal and choice), not to mention correct base class design (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2462079-If-Blizzard-had-reverted-to-the-old-talent-system?p=50744025&amp;viewfull=1#post50744025), all this is useless air shaking.<br />
~<br />
Stat Importance<br />
Starting in Legion, the ratio of stats on gear shifted more to primary stats as you progress further into the end game.<br />
The team doesn't want secondary stats to be perfectly equal for classes so there is some decision making and enjoyment from seeing good stats on gear, but they want the gaps between secondary stat importance to be narrow.Well, does only in Legion? It's interesting that last time (again (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2462591-So-item-levels-are-getting-spiked-for-no-reason-Again?p=50759626&amp;viewfull=1#post50759626)) same as now it remains to be obvious mistake. You're simply accelerating faster and faster theme under second quote. Look carefully, don't break to death with such &quot;statements&quot;.<br />
~<br />
Portal Removal Feedback | Transmog | Character Customization | Allied Races | Leveling ... Gold bla-bla-bla, doesn't matter, since models stays same $hit without customization allowing (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1556655-Female-Draenei-Model-Old-vs-New?p=33524767&amp;viewfull=1#post33524767) them resemble original (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2342358-Human-Female?p=48129206&amp;viewfull=1#post48129206) ones (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2458827-display-old-character-models-profession-level-up-with-boost?p=50674075&amp;viewfull=1#post50674075) - doesn't make any help for me, again useless stuff, you don't know anything about leveling since your system doesn't (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2446923-Poll-how-do-you-feel-about-level-squish?p=50433891&amp;viewfull=1#post50433891) provide (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2462079-If-Blizzard-had-reverted-to-the-old-talent-system?p=50747553&amp;viewfull=1#post50747553) useful stuff associated with it = so doesn't even have any sense to ponder in everything being said, and your attitude to gold is already in a sense revealed by the last link under first quote.<br />
~<br />
Reputation in Dungeons<br />
It is unlikely that reputation will be awarded for just doing dungeons because it is mostly tied to the outdoor content. They don't want chaining dungeons to be the most practical method of obtaining reputation.<br />
In the past they had reputation in dungeons because of the limited amount of dailies. With world quests, there are more ways to earn rep now.So can you add &quot;tokens&quot; to reputations for endless deliver without restrictions on farm place (wherever it drops out)? (Ie, as it was normaly done always before dominance &quot;monetization&quot; over design) But no, of course not, there always (https://youtu.be/qAIrj_Vqdfc?t=51) should be time gate now!:p</div></div><hr />

LOL So for you FF14 has more subs than wow ? What are you smoking, I want the same. But ffs, most people who've played at least 1 month after release are exalted in every BFA faction reputation (yes people who want BOTH factions exalted would need to play more...)<br />
<br />
No one and I say NO ONE has a sub to only get exalted to play allied races. AR are just reskin of existing races it's a &quot;nice&quot; bonus but its no way something that keeps you playing... If not then you're just ultra casual even more casual than the average casual player... <br />
<br />
I've played FF14 for a few months and all the grindy things are WORSE, the WQ are even more boring than wow WQ, and you can even do dungeons with bots instead of players...<br />
<br />
I still fail to understand what you &quot;loose&quot; wwith a simple level squish. Content from older expansions always becomes obsolete, thats how wow has always been. If you don't like it then why did you still play this game after BC ? BC &quot;destoyed&quot; vanilla content.<br />

Its 20 plants per potions but you get at least 5 plants per spawn... it doesnt change almost anything, I farm 2h/week of 3 raiding nights and I prepot + use a pot every single pull/wipe...

I remember farming dungeons to get some loot that would help me to get into raiding.<br />
They were not BiS but they were good enough to give you enough boost and ilvls.<br />
<br />
Because players being in any sort of control of gearing is bad according to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
And it doesn't help the people defending the game are telling them that this RNG fiasco is ok.<br />
<br />
Vendors are fine. There is no downside to them. Partly why I prefer FF14. Yes gearing is way more straight forward but there's no godawful crap like Titanforging or relying on heavy RNG.<br />
<br />
Hell they literally have systems in place to prevent RNG. Each time you clear a Savage raid wing you get a token which is weekly. Once you get 4-8 of these tokens you can get an armor piece ranging from accessories or chest pieces or w/e. Basically bad luck protection. And hell if you get what you need from the raid within those 4-8 weeks you can then instead spend those on an alt job.<br />
<br />
As for currency it's basically the same as Justice and Valor was. One uncapped currency that goes upto 2k and another capped one at 450 per week (soon to be 900) that goes upto 2k.<br />
<br />
I agree FF14 gearing is a lot more simple and can appear boring but that's why I like it. I'm not at the mercy of RNG or Titanforging for the most part. Hell crap like Titanforging doesn't even exist in this game because the devs know it's a stupid idea.<br />

<br />
You want a helm you want, but you cannot get it to drop from boss X. You end up getting helms you don't want on a different boss or lower ilvl helms you dont need. You end up getting 4-6 helms saved up. Go to this one ethereal that can take all the unwanted gear you have and forge a special orb/coin/item. <br />
Every helm that goes into this specific orb increases the chance I get a helm from the boss after I kill it until it's 100%. Anything past 100% increases the chance it is warforged or even titanforged so that nothing is wasted.<br />
<br />
The best way to go about it is a point system that converts to percent. Say normal helms give 15 points, heroic helms give 30 points, and mythic helms give 60 points. A helm that isn't your class's armor type gives 1/3rd the points (normal - 5, heroic - 10, mythic - 20) so that you can still funnel gear but it's much less effective than just giving it to the intended classes.<br />
<br />
To fill up the orb thingie that will give me gear you need to put in the following points. Just putting in random numbers.<br />
<br />
Normal orb - 80 points<br />
Heroic orb - 120 points<br />
Mythic orb - 200 points. <br />
<br />
Say I'm a druid doing heroic and I want this heroic helm really badly. I have 3 leather helms from my heroic run, and the raid throws me 2 heroic plate helms and 2 normal cloth helms to increase my chances. I go to the ethereal dude and he gives me an orb for all the items. I get (30 + 30 + 30 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5) 120 points which gives me a 100% chance to get a helm if I use that item after I kill a boss. I kill boss Fuckwad-that-never-drops-my-gear and the orb now starts to glow in my inventory. I use it and BOOM! 100% guaranteed drop I get the helm on that boss.<br />
<br />
Now add in M+ gear ratings and numbers, and at the end of a mythic+ run someone can use the orb after beating a dungeon. Loot box opens up with the various helms you can win. You can ONLY PICK ONE. It has a pop up window that confirms that is the item you want and after confirming, boom you get it. <br />

I figure if they're going to try to refuse to do a vendor, then at least give something where we can still get a guaranteed item. Figure since they love RNG, bake that RNG into a system where we get a &quot;bad luck protection&quot; system where we can save them all up and eventually get the item we want. <br />
<br />
It also makes it so that you can't just save up all the items you want and then &quot;Oh new raid or mythic is unlocked. Let's use them all at the start to get the end boss gear&quot; because you have to use it on the boss you kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want a helm you want, but you cannot get it to drop from boss X. You end up getting helms you don't want on a different boss or lower ilvl helms you dont need. You end up getting 4-6 helms saved up. Go to this one ethereal that can take all the unwanted gear you have and forge a special orb/coin/item. <br />
Every helm that goes into this specific orb increases the chance I get a helm from the boss after I kill it until it's 100%. Anything past 100% increases the chance it is warforged or even titanforged so that nothing is wasted.<br />
<br />
The best way to go about it is a point system that converts to percent. Say normal helms give 15 points, heroic helms give 30 points, and mythic helms give 60 points. A helm that isn't your class's armor type gives 1/3rd the points (normal - 5, heroic - 10, mythic - 20) so that you can still funnel gear but it's much less effective than just giving it to the intended classes.<br />
<br />
To fill up the orb thingie that will give me gear you need to put in the following points. Just putting in random numbers.<br />
<br />
Normal orb - 80 points<br />
Heroic orb - 120 points<br />
Mythic orb - 200 points. <br />
<br />
Say I'm a druid doing heroic and I want this heroic helm really badly. I have 3 leather helms from my heroic run, and the raid throws me 2 heroic plate helms and 2 normal cloth helms to increase my chances. I go to the ethereal dude and he gives me an orb for all the items. I get (30 + 30 + 30 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5) 120 points which gives me a 100% chance to get a helm if I use that item after I kill a boss. I kill boss Fuckwad-that-never-drops-my-gear and the orb now starts to glow in my inventory. I use it and BOOM! 100% guaranteed drop I get the helm on that boss.<br />
<br />
Now add in M+ gear ratings and numbers, and at the end of a mythic+ run someone can use the orb after beating a dungeon. Loot box opens up with the various helms you can win. You can ONLY PICK ONE. It has a pop up window that confirms that is the item you want and after confirming, boom you get it. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone can think of a downside to my system please give criticism or concerns.<br />
<br />
But they don't want you get what you want. They want you stay and try every week to get what you want with RNG low chance. There is a milion ways how loot system can work better, but they want this way and they are quite happy with it and that is the problem.</div></div><hr />

Just have the cache ONLY pick from the HIGHEST keystone you ran that week. If you ran multiple of the same skill level, you'd either need a tiebreaker of best time, keep them all in the roll, or just select on the mythic dungeon key screen. Any of the 3 would be acceptable to me. This would allow players to target a specific dungeon. You'd still have SOME RNG, but it would remove a lot of the &quot;slot machine&quot; aspect of the cache.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its nonsense - they removed gold missions because people werent buying tokens enough <br />
<br />
unless you are one of those naive people who belive that tokens prices are regulated by players.<br />
<br />
No no, i think you're 100% right.</div></div><hr />
