<br />
Developers’ notes: The net result of the two Combat Potency and Fortune Strikes changes is that Combat Potency should generate half as much Energy, twice as often.<br />

Subtlety<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Our overall goals are to remove uncontrolled player teleport from the baseline DPS rotation, to reduce the frequency of teleporting in PvP, to allow players to choose between more frequent or more impactful Shadow Dances, which equates to more frequent CC/utility or damage in PvP, to keep the PvE rotation engaging, and to make Symbols of Death more engaging.<br />

<br />
Master of Shadows (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/196976) now gains 25 Energy over 3 seconds when you enter Stealth or Shadow Dance.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Pooling energy going into a Shadow Dance has long been the way to play Subtlety, and we’d like to bring that back. This design still gives you more energy for a Shadow Dance, but in a way that allows the Rogue to fully utilize pooling gameplay.<br />
<br />

<br />
Developers’ notes: This aims to remove maintaining Nightblade on every target from your AOE rotation on 4+ targets. Instead, Subtlety will deal increased damage during AOE by focusing it into one target.<br />
<br />

people reviled demon blades because of the inconsistency, and they fixed it on ptr and then reverted it back to what was before, and no there is no viable alternative to demon blades, and personally i havent seen a demon hunter play anything except demon blades in mythic raids ever(might be that you know a lot of people who just play lfr/normal/hc for fun)...</div></div><hr />

Well yeah, they take it because its the best DPS talent. Same with affli and soul effigy, doesn't mean they enjoy it. But I heard MANY, MANY complaints that Demon Blades just makes the class too simplistic, not that its inconsistent.</div></div><hr />

the other alternative does not make the class more complicated to play or more interesting, it is even more boring... it's just spamming a fury generating ability that takes a gcd and does 0 dmg</div></div><hr />

I was seriously expecting to see fire get a load of changes, not a 2s duration extension on a non-scaling secondary stat proc. As a former fire mage turned feral, i feel for you guys and hope that someday soon you get to move away from the frost spec you've been bottlenecked into for way too long. <br />
<br />
Speaking of poor changes:<br />
<br />
Feral<br />
<br />
Soul of the Forest now causes your finishing moves to deal 5% increased damage and grant 5 Energy per combo point.<br />
<br />
Just keep playing with this one blizzard and someday it just might spot Savage Roar on the horizon. Seriously though, If you want ferals (all 1000 of us worldwide) to have an alternative to Savage Roar, stop giving us alternatives that aren't viable. A 5% damage bonus on finishing moves only coupled with 25 energy [CP *5] (down from 60 energy [CP * 12] i'll add) doesn't mean squat compared to the flat all-around 25% damage increase of Savage Roar. This is a change that will go largely ignored by the majority of ferals because it wasn't viable before, and it still isn't with this change. <br />
<br />
The only benefit to Soul of the Forest is if you're new to the spec looking to ease your rotation into spending CPs on only RIP and Ferocious Bite, however this will only ensure you have no chance at performing optimally. While the Ferocious Bite +30% DMG change will be wonderful once we get out 4-piece out of TOS, i recommend completely forgetting that Soul of the Forest even exists and continue to spec for Savage Roar.</div></div><hr />

That's a very interesting note actually. The Soul of the Archdruid ring (http://ptr.wowhead.com/item=151636/soul-of-the-archdruid) was something i totally missed, but it looks like they've excluded this one in the patch notes, I wonder if it'll actually make it to live.

Right now Whispers proc scales with ilvl unlike a pure secondary stat. That's why it goes up by several percentage with ilvl, and in timewalking gives 0%. Now that it scales like a secondary stat the increase/decrease won't be as much with ilvl. This is to prevent a very high titanforged proc as ilvls go up to give an insane amount of casting speed bonus.</div></div><hr />

But seriously, do not expect these dimwits to have any idea about what the actual flock they're doing. They've stopped actually playing/designing Feral cats since early Cata. They just mash a few buttons at random every time they almost hit a deadline of content patch release and call that a 'Feral balance fix'.</div></div><hr />

It feels really shitty already on this treadmill, and now stuff is going even quicker. We're going into the next raid weaker than we were before it came out. ??? Shouldn't our power only go up with time?</div></div><hr />

They're just drops like all the other legendaries. It wouldn't make a particularly interesting bullet point.</div></div><hr />

- All right guys, Unholy was one of the worst specs in NH, what should we do?<br />
- Give them 5% all damage, buff Death Coil, and also buff some talents none of them use, and probably won't use even after these buffs! So basically we're just giving them +5% damage and the DC buff! Gonna be epic! <br />
<br />
Seriously, this wouldn't save Unholy even if NO other DPS spec would get buffs. But they do. So yeah my money is on Unholy being in the bottom 5 specs in ToS too.<br />
<br />
But ofc we have pr0 UHDKs here with different opinions (and can support it with anything apart from &quot;lol you're retarded&quot; and stuff like that), I'm all ears.</div></div><hr />

They were suppose to make &quot;big changes&quot; and solve the RNG problem of the spec. Dafuq did they actually do? Buff Slice &amp; Dice? :D</div></div><hr />

With the right gear (legendaries, trinkets and tier 20 set) i think Unholy is going to be in a pretty good place in ToS. If Unholy is in the top of the charts in a months time, i will remind you of your comment ;)</div></div><hr />

Well &quot;if history proves me wrong&quot; I'll be the happiest DK out there, lol :)<br />
I raided as a WW monk in WoD, and as I was bored of playing a broken class, I rerolled DK in Legion... Only to see it sink to the bottom of the list after the good start in the begining of EN. I'm not asking Unholy to be in the top 3 specs, but jumping to, and staying in (maybe upper) &quot;middle of the pack&quot; would be very welcome from my pov.</div></div><hr />
