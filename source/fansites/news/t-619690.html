<br />
Blizzard crying &quot;we don't want you to only spec axe and stack crit&quot;.<br />
<br />
Well how about making sword spec not utter toss by comparison to the other 2, instead of de-synergising the whole freaking rend+overpower leading to execute thing into a bunch of random, half decent examples of purest mediocrity?<br />
<br />
Even with the buff to scaling on rend, with the decrease in the talent, it will just once again become the gimp dot of fail, or identical to how it is now but why bother with the whole overpower rubbish if it's got no bonus to help proc sudden death at all anymore? Especially when you could choose to spend another two talent points on overpower's cooldown. Now it'll be the same, dull as watching paint dry trash that it was before.<br />

Overbudget or not, the initial quote said that the overall benefit was not changing. According to the info on this post, they either lied or changed their minds. I am actually just wanting to make sure that the post itself isn't in error.<br />
<br />
Look at this:<br />
<br />
Earth and Moon changed from 5 to 3 ranks and now increases spell damage taken by 4/9/13% for 12 seconds and increases your spell damage by 1/2/3%. (Old - Increased Arcane/Fire/Frost/Nature/Shadow damage by 3/5/8%)<br />
<br />
If the old one was 5 ranks and the new one is 3 ranks, why is the 'old' effect showing 3 ranks only on its effect? That just leads me more to believe that this is an error in one way or another.</div></div><hr />

Well how about making sword spec not utter toss by comparison to the other 2, instead of de-synergising the whole freaking rend+overpower leading to execute thing into a bunch of random, half decent examples of purest mediocrity?<br />
<br />
Even with the buff to scaling on rend, with the decrease in the talent, it will just once again become the gimp dot of fail, or identical to how it is now but why bother with the whole overpower rubbish if it's got no bonus to help proc sudden death at all anymore? Especially when you could choose to spend another two talent points on overpower's cooldown. Now it'll be the same, dull as watching paint dry trash that it was before.<br />

<br />
<br />
It really, really won't proc anywhere near as much. Especially for axe users. If everyone was running around in raids with a buffed critrate of only 33%, then it would proc as much. But given that people generally have crits of over 40%, and closer to 50% with an axe, it's just a flat out nerf. <br />
<br />
<br />
And to someone saying the talent now affects whole amount of rend? The tooltip is identical for these patch notes as it is in live. As in, +% to bleed damage on rend. So either you've done some testing on beta and then also counted the difference in from new scaling, or you're just making something up.<br />
<br />
And, even if rend got buffed to 1000 ticks, with sudden death a talent you can't influence whatsoever with gear, it's just another boring p.o.s. instead of something that bounces you between several buttons.<br />
<br />
Right now on live, it was simply a lot more fun to be doing dps in PvE as arms than it ever was before. You actually wanted to apply rend, for the purpose of hopefully setting off a chain reaction of rend -&gt; overpower crit -&gt; sudden death. You had slam, MS, overpower, execute, bladestorm buttons to press that wouldn't be set in stone but you knew you wanted to press them. <br />
<br />
With 3.0.3, you go back to being MS, slam bladestorm/WW. rinse repeat, get bored in the face and wonder why they bothered changing things in the first place.<br />
<br />
DULL DULL DULL.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2008-10-18, 04:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh shutup! 9% chance ion a HIT is great in PvP, toned down for PvE as it was contributing too much to Dps for a 3 talent point.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrong for a couple of reasons.<br />
<br />
Firstly even if we take a situation where attacks never miss or are dodged parried then 3/6/9% on hit would be the same as a 10/20/30% on crit chance for a warrior with 27% crit chance. It doesn't take spectacular gear for a raid buffed warrior to be pushing 40% crit chance so this is a pretty substantial nerf. Of the order of a 33% nerf in the proc chance of the ability even looking at a 100% hit, 0% parry, 0% dodge situation. If you consider the synergy with overpower, then in the same situation the crit chance of overpower is 90% (with 40% base crit and 2/2 imp. overpower). This takes the chance of proccing sudden death when you use overpower from 27% with the current version down to 9% with the new version. This is a 67% reduction in the number of procs of sudden death you will see.<br />
<br />
So a raid buffed warrior is going to see somewhere between a 33% and a 66% reduction in the number of sudden death procs which is a pretty substantial nerf considering the message from blizzard was that the proc rate was supposed to remain the same but with less of an overall requirement to focus gear on crit. Even that is at a relatively low crit chance for a raiding DPS warrior. If you start pushing towards 50% crit chance the nerf will be much more pronounced.<br />
<br />
Secondly, by claiming making it work on hit instead of on crit is a PvP buff you are demonstrating a basic misunderstanding of how &quot;on crit&quot; abilities work in PvP. If your opponent has resillience which reduce your chance to crit them it makes no difference to the rate at which &quot;on crit&quot; abilities proc. So if you have 30% crit chance and your opponents resillience reduces that to an effective 20% crit chance you will still proc &quot;on crit&quot; abilities from 30% of your attacks. This change was made soon after TBC to prevent the effective double nerf effect resillience was having on any &quot;on crit&quot; procs. Also, in PvP burst damage is far greater than sustained damage, even if the overall number of sudden death procs would remain the same it would still be slightly less useful since an execute after a crit will always be better than an execute after a hit in PvP simply by virtue of being a bigger burst. For PvP if they remove the burst nature they actually need to increase the proc rate to compensate.<br />
<br />
If you want to argue that the nerf is justified then go ahead but arguing that it isn't a nerf is just plain wrong and claiming it is better for PvP just shows your ignorance of PvP mechanics.<br />
<br />
From playing and raiding as arms since the patch my impression is that the damage is very nice but incredibly random. Sometimes you get lots of procs and crits and burst out insane damage, sometimes you don't and get pretty low damage.<br />
<br />
At those low numbers the best thing to do would be to make the proc chance increase the longer you go without a proc. 3/6/9% chance increasing by 1/2/3% for each attack that doesn't proc. So if 5 attacks in a row don't proc you have a 24% chance your next attack will proc. Even that would be a lower proc rate overall but it would remove some of the RNG dependence of arms right now and help reduce those situations where you are on full rage for a long time just praying for a proc to help end the rage wastage.<br />
<br />
As for the &quot;it was contributing too much to dps for a 3 point talent argument&quot; that may well be so, but PvE arms DPS certainly isn't particularly high. Unless they make up the lost DPS elsewhere Arms will end up taking quite a DPS hit due to this change.<br />
<br />
There is also the fun aspect. Once proc rates get low enough there isn't much real fun in working with them. The fun in Arms right now is much to do with prioritising your procs when they overlap. The fact that sudden death synergises so well with overpower made for some nice combinations. The rage return was built in to further that, you can sudden death, overpower with the rage returned and maybe proc sudden death again. The fact that the two facilitated each other worked well.<br />
<br />
If the problem was that Axe spec is better than the other two specs the best thing to do is to fix that. Removing an interesting and fun skill synergy because the weapon specs are a bit imbalanced is a bit daft. The reason Axe spec is popular is that it is just plain better than sword or mace spec right now. This change won't affect that. Rebalancing the three weapon specs might. Giving sword spec a 1/2/3/4/5 increase in expertise and mace spec back its extra rage generation would have fixed the problem just as well but without the loss in fun.<br />
<br />

steady shot doesn't clip aim shot. And you must be a fucking awful hunter if you aren't doing 2000-3000 DPS after the patch.

Lemme put it to you this way. My 0/21/40 warlock could do 1700 dps with a single bloodlust in 2.4.3 and ZERO 25 man gear. Yes, ZERO bt/hyjal gear and ZERO sunwell gear. Nothing but badge gear, ZA gear, and a kara piece or two. I've done this multiple times on single target boss fights, with a bad group and no bloodlust I bottom out at around 1400 dps.<br />
<br />
After 3.0 hit, my DPS barely changed, maybe went up 100-200. I now get rocked by equally geared hunters, and beaten by moonkins, ret pallies, and the occasional rogue/mage/arms warrior. Talking about comparable gear classes, of course. And as I said, I am pushing 1800, they can push 25% more, easy.<br />
<br />
2000 is cake. (For Hunters.)</div></div><hr />

I thought they were just going to reduce the talent from 5 points to 3 points yet keep the top level effect the same. In fact the link to the previous post about these changes specifically says it is keeping the overall effect the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
Um...thats exactly how I understand it to be. You will get the same effect with only three points in E&amp;M as you did with five points. Its a significant buff. imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's nothing less then yet another insult to read the amazing patch notes for locks. I always wonder what tooltip or minor glyph changes they are throwing to our broken class. At least I can play my other classes just like they want med to do.<br />
<br />
Give us DKs already in exhange for our locks and be done with it once and for all. No need anymore to keep the charade up.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
QFT<br />
<br />
its really sad, i loved my lock, was my first char to lvl 70, was looking forward to dusting him off and lvling him agian. BUT Blizz seemed to have other plans for my warlock, like to continue to collect dust, i was hoping they would get an Fing clue by how many warlocks were not playing anymore, but i guess not...right after the patch i speced him out a few times tried some new stuff gave it my all and... blah. <br />
<br />
next point<br />
ret pallys barely got hit by this patch at all, its kinda obvious a class is way OP when on my server all day spamming the trade chat was...<br />
LF RetPally for 2v2s<br />
LF RetPally for 3v3s<br />
LF RetPally for 5v5s<br />

Sorry to stray from the focus of most people on this thread, but are Inscriptors looking at this? <br />

What is the verdict here - is this a money maker, or is it devaluing the profession? One major reason for considering Inscription was the BoP items, but if others can make them for me, is there much point?</div></div><hr />

I find it an odd change too. Starting to think the only reason to level inscription was to make heaps of gold the first few days after the patch. I might drop it and roll something else once the market bottoms out.</div></div><hr />

Now the market is flooded with Glyphs and soon people will stop to bother to put them on ah. Inscription needs lots of inventory spaces and has nothing that another profession can't give you. It is nice to have on an alt but as profession on Main it is just fail. But well, payed like 500g on herbs to max it for the moment and got 12k out of it, so it wasn't a bad deal ;-)</div></div><hr />

What does the tooltip say for Divine storm, Rightous vengences, Art of War and Crusade after the change? One of the things I am concerned about, are we going to be spending 5 talent point to get a skill that warrior gets for 3? And from the rumours, ours deal LOWER DMG and it dispelable, cause if this happens to be the case, I for one will be skipping the talent all together, get more survivability in prot tree.</div></div><hr />

I find this quite disappointing. I'd hoped that Blizzard would consider developing a profession such as Inscription, which has huge potential, in a manner which would entice people to stick with it beyond the initial AH market spike.<br />
<br />
If all the worthwhile items are going to be BoE, it scarcely seems logical to drop another crafting profession such as tailoring (which took an age and thousands of gold to level) or a gathering profession such as herbalism (which benefits both Inscription and Alchemy) in order to take it up.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have further information on this? Is it the case, such as with JC, that many rare (and the occasional epic) Inscription items will be BoE but the more sought-after items will be designated BoP?</div></div><hr />
