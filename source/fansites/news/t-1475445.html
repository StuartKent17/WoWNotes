Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews<br />
There were a few developer interviews at the recent press events, so today we are taking a look at interviews with Alex Afrasiabi from Gameplanet (http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=V8P4xSFOj0M).<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
You won't be allowed to fly in Draenor at release, and the devs want to see how players react to this. <br />
Afrasiabi also mentions that he thinks it is possible that players could love a world with no flying. <br />
Garrisons will change the way the game plays, making it feel new.<br />
<br />
<br />
Draenor<br />
<br />
Iron Horde will be coming through the Dark Portal in the weeks coming up to the expansion release.<br />
Upon arrival to Draenor, players will go through a 45 minute experience to try and turn off the Dark Portal to save Azeroth. <br />
You will see why the enemy is so bad right right away, as well as why you must stop them.<br />
When Garrosh goes back to Draenor, he still thinks he is a great savior. He wants to show the world the might of a united Orc front.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Flying in Warlords of Draenor<br />
One of the statements from the interview above prompted some discussion on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1472455-Possibly-no-flying-throughout-entire-xpac) about the possibility of no flying at all in Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Hearthsteed Colors<br />
You may remember that the Hearthsteed mount was added to the game with both red and blue variations. So far, everyone has received the blue version for trying out Hearthstone (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3829-Ride-Into-Action-on-Your-Hearthsteed!). It appears the red version still may show up in the future though! <br />

Hotfix Bug<br />
You nerfed Flying Serpent Kick for FC'ing but you didn't nerf Burst of Speed? <br />
This was unintentional (an unexpected side effect of a different hotfix). We're working on correcting the issue now. Once that's done, Monks should once again be able to use Roll, Chi Torpedo, and Flying Serpent Kick while carrying the flag. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/299266-you-nerfed-flying-serpent-kick-for-fcing/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12032733378?page=4#67))<br />
<br />
<br />
Hearthsteed Issues<br />
If you have having troubles with procuring this mount, try this!<br />
<br />
1) Be sure to win 3 games of Hearthstone in PLAY or ARENA mode first! Your 3 wins can be from Casual or Ranked play. The introductory missions do not count. You'll know it's your third win because you'll get the &quot;Mount Up!&quot; quest reward notification in Hearthstone!<br />
<br />
2) Log into World of Warcraft and check your mail. No Hearthsteed to be seen? Go to the next step!<br />
<br />
3) Log out of World of Warcraft and log in to Hearthstone one more time.<br />
<br />
4) Log out of Hearthstone and log back in to World of Warcraft. Check your mail - your Hearthsteed should await!<br />
<br />

http://blue.mmo-champion.com/public/style_images/master/tracker/flags/gb-en.png Free Character Migrations Available (EU)<br />
If you're on one of the source realms listed below, you can move your characters to one of the designated destination realms and avoid the queues—for free!<br />
<br />
By initiating one of these transfers, you will be moving your character to a new realm and home. This is a one-time, one-way move. If you wish to move your character elsewhere, you will need to use the paid transfer service (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/services/pct-select.html?).<br />
<br />
<br />
Silvermoon =&gt; Magtheridon / Azuremyst<br />
Kazzak / Outland / Stormscale =&gt; Auchindoun<br />
<br />
<br />
Please be aware that, due to the unpredictable nature of free transfers, we may close down any Free Character Migrations at any time and without warning if the target realm becomes full. If you plan to move with friends or your guild, we suggest that you coordinate the effort to reduce the chance of any stragglers being left behind.<br />
<br />
Early closures aside, this set of Free Character Migrations will end on Tuesday, March 18<br />
<br />
Begin a Free Character Migration now (https://eu.battle.net/account/management/wow/fcm/character-list.html?r=EU&amp;l=WoW1)! We recommend reviewing the FAQ (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/free-character-migration), as it details what is or isn't allowed for transferred characters.<br />

That is what people will say. I will be very happy that no flying is being done. bring back the vanilla days. <br />
Maybe you can increase mount speed just for Draenor only. Maybe 10-20%</div></div><hr />

I'm honestly not resubbing until they allow us to choose a new face for free after the conversion. Giving us the option to disable all new models is not an acceptable compromise.</div></div><hr />

It's bad enough they're practically saying &quot;we can't design content around flying that's immersive&quot; as that's completely untrue. Even moreso that people think &quot;flying mounts ruined the game.&quot;<br />

You aren't having it taken away. You can still fly in every other area you currently are able to. You just aren't getting the additional, that's all. You paid to fly in Azeroth, Outland, Northrend, and Pandaria. You have yet to have it taken away on Draenor because you never got it on Draenor. ;P</div></div><hr />

We'll have to see how we all feel about it in Warlords. I'm not saying Unsub(Cause that's a bit harsh to do). Giving constructive feedback will. Usually I would say getting rid of flying is silly but I don't know how Warlords of Draenor will be in terms of gameplay so it might be different. This is my personal feelings on this. Once I do, part of me hopes I change my mind, the other is concerned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can see blizzard implementing no flying mounts but than the general population will complain/threaten to quit.. and they will bring them back.. sadly. Let them do what they think is best for the game people! As World of Warcraft was created by people passionate about gaming.. for people who love gaming...</div></div><hr />

You'll still be able to use your flying, just not in the Draenor world.<br />

<br />
Also, I remember one of the dev's saying why its not at release is because they don't want people bunny hopping from quest to quest and skipping so much with flying mounts, they want to provide immersion, and its rather selfish that people would complain about it, I know for a fact the vast majority of veteran players will appreciate it, maybe the young-ens can learn to also. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />

Oh I totally get it, I'm a Druid, and being that one of my classes abilities is null and void for a patch, on top of not being able to use my shiney mounts, does suck, but I also see it from the view that, all that gold spent on flying in the past was for those specific expansions, every expansion, something changes, and we have to pay for flying again, till next expansion, so it's meh to me. <br />
<br />
I think honestly, we should wait and see, I mean they are building this expansion around ground mounts, where as before the expansions were built around having flyers, so they may have new and interesting stuff that will hook us into ground movement, I'm willing to wait and get some info from Beta before going mental over not having flight for a patch or more, if they don't do the ground mount environment justice, then I will be the first over on their forums telling them they might have got it wrong:)</div></div><hr />

Whats funny is the fact that most of the blizzard store mounts were marketed as also being flyers. So those mounts will only have like half animation in the new expansion. I also for see them making faction cities with full AH and other amenities in WoD content so those areas will become new hubs where players gather and thus not using their flying mounts there either. Good thing I didn't hop on the WoD pre-order bandwagon. I'm definitely going to wait and see how this plays out. No flying mounts in WoD and I am definitely not going to enjoy it. I really dislike being forced to use a ground mount for an entire expansion. At least in MoP Im limited only to the 2 islands so I can actually explore pandaria the way I want to.</div></div><hr />

Elsewhere someone suggested there would be no crafted gear in this xpac either. This raises doubts in my mind about the direction the entire game is taking. I'll play WoD and check it out, but I suspect it'll be my last xpac. It's not that I'm going to ragequit over flying, but it just sounds like the current design team doesn't even have a concept of what sorts of things I enjoy in this game.</div></div><hr />

I remember paying 600g for all my and brothers toons epic riding back in BC, and that was a lot harder to come by than 10k these days. Not to forget how even much harder it was in Vanilla. If they design the zones and quests around not being able to fly then it shouldn't be a huge major inconvenience. <br />

So when you want to go to your farm when you're in shrine do you hop on your ground mount and head over to the gate towards krasarang?

No, but if they do this for the entire expansion at the same time they're rewarding flying mounts and still have them in the store that's a bit beyond rude. After all, the expansion is where everyone at end game--nearly everyone in other words--is supposed to be. I don't have so much of a problem with the no flying stuff but handing out flying mounts for the Hearthstone achievement at exactly the same time as they're talking possibly not allowing flying at all in the expansion is pretty stupid too from a messaging standpoint.</div></div><hr />

Im not a hardcore raider, i get my enjoyment from professions, levelling, generally playing around in the game from point to point. No flight would admittedly massively hinder my patience for the game having to dodge and avoid mobs, find a way up &lt;insert random hill here&gt; just to reach the node above it.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong im not rallying for mass sub-quits, just think this is a bit of a mad statement for Blizz to make already. To me it seems its just a way to try make content last longer than it otherwise would at the risk of alienating its audience.<br />
<br />
And to the people stating flying mounts are useable on the ground, you try mounting Ashes in a no-fly-zone and then come back to tell us that. Some mounts are rideable on the ground, others not so much. IF blizz decide to follow through with this, they at LEAST have to make all mounts ground rideable in my opinion, EVERY MOUNT.<br />
<br />
And to the person a few posts above stating about only going to Orgri to use the AH - other than farming old raids or doing archaeology, i havent had to leave Pandaria at all as my main is an Engineer, can use the Shrine's AH robot. So being stuck in Draenor with no reason to go back to the old world other than the once a week mount farm, doesnt sound like a very good prospect to look forward to.<br />

I guess Blizzard is ultimately at fault, though. Allowing unrestricted flying was the worst thing they ever did when you think about how entitled this community acts. It's impossible to go back without whiners raiding you.<br />
<br />
They need to start thinking about restricted flying instead of disabling it all together. The game needs it. Limited amount of time in the air before having to land, with a cooldown before you can fly again. Increase the speed of ground mounts slightly. Make certain zones or areas annoying for flying mounts, like the Monstrous Kaliri in Terokkar Forest that would dismount you all the time. Hell, even reward those that choose to use ground mounts with buffs that only work when you haven't used a flying mount for so long while questing.</div></div><hr />

Really? That is your answer? He never said anything about content, why do you make things up? Exploring? In WoW? Don't make me laugh.<br />
<br />
No flying is dumb and I'm just waiting for the storm of QQ that is coming, because actually many people don't even know about it yet, only the regulars on MMOC and the official forums. I'm betting if they don't get rid of that &quot;super&quot; idea and just restrict flying until cap, it won't probably last even until the first patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
STOP THINKING FOR US!!!<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Your players.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but there's no way in hell I could love a world w/o flying. I was really excited back years and years ago when I got my first flight form...And someone else said it right - we levelled up to get it, we PAID for it, and now you want to tell us that we &quot;might like&quot; not being able to use the ability I've dropped over 10k on? No. No thanks. You can fuck right off.<br />
<br />
I want. Mah batform.<br />
<br />
I have dropped over 200k on flying mount training alone, how about you quit your bitching and act like an adult. This game has been failing for years, ever since the middle of WotLK WoW has become less and less like itself. It has lost it's soul. Kinda evident by the 7M people leaving. Blizzard knows this, and now that Ghostcrawler is gone they can finally get to business and do some real work. <br />
<br />
How about you shut up and see how it is first before you hate on it.<br />
<br />
Christ, these forums are turning into bigger and bigger bitchfests for crybabies every day.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Bigger trolls too it seems, if you have seen WoW as a failed experience for the past what, 4-5 years? Why are you still playing, why have you spent 200k on mount training, and why are you even slightly bothered about the next expac?<br />
<br />
I'm not playing, haven't played since the end of Cata. The reason I'm bothered about Warlords of Draenor is because WoW is a game that I have put a LOT of time and effort into ever since vanilla launch, and I still hope that Blizzard will be able to give people at least 1 good expansion pack before giving up on it entirely. I also hate trains, but I find monorails very exciting and interesting.<br />
<br />
I'm so sorry if my interest in a game hurts your feelings, I will try not to ruin your mental wellbeing with my other posts. I'll send you a check to pay for any damages. My sincerest apologies to you and your family. <br />
<br />
How about you shut your ass and let the grown ups talk, you know, those who actually know what the hell they're talking about.</div></div><hr />

There is no room for flying in an mmo. Perhaps in one or two zones of old continent.<br />
Shouldn't be able to fly over the creation that had taken years to make. We are supposed to live there. Not cheat mode hover our way over it.<br />

Nah, it's Blizzard who decides that you're not flying the first time in Draenor. They are the ones who wants you to experience the world as it should be. You know, actually experiencing the zones instead of swooping down to quest items without a care in the world, ignoring any danger along the way.<br />
<br />
The &quot;just use ground mounts&quot; argument is as laughable as telling people who think leveling is too fast not to use heirlooms, well not using them feels like garbage because you lose 50% xp (ironically) and they have far worse gear in the process. Almost no one are willing to gimp themselves even though they would prefer the alternative.<br />
<br />
So why would anyone force themselves to take extra risks (daze, pvp, falldamage), travel about half as slow, when they can just jump on a flying anyway.<br />
And that's why flying is going away for now. Too much convenience is detrimental to the game.</div></div><hr />

Some of us don't mind about doing all the quest sequences of a zone, and they want to do that achievement, that would be a good reward for those who took the time to complete every story in Draenor.<br />
<br />
But I'm NOT OK with no flying at all ever, no ! When I connect just for an hour, I don't want to lose time going from one point to another.... Plus I have 180 mounts and a LOT of drakes and cloud serpents, which I can't use as ground mounts (even if they can walk, f*ck logic...), I took a lot of time to get these mounts, and I'm not OK about not being able to use them on Draenor !!!</div></div><hr />

Only when the things you're &quot;conveniencing&quot; your way over actually add gameplay or a means to an end.<br />
<br />
Yaungol that charge you aren't that. The ground and all the lovely mobs look just as pretty from the air if &quot;a richer world&quot; is what you're trying to build up here.<br />
<br />
And even that comparison is fallacious. Compare a zone like Storm peaks (absolutely cannot be traversed solely on the ground) to oh, say, Hellfire Peninsula (designed to be traversable on the ground)<br />

It's funny to watch the mental calisthetics people pull to try and shunt the &quot;blame of flying&quot; onto WotLK, because in their minds BC could do no wrong. It's usually some piddlin crap about &quot;well they weren't as bad back then!&quot; or some similar drek. <br />
<br />
A claim made even more laughable considering that nigh every single max-level faction in BC that required daily quests to earn rep REQUIRED flying mounts.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind being forced onto ground mounts for a certain period of time or in certain zones. I'm happy to be grounded during leveling/getting to know the world. But after a certain point it would get annoying, especially since flight paths are ALWAYS super inefficient ways to get from A to B, and don't let you stop in between. When you get to 100 and have been on Draenor for so long then not having flying will just make the game annoying to traverse the terrain from where you are to where you want to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Example: I've been working on fishing the quest fish for Nat Pagel rep. I almost always log out in the Shrine. I fly over the mountains north of the vale to kun-lai for the sha fish, then down to Vo4W for the flying fish, then on down to the Anglers place to fish up the octopus and be done. That's a straight line, up and down the continent that I can fly myself. Quick and efficient.<br />
With flight points I would have to take a flight path all the way around the vale from kunlai to get to Vo4W, then fly to a camp on northern border of Krasarang which takes me east and then west again to reach it, cuz that's the closest Horde flight point, then walk down through the jungle and across the water to get to the Anglers. Turning maybe 10min of flying/fishing into much longer period of time.</div></div><hr />

I'm torn between hoping they change the &quot;no flying&quot; decision before the expansion comes out versus them implementing &quot;no flying,&quot; receiving huge backlash, changing it to the way it should be and allowing flying at max level, and then never trying such a thing again. Maybe ever fewer daily quest zones with no flying to boot.</div></div><hr />

Actually I could give two shits about them removing hit and expertise. Really just pain in the ass stats. And also, no primary stat+expertise gems? That's just BS.<br />
<br />
But yes, removing flying isn't going to do much of anything. People are blaming a whole host of problems, some of which developed before flying (death of world PvP) and some of which developed long, long after on the existence of flying mounts. And of course, as they're not related, removing flying for no reason wont solve anything.</div></div><hr />

Losing time running from place to place and getting dazed off my mount to have to fight mobs that couldn't kill me if I AFKed for five minutes straight comes to mind.<br />

I might be inclined to fly over parts of Northrend just to look around every now and again. But I stay the hell away from doing so on the timeless isle. Any clues as to why? <br />

A few hints: jumping tigers, aggro-switching mobs, charging yaungol, difficulty of traversal, and all-around blandness. <br />

yeah same deal as I said before, go back seven years and tell em to change it. Because the game has been doing fine with it. <br />
<br />
<br />
I personally love playing on a vanilla server, no flying. Same with any other MMO. You actually get to interact with other players when your not just flying past them without ever seeing them.<br />
<br />
Yeah, again, I really don't give two shits if I see people while I'm traveling from A to B. <br />
<br />
The world becomes A to B the first time after you explore it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Most likely no flying in WoD. Ever. Thank God!<br />
<br />
Not a unanimously popular opinion. <br />
<br />
People bitching about flying &quot;ruining WoW&quot; is what goaded Blizzard to attempt this direction in the first place. All it takes to undo it is significant backlash in the opposite direction.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I pray to god all mighty of Narnia that they keep Draenor non-flying zone.<br />
As tedious as it was in Vanilla to gather mats and other things, it created so many things for the community.<br />
<br />
Yeah so did farming resist gear. <br />
<br />
No way in hell I'd want that back. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now its just braindead from point A to point B without any interaction with other players.<br />
This little change can bring so many refreshing changes to WoW's community whether you want to be part of it or not.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear people are crying wolf over this.<br />
<br />
That's not what &quot;cry wolf&quot; means... <br />
<br />
<br />
To be honest, I'm pretty amazed how people don't seem to see the opportunity this has.<br />
<br />
I've seen that &quot;opportunity&quot; with their attempts at it in 2.4, 4.2, 5.2, and 5.4. <br />
<br />
Yeah it's been underwhelming, frankly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Pretty sure its gonna be reverted after the first major patch hits in though.<br />
The WAAH WAAH in the forums will be massive and quite depressing to see.<br />
<br />
It's the wake-up call the &quot;flying ruined WoW&quot; crowd needs to get their heads out of the nostalgia sand.<br />
<br />
And it's fascinating how old that sand is. SEVEN YEARS we've had flying mounts. Flying mounts have been integral parts of what are widely regarded as the two &quot;best&quot; WoW expansions (BC and WotLK) and have been present though the game since to no ill-effect that wasn't already &quot;invoked&quot; all the way back in BC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was around when Azeroth was a no-flying zone, and guess what...PEOPLE DID THE SAME F-ING THING THEY ARE DOING NOW ON FLYERS!!! We see each other pass by, we go on our way to where we want to be. People didn't just stop and become bestest buddies because we were travelling slower and on the ground...<br />
<br />
When some poor bastard came and was pvp flagged, he'd get ganked unless he remained mounted and tried running for it. The ganker would follow and keep trying since gankers are like that. If someone lands today and is pvp flagged, the ganker simply waits for the player to dismount, and then goes about doing what he does. <br />
<br />
Them removing flying won't cure your nostalgia. The gaming community has changed, DEAL with it.</div></div><hr />

Most people with average intellect will map and learn a zone after going through it the first time. Open world PVP was dead before TBC released. You and others are still free to use ground mounts, those of us who get immense joy out of having them shouldn't be forced down to your way of playing.<br />
<br />
Simple as that. And if the gold argument doesn't work, how about the REAL money people have spent on flyers? Or, the real TIME spent on flyers?<br />
<br />
That isn't the main argument though. You might be fine with only seeing the zone from the ground, others are not. I have done more exploration using flyers than most people ever do when grounded.</div></div><hr />

I don't fly &quot;just to fly&quot; very often, I fly to get where I want to go. So it's pretty empty to say &quot;well you can still use them somewhere where you don't need them!&quot; And I didn't collect all of my mounts, flying or otherwise, just to watch them sit in my mount list.

Once again wrong. They have mentioned multiple times they are trying to transition into a more dynamic world in WoD from the static one we have now. Do you know what DIRECTLY combats this direction? Flying mounts. Are they being heavy handed? Yes. Is it justified? Yes. Is it the end of the world? No.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't do that in any way, shape or form, considering that people will either 1) choose to participate in dynamic events, in which case flying mounts wouldn't impede this in any way or 2) be randomly flung into dynamic events, which just gets helluva annoying. &quot;Charging bridge Yaungol&quot; is applicable here.<br />

So now we get to the &quot;it's bad to see the ground from the air, but it's good to see the ground from the air AND encourage people to AFK while traveling AND not just be able to avoid, but actually be completely unable to participate in dynamic events/world pvp/etc?&quot;<br />

Yeah, but still... You have flying mounts and for some reason you are using a windrider... it feels... 'Strange' to say at least. :P<br />
IMO, it would be better if they put other kind of vehicles in draenor, using land, water and air... Zeps, ships, trains (the iron horde theme even fits it XD)... I bet they already put something like this in game... (edit: I mean in Draenor! :P )<br />
<br />
I think windriders are boring, specially since we can do what the windriders can, better and faster than them (yeah, they are faster but our routes can be better, and we can stop at any point XD)... So, just hoping they did with draenor what they did with Azeroth: variety.</div></div><hr />

You had to quit playing at Wrath if you're that decided about it, remember cold weather flying? Was a pretty big thing back in the day. If we look back flying only worked out as a selling point for TBC. You were years in this world walking the ground, but now you could fly! Awesome! But now people like you are crying that flying (probably temporarily because of all the cry) disappears from the game, they only think about ''IWANT TOFLYBUT NOWFLYINGISGONEEEEE GIMME MY FLYING BACK I DON'T LIKE CHANGEEEEE''. And you aren't considering the positives like you feel like you're actually on an adventure, something where the game is all about remember? <br />
<br />
Instead of min-maxing everything and fly the shortest route to your herbs which you can spot with your addons and then log back out in 20 minutes before someone had even the chance to bump onto you ingame and you actually had some interaction with. Remember, where the game is all about? Interaction with other players, and that's what's going to happen with WoD. Everyone back on land again, huge amounts of players on the ground spread across the continent where everywhere is something to do. Instead of having an empty ground and look at the sky and see 10 people AFK on their flying mount. <br />
<br />
The more I talk about this the more I respect Blizzard for making this decision. And the more I think how stupid it is this large amount still don't get it, or don't want to get it. Or just don't like interacting with other players like it once was. Or just don't like change. Probably the last now I think about it.</div></div><hr />

Very little variety in Azeroth that isn't used to fair lowby horde across swaths of ground that are largely inconsequential. <br />
<br />
I don't regard the turtle boats in WotLK with much affection beyond the cool transport music, seeing as the only real need for their existence was because of the awkward croissant-conforming fatigue water that stretched the southern coast of Northrend.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that some players like me won't apear in your statistics &quot;how it play out&quot;.<br />

My acount is already frozen (after I saw the lazy and lackluster WoD &quot;un-expansion&quot; presentation at Blizzcon ) and I just won't buy your expansion (or future expansions) until you get back to full flying and eventualy fire Afrasiabi or the others stupids game designers who thought that was a good ideea.<br />

For you that mean some couple hundred lost dollars that will not apear on the statistic &quot;did they love the no flying ideea or not&quot;.<br />

And in a perfect world, give selected PVP / PVE realms a free transfer when the pre-expansion patch hits the fan.<br />

<br />
From PvE perspective it is understandable if people just want to do their own things as fast as possible. Non-flying zone hinders what PvE focused players (daily doers, gatherers..) are trying to achieve.<br />
From PvP perspective, flying mounts just hinder everything PvP realms are meant for. Which is what this &quot;nostalgia crowd&quot; is crying for.</div></div><hr />

You also could fly before max level. And you could get loaner mounts to level in storm peaks and Icecrown (which you actually needed) <br />

<br />
Never quite felt like I was on &quot;an adventure&quot; on the timeless isle of isle of the thunder king or molten front or any of that jazz any moreso than I did places I could fly. <br />
<br />
And who are you to say &quot;YOU'RE NOT FEELING RIGHT IN THIS GAME!&quot;<br />

<br />
Maybe I like doing that. <br />
<br />
The only &quot;interactions&quot; I've had with players as of lately on the &quot;no flying&quot; areas is waiting a few seconds so they aggro mobs instead of me we're both trying to run past, or destroying poorly geared players for bloody coins repeatedly.<br />
<br />
I haven't been goaded to &quot;become bestest buddies&quot; with the random people I see. <br />
<br />
<br />
Remember, where the game is all about? Interaction with other players, and that's what's going to happen with WoD.<br />
<br />
I get my interaction with other people in raids and dungeons and BGs. <br />
<br />
My interaction with people in the current &quot;no-flying&quot; areas, or when leveling up to max level, or even back on old Azeroth, don't match up to anything you're saying they supposedly did. I never relied or met up with people for anything that I wouldn't have required their help with anyway; i.e, challenging rare spawns or farming that ungodly number of yaungol for Shaohao rep which, frankly, wouldn't have been made any &quot;less enjoyable&quot; (as laughable as that thought is in regards to the latter) by flying mounts. <br />
<br />
<br />
Everyone back on land again, huge amounts of players on the ground spread across the continent where everywhere is something to do.<br />
<br />
&quot;Everywhere is something to do&quot; actually doesn't last very long for blizzard. I don't consider camping out and waiting on some rarespawn or constantly running between rarespawn points &quot;waiting for the 'something' to happen'&quot; to be adequate justification, seeing as I did that while on a flying mount while hunting for the Time-lost proto-drake AND Aeonaxx. <br />
<br />
<br />
Instead of having an empty ground and look at the sky and see 10 people AFK on their flying mount.<br />

Change that comes at the effect of removing the way people like to play by saying &quot;no you're not playing right, you should have fun this way&quot; is not &quot;good&quot; change. And as that happens to conflict with how I LIKE to play the game, you're damn right I'm not going to lay down for that. <br />
<br />
You might as well be complaining that they should remove LFD and LFR and make everyone just sit in trade chat to form groups because it was &quot;a more meaningful experience&quot; back when you had to do things like that.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah it's been pretty awesome for the majority of the game's existence. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Never quite felt like I was on &quot;an adventure&quot; on the timeless isle of isle of the thunder king or molten front or any of that jazz any moreso than I did places I could fly. <br />
<br />
And who are you to say &quot;YOU'RE NOT FEELING RIGHT IN THIS GAME!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I like doing that. <br />
<br />
The only &quot;interactions&quot; I've had with players as of lately on the &quot;no flying&quot; areas is waiting a few seconds so they aggro mobs instead of me we're both trying to run past, or destroying poorly geared players for bloody coins repeatedly.<br />
<br />
I haven't been goaded to &quot;become bestest buddies&quot; with the random people I see. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I get my interaction with other people in raids and dungeons and BGs. <br />
<br />
My interaction with people in the current &quot;no-flying&quot; areas, or when leveling up to max level, or even back on old Azeroth, don't match up to anything you're saying they supposedly did. I never relied or met up with people for anything that I wouldn't have required their help with anyway; i.e, challenging rare spawns or farming that ungodly number of yaungol for Shaohao rep which, frankly, wouldn't have been made any &quot;less enjoyable&quot; (as laughable as that thought is in regards to the latter) by flying mounts. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Everywhere is something to do&quot; actually doesn't last very long for blizzard. I don't consider camping out and waiting on some rarespawn or constantly running between rarespawn points &quot;waiting for the 'something' to happen'&quot; to be adequate justification, seeing as I did that while on a flying mount while hunting for the Time-lost proto-drake AND Aeonaxx. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If what people choose to do effects the way you enjoy the game, that's really a personal problem for you. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Change that comes at the effect of removing the way people like to play by saying &quot;no you're not playing right, you should have fun this way&quot; is not &quot;good&quot; change. And as that happens to conflict with how I LIKE to play the game, you're damn right I'm not going to lay down for that. <br />
<br />
You might as well be complaining that they should remove LFD and LFR and make everyone just sit in trade chat to form groups because it was &quot;a more meaningful experience&quot; back when you had to do things like that. Can't tell you a single person I ever manually formed a group with back in the day. Never made a note of them.<br />
<br />
Honestly, you sound like someone who's seriously lacking some very basic social skills. It really just sounds like you play a single-player RPG and treat everyone as NPC's whenever you &quot;need&quot; them. Guess what? In hopefully about half a year now, you'll be playing the game wrong, indeed. Know why? Because you cannot fly anymore, if you're still flying, you're playing the game wrong.<br />
<br />
I honestly hope they stay away from flying mounts forever. They can do so much more with this world if they keep everyone grounded. I've made some big posts about how/why I think keeping ground mounts is a good thing, I can't be arsed to do so in every single thread that pops up with this subject, though. The point is: if you cannot see the potential of a ground mount only in this game, you're really narrow minded.</div></div><hr />

You like their ideea ? Very good . How about to pay more on the expansion to compensate for the money I don't put there anymore. <br />
Oh wait , you will already do this , 50 euro expansion instead of 40 . We won't be missed , right ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ooh, getting touchy, are we? <br />
<br />
Your claim is doubtful, seeing as I mainly do things like raid or do battlegrounds, which, along with my class and my ability to play my class, probably aren't going to be unilaterally changed. There's no real content in the world. The timeless isle did little to change that, and I see very little Blizzard can do to add to it in any way that would be curtailed by flying mounts. Beyond my completionist streak and the desire to acquire more mounts/occasionally pets and doing activities pursuant to those ends, I really don't travel out into the world. (Am I going to run around aimlessly and kill random things &quot;for the life experience?&quot;) And when I'm doing mindless chores like killing bears for their asses for daily quests or collecting umpteen shiny rocks or waiting for rares to spawn, like on the timeless isle, I could really give a rat's ass if some people supposedly think such banal things are &quot;more fulfilling&quot; from the ground when all I can see is that they're more time-consuming. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
No potential that couldn't easily be done with flying mounts, for the two VERY simple reasons I described above. But I'll relist them for posterity. <br />
<br />
Either 1) Dynamic events are something that you choose to do. Which means that the existence of flying is irrelevant. If you're going to ignore it, you're going to ignore it. If you're going to do it, you're going to drop out of the sky and do it. I have seen nothing on the timeless isle, isle of thunder, isle of giants, or any of the other &quot;no-fly zones&quot; Blizzard has concocted that leads me to believe otherwise. All of the &quot;dynamic events&quot; in any of these situations are literally just fancy rarespawns and a few gimmicky timed events or jumping puzzles that could easily be achieved without &quot;flying mounts ruining them&quot; by putting those events within indoor areas or disallowing flying for the duration of said timed event or gimicky puzzle. To which I reiterate, the broader existence of flying doesn't impact these at all. <br />
<br />
or 2) Players are thrust into Dynamic events. This is the only thing in which flying mounts would matter, and, frankly, is just annoying. It encourages players to avoid areas they know these things happen in or take undue measures to avoid them. &quot;Charging Bridge yaungol&quot; comes to mind. And frankly, you shouldn't be designing a game around &quot;which obstacles people prefer to do the least.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
You can argue for things like &quot;world PvP&quot; but even that only affects a specific type of server and is greatly hindered by the ever-problematic notion of massive server imbalance and that no real rewards exist for world PvP, which is why it took a massive hit when battlegrounds were introduced back in Vanilla WoW. An argument hindered even further by the existence of a PvP zone in WoD which will probably be no-flying during battles.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that either a) enough people quit who give &quot;No flying is bullshit&quot; as reason, so they enable flying again. Or b) They don't give a fuck, because it saves them a lot of development time and thus don't care to lose a few hundred thousand subscribers. Yes, only a few hundred thousand, because people quitting over this most likely already wanted to quit, just needed a little extra push to do so.<br />

<br />
For the same reason they greatly cut back on daily quests, removed daily-quest attunements, made lesser charms piss-easy to acquire, and nerfed heroic dungeons into oblivion. I actually didn't care about any of these things in their more time-consuming manifestations, because I chose to do them, but other players obviously did. It should be apparent that all of Blizzard's attempts to make things less efficient, more time consuming, and gated as of lately have been swiftly reverted.<br />

It goes beyond that. Consider that they designed these zones without flying in mind. Come the time they actually give us flying back, the zones will TRULY be trivialized because they designed them to be compact to compensate.</div></div><hr />

I agree that Blizzard really isn't good in creating dynamic events, but do keep in mind that Timeless Isle is only for low-level geared people and achievement &quot;whores&quot; or reputation &quot;whores&quot;. Warlords of Draenor will be home for everyone, and thus charging that bridge isn't so dangerous anymore, because there's 40 people instead of 5.<br />

An argument hindered even further by the existence of a PvP zone in WoD which will probably be no-flying during battles.<br />
<br />
I honestly think at this point it's best to keep no-flying forever. But only on PvP realms, or maybe even specific PvP realms. Keep flying enabled on PvE realms after they leveled first. On PvP realms, it was very annoying that max levels were already able to fly in Pandaria, while you couldn't as a leveler. Sure, it's a PvP realm and I don't really mind getting corpse camped for an hour or two once in a while, but 77% resilience vs 40% resilience and no flying vs flying makes it literally impossible to kill the ganker and to get away as well. Now, they said they wanted to fix the immense power a higher level player has over a lower level player. But they also specifically stated that once a max level player is out to get you, you're screwed.<br />
<br />
So yeah, on a PvP realm, it would be very awesome to see the no-flying experiment to be successful and be permanent. It's also a very good way to meet friends, hell, I got several Alliance (I'm Horde) on my friends list because we had a nice fight in Hellfire Peninsula, I talk to them every day. Yet another reason why you shouldn't see people purely to get you from A to B, you won't make any friends.</div></div><hr />

It honestly doesnt bother me that they are removing flying. It helps make world PVP more fun, it brings back exploration, and it just overall helps with immersion, they spend a lot of time crafting every rock and blade of grass for this new world and I don't blame them one bit for wanting you to see it all. The flying mounts you paid gold to allow you to fly were paid for...to allow flight in THAT content. This is why every expansion had it's own price to allow flight.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't really matter either way, nor does it make those annoying mobs any less annoying. If I see some lone person getting thrashed by a mob that it takes some exorbitant number of people to kill, I'm not going to valiantly run in so I can get clobbered as well. Just like with the bridge Yaungol... I'm going to keep on running past. <br />

Not everyone has the same experience as you. I had no such experiences back on old Azeroth or through any leveling content. <br />
<br />
In fact, the most RECENT bout of &quot;friend making&quot; I had was hunting down the Zandalari warbringers back in 5.2. I could solo them. Two other guys I happened across while farming could also solo them. We banded together to monopolize the spawns. And you know what we were gallivanting around Pandaria on while farming these Zandalari Warbringers? Flying mounts. In fact, our little joint venture would likely have been all but impossible without flying mounts allowing for swift and easy traversal of Pandaria. You know that 400 foot chasm between the northwest coast of jade forest (close to the spawn of one warbringer) and the southeast coast of Kun'lai (the spawn point of another warbringer?) That takes about 35 seconds to fly across. It would probably take half an hour to get around on foot. You can say &quot;well that might have happened with ground mounts!&quot; but the important factor is is that it happened with flying mounts completely involved and integral to the experience. So apparently it's very much possible to &quot;make buddies&quot; with flying mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slower leveling - you can't fly while leveling through the new area in any expansion<br />
<br />
Slower gathering - you can assign your garrison to do your gathering for you - &quot;But i want to use my garrison followers for other purposes&quot; - that is your choice then, but the gathering is still as fast.<br />
<br />
Slower traveling - flight paths mean anything to you? and there's also the bonus of 150% ground mounts<br />
<br />
Worse immersion - are you serious?<br />
<br />
Ground mount traveling is boring - yeah, flying in the clouds for 5 minutes not being able to afk is so much more fun.<br />
<br />
I don't like world PvP - Then why on earth are you on a pvp realm?<br />
<br />
Losing the ability to fly on all my kewl mounts that i have gathered - This is a valid argument<br />
<br />
I lose the ability to explore the zones - If this actually happens, that is just blizzard doing some bad quality zone designing, even in TBC you could reach every single objective you were suposed to get to without a flying mount (unless the objective specifically required a flying mount)<br />
<br />
I lose all my money spent into acquiring the flying skills - First of all, you still need those skills to fly outside of Draenor and second do you honestly believe that 10000 gold is a large amount over the course of 7 years?<br />
<br />
From the top of my head i could only come up with 1 solid argument against removing and that is the fact that you can't use all the mounts you have collected to harness their full potential, but this only applies to the new zones and in the old content you are still free to fly wherever you like. I know that people have more, but i want to see some solid arguments instead of &quot;My opinion is the most powerful one in the hole world&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mind calling people on their BS, it just sounded... whatever, let's just drop that part.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OQ works wonders. <br />
<br />
OQueue is a very good addon indeed, but I think most of its potential is for Flex, and a bit for normal. Although I do look for high-level PvPers in OQueue as well, as there are indeed some gems out there. So yeah, you're right.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Taking unilateral risks to fix things that aren't broken and wont fix things that ARE broken is not the way to go. <br />
<br />
I think they gave us the reason that it takes a lot less development time and that they don't want players to fly from A to B when questing. You could say that giving flying at max level should be enough for this, I'm just going to leave a post of me from somewhere else here:<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, if they implement it right, I don't see a problem with them testing out no-flying for a while. Not having flying didn't feel like a drag at all in Mists of Pandaria while leveling. That's while its flight paths are complete horse shit. If they finally stopped forcing scenic flight routes down our throat (or at least make them optional), travel time wouldn't be that much longer, it would also throw some gold out of the economy. If they also make ore/herb nodes spawn closer to eachother, like in Vanilla zones (where you often see 5+ nodes on a single minimap), it wouldn't make gathering a drag either, because everything would be more concentrated. Adding a flight path to every single town (like in MoP) and to raid instances would also help. <br />
<br />
They would also have to make the running animation of a lot of flying mounts a whole lot better, though. <br />
<br />
Long story short: Blizzard could pull it off, removing flight from the game, but it would require quite a bit of work. It seems they really want to do it, though, and if they do it right, it could be really awesome.<br />
<br />
Basically, if they do it right, I don't think people would hate it as much as they hate it currently.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That doesn't really matter either way, nor does it make those annoying mobs any less annoying. If I see some lone person getting thrashed by a mob that it takes some exorbitant number of people to kill, I'm not going to valiantly run in so I can get clobbered as well. Just like with the bridge Yaungol... I'm going to keep on running past. <br />
<br />
Nor does that address my specific points.<br />
<br />
That's something they can address, yes those Yaungol chargers are annoying and way too lethal for people, especially since it's mostly meant for people to gear up there. But again, that's easily addressed. Blizzard cannot fix the community when they leave people to die, they should however change questing accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ganking is ganking. <br />
<br />
Oh I know, which is why I specifically said that I don't mind getting corpse camped. But in TBC, if you were a lot better (like, 2.4k arena rating vs 2k rating), you'd win as a level 65 against a level 70. I guess they're addressing it with the item squish + the base resilience/battle fatigue mostly going away. That fixes the combat part, but that still wouldn't fix the flying vs ground part that so many people seem to love. Everyone should be able to fly, or no one should. At least then you have equal chances to get away, well apart from Rogues/Druids/Mages, those will always get away, if they want to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not everyone has the same experience as you. I had no such experiences back on old Azeroth or through any leveling content. <br />
<br />
I know that, but nor does everyone have the same experience as you, so that's not really a good argument. Whether or not more people would love to keep flying is currently debatable, and which way Blizzard cares the most about, only time will tell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In fact, the most RECENT bout of &quot;friend making&quot; I had was hunting down the Zandalari warbringers back in 5.2. I could solo them. Two other guys I happened across while farming could also solo them. We banded together to monopolize the spawns. And you know what we were gallivanting around Pandaria on while farming these Zandalari Warbringers? Flying mounts. In fact, our little joint venture would likely have been all but impossible without flying mounts allowing for swift and easy traversal of Pandaria. You know that 400 foot chasm between the northwest coast of jade forest (close to the spawn of one warbringer) and the southeast coast of Kun'lai (the spawn point of another warbringer?) That takes about 35 seconds to fly across. It would probably take half an hour to get around on foot. You can say &quot;well that might have happened with ground mounts!&quot; but the important factor is is that it happened with flying mounts completely involved and integral to the experience. So apparently it's very much possible to &quot;make buddies&quot; with flying mounts.<br />
<br />
Guess what? You, and a lot of people who also think like you, are not looking at the big picture. That 400 foot chasm between those two areas? It wouldn't have existed if flying mounts weren't there. A) it would've been either smaller, or entirely different and b) a flight path can do pretty much the same, especially if you have a deal with eachother that person A gets area A to camp, person B gets area B to camp and person C gets area C to camp. Even in Mists of Pandaria, the flight path between Jade Forest and Kun-lai Summit takes a few minutes, at max.<br />
<br />
A lot of people seem to forget that Flight Paths are a lot faster than the fastest flying mount, but Blizzard forces the flight paths around scenic routes. These scenic routes should be optional (especially if they become mandatory). They shouldn't outright remove scenic routes either, because that'll be the only way you can see things from the sky in Draenor.</div></div><hr />

So we wont be able to skip quest hubs so does this mean that each zone will feel more like its &quot;on rails&quot;? A to B to C. Doesn't that go against what an MMO is?<br />
The devs want us to appreciate every blade of grass they have made. Sure i will do... but after 6 weeks i wont care anymore...</div></div><hr />

<br />
What? If anything, every quest zone is as linear as it can be. Since Cataclysm's revamp of the old areas, everything has became very linear, or &quot;on rails&quot;. Want to help out that Warchief in Stonetalon Mountains? Nope, have to help out that cave dweller at the start of the area first. Want to help the Dwarves in Twilight Highlands? Nope, have to phase them in first with the arrival quests.<br />
<br />
Phasing is one of the best things in this game, but it does make questing very linear and after the first time, very boring. Pandaria is exactly the same, sadly. If anything, Warlords of Draenor will put a stop to this, because you have random events/quests in the middle of nowhere popping up on your screen.<br />
<br />
You could argue that flying is a lot of fun, and a lot of people do, I get that. But the things you just posted aren't there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Truth is, I've decided to just not buy the expansion at all till flying is added back as a max level skill.<br />
<br />
blizzard can go without my money from the increased box price and normal sub fee.<br />
<br />
I've played when we had no flying, it's not as fun. I enjoy the game less.<br />
<br />
So, it's a move from blizzard I will not support.<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll have to see how we all feel about it in Warlords. I'm not saying Unsub(Cause that's a bit harsh to do). Giving constructive feedback will. Usually I would say getting rid of flying is silly but I don't know how Warlords of Draenor will be in terms of gameplay so it might be different. This is my personal feelings on this. Once I do, part of me hopes I change my mind, the other is concerned.<br />
<br />
Why would you give blizzard any money when they do something this drastic. Removing a great addition to the game that has been there for nearly 7 years just so some game company can experiment with the paying subscribers?<br />
<br />
Screw that.<br />
<br />
here is some constructive feed back: Design the game around flying and not removing it. Lets gamers decide if they want to be grounded or not.</div></div><hr />

I respect them for it. This is the first expansion since years that they do something drastic, which is awesome. They were too afraid to do new things, because they were scared of losing too many subscribers. Now that they've seen that staying the same old stale game doesn't work either, they're finally realizing they have to do something drastic to keep people interested. Whether or not this is the right thing to do to get more subscribers is something we cannot tell until 6.1.</div></div><hr />

You can get into every dungeon/BG without it, and (at least in MOP) there are plenty of Flight Points around that you'd never need fly anyway.<br />
<br />
When I log into MOP, my hearth is set to the Shrine and I can get there every 15 minutes, I can teleport to Timeless Isle (no flying there anyway), I can take a flight point to the PvP vendors and Isle of Thunder (for the 700 free honor in 15 minutes, and there's no flying there either). The only time I've actually needed to fly (outside collecting Ore, which I could do on a ground mount in Jade Forest with zero problems) was flying from the Shine to the start of SoO for the TI quests that make you see the visions, which is all of what, 300 meters, and if I wanted to I could get their though the UI anyway.<br />
<br />
Really, other than griefing lowbies by dropping in on them while they level, flying is not all that important at 90 in Panda Land.</div></div><hr />

<br />
^ This, 1000x this ^ You cannot continue to milk your player base for flying mounts in the Blizz store, all the while, planning to remove it upon launch. To the people who are going to say &quot;you can still use them as ground mounts&quot;... That's like taking a 747 out for a drive on the highway.... The flying mounts are bulky and clunky while running around on the ground, and if they can't fly they might as well all be penguins. That or make a melee hunter spec again so I can understand who cast &quot;wing clip&quot; on all the mounts.<br />
<br />
<br />
hate flying mounts, world will definitely be more dynamic/engaging by getting rid of them. example: everyone rushes to rare spawn, rapes it, everyone mounts up and flies away immediately ,leaving the ground empty and deserted<br />
<br />
World will be more dynamic using that example?!? Lol.. Timeless isle has shown that it's not more dynamic... Everyone rushes to rare spawn area, camps area forever, nukes mob mounts up and rides away immediately, leaving the ground empty and deserted.... If there was flying on timeless isle there would be less lag points where people sit and camp mobs on respawn since people could effectively get to the mobs before they die.</div></div><hr />

If not then, they will when the sub numbers dropped just like they went back on all the healing changes in Cata. As it is, I will probably level to 100 to see the content and then unsub, especially if it's another daily crawl for the first few patches. I cannot imagine having to do the massive amounts of dailies that were force-fed to us in 5.0 without a flying mount. IoT dailies were ground only but very short and linear.</div></div><hr />

I get that they don't want you to make leveling easier by allowing flying right off the bat, but for alts it should be allowed. (Like the tome of cold weather flying: level 80 to buy, but level 68 to learn on your alts). And now they are considering to disallow flying altogether? This is nuts.<br />
I cancelled my subscription 4 months ago but was planning to come back in WoD... but the more dev interviews I read, the more I'm like &quot;Eh, screw this.&quot; Bring back cata healing, less mobility for casters, no flying.... it seems Blizzard is going back in time instead of forward. Guess they just don't want my money.<br />
Next addon will probably be like &quot;We've decided that graphics don't leave enough room for your imagination, so we're excited to announce that WoW will be turned into an 80's style text adventure.&quot;<br />

<br />
The world is FAR more than just the shitty trees you can look up at from the floor. It's not some 2.5D landscape where only the floor is actually there. I experience plenty more when I can fly. I'm encouraged to explore more. I'm more immersed. In a fantasy world that has so many creatures that can fly (and be ridden), I would find it monumentally stupid that my character wouldn't have found a way to fly too. And for the love of Elune, please don't tell me I can use flight paths and explore or be immersed that way. I fail to see how I can be immersed while on an AFK bird flight.<br />
<br />
As for quest stuff, the only time you've been able to fly during an entire leveling process was Cataclysm. Every other expansion has grounded you until max level, when you're done with questing. Other than WoTLK, of course, where you could fly at 77(iirc). You're not just mounting up, flying to the next mob, killing, flying up again.... You literally can't because you can't fly yet! How does it ruin questing when it's non-existent?<br />
<br />
Oh, there is also those telling others that they can still fly in old content. How is that a damn compromise? You won't be able to fly in the content that you actually want to do but you can fly in content that has been redundant for years! Woop! &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
Also, I've done the &quot;world without flying&quot; before for 2 years of Vanilla and the start of TBC. So please don't tell me I'd love a non-flying world if I actually got to experience one. Been there, done that, got the damn t-shirt xD</div></div><hr />

lol Not at all. If you look, even when an MMO doesn't have flying, they have means of instant travel that would make even flying pointless and/or tedious. Look at GW2, you can port around the maps in seconds. They literally cut flying out and made it even more convenient to travel around.<br />
<br />
New MMOs don't have flying because a lot of them don't actually need it when they have other methods in place that are even more convenient.</div></div><hr />

Nope. They have to have fast travel because players are spoiled, and gw was always a lobby game anyway, but that is besides the point. The point being, that flying is the worst possible feature if you want any kind of living world.</div></div><hr />

Yup, just started taking up other MMOs. Finding I'm not really missing flying in them because of the insta-port to set places on the map. <br />
<br />
WoW is trying to correct what they did when they put the flying mounts in, but it's too late for that. Blizzard selling these mounts in their stores makes it near impossible to justify not allowing the &quot;flying&quot; mounts they sell to fly without issuing refunds. Pretty sure they have a term for when something doesn't do what you say it does... fraud.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with players being spoilt at all. One of the big things about GW2 is the world and how much they encourage you to explore it. They even have a &quot;map completion&quot; percentage and achievement for it.<br />
<br />
GW1 is an entirely different game to GW2. GW2 is very far removed from the lobby game that the first title was.<br />
<br />
Flying is/was a great feature to have added to the game. The only issue I see is that Blizzard made flying much more attractive to do than using ground mounts. And also that they can't seem to design the world to be great for both forms of transport. Flying doesn't remove anything from the game, imo. Unless you're on a PvP server, maybe. In which case just get rid of flying on all PvP servers.</div></div><hr />

If you want to have &quot;world&quot; (not everyone wants it), then fast travel just for the sake of it, is detrimental and usually implemented because players are a bit spoiled (from multiple things, like how many choises they have for games these days). It can be done correctly and within the game spirit, like say those portals in anarchy online, or teleports and summons in wow. It can also be used to cut costs, of course. But again, it's besides the point.<br />
<br />
And the point being, that there is a reason why nobody is implementing flying after seeing what it did to wow, while everyone is stealing the actually good features. And now blizzard wants to get rid of it too. It doesn't seem to qualify as a &quot;great feature&quot; that somebody would actually want in their game, quite the opposite.</div></div><hr />

BUT, it will all equal out in the end. If no one is allowed to fly, then the amount of herbs, ratio wise, will be the same on the AH as it is today; You'll still make the same amount of money, it will just require a little more conscious thought (due to mobs possibly being around and whatnot) instead of just mindless flying from one node to the next. <br />

Perhaps, they will provide some sort of ground speed boost on Draenor ? Be pretty interesting to cruise around at 150 % speed or so but it may look a little awkward with everyone's mounts looking like they are on a significant dosage of stimulants.</div></div><hr />

Totally comparable, WoW is real life.<br />
<br />
In the end this discussion is pointless. Flying is gone for one major patch in order to make people experience Draenor as intended, not skipping every obstacle and potential danger and then complaining about boredom and lack of excitement. Kinda reminds me of CRZ, oh how horrible it is in every way imaginable! By the way it's dull that all zones are empty.<br />
Oh wait...<br />

You can tell stories with flying. They're just not willing to innovate. Pandaria has you taking taxis from NPCs in order to speed along the traveling process, so the idea of of mounts not being needed to keep up with the pacing of the story is silly. They give them to you during the quests!</div></div><hr />

Easy, players will hit lev cap and then the world will be dead. At this point in WoW most people would rather buy any matts they need off the AH then go out on a ground mount to fight over nodes. Besides, nothing that comes from professions has managed to shine threw as worth the bother and if you do get a item it often goes to a alt because you just can't really make anything on it in the AH.<br />
<br />
Right now I log in to raid. That's it! I don't see WoD if I even buy it making me want to do more. Blizzard needs to stop using us in experiments with a decade old game. I really think it is going to come back to bite them. Even now I think the sales on WoD will be at a record low on release. Right now I still have no plan to buy it. MoP might be the end of the road for me. See what happens.</div></div><hr />

I am willing to try it out for a shorter while in warlords. But for me, flying has been one of the best additions to the game, and i'd hate it if it was removed.<br />

For one, at max-level no-flying would would suck. Farming herbs or mineral would take years and the prices for raw materials would skyrocket. Also, going back to older quest zones to pick up something you missed would be more of a chore than I think it would be worth. However, having a more dangerous world, world pvp, and immersion sounds intriguing.<br />
<br />
My solution:<br />
<br />
1. Enable flying mounts that 1. run slower than ground mounts but can double-triple jump, or have some 10 sec of fly capacity with a 10 sec CD. Implement this in all leveling zones.<br />
2. Disable flying mounts in zones dedicated to lvl 100 content. Ground mounts only.<br />
3. After max level, enable flying in the leveling zones.<br />

<br />
How does no flying &quot;change things up&quot;? They do that at the beginning of most of the expacs since flying was introduced. The only difference here is they haven't exactly decided on how long it will last. I think it'd be a terrible idea to have no flying at all in Draenor, especially if they leave it in for the other places of the game. <br />
<br />
To anyone who thinks that will make players appreciate the content more...you're delusional. Nothing like forcing people to play against how they'd like to play to make them appreciate the game more, am i right?<br />
<br />
To those of you saying &quot;It's Blizzards game, let them make it how they like it!&quot; - Well, they aren't paying to play it now, are they? You don't develop a product based on what the dev's like, you base it off what the customers are going to like. This goes for those that say &quot;IF you don't like it, you don't have to play&quot; - well that's true as well, but seems like a fucking terrible business model - &quot;Let's change things that we know a good portion of the player base really enjoys and hint that if they don't like it, they can cancel their subscriptions! We don't want their money anyway, right?&quot;<br />
<br />
To those of you saying &quot;all the Blizzard store mounts double as ground mounts anyway, so it's no big deal&quot; - While true, you are cutting half of the use of the purchased mount out, should half of the cost of the mount be refunded then because they'd only be using half of the mount? What about all the other in-game obtained mounts that aren't flying/ground mounts? We're supposed to just forget they exist or just go hang out in the old Azeroth areas just so we can fly? So much for promoting that brand new content past 100 then, huh?<br />
<br />
Yes, we all need to wait till more info is available, but the information we have is shining a terrible light on a possible direction that Blizzard is considering for the game that we pay for. Not to mention just how stupid it is to make the CE/Digital Deluxe mount a FLYING and ground mount if they are considering/intent on possibly removing flying in the newest area of the game.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I'm with you on blizz not thinking for us. We shouldn't be given flight at all, as there is effectively no choice, nor thinking involved. Flying beats all other options by far. We should not be forced into such a situation if we want to enjoy the game the way it is designed to be played. People ALWAYS go for the fastest option, and there is quite a societal pressure to do the same (guilds and such wanting people to rush through content to begin raiding as an example). Some people are just so utterly spoiled by the convenience of flight that they will have it no other way, and that is kind of sad. They won't even give it a chance, just dig their heels in and start slamming things with their fists (text on forums).</div></div><hr />

Then go through the cave over to the veiled stair and then down the mountain and through all the critters in the valley? That's what you do right? Cause you guys hate flying. You hate it so much that you're not content with just you doing that long trek, you want EVERYONE to be FORCED to do it with you.<br />

You do realize you will still be able to fly in Pandaria right...just not in Draenor...it's sounding like you don't know what your talking about.<br />

Look at this chucklefuck. He thinks he knows me, or anyone else on this forum.<br />
<br />
No, no i wont like not being able to fly. A feature i have earned several times now, and spent gold AND real money on.<br />
You gonna refund all that gold and those shekels, blizzard? Are you?<br />
<br />
And holy fuck, there are actually delusional people in this thread that believe no flying will have ANY consequence on world pvp.<br />
Sorry skidmark, but it wont. WPVP is dead, perhaps its time you stopped skullfucking its dessicated corpse. it died with the arrival of instanced pvp.<br />
Get over it. i know it sucks that you cant beat anyone anymore because you had an unfair advantage.<br />

To those of you screaming your little heads off about how &quot;muhhh flying mounts I worked for&quot; - Guess what; We get to use our ground mounts again outside of BG's and Timeless Isle.<br />
Your refuted attempts of an argument towards &quot;you can sue them anyways&quot; is beyond retarded and proof that flying has indeed spoiled the playerbase into making things too easy.<br />

Just like they haven't specifically stated how long the flight restriction will be in place, they also haven't specifically said that flying in the older content would remain.<br />
<br />
Also, i'm not sure how it is for you, but the last time i was on a flying mount, i was still able to see the world around me and it didn't detract from seeing the beauty of the world below me. In fact, it gave me a different perspective than on the ground seeing everything. Why do you think the Space Needle in Seattle is so popular? I mean, the people of Seattle (and tourists) can easily just see things from the ground, right? Oh, that's right, people like to have a different vantage point from time to time. Besides, as has been said MANY many times, even if flying is in the game, nothing is forcing you onto a flying mount if you would prefer a ground mount to travel. <br />
<br />
Flying should be handled as it has been in the past: locked until level cap is reached.</div></div><hr />

It's more than just a minor restriction, a lot of those flying mount collections cost a lot of time, grinding, rep, gold, RNG, and in the case of WOD real recent money. They would basically be throwing that away (watching a dragon waddle along a road looks stupid). Also, it's not an issue of maturity, they want to see how it goes.

Hopefully the kids that play this game can learn to appreciate how it was originally built and how much it has strayed from its winning formula. For many reasons I hope lots of juvenile players unsubscribe with this change- then we can possibly re-enter the glory days of WoW being a challenging, thoughtful game devoid of the gimmicks and instant gratification that pander to the younger (age 16-21) player-base.<br />
<br />
WoW has, what 7-10 million active subscriptions now? How many when Vanilla was out? Probably not nearly as many....guess that really proves that ONLY Vanilla was a &quot;winning formula&quot;, unless you expect me to believe that all 7-10 million players started playing in Vanilla, but even that would prove that all the things they've done to this point have been part of a &quot;winning formula&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, i'm not really sure what makes you think that this will rid WoW of immature &quot;kids&quot; and make quality of life/community any better. There will always be annoying, immature, &quot;kids&quot; (you do know that there are a lot of immature adults playing this game?) playing every video game out there.</div></div><hr />

Well, there's the fact that it isn't going away permanently. So, yeah, pretty small bump there. I'd like to see some decent arguments about WHY flying is important. Something a decent bit more substantial than the argument of convenience.<br />
<br />
For those that like the sight of them, and enjoy using them. That's a fine argument, but it's along the lines of the counter argument that people spend quite a bit of time trying for some ground mounts, yet don't ever use them because flying outstrips their use in nearly every way (barring the occasional dungeon or bg that allows their use). Even if you enjoy the sight of them, they'll be useable again with the first patch being released (you could argue that those store mounts ARE useable on the ground AND all of the older content, so it's not like the money is going to waste).<br />
<br />

Well, there's the key point. They want to see the reaction, which usually comes after people actually giving it a shot (not being so childish as to unsub, purely out of spite, and their opinions aren't all that useful, if they're really willing to quit over something so simple, then they probably aren't the long term player that blizzard would worry over). The most likely outcome is that they follow what was originally planned, and allow flying in the older content with the release of the first patch.

Difference being that this is a game. Games are meant to be played, and content to be used. Problem is, is that like a car, you aren't driving to drive (95% of the time), you drive to get to your destination. But in a game, the destination is meant to be reached through playing.<br />

Your analogy seems to be a narrow view. Although it isn't &quot;logical&quot; to remove flying once someone has acquired it. I can still understand that from a design concept, it just makes the game easier to create if you can limit the player base from doing what they would prefer to do. Currently, we fly all over the place. I do not miss vanilla at all in that view. It took forever to get places. I prefer to fly directly to where I prefer to go, regardless if it is &quot;just sight seeing&quot;, or to a daily quest hub, or material gathering.<br />
<br />
If flying is ever removed entirely. I will have no desire to pay a monthly fee.<br />

I don't think many argues that removing flying for a while will &quot;bring back&quot; anything, other than putting a healthy limit on convenience for a while.<br />

<br />
Usually when Blizzard floats an idea half a year before it happens, the reaction comes right away, which is probably the reason why they brought the issue up now. Hence they have some interest in seeing our current reactions as well and we have some interest in sharing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again, this is the WORST argument of them all. To think that Blizzard would be okay with any amount of cancelled subscriptions from something they change is kinda dumb. Yes, i can concede that they probably have a number that would be considered an &quot;acceptable&quot; loss, but even with that no company is going to be willing to do something that they know would cost them money. Removing flight (even just in one portion of the game) would cause less people to be inclined to buy new store mounts, even if they reduced the cost of those mounts if they only had a ground option, and to think that people would be willing to pay the same amount for a mount they only get half use out of for the majority of the content they will be participating in with a tagline of &quot;Don't worry, you can use the flying aspect of this new fancy mount when you visit the old content!!&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, if you think cancelling a subscription is &quot;childish&quot; you're ignoring the very real fact that actions speak louder than words and by cancelling they show their opinion very strongly to Blizzard about flying being removed. Blizzard doesn't care about the maturity level of the player base so long as said players are paying their sub fees. That's clearly evident by the conversations in Trade Chat on nearly every server.<br />

<br />
Person was referring to the one and only flight path that actually goes to Timeless Isle. Yes, many will connect to it, but it's in the middle of Jade Forest and it's a long flight from there to Timeless Isle. I think we've all been on many flight paths that don't go directly to our destination as if we were carrying multiple passengers and there were layovers along the way, many of those &quot;stops&quot; are out of the way and cause you to circle around your destination just to get there.</div></div><hr />

My &quot;narrow analogy&quot; was based off the quoted &quot;narrow view&quot; of describing it as if it were a car. If they feel like playing WoW is a job, and that they'd rather skip everything and just get it over with, then maybe they ought to take a break, or find some other game to play. As they are clearly not having fun with it anymore.<br />
<br />
Do you not play any single player games, because they &quot;force&quot; you to run through the story as dictated by their maker? Like in zelda, they allow you to ride eponia through that main world map in OoT, but they don't allow you to use it in the areas that actually matter. Would you be the type to get pissed off by that sentiment and not buy the game?<br />

I still don't see the reason people would get their pants in a bunch enough to unsubscribe purely because they try to make ground travel more viable and restrict flight. It seems like something else is behind it, and the flight restriction is an excuse.</div></div><hr />

anyone mention <br />
Upon arrival to Draenor, players will go through a 45 minute experience to try and turn off the Dark Portal to save Azeroth.<br />
Yet?<br />
<br />
Could this be something like AQ or is it individual?</div></div><hr />

Hence they have some interest in seeing our current reactions as well and we have some interest in sharing it.<br />
<br />
Yes, of course there is an immediate reaction. But, as it appears in many of the threads on the subject, these immediate reactions are baseless and have absolutely zero context on the content that will be provided or the changes they have made for the expansion. Unless we have a detailed blog post, videos of max level content or a beta test being utilized, we won't know how it is going to play out.<br />
<br />
Yet, we already have people threatening to unsub, whining about the loss of flight and all of this based on what is experienced in game NOW, not what will be in WoD. Which is why, the complaining should have a strong and well written reason for the dislike, or else wait for the beta to see how it plays out.</div></div><hr />
