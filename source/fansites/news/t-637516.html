well ret after doing their pve build have like 14 free point. so i was thinking that ret should take some prot talent just so tankadin dont have to take them.<br />
<br />
first they need to switch around Divine Sacrifice and Divine guardian. so ret take divine guardian that absorb dmg when they bubble and tank take the other one that absorb dmg when they dont bubble. and also if ret can take imp dev aura. prot can take other talent like imp stun or stuff like that.</div></div><hr />

14pts free is very nice. but there is only 10 worth taking in prot tree and non in holy. okay. now that auras are 40y aura mastery becomes obsolete. <br />

Owlkin Frenzy now affects all attacks. (Old - Physical melee and ranged attacks only)<br />
Celestial Focus now reduces the pushback suffered from damaging attacks while casting Starfire, Hibernate and Cyclone by 23/46/70% and increases your total spell haste by 1/2/3%.<br />
Nature's Grace now increasing your spell casting speed by 20% for 3 sec. (Old - Reduced the casting time of your next spell by 0.5 sec.)<br />
Feral<br />
Faerie Fire and Faerie Fire (Feral) now reduces the armor of the target for 5 min. (Up from 40 sec)<br />

@ Eclipse - decent change, more DPS when lag induces an improperly timed starfire crit ;)<br />
@ CE - YES! Starfire pushback reduction!!!<br />
@ NG - 20% haste for 3 seconds? Thats 2 starfire casts, 3 during BL! This could be a huge buff at high gear levels considering NG didn't scale with more haste you recieved.<br />

<br />
and the mage changes: is that there idea to make fire viable in pvp lol, a 5% chance to disarm target, i`m sorry but a fire mage will be dead before that procs. RNG is NOT the way to do this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
* Frostbrand Weapon damage has been increased. (From 442 to 530 damage for Rank 9, from 386 to 463 for Rank 8, etc ...)<br />
* Frozen Power now Increases the damage done by your Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Lava Lash and Shock spells by 5/10% on targets afflicted by your Frostbrand Attack effect<br />
* Flurry now Increases your attack speed by 5/10/15/20/25% for your next 3 swings after dealing a critical strike. (Down from 10/15/20/25/30%)<br />
<br />
<br />
Srs ... damn you blizz damn you .... it was promised to enhance that flurry never gets into line with warrior flurry -.-<br />

yes, could work well depending on proc rate.. <br />
still probably a TPS dent compared to 2H tanking but will wait and see.<br />
<br />
good to see our nurfs though.. the %crit damage talents were just way to spikey..<br />

<br />
DW DK got a bit buffed in ptr like BCB and necrosis talents but also some nerfs in +crit dmg etc. I really find frost now not viable. double cd on HB but double dng, but less +crit dmg on frost moves, which tbh wasnt needed outside HB<br />
<br />
and the mage changes: is that there idea to make fire viable in pvp lol, a 5% chance to disarm target, i`m sorry but a fire mage will be dead before that procs. RNG is NOT the way to do this.<br />
<br />
<br />
changing 45% crit damage bonus to 15% damage all around is not a nerf. Even your crit damage will increase, here's an example.<br />
<br />
Let's say your hb hits for 4000<br />
45% critical damage bonus<br />
4000 base noncrit<br />
4000x2.225=8900 crit (45% critical strike damage bonus is actually 22.5% total crit damage)<br />
15% overall damage bonus<br />
4000x1.15=4600 base noncrit<br />
4600x2=9200 crit<br />
<br />
higher crit and noncrit amounts</div></div><hr />

for real now dude. it's so easy to get to 19XX as ret, but after that you just only meet counter teams. being a holy on the other hand is healing as much and as long as you can without clicking the bubble-button. now the last defence falls when a very prominent pvp-class not only has an MS effect but at the same time can remove the only thing that makes a class survive in pvp.<br />
<br />
and for mages i don't think i need to explain that they are already butchered by any given class if they don't hit a burst kill until they can IB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's say your hb hits for 4000<br />
45% critical damage bonus<br />
4000 base noncrit<br />
4000x2.225=8900 crit (45% critical strike damage bonus is actually 22.5% total crit damage)<br />
15% overall damage bonus<br />
4000x1.15=4600 base noncrit<br />
4600x2=9200 crit<br />
<br />
higher crit and noncrit amounts<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to be a negative nancy, but I can't allow you to continue through life getting things wrong.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where you learned basic mathematics, but a 45% critical strike damage bonus means melee crits hit for 2.45x normal damage since the critical damage would be 100% + 45% = 145%.<br />
<br />
Therefore, your point is completely misleading. <br />
<br />
4000x2.225=8900 crit (45% critical strike damage bonus is actually 22.5% total crit damage)<br />
should read<br />
4000x2.45=9800 crit<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, really drooling over that new enchant. That's an absolutely insane enchant, and it's much more exciting than the titanguard. Let's hope it doesn't go the same path as Titanguard did.<br />
<br />
1000 parry rating.... hmm, at 80 that's.... err..... well, 100 parry is 2.03%, so 20.3% when fully stacked o_O<br />
Can't wait to try it out.<br />
<br />
<br />
Have any of you stopped for a second and thought about this in a realistic fashion? I think you're all too busy blowing your loads to realise that the proc buff is going to expire the moment you parry for the first time since it procced. Considering the tooltip clearly states the REAL meat and potatoes of this enchant... bonus threat when you parry!<br />
<br />
It will not last a flat 10 secs every proc, and you will not be able to maintain 20% of free parry by having a stack of procs up, at least, not for very long anyway.. soon as you parry, kiss it goodbye.<br />
<br />
I can't believe you guys would think something that OP would come from a simple weapon enchant. Don't be so ridiculous. O_o</div></div><hr />

It's your heals for 15 seconds as far as I can read and likely with a close to 30% uptime thats 5% &quot;increase&quot; in healing if the absorbs are all absorbed so to speak.<br />

No, you haven't been in EJ forums and you know nothing about new poison changes in 3.1 now do you ?<br />
poisons instead of %of proccing per hit they will have Procs Per Minute.<br />
<br />
This means our best Main Hand in 3.0 (Webbed with IP (for mutilate rogues)) will no longer be the best Main Hand compared to Sinister Revenge. This also means less energy from Focused Attacks.<br />
<br />
This glyph is just plain stupid since most likely without using Envenom you will be already consuming the PPM.<br />
Actually that glyph will probably be to laugh at rogues who have it, though it will depend on the PPM number...<br />

So you'd rather go back to the way it was in TBC where the first two tiers of raid content were either massively overtuned or outright unkillable and had to be essentially beta tested on live. Or better yet good old vanilla WoW with an impossible C'Thun and Ouro and BWL doors that don't open?<br />
<br />
Bosses will die quickly, they will always die quickly, this will happen no matter how blizzard tune the content as long as it's this side of impossible due to a raiding player base with 4 years of experience and endless free time on their hands. Sunwell would have been cleared in way less than 2 weeks were it not for the gate system.<br />

Chill out ace and consider the envenom change<br />
<br />
<br />
Envenom now gives an additional 15% chance to apply Deadly Poison and a 75% increased frequency of applying Instant Poison for 1 sec plus an additional 1 sec per combo point. (Previously gave a 15% chance to apply both deadly and instant poison)<br />
<br />
Now correct me if I'm wrong (without raging), but from what I'm seeing, envenom will increase the ppm of IP, and obviously DP has been left alone. While I agree that our dagger options might change, I don't really see what that has to do with the fact that taking out rupture from our cycle is probably going to be dps increase, also consider that:<br />
<br />
<br />
# Deadly Poison: The amount of damage this poison generates from the Rogue’s attack power has been increased from 8% per application to 12%.<br />
<br />
So basically, we get to free up 2 talent points, have 5 stacks of dp on the target, 2 glyph spots freed up for the hfb and mutilate glyphs, and spam the finisher that increases our IP ppm. The only problems I see happen is:<br />
A: Envenom spam &lt; having rupture in the cycle<br />
B: Hunger for blood not having the blood requirement fulfilled cause of the lack of rupture. Thats more of a problem with the new Hfb though.<br />
C: The Envemon spam doesn't help our ppm for some reason.<br />
<br />
If you think I'm wrong, then enlighten me a bit more.</div></div><hr />

Stop whining and be glad they are putting so much attention into making sure these bosses are tuned so self-entitled whiny malcontents like yourself can get your purples without having another SSC/TK 1.0 on your hands.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice assumption you make there, I like to work for my items. Surely an increased level of difficulty can be expected? Plowing through easy-tuned bosses doesn't make it more fun.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MikHaven</div><div class="date">2009-03-07, 04:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you'd rather go back to the way it was in TBC where the first two tiers of raid content were either massively overtuned or outright unkillable and had to be essentially beta tested on live. Or better yet good old vanilla WoW with an impossible C'Thun and Ouro and BWL doors that don't open?<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't disagree with the extent of your comments about the two possiblities of testing a boss, however I surmise there are more than the two ways your suggesting. Without the need for excessive QQ.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard was concerned about not letting people see the encounter until live they could, given a big enough test team. Test the Content themselves, we have seen several bugs and issues that should be caught in internal testing.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is they use the PTR as an internal test case, and this is not really the best idea for content on this level. I imagine their is quite a few people from the comments in the last few days to suggest Yogg should not be on the PTR. Or most of the bosses for that matter. Flame Leviathan would be nice, and a few others maybe.<br />
<br />
I don't know what the answer is, but honestly Not testing and putting it on live, and Testing it through the PTR is not the only way to do this. It woulnd't cost Blizzard THAT much money to hire 25 decent testers, heck prob even pay them $10 an hour. I know I would do it.<br />
<br />
I think maybe if I am catching you wrong, your main gist I'd probably agree with is the world firsts would happen no matter the test system, but the majority of testing can be behind closed doors for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
25 people isn't anywhere near enough to properly stress test the encounters. And I'm certain they will be putting their time and effort with regards to internal testing into Yogg-Saron and Algalon, because past history has proven that they don't like putting end bosses up on PTRs (for good or ill).<br />
The point also is that the top 50-100 guilds now are such a well oiled machine that they will easily devour almost any content thrown at them and balancing content to stretch them to the limit would simply be suicidal in the second raid out of four of this expansions progression chain.<br />
People throwing their toys out of the pram and screaming WORLD OF CASUALCRAFT GG BLIZZZZZ (ESPECIALLY on a PTR) with regards to this is short sighted and pointless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'd rather see them pumped into the live servers, broken and untuned, then testing them (if you really don't wanna know about the bosses, don't look ok?).<br />
<br />
You guys seem to QQ about every single thing Blizzard puts into this game, be it buffs, nerfs, new candy or TGC cards. Every fucking change is beeing laughed at, or called shit, because you think it's a nerf (or a buff to some class/area you don't like).<br />
<br />
Either stfu, accept the nerfs/buffs, or come with some constructive critisism. <br />
<br />
<br />
I have to agree. I mean you can't make all of the people happy all of the time and Blizz has their hands full even trying. Warriors can't really complain. I mean we have always kind of been the chosen children of the design team. The buffs to prot with the expansion are really great. Fury was always somewhat lacking and then we got TG with no penalty and we were all really happy for a while. Now you have to expect people to throw a little temper tantrum when they got it for a few short months and then they think they're having it taken away again. I really don't think it'll be that bad though.</div></div><hr />

Does anyone think the glyph of envenom will really be useful, <br />
<br />
that is to say will it be able to replace the glyph of rupture, because it definately wont be replacing the glyph of mutilate or the glyph of hunger for blood for pve dps, <br />

has anyone done the math?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You seem to have the impression that Blizzard doesn't have a QA dept testing things. They do actually. It's usaully a few builds ahead of what's on live or on the PTR. So bugs that may of come up on the PTR they might of already seen and logged.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know what the answer is, but honestly Not testing and putting it on live, and Testing it through the PTR is not the only way to do this. It woulnd't cost Blizzard THAT much money to hire 25 decent testers, heck prob even pay them $10 an hour. I know I would do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
They have their own internal testing team. Unfortunately there is 3 things it can't replicate no matter how hard they try. <br />
<br />
Firstly there isn't any way they can match the sheer amount of numbers possible on the PTR. They have 11 million players any one of which has the possiblity of being able to install the PTR and use it. Most times that I've on the PTR there has been around 336-400 players online at that one time. Anyone of these players can submit valuable feedback,observations and test data.<br />
<br />
Secondly not everyone uses the same hardware and software setups. That's another big advantage of the PTR - they get a testing lab that is effectively the size of most of their player base. Thats an insane amount of different video cards , drivers , operating system versions , CPUs etc etc etc. <br />
<br />
Lastly in a formal QA testing department they can only really do logical list of things based testing. That is they write out a list of tests with things like &quot;test hitting this mob x times&quot; or &quot;open this UI element x times&quot; , &quot;what happens if we do this&quot;. Stuff they predict the players will either do or break. What they can't predict is the more chaotic stuff. Ones where the players do stuff they didn't predict they would do. Or stuff they've never thought of testing..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The majority of testing can be behind closed doors for sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
It already is. They are usually a few builds ahead internally anyway. And let's not forget the internal testing on Diablo 3 , mystery MMO and Starcraft 2/3 going on right now :D</div></div><hr />

Also, I have a feeling that they're not quite as talented, when it comes to thinking outside the box, as the playerbase. On the other hand, I'm not entirely sure the playerbase can be counted on to report everything they see (ie. Sarth+Reflective Shield), though the GM-monitered bossfights sounds like a way to do it.</div></div><hr />

That nerf was for all priests specs not holy. If you read it's a 35 point talent meaning it's only going to be holy priests yet 2 other specs will not be able to remove it. Please read into this more before crying.<br />

Bye Bye last killable healer for a rogues in 2v2...good bye rogues in 2v2<br />

<br />
Can healers remove stuns, block interrupts, counter silences? You still have those arsenal in your rogue toolbox. Them dispelling 1 poison means you just have to play a different style as if it was a paladin/druid healer. Also most of the priests are disc so what are you worried about.</div></div><hr />

Players already know what blizzard puts up. Nothing new. Just more nerfs on top of the nerfs they nerfed a few days ago after having nerfed the previous nerfs due to the nerfs they implemented when first, they nerfed the nerfs they had previously nerfed due to the other nerfs they had added when first they thought of nerfing the nerfs which came to their minds before they ever thought of adding whatever it was they added to the classes.<br />
<br />
Just another nerf..er..another day in World of Nerf-craft.</div></div><hr />
