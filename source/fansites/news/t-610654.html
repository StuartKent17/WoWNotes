Speak to Weslex Quickwrench in Nesingwary Base Camp and do his questline if you didn't do it yet, at this point you probably already completed it while leveling. <br />
Once the Spirit of Gnomeregan is repaired, speak to Professor Calvert and accept the quest. <br />
Go to Lakeslide Landing near River's Heart (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/wotlk/maps/sholazarbasin.jpg) and talk to Pilot Vic here. <br />
The first quest he gives is a short quest to find his keys in the lake next to him. <br />
The 2nd quest will let you go in a reconnaissance flight with Pilot Vic. After defending your airplane against undead attackers you will eventually have to control it after one of the shot hits Pilot Vic. Go back to the Lakeslide Landing and ... <br />
Enjoy your flying mount ! (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/july/flyingmount9.jpg)<br />

Death Knight - More Changes<br />

The talent trees were updated last night with a lot of error fixes to the things that you wrote down as changes such as with Primal Tenacity, Improved Mangle, Faerie Fire range, Starfall mana cost, Maelstrom Weapon and many many many others for example. So either you should update you 'other class changes' to reflect the actual changes or not link to it as other changes as it is completely wrong and spreading misinformation.<br />
<br />
It's pretty safe to assume now that most changes that do not match the beta are changes that are going to happen in the next build.</div></div><hr />

It's actually pretty hard if you complete the quest but don't gain the Cold Weather Flying ability, yay for beta bugs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder if that &quot;spell&quot; will upgrade druid flight form, or if blizzard didn't think about druids up to now ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
Since druids can use flight form straight away in some parts of Northrend, that's without reaching level 77 or doing the quest, I'd say it's still &quot;work in progress&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fresh TBC was VERY hard. I remember having a hard time beating normal instances; heroics were just a bonus for hardcore games, ranging from hard to almost impossible... later I realized however that my guild's dds sucked.<br />
<br />
Still, I remember Nihilum crying out loud because of Vashj's mind control and that it took them endless tries to down her. Heroics (Karazhan was actually tuned quite well back then I think - hard but possible) were the same on a smaller scale. Nexus prince Shaffar? Yikes! Cot2? We died on the second boss while already 3-manning Cot1 with halfway-kara gear...<br />
<br />
However, suddenly items got buffed, druids got nerfed, flask mechanics got overworked, bosses retuned, heroics became a laugh (there are so many undocumented nerfs...). Blizzard decided that casual end game was no longer heroics and karazhan, but just a step ladder towards 25-raiding (so it seems to me). They trashed half the content... and they still do by adding more badge rewards.<br />
<br />
MgT gave me hope. It was hard, almost a bit unfair, but a small challenge. However, they nerfed it... I'm not in sunwell yet but it seems to be handled the same way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They seem to change the talents to accommodate this at the very least. Icy Touch no longer at a spammable cooldown indicates this at the very least. On the other side, Blood Strike changing a blood rune to a death rune would indicate otherwise as this would give more flexibility (i.e. skip all unholy runes altogether and use the converted blood runes to cast unholy spells).<br />
<br />
Who knows? (I love speculating)</div></div><hr />

Agreed, poor gnomes can't move around very well in Northrend I guess and therefore can't make much $$$? ::)<br />
<br />
I do have to say if this ends up going into the final build I will be pleasantly surprised. Granted 5k won't be too hard to farm with all the new quests and whatnot, but with all the money sinks blizzard has been putting in lately (like a certain &quot;heiress's&quot; goods in Shatt) it's kind nice to see they're not completely gold grubbing NPCs nowadays.</div></div><hr />

Is posting news about a celebrity's baby pathetic just because the baby isn't born yet? <br />

<br />
Pretty weak comparison. News about a celebrity's baby doesn't affect the public in the slightest. You got info on what the instances where and what they looked like what loot they dropped. That was the &quot;celebrity baby news&quot;. A strategy is completely different.<br />
<br />
WoW's foundation is based on strategy and by laying it out destroys the experience for all for the sake of news even though it’s not news at all. It’s like exploiting the future of the celebrity baby to the world which is unethical and impossible.</div></div><hr />

And Beta releases isn't the only place this happens, the test server has had the exact same thing done to it. Raiding guilds will go on there and try new raid instances, Sunwell for example being the last one, and see what to do on boss and trash encounters, so when it goes live, they know more what to do. It saves actual game time, actual game funds, and means they can move onto gearing up the whole group, rather than wiping on the first boss, as nobody has a clue what to expect.</div></div><hr />

Knowing the right way to do something doesn't mean you will be able to pull it off. Certain tactics will still require players to think when in combat, and react accordingly when situations change.<br />

Regarding making the game more casual? Blizzard would be the one making that so, as they choose to make the instances difficult or not.</div></div><hr />

They wish to be successful in WOTLK, by doing research now. No 5 mans are really hard enough to need a guide anyways. And I am pretty sure this is not making WoW more casual, because only people who want to progress fast (i.e hardcore raiderz) will take the time to research this. SO if you do not like it, don't read it. Keep in mind also, that knowing what to do, and the ability of players to successfully execute are 2 different things.</div></div><hr />

Coming from someone in the industry I can make the game multiple times harder if I didn't tell you what to do to win. Of course you can't give the player nothing otherwise they will get frustrated and quit all together. But giving details like this so early is uncalled for. And yes it does promote casuals which much of the wow community is concerned with and this also answers varithorns reply too. <br />
<br />
Also verithorns. This guide is only a google search away. Don't give me only &quot;hardcore raiders will take the time to read this.&quot; Anyone that just wants immediate gratification will take 5 minutes to read it if it means getting a epic.</div></div><hr />

If you do not like it, quit. IT IS BETA NOW. Meaning everyone and their mommas who got in to beta can post about all the neato shit that is going on. Hardcore raiders will probably take the time to research the first raid, but 5 mans are a joke anyway.</div></div><hr />

Of course you can't give the player nothing otherwise they will get frustrated and quit all together. But giving details like this so early is uncalled for. And yes it does promote casuals which much of the wow community is concerned with and this also answers varithorns reply too. <br />
<br />
Also verithorns. This guide is only a google search away. Don't give me only &quot;hardcore raiders will take the time to read this.&quot; Anyone that just wants immediate gratification will take 5 minutes to read it if it means getting a epic.<br />

Being in the gaming industry has nothing to do with making a game harder or easier if you are or are not going to tell people how an encounter can occur. Actually programming it to make it near impossible, or in some cases, actually impossible, (C'thun release, anyone?), will. Providing a kill can be obtained from an encounter with no exploits and such, people will obtain it eventually. The difficulty however will determine who even gets there, and who can get that kill. <br />
<br />
Look at the current guides for the Sunwell bosses, several of those came out before the Sunwell was released, as the timers on the &quot;Gates&quot; prevented a rush from the better raiding guilds out there. So what was done in the mean time was they were farmed on the test server so the tactics for the &quot;actual&quot; kills were refined. Still, you're not going to see casual players downing Kil'jaeden everyweek as it still requires players good enough to follow the tactics and react as the fight happens. <br />
<br />
Yes, so this guide may be for the first few instances out there, so we could compare it to Hellfire Citadel, with the Ramparts and Blood Furnace, but those were not exactly hard instances, even on release. Not everyone who is interested in the Beta content can access it, the NDA has been lifted, so people are allowed to post information about instances/gear/classes and specs/Murlocs. The amount of people that read it comes down to those who can motivate themselves to do so. It's a question of choice, and it's not yours to make on others behalves.</div></div><hr />

I'll tell you what. Since you don't wish to experience the game first hand and rather read &quot;I win&quot; notes based on some other player in beta months before official release we'll just make the experience harder. :)</div></div><hr />

Go ahead, I like challenging fights. You are however assuming I'm going to read the tactical notes released regarding the Wrath instances. I'm not, but then again, I can't prove that, so it doesn't really matter.<br />
If you're unhappy with how the instances are being designed, if they are too easy, then try and change that, if you can. But another point to mention would be, that if you are someone who has designed the instance and it's encounters, then you know exactly what happens in those fights, moreso than anyone that will run the instance and later put up a guide.</div></div><hr />
