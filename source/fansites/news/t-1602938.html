You WILL notice the difference.. You have a good indicator on the dmg meter, as well as you got the nice measurement with the wave timer. You can see wave by wave how many seconds you got left compared to before... <br />

<br />
well last time i done it i was in better gear than the 1st time now i got almost 650 ilvl it would help if the beta was up also you need a raid to see how other class/spec compair to each other last build on operater i was mid pac wiht a mm near the top and that was lat week so.<br />
<br />
tho i did notice a buff to bm in the 2 f mans i did and the other 2 dps were a ret and i think a frost mage all of us seemed equal at thims wiht the mage falling behind most other times so that being said the scaling is there and some fixes has een made but where it will truely be noticable is in the raids</div></div><hr />

Yes! Either that, or nerf purge and dispells, either increase mana cost or give them cds.<br />
Most classes have a way to restore mana, now only arcane mages can restore mana in combat and also has the most expensive dispell of all other classes.<br />
Spellsteal = has a chance to miss, steals 1 enemy buff, costs 33400 mana = ~1/5 of mage mana.<br />
While Purge costs a little over 9k mana(also im not sure if it has miss chance like spellsteal), and shamans have a way to restore mana, mages dont.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Still no shadow priest changes.<br />
<br />
As far as ive tested Spriest, they don't rly need much changes. Even tho i consider myself as a bad Spriest i still get like 60+% win rate on duels, and win over 50% of the skirmishes. Imo they are pretty good atm.<br />
The only thing that needs to change is not for the Spriest, but melee mobility, coz there is no way casters can kite melee right now rly, only palas are kite-able and that doesnt rly matter coz they can burst you from range if they want.<br />
Also a lot of CC removers should be nerfed/cut just cuz:<br />
DK: Lich born, AMS, trinket, desecrated ground, Icebound fortitude, racial(stone skin(OP after buff), EMfH, WotF) = 6 possible trinkets<br />
Warr: maybe cd increase on berserker rage, 30 sec cd fear trinket is kinda insane, could get a root breaker or smth<br />
Rogue: Burst of speed = too much<br />
Druid: shapeshift slows/roots = too much</div></div><hr />

That's an option, but i guarantee u the QQ would reach the heavens if that happens. A simpler option would be just to make fire mage hot streaks undispelable and give a dispel protection for our dots.<br />
Currently we are like this:<br />
Facing an ofensive dispeller = No pyros.<br />
Facing a defensive dispeller = No dots.<br />
Facing both = Utterly fucked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the least appealing expac I've seen in history. I usually don't whine about expacs in WoW, even MoP was interesting because it was different. WoD is literally the same thing we have done. You can see this in WC2, Outlands, etc. It has all been done before.<br />
<br />
Also there is less raids promised, less dungeons, less content than ever before. But I bet we still will be waiting for a year or more on the last tier.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it's nice to know that if we ever have a boss that requires zero movement warriors will be competitive... oh, the horror.<br />
<br />
Warriors have the best mobility of any melee class aside from maybe the monk, so your input is not valid. thats ok this should be the patch of the warrior. they have been shit on in sooo many expacks in the past. i aint mad at em</div></div><hr />

Nothing against warriors btw...<br />
<br />
Warriors aren't fun at the start of an expac due to crit scaling. Warriors rely on crit to be enraged and use an ability. Since crit starts off low, you have to buff warriors attacks to make them viable. They buffed a spender, and a spell reliant on crits on Bloodthirst. <br />
<br />
You have little actual insight on gameplay other than just seeing % increases, it seems.</div></div><hr />

I have plenty of insight on gameplay, having done quite a bit of Fury testing on the beta(one of my mains is a Fury Warr). My consensus, they play like crap and have no spec identity.<br />

Pretty sure Fury 2h is parsing extremely high right now in SoO at high gear lvls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, every time I see a post about changes everyone else gets bumped up. But all the druid ones are down. I really hope they were extremely OP in beta for awhile. Or maybe I should consider playing another class in WoD.</div></div><hr />
