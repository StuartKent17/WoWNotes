The code for the in-game World of Warcraft pet that was provided in the goodie bag at the 2008 Worldwide Invitational will be usable at the Pet Redemption Webpage (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/misc/promotion.html) after patch 2.4.3 is released. After you have received the in-game code from this webpage, the Alliance will travel to Stormwind and the Horde to Undercity to visit a new NPC where you will be able to claim the in-game pet. The pet itself will be a miniature version of the Archangel Tyrael of Diablo 2 fame who will travel with you on all your grand adventures in Azeroth! Pictures of this amazing new pet will be available on the official website soon for everybody to check out.<br />

<br />

<br />
If it wasn't such a big nerf, how is it REALLY going to hurt rogues? /sarcasm.<br />

We are still going to be seeing 4/5 S3 4/8 T6 rogues do well in arena despite these changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm glad 2.4.3 is being deployed though, gives me some money to waste on those bags and 20 minutes to waste on the Durnholde quest. It's also nice to see an herbalism bag, so I'll be picking one of those up as well.<br />
<br />
The thing I'm mostly concerned about is the M'uru nerf. The encounter was perfect (yes, I have taken part in it a few times) and very challenging. It made guilds stand out, showed true skill, etc. Even though the core of the fight will generally be the same, the DPS requirement was a main part of the encounter and everyone needed to play their A-game. You still do now, but I just feel sorry for the guilds that were just not getting into P2 consistently and were (hopefully) going to get a kill this coming week and now their accomplishments will probably feel quite diminished. I know I'd be upset if we wiped on Entropious at 1% yesterday and killed him today all because of an HP change.<br />
<br />
However, I do agree with the Kil'jaden nerf(?). It makes the encounter a lot less random, which is generally a good thing in my opinion (random in the way a player cannot control it at all, that is).<br />
<br />
Overall, I'll be glad when the servers come back up. Finally I'll have something to do for a week or so instead of sitting around doing dailies and playing the casual WSG. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the correct solution would be taking hemo out of the 4 part t6 bonus. They already nerfed hemo in PvE with this change (Hi zkygge :p) so taking it of t6 and putting it back in sub tree wont be any large change for PvE from current nerf esp since they are so few now, it wont be any change at all for PvP geared rogues, which by the way are quite fine nowadays. It will only hit the 4/5+4/8 rogues, which currently are what most refer to as &quot;Rogues being OP&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it. To get the full damage reduction from cheat death will need 90 / 4 / 2 * 39.4 = 443.25 resillience. That is a lot of resillience to get wearing 4 pieces of T6. Even if a rogue drops to 400 resillience that will give them 400 / 39.4 * 2 * 4 = 81% damage reduction when cheat death procs. In effect they will be taking double damage during the cheat death proc making them far more vulnerable.</div></div><hr />

Thats completely different. I'm sure Blizzard didn't intend those boots/cloaks to be used to go from one WSG flag straight to the other, and for those boots to be used as a &quot;get me the hell out of here&quot; in arena.</div></div><hr />

Well it's not like there is any use to them outside of pvp besides speeding up an instance run after a wipe. Plus there is the whirlwind effect at the end and the occasional backfire which does more harm then good in an arena.</div></div><hr />

Despite your poor grammar, I will respond to you with the assumption that you graduated middle school. You're missing the point. Aside from all those classes you just listed have 2 other pvp viable specs, (and there are a lot more fire mages than non-resto druid in high 1800s) if you are going to fix something like non-dispellable buffs for a few classes, you kinda have to do it for all of them. Examples are OOC, demon armor, and water shield, things that can only be cast on one's self.</div></div><hr />

Wow, that really does suck.

i became an engineer a long time ago because of the neat pvp items. i am an engineer now because my raids need repair bots.<br />

it's obvious that they needed to get these out of the arena since you can't use anything else there, but i don't understand why they didn't just do this with the patch that took away all stats and made you drop wsg flags. &quot;guys, let's soften it a bit and nerf them over time...&quot;... ooooo, new concept: N.O.T.

As an RPer on an RP-PvP Realm I can honestly say everyone, on both factions, were upset to hear about the Kodo not being available to Alliance players who wanted it.<br />

This is not due to some RP'er QQing, it's just one of Blizzard's random decisions.<br />

QQ more alliance. I play alliance so my idea was &quot; Just hare! &quot; But the more I think about it, I don't really agree with seeing much of the horde running around in Dalaran.. I mean it wouldn't have made sense when it was up and running the first time around. The only race that could be excusable in Dalaran from the horde is the elves but even then High Elf &gt; Blood Elf.<br />

Although I do hate losing to priests that rocket boot away at 10% then get 2 Gheals off, this was something that had to be done.

if anything it resembles the warlock's mount the closest (flaming feet, glowing feet, shape)<br />
followed by the human mount (armor, glowing eyes, shape)<br />
and only then followed by the skeletal steeds of the forsaken (skirt, flaming feet)<br />

If you seriously think that priests doing better than would be expected in a perfectly balanced system in all three arena brackets has nothing whatsoever to do with the priest class you are deluded.<br />

<br />
I'm glad 2.4.3 is being deployed though, gives me some money to waste on those bags and 20 minutes to waste on the Durnholde quest. It's also nice to see an herbalism bag, so I'll be picking one of those up as well.<br />
<br />
The thing I'm mostly concerned about is the M'uru nerf. The encounter was perfect (yes, I have taken part in it a few times) and very challenging. It made guilds stand out, showed true skill, etc. Even though the core of the fight will generally be the same, the DPS requirement was a main part of the encounter and everyone needed to play their A-game. You still do now, but I just feel sorry for the guilds that were just not getting into P2 consistently and were (hopefully) going to get a kill this coming week and now their accomplishments will probably feel quite diminished. I know I'd be upset if we wiped on Entropious at 1% yesterday and killed him today all because of an HP change.<br />
<br />
However, I do agree with the Kil'jaden nerf(?). It makes the encounter a lot less random, which is generally a good thing in my opinion (random in the way a player cannot control it at all, that is).<br />
<br />
Overall, I'll be glad when the servers come back up. Finally I'll have something to do for a week or so instead of sitting around doing dailies and playing the casual WSG. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm really annoyed by the M'uru Nerf, 3 of Our Melee DPS managed to kill the adds sides with 3 seconds left to spare, Decreasing their health by 15% (confirmed?) is quite a darn big nerf and yes I feel sorry for us too, We had an upcoming definate kill this week and then they nerf it =(<br />
<br />
The less health the adds have the longer we can affort to stay on M'uru before even engaging the adds, The basics of the fight still remains, though you can prob afford removing people from add killing to &gt; Sentinel (M'uru dpsing even) which is gonna prove phase 1 to be alot faster and easier &lt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Horde- Tiger (ZG), Horse (Kara/Halloween), Ram (old brewfest)<br />
<br />
it's actually even right now, the kodo WOULD throw off the balance though<br />
if i felt like being a jerk and counting it, horde also gets the night elf area's flying taxi, the hippogryph<br />
<br />
<br />
Explain to me how a Death Knights horse is Horde??? The Kara/Hallo's End mount is neutral or that which doesn't belong to Horde or Alliance. Has more in common with the Warlock's, bear, etc mount which is another non faction mount then anything else. So thats 3 to 2 Alliance. Now if we look closer, (and I haven't verified this yet but) I don't think the Horde can get the Brewfest Ram any more and was a one time deal, which actually means for new players, or people who didn't get it that they are S.O.L. So really from this point its 3 to 1 Alliance. At the moment we do have access to the Hippogryph but seeing that WotLK is going to add a ton of new mounts, both flying and non, I have a feeling we will see Bats or Dragonhawks available for exalted purchase somewhere soon. So could give you a point back there, but you lot should not forget that we never got our equivalent grind mount like your Winterspring Tiger.</div></div><hr />

You can now exchange your T6 for a new piece of T6. I.E. SP gloves can be traded for Holy priest gloves.<br />
A few in my guild tried it, a Shammy, a War, &amp; a Priest &amp; all got &quot;Do you want to exchange&quot; from the vendor.</div></div><hr />
