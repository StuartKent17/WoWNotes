I will probably start talking about recruitment again, the pre-WotLK beta recruitment wasn't really succesful and I'm still looking for people to update the site/moderate the forums. (Don't start spamming my mailbox now, a post will be made later)<br />

Death Knight first level 80<br />
It took some time to figure out who was first and who wasn't, but it looks like Dessembrae (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Mazrigos&amp;n=Dessembrae) from Eternal Corpse Council (http://www.eternalcorpsecouncil.com/) (EU-Mazrigos) was the first Death Knight to reach level 80 in the world on November 15 at 19:00 CEST !

According to the reports, Essay (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Tichondrius&amp;n=Essay) (US-Tichondrius) was the first death knight to reach level 80 in the United States a few hours later, at 10:00PM server time. <br />

Blue posts<br />
It's not like there is a lot of activity lately because developpers are obviously super-busy now that the game is live but there is a bunch of free realm transfers and a few other things. <br />
Collector's Edition Pet<br />
It is an account-bound item you can send in the mail to any of your characters on that account. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/6848296620-question-abt-collectors-edition-ingame-pet.html))<br />
<br />
&quot;Breadcrumbs&quot; quests<br />
These quests are considered &quot;breadcrumbs&quot;, Honker... burger. So if you've already been to Stars' Rest in Dragonblight and taken Courier Lanson's quest to fly to Wintergarde the Private Casey quest will no longer be available.<br />
<br />
We do not count breadcrumb quests toward zone achievements FYI. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/14/12661300614-random-quests-not-showing-up-on-questgivers.html))<br />
<br />
Respawn rates<br />
We're hotfixing respawn rates that we deem problematic as we find them, folks. Sorry for the inconvenience. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/14/12661300520-waiting-for-respawns-is-not-epic.html))<br />
<br />
WotLK Account / TBC Client<br />
Yes, you can play with a Burning Crusade account on a Wrath of the Lich King client. But, you cannot play a Wrath of the Lich King enabled account on a Burning Crusade client. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12662130632-question.html))<br />
<br />
Where did the developers go ????<br />
The game just shipped. We've been a little busy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12661602417-where-did-gc-go.html))<br />
<br />
DPS of Healing specs<br />
1) Our goal was never to make all specs exceptional at dps. We did want to improve the dps of all the healing specs though.<br />
2) We do think Holy paladin dps is too low.<br />
3) Resto shammy and druid probably aren't that great either.<br />
4) We do have plans to improve these, but we don't think your dps is so awful that you will have difficulty leveling. Certain classes and specs have always excelled at leveling, which means others are going to be slower. If your leveling rate is too low for your comfort, you can respec.

Upcoming feral tanking itemization changes<br />
I have made so many Feral threads that I actually chilled on it a little because there were so many cries of favoritism. But I think on reflection, and as this thread suggests, I can't win on that regard so I might as well just reply to whatever threads I want to. <br />
<br />
If your Ulduar gear has more armor on it than your Naxx gear (and it does), then it scales. You still need rings, necks and trinkets with tanking stats on them. You are just free now to look at other things beyond just the bonus armor value (which is still useful BTW).<br />
<br />
Your Dodge diminishes, but it diminishes slower than warrior Dodge, since it's all you have. You get a huge benefit to Stamina (around 50%), so it scales very well.<br />
<br />
We're not that worried with what Feral tanking stats will be in later raid content, but as always, if one class ends up outstripping the others, we'll compensate for it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12666299730-cry-more--response.html))<br />
<br />
Swipe<br />
One quick question. I'm sure you've seen all the threads-- do you still believe bears are adequate AE tanks? Can you please answer our concerns with swipe's limitations and thorns' lack of scaling?<br />
<br />
Thorns really isn't designed to be something like Damage Shield. That is an avenue to explore if bears started to fall behind for any reason.<br />
<br />
I don't personally have any difficulty using Swipe (and I've tried all four AE abilities). It requires slightly more positioning to use, but not so much that I really fear that bears won't be brought on raids. Although I understand why Ferals like to downplay it, warriors do have concerns that bears will be more desired because of heals, Innervate and Rebirth. It's going to be difficult to really make everything identical, and that's not really the goal.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/hunter.jpg Hunter (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=620) / Talent Calc. (9095) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?hunter))<br />
Hunters and PvP<br />
Do we think hunters were underpowered in the previous Arena seasons? Yes.<br />
Do we think they will continue to be underpowered? We don't know yet.<br />
ZOMG didn't the beta prove that hunters are still underpowered? This requires more explanation. PvP relationships are notoriously difficult to theorycraft. Mostly it just takes a lot of games. While we had some talented players in beta, it's still a very small sample size. Nobody was playing with their &quot;real&quot; character. Few players went through the effort to gear up (meaning enchant, gem and try out options) the way they will on Live. The balance in beta was changing very rapidly, including many bug fixes. We did give hunters some new abilities, some of them potent, and we did change several other aspects of combat that will affect balance. Hunter dps is by most accounts on the top of the charts in PvE, so clearly the problem is more complex than just buffing dps. We also realize that PvP balance can change over time without us doing anything? How can that be? Well, players experiment and adapt. New strategies and counters arise. Now that isn't an excuse for us to never address balance problems, but it is an acknowledgement that balance is dynamic, not static, even without our involvement.<br />
Will we take steps to adjust hunters if they continue to be weak in Arenas? Yes. This is absolutely a concern of ours. To some extent my reputation is on the line here because I keep trying to assure players that we will make adjustments, and I know you'll throw it back in my face if we don't deliver. The game has only been out for a few days though, so it's just premature to make sweeping changes yet. I realize some knowledgeable hunters are convinced the changes we made were not enough. At the end of the day though, it is us, not the players, who need to make decisions about game design. We will always listen to your feedback when making our decisions though.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/paladin.jpg Paladin (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / Talent Calc. (9095) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Protection Tree<br />
There are several similar threads on Prot paladin issues so forgive me for only responding to this one. My thanks also go out to other players who have tried to respond here. I will comment on a couple of things --<br />
<br />
Righteous Defense -- We're not sure yet if we want to change this ability (possibly through glyph) or just add a normal taunt (for free -- not the 11 point talent). Both designs have their advantages.<br />
<br />
Health -- While I do think the &quot;huge differences&quot; between warrior and paladin health pools are a wee bit exaggerated, we do have an opportunity to provide paladins with a little more health when we change Divine Protection and Divine Shield. The benefit of Sacred Duty to remove the attack speed penalty will be unnecessary with this change, so we thought we might add additional Stam to this talent instead. (The cooldown could stay the same.)<br />
<br />
We're keeping a close eye on tank performance in general as players start to run the Northrend instances. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12643744594-tankadins-arent-very-happy-gc.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking and TPS<br />
Seriously though, it was the latter. The TPS may be an issue or it may not be. Players sometimes get worried about scaling (which is a totally valid thing to think about), but forget that some relationships won't show up in the current expansion. To use an extreme example, if one class outstrips another class when both have 20,000 attack power, then it's not something we're really worried about.<br />
<br />
I will also add that paladin TPS started to eclipse warrior TPS in Black Temple just because the former scaled so well. A lot of the warrior threat at the time was just +threat abilities, while the paladins did more damage to generate more threat. They were really only limited by the lack of gear.<br />
<br />
I don't point that out to say it will or won't be a problem. I just point it out to point it out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12643744594-tankadins-arent-very-happy-gc.html))<br />

Tapping mobs with DoTs<br />
We just talked about this and agree that it's dumb you have to go to such theatrics just to tag a mob. We'll try to get this fixed. [...] No, we should just be able to make a spell tag regardless of how it does damage. That would be the more robust implementation.

<br />
first off, look at the level-timer he has in his chat box... 3 minutes..<br />
<br />
then notice that the achievements are still up over his skills.<br />
<br />
also notice that the level-up graphic is still displayed and the experience gain is also still displayed.<br />
<br />
So either that timer is for level 79 and he did the entirity of lvl 79 in under 4 minutes. Duely impossible, even for a rush-gamer.<br />
<br />
Or this is a fake with achievements and stats posted over the SS itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As soon as he dinged 80 he would have taken a SS and immediately logged off to avoid the 10 million whisper spams.<br />
<br />
When he logged back on after it had calmed down a bit he took a SS of his /played and photoshoped it into the screenie. Simple really.</div></div><hr />

If you look more closely at the image, it's actually clearly made from two pictures:<br />
* on the right, a screenshot taken when he reached 80<br />
* on the left, a screenshot taken 4 minutes later (probably after he dealt with all the congratulations from his guildmates, friends and complete strangers), hence the 3 minutes and 58 seconds played at that level (80).<br />

Having a life is a relative term. If by &quot;having no life&quot;, you mean being better and faster then you are. Yes, he has no life. I personally feel no personal accomplishment by watching tv, football, other stupid mindless things people do which those people count as &quot;having a life&quot;. I have a girlfriend and yes I have sex, but other then that my life consists of work and games.<br />
<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
Because I fucking like it that way. :)<br />

I can't tell you how many times I DoT up a mob and some melee or burst class comes along and steals the mob before my DoTs tick. I really don't want to blow a soul shard to pull with Shadowburn.<br />
<br />
What is going to happen if they fix this, though, is that this will cause many warlocks to become total douchebags and DoT the hell out of everything in an area to steal mobs, and then Blizzard will swing a nerf bat. There are always those who ruin it for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

That ^^ I mean, really, what's &quot;life&quot;? To me it's playing games, parties and working/making money. Sometimes individual parts of my &quot;life&quot; take priority, like hitting top level when a new xpack comes out or going out to a bar when my friend from 10 hours away comes over. If that person found leveling a DK to 80 more fun that weekend - good for them, they accomplished it and had fun... although it's even better than that, they actually managed not only to have fun but also to piss some haters off chanting &quot;No life rawrarwar&quot; and then going back to watching TV.</div></div><hr />

actually, if you look closely at the two SS you will see that essay lvled in less time, 3 hours faster in fact. and considering that the US got the game After EU, ima go ahead and say your statement is completely false. the &quot;world first's&quot; going to EU are only because you guys got the game sooner so sit, and pipe down pls.<br />
<br />
also to those who say these ppl getting world firsts have no life, you are really not looking at the bigger picture, they spent 2-4 days of 1 week to lvl. out of a much longer life, it was something to do, cram some caffeine, skip work or class for a couple days and become internationally recognized for your accomplishment. they could easily go back to clubbing or what ever the hell you think qualifies as having a life now. Don't belittle their achievements as something only a &quot;no lifer&quot; could obtain. they just won a gaming marathon, and should feel damn proud. grats to them all</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skiball</div><div class="date">2008-11-18, 01:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a thought for Blizz in their comments about paladin HP while tanking:<br />
<br />
Move reckoning, as currently configured, into the ret tree. It is not the super one shot Doom lord talent any more so it can be put back to ret and it is really useless in the prot tree because it is too far down the tree for any PVP Ret to grab it. Not to mention it is useless for raid tanks anyway unless they have extra points sitting around, which thet don't. Rets can grab it at 80 but they have to sacrifice divine storm and righteous vengeance to do so. <br />
<br />
In conclusion, move Reckoning to the Ret tree and replace those 5 points with a stam talent of some kind, maybe even tied into an ability to increase righteous defense's effectiveness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So few people will ever appreciate or notice a Malazan reference. With a name as kickass and appropriate as that, Dessembrae deserves the props. :P I had debated a Malazan naming style for my DK, but most good names were male, and I didn't want any male alliance races...the only ones I can really stand to play are gnomes, and that's not exactly appropriate for the names. :P<br />

<br />
first off, look at the level-timer he has in his chat box... 3 minutes..<br />
<br />
then notice that the achievements are still up over his skills.<br />
<br />
also notice that the level-up graphic is still displayed and the experience gain is also still displayed.<br />
<br />
So either that timer is for level 79 and he did the entirity of lvl 79 in under 4 minutes. Duely impossible, even for a rush-gamer.<br />

Or this is a fake with achievements and stats posted over the SS itself.<br />

Actually it's members of my guild, not me. Moderators are free to check the IP of the posts. It's no big deal, I wasn't even actively trying to get world or US first, only realm first. Once players of my realm saw this MMO-Champion update and were like hey Sinzarx hit 80 way before that, they started messaging me about it, and thus I came here to correct the information. I've send 2 emails to the site mods, as well as these posts, but either they are too busy and haven't seen my messages yet, or the real first to 80 is now old news and don't care. Either way, I'm not super concerned.</div></div><hr />

As far as the no life thing, he is right and the &quot;real world&quot; would agree so you can say w/e the fuck you want in your own mind but people going 25 levels in that amount of time are fucking losers. So go tuck your one inch cock back in your pants no one is impressed.<br />

Peace<br />
