<br />
I highly doubt that will happen because Wrath of the Lich King is still not completed as far as the &quot;Lich King&quot; lore.. and I believe that Blizzard had originally planned expansions every two years. No reason to introduce another expansion when the current expansion hasn't even been completed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By Blizzcon, we'll be almost a year into Lich King. They're going to announce the new expansion then giving a full year and a half lead time on it in traditional Blizz style. Pity I won't play it, WoW is too much of a time sink that I'd rather get back. There won't be an mmo announcement because they need to get Starcraft 2 and Diablo3 out of the door running. A year after they're released we'll see the earliest announcements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Close. They actually said that they would like to release an expansion once every year. Burning Crusade was released on January 16th 2007, and Wrath of the Lich King on November 13th 2008.<br />
<br />
Granted, the release dates are almost 2 years apart, they still are released &quot;once a year&quot;. If they are to hold onto that idea, they would have to release the next expansion, latest December 2009, or if going by the nearly 2 year time between Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King, more likely around August-September 2010.<br />
<br />
Either way, the next expansion would have to be announced well before that.<br />
<br />
IN ADDITION: Blizzard has said they are considering revamping the graphics further, with the next major expansion. This if done, is likely not an easy task and will take quite some time to complete.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard announced WoTLK at the 2007 BlizzCon, with the beta being playable by 2008's.<br />
<br />
If they legitimately plan to continue the series, the next in line will be announced this year.</div></div><hr />

wellll...I just wanna hear about the WoW live action movie they had planned. Been a couple years or more since they announced anything on it. Last we all heard they were picking a cast for the characters and getting screenplay written and figuring out who would produce the movie.<br />
did they just drop the idea of a huge theatrical production like this after the announcements? <br />
/want to know. be demanding.<br />
<br />
;D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Insanara</div><div class="date">2009-02-17, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree on the theory of the new mmo being announced, however I am more interested in the date they have set.<br />
Previously the Bcons have been set for October. So either they don't like the month, or they want to launch it before the release of SC2 (similar to the fact that they had Blizzcon before Wotlk release).<br />
It is just thoughts, bring yours!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no Worldwide Invitational this year is there? Last year, that was in early Summer with Blizzcon in the autumn, so this year, with no WWI and only 1 major event for them, it makes a bit more sense to have it roughly in the middle of it.<br />
<br />
I thought by then the first part of Starcraft 2 should be almost out of the door (if it's not already - I'd heard the first part was due Easter, 2nd in Autumn and 3rd next year). Diablo 3 news though? Maybe the beta would be starting around then? And the timing would be right for any next expansion announcement for WoW as well (WotLK announced the summer after TBC was launched wasn't it?). Although, I also think it took them a bit longer (about 6 months extra) to get WoTLK finished than they originally thought it would so they could wait a bit longer before announcing any new expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Who says it's an RPG?<br />
<br />
All i heard was MMO :o<br />
<br />
They've got a record-breaking mmorpg...<br />
<br />
They might be looking at trying something else :o</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ev@n</div><div class="date">2009-02-19, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe there gonna release a chain of Warcrafts again with a TON of new lore. Then release WoW 2. with all of that lore tied in. and then somehow connect WoW and WoW 2. o.O</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ent0mbed</div><div class="date">2009-02-19, 06:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think they'd show the next WoW expansion at this years BlizzCon. They'll really need to have atleast Icecrown out before then (patch 3.3.). <br />
<br />
Why??? They can announce a product whenever they want. Keeping in mind when they make the announcement it will be well over a year before it's an actual product in our hands. Even if they announce the next expansion it will be purely concept with &quot;maybe&quot; one stripped down zone for people at the convention to look at. When WotLK was announced all we got to see was a pretty empty and limited version of Howling Fjord with Utgarde Keep playable and some concept art. These guys are good at what they do and I have no doubt they could whip out something like that in a matter of weeks seeing as the game engine already exists.<br />
<br />
I'd like think we'll see:<br />
- More on the classes/game mechanics in D3 with more opportunities to sit down and play the updated version.<br />
- An opportunity to sit down and play SC2 as it will be when the beta begins (maybe the announcement of the beta if it hasn't started by then).<br />
- High quality cinematic for SC2 to open the event.<br />
- New expansion announced for WoW (accompanied by a lower quality in game machinima featuring zones in progress). Hard to say what details they'll release as the ones they announced for WotLK kind of shot them in the ass (i.e. we still don't have new dances in the game even though they were announced at **Blizzcon '07**).<br />
<br />
I don't think they'll touch on the new MMO or the movie.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumps</div><div class="date">2009-02-19, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Likely this is their platform for announcing the next MMO<br />
<br />
<br />
What are you smoking? ;D<br />
<br />
They won't announce that for another 3-4 years, and the next wow expansion at the end of this year.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2009-02-19, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure whether or not I want to go again, but after going once, you really understand the do's and don't's of Blizzcon.

<br />
<br />
o.O What's that mean? What are these &quot;do's and don't's&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder why they're moving it to August. October is generally nice here in Southern California but August is hot as hell. Not to mention that October is already cold in other parts of the country so the out of state people who visit Blizzcon generally get to come here when the weather's better than in their home state.<br />
<br />
<br />
And it's juuust too late for me. Most colleges (and even lower education, 1st-12th grades) start sometime between the beginning and middle of August. If only it was 3 weeks earlier. :(<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This just in; you will need to drive in vehicles to be able to arrive at the convention.<br />
<br />
<br />
