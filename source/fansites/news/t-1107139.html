Temple of the Jade Serpent Instance Preview<br />
Our lovely Nik (watch our stream! (http://www.twitch.tv/mmo_champion)) went through the Temple of the Jade Serpent instance currently available for testing and made a quick video preview of the instance! Now with more monsters, evil bosses, and comments!<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Pet Battle System and Pet Journal Preview<br />
Let's discuss the Pet Battle System and the upcoming Pet Journal! The features aren't really implemented on beta yet but datamining yielded a decent amount of data to work with! We also have a small video preview of the Pet Journal.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Hunting Wild Pets<br />
Acquiring wild pets will be done by tracking them on your minimap, we don't really have details on the entire process/fight but some of those pets will be much rarer than the others. Spawn conditions could depend on the time of the day or the weather in the zone you're in! <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
However, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will spend forever browsing the web looking for spawn locations. The game will apparently include a convenient map to show you where you are likely to encounter a specific pet. <br />

<br />
<br />
Pet Types<br />
There is currently 10 pet types in the game. Each type can be strong or weak against another type, for example, Dragonkin attacks deal bonus damage to Flying companions and less damage to other Dragonkin and Water companions. All the details are in the pet skills chart below! <br />

<br />
<br />
Pet Skills<br />
We also have a (mostly) complete of pet skills as of today, keep in mind that this is early beta and the feature isn't even implemented yet. A lot of that stuff is likely to change.<br />

He'll grow tentacles and start casting &quot;Mini Cataclysm.&quot; Then Lil' Nozdormu, Lil' Alexstraza, Lil' Kalecgos, and Lil's Ysera will assist the Argent Gruntling and a group of 10-25 Lil' Raiders fight back while Lil' Deathwing splashes around in the Lil' Maelstrom Kiddie Pool.<br />

This guy Nik, playing the Rogue, is a complete ass and is the &quot;gogogo&quot; guy. In his first group that he got, he bitched about the tank taking &quot;too long&quot; to pull stuff and when they wiped on the second boss like four times the tank tabbed out to try and find a strat for the fight. Then the Rogue kept dps'ing the wrong add in the fight when it's stacks were up at 8 after he said they need to switch at 5 but blamed other people for the wipe (when he said the 5 stack strategy &quot;didn't work out&quot;). Tried vote kicking the tank and said &quot;I don't have time for this&quot; and asked the livestream viewers if he should bail. I'm sorry but this isn't Hour of Twilight dungeons, this is new shit with new mechanics and after dying four times, as a tank I would start looking up strategies too. If he doesn't have time for it maybe he shouldn't be doing this type of thing. It's beta testing, it's learning and some things may be bugged so perhaps a bit of research to see if an encounter is even doable is in order. The guy is an elitist ass and how he ever got legendary daggers boggles the mind if he can't even watch stacks on a mob without getting tunnel vision on his own damage complaining &quot;oh I can't get any combo points.&quot; That's not the point of the fight and bitching about it is stupid. It's a big mark against MMO-Champion to have their name on something run by someone that is such an elitist ass that he would do those things when the dungeon isn't even a day old. You want powerhouse group then form it yourself with people you know plain and simple. I don't think I'll be watching anymore of their livestream for this reason. You want to get a stream running for MMO Champion, be a bit more selective in the person you have running it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they're using the same attacks as what the Pokemon themselves use or any other names. That's a rip off. Games are allowed to copy playstyles of other games. Why are there so many WoW clones? And this isn't Pokemon if there's no poke balls right? I don't see anything wrong here.</div></div><hr />

I like that is shows you where/how to get the pets, and as was mentioned a couple of days ago, some of the more rare pets wont be simple 'turn up, get pet' for instance there's a ghost pet from outside Kara that only spawns late at night, shiz like this is what makes the difference between a good game, and a GREAT game, IMO ;) Also, best news of the whole video?

Me neither but I'll still check it out. There's been plenty of things in WoW I wasn't interested in at first but once I tried them out they turned out to be more fun than I imagined. I imagine when people are waiting for dugeon or LFR queues this is what they're going to be doing which is better than nothing. <br />

<br />
The pet battle system is only supposed to be a small part of the total endgame experience, along with raiding, PvP, loads of different methods of gaining reputation with so far a lot of different factions, and even new features such as dungeon challenges and pve scenarios. It is completely optional and definitely not worth getting a subscription based game for if you are not the least bit interested in the rest of it.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, even though many people like to complain about a system that is obviously hugely inspired by Pokémon, I don't see any harm in Blizzard implementing it, because the initial formula is extremely polished and addictingly fun. If in the end, people can enjoy themselves with pet battles, be it that they want to relax a bit before or after their main raid, or that they actually really got into the pet battling and want to 'be the very best', and that is what a gameplay mechanic should be about. I play games first and foremost for the fun and the great time I get out of it, and that counts for every game on every system I have played. I own games with virtually no story at all, just as well as games with inferior technical standarts, but I gladly play through them again every now and then because not a single day goes by that I don't remember at least 2-3 of them quite fondly.<br />
<br />
And finally and most importantly, you are never too old for Pokémon. Sure, the little pocket monsters are cute-looking and tha world is designed to be generally happy ending, but the essence of the game is incredibly fun. Saying only juvenile people can play these games or even regretting having played them yourself after enjjoying them a lot in the past is just terribly hyppocrite. I myself am well past what could be considered my 'Pokémon-playing age', but I don't care.

Partly it is.<br />
<br />
I used to be a die hard Pokemon fan, but it really doesn't have a place in WoW, IMO. The time spent on this could've been spent to improve other areas.<br />
What some people fail to understand is that an expansion cannot bring only amazing zones and dungeons/raid content. Sh*t gets boring after I've cleared the new raids with my 6 level 90's I leveled through the same zones. No matter how amazing a zone or raid is, it does get boring after a while, which is why they need to add new features, such as Archaeology and Pet Battles. It gives people something to do besides the usual World of Warcraft &quot;core&quot; system. This doesn't mean they will lower the quality of raids, it just means some people will pay for another month of game subscription, which makes them money, and that is what a company is all about: making money.</div></div><hr />

That's a rip off. Games are allowed to copy playstyles of other games. Why are there so many WoW clones? And this isn't Pokemon if there's no poke balls right? I don't see anything wrong here.<br />
<br />
You know, I once played this other MMO, which shall remain unnamed, but they had spells with the same names and the same effects for the same class as in WoW. It's hard not to call that a rip-off. Same principal here. The idea of pets battling isn't itself a problem. But now they're introducing types (like Pokemon), and giving types advantages/disadvantages over other types (like Pokemon), and every move has a &quot;power&quot; and &quot;accuracy&quot;, just like Pokemon. I'm going to call it a bit of a rip-off, and that assessment is pretty justified.</div></div><hr />

This was inevitable that WoW would put in a feature like this. And other MMOs are going to follow suit (Trion actually mentioned that they would in one of their 1.8 preview videos), not because it's &quot;what WoW is doing&quot; but it's what Zynga is doing.<br />
<br />
The truth of the matter is, that the 19-22 crowd of gamers that flocked to WoW back when it was at its height of popularity are now 24-27 years old. What are people in that age group doing now that they obviously weren't doing back 3-4 years ago? <br />
<br />
They're working. They are producing offspring. They are busy.<br />
<br />
Long after they have finally graduated college and withstood the 2007/8 economic downturn that made their post-college prospects dim (and made them unemployed for a few years) the economy has recovered enough for the mid-20's crowd that probably grew up with World of Warcraft now walk on to not just other games, but other TYPES of games -- simply because they cannot dedicate 5-6 hours a day to grinding dungeons/quests/raids like they used to. Because they are working jobs, they got married, and have an infant strapped to their backs that poops constantly. <br />
<br />
Guess what gaming company raked in billions of dollars for the last few years? Zynga. Why? Because you can devote 20 minutes of derping around in a Zynga game and then get back to your job/kids peeing everywhere/court documents/inane adult activites. I mean hell, look at Angry Birds. Just Angry Birds. Simple to learn, difficult to master, and you can play it for a few minutes on your cellphone/tablet while standing in line at the bank or parked outside of your 8-year-old's school to pick 'em up.<br />
<br />
A lot of computer users are going mobile, and want quick and easy-to-learn games to distract them. If they also happen to have a PC at home, they probably don't have the time to sit there at it for hours to do much of anything.<br />
<br />
So where does World of Warcraft come in? They put out LFD with heroics that can be completed in 20 minutes. They put in LFR, with Dragon Soul cut in half so that ideally your raid is done in an hour.<br />
<br />
Fast Food MMO content.<br />
<br />
But then you have players that might not really be into the hardcore dungeon running and raiding. Believe it or not, those people exist. I have a RealID list with at least 3 people who never raid, and have at least one level 85 character that they simply don't touch anymore because PvP and PvE simply don't interest them. They liked the crawling around of zones and chatting with people they know and standing around Goldshire or Orgrimmar. And if they didn't find people they knew online at the time, they usually alt-tabbed and played a Facebook game (which is very likely to be a Zynga game).<br />
<br />
Hence.... WoW Pet Battles.<br />
<br />
Go catch rare bunnies without resorting to a painful kill-10,000-dragons grind, then go pay your taxes. Play a series of quick-round pet vs. pet games against other players that you can't directly identify as being other players (which of course, is all key. PvP is normally a big turnoff for the crowd that Pet Battles is aimed at) then close up your laptop as you go to that meeting down the hall. Level the bunnies, then go to the store after work. Sell your level 99 superrare bunny on the auction house. Finally afford that epic flying! Afford leveling a profession! Finally get good crafted gear! Start doing dungeons.....<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
Pet Battles are microactivities to provide motivation for 'super-casual' gamers to continue to play World of Warcraft, and as a possible step to begin enjoying other parts of the game. It is revolutionary for a whole aspect of game players in the way that Arenas and the Resilience stat finally kicked open the doors for PvPers back in Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
If you feel that Pet Battles aren't for you? That's fine. You probably aren't in the feature's demographic anyways. A lot of people never felt Arenas were for them, and also lamented that there were better things for Blizzard to focus on rather than 4-10 players dancing around pillars in a closed room.

Well, considering Pokèmon at a competitive level is impossible to play as of gen 5th (because it has become completely umbalanced, just like wow pvp asd, while in gen 4th the competitive community managed to create a pretty balanced metagame...), this Pet Battle System could be seen as a &quot;pokèmon 2&quot; attempt, hoping it will remain a &quot;minigame&quot; and a minor feature, and won't get any further developement. <br />
The simpler, the better.</div></div><hr />

A Tamagotchi for every char that becomes your new pet if you just do the right shit to it? But since it seems like that 90% of the playerbase don't give a fuck for lore related things, as long as it looks scary, brutal, shiney with spikes and shit, probably due to the fact that they never touched Warcraft before WoW, they are still happy with their random evil fail set copied from random asian mmo x.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because having a pet that fights other pets are really important in a WARcraft game, are you going to WAR with your non-combat pet or something, so he can fight other pets of the opposite faction?<br />
I thought the idea was to have players fight players, not non-combat pets fight non-combat pets.<br />

I'm not Zanter but I would assume he pointing out that you're acting like a Internet kid. E.g. foul-mouthed and obsessed with trying to look old and experienced (using the words childish, kiddo, mommy a lot). It is quite hilarious to complain about a feature in a fantasy role-playing game (and not even one with &quot;adult&quot; content) being childish. I'm afraid I've got some sad news, the rest of the world think that you are pretty childish the minute you start to spend hours on a computer game. Personally I couldn't care less about childish or not, to me it's about how fun something is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zokten</div><div class="date">2012-03-30, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The people going &quot;BAWWW POKEMON IN MY WOW&quot; need to chill out for a second and listen.<br />
<br />
This was inevitable that WoW would put in a feature like this. And other MMOs are going to follow suit (Trion actually mentioned that they would in one of their 1.8 preview videos), not because it's &quot;what WoW is doing&quot; but it's what Zynga is doing.<br />
<br />
The truth of the matter is, that the 19-22 crowd of gamers that flocked to WoW back when it was at its height of popularity are now 24-27 years old. What are people in that age group doing now that they obviously weren't doing back 3-4 years ago? <br />
<br />
They're working. They are producing offspring. They are busy.<br />
<br />
Long after they have finally graduated college and withstood the 2007/8 economic downturn that made their post-college prospects dim (and made them unemployed for a few years) the economy has recovered enough for the mid-20's crowd that probably grew up with World of Warcraft now walk on to not just other games, but other TYPES of games -- simply because they cannot dedicate 5-6 hours a day to grinding dungeons/quests/raids like they used to. Because they are working jobs, they got married, and have an infant strapped to their backs that poops constantly. <br />
<br />
Guess what gaming company raked in billions of dollars for the last few years? Zynga. Why? Because you can devote 20 minutes of derping around in a Zynga game and then get back to your job/kids peeing everywhere/court documents/inane adult activites. I mean hell, look at Angry Birds. Just Angry Birds. Simple to learn, difficult to master, and you can play it for a few minutes on your cellphone/tablet while standing in line at the bank or parked outside of your 8-year-old's school to pick 'em up.<br />
<br />
A lot of computer users are going mobile, and want quick and easy-to-learn games to distract them. If they also happen to have a PC at home, they probably don't have the time to sit there at it for hours to do much of anything.<br />
<br />
So where does World of Warcraft come in? They put out LFD with heroics that can be completed in 20 minutes. They put in LFR, with Dragon Soul cut in half so that ideally your raid is done in an hour.<br />
<br />
Fast Food MMO content.<br />
<br />
But then you have players that might not really be into the hardcore dungeon running and raiding. Believe it or not, those people exist. I have a RealID list with at least 3 people who never raid, and have at least one level 85 character that they simply don't touch anymore because PvP and PvE simply don't interest them. They liked the crawling around of zones and chatting with people they know and standing around Goldshire or Orgrimmar. And if they didn't find people they knew online at the time, they usually alt-tabbed and played a Facebook game (which is very likely to be a Zynga game).<br />
<br />
Hence.... WoW Pet Battles.<br />
<br />
Go catch rare bunnies without resorting to a painful kill-10,000-dragons grind, then go pay your taxes. Play a series of quick-round pet vs. pet games against other players that you can't directly identify as being other players (which of course, is all key. PvP is normally a big turnoff for the crowd that Pet Battles is aimed at) then close up your laptop as you go to that meeting down the hall. Level the bunnies, then go to the store after work. Sell your level 99 superrare bunny on the auction house. Finally afford that epic flying! Afford leveling a profession! Finally get good crafted gear! Start doing dungeons.....<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
Pet Battles are microactivities to provide motivation for 'super-casual' gamers to continue to play World of Warcraft, and as a possible step to begin enjoying other parts of the game. It is revolutionary for a whole aspect of game players in the way that Arenas and the Resilience stat finally kicked open the doors for PvPers back in Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
If you feel that Pet Battles aren't for you? That's fine. You probably aren't in the feature's demographic anyways. A lot of people never felt Arenas were for them, and also lamented that there were better things for Blizzard to focus on rather than 4-10 players dancing around pillars in a closed room. And yet here we are.<br />
<br />
While a good post has to much &quot;speculation&quot; as a whole in it though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even pokemon is a copy of shin megami tensei, and the battle system is final fantasy all the way. So please lets not talk originallity here.<br />
<br />

<br />
The mere fact that you refer to things people may enjoy as &quot;poketards&quot; or &quot;dragonlol&quot; just shows how immature you are. You pretty much prove people right unwillingly, and embarass yourself in the process. You claim you're old enough to be the father of a 15 year old, yet you don't act like such... but then again, you don't need to be young to be immature. Don't be surprised when people jump on your throat and assume things about you when you act like an immature teenager, while calling those who like things kids or calling these things with derogatory terms attached.</div></div><hr />

You think Pokemon was original? Ever heard of dragon quest? There are others games like pokemon released earlier.<br />
And the turn based combat was introduced also in earlier Japanese RPG (like Final Fantasy and others).<br />
<br />
So no Blizz didn't copied from pokemon although they certainly had inspiration from it. Every single game is based on another. You can also say that WoW as a game is a copy from everquest, there are many similarities on both games.<br />
<br />
Every single game that exists now has a similar predecessor. There are only a very few indie games that try to be 100% original and even many of those have similarities to previous games.<br />
<br />
So stop being childish on this &quot;copy&quot; crap. Every time you see a comedy with teenagers you think the movie is a rip off from other previous movie with teenagers? Same with most action movies...<br />
<br />
And mystery books are they copies from one another too? They sure follow the same path in the story.<br />
<br />
Grow up and leave that childish crap behind. It ironic, to say the least, you calling this new feature childish because your attitude sure seems fit to it.</div></div><hr />

But do you guys think features like this is something pressed through by Activision to milk the potensial revenue WoW generates, or do you think Blizzard came up with this purely because it's a fun new feature to bring to the game?<br />
<br />
Personally I don't care either way as it's easy to just don't play this part of the game if you don't like it, but IF it's infact something forced through by Activision, I think it could have a negative impact on Blizzard and their creative control of their games, which has been in their own hands since day 1, and is known by everyone to be top notch.</div></div><hr />

Those shoulders shouldn't necessarily spew fire IMO, doesnt fit the cat like heads on it.Other than that its a pretty good set to start off with!<br />
<br />
The Warlock tier is really good again, just would like to see different animations to the Sha helmet.<br />
Not just the jaw opening every second, maybe have it twitch or transform a bit to make it more animated?</div></div><hr />

This comment here confuses me,as &quot;lore&quot; technically refers to history or in this case what went off pre Warcraft 1 - Warcraft 3.
