Legion - Gold Cap Raised to 10 Million Gold<br />

Legendary Item Effects in PvP<br />
Your understanding is correct. They will be disabled in all PvP instances, including unrated battlegrounds. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409422-will-legendary-effects-be-disabled-in-unrated-bgs/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743394515?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
World Quest Icons<br />
Skull Rare Elite WQs are Dungeon World Quests, requiring a dungeon group.<br />
<br />
Sounds like this iconography isn't particularly self-explanatory though, will pass that along to the UI guys. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409314-simple-question-for-devs-about-world-quests/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743314522?page=1#7))<br />
<br />
Order Hall Resources and Upgrades<br />
So the point is that you you guys thought this would be the end all be all resource dump since there really aren't any compelling rewards? Honestly I wish the team would've just decided to unlock the upgrades through quests rather than currency. Or am I missing some information?<br />
The primary source of Order Hall Resources is doing quests. We'll be laying out the details of Legion's endgame structure as we get closer to release - it feels premature to publish a blog on the subject while we're still iterating on exactly how all the pieces fit together, as well as tuning. But Legion has at least as much max-level outdoor content as Mists of Pandaria did, except with a different structure (world quests complemented by one-time story moments) that lets us offer more player choice and day-to-day variation, to avoid some of the pitfalls of Mists, where we heard player feedback about repetition and burnout.<br />
<br />
As for the subject of the thread, yeah, as Muffinus noted above, this is one of many different perks that you can unlock (or not), and is intended to offer a small time-saving convenience. If anything, it may end up being undesirable because of its limitations, and we wouldn't be willing to buff it to the point where it'd be truly &quot;strong&quot; because that would cut directly against the value, expressed many times here in this discussion, of actually going out and adventuring. We'll see how it plays out in further testing. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409302-cmon-blizz-are-we-doing-this-again/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743384500?page=9#177))<br />

Warcraft Movie<br />

Holy Paladin Feedback -- Build 21531 -- 21-Apr<br />
Tuning is still early and right now is drifting around a lot, as unrelated changes happen without necessarily being compensated for in terms of tuning. Looks like H Pal DPS is somewhat lower than other healers in this build (possibly largely due to the loss of Holy Bolt); we'll bring it up next build so it's in the ballpark before more detailed tuning happens.

Blue Tweets<br />
The Broken Shore<br />
soz just salty about how the alliance keeps getting boned it looks like<br />
you should wait for the Horde's side to pass judgement (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720427372336447488))<br />
<br />
seriously, da fuq? Why cant it be the Alliance that fuqs up? Its always the horde.<br />
Things are not always as one side sees them. The Horde may have a different perspective on how things went down at the end. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720419643278516225))<br />
<br />
Racials<br />
Arcane Torrent being on the GCD is a bug, and will be fixed in the next Alpha update. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720686270049943552))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
During the Demon Hunter early access, will we be able to explore Azeroth and maybe level profs before the expansion hits?<br />
During the pre-launch, you will be able to take your demon hunter wherever you please. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720681929012486144))<br />
<br />
Realm Hopping<br />
Any plans to stop people from 'realm-hopping' into raids trying to form then leaving at once?<br />
We realize it’s a major nuisance and we’re investigating solutions. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720761664853782528))<br />
<br />
BMAH<br />
Why is the Black market in Dalaran? the whole point of BMAH is its supposed to be in a dangerous unsafe area? now zero threat.<br />
Oh, but the Dalaran Underbelly is a hive of scum and villainy. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720760181122928640))<br />
<br />
Artifact Weapons<br />
Is it intentional that Artifact Relics cannot be removed from the Artifact once they've been placed?<br />
Yes. Relics will be replaced primarily on the basis of item level; they’re not meant to be Glyphs 2.0. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/720763957858861056))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
I love world pvp, I hate FFA arenas though. Why most of them? This game wasn't designed around 1v1.<br />
FFA is about as far from 1v1 as you can get (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720425492763922432))<br />
Then in that case it's just PvP guilds hoarding them, or waiting till 3 AM just to have a shot.<br />
Some options to consider: no grouping (full FFA), limited groups (max 5 man), buffing solo-ers. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720469173047058432))<br />
Most times I see groups of friends at FFA making it so that only their friend wins. Which isn't fun<br />
We're gonna make world PvP work here, please keep up the feedback! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/720476399610568704))<br />

<br />
It truly makes me wonder how it signifies the inflation of WoWs gold. It will be decent though, as it gives auctioneers like myself a new &quot;endgame.&quot; Besides that, I don't think the majority of players have anywhere near gold cap (max level, not including first day noobs).</div></div><hr />

I have 3 million and a guildie has 7 million. What this means is I will not have to keep sending gold to alts so I don't hit cap on my AH toon.

They do not behave like vehicles, so even if the turning is animated differently, it's not been made slower.</div></div><hr />

Now BMAH items will allow all these rich fuckers to actually win something without having to wake up at 2:30 am and hope to be the first to cap it.</div></div><hr />

When I saw this video I looked at my wife and said &quot;I bet that it takes less than 5 post reply's for someone to say something about flying being gated&quot;. Thanks for proving me right, only took 2.<br />

All this will do is make those 999,999.99 gold capped bids be 9,999,999.99. Nothing will change</div></div><hr />

Sorry there's a big difference between 1 mil and 10 mil in this game. Someone capping something for 10 mil means they probably won't be bidding on anything else for quite a long time. Nice try kiddo.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keile</div><div class="date">2016-04-28, 07:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is pointless. Flying should be usable in current content.<br />
<br />
They will be. They are going to have most of the achievements and such required to obtain flying when Legion hits. The rest will come shortly after.<br />
<br />
The whole thing will be similar to how you unlocked flight when Tanaan came out, only they are aiming to do it far sooner (I think they learned their lesson after the backlash they got during WoD). <br />
<br />
If I had to guess the remaining reps that will be required to unlock the flight will come with the first major patch.</div></div><hr />
