Apexis Crystal Bonus Event August 21 â€“ 24<br />
During the Sign of Apexis bonus event, you'll gain bonus Apexis Crystals from eligible creatures. Furthermore, completing the this-bonus event-only quest &quot;The Time to Strike (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/39033-the-time-to-strike)&quot; awards a sizable amount of Oil to fuel your Naval Missions, in addition to a big pile of Apexis Crystals.<br />
<br />
The point of picking up lots and lots of extra Apexis Crystals is, of course, to spend them! Here are some of the possibilities.<br />
<br />
For most players, spending Apexis Crystals on gear upgrades is a great way to improve your overall item level. There's something for every slot at item level 650, so if you've still got a low-level item in one or two slots, you're covered. Visit Ravenspeaker Thelnaas (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/96130-ravenspeaker-thelnaas) in Tanaan Jungle to buy armor for 5,000 Crystals apiece, a weapon for 10,000 Crystals, and Empowered Apexis Fragments for 20,000 Crystals. Empowered Apexis Fragment (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128225-empowered-apexis-fragment) are Battle.net Account-bound, and upgrade your Baleful gear from ilvl 650 to ilvl 695.<br />
<br />
Some nice new collectibles came along with Tanaan Jungle. You'll want to consider:<br />
<br />
<br />
Reins of the Corrupted Dreadwing (http://www.wowdb.com/items/123974-reins-of-the-corrupted-dreadwing) mount (150,000 Apexis Crystals)<br />
Rukhmar's Sacred Memory (http://www.wowdb.com/items/122283-rukhmars-sacred-memory) toy (50,000 Apexis Crystals)<br />
Blazing Firehawk (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128478-blazing-firehawk) pet (2,000 Apexis Crystals)<br />
Solar Priest Vayx (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/followers/582-solar-priest-vayx) follower (1,000 Apexis Crystals) <br />
<br />
<br />
The bonus weekend is underway, and runs through the end of the day on Monday, August 24.<br />
<br />
What are you aiming to buy with your extra crystals?<br />

Grove Warden Mount<br />
I really hope you're conscious that seeing this mount in the store freaks everyone out concerning legion rep rewards<br />

Story<br />
As a games designer, do you ever think you would let us, the heroes loose in an expansion!? we cant always win surely <br />
As a narrative device I think this is fun but you have to sell &quot;won every battle but lost the war.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/630877148031553537))<br />
Because it likely won't be fun for the player to just lose every fight. They still need to win a lot for a sense of satisfaction. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/630877250934583296))<br />
Consider Empire Strikes Back: the retreat from Hoth (spoiler) was a victory but not a victory like driving the Empire back. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/630877491024953345))<br />

Agree. I mean, idiotic mounts like a flying refridgerator in shop, fine. Niche product. Moose? Everyone's been wanting that since forever, and now we have to get it through a shop. They better release a non-glowy version as a rep mount in Legion, although you'd almost expect that with the new tauren tribe being half mooses themselves.</div></div><hr />

If they were designing unique mounts for store while giving players appropriate rep mounts in game, this wouldn't matter. But now they have taken away in game models and started selling them in store while awarding players re-skin models of old mounts from previous expansions with no logical connection to a faction. They did it with WoD big time and first store mounts we see from Legion are in game animals. This company is literally banking on dumbest or craziest fans to keep them floating. When Tom Chilton said Legion might be released after the movie, he wasn't talking about delays due to production. We are going to get another WoD. Since WoD has burned many, it will be hard to sell same crap to same people again. Hence the movie gambit.</div></div><hr />

I specifically said I did not farm them. They were a consequence of me doing other things<br />
<br />
You'll get at least 150k apexis crystals just by doing enough of the Tanaan dailies to satisfy the rep requirements of the flight achievement. Even more if you get the reps up to exalted. Add in all the other sources all over the place and you'll have more than you'll know what to do with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or you could be like myself and not spend the money to purchase these mounts from the store in the first place. People bitch about these mounts being in the store and Blizzard continuing to put them in there. Yet, if people simply did not purchase the damn things in the first place, they would be less likely to keep putting them into the store. <br />
<br />
I have so many mounts at this point, that the few that I actually still don't have after years of grinding for them feel far more special to me, than throwing $25 out the window on pixels, just so I can ride around on the mount for a couple weeks and then it never see the light of day again. As long a the demand is there Blizzard is still going to create these mount for the cash shop. If so many are so bent on this happening, then they need to stop priming the pump and buying these mounts from the shop. Sadly, that is never going to happen, so the people bitching about are completely wasting their time.<br />

I don't bother to go farm apexis anymore, between the shipyard and the garrison mission I get enough per week to buy at least 3 to 4 empowered's to upgrade the 675 item. I do the initial daily to get the oil barrel on every character to keep them supplied with a constant amount of them. I got everything done in Tanaan in the first two to three weeks of the patch doing and barely even step foot in there on an alt now. Garrison as a whole give enough crystals to keep the characters full of them weekly.</div></div><hr />

ON the original PTR version it was 500k simply for testing but went to 150k very early in testing as they found that was a number that people would reach around the time they would have the rep.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just DO hope that they've learned from WoD and won't just give us 15 recolors of the same mount type. There needs to be some moose mounts in-game as well, alongside other exciting NEW mount types.<br />

<br />
I think that mount is beautiful but..... For the life of me I can't work out why it can fly, it's totally unnecessary and makes it look pretty silly : /<br />
<br />
Because as much as they want to keep us grounded, they know that selling a ground only mount on the store would mean for it to only be worth a fraction of what they can charge if it flies. <br />
<br />
Simple as that really. And I don't think it looks silly at all, it's just running in the air like so many other mounts we already have. *shrug*</div></div><hr />

<br />
One is an RPG, one is a FPS, the other is a MOBA style game. <br />
FPS and MOBAs are meant for cosmetic micro-transactions to keep the game alive. MMO-RPG's, with a subscription service mind you, do not need these sales. It's unnecessary double-dipping. <br />
League and Overwatch have quick, pvp matches that don't need hours of commitment. So, yeah. You're right about Overwatch and League being casual and grindy, but not boring to me and many other players. However, that has nothing to do with my original comment. If you want to attack me personally, then fine, but at least make a point first.</div></div><hr />

I wouldnt have to save, 25 bucks is nothing. I refuse to be fleeced by a money hungry triple dipping company. They sell items that should be in game rewards and people with no sense buy em up and act like it has no effect. <br />
<br />
The dip shits who buy this are the reason why Laughing Skull had a wolf mount instead of a reaver and the SMV folks have a boar or w/e instead of the fey dragon.<br />
<br />
Its even better when you consider that mounts in FREE TO PLAY games are 1/2 the price. Yet the monekys just eat em up.</div></div><hr />

The saddle is just wrong. I was hoping the picture wasn't doing it justice, but seeing it in action makes it look worse. It's elevated off the back which would mean all of the rider's weight would be in one part of the back. That would be painful for the animal in real life. Then with how thin the anchor point is of the saddle, chances are it'd break eventually which would mean it would be driven into the back of the animal potentially leading to their death. The rocking back in forth is also wrong. If you did that in real life, you'd not only get motion sickness but you'd also fall off.<br />
<br />
Does anyone at Blizzard even ride animals? I'm sure they can find a ranch in California that lets them ride horses, cows, ostriches, and camels so they can get an actual feel for it rather than just watching a video or winging it. They might even be able to ride some other animals like an elephant. Blizzard's not even trying if they're failing this badly on something so basic. Blizzard failed really hard on the camel, too. You don't ride on the hump. The hump is just fat and can't really support the weight of a person. You actually ride behind the hump on a dromedary (which is what we got in game) or between them if it's a bactrian camel.<br />
<br />
While I'm aware WoW's look is cartoony, I draw the line when it comes to mounts. It's one thing to have shoulders so large they have their own gravitational pulls or weapons so large no real person can really wield it effectively, but mounts are another matter. Some people treat animals like crap as it is. Blizzard doing things like the saddle on that moose which is a walking disaster waiting to happen just makes me wonder if they're animal abusers, too. Blizzard's promoting animal cruelty. It's one thing to go after wild animals. You can take that similar to hunting. But a mount is our domesticated friend. They should be treated well and yet many aren't. Blizzard's continuously failing on simple things that can easily be found via a Google search if they refuse to actually take a work trip to go experience it for themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize we already paid for this mount, we paid with out monthly subs that gave them enough money to develop this and instead of adding this thing to a game as a reward, something to work for, they put it on a store, so stupid people could support their shady business practice. <br />
<br />
If this was a F2P MMO, then fine do what ever. But it's not, they are literally cutting interesting rewards from the game adding them to the store so you would buy it. <br />
<br />
And saying if you don't like it don't buy it is stupid. They are making re-skins so people would want buy these mount, so people would have a mount that look diffrent and cool. You are literally saying that you want to be a shill for blizz.<br />
<br />
Also these mount definetly don't cost 20 euros the only reason they are keeping the price high is because Whales would feel special in the world with their friends.</div></div><hr />

You.. do realize that for you to play for free, someone else paid your 13 euros + 7 extra euros, right?<br />

While you are not paying Real Money, someone else is. <br />
So those &quot;13 euros&quot; that the poster mentioned are still very much present, even if you pay via In-game gold.</div></div><hr />

there's alot of cool mounts in-game also and you need to work your ass off to get them, having re-skinned mounts been going on since 4ever and no one talked anything about it in the past, your precious WOTLK has so fucking re-skinned mounts and no one talked shit about it, why now? you got bored? or you woke up too late, yes we did already pay for it and yes its not a F2P game but still, having something extra been going on since 4ever also. imagine your self in a gym that you have to pay for your locker, you want a locker you pay for it with the sub you dont want one, well no 1 slapped your hand for that.

WoW charges a subscription fee; these things should be in the game somewhere, achievable by in-game means. It doesn't make me angry but it makes me less inclined to give them my money. Warlords was a steaming pile of poop that generated a loooot of bad PR/bad feelings in the consumer base. Legions has a really really deep pit to climb out of, and right now Blizzard should be focused on showing us everything cool that's in the expansion (since they've pretty much written Warlords off entirely).</div></div><hr />

What happened, tell me, to exciting mounts that were rewarded in game? Buy what you want, fine. Enjoy it, fine. But defending this business move? That's what makes you sheep. The shop gets new models, the in game rewards get MK Pallet-swap ninjas. If that doesn't make sense, allow me to illustrate:<br />

Re-skinned mount is not the problem, the problem is the unique model are not in the game to be achieved they are there to be bought. If they had re-skin in the store I don't think people would really give a fuck. Also, none talked about Celestial steed? I don't know when you joined the game, but there was a huge uproar from the community for this double dipping business practice when it just started, making some people even quit wow.The only diffrence now is that the community is more vocal then ever about this problem. As for the locker thing, I wouldn't join a gym with this shady practice as well. You might have some mount to achieve for me personally the only mounts to achieve I have left is some invasion boars, old raid (which is not a hard way to achieve it's just fucking luck, and even with that I only have 2 mounts I need in total from old raids). Even getting TLPD wasn't a hard fucking way to obtain, it was: who was lucky enough to have it spawn on 1 out of 4 spawn points with 25% of it spawning instead of vyragosa, and having the quickest trigger fingers out of the 5 other people camping near you + all the CRZ shit. Laughing skull rewards you with a wolf instead of their reaver mount which is now nicely sitting in the store and which they promote in gorground. So yes they are taking out unique models, placing a shitty re-skin and think that they deserve 25 bucks from a mount they made for WoD and locket off.</div></div><hr />

But guys, relax and breathe. I understand the need to vent, but no one in a position of authority will listen when you swear like a wounded pirate. All you're doing is weakening your position and making yourselves look foolish.<br />
<br />
As for the other guys? C'mon. Everyone here loves this game. Sure, you're ok with the cash shop and others aren't. We'll all agree to move on and give reasonable feedback. I know you guys are on side, and get sick of being shouted down by people on the other side, but all that'll happen is Blizzard will see two factions of whiny, shouty, barely coherent cry babies who'll still buy their games and pay for their services.<br />
<br />
If you want to make changes? Fine!<br />
Coherency, politeness and well reasoned argument.<br />
<br />
Otherwise it's internet Tantrum Throwing on Forum.<br />
<br />
My 2c, of courseâ€¦</div></div><hr />

Instead of complaining don't buy Starbucks, Rockstars or Monsters for a couple of days and you will have enough for the mount. I think the problem with many is that your not adults, so mom and dad say no and that's what makes you mad! Don't get mad at me or anyone else who works and saves the money for anything in the store. I am sure all those same people crying about the store also cry about the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket. Yeah I can save and get that too. Buying in the store doesn't ruin my game or anyone I know. It's a free choice. I can decide what, if anything, I want to purchase. It's not required for the game. I understand you feel disappointment but there are plenty of in game disappointments like the Fel Wolf mount I will never get because I only raid LFR and you can only get it on normal and above. Am I disappointed, sure but I won't rage quit over it or scream obscenities at Blizz for it.</div></div><hr />

You do realize the problem isn't that they sell mounts, it is that every decent model ends up on the blizzard store while the mounts we are offered in game tends to be the same boar recolored 5 times.</div></div><hr />

One can always start a change by not buying anything from in-game store.</div></div><hr />
