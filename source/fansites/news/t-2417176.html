Upcoming PvP Hotfixes (8/1)<br />
The following hotfixes have been applied to beta, and will be added to the live game later this week. We continue to work on other adjustments, such as the damage and healing output of other specs including Discipline, Retribution, and Balance. Those changes are going to take a little longer than the following hotfixes, but we wanted to get these in your hands for testing while playing on beta.<br />
<br />
We appreciate all the feedback that has been generated from testing out the combination of Azerite Traits, Talents, Enchants, and Gearing options found on Gladiator's Sanctum.<br />
<br />
In these hotfixes, we've targeted specs that are currently over-performing in certain PvP situations. Instead of reducing the overall damage that specializations such as Assassination Rogues and Marksmanship Hunters deal in PvP, we've chosen to reduce some of the talents and abilities that can contribute to high damage burst windows.<br />
<br />
Changes to specializations in Battle for Azeroth have increased the power of specific PvP Talents. Restoration Druids in particular gained a large increase to Lifebloom in Battle for Azeroth, so we have in turn reduced the overall power of Focused Growth.<br />
<br />
Racial Abilities<br />
<br />
Light's Judgment deals 50% less damage when engaged in combat with enemy players. (was a 60% reduction in 7.3.5) Light's Reckoning deals 50% less damage when engaged in combat with enemy players. (was a 60% reduction in 7.3.5)<br />

<br />
Sin rogues damage did not come from their skills it comes from their mastery. They approached this in the wrong manor they should have gone after the mastery not the skills.<br />
<br />
On BFA beta this is what every rogues does now: Stack mastery/versatility to insane values to achieve the type of damage displayed on the beta because that is just how strong the mastery alone is.</div></div><hr />

I'm curious to see what the Retribution nerfs are going to be like, since that spec still is as OP, if not more, as Assassination was.<br />
<br />
Anyway, these nerfs can seem like a little too much, but it's mainly because Retribution, Balance and Discipline are still completely broken. Once these three specs get nerfed, things will be more balanced overall and Assassination shouldn't look so bad.</div></div><hr />

Rogues were killing people in their opener, and you think a 10% damage reduction on some abilities will render you useless? We all knew rogues had it coming. If you can't play it without being broken, I suggest finding a different class.<br />
<br />
I knew death knight nerf was coming. I think 50% damage reduction on wandering plague is a bit harsh. And I know I will never pick necrotic strike for a pvp talent now. But the 25% dmg reduction on virulent plague and plague explosion is OK.</div></div><hr />

They are ridiculously op atm, bgs are 50% rogues. I've got a decently geared rogue and I've not been scared of 3v1 fights, as I can usually win them atm. Rogues will be just fine even after this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues were killing people in their opener, and you think a 10% damage reduction on some abilities will render you useless? We all knew rogues had it coming. If you can't play it without being broken, I suggest finding a different class.<br />
<br />
I knew death knight nerf was coming. I think 50% damage reduction on wandering plague is a bit harsh. And I know I will never pick necrotic strike for a pvp talent now. But the 25% dmg reduction on virulent plague and plague explosion is OK.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually if you average out all the percentages lost just in Assassination it’s a 26% loss in overall damage.</div></div><hr />

Buffs nerfs means shit. They have always been insanely good and will continue to be so. <br />
<br />
But atleast the fotm-baddies left there rogues:)<br />
<br />
Was never a case of tier 1 rubbish was more of a case of I bored of being in the cycle of buff/nerf 1 minute a stupidly OP god and the next struggling versus Y due to a change that then got hotfixed weeks later (talking TBC remember), I'd rather plod along with minimal changes in the grander scheme of things.<br />

Good luck levelling in &quot;peace&quot; with warmode on if pvp changes aren't made now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no peace in warmode...that is a 10% bonus for horde only. Every time i put it on and go around i don't see any alliance. From WQs on broken isle, to Argus...to the 5 man dungeon in ulumn when mount farming. Horde Horde Horde and more Horde. <br />
<br />
This was a mistake. I am not saying these things were not op...but this just adds more work for 120. There will be buffs to these classes/specs @120....for sure some of them will not be under-performing.</div></div><hr />

So many bug fixes almost daily, and it has been a few weeks already since release! Didn't they test those things out in beta? Maybe they are inviting wrong people to beta that only do latest content and not people like me who try older content instead. :D</div></div><hr />

Read the first paragraph of the patch notes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait.. what?<br />
<br />
Buffs and nerfs has never really mattered overall for rogues. They have ALWAYS been incredibly good in all pvp-scenarior. Be it duells, 2v2, 3v3, 5v5, battlegrounds.<br />
I can count on 1 hand seasons from tbc where rogues were bad in pvp. that says alot. They have been incredibly great for 99% of their pvp-existence.<br />
<br />
And to read forum posts saying &quot;well rogue is shit again. wow... thanks blizz!&quot; is just so inredibly frustrating because its either a troll or a case of being a complete idiot.<br />
<br />
no offence!<br />
<br />
Rogues are great, they have always been great and will always be great still at 120.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how you didn't read the first paragraph. Classic.</div></div><hr />

Good! It will still be very viable. I've seen plenty of players being killed during a cheap shot opener. Players should not die from a cheap shot, kidney shot combo. Take a good amount of damage? Yes. Die? No.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haidaes</div><div class="date">2018-08-03, 06:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If they wanted to nerf something they should have probably started with the most aggregious offenders first.. I mean it takes between 4 and 8 people to kill a discipline priest. And rets can two shot some people as well. Going after Neurotic (sic!) Strike was oddly high on their priority. :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alex1312</div><div class="date">2018-08-03, 06:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">JESUS CHRIST!! The first good thing done by blizzard after a looong looong time! Rogues and hunters needed a huge nerf and that's perfect! Not sure about dks nerf :/ i agree they had a bit too much dmg but this nerf is a bit overkill. Now im waiting to see ret and bala nerf, hope they got something hard and after ret nerf, hope for a demo buff, at least 20% dmg increased.</div></div><hr />
