World of Warcraft Turns 5, Warcraft Turns 15<br />
Over the past 15 years, a lot has changed in Azeroth. Valiant heroes have travelled the length and breadth of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms, taken wing in Outland to free the Black Temple from Illidan's clutches, and set sail for Northrend to battle the mighty Lich King. Whether you've been part of the adventure from the beginning or are just getting started now, we're glad to have you with us for the five-year anniversary of World of Warcraft and the 15-year anniversary of the Warcraft series.<br />
<br />
To commemorate these milestones, we've just launched the Warcraft anniversary website. There you’ll find video interviews featuring personal anecdotes from some of the shapers of Warcraft, as well as the Battlecry Mosaic where you can show off your faction pride. Visit the anniversary site now!<br />

<br />
That being said, listening to them reminisce and discuss their raiding experience, and the swells of pride when they first downed the difficult content, it made me a little sad that I have not yet had that experience. I am late to the game, having only tanked through SSC in BC before WotLK dropped, and having cleared all of the content up to 25 ToGC (still workin on Anub), I just wish there were something epic feeling I could experience first hand. <br />
<br />
I know, the whole Casual vs Elite argument is always harsh, and it is not my intention to derail discussion, but it is a little disheartening knowing there is a chance I will never have the feeling of pride they received from downing Onyxia, or banging their heads against Molten Core only to finally defeat Ragnaros and the feelings of pride and camaraderie amongst Guild Mates.<br />

Having raided in vanilla, it really was epic compared to today. But there was a huge downside to this - you had to commit, and you had to do it for real. Raiding was something you either dedicated to or didn't do at all back then. Getting into a raiding guild was an epic achievement itself, not to mention that first time you joined the raid to MC or Onyxia or later BWL, seeing gear people had that once you could only dream of. And then you raided every day, of every week, of every month. If you weren't there for a couple times in a row, gkick and fuck you. There was no room for excuses, you got to respect the rules and respect the guild mates as there was 39 other people there. Not many more as it's extremely hard to gear up for encounters like that when only two were available. Then came BWL, ZG, then AQ, it got easier but still was epic. You were raiding with same people every day and true friendships were built. You learned to recognize people and people learned to recognize you for your dedication and skill. <br />
<br />
Epic gear back then was epic and either you grinded PvP for 18h a day, 7 days a week for a couple of months or you raided, every day, getting tiny amounts of DKP for each raid and when an item for you dropped, once in a month or two, or three, someone else got it because they had more DKP than you did. I yelled so hard when I finally got my Halo of Transcendence, thus completing T2 set, half of the dorm I used to live in heard me. There were like 50 people on my server who had full T2 and I became one of them.<br />
<br />
Now, everyone has epics. If you're 80 and you got a blue item, you either play once a week for an hour or something's really wrong with you. Everyone raids like there's no tomorrow. Raiding guilds are overcrowded with people. And although I miss the vanilla times, I think it's better now. Back then, only a small percentage of players, with no life at all (I was one of them), had access to some of the content that everyone paid equally for. <br />
<br />
Having said all that, it's hard to not miss those times but it's also hard not to miss the wasted time, for a God damned game. We all (well, most of us) learned to enjoy the game but the price for that epic feeling you describe was huge back then and a lot of us paid for it. Lots of people became addicted, lots of people's lives were ruined. I for one almost got kicked out of university and would probably ruin my life if I haven't gotten a job I enjoyed so much and still do.<br />
<br />
And, more on topic - damn, I feel old. 15 years of Warcraft, I remember playing Warcraft 1 and then Warcraft 2 over serial cable with my neighbor. Damn. Oh, and wall of text crits you ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been playing WoW since July 2006. It was an impulse buy when I was at a Wal-Mart late one night. I knew a friend that played and had heard good things so I decided to give it a shot. I logged about 13 days /played in the next 30 days and I've been hooked every since.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onisuofdreams</div><div class="date">2009-11-24, 07:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hearing the stories in the interviews is very exciting for me and I just wanna tell about my favorite Warcraft experience as well.<br />
<br />
I had played each Warcraft game before it came out, but my moments were actually in Burning Crusade. I had two that stuck out in my mind. They were in the guild &quot;Depth&quot;. We basically were a large group that had split from another guild and slowly worked our way through the tiers. We were a pretty tight knit group and that stands out to me more than ever when we defeated Vashj, which we had done before, but the healing mace finally dropped. I was still using the epic BoE world drop, so my weapon was way behind, but my DKP was also behind many other healers. It would have been an upgrade for everyone, but they all passed to me because I had been so unlucky with drops. It really made me feel like I could call these people, who I had never seen the faces of, good friends.<br />
<br />
My most epic feeling came from fighting Kael'thas at the end of Tempest Keep. We had been trying to beat him for weeks and we just couldn't get past phase 4. Our coordination was off and all sorts of problems came up. Finally, one night close to when Black Temple and Hyjal attunements were removed, we were doing I think one more night of attempts before we were going to leave it behind us. During one of the attempts, we got to phase 4, and once again, things started to go wrong. The main tank died early on that phase and the off-tank took his place. We battle rezzed the main tank, but he died again, soon after the off-tank. Then a druid in DPS gear popped into Bear form and started tanking Kael just for the heck of it and we were somehow able to keep him alive. Finally we hit phase 5, with this dps druid tanking and the healers, (including myself) were just pouring everything we could to keep him alive. I remember the screaming on vent and how intense it was. It was the furthest we had ever gotten and both our tanks were dead.</div></div><hr />

It's not just a game, it's part of my life, of my childhood. I've been playing warcraft games for over 8 years and before that i was playing other Blizzard games. I started to draw, because i was inspired by all the artworks, ingame, on the site, the trading card games. I wasn't interested in fantasy before warcraft, now im reading a lot of different books, not only fantasy ones. This franchise really influenced my whole life. If i didn't start to play warcraft, maybe now i would be completely different person. Maybe better, maybe worst, this is something i don't know, but i don't regret for any second spend in the game. <br />

I haven't watched the video yet because I'm at work but I saw somebody mention Crusader Bridenbrad earlier so I assume that's what you're referring to. <br />

A Tale of Valor http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=13068 is the first part of the chain.<br />

To unlock it you have to establish Crusader Pinnacle which itself requires first doing some quest from the Argent Vanguard and Father Gustav located a bit outside Argent Vanguard itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and now i want to write an answer to dejna encores post...you are so right with your point of view while i was reading your post i felt vendicated in everything you wrote about vanilla raiding and yes its true it was an already an epic feeling to only join a well organised raidguild me too played the whole content from the old vanilla group instances trough all the raidinstances and yes i am also feeling very adicted to these old times because it was hard and exhausting to step forward in the content and whenever i recived an epic item it was like cristmas and brithday together because like you wrote one or rarely two items a month was much in those days i still remember the yelling and shouting and happieness in the ts when sulfuras smashed on the ground the first time it was a sooo overwelming feeling after i belive 5-7 months of raiding on mc i dont remember the exact time wich we spent but that comes close to the truth and when our first maintank got his thunderfury (legendary tank weapon out of mc and bwl for those who never had the chance to play the old wow) we have been so proud of our selfes its really hard to discribe that but you can say that the more time you spend on a task to forfill it the happier you are when you finally solve it<br />
<br />

I distinctly remember picking up the Original Warcraft when it first hit the shelves. Been a Blizzard fan ever since too, even thought they do piss me off from time to time, they're a monster of a gaming company and I can't wait to see what they've in store for future games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That being said, listening to them reminisce and discuss their raiding experience, and the swells of pride when they first downed the difficult content, it made me a little sad that I have not yet had that experience. I am late to the game, having only tanked through SSC in BC before WotLK dropped, and having cleared all of the content up to 25 ToGC (still workin on Anub), I just wish there were something epic feeling I could experience first hand. <br />
<br />
I know, the whole Casual vs Elite argument is always harsh, and it is not my intention to derail discussion, but it is a little disheartening knowing there is a chance I will never have the feeling of pride they received from downing Onyxia, or banging their heads against Molten Core only to finally defeat Ragnaros and the feelings of pride and camaraderie amongst Guild Mates.<br />
<br />
That being said, happy birthday Warcraft!<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree, i can't imagine doing all that with that kind of gear they got, and being at lvl 60, that must of been such a relief downing those bosses. but i think wow has changed their views, with the lfg thing its good for pugs, but it takes away the social part and becoming a guild in WoW, or running stuff with friends. i remember playing Vanilla wow but i didn't make it that far in the game because of my gateway laptop(never buy a gateway, or do they even exist?), but back then, people were more friendly and actually talk during a raid. <br />
<br />
i miss the old wow :\</div></div><hr />

I dunno about you, but I've never found a guild of people I like and have fun with more than my current guild.<br />
<br />
We're not hardcore at all though, we tried out ToGC 10 this weekend, went terrible due to a lack of dps, but when we were about to wipe, instead of just giving up and complaining, someone would yell out &quot;I GOTS THIS!&quot; and taunt one of the worms or pop evasion for laughs.<br />
<br />
There's still friendly people out there, at least in the casual guilds. XD</div></div><hr />

<br />
This gaming franchise has been a part of almost all of my life and has provided me with more entertainment than anything else. Keep up the amazing work blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I gotta admit that my favorite moment raiding was back in TBC, downing Kael'Thas... guild I was in was struggling with Kael and I had a feeling we will disband because all of the wipes (Vashj and Kael were, as we all remember, guild breakers) and many ppl leaving us... we downed him with few recruits who didn't have the gear for the fight. Later on we took MH and BT and it wasn't as hard as Kael.<br />
<br />
As of my favorite zone in wow - Ashenvale. I know many ppl don't like the zone because it's really large and hard to quest in it without a mount but I always loved the NE lore and found zone really great... and the music there, wow! so enchanting in a way and almost a bit scary :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eucep</div><div class="date">2009-11-24, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, feeling old too here. I was 15 when Warcraft 1 came to be, I just got my pc and it was one of the first games I got after Dune 2. I had a hacked copy sadly as the original game, just wasn't available here (as were most games at that point in time). But I really loved playing it. I remember then seeing the first images of Warcraft 2 and going ape at the SVGA graphics of the game. I told my palls back then that it would be an awesome game and I wasn't proven wrong. Warcraft 3 comming out while we were still playing Starcraft really hurt my education though, I'm sure of it.<br />
<br />
When WoW was announced, me and my friends went to explore the MMO thingy by playing Horizons. We tried it, had a chat and concluded our social lives were doomed. We weren't proven wrong.<br />
<br />
Now, 5 and 15 years later. I'm still hooked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then he said in a girly voice then a couple 100 allys screamed &quot;FOR GNOMERGAN!&quot; <br />

Nice, cool background.<br />
I edited into a background for all the Zune mp3 player users. Looks pretty wicked.<br />
All the text and selections fit neatly to the left without the image obscuring them<br />
The resolution of the image is the Zune standard background size.<br />
