For the heroes of Azeroth, the Broken Shore represents pain, sorrow . . . and an opportunity for vengeance. It is the source of the Burning Legion’s seemingly unending incursion, and an ever-present reminder of the defeat suffered at their hands by both the Horde and the Alliance. But now it’s time to return to where the invasion began—this time as a more prepared force. <br />
<br />
Assault on the Broken Shore<br />
Hospitality isn’t the Legion’s strong suit, so don’t expect them to roll out the welcome mat for Azeroth’s forces. You’re going to need to break through their defenses, clear the beach, and establish a foothold for your base. Similar to the launch of World of Warcraft: Legion, if you’ve max level, Khadgar will have a quest for you which will begin a solo scenario on the Broken Shore.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
You and your forces will progress through a series of stages as you press the attack against the Burning Legion. This culminates in the infiltration of one of the Legion’s ships to face the dreadlord Mephistroth — this won’t be the last you’ll see of him however.<br />
<br />
Once complete, you’ll arrive at Deliverance Point. This base of operations will serve as a sanctuary for members of all Class Orders as they begin working on a new campaign on the Broken Shore alongside the Armies of Legionfall.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Deliverance Point and Securing the Broken Shore<br />
Your first foray into the Broken Shore will involve getting a few things established and learning more about these fel-befouled lands. Evidence remains of a once shining elven civilization, and crumbling structures are all that bear witness to what once was. Even the statues have been touched by the corruption of the Legion.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/thumb/bsp03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/bsp03.jpg) <br />
<br />
As you progress through the Broken Shore, you’ll undertake a variety of new World Quests for rewards and continue the evolution of your Artifact weapon.<br />
<br />
Completing World Quests within the Broken Shore will also provide Legionfall War Supplies and reputation with the Armies of Legionfall. They can also be obtained from other sources such as rare Elites found around the island. Legionfall War Supplies are essential for contributing to the construction of powerful buildings within Deliverance Point, which will provide additional benefits for those working their way through the Broken Shore.<br />
<br />
There’s plenty to do here and more than enough demons to keep everyone on their guard.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/thumb/bsp04.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/bsp04.jpg) <br />
<br />
Constructing Defenses<br />
You can contribute to the construction of three different buildings by accessing the Legionfall Construction Table. The first time a building is established, a brief scene plays and a quest becomes available that grants the buffs associated with the building. Each building provides access to different benefits, and there are a variety of extra bonuses each building has a chance to provide. Make sure you pay close attention to them—these additional bonuses could sway your choice of which to donate to. Contributions toward each building are accumulated across your game region, so choose wisely.<br />
<br />
Constructing each building requires a steady influx of Legionfall War Supplies. Once constructed, the building is available for 3 days, during which players can reap the benefits the building provides. The building will come under under attack on the last of those days, after which it is destroyed and must be rebuilt. You’ll then need to wait a cooldown period of one day before you can contribute again to rebuild.<br />
<br />
Here are the buildings that can be constructed:<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/thumb/bsp05.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/bsp05.jpg) <br />
<br />
<br />
Mage Tower<br />
Harness arcane energies to move Legionfall forces quickly throughout the Broken Isles and uncover challenging agents of the Legion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Benefits Include: Fel Treasures, which provides access to Artifact Challenges, bonus treasure spawns, and city portals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here’s an example of just one type of buff that could be provided when this building is constructed:<br />
<br />
<br />
Knowledgeable: When you loot an item which grants Artifact Power in a raid or dungeon, there’s a chance you will receive a bonus Artifact Power item. <br />
<br />
<br />
Command Center<br />
A fortified base of operations for Order Hall leaders to gather together and plan their attacks across the Broken Shore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Benefits Include: Forces of the Order, which provides access to dungeon World Quests, the ability to call in Legionfall Reinforcements, and a Challenge Mission.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here’s an example of just one type of buff that could be provided when this building is constructed:<br />
<br />
<br />
War Effort: When earning Legionfall War Supplies, you have a chance to get bonus Legionfall War Supplies. <br />
<br />
<br />
You’ll also have access to your Class Order Command Map here, so you can send your Followers on missions without having to travel back to your Class Hall.<br />
<br />
Nether Disruptor<br />
Harness arcane energies to move Legionfall forces quickly throughout the Broken Isles and uncover challenging agents of the Legion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Benefits Include: Epic Hunter, which provides you with access to world bosses, Unstable Nether Portals, and Armorcrafter Commendations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here’s an example of just one type of buff that could be provided when this building is constructed:<br />
<br />
Reinforced Reins: Allows you to interact with objects while mounted.<br />
<br />
Continuing Your Class Hall Quest Line<br />
<br />
Where the factions failed, the Class Orders are determined to succeed, and now you have the weapons at hand to make it happen. Each class can continue their Class Order Campaign on the Broken Shore and continue unlocking the power of their Artifact weapon.<br />
<br />
For those who are at Artifact Knowledge level 25, you cann unlock Knowledge level 26 and beyond.<br />
<br />
For those not at Knowledge level 25, don’t worry. You’ll be led to Dalaran to get a boost up. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/thumb/bsp06.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/bsp06.jpg) <br />
<br />
If you’ve purchased all 35 ranks of your Artifact weapon for at least one specialization, a new quest to continue your journey will appear. After a short series of quests, you’ll unlock access to four new traits for your Artifact weapon.<br />
<br />
If you haven’t opened all 35 ranks of your available traits, a quest will become available so you can complete that before moving on.<br />
<br />
As with the beginning of the expansion, you’ll progress your Class Order quest line over time as you play the Broken Shore experience. You’ll also gain one new Follower a few weeks in and can take part in some new class-specific World Quests on the Broken Shore. In some cases, these World Quests will have you aiding other classes along the way.<br />
<br />
Under the Glow of the Sentinax<br />
Looming high above the island is the Burning Legion’s command ship, the Sentinax. Fighting creatures within its shadow, will allow you to loot a beacon from these creatures that can be used to command the ship to open portals. These portals will produce more Legion adversaries for you to take on. Each level provides new opportunities to get a higher-level beacon. These higher-level portals in turn allow access to even more dangerous foes.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/thumb/bsp07.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/march/bsp07.jpg) <br />
<br />
Open enough portals and overcome enough adversaries and you’ll eventually gain access to a raid boss for you and some friends to take on. It goes without saying—but we’ll say it anyway—this is a great way to amass Nethershards.<br />
<br />
Nethershards are a useful currency for purchasing catch-up gear from the vendors Warmage Kath'leen and Thaumaterge Vashreen in Deliverance Point. These can also be used to purchase chances for higher item level gear as well. We hope you have your good dice ready for those upgrades!<br />
<br />
Don’t worry about being confined the shadow of the Sentinax any time you want to collect Nethershards. You’ll also gain them through a variety of other activities and sources as you adventure on the Broken Shore. <br />
<br />
Cathedral of Eternal Night<br />
Once you complete the opening Scenario and first quests on the Broken Shore, you’ll gain access to the new dungeon, Cathedral of Eternal Night. Khadgar will have a quest that will send you into its upper reaches, where you’ll face Mephistroth once more. Venturing into the cathedral isn’t required to progress through the Broken Shore—but if you want another shot at Mephistroth, this is your chance.<br />
<br />
While there’s plenty to do on the Broken Shore, don’t be surprised when something like Demon Assaults on the Broken Isles pulls you away.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, your efforts on the Broken Shore will lead to a confrontation unlike any other at the Tomb of Sargeras. With powerful Artifact weapons and the Pillars of Creation at hand, victory over the Burning Legion and Kil’jaeden is nearly assured.<br />
<br />

Doubt that long since they already gave the PvP season end warning<br />
<br />
and inb4 someone says &quot;seasons not linked to patches anymore&quot;<br />
<br />
season 3 starts right after season 2 ends, season 3 uses 7.2 assests, season 3 cannot start without 7.2.<br />

No. You just open up the new options, get the current final trait as a buildin buff and get everything above 35 points refunded to spend on the new traits.</div></div><hr />

The quests unlock the new traits where you still have to farm AP to fill it all out. You will have some AP refunded to you from the ones you spent on the 4th dragon but its not enough to cap it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, and Argus around 18th.<br />
<br />
But more seriously, raids are not tied to patches so closely anymore. Probably small 7.2.5 (around June I guess) will have class changes and tuning preparation for Tomb raid.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know for sure, but S3 start few hours after S2 end, right?</div></div><hr />

Yea, the post says as much, &quot;Attention Arena and Battleground competitors! Legion PvP Season 2 is coming to a close soon. Once ended, the battle will begin again a few hours after, when Legion PvP Season 3 begins!&quot;<br />

But tomb probably will be close to may/june</div></div><hr />

Nope. S3 will start hours after S2 ends. The raid will probably not be open until early June if they want to have Nighthold last for 5 months.</div></div><hr />

It's almost as if they want the buildings to be something that is consistent.

The buildings are temporary and need to be constantly rebuilt? That's fucking stupid and is just Blizzard making us waste resources. People have been complaining about the grind and instead of fixing it, they introduce more grinds. Their new design team is atrocious.<br />
The buildings are maintained by the entire server's population, not individual players. You just contribute, like the War Effort back in the day.</div></div><hr />

Since it was mentioned that there will be a quest if you don't have 35. I hope I am reading this right. will be great for alts. Seems like it is a way of resetting the start of the grind!!</div></div><hr />

As far as i understand it, you get free 35 points on your offspec weapons, IF you have one weapon maxed at 35 traits. Alts with no 35 traits don't get a free ride to those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also some buildings providing a bonus that provides a chance to get X...<br />
<br />
Everything will soon be RNG. <br />

WoW is an MMORNG.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;If you’ve purchased all 35 ranks of your Artifact weapon for at least one specialization, a new quest to continue your journey will appear. After a short series of quests, you’ll unlock access to four new traits for your Artifact weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you haven’t opened all 35 ranks of your available traits, a quest will become available so you can complete that before moving on.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is nothing about alt spec artifact only boost. <br />
<br />
<br />
Most likely they want to magnet in new people and those who fell behind in the meantime due unsubbing, making AK25 and 35 traits a new starting point instead of AK0 and 0 traits. It is understandable, when a new player realizes that he has to farm a gazillion years even with the shorter AK research times to get anywhere close to any endgame content it can be a huge turnoff.</div></div><hr />

So, i will have to do the same quest 3 times for my 3 spec weapons? (2 for DH, 4 for Druids). The quests might be like the initial artifact acquisition, where every class had different spec quests, but those quests were shared between classes. Not sure, cba with PTR when stuff has to be done on live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ahhh i figured either the next week, or right after<br />
50/50 shot</div></div><hr />

Yes, 7.1.5, that's the minor non impactful shit I mentioned in my post<br />
<br />
<br />
Plenty of people are not done with NH. Theres no 10 man raid.<br />
<br />
I meant to say 10 BOSS raid, my bad. And if you think &lt;1% of the player base aka mythic raiders are &quot;plenty of players&quot; then you're pretty delusional.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Nighthold should've launched when the game launched or at least at the same time EN got released. Staggering content does not make it more content. <br />
<br />
The last true patch was 7.1. Since then we got some classtweaks, 1 day a year holidays and MoP timewalking. And A 10 BOSS raid that should've launched before 7.1 even hit the game. They even could have delayed 7.1 a bit more if they did that.<br />
<br />
I get that you all like the game. I do too. But it does not stop me from critisizing it. You are all trying to make it like Blizzard is doing its job better now with wow with the content releases.<br />
But if you look at the facts, you can see that we haven't gotten more content. The content we get now is distributed better, instead of getting it all at once, we're now getting small things on a more &quot;frequent&quot; basis.<br />
I would even argue to say that we've gotten less content added than before.<br />
<br />
Please guys don't fall for this illusion. <br />
<br />
MORE FREQUENT CONTENT=/= MORE CONTENT</div></div><hr />

It would not be a good idea to release two raids at the same time. And yes, Blizzard is doing its job with releasing content much better now than before. And your &quot;facts&quot; are only your opinion, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

What &quot;should've&quot; by your opinion, does not make it a fact as you stated it in your previous comment. Thanks for apologising for your mistake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never put any of my opinions as a fact. If I did feel free to point it out. <br />
Although I don't want to spend time discussing on use of words because people can't read. It happens almost every discussion I get involved in.</div></div><hr />
