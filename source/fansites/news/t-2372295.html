havent you learned by now that the concept of legion is to leave the classes that are op and screw the ones that arent,<br />

kinda annoyed about the druid balance changes, Resto pvp for me from now on i guess.</div></div><hr />

Prot pallies needed tuning, they were broken in arena. Blood dks do that much damage from Death Chains and arent good in arena, aff locks are fine theyre squishy.<br />

Healing is fine, why would you nerf healing when most healers average 260k-300k sustained while most dps do 200k average? Be happy thats the only thing that happend to elly, theyre ridiculous rn.</div></div><hr />

They do changes that affects pve all the time. <br />

Wouldn't really call them fixing the bugs their patches caused meaningful class/balancing changes but ok.</div></div><hr />

No different from the PvP changes really, neither PvE or PvP gets meaningful changes for the most part.</div></div><hr />

I wondered about that, but let's be suspicious, they might have something worse for us in the backhand!</div></div><hr />

And you've come to this conclusion based on what? There is one high ranked prot paladin in NA and they are like 93rd or something.</div></div><hr />

Open your eyes!<br />
<br />
look at Noxxic max dps <br />
<br />
The differences between the last one and the first one is around 40% he/she does less dmg, this has nothing to do with balance or a will to balance classes.<br />
You can call it poor work work on a useless addon</div></div><hr />

I agree. Prot is really OP.</div></div><hr />
