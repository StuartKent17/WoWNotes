WoW Esports at BlizzCon 2019<br />
With the BlizzCon 2019 announcement, we wanted to give more details about the WoW esports on offer in Anaheim, California this fall. BlizzCon this year will have two days of WoW esports celebrations, with the Arena World Championship (AWC) Global Finals and Mythic Dungeon International (MDI) Global Finals sharing the World of Warcraft stage during both days of the event.<br />
<br />
Arena World Championship (AWC) Global Finals<br />
The AWC Global Finals will host eight teams at BlizzCon: five from North America/Europe, one from China, one from Asia-Pacific, and one from Latin America, all of whom will battle in a double-elimination bracket. In its 12th year and with more seasonal Cups than ever before, the AWC Global Finals are sure to deliver as new and veteran players alike fight for the championship.<br />
<br />

<br />
Mythic Dungeon International (MDI) Global Finals<br />
The finale of the MDI will feature the top two teams from the Spring Season LAN and the top two point-earning teams from each division (based on yearly points) flying to California to race live and in person. These six teams will compete in a double-elimination bracket for the title of 2019 MDI Global Finals champions and their share of the prize pool. After making the transition in 2019 from an invitational series to a year-long, international program, our dungeon-runners will display peak performance on the biggest WoW esports stage in the world.<br />
<br />

<br />
The prize pools for the AWC and MDI will include contributions from the sales of the Transmorpher Beacon and Lion’s Pride/Horde’s Might Fireworks toys. These contributions will be split down the middle, adding an equal amount of money to both prize pools. All your support for our gladiators and racers so far has been phenomenal, and we will provide an update on the final prize pools as we get closer to November.<br />

No the dps requirement tuning was just insane so this is to counteract that. This is just a big nerf to an overtuned fight.</div></div><hr />

Sorry what? I think you’re thinking about promises of power. Power overwhelming is from when an artifact is activated twice by a single boss giving them a damage buff that’ll wipe the raid.</div></div><hr />

I think you are mixing up a spell here now.<br />
<br />
Each relic should only be used by each boss once, because if an individual boss uses a particular relic more than once they will gain a 300% damage increase buff: Power Overwhelming. Which is now buffed to 1000% Instawiping the group if it takes the same relic twice</div></div><hr />

Exorsus exploited the first boss with pet tanks, basically making the caster not do anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that's not an exploit, that's clever use of game mechanics, all of the actions taken worked exactly as supposed to so there was no glitch/bug at play.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mashanerz</div><div class="date">2019-04-26, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So was Power Overwhelming buffed because a guild exploited (or rather was able to not wipe using the same relic twice) and killed the Cabal or because blizzard saw guilds trying to avoid one and looked to be coming close?<br />
<br />
Only 6 guilds have killed Cabal atm, Pieces, Limit, vodkaz, Method, Экзорсус, and Club Camel....so if it's the former it's easy to tell which one did it as the bulk of them streamed their kills.</div></div><hr />

You can literally go back to Exorsus vod and see them doing it.</div></div><hr />

I literally can't even, omg</div></div><hr />

<br />
A spell wasn't casting that was supposed to cast, that's a bug. Once they noticed the first time while pet tanking that the cast was bugging they should have stopped doing it, that's clearly bug exploitation. Killing tanks is not unheard of either, but when you let a tank die and helya doesn't cast an ability and you exploit that, that got banned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exorsus are known to use exploits as much as possible. They have even been banned for it in the past.</div></div><hr />

Sorta the first thing I thought of, too. x_x</div></div><hr />
