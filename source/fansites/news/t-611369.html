<br />
Update : It looks like the official FAQ was updated to remove the part about the triple honor gain, removed it from the post. <br />
What is &quot;Recruit-A-Friend&quot;?<br />
Our new friend referral system allows you to recruit some of your friends to join you in World of Warcraft by sending them an invitation email containing a trial activation key. With this key, your friends will be able to set up their own trial accounts.<br />
<br />
To start this process log on to the Account Management section and click the Recruit-A-Friend button. This will take you to the actual friend referral page, where you can enter a friend's email address and name one at a time. If you want, you can also enter a message that will be included in the invitation email.<br />
<br />
What in-game benefits do we get while the accounts we play are linked?<br />
1. Characters on both accounts can summon each other once per hour.<br />
2. While adventuring with your linked friend/family member, you will each gain triple experience.<br />
3. For every two levels the new player earns, the new player can grant one free level-up to a lower-level character played by the veteran player.<br />
<br />
How long will I be linked to my recruit?<br />
The link between the accounts will last for 90 days from the date that your recruit creates an account. Remember that for the link to work properly, your recruit must create a new World of Warcraft account using the 10-day trial key in your invitation email.<br />
<br />
When my friend/family member upgrades from a trial account to a full version of the game, will that break the link between the accounts?<br />
Nope! Your friend/family member will have to upgrade to continue playing past the 10-day trial, and the accounts you play will stay linked until the full 90 days have passed.<br />
<br />
If my friend/family member recruits another friend/family member, am I linked to that person too?<br />
No, these benefits only apply to the person that you referred directly.<br />
<br />
Are there any limits on when and where I can summon my friend?<br />
You and your recruit may only summon new characters of equal or lower level to the character you are playing. There is a one-hour cooldown on this summoning ability. Also, once one of the characters reaches level 60, the summon will no longer function.<br />
<br />
Do I always gain triple experience while I am linked to my recruit?<br />
No, only when you are partied with a character on the linked account and both players are present when slaying the monster or completing the quest. Also, if the two characters are not the same level, only the lower-level character is given the experience boost.<br />
<br />
Is quest experience tripled too?<br />
Yes, but only if the quest was not trivial (gray difficulty) for either character.<br />
<br />
Do normal experience rules apply?<br />
Yes, if a monster is trivial to either player, no experience boost is given.<br />
<br />
How does this affect / stack with Rest State experience?<br />
While you are partied with a linked recruit, any Rest State you have accumulated is not consumed. Only the tripled experience from the Recruit-A-Friend program is applied.<br />
<br />
What if I'm partied with multiple recruits who I'm &quot;linked&quot; to? Do I get quadruple, sextuple experience?<br />
No, you can only ever gain a maximum of triple experience regardless of how many linked recruits you are partied with.<br />
<br />
Are there any limitations to granting levels to characters played by the veteran player?<br />
Yes. The recruit may not grant a level to a character that is equal to or higher than the current level of the character he or she is playing. Additionally, the recruit may not grant a level to a character that is level 60 or higher.<br />
<br />
How can I earn the free 30-day credit?<br />
For each person you refer who upgrades to a retail version of World of Warcraft and purchases his or her first month of game time, the account you sent the invitation from will receive a free credit of 30 days of play time.<br />
<br />
Can I use the free 30-day credit on a different account or at a different time?<br />
No, the 30 days of play time are immediately applied to the account you sent the invitation from once your recruit pays for his or her first month.<br />
<br />
How can I earn the exclusive in-game mount?<br />
For each person you refer who upgrades to a retail version of World of Warcraft and purchases two months of game time, you will be able to give a character on the account you sent the invitation from an exclusive in-game zhevra mount. This unique mount can be claimed through the website, is only available to Recruit-A-Friend participants, and can only be applied to a single character.<br />
<br />
Can I earn multiple 30-day credits and mounts with Recruit-A-Friend?<br />
Yes! These rewards will be given to you for each account you refer that meets the criteria listed above.<br />
<br />
If my recruit cancels the account before purchasing subscription time, can I still earn the 30-day credit or the in-game mount?<br />
If the recruit later comes back, reactivates the account, and purchases subscription time, you will still be eligible for the rewards. Additionally, you can always invite more friends/family members to try World of Warcraft through the Recruit-A-Friend system.</div></div><hr />

It is an excellent tactic.. from a business point of view. From my point of view it just looks like a pathetic ploy for more money. What's next, buying in game gold from blizzard for rl money like was done on other MMOs?</div></div><hr />

However, I would prefer to do this right when WotLK comes out. I can casually grind out the XP until then, however getting from 70 to 80 will be a chore, and getting 300% for the entire duration would really help.<br />
<br />
The wife has 1 account, and I have 2 accounts. My first account has my gear capped out paladin, but my 2nd account has all my 'alts'. I'd be interested in 'referring' her to open a 2nd account for her, transfer all her alts to that account, and see if all of them get the XP bonus.<br />

<br />
It's a nice easy way to get your friends and your alts up to 60 which is already very easy - in order to catch up with the mainstream and be ready for WoTLK.<br />
<br />
It also refers to new characters, hinting that transferring your alt to this new account, will not work.</div></div><hr />

If someone wanted to start a second account just to get the mount they are technically paying for 1 month of service since both accounts are yours, you pay for two on one, and you get a free month on the other. If that is the case you are paying $15 for the mount.<br />
<br />
But is also says the individual must pay for an upgrade to the full version of the game before paying for a two month subscription. I have been playing forever, no idea how much the &quot;full version&quot; download costs. Does anyone know?<br />
<br />
I would be willing to open a second account and pay $15 for the mount, but I am not so sure about $30 to $50 for the game plus the $15 for the month of service.</div></div><hr />

I've gone over it, maybe I'm missing something but aside from saying you cannot grant free levels to players above 60, I don't see any restrictions.<br />

They should probably put a restriction on transfers and when WOTLK comes out, though.</div></div><hr />

Everything cuts off at 60, it says that summons stop working and you cant give a level to someone over 60. As someone also said you need riding skill of 150 to use the mount. <br />
<br />
People are reading waaayy too much into this. It's a &quot;recruit a friend&quot; program for christ sake. Yeah its a marketing ploy but it has genuine advantages for the &quot;legitimate player&quot; <br />
<br />
Chinese farmers are going to do what they do no matter what, and Blizzard just made double their money on each of them. And I don't see anything &quot;shameless&quot; here at all. If someones going to exploit the system (so to speak) and make a new account for themselves then sure, you're paying for it - that's your choice.<br />
<br />
If you actually recruit a friend (!), you get 1 month free game time + a mount. Your friend pays for at least 2 months playtime, again where do you lose out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact of the matter is this: you spend more money, and you have an advantage in the real game. This is fundamentally different from any promotion Blizzard has ever had. It's also a sign that Blizzard has lost its scruples about abusing this business model.<br />
<br />
The fact that they can't handle the criticism on their own forum, even though it is otherwise a 100% legitimate post, suggests that they're terribly ashamed of their behavior as well.<br />
<br />
I just hope the short term influx of users was worth the complete loss of their credibility. I will never view Blizzard the same way again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Pay more for an advantage&quot;? How? By exploiting the system for your 9th alt? If you have to jump rings and dish out cash, then it's not meant for you. It's for new people to play catch up for LK without playing through a couple hundred hours of antiqued content.<br />
<br />
They should apply it retro-actively, and bump up the benefit for Scroll of Resurrection, but outside of that I think it's fine.</div></div><hr />

Many people have repeatedly requested that Blizzard improve old-world content, or add more material to those areas. If this is their response then it's a bit sad.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is essentially providing a power leveling service for people who either pay for multiple accounts, or convince their friends to pay for one. If that's not &quot;paying for an advantage&quot; then I'm not really sure what is.</div></div><hr />

You were banned for posting outside the forum rules, get over it.<br />
<br />
To say they are ashamed of their behaviour is absolute tripe. It's making them more money, and its making new customers happy (on a seperate note, were you this upset when they reduced the exp needed between 20 and 60). It's also making old customers happy as their friends can catch up easier. How can you not see the advantages to this scheme? <br />
<br />
Read this sentence No character over level 60 can be affected ok? Anyone who is already in game with any real seriousness is level 70, probably on more than one character. We are now on the second expansion, are you REALLY upset that people can reach 60 faster? If so, I pity you. <br />

If you don't believe me, you can read the responses on their official thread:<br />
http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=8557153786<br />
<br />
Opinion of this new policy is largely negative, and deservedly so. Anyone who has played an online game that gives advantages to players who pay more money, knows exactly how repugnant an idea it is. You can honorably defend Blizzard for their decision here, but anyone who actually cares about the company will be willing to tell them it's a bad idea.<br />
<br />
The entire spirit of an MMO depends on the fact that in-game accomplishment is solitary means gaining in-game rewards. This is especially true when major gameplay features (e.g. experience, honor, teleportation) are involved. Bending the rules to make a quick buck are not exactly what you would expect to see from a good company.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard were really interested in making the game enjoyable for everyone, then they would make it so these features are available to everyone currently subscribed. They don't want that though; they want fast money. They don't care if the subscribers are going to be long-time players, or even if they'll be new players (multiboxing will probably contribute a lot to this). They just want cash. <br />
<br />
I have played Blizzard games for a very long time. I played WarCraft II and Diablo when I was in middle school, and have bought every single one of their games since then. Never have I seen such a greedy or shortsighted business decision. I can only imagine that this has something to do with the Activision merger, but you never know.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to state this as firmly as I possibly can; if you support Blizzard's decision here, then you're just as shortsighted as whatever exec pushed this concept live, and you probably don't know / care very much about Blizzard's survival as a company.<br />
<br />
So enjoy your dumb zebra. Let's hope the corpse doesn't stink up the place.</div></div><hr />

This new policy goes against the spirit of MMO's. If anything it will encourage existing players to create new accounts. I think there is really little room for growth now in Western markets, they really need to focus on Asian market now.<br />
<br />
But yes, new policy is (as others have said) a glorified offical power leveling service designed to suck in more money. Why should existing accounts not benefit from this?</div></div><hr />

The fact that they can't handle the criticism on their own forum, even though it is otherwise a 100% legitimate post, suggests that they're terribly ashamed of their behavior as well.<br />
<br />
I just hope the short term influx of users was worth the complete loss of their credibility. I will never view Blizzard the same way again.<br />

<br />
Yes, very true. They are starting to use some nasty ways to earn more money now. Why would a veteran player recruit a new friend to play? If they have ever wanted, or have ever had the desire to recruit some friends of them to play, they would have ALREADY done it. This policy seems to be some &quot;oh nice method for your FRIEND to catch up&quot;, but in fact it is just some dirty tricks to exploit money from the rich (or zealous) players to help them gain advantage and at the same time check another object in their &quot;ACHIEVEMENT PAGE&quot;, in exchange of REAL MONEY. I am sure this is just the beginning, lets see what ELSE can they do. GREAT BLIZZTARD GG! Well, wheres aoc...</div></div><hr />

Are you guys really that defensive about the work you put in to leveling a character 1-60? I've recruited eight friends since WoW came out. I was already at the level cap(both 60 and 70) when they started playing. Every single one of them eventually got bored and quit because they were playing alone and leveling is extremely boring. I don't have time to rush my low level friends through quests in Westfall all day, and I certainly don't have time to level alts with each of them. I would've killed to be able to level alts with all of them at 3x the speed, getting insta-level boosts from them if they got ahead of me.<br />
<br />
Where is the downside to being able to level a new character with a friend at 3x the speed? We've all gone through vanilla WoW content countless times already, why complain about a way to speed it up more?<br />
<br />
A lot of people are also complaining about multiboxing. That has always been ridiculously easy for people with the resources. Well before the lvl 20-60 XP boost, people were leveling alts in 2-3 days /played time by out-of-party multiboxing, particularly in instances.<br />
<br />
The fact is most of us have gone through the vanilla WoW content so many times and we know how boring it gets, especially when all your friends are at 70 running around Outland while you're killing tigers in STV. How does it hurt to give a nice bump to mostly new players and the veteran players that decide to level with them?</div></div><hr />

Not sure how someone leveling up their character a little faster hurts me. The leveling bonus is a nice to perk that would encourage veteran players to go back and do some old content with new players. I know from leveling a character recently that it hard to find groups, and getting some veteran players to play alts would really help strengthen the WoW community by showing some noobs the ropes. <br />
<br />
As for the zebra mount I'm also not seeing what the fuss is about. There have been plenty of novelty/vanity items that have been only available from means outside of wow. Yes they typically require money to get, however this zebra mount is totally free. You don't have to buy a new account or anything like that you just have to get a friend a friend to play and upgrade. If your friend upgrades he/she probably had fun and doesn't mind spending the money and you get a cool mount. If you really want one of these mounts and I highly recommend hanging out in lowbie zones and meet some new players. I'm guessing you could probably find a new player in a starting zone who would be happy to put you down as the reference account for a zebra mount if you toss em 100 gold or offer to power level them through some dungeons.</div></div><hr />

well the whole point for me in lving up is to see/experience &amp; feel it -let the experience move you<br />
its a bit like a film you want to soak it up &amp; let it take you places etc<br />
the whole idea of speeding lving up imho is stupid why rush when somethings good anyway?<br />
lets all rush to lv up so more ppl can stand in IF bored &amp; waiting for wotlk to come out :/<br />
it dont make sense. 1 ticket to see the dark knight plz- yes sir<br />

I can definitely see where you're coming from. Leveling my first few characters to 60 was the best part of WoW to me so far. However, with so much extra content being added, the vanilla WoW experience is becoming a smaller and smaller part of the game. Like the FAQ said, all the perks only last 90 days or until they hit 60. To me, this seems like a reasonable way to allow new players to go through the original WoW quickly to experience Outland and prepare for WotLK.<br />
<br />
That being said, I remember leveling on the TBC beta with the accelerated XP(2x I believe) and it didn't really inhibit me from experiencing all of the quests and zones that were implemented at that time. So this doesn't really seem like that big of a deal to me.</div></div><hr />

How would you have that already? Private server? One would have to wait for your &quot;friend&quot; to play for 2 months?<br />

Also, if my friend and I start at the same level.. get to level 10, I can apply 5 levels to a level 40 alt?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get the mount when your friend pays for the game time. Also, no you can't apply the insta-levels to characters higher than the linked player's character. For example, if your friend is level 12 by the time you get around to making a lvl 1 alt, he can insta-level you to 6. They couldn't boost your level 15 alt to 21 though. Basically it's all designed to keep you and your friend at the same level while leveling at 3x the rate.</div></div><hr />

basically sent the trial -&gt; activated to full account (19.99) -&gt; bought game card (2 months for 29.99) [note: paying with CC doesnt work as it wont charge you until the time is up]<br />

i now have a fresh account with 3 months of time (get 1 free month with game) and 1 free month on my main account... i can give it to a friend (as intended) or let it expire for a $38 mount</div></div><hr />

<br />
The free levels only work for the veteran player if they use them on a character lower than the referred players character. So even in Wrath, the highest you could get would be 75, ((80-70)/2)=5. But as it mentioned, this only works until level 60.</div></div><hr />

Oh dear lord, so much fuss over what? A unique mount and some easier experience ...<br />
<br />
Really - the GENUINE players who are recruiting friends benefit immensely. The Veteran gets a shiny new mount and the new player catches up to his friend a bit easier. <br />
<br />
Yes, it makes them more money. Yes, the player base grows. Yes, it's possibly an evil plan to get us more addicted. Yes, it's business. <br />
<br />
Assuming you do it the way they intend, you get a FREE month playtime and a FREE mount. Of course some players will go out and buy themselves a second account - that's your choice. Sure Blizzard know that, but they also know that a lot of their hardcore players already have more than one account. I myself have three accounts, however I'm not going to have a Zhevra mount. Why? Cos I don't care enough to get one. <br />
<br />
Whatever way I or you swing it, it's a great business move and we all know business is about making money. Don't tell me you wouldn't do the same if it was your company.</div></div><hr />

I may well use this to dual-box 2 alts to 60, which I wouldn't otherwise have done- how does this affect you as a player? It doesn't last till 70, let alone 80, it's just a way of allowing people to get through the barren, player-less wastes of Azeroth to 60 and get into Outland quicker, meaning less new players will drop dead from boredom, and more people will be able to level alts quickly with guildies. The alternative would be allowing people to buy pre-made level 60's, would you be happier with that? Why must you asshats complain about EVERYTHING???</div></div><hr />

I for one am shocked and apalled and may slit my wrists as a result!<br />
<br />
Fuck's sake, like there wasn't TCG loot in game for people who spend money to get it? Like there aren't Blizzcon rewards for people who spend money going to Blizzard events? Like there aren't collectors editions that give you in-game rewards for spending more money? Like this is something new? I may well use this to dual-box 2 alts to 60, which I wouldn't otherwise have done- how does this affect you as a player? It doesn't last till 70, let alone 80, it's just a way of allowing people to get through the barren, player-less wastes of Azeroth to 60 and get into Outland quicker, meaning less new players will drop dead from boredom, and more people will be able to level alts quickly with guildies. The alternative would be allowing people to buy pre-made level 60's, would you be happier with that? Why must you asshats complain about EVERYTHING???<br />

The reason they have done this is because once an MMO is well established it is hard for new players to really get into the real wow because old Azeroth is either empty or full of power-leveling alts. This will help Blizzard bring new customers into the game and also give them a boost through the abandoned areas of azeroth. And the recruiter gets some free levels? So what? Why do people care if an alt skips the evil that is Stranglethorn Vale? &quot;Hang opn a minute you skipped your mid-thirties? You're no longer good enough to raid with us!&quot;<br />
<br />
Worst case senario is that we get lots of people hit outlands who don't know how to play their class. But really is this any different to now? People power-leveled alts without learning to play before and they will continue to do it after this promotion has ended.</div></div><hr />

&quot;recruit a friend and get a lvl 80 toon with S5 ready to adventure in arenas&quot;.<br />
<br />
Zhevra won't give me any advantage over anyone here... and if chinese farmers, multi-boxers, etc... started to exist because of this, would be a reason to get worried. But they alread exist and level their toons really fast alread for this to make any real diference.<br />

And it doesn't look like it works for 61-80. Stop saying that the 1st lvl 80 will be a &quot;recruit a friend&quot; player.<br />

Is there some epidemic going around that cause temporary blindness. Now if everybody that saw this would actually take the time to read the FAQ that was linked in this news. U would notice that u cannot use this past lvl 60 and surtenly not to 80!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Question : Are there any limitations to granting levels to characters played by the veteran player?<br />
<br />
Answer : Yes. The recruit may not grant a level to a character that is equal to or higher than the current level of the character he or she is playing.<br />
Additionally, the recruit may not grant a level to a character that is level 60 or higher.</div></div><hr />

No where did I say anything about granting an extra lvl. L2Read yourself. I was talking about getting triple xp from 55 to 80. Since creating a DK on a new account. (you transfer one of your lvl 70 alts over) would start out at lvl 55 and then you create a lvl 55 DK on your main account and then Duel box both of them from lvl 55 to 80 with triple XP.</div></div><hr />

but... if i have a lvl 20 alt on my veteran account and my new friend lvl from 0 to 40... will i have 20 free lvl to use to my previous lvl 20 alt? or will this work only on same lvl or lvl by lvl... sorry if my english isnt so good but i hope u got my question....<br />
<br />
edit: another exemple... if i have a lvl 25 alt, then i recruit a new friend and he will lvl up to lvl 70... will i have 35 free lvls to use on my lvl 25 that will become lvl 60?....</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rothomp3</div><div class="date">2008-08-06, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You get the mount when your friend pays for the game time. Also, no you can't apply the insta-levels to characters higher than the linked player's character. For example, if your friend is level 12 by the time you get around to making a lvl 1 alt, he can insta-level you to 6. They couldn't boost your level 15 alt to 21 though. Basically it's all designed to keep you and your friend at the same level while leveling at 3x the rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is of course the reason why all the people bitching about this as a &quot;paid power leveling service&quot; are full of crap. Read the way the program actually works people. It's intended to fix the major issues that have always existed with playing with RL friends. The 3x XP only applies if both characters are the same level, if one gets ahead of the other then only the lower level character gets 3x XP. This is to help both characters stay the same level.<br />
<br />
Yes, obviously it helps multiboxers too. But it is not &quot;paying for an in-game advantage&quot; because the benefits stop at level 60. Only level 70 and then 80 matter, get this through your skulls: Blizzard (rightfully) does not care about anything but level cap. Only the level cap matters. Getting there is not balanced, getting there is not part of the game they balance for. There is no in-game advantage to getting to 60 faster than someone else, since you then have to level the old way to the level cap, which is the only part that matters.</div></div><hr />

Isn't the whole point of a power leveling service to get quickly to a higher level in the game? Isn't that exactly what this is?<br />
<br />
Let's talk details:<br />
<br />
A) You give Blizzard more money<br />
B) You (and/or your alt) get to level three times faster<br />

It's a new account, paying the same price as anyone else. If you decide to buy yourself a new account just because you want a Zhevra Mount, well then that's your decision. This impacts on your play in no way whatsoever. <br />

It's the same as the TCG loot cards, if someone wants to buy one on eBay for €500 or buy 10 boxes of cards just to get an item that gives them zero advantage in game then good luck to them.<br />

<br />
It's not a betrayl of ethics.... It would be it they made a new official leveling service where you pay them x amount of money to level any char of your choice to any desired level. With the recruit a friend you have to be playing and questing with them to gain the experience bonuses. I'm sure you can powerlevel a char through instances way faster than you can quest with your bud. If anything its a smart business move that brings in new revenue... sorta like the Mr.T adds and what not. Me personally I have been trying to get two of my firends to play now with the mount and the leveling of an alt as an incentive it's a very smart offer on Blizz's part. Kinda like winning a prize in a box of cereal and sending away for it.</div></div><hr />

The llegalized method still requires you to be in a party with this recruit leveling up. As with the Mage/Paladin combo you just sit back and loot really. People will always be incompetent at max level due to ignorance or misinformation so thats not new. You can't always base skill off of someone's performance in pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then at best I can accuse you of being naive, if not willfully ignorant. Even if we ignore that this can be abused by multiboxers to level all of their characters quickly, the policy allows players to grant free levels to people. <br />
<br />
There's nothing faster than getting a free level up, and that's exactly what this allows players to do. The restrictions placed on it are irrelevant, since most people aren't going to care if it's only limited to &lt; 60. Most people looking to power level are interested in TBC content anyway, and this is providing them a quick and easy way to get there.<br />
<br />
Example: Your friend levels to 60, and one of your lvl 30 alts can get insta-leveled to 60 without any work. That's pretty lame. And it's something that can only happen if you're willing to fork over some extra dough to Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

More and more Blizzard is trying to see what they can &quot;sell&quot; people in-game, using real world money. It started with WoW TCG, and now they're experimenting with in-game bonuses that actually affect gameplay.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's execs are testing the water. If they think they can sell you something, they will. If they think it's ok to start selling in-game bonuses (free exp, free levels, maybe free epics) then they absolutely will. Unless you're willing to call them on this bullshit, then don't expect Blizzard to stop testing the water.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard's community doesn't send a clear message that this is bad behavior, then WoW will soon end up like all the Korean MMO's that sell gear to players for the swipe of a credit card.

Even if we ignore that this can be abused by multiboxers to level all of their characters quickly, the policy allows players to grant free levels to people. <br />
<br />
There's nothing faster than getting a free level up, and that's exactly what this allows players to do. The restrictions placed on it are irrelevant, since most people aren't going to care if it's only limited to &lt; 60. Most people looking to power level are interested in TBC content anyway, and this is providing them a quick and easy way to get there.<br />
<br />
Example: Your friend levels to 60, and one of your lvl 30 alts can get insta-leveled to 60 without any work. That's pretty lame. And it's something that can only happen if you're willing to fork over some extra dough to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
First off the recruit has to be higher then your alt to grant them levels. So either you or your friend still has to actually play the game and quest for exp. The free levels can only be appiled to one char no all your alts. So I wouldnt say no work was involved for your suggested &quot;Paid levels&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's only up to lvl60, and honestly thats the most boring part of the game for anyone that's a veteran player. Having grinded 4 lvl 70s I despise having to go through all the same quests I've done multiple times. I want other toons for arena, but can't stand the idea of spending a solid month to lvl, and then another 3 months to get ready for endgame raiding or arena. Hell if I could pay to have a instant lvl70 I'd probably do it. <br />
<br />
And I do think this is a great marketing idea by Blizz. Kudos to whoever came up with it. Get more players in the game, and generate extra revenue. US is all about capitalism bishes, learn to deal with it.</div></div><hr />

More and more Blizzard is trying to see what they can &quot;sell&quot; people in-game, using real world money. It started with WoW TCG, and now they're experimenting with in-game bonuses that actually affect gameplay.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's execs are testing the water. If they think they can sell you something, they will. If they think it's ok to start selling in-game bonuses (free exp, free levels, maybe free epics) then they absolutely will. Unless you're willing to call them on this bullshit, then don't expect Blizzard to stop testing the water.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard's community doesn't send a clear message that this is bad behavior, then WoW will soon end up like all the Korean MMO's that sell gear to players for the swipe of a credit card. Sound unbelievable? Stop being so naive. Business is business, and if Blizzard/Activision think they can take your money, they sure will.<br />
<br />
<br />
In regards to the TCG, its apart of WoW merchandise just like the comics, apparel, board game and etc. The stuff they try to sell you ingame comes from loot cards if you actually played the TCG. Some don't bother and Buy it on eaby for crazy amounts of money but Blizzard does not see a penny of that because they're not the ones selling it. Whoever got the card when he/she bought a pack of cards is selling it on ebay. Giving exp and levels to a char is hardly gamebreaking its just the same as your friends pwereleveling your char and if that's the case they should ban instances lol. As for the Korean itemshop model it will never fly so don't get your hopes up soon Billzard will officially be selling epic items in their epic itemshop for 20 bucks a pop... so i'm the Naive one huh?</div></div><hr />

It will still be quite a big boost, even after you consider the group nerf.* Even at its worst with 5 people.* It would be close to everyone getting solo XP while still in a group.* That will still make for some quick lvling.*</div></div><hr />

You're not taking into account that the Triple XP isn't just for mobs, it's also for quests. I find that just plain ridiculous. Think about how many quests you have to do to gain a level, now divide by 3 and you got yourself a level. That means if you were going to get on and get a level with your friend for that day, you'd gain 3 levels instead. Ridiculous!</div></div><hr />

He ran himself through dungeons with his 70 with his two new linked accounts minimized. He kept them the same level and was able to level up rather quickly. After he had the second set of characters made he went 1-48 on his druid...in 6 hours play time (30-48 boost from grant a level) not to mention a rogue to 30 in that same 6 hours (no level boosts for him). Even an experienced player solo questing can only reach 30 in 24 hours played time, maybe a little less if they are really good. This is a relatively cheap way to level as many level 60s as you want in less time then it would take you to level one toon to 60 the normal old fashioned way, and it can get rather lame after you've done it many times. To set up a couple accounts only costs you about 20 dollars each, because you don't need tbc on either of these new accounts unless you plan to keep them. As long as you're willing to spend 25 dollars to transfer each character to you main account, permitted you don't want to keep two, then this is a good way to give people that have already leveled multiple 70s a break from doing the level grinding again. If you are planning on getting a 70 of each or most of the classes then this is the way to do it, and if you already have multiple 70s, you should know enough to learn quickly enough how to play your new class from the level 60-70 Outlands grind. And it's perfectly legit for you to do this, it even says so in the FAQs (though not directly, of course). Its just more money for them, what do they care how many characters and how fast you level them. Still its a cheap way to grind, and if you're a dedicated enough player its worth the money, and it'll basically cost you about 30 dollars a character all said and done.</div></div><hr />

I started a new char with my girlfriend as the 'inviting' linked account. It's insane, we're on a new server (because she has too many bloody chars on our main one!) so can't transfer gold. It's actually a real struggle to pay for skills as you level and at times I couldn't afford drink. She rolled a mage, but despite me upgrading to a full expansion account and entering a three month sub, she couldn't trade me conjured water because I have a trial account.<br />

I think it'll feel nicer around the 30+ level, especially since at that point most WoW vets have many quests they hate and will be pleased to skip!</div></div><hr />

you'll probably have to wait until they charge your cc. i think the requirement is having the new account paid for two months. with a game card, the amount is used instantly. with a cc, you'll have to wait until they charge it the next time. you can find the pending charge date under account management.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The major flaw about Recruit-a-Friend is that it's giving people gameplay rewards for actions performed outside of the gameplay. This is breaking an important principle in MMO gaming. It should never happen. Only what players do in the game, should affect what happens to your character in the game. Especially when it comes to basic gameplay mechanics like xp and leveling. Blizzard knows this very well, and that's some of the reason they have taken an aggressive stance against various forms of cheating, like hacks, account trading, gold and item trading (RMT), botting, powerleveling and so on.<br />
<br />
Not only is R-a-F a powerleveling service provided by Blizzard, but it's also additionally flawed by having various strings attached to it that makes it unusable by a lot of the players.<br />
<br />
The most obvious problem is that if you do not have anyone to recruit, you're left out. If you don't have the hardware or money to multibox, you're left out. If you come from a country like Denmark, where this kind of scheme is illegal, you're left out.<br />
<br />
This is the second basic MMO gaming principle that Blizzard violates by using the R-a-F ploy. They are effectively discriminating players by doling out xp and levels for only a select part of their customer base.<br />
<br />
Some of you are saying, &quot;Yeah, but it's for a greater good. They are facilitating players, so that they can catch up with the other players&quot;. Well, I agree with you. There should be an option to skip leveling, since there's not enough players in the starting areas to make our time there enjoyable. And with those who are able to use R-a-F leveling up in a jiffy, it will be even more empty and boring.<br />
<br />
Some seem to totally disregard the fact that R-a-F is an extremely poor solution to the problem. There's a lot of other options that could facilitate *everybody* in the same way, instead of just catering to those who provide Blizzard with extra income.<br />
<br />
Now, some of you might say &quot;Well, Blizzard are all about making money. If you don't like it, you can play something else&quot;. That's true. They are free to do whatever they want with their own game. They're free to degrade the game, sell out and disgrace themselves if they want to. But, remember that a large part of Blizzard's success and henceforth a large part of what makes them so great is that they always have been all about putting *good and fair gameplay* in front of gaining monetary wealth. This has always been Blizzards official development strategy. They have been proud about it, and not afraid to use it as a selling point. A standpoint that has gained them a lot of respect amongst their fans.<br />
<br />
<br />
US CM Belfaire posted on the subject before R-a-F came in effect, i.e. Blizzard's official stance on the subject:<br />
<br />
&quot;We want all players to be on equal footing, regardless of income and livelihood. You say that because it's open to everybody, that it won't give one player an advantage, but this is patently false. While we do offer paid services, these are technical or vanity services as opposed to services which offer a real and true advantage in the game, like RMT gold buying would.&quot;<br />

<br />
Recent interview with Paul Sams, the &quot;Chief Operating Officer&quot; of Blizzard Entertainment. In it, he explained a bit about Blizzard's way of dealing with business models:<br />
<br />
&quot;At Blizzard, the business model doesn't come until late in the game. We focus on what the experience is, what the gameplay is and what the overall kind of feature set is before we start talking about what the business model is. I know there is a lot of speculation, but candidly, we just don't know yet.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of businesspeople would say &quot;oh well, the important stuff is how we generate profit and revenue&quot;. But, our feeling is that's secondary. We need to focus on what the experience is, make sure that the gameplay is right, and then we wrap a business model around that.&quot;<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
So, why have Blizzard launched R-a-F? Honestly, I don't know. But I do know that there is dissent amongst the people at Blizzard about this. Unfortunately, they are bound to silence as employees. Some bullheaded businesspeople have probably forced this decision, and now they are testing the water while at the same time stealing potential customers from the new MMOs like WAR. How do you think that will affect the evolution of MMORPG gaming for us as gamers?<br />
<br />
So, yeah... Before you start blindly defending R-a-F, just remember that it *could* have been fashioned in a way that would facilitate *all* players and without breaking these fundamental principles. There's no need to go into tunnel-vision mode.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">skinnypuppy</div><div class="date">2008-10-07, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">this was the perfect marketing ploy for blizzard to introduce new players to the game, and couldn't have been better timing. I've recruited three friends so far, and a mount has nothing to do with it. i was recruited into wow just after the southpark episode aired a few months before burning crusade was released. my recruiter gave me minor help in understanding the game and leveling my toon as a noob. with x3xp and 50% extra rep, this has given me the perfect reason to create a couple new alts, level, and teach my new recruits. the grant a level helps me keep-up with them as they solo level while i play my 70's doing daily quests and what not. being new to the game and the next expansion releasing soon with a level cap of 80 its hard enough for them to level and even more so if they didn't get the x3xp. sure gold farmers in china will abuse this, but blizzard will still profit off them no different from the profit they make off my friends. i get a free month of game play -$15, my recruit pays for multiple months +$15x?, the cost of purchasing a retail version of wow with the burning crusade expansion package +$50, the wrath of the linch king expansion +$40. blizzard makes their money regardless of gold farmers abusing it. the more money blizzard makes, the better. as long as they profit from wow they will continue evolving the game in many ways including future expansions and weekly updates. i for one appreciate their hard work, and dedication every day when i log-on. <br />

&quot;Dod&quot; makes some very good points on the opposing side of my view towards the recruit a friend ploy. i agree with much of his disagreements towards the subject, and is amongst the best posts on the subject. i would like to add that not having the money for better hardware, or multiple accounts to multibox is not necessarily blizzards fault... get a better job and drive a scooter is all i have to say about that. not having any friends to recruit? i'm sorry you are a non-social shut in that hates people, but wow is a very social game as a mmorpg. finally, people in places like Denmark, where this kind of scheme is illegal, sorry you're left out, and that it would be unfair of me to say move to another country if you dont like it. but hey im in America and its illegal to smoke pot, drink under 21, or simply smoke a Cuban cigar, though these things have nothing to do with the world of warcraft. Dod... i salute you, great post seriously.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, why are all these people whining? If it doesn't effect you, why do you care? It's not as if they are forcing you to go out and get a second account. Or go out and get some friends. Next people will be flaming blizzard for releasing another expansion and labelling it as a clever, greed induced, marketing ploy, by forcing you to pay money to level your characters past 70.</div></div><hr />

it's a very good method to get more players, and has a good effect giving some more reasons to the old wow player that invited his friend, to raise an alt in the same time with his friend and help him understand wow better and faster. Not to mention some classes really suck at solo play at low lvl,<br />
<br />
Anyway with all the good words i said in the last paragraph, Blizzard the &quot;invite a friend&quot; still suck for me and my 3 friends that have joined wow in the last 2 months, because you made country discriminations and it is not allowed in our country. We pay same fees, we play same game and we are europeans, still we are discriminated over other european countryes. Hmm guess what dear blizzard, this sucks.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, it's probably just a logistical thing.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Blizzard as a company has people that are on the &quot;US team&quot; and the &quot;EU team&quot; and they work somewhat separately. (Besides the fact that we get the same dungeons and world.) It might be that Recruit-a-Friend was something that only the US team came up with. Maybe the European Blizz people thought it was a bad idea or would make people level faster than they wanted, but the US people pushed it through for NA anyway.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they just weren't able to get the EU to approve recruit-a-friend, or there were localization issues.</div></div><hr />
