Upcoming Reputation Changes<br />
Earning reputation with various factions has long been an important part to World of Warcraft and as time has gone on, we've made tweaks and changes to the system to make it more interesting and to give players access to unique items. For example, we recently hotfixed the game to apply a change to some reputation items which you can read about in our recently updated blog that allows players to purchase certain items much sooner. And we're not done!<br />
<br />
Coming in a future patch, earning reputation is going to become much more fluid. Basically, once one of your characters has reached at least Revered reputation with a faction, all other characters on the same Battle.net account will then earn reputation with the same faction at twice the rate. Going one step further, and as an added bonus, your main character who reached Revered will also begin to earn double the reputation as he or she climbs to Exalted.<br />
<br />
Here's a simplified break down:<br />
<br />
Any single character earns Revered reputation with a faction All other characters on the Battle.net account begin to earn double reputation for that one same faction The Revered character earns double reputation as he or she works toward Exalted ??? Profit <br />
<br />
We’ll keep you posted as this change is closer to being implemented. In the meantime, we’d love to hear your feedback!</div></div><hr />

<br />
After hitting Exalted on one of your characters, your other characters gains Honored standing with that faction.<br />
<br />
I expected Blizzard would change the gain of reputation, and I'm glad they did. At the moment I have no urge to level my alts because I'm already so busy with dailies.<br />

speak for yourself son, grinding rep is not fun and will never be, if the stuff you just grind makes you proud and a worthy achievement, reconsider your gaming career.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is plenty of people who play activelly with more than one toon, I play with 4 toons all the time for example. Farming the same thing for months more than one time is just stupid and boring, specially now that we have so many factions on MoP.<br />
<br />
I do agree that they didn't need to nerf the &quot;main&quot; rep farming after revered, but the changes to be &quot;alt-wide&quot; is good.</div></div><hr />

Cool bro you think dailies are fun. Not the rest of us. Get off your high horse.</div></div><hr />

While I like that you're other characters have less of a grind to do, I don't think you should gain double the rep after revered. Grind hard once, and then make it a bit easier for alts</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ugum</div><div class="date">2012-10-04, 05:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should have made a reputation tabard for each faction that is BoA and only obtainable when you hit Exalted. Your first character hits exalted, by grinding it as it stands now, and then he can buy the tabard to send to Alts for increased rep gain. I kinda liked all the different tabards in Cataclysm.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Holy</div><div class="date">2012-10-04, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like the quicker alt rep gaining. The faster revered to exalted, however, doesn't seem necessary. They should just have it where when one character gets to exalted (at the normal speed) then alts get the double rep. I can some people not wanting to be rushed through revered... you feel a bit more accomplished when you finish that grind up. However, I can't advocate this &quot;Wah! Blizz is nerfing because people whined! Wah!&quot; attitude that a lot of people seem to have (people who will likely take advantage of the system and love it, but want to feel like cool guys on the forums.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was thinking the same thing ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, if it takes half the time from revered to exalted, doesn't that make it basically cost 10.5k rep? Making it faster than getting to revered?<br />
<br />
Friendly 3k<br />
Honored 6k<br />
Revered 12k<br />
Exalted 21k (21/2 post patch) = 10.5k<br />
<br />
<br />
This seems... odd. And given the fact that each rank has been giving more and more dailies, I feel as though twice the rate is an extreme overkill.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tinykong</div><div class="date">2012-10-04, 05:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should have just made each rep have a turn in that isn't ridiculously low drop rate or turn reputation dailies into weeklies. I really, REALLY dispise that dailies are required if you want to earn rep. If I miss a day because I only have a few hours and decide to run dungeons instead, I lose a day of progress that I can never get back.<br />
<br />
If I could devote my entire weekend to completing rep quests, I could run dungeons with my friends instead. However, since I want cloud serpent mounts and need rep to get valor items, I'm stuck saying no to dungeon runs because I only have 2 hours to play and have to complete a daily circuit.</div></div><hr />

Same logic can be applied to everything in WoW: &quot;What's so hard about killing trash? Lets remove it and kill only bosses&quot;. &quot;What's so hard about flying to your destination? Lets just teleport all over the place or put all NPCs in one room&quot;. &quot;What's so hard about farming reputation? Lets remove whole concept&quot;. &quot;What's so hard about fishing? Just place NPC called FishVendor that gives it for free&quot;<br />

Oh and the people blaming it on casuals are way wrong. Casuals aren't even 90 yet.<br />
<br />
This is all the people who said &quot;I love BC&quot; then when they got rep grind started whining.<br />

I'm not complaining, I'm just trying to get it straight... I guess I'll have that Klaxxi scorpion mount faster than I thought.<br />

Killing trash has its place, and it's easy to weed out who's going to be doing something stupid in the raid when you see someone actually manage to die to it.<br />
<br />
Comparing it to flying made no sense. Are you high?<br />
<br />
Rep farming makes sense, but it's not what keeps people around giving them something to do. There's already way more to the game than that. I know you can do better than this, pleb.</div></div><hr />

What's hard about doing the same crap day after day? You people don't seem to know what this word means, and you should stop using it. I have a better sentence you can use that properly expresses what they're doing:<br />
&quot;What the hell, Blizzard? Why would you make rep grinding less tedious and mundane?&quot;<br />

People who HAVE A JOB and do the same thing every day don't want to log on to WoW and feel like having a 2nd job of doing the exact same things every day.<br />

I'm not complaining, I'm just trying to get it straight... I guess I'll have that Klaxxi scorpion mount faster than I thought.<br />

I think in your case this doesn't help or hurt you. For the first character rep grind stays the same. I think, I might have misunderstood... guess the facepalm I did after reading the Blue poster actually meme &quot;Profit...&quot; might have hit my head harder than I wanted.</div></div><hr />

For all you nay-sayers, I want you to think about this for a second, do you honestly think come patch 5.1 or later when people are leveling their alt that they are gonna grind this rep again? NO, they are not. What they will be doing is joining heroics expecting you to carry them so they can get the latest tier that got moved to JP or VP. You can't kick all of them so your gonna have to suck it up. At least this way there will be more options to give you that leg up on alt number 2,3,4,ect so you wont be as much of a carry.</div></div><hr />

That means Honored has 12000 rep and Revered has 10500 rep to get. That seems ass-backward as fuck. <br />

2x Rep when you reach Exalted wouldve been the BEST.</div></div><hr />

As of writing this I believe I am sitting at 59 exalted reps accross my accounts with my main sitting at 57. I would hate to see the grind from rev-exalt cut in half on my main becuse that would trivialize the accomplishment of getting the rep in the first place. However, I have changed mains for this expansion so if I were to reach exalted on my current priest main but wanted the achievent on my warlock just for completion and OCD I could see the final grind cut in half only after reaching exalted on one character within the battle.net account. This wouls make life easier for folks like me who still hold on hope for that main to become god like again and cut down on the craziness of grinding all of the new reps until your eyes bleed. But fo the love of jeebus don't cut the initial grind down and make that last run meaningless. <br />
<br />
This would make it easier for smaller guilds that rely on alts to fill in to not have to wait weeks for people to get a certain item on an alt that comes from a rep. And since mounts and titles are account wide, there would be no need to qq over someones fresh 90 running around on some pretty mount.<br />
<br />
---------- Post added 2012-10-04 at 06:21 PM ----------<br />

Oooh oooh I just had an idea. Make this a guild perk for guilds reaching a certain ammount of reputations exalted. That would give the grinders something to do and a reward for doing it while keeping the elitist happy that not everyone would get the perk. Just a though.</div></div><hr />

In any case, the alt change is good but the double rep for exalted is absolutely retarded bullshit fuckery which probably means this expansion once more has attraction for couple weeks after which when everything is done one can just quit unless 2-3 raids a week justifies the cost.</div></div><hr />

Biggest problem I've had so far with MoP (the only problem, honestly) is now that my main is doing dailies and getting gear, I have zero desire to get my alts on because 85-90 was too cutsceney and slow (rather have to do twice as many quests and not watch cutscenes, tbh) and then I have 300 rep a day grinds for all these factions to do much of anything....reminds me of BC when I had to retire all 9 of my alts. The change to alt rep makes me a lot more likely to keep enjoying my alts, so I can keep playing like i'd prefer to instead of like I basically have to like in BC (also the main thing about BC I didn't like, besides artificial progression blocks that made it so I couldn't switch mains 5 months in when I decided I didn't like warrior anymore).<br />
<br />
However.....this doesn't give us more choice. It's an advantage to players with a lot of alts (yay!) but takes away the feeling of the long rep-grind and it's satisfaction from the people with no or less alts.<br />
<br />
I wish they'd left it as normal for mains. I'm hoping actually that there's a technical problem with excluding your main from getting the bonus, so they've just doubled the revered-honored grind to make it the same as it is now...although then, you'd still be stuck on all your alts at revered instead of honored like now.<br />
<br />
Maybe there's no way to leave it the same for everyone so that mains can still have to grind (which I'd prefer.)<br />
<br />
I love achieving the grind on my main, but like account-wide mounts and pets, I just don't have the time or energy to get those benefits on my alts. So, I'm glad about the alts part of this change. I'm quite sad about the change to mains, though. If I can think of anything constructive to say besides &quot;I don't like this&quot; I might make my first non-bug-related post on the official forums in quite some time.</div></div><hr />

Good riddance to every millisecond I would spend on rep that I won't spend thanks to this change, and good on blizzard for recognizing that the rep grinds in MoP were an artificial and needless barrier for people who want to play on alts, and making them less of one.<br />
<br />
@Zoma - its implemented the way it is to be simpler on programming and to avoid the nonsense behavior of someone grinding to revered on their main, grinding to revered on an alt at double speed to give the double rep buff to their main for their run to exalted.</div></div><hr />

I mean come on, you had to of known there were clearly flaws in the system in Panaria which made leveling alts only for the brave. I consider myself a pretty hardcore player and even I dreaded the idea of doing dailies for months on multiple alts.<br />
<br />
The Revered -&gt; Exalted double rep is a little weird, and I hope for future reps this is taken into consideration so Revered -&gt; Exalted doesn't just become like Friendly -&gt; Honored. Also, sucks for people who farmed the Insane, Revered -&gt; Exalted trivializes the title even further.

Making it go even faster than it is now is just plain retarded for main characters.If you're really going to argue that you run out of mindless grinds to absorb your time because a small part of reputation builds twice as fast now than before, then nothing I am going to tell you is going to be worth my time to articulate.<br />

So where's the fun in the game? You grind dailies to grind heroics to grind raids to grind more raids until you buy the new expansion that makes all your grinding entirely pointless.Its spending time with my guildies for me, usually centered around raiding and occasionally around PVP. The difference is reputations are because of their rewards almost strictly a means to another end (raids, achievement completions, etc). I'm still waiting on a logical case that says making that means more efficient somehow diminishes the enjoyment of someone else.</div></div><hr />

I forgot where they mention that mounts and pets are requirements in this game... oh yea, that's a choice you make - to do what you WANT to do to get what you WANT.

<br />
I do understand needing exalted for mounts, but the rep required for gear is completely retarded, like shadopan, by the time i ll have that rep to exalted i ll be decked in raid hc gear, what's the point of even trying to farm it ? If there was always an option to keep getting rep all day long ( mob killing like the black prince rep, or turn ins, or challenge mode rare drops that boost your rep ) it would be fine because I could actually have a use for these items, now there rep's are completely retarded and these items are useless except for those who don't raid or barely want to do dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I do see some potential problems if applied to all factions. E.g. Have 1 toon with scryers rep another with aldor rep. Then a 3rd toon can do the repeatable turnins for both sides and get exalted with both (I mean they could double the faction loss too to avoid this).<br />
<br />
We will also see if effects that increase your faction to a set amount will be affected, like when you switch between oracle and frenzy heart (or that quest that bumps you up to revered with argent dawn).</div></div><hr />

No. The only thing required for any rep was time. Rep grinding is just one big massive time sink. Doing the same 5 or so dailies every day does not take <br />
<br />
any kind of skill. All it takes is boredom. On top of that, doing the same rep grinding across 3 or more alts does not take any skill, either. It takes <br />

excessive boredom and possible addiction to WoW to want to do. <br />

The 2x rep is account wide, which you get at revered. They probably couldn't figure out how to make it so its 2x account wide EXCEPT your main (which still needs to get to exalted). So rather than just figure out how to solve the problem, they pretended its an extra bonus they were giving everyone. It's not. I guarantee you that if this unlocked when you hit exalted, there would be no 'bonus'.</div></div><hr />

Crybabies on this forum and The official forums crying hard about &quot;WAAHH GAME IS TOO EASY NOW&quot; need to step back and think<br />
<br />
Theres different Definitions of hard. theres &quot;challenging hard&quot; &quot;Nintendo hard&quot; and &quot;Artificially hard&quot;<br />
<br />
Challenging hard is what players should want. this is the intelligent way to make games hard.<br />
<br />
Nintendo hard refers to the practice of older console games to inflate game difficulty to compensate for simplistic AI; as an example, AI controlled players in the SNES mario kart being able to leap obstacles, having permanent weapons that can be thrown forward with pinpoint accuracy and getting speed boosts when behind the player.<br />
<br />
Atrificually hard refers to making games hard via artificially slowing down speed of play, such as wows reputations, console Q.T.Es and some older console games having obstacles that you were guarenteed to lose the first time through.<br />
<br />
a current example of challenging hard and Artificially hard can be seen in the Television program &quot;Wipeout!&quot;. The first Wipeout course has challenges designed to be Artificially hard, such as the steering wheel wall, the vibrating platforms, the landing areas after large jumps that raise and lower and the horizontal poles near the end of the track (all of these being human controlled and designed to intentionally cause the contestants to wipe out increases the level of artificial difficulty.<br />
<br />
the first track is more about who can swim the fastest than who can complete the course the fastest, because the first track isn't designed to be winnable. they WANT everyone to wipe out, to improve the viewing experience.<br />
<br />
on the other hand. an example of challenging hard is the final wipeout challenge, the Wipeout zone. this course is designed to be winnable, and you are encouraged to complete the final challenge without wiping out.<br />
<br />
<br />
how does this wall of text relate to wow? Reputation grinds becoming a required part of gameplay (as they are still, as Valor gear is still has reputation requirements to buy) makes the game Artificially hard, as it requires you to do the same rep grind up to revered (at least) at least X times where X is the number of characters you plan to gear for raiding.<br />
<br />
this new system falls more under the category of &quot;challenging hard&quot; where you still have to get a factions reputation to Revered before the bonus will kick in for your alts. <br />
<br />
I personally disagree with the player getting x2 rep from revered to exalted &quot;just because&quot;, but its not my call, blizzard made that choice. the rest of this rep change is, in my opinion, a great change designed to encourage players to play there alts more often.</div></div><hr />

No power is (to my knowledge) gained by getting exalted. It's pure cosmetic and fun, hence I think it's fair that it keeps the same level of difficulty. Also, as pets and mounts are account wide, there's hardly a reason to reach exalted on more than one character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im pretty sure Account wide Reputation is something that would be pretty hard to include, and would unbalance things for players who have 8 max level characters opposed to 2. the player with 8 characters could do reputation increasing dailies on every character and be revered within a week, whereas the player with 2 could take 4x longer to get to the same point.<br />
<br />
the change as it stands now does not give incerased benefit for players who have 10+ alts opposed to those with only 1. this seems, to me a better, more fair to all players, system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
&quot;Available in a future patch&quot; means 5.1 or beyond, at which point all of the rep will be either meaningless (gear rewards) or already completed account wide (vanity mounts.) Really, the only thing that this will help is profession recipes (which will also be out dated and useless) and cloud serpent training which doesn't take more than about 15 minutes a day anyway.</div></div><hr />

Last I checked AN ENTIRE FACTION THINKING THAT YOU'RE A GOD AMONG MEN was a big deal. Now according to this, it take more effort to get from honored to revered than it does from revered to exalted<br />
<br />
Honored to revered = 12000 rep, regular rate<br />
Revered to Exalted = 21000 rep, at double rate, so the same time it would take to generate 10,500 rep.<br />
<br />
Math doesn't make sense. Why would the 4th Level of a reputation be easier to obtain than the 3rd? I understand that a rep grind isn't fun for everyone, but when they mention that for Hardcore Raiding, or for PvP, they state that there are other things that you can do with the game. Rep grind isn't required in the least, there are several other options for gearing your character (Professions are a good example). Besides, Honored and Revered aren't really that hard to hit. to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you would think that at first.<br />
But they knew people wouldn't want to farm so much on so many alts, so now it's &quot; in a future patch&quot; to keep players in, and make them delay their grind, and keep their subs.<br />
Most things (like release date, patch dates, posts like this one) have an economic reason behind them, whether you like it or not. Their goal is profit in the end too.<br />
By not implementing those features on launch, they will keep players happy, and make more money in the process, probably more than if they did the changes from the start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In order for them to do this, they have to switch on a flag sitting in the back of our accounts. This flag can't specify characters, thus once the first character hits the flag (in this case, Revered reputation) then the double reputation will apply to ALL characters on the account, including the one that hit the flag in the first place. This is why they didn't just half the amount to Exalted, because they never intended us to get double during the period anyways. It's a side effect they decided just to live with when they added the ability for alts to get the bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Was rep grinding hard and took a great deal of skill and only the BESTEST HARDCORIEST PLAYARS EVAR got anything to exalted?<br />
<br />
No. The only thing required for any rep was time. Rep grinding is just one big massive time sink. Doing the same 5 or so dailies every day does not take <br />
<br />
any kind of skill. All it takes is boredom. On top of that, doing the same rep grinding across 3 or more alts does not take any skill, either. It takes <br />
<br />
excessive boredom and possible addiction to WoW to want to do. <br />
<br />
<br />
To anyone upset by this change, tell me, what exactly are you going to miss about the older rep system? That it won't take you a month to grind a faction,<br />
<br />
it'll only take 3 weeks? Lawd have murseh.<br />

Grinding rep is *currently* easy. It's just a grind. <br />

This, exactly.<br />
<br />
Beyond which.... it feels just odd that Revered -&gt; Exalted will now take less base rep gained than honored -&gt; revered. Not saying the new system is bad necessarily, but that's an oddity I think should be fixed. (Easiest way would be to drop Honored down to 10k, or bump revered up to 24/25k. Just so that the highest level of exalted actually takes the most rep, even if by a minimal amount.)</div></div><hr />

I don't see how this makes stuff &quot;easier&quot;, you still have to reach revered with your main. Once you've done that, what's the point of wasting time doing the same with your alts.<br />
<br />
For the record, if it wasn't for the gameplay and mechanics issues, I'd fully support making reputations account-wide instead of character specific.<br />

I find it's a good and bad decision.

<br />
I'd kinda have prefered a BoA 'token' or something you could buy from quartermasters that gives 5000 or 10,000 rep at an average cost each or something to a double-faction-forever, but...oh well.

<br />
Well here's the funny downward spiral you know. <br />
Pushing aside the fact whether they are fun or not the real issues I see with this is that they effectively remove any means that people play longer and as such pay more subscription fees. <br />
<br />
I guess an argument could be used that some people are willing to do the grind if it were a tad bit easier and as such this change would make people roll more alts but that is assuming someone has the paitiance to do it agian over and over agian on each character. <br />
<br />
Let us not forget that this change only reduces alt grind by half but doesnt address the very issue whether that grind is exciting or not. We're going from 10 hour of grind to 5 hour of grind.</div></div><hr />

Wow. This must have been one of the most stupid ass comment on this website. <br />
By your logic, you should not be playing the game you want to and have fun the way you want to have fun? <br />
I like to grind rep if the reward in the end is a &quot;rare&quot; achievement and the item/titel coming along is well suited for my taste. <br />
<br />
Just because a player likes getting a reward for a hard grind and feel accomplished, doesn't entitle you to tell him to reconsider how he plays the game..</div></div><hr />

Your first character hits exalted, by grinding it as it stands now, and then he can buy the tabard to send to Alts for increased rep gain. I kinda liked all the different tabards in Cataclysm. They had some &quot;flair&quot;.<br />
<br />
Actually, I like this person's suggestion the best.<br />
<br />
I think a tabard would help out the people with multiple toons who don't want to have the longer time to get to exalted, and the people who feel more accomplishment from it taking longer can decide not to use the tabard. Having more choice is good, forcing choice is not so good.<br />
<br />
But, if this is definitely going to go through, I have to agree that making it twice as fast to level from revered to exalted is just plain dumb. May as well get rid of reputations gains altogether.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps not for you. What I'm about to write might destroy your brain but there are people that do actually find grind fun? How is that possible? I stumbled upon it when I was grinding Netherwing. Yeah the activity are not spectacular, skill challenging or aspiring but that's not what it is all about. Grind is more about test of paitiance and tenacity to reach the goal, the test of character to get through what others dont have what it takes to finish. The ability to go above those smug standbys who think they could do that as well if they wanted to. <br />
<br />
Competition with others to go where others dont have what it takes to do. That's what fun about grinding. The actual stand up to the &quot;do it faggot&quot; meme. Yes Dailies or grinding gets boring and tedious after a while but you might as well say the same about anything about the game. Hell! if you go crazy about it then you might as well label everything that stands betwean you and your objective as terrible grind because you may not enjoy what you are doing and you only see the end of the journey as the only worthwhile thing in it.<br />
<br />
What I'm trying to say is that if you find something boring or tedious then perhaps it should be you who should develop a way to derive fun from it. It's not a disguised way to say &quot;man up entitled!&quot; It's really more of a good advice in life overall. In case of WoW, if you expect to be excited and entertained every single second you play... you might want to reconsider what you expect from reality.</div></div><hr />

Sorry left the bit out where I -was- hardcore raiding in TBC, I am now casual, Just because I put aside a week for launch so I could do the things I wanted to before going back to my more sporadic schedule, doesn't mean I am not casual.<br />
<br />
I log on when I can, perhaps 2-3 times a week for an hour or so. some weeks I don't log in at all. Depends how busy I am. going to that from playing 7 days a week, 9+ hours a day back in TBC, I'd say I'm casual.<br />
<br />
I don't raid anymore, the time I do spend in game, is levelling alts, collecting my pets (pre pet battles) running old content for transmog gear, or just to help friends and guildies. doing some dailies, running a dungeon now and again, annual events, farming mats for the guildies that do raid, finishing up achievements, all this can be done at a nice casual pace with the time I am able to play:)</div></div><hr />

What's the point in his other than devaluing the grind?<br />
<br />
This isn't about casual vs hardcore or anything retarded like that. Grinding rep is a nice enjoyable, steady activity that everyone can do and they're going on step further into making it into an IWIN Button situation.<br />

Fuck Blizzard, and just as I was seeing hope with Mists.</div></div><hr />

Is gaining rep the whole game?<br />
<br />
I think people want to hurry up with rep and play the rest of the game. That doesn't sound bad, does it?<br />
I like the change... it takes too long now to get the rep and I wasn't planning on doing it on alts, because it takes too much time to enjoy other things ingame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They cut it in half for alts.... so a player did the grind once at original speed (which is quite slow). The second one can do the same grind.... just for half of the time; so the grind is still there.<br />
This change is actually quite good.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can't understand is why after revered the rep-gain is doubled??????</div></div><hr />

Some old factions are really to much of a grind compaired to others. I understand you feel you are being stolen from if you just completed silverwing sentinals, but that used to be by simple with the tokens. Some factions really deserve the double rep (silverwing sentinals, hydroxian waterlord, steemwheadle cartel, bloodsail buccanears,ravenholdt etc) and some perhaps dont, like the new factions or the ones that will become very easy now. <br />
<br />
I'm really happy my alts will gain faster rep, doing dailies just as much on you alt as your main never felt right. Plus all older factions are much 'harder' to get rep with now, if you havent done them. You dont (not 100% sure) get rep from wearing Cata tabards in MoP dungeons, so you either have to do dailies, or solo dungeons. Now, you still have to do that, but less.<br />
<br />
Most recent Reputations are made to buy specific gear at the beginning of a patch or expansion. So making them more of a grind after they become useless is stupid anyways.<br />
<br />
All in all, it is just gonna be less of a grind. Reputation has always been easy mode, it just took up a lot of time.</div></div><hr />

Then its 12k rep to hit revered, and now its then only 10.5k rep to hit exalted (21000 halved due to double rep gain).<br />
<br />
It now takes longer to get from honored to revered than it does for revered to exalted?<br />
<br />
Mind boggles at the stupidity of this latest genius idea from Blizzard to cater to those entitled lazy players who don't want to actually earn anything in game anymore. They obviously made a stupid error in their design setup of reputation grinds for the expansion and are now having to try and appease the masses (also known as the whining minority), by a kneejerk hotfix, which pretty much invalidates the whole point of the reputation grind in the first place.</div></div><hr />

It's for people that have a multitude of alts. Its all very well for someone with around 2-3 alts to say they don't mind having to do that grind (and I'm not saying that is you - I have no idea how many alts you have nor do I really care). Personally I have 17 lvl 85+ toons and will be levelling 2 or 3 more during mists (two accounts, play both factions on two servers). I really enjoy levelling multiple characters, and I even don't mind doing the same quests on many characters. What I don't really look forward to however is grinding rep on all those characters. I grind rep on my achievement characters but grinding rep over and over again for weeks at a time for 17+ characters is just boring. Call me lazy if you like, but in my view this is a game and I play it for fun. Grinding is never &quot;fun&quot; for very long - its a needed chore. I do my work when I am at work... I play games to relax and take a break from work. Grinding rep on 17+ characters is work.<br />
<br />
Just my point of view - not saying anyone should share it (although I suspect a lot will - although maybe not many posting here will) :D<br />
<br />

Yay, let's cater more to the generation touched by the Sha of Entitlement. It's like you people WANT to run out of stuff to do so you can complain about how boring the game is.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion but repeatedly grinding rep over and over isn't what I would call &quot;stuff to do&quot;.. Well it IS stuff to do in the same way that doing laundry is stuff to do. It isn't &quot;fun&quot; stuff to do however. The other problem is that if rep grind is slow what will happen is people will just not bother to grind rep AT ALL - but just make do with stuff from heroics/crafted because its quicker. Also once the next content comes out the VP items will move to JP and people can get them without rep - so after the next patch rep becomes rather meaningless (apart from mounts and achievements)</div></div><hr />

<br />
*Exactly!*<br />
<br />
1.) Blizzard are smart enough to recognise that people play WoW for more reasons than grinding rep == this allows us to get on with the rest of the game. Sheesh, what a bunch of whiners; it's not like they are nerfing end game. <br />
<br />
2.) Also, Blizzard are trending differently with 'Revered &gt; Exalted' rewards; the Exalted rewards from MoP factions --with the exception of Klaxxi --are moreover aesthetic or fun [than Cataclysm] == this buff really doesn't effect your progression within WoW, it just frees your time for more meaningful things!<br />
<br />
TL:DR --Exalted MoP rewards are more cosmetic than before; Blizz want us spending our time elsewhere: not compelled to grinding rep [as per Cataclysm].</div></div><hr />

ive played a shammy on &amp; off since pretty much the begining of tbc (a priest during vanilla) &amp; not for one minute do i mind questing, but i hate the fact blizzard MAKE me do the dailies for rep. i hate doing the same old quests day after day after day just to gain rep. its bs. the tabbard system was a lot better imo, as you can spend your time getting gear for lfr, guild raids &amp; getting rep at the same time. i dont want to spend half of my gametime doing the same old shit &amp; then trying to get a few hc`s in with no guarantee of any drops</div></div><hr />

What is up with you people?<br />
<br />
The only thing rep grinding does it test your ability to repeat monotonous tasks day in day out. Nothing more. There is nothing difficult about it.<br />
So people will get a few mounts a little faster. They won't be earning VP any faster to get the VP gear from factions. The raiders will have better gear before long anyway so it shouldn't matter to them. Unless they are the elitist kind of raider of course.<br />
<br />
There is so much more to do in MoP now that making people spend weeks/months grinding out rep for mainly cosmetic things is just pointless. Do you really want to be spending all your time in game doing dailies or would you rather be doing something more interesting like trying to get that Challenge Gold achievement?</div></div><hr />

That was a really bad change if I'm understanding it right. I guess that includes old factions such as Defilers etc, which means we will see a lot more Conquerors and Defiler tabards.... Bad change.</div></div><hr />

I agree with the alts 2x fast alts, but the twice as fast to exalted is broken.<br />
<br />
Totally agree with you. <br />
The alts parts its fine. 2x rep until the lvl of rep of the revered one. But the other one has to gain the rep without so much help. 2x in rep is too much to your first toon to reach exalted with that rep.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Less rep grind = Game getting easier&quot; ??! Huh? That's your measure of difficulty and fun? Really?<br />
<br />
Lets analyse the situation for a second, shall we?<br />
<br />
I will have to grind all the reputations on my main at least once. (which I did, since I have almost all pre-MoP reps at exalted) That will clearly prove I have the incredible skillz to do same &quot;Kill XY, Loot XY&quot; dailies for weeks.<br />
Since I'm clearly such a skilled player there is really no need to prove myself over and over again on all my 6 alts. <br />
Which I wouldn't do anyway since it would take months and months (if not a year) to farm all of it on every single one of my alts.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, this &quot;fix&quot; just makes alt rep farming a bit faster. It doesn't remove it. It is still there. Unfortunately.<br />
I'd actually prefer it if it was account wide.<br />
<br />
If there's nothing for you to do except farm rep and that's your main source of fun, then there's a serious problem either with Blizzard design or with you.<br />
<br />
To summarise, for most WoW players:<br />
Current system = farm reps on main, ignore or farm 1-2 useful reputations tops on an alt<br />
New systen = farm all reps on main, consider farming a few more interesting reputations on alts<br />
<br />
Clearly this change will make the game super-easy.</div></div><hr />

I am not sure that I like the Revered thing though. I think it should be Exalted. If we earn rep at twice the rate, then the rep grind from Revered to Exalted is 10500 instead of 21000. Meh.</div></div><hr />

Yea because when people complained about nothing to do at the end of cata when new content hadn't been released in over a year, they really wanted Blizzard to introduce dailies that meant doing the same thing over and over every day. Get a clue.</div></div><hr />

Now, I have hit revered with the Klaxxi and then realized that I won't even be able to buy the legs for like two more weeks....due to the valor cap. So help me understand why we grind rep with a faction to spend valor? And if people don't like grinding dailies day in and day out, they never get to buy the gear? If you grind the rep, then you are stuck waiting to grind the VP's that you are capped on (at a lower cap than before). So yeah, I'm not really sure I understand completely the reasoning behind the whole rep/valor change right now.<br />
<br />
You grind the rep by doing dailies, get the rep, and then have to wait for enough valor to get the gear.<br />
<br />
You're capped at a total of 3000VP so even though you've grinded the rep, you can only get the legs one week and then wait again to get the waist.<br />
<br />
Or, for the people that do not like to do dailies everyday and don't care about rep, what do they spend valor on?</div></div><hr />

I was never a fan of the OCD style of gaming redoing things. Make it significant the first time over you do it. But just like in real life we tend to get faster and better at things we done already once and to reflect that properly in game is to have your alts not go through the ordeal and chore of it ALL again.<br />
So yay for halved rep gaining on alts!! Super.<br />
Though I'm dont' feel strongly about the halved revered to exalted. I think that should be the same if you do it the first time and halved for all your alts.<br />
<br />
And what is it these days with people worshipping effort, hard work, and such in games. Games are meant to be FUN and enjoyable. A little bit of grind can be required but wouldn't go as far as saying its rewarding or a prestigious achievement if you spended eons of grinding. Cereal? Rewarding is when you do something tricky that requires you to push you're coordination, hand eye motoric skills, tactical insights....engaging your brain. That's achievement in gaming. Not countless of hours of mind boggling repetitive grind. (And I have slight autistic characteristics that is prone to loving repetitive gameplay...go figure if I say its too much)</div></div><hr />
