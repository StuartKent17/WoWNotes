Update : Second update is here, also added a different color for it along with the new number.<br />

Well, they're not really patch notes, but we've seen tons of posts concerning class changes in 2.3 lately (probably because the 2.2 went live), and it's way easier to list them like patch notes instead of doing 300 blue posts report. I planned to do them myself but bumped into this post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778027018&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1) in the way, which means that these notes are heavily based on it. <br />
<br />
Anything with a (1) next to it has been updated during the first update, (2) will be the 2nd one ... etc. New updates are posted at the top of each category to make them easier to find<br />
<br />
General<br />

(3) You can now ctrl+click recipes to get a preview of the crafted item in the dressing room.<br />
(3) All items of the auction house will be sorted server side, basically it means that when you'll try to sort a particular item by price, it will sort it through all page, not only the current one.<br />
Healing Reduction effects now affect all Drain spells and abilities (i.e. Mortal Strike will affect Drain Life) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778037077&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=4#66))<br />

New relics are added to support all talent trees in patch 2.3 for Shaman, Paladins and Druids.

<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
(3) New daily quests are available in the Lower City for 5 man heroic and non-heroic dungeons (Once at a time, a bit like battlegroundw weekends, each day you will get quests for a different dungeons). The following non-heroic dungeons are concerned : Shattered Halls, Steamvault, Shadow Labyrinth, Black Morass, Botanica, Mechanar, and Arcatraz. All dungeons will get quests in Heroic mode. If you're getting the non-heroic and the heroic quest on the same day for the same dungeon, you can complete both by running it in heroic mode once. Non heroic quests will reward you with a Ethereum Prison Key (various reputation), gold, and reputation with the Consortium. Heroic quests will give you 2 Badges of Justice, gold, and reputation with the Consortium.<br />
(2) Mobs inside Sethekk Halls will now continue to award Lower City reputation all the way into Exalted. Previously they stopped giving reputation in non-heroic mode just before players hit revered.<br />
(2) The number of creatures that must be killed in the Karazhan Servants Quarters area before a miniboss spawns has been reduced.<br />
New Title - Champion of the Naaru: Awarded to those who complete the Tempest Keep attunement quest at level 70. (Won't be available anymore at lvl 80) (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=1778014822&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=19#371))<br />
Heroic Badges drop from Zul'aman and Karazhan bosses.<br />
The amount of items available from the Heroic Badges vendor has been considerably increased. <br />
New 10-Man Raid - Zul'Aman!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zul'aman<br />
Zul'Aman will be a 10-person raid zone<br />
Zul'Aman will be on a quicker reset than 7 days (some might call this &quot;casual&quot;)<br />
Zul'Aman will be MORE difficult than Karazhan and drop better loot (some might call this hardcore)<br />
Zul'Aman will feature 6 bosses and it's our goal that you can kill them all in one night -- perhaps 2-3 hour clear times (some might call this casual)<br />
Zul'Aman will not have a key requirement. Nor will it have an attunement quest\ (some might call this casual)<br />
Zul'Aman will have a VERY challenging timed quest for those who choose to participate in it. This *will be* hardcore and will be very rewarding. Players do not have to engage in the timed run (very similar to the Baron run in Stratholme)<br />
We're tuning the first boss in Zul'Aman to require less raid coordination than some other raid bosses. He will still hit very hard so you'll need to be geared properly but it won't take 15 minutes to explain the fight. It will be a simple yet challenging fight. The other boss fights get more complex and challenging from there. If players want a basis of comparison, imagine the tuning of ZA started around Nightbane/Prince difficulty and ramped up from there.<br />

Arena and personal rating requirements in 2.3<br />
Finally got some values and information about the new &quot;personal rating&quot;<br />
Well to start we'll just let everyone know that the arena RATINGS (not the number of points they'll cost) required to purchase the season 3 items will be 1850 for the weapons, and 2000 for shoulders. The rating will not be required to continue using the item, only to initially purchase it.<br />
<br />
Now, most people have expected the weapon rating since we announced it at BlizzCon, and it's a bit lower than we had initially said, but the shoulders are obviously going to raise some questions. The shoulders for any set are commonly the most visually representative, they're the most visible at any distance, and as they allow a lot of space compared to say a leg or bracer item, we commonly take them and really create something visually impressive. We want that visually impressive item to represent what a player has achieved, and so the achievement of being a contender in the arena at a higher level will be visually distinguished. The shoulders are also average in the benefit they provide, as compared to a chest or leg item for example, and without them the set bonuses can still be completed.<br />
<br />
This raises the question of a player finding a team that is of a skill level higher than their own, and simply buying the item with points they've gained at a lower rating. To restrict this we're implementing a personal rating system in patch 2.3. This is an additional arena rating that is unique to each character for each team they belong to. This rating rises and declines using the same formula as the arena team rating, but only in games that character participates in. You'll also be able to track this rating through the PvP interface. The personal rating will be used for purchasing items that require a specific rating, and also be used to determine eligibility for the end of season rewards. So, a player will have to achieve a specific rating, and not just get into a team to see the rewards that are meant to visually distinguish the high-rated players.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds daily quest<br />
We've got more details on battleground daily quests now.<br />
We have some new daily quests targeting a random battleground each day. You'll want to keep an eye out for Alliance Brigadier Generals and Horde Warbringers near your faction's battlemasters in all major capitals. The battleground daily quests will reward gold, experience, and honor. You’ll be able to begin these as soon as you’re able to enter the battlegrounds themselves. So if it’s a WSG day, and you’re level 11, you can take the quest.<br />
<br />
2.3 Fast release<br />
Zul'aman and most likely the 2.3 patch will be released fast according to all the details we're getting.<br />
Zul'Aman is done. We just need to get the raid dungeon on the public test realms, and make sure it sees extensive testing. Don't worry, it won't require the same amount of testing as voice chat. I feel few truly understand what it took to impliment voice chat, and test it properly.<br />
<br />
New Cenarion Expedition mount in 2.3<br />
Daghorn, a french Community Representative said in a blue post that a new mount will be added to the Cenarion Expedition in 2.3. It's included in the patch notes above but I guess some people will want a translation of the source.<br />
Concerning flying mount, we plan to add a new one in the 2.3 patch. It will be buyable from the Cenarion Expedition once you're exalted and it should cost about 2000 gold.<br />
<br />
1 hour delay on AH mails<br />
So ... why are the money from your AH sales delayed ? <br />
This is in addition to the mail change that we made previously in patch 2.1.3. By adding in the delay we can better track transactions to assure the legitimacy of them. This change will help us to better ensure the legitimacy of such transactions and further prevent the unlawful influx of currency into each realm’s economy. Players will still receive their items immediately, but it will take one hour for the coins to show up in your mailbox.</div></div><hr />

The Arms talent Weapon Mastery is going to be significantly changed. Instead of providing 50/100% chance to avoid Disarm effects, it is going to reduce the duration of Disarm effects by 25/50%.

<br />
<br />
You Obviously missed the point. Arena is a competitive tournament style pvp. Up until now, the good players had nothing to show off their standings. Shoulders ARE NOT the best stat item so it's more about asthetics. If you get all other 4 items, you STILL get the set bonus. It doesn't divide the arena, and the stronger doesn't get that much stronger. IF you have 4 piece and don't get 2000+ then I would question your playing skills. I like this idea. Scrubs can't just get the shoulders/glove combo first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Enhancement shaman is usefull in 25man raids, in most cases buffs up melee groups and adds at least 300dps to each melee in group. I am one of the lucky ones to raid as enhancement shaman in 25man raids.<br />
The changes in the Enhancement tree are HUGE AND OVERPOWERED!<br />
<br />
30% of attack power in spelldamage? I am currently at 2700+ attack power (at raid fully bufffed) and while dpsing (not to mention some trinket procs -&gt;3k+ap). This means i will get like almost 900spelldamage plus stormstrike? its insane as number, expect a nerf very fast. (A 15% would be more than enough imo, +stormstrike would be 18%, really good). So i can put some magma totems and laugh at our elemental shaman and his weak magma totems? :P<br />
<br />
-30% Damage while in shamanistic rage? really usefull in heroics and trash packs in 25mans, gearing a shield while aggroed, u can really pretend to be a tankoid. Me personaly i already dodge some hits, i wont die at all now :P<br />
<br />
-60% in shock mana costs if crit in melee. I like crit at least 4 times in 10 hits (which 10 hits are done in like realy few secs) it just means we have 60% lower mana shocks most of the times in raids. I will surely put 5 points in 5% more dmg from shocks :)<br />
<br />
And one thing for Engineering? The new repair bot can buy and sell? What does that mean? The old one u could sell ur stuff except repairs and buys some low engineer mats too.<br />

Hmm I think they refer more to the overall dmg bonus from your gear. Not individual items receiving the spell dmg bonus. So just to give you an idea here. Having 1300 bonus damage and 1100 bonus healing,we'll get around 330 spell dmg bonus. Eventually, as you can see. This helps much more healers, having a bonus healing of 2000 will give them 660 spell dmg. Quite something.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We're adding new relics to support all talent trees in patch 2.3 for Shaman, Paladins and Druids. In addition, (not that this will sweep you off your feet), most of the arena-system relics have been renamed so there is a more consistent naming convention.&quot;<br />

There are new Relics that are obtained from x (PvP, PvE, Both, who knows) in general.<br />

Regarding healing -&gt; damage, I believe at some point it was stated this would only be from pure +healing items, however no doubt it will be implemented badly and result in damage/healing providing more damage.</div></div><hr />

Here's what they're actually doing: items with ONLY +healing on them (healing items) will get an amount of spell damage equal to 1/3 of the healing added on to them, at no cost to the item budget. It will actually be on the tooltip. So this won't affect non-healers at all unless they're going around with pieces of healing-only gear on for god knows what reason.</div></div><hr />

When you have played every match, yes. <br />
<br />
Only the matches youself participate in are counted for your personal rating, so your personal rating could be higher than your team rating (if they lost some matches without you), but you will not gain any benefit from it when you are better than your teamrating (I hope so), because you still need a &gt;=2000 rating team and a &gt;=2000 personal rating to purchase the shoulder item.<br />

I dont think so...<br />
<br />
on an other hand, giving 33% spell power for the healing power is too huge according to me :s<br />
<br />
like said before, disc priest will be monsters... an healing drood which already VERY boring in arena will now be able to have a rather good dps... :-\<br />
<br />
for example, i have an elemental shaman which is fully stuffed arena season 2 with 823 spell damage, and a resto chaman will have 500 spell damage for 1500 healing power, not normal...<br />
<br />
I begin to seriously consider to respec heal for 2v2 and 3v3 as resto chaman will become very strong being able to heal and have a good dps also, but having to buy all the healing arena stuff... :'(<br />
<br />
33% is way too high, i think 20 or 25% should be more balanced<br />

Look mate they delayed 2.2 for SO long that I'm 150% sure they've put it and tested almost everything that they're &quot;hintin&quot; on the forums for 2.3 lately. While the hardware/software team were busy with the sound engine... I guess the programmers didn't waste time on class changes.<br />

People will always cry when they get nerfed, but if they do, there's a reason for it, you don't hear fire mages QQing about the DoTs nerf we got from resilience (mainly because it means a bigger nerf for locks, and we're very happy about that), but we do too non the less. Besides, priests are getting a buff, it's just not the one you want... well, too bad</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Fire mages don't QQ (much) about the double resilience effect on ignite simply because they aren't much affected by it... NPCs don't have resilience and no one will consider a fire build for arenas/any kind of more serious PVP. The few that do, well, they are few :D<br />
<br />
Regarding SPs, I don't know how they fare on PVP, but personally I think they should be nerfed into the ground regarding PVE. It is kind of ridiculous that the Off-spec became the main spec of a class. So buff holy priests and nerf SPs really badly (1 SP per 25 man raid, being an off spec, seems fine. 2 at most. So design their party buff/utility in order to maximize on that). Blizzard should fix that stupid TBC mistake. (note: some or most people can have a completely different opinion - I respect that :P)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only the matches youself participate in are counted for your personal rating, so your personal rating could be higher than your team rating (if they lost some matches without you), but you will not gain any benefit from it when you are better than your teamrating (I hope so), because you still need a &gt;=2000 rating team and a &gt;=2000 personal rating to purchase the shoulder item.<br />
<br />
I like this. Maybe it will prevent the team jumping some people do, provided that it will reset to 1500 every time you join a new team.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why should it reset? There is no motive to do so, quite on the opposite. Imagine that you are on a 3v3 team with a 2.2k+ rating and it collapses near the end of the season. No way you would join another team if it meant to lose your standing back to 1.5k...</div></div><hr />

Holy priests are going to be crappy as they are now even after 2.3. Wow better CoH. Wow, better lolwell. But Blizz fails to understand holy priests problem. Its the Mechanics. CoH is impossible to get in Raid enviroment (41 point talent preventing a priest taking divine spirit - the only reason of taking holy priest to a raid). Lolwell - wow more +healing. But still breaking after dmg rofl. <br />
I would really respecc holy if I had a spot in raid as a healer. Now when Blizz is nerfing Shadow and still fails to fix holy, it slowly becomes a broken class. Time to reroll soon I suppose,</div></div><hr />

You forget that you will be basically getting twice as much damage added from lightning overload since it will now proc 20% of the time but do half as much damage. It is also totally threat free damage allowing you to push out even more DPS. What I think could be interesting though is the Mental Quickness changes, if that applies to all spells then even for a full elemental geared shaman raid buffs probably will see it being worth an extra 200-250 spell damage which might arguably make it more worthwhile than speccing to the end tier elemental tree.<br />
<br />
That change alone is gonna make enhancement shamans nasty though. <br />
<br />
<br />
Some other things to note.<br />
<br />
The arena shoulders change is slightly annoying if you are an engineer since it means you have to weigh the engineering helm against the 4 piece bonus now which makes it a lot less appealing. My warrior is not too upset about that though since the devastate change should make prot grinding a lot easier. The only downside is I suspect it changes the preferred weapon speed for tanking to be using a slow 1 handed weapon instead of the currently advantageous fast weapon for small instances (I think heroic strike spam will still make the faster weapon better in raid situations). Losing disarm invulnerability on Weapon Mastery doesn't really matter. Its a loss of 70 attack power but frees up two talent points. A nerf but not exactly an earth shattering one.<br />
<br />
The paladin changes make Retribution a lot better for PvP, dont think it will make any real difference to PvE though, a bit easier to keep vengeance up while grinding but still nothing that addresses the problems of raid viability. Only downside is it makes the Retribution tree a very points heavy tree since you need an extra 6 talent points for vindication and pursuit of justice now making a hefty 54 talent points that you are going to be considering spending for Retribution pvp. The spell damage from healing change will make normal day to day life as a holy paladin much more fun. You will be able to grind and do BGs in your healing gear without being forced completely into a support role. In arena it won't make a huge difference I think since you generally don't have time to put out any DPS while healing anyway. Yes, you will sting a bit more when you use your occasional holy shock but it isn't going to be anything spectacular. It will make for more interesting paladin + enemy dpser as last 2 standing situations though.</div></div><hr />

Surely they mean the lightening bolt without talents is 2.5sec casting time, thats why the talent has been changed to be 0.5sec reduce of casting time, so you end up with 2 sec cast like as it is now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For every arena bracket you play in you have one single personal rating. Your 2on2 and your 5on5 personal rating is not linked.<br />
<br />
Example: 2on2 team with 3 players and a 2000 rating. (all three players has the FIRST requirement for buying the shoulder item, but not everyone has the second one!)<br />
<br />
Player 1 has played every match, so he has 2000 rating. (+500 compared to the 1500 at the start)<br />
Player 2 and Player 3 has an equal amount of matches, but Player 2 won a lot more games than Player 3:<br />
Player 2 will have more rating than Player 3, but not as much as Player 1 (maybe 1900, +400 compared to the start), whereas Player 3 has only 1600 points. (+100 points compared to the start)<br />
<br />
In this example only Player 1 would be able to purchase the shoulder item.<br />
<br />
If the personal point gain per win is equal to the arena points you get or if they will depend on your personal rating is not known at the moment (like when Player 3 plays with Player 1 and win in an 2000 against 2000, they would get +15 arena rating, but would both get +15 personal rating, or would Player 3 get much more out of it because his personal rating is so low?) Maybe we will know more in a few days ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In other words, the game will now calculate your rating based on games you personaly played instead to check the team rating.<br />
<br />
Like if you just joined a team with a rating of 2100 but you only played 3 games and won 15,16,17 points, your personal rating will be 1500+15+16+17= 1548 while your team rating will get to 2000+15+16+17= 2048. You wont be able to buy the shoulders because your personal rating is not high enough, even if your team rating is over 2000</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, most people have expected new flying mounts since we announced them at BlizzCon, and it's a bit later than we had initially said, but the 2000g price tag is obviously going to raise some questions. The flying mounts for any players are commonly the most visually representative, they're the most visible at any distance, and as they allow a lot of space compared to say a leg or bracer item, we commonly take them and really create something visually impressive. We want that visually impressive item to represent what a player has achieved, and so the achievement of being a contender in the gold farming arena at a higher level will be visually distinguished. The flying mounts are also average in the benefit they provide, as compared to a chest or leg item for example, and without them the journey can still be completed.</div></div><hr />

Confirmation that your personal rating will reset to 1500 when you join a new team and that you have a personal rating for each arena bracket.</div></div><hr />

Wow better CoH. Wow, better lolwell. But Blizz fails to understand holy priests problem. Its the Mechanics. CoH is impossible to get in Raid enviroment (41 point talent preventing a priest taking divine spirit - the only reason of taking holy priest to a raid). Lolwell - wow more +healing. But still breaking after dmg rofl. <br />
I would really respecc holy if I had a spot in raid as a healer. Now when Blizz is nerfing Shadow and still fails to fix holy, it slowly becomes a broken class. Time to reroll soon I suppose,<br />
<br />
Circle of Healing is a very nice spell, but you need only 1 holy priest to have it. The same goes for imp DS. I always hear priest complain about not stacking: here I see at least 3 viable specs that stack perfectly: DS build, CoH build, SP build. If you don't get a spot in a raid as a holy priest, you need to learn2play. Priest aren't spamhealbots like pallies, but we can be very effective. I'm always top3 effecive heals in 25-mans, and quite often nr 1.</div></div><hr />
