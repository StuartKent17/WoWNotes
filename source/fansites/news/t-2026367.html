World of Warcraft offers many opportunities to engage with other players in a variety of ways and to help support positive experiences in these engagements we wanted to inform you of a new silence penalty we will be implementing with the pre-expansion patch for Legion. Depending on the type of report, players who are found to be abusive in chat or engage in inappropriate chat behaviors may be silenced from engaging in certain ways within the game.<br />
<br />
The Silence Penalty<br />
Following the Legion pre-expansion, any player who is reported multiple times under the Spam or Abusive Chat categories will, after investigation, receive an account-wide silence penalty. While this penalty is active, the silenced player will find that their ability to chat with others is greatly limited.<br />
<br />
Silenced Players Are Unable to:<br />
<br />
Talk in Instance Chat (Raid, Party, and Battlegrounds)<br />
Talk in global channels that are auto joined (such as General or Trade)<br />

<br />
The first time a player is silenced, their chat will be restricted for 24 hours. This duration will double for each silence penalty received after the first, and there is no maximum. This means that players who receive multiple silence penalties may find themselves unable to chat for a very, very long time.<br />

<br />
Players will only be silenced after an investigation by Blizzard, so I tend to think that the possibilities for abuse are fairly low.<br />
<br />
I'm really excited for this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They say upon review, so there will be a human element checking out if the numerous reports are valid, so no abuse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
...Well, okay. Someone else did and I posted in his thread. Wait...was it Jaylock? Oh god...Jaylock works for Blizzard, we should have known...<br />
<br />
That being said, I think this is an awesome idea. Prepare for douchebag tears. They will be delicious.<br />
I'm looking forward to hopefully a step towards a game that isn't run by a community comparable to MOBAs.<br />
<br />
Also, this will probably be fixed by the time I post this, but you guys got it reversed I think. The official post has the restrictions flipped. I was seriously worried for a second when I saw this that Blizzard had lost their minds.</div></div><hr />

How are they going to investigate so many requests. That's a thing they say only to close our mouths if we complain about it. Who came up with this idea anyway? Seems pretty stupid honestly. I mean, I enjoy when people fight on chat sometimes. I am 100 % sure it will be abused with nonsense. Give the people power to restrict others, the people will use it. Investigate my a**, there will be too many requests to investigate. It will work like in Dota, you will be unable to do things and you will most likely not know why or when you did something wrong.</div></div><hr />

That's not really an excuse, just don't get incited. Be the bigger person, report and ignore. People who fly off the handle easily are nearly as bad as the trolls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same as now, being reported doesn't do shit unless there's grounds for it. I can't count how many times I've been reported for &quot;botting in Tol Barad&quot; by retards that don't know basic mechanics (such as not allowing yourself to go afk by moving your char every once in a while within a 5 minute window) and it has brought no form of negative results for me. A GM confirmed to me that being reported isn't enough, they'll check if there's grounds for the report and if there's none, you won't have any red flag or bad standing on your account.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like this. They should create penalties for other minor infractions instead of having temporary bans for everything. Isolating troublemakers from the specific parts of the game they're making trouble in is better than removing them from the game completely.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately assholes aren't always bad players, and it's not fair for a whole raid or RBG group to be punished because a key player got banned for saying something stupid in trade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instance chat (/i) is the chat channel that you are put into when doing LFD/LFR. You can't talk in that when silenced.<br />
<br />
Party and raid chat is different. If you manually create your party or specifically join a pre-made you can talk in those channels.</div></div><hr />

It's easy to ignore someone spamming in /y or /s.<br />

That doesn't prevent them from spamming invites or being an annoyance through other systems. This does.<br />

<br />
Let me rephrase that - if I ignore joe bloggs on one of my toons, he won't be ignored on my alts. That is - they aren't account wide in BOTH directions.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">PixelFox</div><div class="date">2016-07-12, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is fine and all, but it's going to take some time to balance and the initial period is likely to be a bit of a mess.<br />
<br />
Basically it empowers people who are butt-hurt to try to get people silenced any time they get offended. So if you try to say something humorous all it takes is a few humorless people to trigger a review and &quot;roll the dice&quot; for whether the overworked, underpaid, possibly not native language speaking reviewer decided to push the silence button or not.<br />
<br />
Trade trolling and 12 year olds who think that the word &quot;anal&quot; is the funniest thing ever invented are definitely annoying and if we end up with a quiet polite chat environment that would be awesome, but on the other hand if people have to suppress every desire to express themselves because they know big brother is watching and may slap them down with no warning then that's not a healthy environment either.<br />
<br />
Censorship, especially in the age of political correctness gone mad, is a tricky and slippery business, so this system may change nothing in terms of player happiness by angering and inappropriately punishing as many people as it makes happy.<br />
<br />
I fear that the witty and intelligent people will end up getting silenced by the young and clueless who don't get their jokes.<br />
<br />
&quot;Blizzard, that player made me feel uncomfortable so I want you to hurt them so I can feel better.&quot;</div></div><hr />

A system like this works fine in games like MOBAs and other competitive games where toxicity is fairly common, and you are stuck with the same team of people for X amount of time. But I don't see a reason why this even needs to be a thing in wow.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you get it.<br />
<br />
A troll needs to do a LOT to even get to a one month ban. If they continue being assholes after that, then a 2 month ban and so on is great. And if they want to destroy their own account, good on them. Sounds like you are worried about this hitting close to home I'm guessing?</div></div><hr />

World of Warcraft offers many opportunities to engage with other players in a variety of ways and to help support positive experiences in these engagements we wanted to inform you of a new silence penalty we will be implementing with the pre-expansion patch for Legion. Depending on the type of report, players who are found to be abusive in chat or engage in inappropriate chat behaviors may be silenced from engaging in certain ways within the game.<br />
<br />
The Silence Penalty<br />
Following the Legion pre-expansion, any player who is reported multiple times under the Spam or Abusive Chat categories will, after investigation, receive an account-wide silence penalty. While this penalty is active, the silenced player will find that their ability to chat with others is greatly limited.<br />
<br />
Silenced Players Are Unable to:<br />
<br />
Talk in Instance Chat (Raid, Party, and Battlegrounds)<br />
Talk in global channels that are auto joined (such as General or Trade)<br />
Create Calendar Invites/Events<br />
Send in-game mail<br />
Send Party Invitations<br />
Send War Game Invitations<br />
Send Invitations to Duel<br />
Update a Premade Group Listing<br />
Create a New List for a Premade Group<br />
<br />
<br />
Silenced Players Are Able to:<br />
<br />
Whisper to friends (both WoW friends and Battle.net Friends)<br />
Reply to Whispers from Non-friends<br />
Party/Raid Chat (with Invited Players)<br />
Create Parties and Raids<br />
Talk in Global Channels that have a moderator<br />
Share Quests<br />
Sign up for a pre-made group<br />
<br />
<br />
The first time a player is silenced, their chat will be restricted for 24 hours. This duration will double for each silence penalty received after the first, and there is no maximum. This means that players who receive multiple silence penalties may find themselves unable to chat for a very, very long time.<br />
<br />
Silenced players will be receiving a notification when attempting to send a message to a channel in which they have been restricted.The first time a player is silenced, their chat will be restricted for 24 hours. This duration will double for each silence penalty received after the first, and there is no maximum. This means that players who receive multiple silence penalties may find themselves unable to chat for a very, very long time.<br />
<br />
By using the in-game report tool to identify players who may be engaging in inappropriate interactions within the various channels, you’ll be helping create the type of community we all want to take part in.<br />
<br />
Finally! CELEBRATE! EVERYONE! Well, except the people who know they can't control themselves and will get silenced. Haha.</div></div><hr />

True, I love this as it now gives us more of a reason to report gold sellers (I do this anyways) and if the entire server reports them the entire account gets banned form talking and hopefully blizzard somehow make it so they can't just remake an account</div></div><hr />

<br />
You did read that the silence starts at 24 hrs right? So for someone to be silenced for a month (which you think is fair) they have to be rightfully penalized 6 times! Honestly if they keep up their attitude I'm totally fine with a longer penalty.</div></div><hr />

I've never known someone who got a suspension and didn't deserve it, and I've known enough players throughout the years to say that reports don't &quot;always&quot; end in a suspension. But let's say you're right, and this system is as abused as the current one, isn't a 24h ban from a few chats better than a 72h ban from the whole game?

This system always ends in a negative result. It is automatically worse than a suspension in that regard.

A system like this works fine in games like MOBAs and other competitive games where toxicity is fairly common, and you are stuck with the same team of people for X amount of time. But I don't see a reason why this even needs to be a thing in wow.<br />

They can't enforce long-term bans, and 24hr and 48hr bans are minor inconveniences at best. Long-term silences are a serious inconvenience that allow people to continue playing, and so Blizzard not only doesn't lose money and subscribers but can also enforce it for a wider range of people. <br />

It's right there in the original post, there will be an INVESTIGATION before action is taken. Same as now, and you're not affected in a negative way if reported by trolls since those handling these things can SEE if the report was founded or not.<br />

And I'm saying that doesn't happen often, because not even in these forums, filled with trolls and haters, it's a common topic. If there was a real, widespread issue with the report tool, there would be way, way more threads about it than there are about LFR, flying or legacy servers.<br />

I've been reported, unfounded, many times by trolls and asshats. I asked a GM if it somehow affects my accounts, cause me to come into bad standing with them and such. The answer was no, since they INVESTIGATE if there's grounds for the reports. <br />
<br />
Can they make mistakes? Sure, but then you can appeal which makes them take a second look and if they then see their error, you'll be cleared. In my 8 years of playing, I've never been wrongfully banned. Willing to bet that those claiming to be, did SOMETHING in most cases...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This x 10000, I'v sent feedbacks to Blizzard throughout the years asking for a bigger ignore list ever since they modified the ignore function for dungeon queues to avoid being placed in the same group as certain players again (I believe it was somewhere in WotLK expac). <br />
<br />
Since it turns the ignore function into a tool for quality control, it makes only sense to increase the max number it can contain by order of magnitudes(I wish).<br />
<br />
There's always going to be a certain percentage of players that are going to be bad apples whether the player base is at 300k or 12 millions, I think the limit should reflect that reality at least. Instead of having an arbitrary number (50?) that doesn't take in consideration population numbers.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe Blizzard doesn't want to allow people to spew shit on their private platform? You're not entitled to say what you want on someone's private video game. Comparing it to Hitler is not only godwin as fuck but these situations are nothing alike. Hitler didn't ban people from spamming trade chat with shit jokes. <br />
<br />
Nobody relies on World of Warcraft's trade chat to provide them with a platform for their political expression. If you open up trade chat, call someone a nigger faggot, then spam anal jokes, expect to be silenced for being an idiot. No normal player has anything to fear from this feature.</div></div><hr />

There IS no &quot;freedom of speech&quot; in game or on the Blizzard forums except what they allow.

You don't like it, you're free to play someone else's game, or even design/build your own.<br />

<br />
For those who think this'll be abused? I'm sure it will be but that'll entirely depend on whether or not Blizzard is able to properly investigate the reports. False positives slip through everything already so I'm sure that won't change but to think that every player out there has a Twitter army of level 1 characters or are multiboxers ready to fire off reports is a little bit much. All it takes is cross referencing the reports along with looking at your character's chat and they'll know if you're being a dick or not. If anything, those who create false reports should get the same treatment as those who are properly being reported.</div></div><hr />

No because then the game would have to be rated 18+. It is a game designed for teenagers get over it. Just because you implement a server that only adults can access does not mean the age rating of the game can be kept the same.</div></div><hr />

It's a 24 hour chat ban, doubling every time. <br />
<br />
If you are the one guy who improperly gets silenced, it's what? 24 hours of inconvenience? We're not talking about a permaban. We're not talking about capital punishment.<br />
<br />
The system would have to be completely and utterly fucked for you to get banned enough times for it to cause a big issue for your account. And if it's THAT fucked, there will be a huge backlash.

Considering &quot;adults&quot; are overrepresented, this would probably not make even a fraction of difference... Going by statistics, whenever you encounter a shithead in wow, chances are it's a male over the age of 21. <br />

It's not likely that they will check up everyone that gets enough reports. I really doubt Blizzard has the manpower to do so.<br />

Exactly. People capable of giving criticism without stooping to reasoning such as &quot;only fanboys disagree with my OPINION!&quot; shouldn't feel at risk.<br />

Not that giving criticism in-game in chat channels is much more than a waste of time anyway... constructive criticism does more good on the official forums, via the Suggestion form and such.</div></div><hr />

It depends on how Blizzard will react and control the reports. <br />
<br />
Example: trolls will report people for LFM,guild recruits and no matter how many reporters these people should not be silenced. <br />
I would only report gold seller probably and toxic people, but i never really look in general chats anymore so they don't really bother me. <br />
<br />
I hope this system can't be abused by big grps of trolls that just wanna mess with people.</div></div><hr />

How will the game punish those who silence people without no reason? 48hrs ban? Because without that I know some people who will use their 4-7accounts to silence people all day every day.<br />
<br />
It fits here too: ”Any society that would give up a little liberty to gain a little security will deserve neither and lose both.”</div></div><hr />

What is abusive chat?<br />

Is it me calling someone a racist name?<br />

What is Abusive Chat?<br />
<br />
1. yes<br />
2. depends on the tone you are using with the person<br />
3/4. Depends on the nature of the joke.<br />
<br />
it all comes down to &quot;just don't be an ass&quot;. Saying &quot;you all fucking suck&quot; is bad. &quot;kill yourself faggot&quot; is bad. &quot;wow learn to play u shitty hunter&quot; is bad. &quot;Look into some guides, you're playing bad&quot; is fine. Racist jokes might be debatable and a grey area, but you can simply not do that. &quot;Anal [Shadow Infusion]&quot; is IMO fine, but might be debatable; it would probably be fine. Unlike &quot;Why don't you [Feign Death] but do it for real&quot; which would be bad(inciting suicide). &quot;Buy character boost for 100USD&quot; would be really bad too.<br />
<br />
There's very very little grey area for &quot;abuse&quot;. Don't be an ass and you'll be fine, really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could reasonably think that a person who's silenced will not make any further reports come in and that with the scum being filtered out that the number of reports will slowly go DOWN not up. <br />
<br />
It will take a few days/weeks of more dilligence to stay on top of the reports, but eventually as you filter out the people that were causing most of the reports you should be able to spend the same amount of time or less and get through the reports that are made.</div></div><hr />

Spamming.<br />
Harassment.<br />

This isn't just an automated system, our Game Masters will review under the same rules they always have.<br />

Thats another major problem with it, if it would say &quot;spam&quot; and &quot;insults&quot; then it would be much clearer, but &quot;abusive&quot;? Hurting someones feelings? Its just such a broad wording that any GM could do what they want to do and justify it with these rules, someone said he does not like this Specc? Well, i love it and him saying this hurts my feelings, for this he should be punished.</div></div><hr />

It is intended to be reviewed by a human before being passed. Whether the method you described would work will depend on if the ban is instant upon receiving X number of reports, or if the reports simply bump it to the top of the human reviewer's priority list.<br />

If there is no automated ban in place at all then this method would be entirely ineffectual.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. It's pretty clear from all the concerns in this thread, that a lot of people don't quite understand what's acceptable or not... Telling a stranger in a group that he's &quot;Shit and a moron!!!&quot; because he's really playing badly, does not equal constructive criticism and feedback. Telling a stranger &quot;What you are doing isn't optimal/correct, if you do it this way you'll get better results!&quot; however, is. And if the stranger gets salty and reports you over that, you won't be in danger.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The terms of service pretty much layout what would be considered abusive chat. So yes any using racial slurs would do it.. jokes could do it if it was vulgar obscene, hateful, or sexually explicit. <br />
<br />
B. Rules Related to &quot;Chat&quot; and Interaction With Other Users. Communicating in-game with other Users and Blizzard representatives, whether by text, voice or any other method, is an integral part of the Game and the Service and is referred to here as &quot;Chat.&quot; When engaging in Chat, you may not:<br />
(i) Transmit or post any content or language which, in the sole and absolute discretion of Blizzard, is deemed to be offensive, including without limitation content or language that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, hateful, sexually explicit, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable, nor may you use a misspelling or an alternative spelling to circumvent the content and language restrictions listed above;<br />
<br />
(ii)	Carry out any action with a disruptive effect, such as intentionally causing the Chat screen to scroll faster than other users are able to read, or setting up macros with large amounts of text that, when used, can have a disruptive effect on the normal flow of Chat;<br />
<br />
(iii)	Disrupt the normal flow of dialogue in Chat or otherwise act in a manner that negatively affects other users including without limitation posting commercial solicitations and/or advertisements for goods and services available outside of the World of Warcraft universe;<br />
<br />
(iv)	Sending repeated unsolicited or unwelcome messages to a single user or repeatedly posting similar messages in a Chat area, including without limitation continuous advertisements to sell goods or services;<br />
<br />
(v)	Communicate or post any user's personal information in the Game, or on websites or forums related to the Game, except that a user may communicate his or her own personal information in a private message directed to a single user;<br />
<br />
(vi) Harass, threaten, stalk, embarrass or cause distress, unwanted attention or discomfort to any user of the Game;<br />
<br />
(vii)	Participate in any action that, in the sole and absolute opinion of Blizzard, results or may result in an authorized user of the Game being &quot;scammed&quot; or defrauded out of gold, weapons, armor, or any other items that user has earned through authorized game play in the Game;<br />
<br />
(viii)	Communicate directly with players who are playing characters aligned with the opposite faction (e.g. Horde communicating with Alliance or vice versa); or<br />
<br />
(ix)	Impersonate any real person, including without limitation any &quot;game master&quot; or any other Blizzard agent or employee, nor may you communicate in the Game in any way designed to make others believe that your message constitutes a server message or was otherwise posted by any Blizzard agent or employee.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, you're pretty wrong. I work as a programmer, and I specialize in keeping social spaces 'clean' of garbage posts. I can tell you without a doubt that this system will actually improve ticket times. Bad apples are bad apples, and as you remove them, the purity goes up. Over time people begin to recognize quality, and a lack of disturbances, this creates a culture where people that were on the fence polluters - will just simply not pollute.<br />
<br />
If you make it so that the eyes in the sky are always watching, always waiting, then your misbehaving people simply go somewhere else. It does work; and it will make for a more serene experience in World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Incorrect. Because they come back on a worthless account and don't care about future penalties.<br />

<br />
Well, they said &quot;too many reports&quot;. Sounds like something unrelated to investigation.</div></div><hr />

No different from right now. If there's no ground for the report, you're in no danger. If your idea of &quot;asking imbeciles to play better&quot; contains personal attacks and profanity, then you are in danger. And rightfully so. L2GF without a tantrum applies, which you'd think would be a long overdue lesson to learn as an adult...</div></div><hr />

I dunno. Probably because you like their games I guess? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

&quot;Okay, I think I know what we did wrong. We stood in the fire too long and lost too many people. So let's try again and everyone be a bit more mindful of our positioning.&quot;<br />

Regular GMs have to investigate/verify every report right now. This doesn't change the report tool, just the punishment.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's quite active atm thanks to the influx of players leveling, at least across the servers I play on.</div></div><hr />
