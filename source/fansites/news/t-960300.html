For quite some time now, players have been asking for a location in which to store important keepsakes including treasured armor sets, unique quest rewards, and gifts from friends, as well as other valuable items they’ve collected on their journeys throughout Azeroth.<br />
<br />
This is a feature we’ve wanted to add to the game for a while, so we’re excited to announce that, thanks to the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of the Ethereals, a new long-term storage option will soon be available to completionists and collectors alike.<br />
<br />
Void Storage<br />
<br />
In patch 4.3, characters of all levels will be able to take advantage of a new technology known as “Void Storage”, which will open up 80 slots of long-term storage space. Void Storage vaults will be available in both Stormwind and Orgrimmar and can be accessed simply by speaking with your local Vaultkeeper.<br />
<br />
A variety of items can be placed into Void Storage — including soulbound items and Battle.net Account Bound items — making it the perfect location to store trophies from past conquests, as well as armor you may want to hold onto for Transmogrification. So, if you’ve been looking for a good home for those old tier sets or your vanity holiday items, Void Storage is it! And it’s as easy to use as dragging and dropping.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
In return for this unique service, the Ethereals will require a small fee for each item deposited into or withdrawn from their Void Storage apparatus. Multiple items can be added and removed at once, and the cost of each transaction will be display at the bottom of the screen, updating dynamically as you select additional items to deposit or withdraw. Once an item is placed into Void Storage, it can remain there indefinitely for no additional cost.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
It’s important to note that the goal of Void Storage isn’t to be a second bank, but rather a place where players can safely store items they wish to keep for the life of the game, either for sentimental or aesthetic reasons. Since this particular storage option isn’t really intended for belongings that you’d use a regular basis (like your current set of raiding gear, for example), any item placed in Void Storage will be stripped of all its enhancements, including enchants, gems, sockets, and reforged stats. This will help us reduce the impact such storage can have on the game servers, and ultimately allows us to provide a lot of long-term storage space with minimal impact on everyone's play experience.<br />
<br />
Bag Search: Find What You Need, When You Need It<br />
<br />
Now, you might be thinking, “Alright, those Ethereals are pretty nifty, and having more storage is great! But what about actually being able to find what I own? Do you know how long I looked for that one stack of Papa Hummel’s Pet Biscuits? Like, a year. Okay, maybe 15 minutes. Either way, not even a tiny, delicious fat baby raptor is worth that kind of effort, and I love fat baby raptors.”<br />
<br />

<br />
Never fear, fellow tiny-limbed-corpulent-dinosaur enthusiast! We’ve got you covered. In addition to Void Storage, we’re also adding a bag search feature in 4.3 that will allow players to search for items within their bags and bank space with just a few keystrokes.<br />
<br />
Integrated directly into the bag and bank UI, this new search feature will be incredibly quick and easy to use. To find an item in one of your bags, in your character’s personal bank, guild bank, or Void Storage vault, you’ll simply type the name of the item — or a word in the item’s name — into a small search box located near the top of your main backpack and your open inventory will be filtered accordingly. Only the items that match the word or name you’ve entered will display, making it easier than ever to find exactly what you need, exactly when you need it.<br />
<br />

<br />
Please keep in mind that both Void Storage and the upcoming bag search features are still in development, so their functionality may change before release. We’re very excited to be offering both of these inventory management features and will be providing more information as the development of patch 4.3 continues.<br />

Curse Party at Blizzcon 2011!<br />
On Friday, October 21st from 8 PM to 2 AM on the 2nd floor of the Hilton hotel next to the Anaheim Convention Center, Curse will be celebrating BlizzCon with fellow gamers and VIPs. The party will feature an open bar, swag, live DJ, giveaways, etc!<br />
<br />
There will be several VIP’s in attendance including Felicia Day and several members from the cast of The Guild, several of your favorite WoW community members, bloggers, and more!<br />
<br />
At this point I'm assume that most of you know The Guild (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guild) but if you don't, here is the first episode of the fifth season. <br />

Look again.<br />
<br />
100g to withdraw/deposit 1 item. 1000g initial fee.<br />
<br />
I will NEVER EVER EVER use this feature.<br />
<br />
The restrictions on transmogrifier + the outrageous price to store our sentimental items = I'm VERY close to leaving WoW. Nothing has wowed me lately. It's all been poorly executed.<br />
<br />
In other words, you have a full bank of sentimental gear.<br />
<br />
Buy Storage, deposit all 80 pieces.<br />
<br />
Goodbye 9000g.<br />
<br />
Oh, you want to withdraw X amount for transmogrifying then re-deposit then? Goodbye another 1k+ gold. Repeat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mammoth</div><div class="date">2011-08-18, 04:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its absolutely great. I'm sure many players are going to regret the losses they've had to make in the last few expansions while waiting for this, but from now on these losses will not have to be made.<br />
<br />
As for paying to deposit, its a good idea. From the sketchy impression I get of the implementation, they don't want too much put into storage. The cost just stops players from using it as a secondary bank. For my old gear I want to keep, it is well worth the price. Not to mention the natural advantage of gold sinks for the economy.<br />
<br />
The other point I can see people complain about is the gems and enchants. But this is also completely reasonable from Blizzards point of view. If you store an item, they just have to store the ID, that is one integer number. As soon as you add 3 gems and an enchant you've got 4 integers to store. By stripping the improvements from your items they've reduced the amount of memory it'll take to store all the players crap by a factor of 4. Good for them, I have no complaints since we're reaping the rewards of having new storage space.</div></div><hr />

The idea of storing 'nostalgia' items 6 years into a game just feels a little back to front. Sadly a lot of players have been forced to delete nostalgia items a long time ago because a feature like this was always missing from the game. Now all of a sudden it's possible AND we can now search our bags? I'm sure this will sound like QQ and I should just be thankful, and I am, I truly am, I just wish they'd done this oh.. about 5 years ago.<br />

Exactly this. Over half my bank is currently filled with Tier items, gear sets, and holiday stuff. That is almsot 3-4 bags of 20 slots, that is a lot of stuff to put into void storage. With 1k gold just to access it, and another 100g per item, so 100g x 80 or so items. That is a lot of gold to store stuff. I understand if you are only putting in 1-3 items, or taking out 1-3 items. But if you have a set to take out to transmogrify that is at around 4-6 pieces, so 400-600g to take out, and the same to redeposit once you are done.</div></div><hr />

I've deleted items in the past that would have been perfect for this type of things. Even just when running old raids for achievements or fun and that something of a tier set dropped on my newer characters. In light of this I would have never gotten rid of those pieces but at the time I did not see the point in keeping 1 or 2 pieces of gear for the sake of having it. This being on characters I didn't have back in vanilla and even the ones I did have back then I didn't keep the tier sets for bragging rights as I did not see the point. Now however together with the option to change the way gear looks I wished I had kept my mage tier 1,2 and 3 sets, back to farming them I guess apart from tier 3 which is no longer obtainable... good job blizz, just a few years too late. In fact I don't even have any of my ICC gear left, where was the point in it. I know some people might do but I never saw the point of it... damn you blizzard!TL;DR yay finally... few years to late blizz I don't have any old tier sets anymore to dump in voidstorage as a goldsink</div></div><hr />

They need to take a tip from Bagnon and make it so that all of your bags are in one, nice, neat window. And oh, Blizz and their goldsinks. While I don't necessarily disagree with their decision to charge us for depositing/withdrawing from Void Storage - I do think they made the cost a bit steep. Granted this is still in development they'll probably find themselves lowering the costs. If not before the launch, then not too long afterward. Now...how about that cross-realm BoA? lol /wishfulthinking</div></div><hr />

And there are individuals (like me) who has so much vanity gear that it takes up almost my entire bank which could be used to...oh I don't know...store items to work the auction house? <br />

SO SOOOOO worth the 1000g + deposit cost.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I agree. I've gotta hope that you pay the fee once to deposit an item and then don't have to pay it again if you withdraw and deposit again, but that's probably me being optimistic.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. I was hoping it would be a one-time fee for the storage, but... yeah. And anyway, the search option won't replace Altoholic when the addon updates for 4.3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You did notice that the &quot;gold&quot; is also a pixel right? lol<br />
<br />
They'll charge for it so it won't be another bank. If you need the service, you just need to be smart to manage what will go there, what will not go there. You're not throwing something there that you usually take back every month or something like that...<br />
<br />
You'll prefer to throw itens there that you just want to store (like sets for transmogrief. I doubt we'll have to put it in our bags to use the service) and not use or itens that you use like once per year...</div></div><hr />

You can't do that with most holiday items, or Tier sets. They are all soulbound. And you are right a few thousand gold isn't a lot to some people, but it is to others who would love to use this feature. Some may not be able to because they don't play the AH, or farm for hours. Dailies don't give that much gold anymore with inflation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
100g to withdraw/deposit 1 item. 1000g initial fee.<br />
<br />
I will NEVER EVER EVER use this feature.<br />
<br />
The restrictions on transmogrifier + the outrageous price to store our sentimental items = I'm VERY close to leaving WoW. Nothing has wowed me lately. It's all been poorly executed.<br />
<br />
In other words, you have a full bank of sentimental gear.<br />
<br />
Buy Storage, deposit all 80 pieces.<br />
<br />
Goodbye 9000g.<br />
<br />
Oh, you want to withdraw X amount for transmogrifying then re-deposit then? Goodbye another 1k+ gold. Repeat.<br />
<br />
You're going to leave WoW because a new feature that you've been fine without all this time is too expensive? It's not required, and the price will go down. Just like epic flying, just like dual-spec. They're premium features for those that really want it, then the gold price drops later to be more accessable. You're not going anywhere, you're going to keep playing. Because the people that care enough to get mad at something like this are the ones that are deepest into the game. Go buy another time card. The people that will use this (the type to hold on to useless items) aren't the ones that will leave that easily. You're mad just to be mad. For the cost, this isn't worth it to me. I may find some things to throw in there when it gets dirt cheap in 6 months.</div></div><hr />

They could have just increased bank slots it seems. I'm hoping some new features are unveiled down the line that truly make it it's own unique storage system.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess its just a goldsink for the rich users that can afford horde tons of items, if you have no gold you are likely not to be so full on soulbounds you need to have more storage. But then for goldsinks, I prefer they added a small fly-speed upgrade for some ridiculous price again</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess I'd say that it's important to remember that WoW has millions of subscribers, with millions of goals and desires. Blizzard also has its own set of goals and requirements. <br />
<br />
Just because Blizzard is doing something in a way that you don't agree with or like, doesn't mean they're doing a bad job. They may just have goals or limitations that don't line up perfectly with your desires. Considering that this game is more than half a decade old, I would argue that they're doing a great job. You just can't please all the people all the time. The faster everyone realizes that, the faster we can get back to discussing interesting things instead of arguing on the internet. <br />

The gear sets while in the void storage can be used for transmogrification. Not to mention 9000g for everything isn't really a big deal to anyone with an 85 on that server.

It's a feature people wanted, just as they like a tabard feature similar to the titles drop down box. People want to free their bag-space, but for free. This kind of money sinks are just retarded. They say they listen to the community and they implement the idea, but at some point they completely change it to be less enjoyable for the masses. <br />
It should be free to deposit/withdraw items, you should pay an initial fee to unlock it, could be 5k 10k or 15k but after that you shouldn't have to pay any fee - why does everything have to be a money sink, really? It's like with everything other vanity like that was fun but nerfed, like the faded wizzards hat, dancing while in combat/attacking, they take everything that is &quot;fun&quot; bug-fix it and we get stuff that is not fun at all anymore. <br />
<br />

Gold sinks aren't retarded, they're what keep inflation to a minimum. What's retarded is the amount of gold you can get in the first place. By level 85 you have upwards of 6k gold, and it only takes a week or two to level a character (2-3 days /played). The only gold sink they added so far in Cata to stem the tide was the Vial of the Sands. With everyone doing the TB dailies for 6 months, and now the molten front dailies, we needed another gold sink. You could argue that reforging is a gold sink, but unless you're a hardcore raider, you don't use it enough to make a big difference.<br />

The only tier gear you can't get is T0...look-a-likes are available from BC normal dungeons, T3 copies are T7, even if they aren't exact. At any rate personally I held onto every piece of gear I cared about having for nostalgia sake. Only things I'm missing are easy to get back, (T5 and 4).

<br />
Guilty as charged. My wife and I have a alt guild with 5 tabs, but this will be needed for the Soul Bound stuff. I plan to dump all the old gear I have left (vendored most :( ), and I will farm the sets/gear I want. I have no issue withe the price and plan on filling it up. I will be one that will change my looks all the time, from the starter gear to some of the cool set gear.<br />
<br />
How do people not have the gold to use this? you can make like 500 G/day from dailies. Run a heroic and make over 100 gold. I am swimming in gold and don't even play AH.<br />
<br />
Whatever Blizz does is:<br />
OMG too EZ<br />
OMG too Hard<br />
OMG Catering to Casuals<br />
OMG 9000 gold for 80 extra spots<br />
OMG I want all the armor classes<br />
OMG you mean I have to own the stuff to wear it?<br />
OMG now I can't see who has bad gear before I gank<br />
OMG I want to look special so gimme<br />
OMG I want to look special so don't give<br />

<br />
While more bank-space is nice and welcomed, this entire system is a complete and utter letdown. I'm willing to bet a huge majority of people were hoping this was going to be a system of actual Account-Bound-Item Transfer. Something they've claimed to be working on for years. Instead of introducing that, we get this garbage. What the fuck is going on at Blizzard?<br />

Maybe those are the prices that will go live, but I have a feeling those are just set there right now for two reasons:<br />
<br />
1) Since they showed them, maybe Blizz wants to get some feedback from the community about the potential cost.<br />
<br />
2) Maybe they picked nice round numbers like 100 and 1000 for testing purposes.<br />
<br />
Either way, complaining about a new feature, that is 100% optional, is something people have been asking for years, and that is not even in the game yet is just....... STUPID.</div></div><hr />

I see you're a warlock. <br />
<br />
I'm gonna lay down $50 and guess you're a tailor, allowing you to create the largest bags while charging an arm and a leg for them on the AH.<br />
<br />
I have absolutely no problem with the initial charge. 100g per transaction (if it sticks) is downright ridiculous. Not everyone that plays this game lives in their momma's basement or is a forever alone (like wow players are stereotyped) and has all the time in the world to gold farm or want to spend the majority of their game time doing so, for that matter. I spend the majority of my time in real life having to make money to survive and maybe, just maybe have enough to get luxury items and it's annoying. I'm sick of having to be nickel and dime'd inside a leisure game also.<br />
<br />
I do agree with you that it should definitely be a way to xfer account bound items cross realms. The fact that you still can't is ludicrous at best.</div></div><hr />

It is not hard to comprehend!<br />
<br />
That wasn't what we were referring to. Several posts on this thread thought that every time you open up the storage it would cost 1000g. As for the 100g deposit/withdrawal. Good. It's a gold sink. It's meant to store old tier that you keep just to say you have it. If you're going to swap out the gear often, then keep it in your normal bank. Not hard.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. I already have two alt-guilds just to store items, but this idea of void storage is not comming to me. If i want another storage, i will buy more tabs, even tho they cost 5k now or something along these lines. Sb items can be stored in regular bank with that freed space.</div></div><hr />

Good luck storing your soulbound items in your alt's guildbank...</div></div><hr />

Listen, Void Storage is something that's only going to appeal to certain people, i.e. collectors. I know for me, I can't use the bank for tradeable items because my bank is full of soulbound items I have collected over the years. Silly as it may sound, there's a lot of items that have sentimental value to me, and thus far, the only place to store such things has been in the bank. If the people are worried about the price, don't be. 4.3 isn't due out for months, do people honestly believe those will be the final prices? I know people want it to be free, but as Blizzard said, it's not meant to be &quot;extra storage.&quot; Rather, it's meant as sort of an &quot;attic&quot; where players can put old things so that it doesn't clutter up the space they have. Just because you expected something different (and quite honestly, I think cross-realm storage is a very bad idea) doesn't make this bad. Get over yourselves.</div></div><hr />

Out of 10 characters I can see maybe using this for one of them (my main) who collects all the holiday stuff and whatnot. That's it. I have to agree with Tyranic above. They could have just added another bank slot and accomplished the same thing. I want the equivalent of a guild bank, accessible by all characters on an account (even if it is restricted to the same realm for now). Surely that can't be so hard.</div></div><hr />

Only in SW and OG will be those Etherelas? What is the point of having other cities anyway? Both SW and OG are clusterfucked by millions players, while other cities are left deserted. Blizz should show respect to people who don't have at least a decent gfx card for running WoW. <br />
<br />
Another point which no one mentioned. As it's now planed player will pay 100G to a NPC that items WILL LOSE all gem(s) and enchantment(s) any anything else on the item. <br />
<br />
For fuck sake, Blizz! Why not implement the exact the same functionality to the corresponding profession? JCs should have an option to destroy the gems in the gear (Without the need to put new a gem in the socket!). Enchanters should have the option to remove their own enchants! And so on and on .... <br />
<br />
Another point is that BoA items should be free to put in and out of Void Storage. <br />
<br />
And another FFS. There are still soulbound token items which were used for buying stuff from different older (BC and classic) factions. Actually these are still used for exact same thing. They still occupy slots in bank. Those token items along with BoA should be sharable across all characters and all realms anyway.</div></div><hr />

These kind of changes are almost predictable. I don't want to turn this into a debate about blizzards subscriber loss but I have argued against blizzards method of catering to the folks that don't join forums. yes that is probably well over 70% of the player base but heres the thing. We are talking about people who don't take wow outside of wow ever...thus they are not the ones selling the product. we are. and as they moved their marketing strategy away from finding out what us forum goers and website runners etc. They start taking their patch ideas from thier nifty little retention department. The people that read all those &quot;other reason&quot; boxes when you close your account, the people that are on the phone when you call to cancel your account. This team is designed to prevent loss and it is not a far stretched theory to say that many of the casual players have left the game, due to high initial dungeon difficulty, high initial raid difficulty. and even some more difficult than in the past. Which brought to life patch 4.2 with a massive daily chain, an easier raid instance. Now if you were that group of people what would happen with a massive income(from dailies) and a raid that is more accessible than ever. Now what to you do. you did all your dailies that in the end make you feel like you just completed questing. you have a massive gold surplus. and little to do? Its time for a new raid that will attempt to draw everyone in. and a massive gold sink to get rid of some of that nasty weight in your pockets. oh and also. To give you a wealth of things to do by inticing you to do older content again to go get that tier 1-12 for your new transmorgify ability, and a place to store all that fancy stuff.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">endersblade</div><div class="date">2011-08-18, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's what I think they should do.<br />
<br />
For the first, say, month of this being out, depositing should be free. Pay the 1k to open it, then you are allowed to deposit up to 80 times without incurring a fee. Withdrawing still costs money, and depositing more than 80 times will cost money. That gives everyone a chance to move whatever they need to immediately.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have a bank char and two guild banks to store stuff in. All of my chars' banks are available for anything already bound, and anything non-bound goes to the bank char or one of the guild banks. I really won't have a need for this void storage; it's not what I was expecting. I was hoping it was going to be storage specifically for armor sets; a way to keep track of them, from a collector's point of view. Not just another generic storage space that costs money. Also, if they're going to charge us to put stuff in there for use for the transmog, we should be able to access it FOR the transmog without having to withdraw it. Kind of defeats the purpose otherwise if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not sure what angle you're going for here. 100g per thing you stick in that storage adds up to a lot, quickly. If it was 100g every transaction, including bulk transactions, I could almost see what it is you're trying to get across. 100g per thing, with 80 slots, considering how much crap some of us &quot;casuals&quot; can collect over the years is a small fortune. I can't personally see myself using a system that would cost me 8000g to fill up, which I could do and still have items left over in my bank. But hey, what would I know? I'm just a fucking casual.</div></div><hr />

Why would you need the items to be enchanted or gemmed? Old tier sets are for vanity reasons, not for the stats they have. If it's some weapon that you prefer to have an ecnhant on for the looks, then don't put it in void storage.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moglock</div><div class="date">2011-08-18, 11:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the main reason this took so long to implement was that Blizzard is concerned about the stress it will put on servers. This is why there is a restriction on what can be deposited and the stripping of any enchants, gems, etc. Think of it as Amazon Cloud vs what iCloud will do. Amazon will store your music for streaming but you have to upload old music to it. Each person has their own storage even though the exact same song could be on thousands of accounts, and stored thousands of times. Wasting space. iCloud will simply allow access to songs you have. That means the song only needs to be stored once (maybe more than that to allow streaming for multiple users) but it will stream to anyone with the rights. So basically there will be one Tier 3 Warrior helmet taking up server space that any Warrior (that put it in Void Storage) has access to. If you withdraw it, you get a copy of the original. This will save them space so they don't have to have multiple copies of the same item but with different enchants, gems, &quot;created by&quot; tags, etc. This is the only way they could come up with a tabbard and old gear storage without bogging down the servers. So take it as is or don't use it. Personally, why someone would care if an old item that they never use due to currently horrible stats is enchanted or not. Also, it isn't as thought the enchants are gone. You can always re-enchant if you really wanted to. Finally, I like the idea of Void Storage and Transmorgrifying. The trans alone will give reason to go farm those old raids and instances. TBC had some awesome Lock gear! I also like the restrictions on gear-types, having to possess the gear, and not allowing legendaries. All make perfect sense to me.</div></div><hr />

Never say never. They will probably introduce this in the future. I couldn't imagine the coding needed to do this in the first place but I'm sure Legendaries are special as far as a weapon.<br />
<br />
And to all the QQers. This is no different then repairing or reforging. The reason why it costs gold is because it's not meant to be a secondary storage. It will clear out regular banks and finally add customization which I'm sure is just a stepping stone for much greater things.

I actually went into comments to comment on that. I found that funny. It took 6 years for Blizzard to think of something like this (bagsearch), while Rift had it at launch.<br />
<br />
I saw my gf play Rift, and i have to say, im slightly impressed over it, not quite my cup of tea. BUT, Rift had so many small details that annoy a living fuck out of you in WoW. It's like as if Rift was made by some players that played WoW for years on end, got tired of bullshit, and made their own game filtrating all the annoying stuff from WoW :p</div></div><hr />

You cannot. This would amount to cross-server heirlooms, which is not a feature in the game right now and won't be in for the foreseeable future. If you put stuff in your bank, only that character can access the contents (from what I understand).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only problem here I can think of are the prices. 1k to unlock it? And if what some people are saying is true about 100g per item, that does seem very overboard. Sure, 100g is easy to come across and for a lot of people 1k is nothing at all for a one-time payment, but not for everyone. Plus I want to know WHY we have to pay to store items in the void storage, when I could just stick them in my bank for free. If we have to pay to withdraw and deposit all our items, I'll probably end up using it just to keep my heirlooms together in one place when they're not being used by characters, considering you'll take them out to level a character, which will be a while, and then deposit them again when you're done leveling, so you're not paying to withdraw/deposit all the time. Although looking at the price of dual-spec these days, I wouldn't say such a hefty price will last long.</div></div><hr />

And another thing, do not create rifts in WoW, as i saw some mention it.

I agree people always get upset when every patch is announced. Although, this time there is cause for alarm. The last 2 expansions they released the main boss early. In BC they ended up releasing a whole new tier to tide people over. In Wrath they didn't have the man power due to people being pulled by other games and working on the next expansion. They making the same mistake again and I jhope people are ready to raid Deathwing for a year or more, well unless 1 boss raid for 6-8 months can hold you over.<br />
<br />
People should be mad, they said they were going to release small patches in between major raid content with more quality of life fixes and other stuff. I guess it turned out that they just didn't know WTF to do for patch 4.1 so they just lied out right and we get an expansion with the least raid content of just about any in existence. Are they short staffed? Maybe, is that our problem? No, we pay a subscription fee so they can hire more people and guarantee quality content on the other games that WoW players might not even touch. They knew about all these games ahead of time and had time to start hiring quality people overtime. They didn't hire enough maybe. Why am I being punished due to Blizzards incompetence. <br />
<br />
This is why they hemorrhaged players in Wrath and will hemorrhage even more faster now, which we've already seen. People were already underwhelmed by this expansion when it dropped. I agree they had a lot of work to do fixing the old world and they accomplished a great feat, but they had only 3 dungeons at launch with a handful of bosses and almost no trash. It's getting easier for them to design and make these miniscule dungeons, in comparison to original/BC and we still get less bosses. No new talents and some minor quality of life fixes that were long overdue make this expansion feel stay from a player perspective. Playing another class isn't an option for everyone and people started this expansion bored after the newness wore off. They also got rid of stats to simplify the process of gearing our for tanks/dps and heals and they then add the most complicated stat any game has ever had. It's great for some classes and bottom of the barrel for others we would have been better off without it. It feels the same as Wrath only worse, because people were looking forward to Arthas for years. Maybe they don't have the endless amounts of stories/bosses they thought they did to draw from and are saving some for the next expansion. I don't know, but I do know that this expansion makes me feel cheated the more it goes along and I'm not the only one.<br />
<br />
Every time they add a new feature it's like they intentionally sabotage it so people are distracted by it to notice the real problem. Void storage is just another bank that isn't really necessary but it's a nice bonus, until you hear about the deposit fee for items losing all enchants/gems etc that you paid thousands of gold to get. They add a search feature to the bank that should've been there for years. Void transmogrification looks like a last ditch effort to keep people playing the game. It's something they said they would never do. They wanted to keep the integrity of the artwork and gear in place. People should know what you have on and when gear looks like garbage you should have to live with it, at least that's what they said shortly after this expansion dropped and repeated until around 4.1. If the cost is low like reforging it'll be a nice touch scaling slightly depending on gear level. Even though it's still a kick in the nuts for something most other MMOs let you do for free.<br />
<br />
I seriously hope they have more planned for 4.3 then a overly expensive bank that charges you to deposit, An item appearance feature that costs money, bag/bank search features, 3 heroics which could be anything from 3-5 boss or recycled content and Deathwing flying in insanely prematurely. I'm betting the Deathwing raid will have ony 6-8 bosses too. Unless this is just the first major content of the patch announced for 4.3, and I mean the rest needs to be just as major, get ready for another Wrath ending year long snoozefest. It like one giant April fools joke. Please tell me it's April...Anyone. <br />
<br />
They did say they would try to release expansions faster. Dropping in MAR-JUN of 2012 would be amazing, but since they seem to be more understaffed then ever and couldn't deliver on BC when they had the entire dev team on it, it's not looking so good.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Get ready to raid Deathwing for a long time, more heroics no one will care about after a week and some other features you may or may not use over the next stretch of no major content released gameplay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quite frankly, everything has always been implemented poorly and then perfected over many years.<br />
<br />
Look at LFG for 5 mans. They went through several designs of a LFG tool, a LFG channel, meeting stones, then innkeepers, until after more than 5 years, they finally came up with the RDF system. Which itself is really just the old meeting stone system that now works better because of all the class homogenization that's taken place over the last couple of expansions. They had the idea a long time ago, they just needed the rest of the game to catch up for it to work.<br />
<br />
This isn't anything to leave over if everything else hasn't driven you away yet. The uselessness of this just means most people will still need a storage mule. It's a non-issue for most people.<br />
The few chronic hoarders who actually do have their banks filled with soulbound gear will now have 80 more slots they'll fill up with gear. The withdrawl cost won't be an issue because they'll keep anything they'll actually play with in their normal bank. This will just be a place to stash the things they'll never use. <br />
<br />
It was a waste of dev time, yeah. But I doubt it took anything away from anything else that would have actually been useful so it's really much ado about nothing. <br />
<br />
The only real issue I have with it is that it could have easily been so much more and actually eliminated the need for storage mules for everyone. Perhaps one day, that will happen. It just won't be with the next patch. <br />

<br />
This is why they hemorrhaged players in Wrath and will hemorrhage even more faster now, which we've already seen.<br />
<br />
They added subs in Wrath. They hit the 11 million milestone (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/press/pressreleases.html?id=2847812) in 2008 when Wrath was announced with 11.5M coming soon (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/press/pressreleases.html?id=2847816) after it was released. It hit it's peak right after the release of Cata In Dec 2010 with 12.5 million subs. <br />
<br />
Cata was obviously a step backwards as it's the first expansion not to add to their subscriber base, but it's hardly caused a hemorrhage of players. It's hasn't even caused a paper cut. They're right where they were when they first announced it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm betting they're placeholder numbers and each piece won't cost more then their vendoring price to transfer.<br />
Yes, it's a placeholder and some posters could use sedatives... At the same time, I am concerned about the price. I do understand where Blizzard is coming from -- trying to dissuade people from using it as a second bank -- but 100g per item is rather high in my opinion. Perhaps somewhere in the range of 30g - 50g would work?</div></div><hr />

What do you plan with the boat load of gold you have in your wallet? invest in a retirement plan for your character? Mortgage your next tier armor? College fund for your orc orphan? What's the reason for people to adhere to much to their WoW gold, as if there is something useful to do with it? Buying largely overpriced crafted armor which is easily outgeared by dungeon/raid drops or CP vendors? idiot vanity items that are used to rip people off? This is one of the great ways to stop the insane in-game inflation, regulate prices and control gold sellers. I find it very logical.</div></div><hr />
