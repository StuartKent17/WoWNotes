Many things we experience in-game are scaled or modified for gameplay and logistical reasons. A real map of Azeroth would have the islands between the continents much smaller. This map is just showing us important locations in relation to one another, but not to scale.</div></div><hr />

It also wouldn't be a difficult problem to fix.<br />
<br />
Honestly, they should just put Kezan, the Wandering Isle, the Maelstrom, the Broken Isles, Kul Tiras, and Zandalar to scale and have a big chunk of text that says &quot;The Great Sea&quot; to take you to a map of the Great Sea that has them all at the size they want them showed, then you can click on to them.<br />

<br />
There is no such thing as a beta key AFAIK for already released games. You have to login to your battle.net account on their website and under your account settings &quot;opt-in&quot; for beta's for the various Blizzard games.<br />
<br />
After that its just random if you get into the beta or not. They send you an email when you get access and then you see it on your battle.net launcher.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is not a single person on planet earth who would have actually difficulty clicking on the continent at actual size.<br />
There is legitimately not a single reason to change the map and require people to click on additional sections when it can be clearly as<br />
shown on a single map. These are not a different planet, they should be easily viewable from the in game map.</div></div><hr />

Actually no need for an argument. You have yet to provide a single valid reason for any change to the map to occur. It seems more like your feelings are hurt because you can't separate an in-game map from the actual landmass size. Fortunately Blizzard does not cater to people like you and are more focused on providing a convenient map vs a scale map.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gambit5555</div><div class="date">2018-05-09, 05:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Please give me one reason why having continents 10 times their actual size has ANY convenience whatsoever, other than helping blind people or people with parkisons.<br />
<br />
It's really quite simple. The in game map is designed to be visually pleasing and easily viewable, much like a real world map. This may come as shocking to you, but if you see a map of the US, Alaska and Hawaii don't actually float south of the country in little boxes in the Gulf of Mexico. They are placed there for visibility and convenience. And the in game map isn't even designed for navigation like a real world map. It is designed to quickly locate lands in relation to other lands. So there is no logical reason to make the islands miniscule on the map when there only purpose is to be visually appealing and to show location in relation to other landmasses</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gambit5555</div><div class="date">2018-05-09, 05:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Visually pleasing&quot; &quot;easily viewable&quot;<br />
<br />
is this neither of those things?<br />
<br />
https://i.imgur.com/jgTWJgb.jpg<br />
<br />
It's absolutely ridiculous for BI zandalar and kt to be that large, even slightly larger is understandable, there is no reason for them to be that big. If you have trouble seeing them or clicking on them, that's on you. size of the land doesn't matter either, it's scalable, the only thing you would notice is the actual land being larger then the other continents on the map.<br />
Actually yes, it is more visually pleasing and matches aesthetically to WOW's other in game maps. The map you posted in no way matches the in game aesthetics. And if you have a problem with the islands being to large in game, that's on you, and Blizzard clearly agrees with me, so your opinion is utterly worthless here. Glad we had this talk. P.S, feel free just to open up Chronicle and look at the maps there anytime you need to see the world map if it makes you feel better</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gambit5555</div><div class="date">2018-05-09, 05:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard always catered to the casuals so not surprising here.<br />
<br />
And yet here you are, seven expansions later, arguing about island size of ingame maps. What does that say about you? Maybe you should move on to a different game that has more accurately scaled maps for ya. Or are just another casual?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gambit5555</div><div class="date">2018-05-09, 06:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like a casual mindset to me, wanting blizzard to cater to your nonexistant needs of wanting maps to be ridiculously oversized, sounds like you're reversing the argument.<br />
<br />
Once again, no need for an argument. Blizzard has already placed maps in game which are visually appealing and work for there purpose. And you have yet to provide a single valid reason for them to change them. So really you don't have a leg to stand on here kid, and since blizzard &quot;caters to casuals&quot; as you put it, you should just run along to a different game. Don't let your addiction keep you where you are unhappy. Break free and gain control of your life</div></div><hr />

<br />
The argument is, blizzard has NO reason to make them huge. I don't care if you like it or not, saying i haven't provided valid reasons just makes you more of a hypocrite. So, &quot;kid&quot;, please explain why blizzard, who you're obviously shilling for, needs to make continents 10x their actual size? Use an argument other than &quot;Daddy blizz made it that way!&quot;.<br />
<br />
We can keep arguing for hours if you want, neither of us will give up, it's pointless now.<br />
<br />
Lol, once again, I have no need to argue anything, as I am not seeking to change anything. The maps Blizzard are using are visually better, aesthetically match their current in game maps, and provide ease of use. You on the other hand have yet to provide a single legitimate reason to change, making yourself look foolish in the process by not acknowledging that Blizzard maps aren't to scale, nor have they ever been. But keep accusing people of shilling when you can't leave a game that obviously does not fit your needs. It is humorous</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you admit you have no valid reasoning. Glad we could clear that up. Fortunately Blizzard has designers with capabilities far exceeding your weak mind, so they are able to seen for the millions who play this game, while the trolls like you can sit and cry about island size. Pathetic</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also top kek at the weak mind and trolling comments.<br />
<br />
Once again, for the fourth time so far, it visually matches the aesthetics of current in game maps, it matches the art design of WoW as a whole, and it provides an easy to use interface for the player base. The fact that this has been stated multiple times and you lack the competency to understand it is telling. You on the other hand still have not provided a single argument for changing it other than &quot; I don't like it...whaaaaaaa&quot;. This is why it won't get changed. You can't provide a valid or convincing argument for any change, other than personal art preference, which you have convinced yourself is some guiding principle. And as I can see everyone has taken to ignoring your whining and trolling, I think I will follow suit. And please, quit WoW and never look back. The game will be a better place without you</div></div><hr />
