<br />
Before you can harbor any hope of defeating the Iron Horde, you must first understand what—and whom—you’re up against. Our five-part series Lords of War introduces you to some of the major players in the campaign on Draenor, continuing today with the tale of Durotan, son of Garad and father of Thrall.<br />
<br />
The unforgiving land of the Frostwolf clan does not reward sentiment. When young Durotan’s mother fell deathly ill, he had a choice: Allow her life to come to a natural end, or pay a heavy price to save her.<br />
<br />
&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve watched his story, visit our newly posted &lt;a href=&quot;http://battle.net/wow/game/lore/characters/durotan&quot;&gt;Durotan character page&lt;/a&gt; to read more about his legacy and his role in the events to come.&lt;/p&gt;<br />

<br />
I actually thought that aswell.<br />
<br />
Anyway it wasnt bad. But Durotan is likely my favorite horde char and i dont think this video fully shows him justice. Its a touching story and all. But the other videos showed who the characters where and then the moment they where famous for. And this just isnt it for Durotan.<br />
Granted some of the things he is most known for(like saying no to demon blood) wont happen in WoD but still. <br />
<br />
Here he is(to me) showed as an orc who fights against the bloodlust, and his primary fight is actually against that bloodlust. But thats not really him.<br />
<br />
Maybe this doesnt make sense :/</div></div><hr />

In Rise of the Horde, even Frostwolves had trouble controlling the blood rage when it came upon them. There's a particular moment where during the attack on Telmor many orcs just lose themselves, Durotan included.<br />
<br />
But anyhow, damn. That was powerful.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it has to do with Sargeras corruption then?<br />

Well close, but backwards :P The orc racial in WoW was a tribute to that quality of orcs having that blood rage<br />

Pretty much, from there on it depends on whether you actually have the willpower to fight it (like Grom Hellscream, when demons weren't raining from the sky at least) or give in to it (Bonechewers, Burning Blade, etc.).</div></div><hr />

This one is more hard nuts in the spiritual sense and I like it ^^<br />
<br />
Do agree that the voice acting was a bit off, they seemed a bit gentile compared to the rough and gruff that you usually associate with orcs but then again, these guys are supposed to be more in control, so it makes sense that their voices would be softer - maybe not -that- soft though :)<br />

You realize that bloodlust was an ogre-mage spell? Even what you think is right is a retcon. And orcs have always been naturally aggressive and warlike, thats why they were chosen by Kiljaeden to invade Azeroth in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Yep, that's it exactly. It's called different things (bloodlust, blood fury, battle rage), but orcs sometimes lose control and basically black out, see red, go berserk.</div></div><hr />

It felt way too human boy, but other than that not bad. Don't know enough on the Lore at the moment to be that upset about succumbing to the Blood Rage. I was under the impression that was not demonic but what was always an Orc trait and that the demonblood essentially turned it on all the time, but again this is me just pulling from general memory.</div></div><hr />

Gromm was stillraiding ogre lands and lopping off heads.<br />

In Rise of the Horde the orcs lose themselves and kill draenei children. Durotan is like the only one who doesn't.<br />

This is probably linked to that.</div></div><hr />

I do find it ironic though that Grom's story is the most bland, even though he's the &quot;main baddie&quot;. Kargath and Durotan's stories really make you care about the characters, where as Grom's left me thinking &quot; . . . that guy's an idiot&quot;. But maybe that was the point.</div></div><hr />

All Orcs have blood lust, in fact, it's one of the Racials of Orcs. The demon blood just put that blood lust on overdrive and made it so they couldn't turn it off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually felt this entire story contrasted poorly with how Durotan is displayed in Rise of the Horde. In RotH he's made out to be a large boy (the largest of his clan), with a bold sense of pride (in himself and his clan) and very competitive nature. Here he is depicted as a smaller/weaker orc than his much more prideful, older brother who cares much more for his clan. To me he comes across as a real &quot;mother's boy&quot; and gets on like a stroppy teenager. He definitely didn't become a warlord or even Warchief by protecting his mother or killing some level 4 wolves from Durotar. He supposedly killed Ogres and even Gronn whilst growing up in RotH which would have made a much better watch.<br />
I'd have preferred to have seen him beside Orgrim, being saved by the Draenei and meeting Velen. That ultimately would have given more of an idea of his mindset on the upcoming conflict than having his mum's dead pet over his head for the majority of his life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said it was when he was really young and maybe this is his moment where he becomes that all mighty hero we know. He lasts all winter protecting his sick mother by himself against a pack of much larger wolves and you don't think the clan will think he is powerful when they get back? No one has ever done that and for him to rise above it is huge!</div></div><hr />

Durotan is the wolf, noble and proud, but even the most noble wolf when backed into a corner can succumb to its feral rage and bloodlust, all in order to survive. <br />

Reading your post, and many of the comments in this topic, makes me a sad orc.<br />
So no one really remembers the quest line involving Dranosh Saurfang in Nagrand? (Saurfang the Younger)<br />
I'm quoting what he says when you accept the quest (copied the text from WOWPEDIA)<br />
<br />
&quot;They died. All of them...<br />
As the Murkbloods cut through us, something took hold of me that I cannot understand. Tell me, have you ever felt a rage so great that whole of your being burns? A heat that wilts the living? A heat that incinerates the blood in you veins? That is what I felt.<br />
&lt;Saurfang's eyes glow red for a brief moment.&gt;<br />
I was the last one left alive. 30 of them surrounded me... Murkbloods... I remember nothing beyond that vision. I blacked out and awoke some time later.&quot;<br />
<br />
SAURFANG'S EYES GLOW RED FOR A BRIEF MOMENT<br />
<br />
Plus, when you fought High Overlord Saurfang in Orgrimmar back in the days, when someone hit a critical hit, he used Saurfang's Rage, and it showed an emote that read &quot;High Overlord Saurfang's eyes glow red&quot;.<br />
<br />
By the way, the game make it clear that Dranosh remained untainted by the corruption.</div></div><hr />

In Rise of the Horde, it's also stated that his parents were worried because Durotan was rather 'soft'. I dunno, I felt the vid was quite fitting, it showed why maybe they'd think that and explained why he acted the way he did in later battles.<br />
<br />
I also don't seem to recall him being considered particularily large. Older than the other kids of his generation, I recall that. Now Thrall, Thrall is supposedly a damn giant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't seem entirely unreasonable that on a savage world such as Draenor the orcs would develop a sort of advanced adrenaline rush as a self preservation mechanic. The idea that the demonblood made it permanent still makes it fit pre-existing lore. I think it still works with the idea of the noble savage the orcs are supposed to encompass.</div></div><hr />
