Winter Veil 2016<br />
The Feast of Winter Veil (http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/141-feast-of-winter-veil) has returned with some updates!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Snowglobes have been added to Orgrimmar, Ironforge, and Dalaran! While inside, you have the holiday goblin transformation and are able to fly<br />
The BB King (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/4437-bb-king) achievements have been hotfixed to remove Varian and Vol'jin from the required leaders<br />
The Endothermic Blaster (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128636-endothermic-blaster) is the gift this year, rewarding Brr... It's Cold in Here (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/10751-brr-its-cold-in-here)<br />
Miniature Winter Veil Tree (http://www.wowdb.com/items/117371-miniature-winter-veil-tree?bonusIDs=3493) is now item level 835.<br />
Finely-Tailored Red Holiday Hat (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139299-finely-tailored-red-holiday-hat) is dropped by Talixae Flamewreath (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/104217-talixae-flamewreath) in Court of Stars<br />
Finely-Tailored Green Holiday Hat (http://www.wowdb.com/items/139300-finely-tailored-green-holiday-hat) is dropped by Illysanna Ravencrest (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/98696-illysanna-ravencrest) (Black Rook Hold) and King Deepbeard (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/91797-king-deepbeard) (Eye of Azshara)<br />

Blizzard Holiday Activity 2016-2017<br />
Hey all!<br />
<br />
As you are undoubtedly aware, Winter Veil is soon to come to Azeroth, bringing with it a season of good cheer and high spirits, as well as a time where we gather together with those who we hold closest to us - family, friends, and colleagues.<br />
<br />
In the same spirit, winter is upon us, and we wanted to take this chance to share some notices on our activity throughout the remainder of the holiday season and on into the New Year.<br />
<br />
<br />
There will be less Blizzard employee activity and engagement across most World of Warcraft forums, especially the PTR forums and General Discussion. <br />
There will be reduced activity and engagement on World of Warcraft's social media, particularly notable is WarcraftDevs, which will have reduced activity through to the new year.<br />
Customer Support staff will still be hard at work during the holidays - if you need to contact Customer Support for any reason, you will be able to do so through the Blizzard Support site. Please take note that there will still be Support staff monitoring the forums and assisting with moderation, and our Customer Support forums will remain active through the holiday season!<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s important to note that we will still be going over threads posted during the holidays when we return, so continue to share your thoughts and feedback while we’re away!<br />
<br />
We’d like to thank everyone for their understanding as we step away from our keyboards and take time to travel and visit with our loved ones. We look forward to returning after the holidays in 2017, for what looks to be an amazing year for both Blizzard and World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
From all of us here at Blizzard: Happy holidays, happy New Year, and we will see you in 2017!<br />
<br />

Developer Communication<br />
I think there is still a lot more work to be done to develop a feedback cycle that effectively nurtures constructive discussions.<br />
The &quot;feedback cycle&quot; is one of the hardest things we are working with at the moment. There is just a ton of feedback all the time, and it never ends, so as soon as you, say, send a dev and email and explain the state of the feedback, its probably already changed ten-fold. :P <br />
<br />
It's not an instantaneous fix, but more of a long term solution that will take a lot of changes to how we function doing certain processes internally. I think there's some good solutions for this that I'm working with Lore on into the beginning of next year. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/789094-bursts-out-laughing/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752656388?page=4#80))<br />
<br />
Patch 7.1.5 and Nighthold Release Date<br />
They have said before that 7.1.5 and Nighthold release are independent of each other<br />
They are independent of each other.<br />
<br />
As another note, this means that Cutting Edge: Xavius and Ahead of the Curve: Xavius will become unobtainable with the release of Nighthold on January 17.<br />
<br />
You are still going to release Nighthold with the state of the PTR as it is?<br />
Nighthold =/= 7.1.5<br />
<br />
Edit: To clarify a bit, and expand on something I should have mentioned originally - with this I meant the PTR is in flux, and there's a lot of tuning to be done still prior to 7.1.5 and Nighthold's release - but we also don't agree that the state of the PTR is bad. We wouldn't drop a patch with major class changes in the middle of a raid tier, as even we agree that would be silly.

is Elothir &lt;Archdruid of Lore&gt; a mortal druid that took shape of a tree? If so, is he a Night Elf or Tauren?<br />

Should make a permadeath WoW server.... hmmm. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/806748889734746112))<br />
How about just no way to release, you must be resurrected. It would be fairly permanent if you didn't have living healer friends.<br />
.Either way all of your loot definitely drops on the floor when you die and other people can take it (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/806752098285064192))<br />

So with Warlords, are we slowly learning the grass isn't so green? I mean, honestly, the spec's were in better shape in Warlords, that is saying something.

How about understanding , that not everyone enjoys the same content, we all play differently, and placing a holiday limited time frame item, behind one small area of the games content, is kinda silly. <br />
<br />
Not a huge problem for me personally, (I haven't touched a mythic dungeon at all, don't care about them so meh) however I do understand that different people, like different things, and play differently from myself.</div></div><hr />

Then you don't need it, do you? You already chose not to do it, so what's silly is complaining that you can't get it when you chose not to get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is it different from not getting things for not doing PvP or PvE that have limited timeframes? The game is right there, the Item is freely available to you. All you need to do is the content it is within.<br />
<br />
Don't want to do the content, don't receive the reward for it. Basic principle.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Complaining and just understanding something from another's view point aren't the same thing.<br />
<br />
However if this item was only available from the end boss in mythic level only raids, I can imagine there would be people complaining about that too, and the same goes for if it was rewarded purely from winning say 5 arena games or similar. <br />
<br />
My point being, that for a limited time holiday event, I personally do agree that I find it to be rather silly to put it behind a mythic only (non queuable content) dungeon boss, nothing stopping them from putting it on a normal or heroic mode dungeon boss, so that the majority are more likely to be able to get it. <br />
<br />
After all it's just a fun holiday item on a limited time frame.<br />
<br />
Myself personally, like I said, I don't need it, and even if I did, I don't do mythics or even dungeons in general so I just wouldn't bother anyway. However I do see it from others PoV. <br />
<br />
There is no need to really get defensive about it at all, I mean putting it onto a normal or Heroic dungeon boss to give even more players a chance at it, is that going to affect you negatively? <br />
<br />
Just my own thoughts on the matter :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
However if this item was only available from the end boss in mythic level only raids, I can imagine there would be people complaining about that too, and the same goes for if it was rewarded purely from winning say 5 arena games or similar. <br />
<br />
My point being, that for a limited time holiday event, I personally do agree that I find it to be rather silly to put it behind a mythic only (non queuable content) dungeon boss, nothing stopping them from putting it on a normal or heroic mode dungeon boss, so that the majority are more likely to be able to get it. <br />
<br />
After all it's just a fun holiday item on a limited time frame.<br />
<br />
Myself personally, like I said, I don't need it, and even if I did, I don't do mythics or even dungeons in general so I just wouldn't bother anyway. However I do see it from others PoV. <br />
<br />
There is no need to really get defensive about it at all, I mean putting it onto a normal or Heroic dungeon boss to give even more players a chance at it, is that going to affect you negatively? <br />
<br />
Just my own thoughts on the matter :)<br />
<br />
Yes it affects me that idiots like u still make this same arguement<br />
<br />
at work u must demand for the same pay as your higher ups because its only fair right? who cares who worked for anything, everyone should just get everything for free</div></div><hr />

And I am the idiot? Did you read through what you wrote? /rolls eyes.<br />
<br />
Equating work pay to an in game once a year fun holiday event... I'm done haha. <br />
<br />
You gave me a laugh though, thanks for that and have a super Christmas :D</div></div><hr />

Oh boy, sure calls for more vacation time and working less. They sure do start Christmas earlier and earlier each year. /s<br />
<br />
&quot;But what about the people who just work there?&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sure they could afford to bring their family to CA instead of going away instead.</div></div><hr />
