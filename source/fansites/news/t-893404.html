My thinking exactly... but it's whatever. I'd rather have 1.5 hours of extended maintenance than the servers come up now and be crashing left in right like in early WoTLK/BC days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was done with Noblegarden in 2009, and had nothing to do in 2010 and this year. Come to think of it, I had nothing to do during most of Blizzard's holidays last year, hate how they are set in stone and immune to change. Here's predicting the opposite Oracles or Wolvar quest chain in Northrend during Children's Week still cannot be done if you did it in 2009 with a Sorry, working as intended, move along.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not a single one comes to mind, nada, none.<br />
<br />
Most big patch days should not count against game credit with their history. I wonder if the only reason they make false estimates on &quot;expected&quot; downtime then have &quot;delays&quot; is otherwise they would end up refunding a lot more instead of only on the multi-day screwups. It only ends up &lt;50 cents to us, sure, but times millions its a lot of money, Superman 3/Office Space style :)</div></div><hr />

Actually they could learn from the Devs at Rift....Every patch on Rift has been deployed on time. When they take a server down for 15 or 30 minutes it comes back up in 15 or 30 minutes.</div></div><hr />

I agree, they have been doing this since Vanilla. -.- &quot;Downtime from 3am - 11am&quot; then &quot;Oops sorry we aren't sure wen we will have it back up.&quot; Its one of the things I enjoy about Rift (Yes I do play both) when they say 30minutes that is exactly what you get.

<br />
I don't think people are upset that its delayed AGAIN. Everyone knows its going to be delayed. They're upset that blizzard keeps pretending it will be done at 11:00 and then issuing a last minute &quot;Oh, we encountered completely unforeseen circumstances and will have to delay.&quot; We just want them to stop lying to us. It's really insulting. That's what people are upset about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vanilla wasn't as bad on patch days, it's just been getting progressively worse each expansion (which I don't blame them since they do have to deal with more servers). Wait till Rift gets more settled in, then you'll be bitching also.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They always underpromise. Every maintenance has an &quot;expected&quot; downtime listed, not a guaranteed downtime. It's no different from e-mailing every department to notify that you'll be upgrading a few things today, and while you don't expect any problems it's a heads up that something could go wrong. They took the servers down 2 hours earlier than normal maintenance in anticipation of how long they &quot;expected&quot; it to take.<br />
<br />
They follow every IT mantra when pushing these patches. Test it on private, test it some more on private, bring up a couple live servers internally with the changes, and then push it to all the servers. Shit happens, and they have to fix it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have ever worked in the IT field you would know that you don't keep telling people an update will take eight hours if it's never ever in the history of man taken less than ten. If you keep lying to your entire company and finishing late every single time then you're really not good at your job and everyone is going to be unhappy with you and your department. Do you want to promise 5 hours and look like an incompetent fool who always finishes everything late or do you want to promise 10 hours and be the pro who always finishes ahead of schedule?

The maintenance doesn't always get delayed, usually it goes for the 8hrs they say.</div></div><hr />

That is true... but then.... They didn't spend 6 months on PTR rewamping 1 dungeon and still manage to mess up endless numbers of data - including Worgen soundfiles... Bugged mount running animation and ofc... dc ..dc... and no instance available ...</div></div><hr />

Seems like they needed the extra month ye.. Xmas - Easter... its only few months anyway when it comes to ZG and BLizzard. Who cares about 100$ in sub money - right ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. This $.1 is only one instance. You ppl read patch notes? <br />
<br />
1st their internal wow is way more advance then ptr and when migrate to real server create problems that did not happen on ptr so they have ti fix it fast.<br />
2nd 4.1 is way more extend then 4.2. If what I know is right 4.2 will be Firelands and some late fixes to 4.1 (probably tooltips). This one introduce way more features and changes. <br />
Patch are not about instance only go check what they introduce and see for yourself. <br />
A instance and raids are only graphics with some scripts on bosses nothing hard when you compare with new lag system, graphics, classes changes, guild and queue changes, etc...<br />
<br />
And btw not all server did the extend. Some are allready up.</div></div><hr />

What does that have to do with the price of tea in China? Maintenance =/= patches. Patches are ALWAYS delayed. Note all of the people replying to this with sarcastic shock. Let me give you an analogy... Just because driving to St Louis always takes 5 hours doesn't mean you can pretend that driving to LA will also take 5 hours when it took over 7 the last 50 times you did it.</div></div><hr />
