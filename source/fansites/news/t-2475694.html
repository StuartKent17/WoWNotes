Update Notes WIP DO NOT RELEASE<br />
<br />
April 1, 2019<br />
<br />
Companion App Update: Findr<br />
Find your next tank, healer, or damage dealer at a glance with the latest update to the WoW Companion App: Findr. When you open the Findr feature, you’ll be presented with a picture and a brief description of another player, and you can decide whether they’d be the right match for your party. Features include:<br />
Glance at a player’s gear and achievement points for 3 seconds (maximum) before making a snap judgment about how well they’ll tank your Mythic Keystone run.<br />
<br />
Swipe right to request a match and immediately send a party invitation.<br />
Swipe left to completely dismiss the player’s entire existence; this is completely anonymous, distancing you from the other player’s growing vortex of self-doubt.<br />
Once a match has been made, option to not message them right away, which makes it look like you’re super busy and use Findr all the time.<br />
<br />
When the time is right, gather your new groupmates together, and head off to whatever adventures lay in store!<br />
<br />
General<br />

Seriously dude? I mean during the year, you get a few funny ideas, you make notes and collect them before April 1st. It might take 1 man hour all together. Everyone needs to relax, even developers. This does not delay anything. Stupid decisions do (and those, unfortunately, they make very often).</div></div><hr />

So a 1:56 video, that is a ripoff of a video done only a few months earlier, is somehow better then a massive post of in jokes and memes?<br />
and again, this has been a thing every single year. and its not shitty if people enjoy it, maybe you just need a better sense of humor...<br />
watched throguh that thing, not a single giggle or laugh from me, smiles sure, but the ending was just cringe &quot;oh no the thing ends up turning on the family and attacking them oh no i didnt see that coming!&quot;<br />

Why am I not surprised that he/she/it would defend Blizzard's shitty April Fools joke over any other game's better attempt.<br />
<br />
I never said FFXIV's was original btw, I just pointed out that it had way more effort into it.<br />
<br />
Nice try!<br />

I wish they would add some stuff in game, even if it angered some people.

This does not delay anything. Stupid decisions do (and those, unfortunately, they make very often).Last time they didn't cut the corner and made a really good prank. A LOT of people were angry. So angry they ruined and reduced the future prank into text.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because Kotick is solely responsible for putting out april fools &quot;jokes&quot; that some MMOC troll aproves of. Newsflash, neither the world, nor Kotick's day-to-day, doesn't revolve around you. The sooner you figure that out, the better off the world will be.</div></div><hr />

I wish they would add some stuff in game, even if it angered some people. Maybe to the Tortollan world quests since people already avoid those, like actually making the shell game 64x64, making the calligraphy quest something impossible, or something simple like taking the turtles out of beachhead and make it about slaying seagulls in crabs because the tortollan woman is feeling vengeful.<br />
<br />
I remember one year in WOTLK we all logged in and our characters had been turned into Tuskarr. We played as Tuskarr for all of April Fool's Day. All our abilities and traits were unchanged, we just ran around looking like Tuskarr. It was great!</div></div><hr />

8.1.7 Patch Notes<br />
<br />
New &amp; Updated Features<br />
<br />
New Zone: The Grind Isle<br />
<br />
A new island has emerged off the coast off Stormsong Valley. There are no treasures or rare creatures. (There are creatures labeled as rare which respawn every 5 minutes though. The rare label is removed once you kill it for the first time.)<br />
Team up with your friends and kill creatures.<br />
The island will be story-gated despite the fact that there is no story. To progress further into the island, the player must complete the weekly quest chains. These storylines will be spread across eight weeks! Based off our data, we know players love this type of content.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Story and World<br />
<br />
To help players enjoy world content again, we are adding over five new world quests! Enjoy!<br />
The data has indicated that players thoroughly enjoy world quests. We plan on adding over twenty new world quests in the next major update!<br />
The item level cap for world quests is now 420. You can be on par with a mythic raider just by doing world quests now!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Portals<br />
<br />
The cataclysm portals have been removed. What content are folks doing in like Uldum or twilight highlands that the portals help so much with?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Changes<br />
<br />
Azerite<br />
<br />
From our data, we can clearly see that players are enjoying the azerite grind. With that said, we will be increasing the level cap to 500.<br />
With the new azerite level cap, we have increased the level requirement for azerite traits drastically.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mission Table<br />
<br />
We have added twenty new missions that involve Nazjatar! Send your followers to retrieve the naga loot! (8.2 will not contain Nazjatar.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Reputation<br />
<br />
The old reputations are too creative compared to the ones we have today. To fix this issue, we have made every single reputation in the game a world quest ONLY grind. We are excited to see the data for this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
A crazy little imp has hacked into our systems and now all class spells are on a ten-minute cooldown. Luckily, we have added a toy to fix this madness!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Players can buy the “Spell Cooldown Fixer” toy from the in-game shop for only $60 to fix their class spell cooldowns.</div></div><hr />

From what I recall, these are made by having everyone on the team submit entries, and the CMs compiles the final draft.(The CMs NOT named &quot;Lore&quot;, he's too busy polishing Ion's apples.)(That sounds filthy...but I'll leave it.) <br />
<br />
The people who put these together and have made the fake webpages in the past weren't game devs, anyway. <br />

The fake patch notes drew a few chuckles from me. People would complain if they didn't do their usual April 1 routine, so as usual Blizz can do no right. The FFXIV &quot;Omega&quot; vid likewise drew a few chuckles. Obviously it is a parody, and yes &quot;predictable&quot;, but still amusing (I never saw the original it was based on, so maybe that helps?). I say this as a fan of both games that I typically alternate between. Also, since when does comedy need to be original to be funny?</div></div><hr />

Find your next tank, healer, or damage dealer at a glance with the latest update to the WoW Companion App: Findr. When you open the Findr feature, you’ll be presented with a picture and a brief description of another player, and you can decide whether they’d be the right match for your party. Features include: Glance at a player’s gear and achievement points for 3 seconds (maximum) before making a snap judgment about how well they’ll tank your Mythic Keystone run.<br />
<br />
Swipe right to request a match and immediately send a party invitation.<br />
Swipe left to completely dismiss the player’s entire existence; this is completely anonymous, distancing you from the other player’s growing vortex of self-doubt.<br />
Once a match has been made, option to not message them right away, which makes it look like you’re super busy and use Findr all the time.<br />
<br />
When the time is right, gather your new groupmates together, and head off to whatever adventures lay in store!<br />

It reminds me of an old joke: <br />
<br />
Some kid brings his grade card to his dad. That kid has failed on each subjects except for music, which he aced. <br />
Dad takes a look at his son grades and - BAM! Slaps him in the face. <br />
<br />
The kid, half dazed try saing...&quot;but I got an A in music&quot;..<br />
The dad in response say: after failing so bad you're still in the mood for singing?!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The amount of humor/effort written into the April Fools jokes is minimal compared to other years (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G7b1zOhO_A). <br />

Are you guys seriously arguing about April Fool's jokes? I have to say it's most pathetic thing I've seen in my life.<br />
<br />
First, if that's the most pathetic thing you have seen in life, you got a lot to live and experience it seems.<br />
<br />
Second, is more pathetic whining about an april's fool's jokes, that trying to defend a CM that wrote this, and even more pathetic to think this joke in any way affects the development of the game.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</div></div><hr />

Sorry (not really), not everyone can be a pathetic fanboy that jumps in joy at every pice of semi-positive drivel being thrown their way. Also funny is highly subjective and memes in their primary form on the internet are forbidden for a reason here. Btw, to soothe your fragile blue knight soul, the part about this year being particularily desperate and cringy was not in relation to wow, that was just standard &quot;meh&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Posting memes on this board is forbidden at least in their picture format - which is their primary form on the internet if your are honest - I guess this is news to you somehow. I even went out of the way to include the caveat for the 2 people that actually type them out instead. Not sure what dark orivice you pulled the my country part out of. I'm far from being a nationalist or even patriotic as well, but nice try at constructing an ad hominem. If you keep at it, you might accidently score a hit sooner or later.<br />
<br />
Btw, I let you in on a secret, I laugh plenty. Especially when reading your posts :p.</div></div><hr />

Memes are not forbidden here... Posting literally JUST a meme is, but memes are very often posted here... Also nah memes are primarely video these days, idk are you thinking of rage comics? cause its mostly videos these days.<br />
<br />
And man, you have one messed up sense of humor if you find the blizzard post horrid enough to not even smile at but forum posts enough to laugh at.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That you should point out to people whining about a simple joke and not the ones who are &quot;wtf are you shitting on this??&quot;, since you said that defending a joke is &quot;the most pathetic thing you have seen&quot; what about whining about a joke? that's my point.<br />
<br />
P.D: yep read your post again, you were saying all of them, sorry! my bad<br />
P.D2: I think that actually the really pathetic thing is whining about a joke, or thinking this takes development time.</div></div><hr />
