After many grueling bouts in the Arenas and Battlegrounds, the time has nearly come to see who will reign supreme in this action-packed PvP season. Prepare to fight your last battles, and remember—to the victors go the spoils!<br />
<br />
Arena and Rated Battleground Season 15 will be coming to an end in a couple of weeks. Once the season wraps, we'll begin an approximately two week process to determine end-of-season reward eligibility.<br />
<br />
Qualified players should note the following in order to ensure you receive your just rewards:<br />
<br />
<br />
Please refrain from transferring your characters to another realm or faction until after PvP Season 15 has ended.<br />
PvP Season 15 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points at the end of the season, and any Honor above 4,000 will be converted to in-game currency at a rate of 35 silver per point. A few other things to keep in mind once the season has ended:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Honor cap will remain at 4,000.<br />
Season 15 items with rating requirements will no longer be available for purchase.<br />
Rated Battleground and Arena matches will not be available during the break between seasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best of luck, gladiators!</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Couple&quot; is generally understood to mean &quot;two&quot; but it is telling that they didn't specify a date. Gives them some wiggle room.<br />

6.0 soon!!!</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't surprise me if it was next week anyway. The formulation is vague enough so that they can say &quot;you were warned&quot;. That's probably what they learned from last time, when they had to postpone the patch after not giving out the warning early enough.<br />

Why waiting another weeks over weeks?!<br />
It really sucks. Last months we had nothing to do except pvp. And now waiting a few more weeks...c'mon. I know they want to do it right, but it feels like doing it 1000000000% right and on patchday it will suck anyway and nothing will work - like every patchday. so what is the matter?<br />
it is pay for wait atm.</div></div><hr />

You do realize it does not right?<br />
<br />
<br />
Adj.	1.	a couple of - more than one but indefinitely small in number - a couple of - more than one but indefinitely small in number; &quot;a few roses&quot;; &quot;a couple of roses&quot;<br />
a few<br />
few - a quantifier that can be used with count nouns and is often preceded by `a'; a small but indefinite number; &quot;a few weeks ago&quot;; &quot;a few more wagons than usual&quot;; &quot;an invalid's pleasures are few and far between&quot;; &quot;few roses were still blooming&quot;; &quot;few women have led troops in battle&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In absolutely literal sense (or mathematically) 'a couple' would indeed mean 'two'. But anyone with communication skills beyond asking their mum for a sandwich means that 'a couple' is synonym for 'a few' in language.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You kind of cherry picked your definition there. &quot;couple&quot; meaning &quot;few&quot; is really just an idiom. Not incorrect, but the more accepted definition is still two.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zabrinka</div><div class="date">2014-09-30, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is a lawyerly explanation of &quot;couple,&quot; from Bryan Garner (the editor of Black's Law Dictionary and generally recognized as a top U.S. legal writing expert):<br />
<br />
As a noun, “couple” has traditionally denoted a pair. (As a verb, it always denotes the joining of two things.) But in some uses, the precise number is vague. Essentially, it’s equivalent to “a few” or “several.” In informal contexts this usage is quite common and unexceptionable — e.g.:<br />
<br />
o “Those most anxious should practice at least once in front of a couple of people to be comfortable with an audience.” Molly Williamson, “Unlocking the Power of Public Speaking,” Milwaukee J. Sentinel, 15 Sept. 2002, at L12.<br />
<br />
o “This slick, cozy shop, which underwent a makeover a couple of years back, is a hybrid of takeout and restaurant.” A.C. Stevens, “Why Cook Tonight?” Boston Herald, 15 Sept. 2002, Food §, at 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the feeling I get from it too. Previously just responding to the person that actually said that couple &quot;does not&quot; mean two. It may have other meanings, but it definitely also means two :D</div></div><hr />

Do you mean on October 14th when they announce when 6.0 will be enabled in game? The expansion has been announced already. I'd wager probably that 6.0 comes that week or the next, and at the most when they hand out titles and mounts.</div></div><hr />

They announce the pvp season end 2 weeks prior to its closure,which happened now.That means the pvp season ends on 14 october,which is in 6.0.</div></div><hr />

As noted below this doesn't always have to mean 2. Plus, if it was a hard 2 wouldn't Blizzard have just said, &quot;6.0.2 will be on live servers in 2 weeks. Trust me, I want this on live servers just as much as anyone. I am just feeling a little soured that we have had MoP for 2 years now.<br />

They gave us the CM early warning last week but still didn't give us a hard date.<br />

Im all in all pretty happy with it and looking forward to my main getting gutteg because of QQ and slight overpowerdness.<br />

What to do... just wait and see and everything will turn out great.<br />

Yeah no offense, but if you've only gotten 9/14HC in 3 months, those people you're recruiting are not exactly mythic quality.</div></div><hr />

As if you'd need to clear all bosses of a difficulty within a short time to be &quot;quality&quot; for that mode. As long as your group is tackling content that is appropriate for their skill level and doesn't start slacking, who cares if you've downed 9 or 14 HC (soon to be Mythic) in the end? You still raid that difficulty for the major part of the content, so you're a Mythic raider.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well my point was more based on the fact that this content has been around now for over a year, and with the item level increase due to 4 upgrades, and the fact that people have killed these bosses so many times now, if they can only manage 9 bosses (Which are very easy compared to the last 3) then they're going to struggle with current-content mythic with appropriate gear levels.</div></div><hr />

They're called a pair of pants because they're made of 2 independently joined legs. Just like a pair of glasses is 2 lenses and pair of scissors is 2 blades etc.</div></div><hr />

That day is coming for wow if they just take its customers for granted. 6-13 million people at 15 bucks a month......and nooo content during the worst xpac ever. Really Blizz, you cant think of some better pvp ideas. Take the most popular FPS maps ever made, convert them to WOW maps and do wow deathmatch 100 deaths wins with cool rooms, I DONT KNOW i aint the designers but man think of something other than announcing the end of an arena season like its a big fucking deal. And I am shocked that no one rages about them &quot;having&quot; to close down arena and rated battlegrounds after this because you know there is so much to do during prepatch for players. Blizz is lucky that no one has come out with a polished mmo...</div></div><hr />

Yes for those items who dont require a rating you didnt earn. E.g., min conquest points for weapons and gem, ratings for elite gear and enchants.</div></div><hr />

9/14HC is still more progression than the majority of groups. Might not be up to your special snowflake standards, but they have every right to be happy about creating a new team, which is hard enough to do at end of expac and downing some heroic bosses. <br />
<br />
Roster issues are a thing this late in the expac. Not everyone jumps to the #1 guild on the server. Although that did happen magically on our server. The minute the first guild got Garrosh down ppl started jumping ship. It was insane how many guilds had to redo rosters Bc if it. And go figure, a lot wanted to come back when they realized there wasn't really a spot for them. Those of us who stayed are fine with what we accomplished. Some people wanna do it for themselves. And there's nothing wrong with that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really weird at all since they display 20 comments per page. I have had it happen to be many many times, I just never bothered to say anything. It is specific to clicking on the comments from front page. If I had to guess the navigation area is part of the comment display iteration, thus if there is not any comments displayed there is no navigation code displayed. If that is true, it should be relatively trivial to fix.</div></div><hr />

As much as i dislike MOP Arenas, 4 weeks of doing nothing(remember, you'll have to wait over a month for the new season to begin), is just f boring.<br />
I would much rather play this season till Draenor release(13-11), then take a week or 2 to go 90-100+get the honor gear, then start arenas right away again.</div></div><hr />
