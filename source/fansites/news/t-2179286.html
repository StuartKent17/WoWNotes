Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Picture yourself still as a Blizzard designer. Now, you just got the news that a few more competitive guilds are leaving the progression races because there’s no incentive to do that. You can’t change the situation because it depends on structure and decisions that are bigger than you. How would you, Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street feel? What would be your thoughts? Can we get a glimpse of GC’s mind in that hypothetical moment for a second, just for curiosity? <br />
Being in a competitive raiding guild, one that has a legit chance of getting a world first, can be a brutal situation. The expectations for the time you put in are enormous, and real life with its annoying things like “jobs” and “families” can really get in the way. The stress is high. In my experience, those guilds are often held together by the sheer force of will of a few officers or perhaps as a few as one really strong leader. The pressure on that person is enormous, and the guild is very fragile if that person decides he or she has had enough.<br />
<br />
I always admired progressive-oriented guilds a lot, but I knew I could never be in one. (I was in really hardcore guilds for years, but never thought we’d get a world first.)<br />
<br />
So I would not necessarily look at a guild going casual or disbanding as a sign that there is something wrong with the game. I don’t know what’s going on in WoW right now, so I can’t say that definitively. But when it happened while I worked on WoW, we never said “We have to make changes because guilds are giving up.” We tried to do what we could to make life easier on them for things like lockout times and loot distribution and stuff like that. But when you’re going into content dramatically undergeared (in that the later fights are designed around the assumption that you farm the earlier ones for weeks), AND you want to progress as fast as possible, or at least faster than rival guilds, that is an enormous ton of pressure.

Healing from Inspiring Presence does not generate threat.<br />

Why even put the thought into fixing this. How much extra threat could this even create and does it really put warriors at an advantage?</div></div><hr />

Right now Warriors have a tendency to rip threat from Druids in seconds because of the threat discrepancy. This tones that down a little without impacting mainline abilities.</div></div><hr />

he and one of the devs from riot traded spots (that dev kick started the team on heros of the storm) also yes we have heared of people fired from blizz (there is tons of people fired but they are just lower workers who no ones knows) but there was that community manager that had a mental breakdown and got fired<br />

<br />
A massive desire by who exactly? The ~10k players? <br />
<br />
No one cares about Vanilla servers, if you miss it so badly, go play private. I'd much rather blizzard focus on new things than allocate resources for old crap people will play for 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
pointed at you and nuMbxx<br />
<br />
they will (99%) never make legacy<br />
the reason why is because the people cannot agree what they want<br />
<br />
<br />
do they want progressive? reach the end of vanilla then move to TBC? or do they want it to just hault at the end of vanilla?<br />
do they want bug fixes? or are they &quot;part of the experience&quot;<br />
do they want class balance? so you can play more then 1 of 2 talent builds in raid?<br />
do they want the new models?<br />
do they want QoL?<br />
- earlier mounting<br />
-faster out of combat regen<br />
-slower mob respawns in raid<br />
-more graveyards?<br />
at what rate to they want patches?<br />
-faster<br />
-slower<br />
-the same?<br />
allow server/faction transfer?<br />
able to transfer things obtained to retail? like if i obtain corrupted ashbringer, or the teir 3, will i be able to use them as mog on retail? same with mounts? like the black battle tank?<br />
<br />
<br />
heres the thing, the legacy community cannot agree on these.... and thats why blizz cant... because there is so many different opinions, and with something like vanilla, these things can make or break it, people who want the EXACT, people who want the exact but with some things to make it look nicer and things less annoying<br />
<br />
<br />
the legacy community is a minority, and this community has its own minorities...<br />
those who want vanilla<br />
those who want BC<br />
those who want WotLK<br />
those who want progressive<br />
those who want QoL changes<br />
those who want visual upgrades<br />

I would actually want WotLK server era to see again the world and zones before cataclysm. Because cataclysm screwed up leveling (without heirlooms). You just overlevel zones doing normal quest routes. I liked lvling new character before cata... After it is afk dungeon spam in SW.</div></div><hr />

you still can lvl up without heirloom no one forcing you to use them also u can get out of SW and lvl up like you used 2 no one forcing you to stay afk and spam for Q</div></div><hr />

<br />
And after doing 30-40% quests in a zone i outlevel it. So i skip rest of the zone and move to the next. Rinse and repeat. Before cata i just naturally finish one zone and hit enough lvl to move to the next. It was simple and natural progression. <br />
Also miss the old zone questlines :(</div></div><hr />

I would actually want WotLK server era to see again the world and zones before cataclysm. Because cataclysm screwed up leveling (without heirlooms). You just overlevel zones doing normal quest routes. I liked lvling new character before cata... After it is afk dungeon spam in SW.<br />
<br />
I can understand that. I always played Alliance, since vanilla, i figured I could play the Horde 1-60 game anytime, which I planned to, but never got around to. Cata killed that, sadly.<br />
<br />
But, the overwhelming opinion on leveling seems to be that it's an annoyance, so I don't think making new characters take 27 days to level to 60 would go over too well with the &quot;Gogogogo&quot; crowd that seems to be what's left of the playerbase. <br />
<br />
They are aware of the problem, Ion has touched on it several times. The puzzle of how to populate the lower levels of the game is probably the hardest one, because everyone tries to blow through it as fast as possible. And without players in the zones, at the appropriate levels, it will never truly come close to a vanilla experience. <br />
<br />
One thing that could work is zone scaling - make all zones, whether it's Stranglethorn, Hellfire Peninsula, or the Borean Tundra, scale to the player's level. That was you could choose what zone and story to level in. But, I doubt they'd redo all the new 1-60 cata quests, which is a shame, while some of them are fun, the original content was far better, with the notable exceptions of the Fedex quests. <br />
<br />
The next expansion could implement it, and using the class/garrison table mechanic, send players to all of the different zones, you'd never have a repeat with that much content to put quests into.<br />
<br />
Imagine if you and your friends are around level 92, and want to do a dungeon...and you can pick any of the dungeons up to that level, and they will scale for you. Even better if the drops scale for you too. <br />
<br />
As for legacy, I think if they had something to announce, they would have done it by now. Who knows?</div></div><hr />

About the anounce i think they would do that on Blizzcon this year. Last year was packed with Legion stuff so they dont wanted to derail expansion maybe? <br />
<br />
I like your suggestion with scaling content - thing is, im still unable to check cataclysm zone stories most of the time because i outlevel them. So it is lose-lose situation. I cant go back to the wotlk era zone because cata revamped them and i cant check cata zone stories because they are so bad scaled. <br />
<br />
Hell, even option to lock xp gain when we reach zone max lvl would make me happy. Just anything really. <br />
<br />
When i was doing some herbalism stuff recently i get a quest to travel to stranglethorn vale, more specifically - booty bay. And get hit right into the feels. The oldschool look of the trees, grass, beaches, low textures everywhere. It was glorious. I remembered when i was playing my fire mage in BC and needed to drink after burning down 3 raptors. <br />
<br />
I dont want the game to go back to that style in modern content. But wow is such a massive game with over 100 milion players played it at one time or the other, it sprawls 13 years being in the main stage, being the center of the spotlight. People grow up, make families, heir priorities shifted, it was bad and good. And wow was always there. It is a part of many people life, maybe closed chapter, maybe open. <br />
<br />
Honestly, I believe that giving player options to revisit old wow is the way to go. For me it would be leveling once again and feeling wonders of winterspring. Killing raptors in mulgore and stranglethorn vale. Visiting glorious ashenvale forests. Going into tirisfall glades. Getting angry at alliance, because they legitimatly screwed up Edwin van Cleaf. Uncovering the conspiracy in Orgrimmar. Seeing non-jesus thrall model. <br />
<br />
As i said. Right into the feels :(</div></div><hr />
