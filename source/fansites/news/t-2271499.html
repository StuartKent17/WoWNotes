Legion PvP Season 4 Ending Soon!<br />
Soon the gates will close on Legion PvP Season 4 for all Arena and Battleground competitors.<br />
<br />
Season 4 – End of Season Rewards<br />
If you participated in Season 4, to ensure you receive the rewards that you’re due, please keep the following in mind:<br />
<br />
<br />
Refrain from transferring your character(s) to another realm or faction until after Legion Season 4 has ended.<br />
Legion Season 4 titles and mounts will be awarded approximately two weeks after the season ends.<br />
<br />
<br />
Faction-Based Rewards<br />
Don’t forget—end-of-season rewards are based on your faction. If you transfer your character to the other faction, you must have 50 wins after your transfer to receive the reward. You must have 150 wins for Gladiator and Cruel Gladiator.<br />
<br />
When the last sounds of clashing weapons fade, how will you measure up this season?<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Could the Black Transmutagen alchemy reagent have a vendor sell price? We get far too many with almost no way to use up!<br />
All transmutagens can be vendored in 7.3.Thanks! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/892090959852322825))<br />

What does Sargeras do in his pasttime?<br />
Drives the lore community insane (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/892120270785265664))<br />
<br />
Is the Celestial Calf supposed to be cageable and resellable on 7.3 PTR? Sounds like a bug.<br />
This change has been reverted. You can still collect three of them now in 7.3. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/892147633967452160))<br />

The Netherlight Crucible And You<br />
I'm...even more confused...<br />
TLDR:<br />
<br />
Before the patch, if you get a relic that doesn't have the trait you want, you throw it away.<br />
<br />
After the patch, if you get a relic that doesn't have the trait you want, you can plug it into the Netherlight Crucible and maybe get it anyway.<br />
<br />
That's about all there is to it! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1068882-the-netherlight-crucible-and-you/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20758616309?page=1#7))<br />

It still baffles me that despite how strict Blizz has been to sticking to their 11 week schedule, there are people out there who still believe 7.3 won't come out for another few months.</div></div><hr />

Not entirely, CRZ is allowing multiple people from different servers to play in the same zone on the same &quot;server&quot; at a time. Sharding is only allowing X number of people in a zone at a time and when that number is reached creating a mirror server of that zone to put new people in. CRZ is to help low pop areas, Sharding is to prevent congestion and lag.</div></div><hr />

Yes 910 relics which for the argus raid is 35 ilevels below heroic and 50 below mythic. So for heroic or better raiders its basically useless.<br />
Yeah I know it will be almost good enough until the new raid hits.<br />
<br />
<br />

So your complaint is that heroic or better raiders can't get gear at the level of the next raid? That's a bit weird ain't it?<br />
Or are you complaining that you actually have to raid heroic or better to get heroic or better gear? <br />
If you are complaining about drop chances: So is everything else. Especially trinkets. That's how gear from raids work...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah shockingly bad to design a 'random' system on top of a very low chance random drop!<br />
<br />
Which is kind of the point of the Netherlight cubicle to actually remove (or lessen) the &quot;random system&quot; that is on top of the random drop chance (it's actually not lower than other drops, it's just RNG, so you might perceive it as lower).</div></div><hr />

For some classes a high level relic with a shit trait is less desirable than a low level relic with the best trait, but I suppose if you play one of the classes where the higher ilvl the better I guess it would be useless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So you really believe that a random system will get classes to equip a +1 relic that has the wrong trait hoping that it rolls good on the netherlight crucible. <br />
For most players it would require that they knew what they would be getting before discarding a good trait.<br />
<br />
So tbh it sounds more like it will be a case of: Finally get a good trait relic, fell bad when it rolls a bad trait on the crucible.<br />
Add that to the fact that relevant ilevel relics have extremely low drop chance to begin with. <br />
<br />
So be real here, most people clearing their current raid every week without split farming they might get a relic once a month. <br />
They will most likely not try to gamble by replacing a good trait just because there is a chance that the crucible might roll a good one.<br />
<br />
So this once a month 'if lucky' relic has to have one of the better traits, roll good on the crucible and preferably warforge or better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. Blizzard is attempting to gaslight its playerbase into believing the crucible is a better system with less RNG when it has even MORE RNG than current. Everyone has multiple good traits and if your relic doesn't hit 3 good traits then it's worthless. This is inventing for the sake of inventing, there is zero innovation at play with this system. Reforging worked and compared to what we have now would be far less time consuming and frustrating. Blizzard tries to explain away reforging as &quot;too complicated&quot; and &quot;raid disruptive&quot; when this is going cause all the problems of reforging with none of the benefits.<br />
<br />
I'll be shocked if we don't see reforging return next expansion and Blizzard try to tout it as a great innovation, lol.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe you can inspect the relic before you actually place it in your weapon. You're complaining about an issue that isn't present.</div></div><hr />
