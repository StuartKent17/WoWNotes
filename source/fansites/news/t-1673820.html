Faction Balance in PvP<br />
There are only 15 horde characters in the top 500 in the pvp bracket.. Fix it, fix it now.<br />
Because Arena can have the same faction facing each other in a match, all of the high end players tend to gravitate to one faction or the other so they can play with each other. Last season pretty much everyone in NA was Horde, and EU was Alliance. Regardless of if a race or faction is considered to have superior racials the ladders would still show an all-in approach on one or the other. You could completely remove racials and still see the same coordinated division. Feedback on Racials is welcome and considered, but for the outlined reasons showing the best players coordinating toward a single faction isn't by itself a good indicator of anything except for the nature of the top competitors looking to play and practice with each other. It's going to happen regardless of pretty much anything else.<br />
<br />
Does that mean that people who want to play with better players, should pay for a faction switch to Alliance then?<br />
Anyone can level a new character any time they want. It's pretty quick, too! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/355847-posting-again-to-let-blizzard-know/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15700234076?page=5#87))<br />

ok 244 followers at the inn 1 per week we will be into the next xp by the time we get them all over sight or what ?<br />
Not reeeaaally intended to be a collection-y system. If you really want them all it could take a while. Okay with that. Highest achievement for collecting them is for 40 Followers, so, yeah. Collect 'em if you want to.<br />
then why put so many in ?<br />

<br />
Almost every class has a stun. Normally it's 4-5 seconds though. It's a really great CC in my opinion (no, i don't play rogue).<br />
Be happy they nerfed it instead of crying. Not every CC should break on dmg. That would be boring.</div></div><hr />

Making an alt doesn't feel like it should be the ultimate answer there, even if you can do so for now. :)<br />
<br />
I like racials a lot, but I feel like it'd be cool if you got a little racial talent tree to select from a bunch of ones, so that you could craft any race to be good at what you're focusing on while still keeping some flavour. Actually i think it would also improve the flavour of races in general, if you had a few more slots to add traits. Imagine being able to pick plainsrunning as Tauren, etc.<br />
<br />
As for warlocks, I feel the main lacking thing is well, feel. Still enjoy mine, but I can't deny every patch since early MoP has systematically cleaved away at the warlock, even if it was warranted in some ways. Just, now you are left with something that feels extremely barebones. I mean... like the RoF embers for Destruction. Great synergy mechanic, one of many such to get the axe because of numbers you could tune in other ways instead.</div></div><hr />

I know right, especially when it takes about 100 hours of playtime to reach max level. They consider that no time at all? There's atleast 20 hours of grinding gear after that.<br />

It has been the same since Wotlk.<br />
Wasn't a problem back then, in cata, in mop, isn't a problem now.<br />
<br />
It's just that &lt;1800 people didn't like to lose to a combat rogue now that the specc FINALLY got some representation in PVP.<br />
<br />
But being completely blown into pieces by Hunter + Retris unhealable damage and unavoidable CC is completely fine, BUT THAT 8 SEC STUN GOTTA GO! Because the grass is greener on the other side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most reasonable Warlocks out there are not complaining about the damage (which might or might not be a bit low), but about the general state of the class. <br />
Affliction: Dead, with the removal of snapshotting of dots, the specc died not just a little. There is no challenging gameply in it, only the prayer to allmighty Randor (the god of RNG) to keep Haunt up as much as possible<br />
Destruction: The removal of ember-generation from Rain of Fire was bad. Don't get me wrong, it did too much damage and was used in single target rotation which it should not. But now, to be able to AoE properly you need to hit about 8 targets.<br />
Demonology: Loved the specc throughout Patch 5.4, played it much. But the 100 Talent Demonbolt is horrible, you no longer have to make decissions what to do with your fury, but only cast your Demonbolt 3 to 4 times every 45 seconds and if you miss a window for it, your DPS goes significantly down. To make things worse, Demonbolt is a talent which you are forced to take if you want to be competitive (at least in single target).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You sir, deserve a medal ! <br />
Sarcasm off now: Warlocks don't ask for damage buffs, but to fix the clunckyness which the speccs have become, and the horrible talent tree where half can't be used in conjuction with another talent. They got an overhaul in MoP and just reverted 90% of the changes done there and removed DoT-snapshotting all along too.<br />
People who have no clue about how a Class plays or know what the Class' community thinks and wants, please just go hide under a rock and never come back since you're making a fool of yourself.</div></div><hr />

The talents are as bad as ever, no surprise there. It was the same in MoP where all 3 talents at launch were absolute dogshit ( aside from Manorroth in CMs) and the same goes on again.<br />
Although I would like to have some stuff Blizz smokes with the joke glyphs they just introduced: as someone who played the class for years it is obvious that some are deliberate traps to fuck people up but for a newcomer for example might not be the case.</div></div><hr />

Go and get your eyes tested please.<br />
<br />
Test your knowledge please, there are no hybrid classes. No one can tank/dps, or tank/heal, or dps/heal with the same spec at the same time.<br />
<br />
They're gone and if there is a class/spec that can do two roles @100% efficiency at once, report it so they can fix. No &quot;they can heal&quot; excuses since every DPS can basically heal himself up without a problem (and &quot;pures&quot; shouldn't even be able to do it without using bandages if you're so inclined to go hybrid/pure route).<br />
<br />
Some classes give you a choice of role to fill, others give you a choice of flavor to do one role. A &quot;pure&quot; dps will never have to hear &quot;go reroll/tank/heal because your dps spec is broken/useless in this fight&quot;.<br />
<br />
And no, Warlocks aren't the worst dps. Not even close to that. They simple don't roflstomp everyone else all the time anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
6 secs is still a lot considering the amount of dmg they dish out (plus, not breaking from dmg), and other CCs.<br />
<br />
That's the fun part of the QQ about a class that is doing fine (and actually needed to be tuned instead of just buffed) and players want more. They will make Blizzard finally notice a few things that they should have fixed some time ago... reminds me of when rogues are one of the best designed classes and ppl still QQ &quot;no rogue changes?!&quot; while Blizzard is focused reworking messed broken classes/specs. Hope it's not over, there are still things they should tune on rogues... and they're not increases...<br />
<br />
Far better to have way too many (and unnoticed by devs) tools and dmg for pvp (and be king there because of OPness) and also do fine in pve than wanting to be the king of pve recounts all the time, everywhere, every type of fight, and start loosing your power in pvp.<br />
<br />
But keep QQing, all the other classes will be more than happy to help devs notice these balance oversights like they're doing now with the stun. The moment they buffed, without need, the dmg, ppl started to QQ about the stun duration and they nerfed right away, lol.<br />

Increasing the trap radius would only make trap stealing worse. I take you're one of the guys that got your savage bloods that way then.<br />
<br />
Read again, increased spawn + tap credit (and the phasing system for maps). There are more than one elite creature to trap for savage bloods and more than one location to hunt one. You won't have ppl just running around throwing traps everywhere (and some ppl that couldn't even fight an elite by themselves) anymore.</div></div><hr />

You CANNOT steal another players trap FFS. Multiple players (even ungrouped) can trap THE SAME BEAST.<br />
Why are people so dense and don't get that?! Did wow archaic tapping system really make people so paranoid that they panic when they see another player in the vicinity?!<br />
<br />
You see a player hitting a mob. You help him to bring it below 50%, but be careful not to pull aggro.<br />
You then wait for him to lay his trap(s). <br />
When he pulls his mob in and it triggers, you plant your trap on top of it and also get credit.<br />
<br />
SO MUCH BETTER than OMG OMG MUST CAST AE EVERY FUCKING GCD SO I GET TAP AND NOT THE OTHER GUY!<br />
<br />
Sadly Blizzard is too incompetent to code grouping so it doesn't kick you out of all kinds of queues, so grouping up is not an option for many players.<br />
<br />
The real problem is not multiple people trapping it is retards taunting / knockbacking the mob away to grief. THAT needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you've apparently never had a run in with a jackass hunter who likes to sit and watch you beat a mob down, then distracting shot it into their own trap. Why the hell should I have to worry about placing my trap properly after someone pulls a stunt like that? <br />
<br />
If you can't (or won't) beat down the mob yourself, you don't deserve the trap, and I'm glad to see Blizzard is addressing this act of griefing. It was blatantly obvious that multiple people, especially non grouped, were not intended to be able to trap the same mob, so it was pretty obvious some sort of fix was going to come. The only reason it didn't come earlier was because of the holiday break.<br />
<br />
The fact that it'll now require tap credit means that they're still going to allow multi-trapping, but at least now it'll have to be consensual</div></div><hr />

As I said: Increase trap hitbox, so that trap triggers when it is &quot;under the mob&quot; and not just &quot;under the correct pixel of the mobs underbelly&quot;.<br />
Also: make mobs immune to taunt/distract/knockback etc if not tagged by you.<br />
<br />

That does not fix the griefing problem in any way shape or form, just makes it slightly harder. Requiring tap credit eliminates it entirely. <br />
<br />
You no longer get to waltz right up and get free crafting materials just for showing up while someone else does the work. *That* is the one thing you're neglecting, and something your 'solution' does absolutely nothing to address. You may think it's ok if that happens. I don't. Apparently enough people, or enough people who work for Blizzard, feel the same way. <br />
<br />
My servers trade chat was full of jackasses like you who thought this was a-ok and that they were enjoying the tears of people upset about others getting traps off their work. I think I'll be enjoying the tears of the lazy and/or incapable now that the hammer has dropped.</div></div><hr />

Unless he hinders you to get your trap, him getting freebies is NOT griefing at all.<br />
It might be a dick move if he doesn't help to bring the HP down, I agree, but it doesn't influence you at all, since you get what you came for.<br />
<br />
BTW: tags won't protect you. They can still taunt the mob off and kite it till it resets, enabling them to tag it. Or they can still kill it out of spite just to anger you. THAT is griefing.</div></div><hr />

Also the fact that affliction dots do less than flame shock from a shaman unless you are soul draining is ridiculous. buff dot damage, and take away the extra ticks from drain soul so it feels like a true dot class and not a i have to channel this class.</div></div><hr />

It may be the case that ppl transfer to the same faction to play with each other, but the fact that they don't think racials are a huge reason to why that is, shows me just how much in denial they are. I bet if humans could be druids, NE's population would decrease a lot.</div></div><hr />

Be happy they nerfed it instead of crying. Not every CC should break on dmg. That would be boring.<br />
<br />
The average isn't 4-5 seconds, 4-5 is really strong noteworthy stun, with a prelude of shorter 'meh' worthy stuns, some of which have other features.<br />
<br />
6s is strangely long but I like that it gives rogues something no one else has and think the game should do more of that (to within reason where it's not some stupid OP 8s stun combined with smoke bombs)</div></div><hr />

The first thing was in fact happening. The second thing would actually be referred to as an exploit.<br />
<br />
Initial looting rights to a mob you're not tapped to has almost never been the case in WoW. (I say &quot;almost never&quot; because though I can't remember it ever being the case, there might be one I'm unfamiliar with.) Even with skinning, the person who killed it has to loot it first. The traps were obviously not working as intended, and &quot;the game allows it&quot; has never been considered an acceptable excuse when you find a bug and attempt to gain from it. Blizzard's past responses when they finally addressed it and ended up banning people for it was something akin to, &quot;You should have known better.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had a warlock main since WotLK (and I rolled her in Vanilla, she just wasn't my main). In a way that's true, but I really think the problems with the class atm are more than dps. It's things like RoF nerf and ember generation, and terrible utility - lock rock nerf and gateway nerf should both be reverted to give the class any kind of raid utility again<br />
<br />
At its core, lock just isn't fun right now. Not compared to other classes. I'm having a blast on my hunter, and I'm leveling my mage now and she's great fun as well. Warlock is just... boring, but doesn't make up for it with great dps or utility. I feel like they hit lock hard with the ability bloat purge but didn't compensate in any way, or do it with any finesse.</div></div><hr />

No, actually. They're whining about not being OP. No mobility with a ranged class? You don't say! Roll a melee and stfu.</div></div><hr />

Faction imbalance will always be there to an extent because packs of people follow some of the top players around, but choosing a race shouldn't be about what traits will help you the best in combat, it should be about what race you really identify with at a personal level.</div></div><hr />
