IC_Dsaurfang_IntroAll03 - Hahahaha! Dwarves.<br />
<br />
And somehow turns this into dead orcs having a deep seated racist hatred towards dwarves, it is implied that the lich king's power makes him much bigger, and he mocks us, and calls us &quot;dwarves&quot; because dwarf is a word used to note something smaller in comparison to something else!<br />
<br />
And therefore, it does not mean that Saurfang, or the Saurfang bloodline, or the entire orc race, has a hatred for dwarves.<br />

<br />
SPOILER<br />
<br />
In some of the sound files that are floating around, Saurfang the elder is very much alive after the encounter, saying the words 'behind me lies the body of my son.' Varian (yes, d-bag supremus as we all know him better) actually stays Muradin's hand from killing the grieving Saurfang, saying some astonishingly caring things about a grieving father.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get me wrong, I really do appreciate the extent you go to to provide accurate and extensive info about every facet of WoW, it keeps me going even when I'm not able to play. I sorta fell into the trap that people only speak up when they have a complaint, but if you don't hear it enough, hear it now: THANKS! ;D<br />
<br />
It's just that automatic video streams are a kind of running gag here. :P</div></div><hr />

IC_Dsaurfang_IntroAll03 - Hahahaha! Dwarves.<br />
<br />
And somehow turns this into dead orcs having a deep seated racist hatred towards dwarves, it is implied that the lich king's power makes him much bigger, and he mocks us, and calls us &quot;dwarves&quot; because dwarf is a word used to note something smaller in comparison to something else!<br />
<br />
And therefore, it does not mean that Saurfang, or the Saurfang bloodline, or the entire orc race, has a hatred for dwarves.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
-PS- Also Betty Crocker.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think he yells that because Bronzebeard yells CHARGE! and then Saurfang I guess levitates them and has them in some type of choke hold when he says IC_Dsaurfang_IntroAll03 - Hahahaha! Dwarves.</div></div><hr />

In some of the sound files that are floating around, Saurfang the elder is very much alive after the encounter, saying the words 'behind me lies the body of my son.' Varian (yes, d-bag supremus as we all know him better) actually stays Muradin's hand from killing the grieving Saurfang, saying some astonishingly caring things about a grieving father.<br />

Again, the way it was posted had him in the middle of a speech then all of the sudden he screams like he was stabbed or something. Either way, dies or doesn't die, we all know he won't be in the picture in cataclysm if Garrosh is leader.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds like Saurfang Jr. injures him and takes him out of the fight in some way, and then the heroes (you) have to fight him. Afterwards, we get more soundclips of Varian and Muradin speaking about and to Saurfang Sr., so it's implied he's alive after the fight, though almost certainly injured, because it sounds like Muradin wanted to coup de grasie him and finish him off, but Varian stopped him. I still think something might happen with Garrosh to make him seem like a more likely warchief than people are expecting, especially now that I'm starting to see Varian portrayed a lot differently than he has been in the past. That said... where the hell has Garrosh BEEN in all of this anyways</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
it is implied that the lich king's power makes him much bigger, and he mocks us, and calls us &quot;dwarves&quot; because dwarf is a word used to note something smaller in comparison to something else!<br />
<br />
Actually, someone called JoeShmoe64 describes the Alliance intro like this (http://www.wow.com/2009/11/13/patch-3-3-ptr-deathbringer-saurfang-impressions/comments/23084425/): <br />
As Alliance players start the event (and I was watching a stream, so I can only guess that you talk to Muradin), Saurfang Jr. walks out from the door and gives a speech about how when each person fell in all these petty conflcts, they were fodder for the Lich King's armies etc, etc. Muradin yells &quot;A lone orc? Against the might of the Alliance? CHAAAAAAAAARGE!&quot; Saurfang, more powerful than previous DKs, begins to force choke the entire army at the same time, and they float up into the air, whilst our favorite undead orc gives the best line ever: &quot;Hahahaha......dwarves....&quot; and then you engage him.<br />
<br />
So yes, he means dwarves as in members of that race. Not that this would be racist in any way, it's just a description.</div></div><hr />
