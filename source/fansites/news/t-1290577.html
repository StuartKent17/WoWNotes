Patch 5.3 - The Secrets of Ragefire Scenario<br />
Today we take a look at one of the shorter scenarios added in Patch 5.3, The Secrets of Ragefire. The Gob Squad has tracked the people that disappeared from Durotar to Ragefire Caverns, a supposedly abandoned section of Ragefire. After blowing open the door, you will find a large cavern filled with Kor'kron that are hostile. <br />
<br />
The first miniboss you fight is Dark Shaman Xorenth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/70683-dark-shaman-xorenth), presumably related to the low level friendly quest NPC Invoker Xorenth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/61716-invoker-xorenth). The Gob Squad warns him that Goblins are not his enemy, and he responds by calling them a lesser race. <br />
<br />
After disposing of Xorenth, you look through piles of things around the cavern, such as discarded artifacts from the digsite in Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Another set of crates contains Kor'kron weapons and supplies, with the text &quot;From the look of things, Garrosh is planning an invasion&quot;. The third thing you come across is Proto-drake eggs, causing one of the goblins to suggest that Garrosh may be working with the Dragonmaw. <br />
<br />
Upon noticing a large door on the other side of the cavern, Ticker produces a Mantid bomb, which you collect parts to help and modify (including a pony (https://twitter.com/WoWDB/status/322035447922561024)). Unfortunately the bomb has no effect on the door, only inuring the other members of the Gob Squad. More Kor'Kron attack while the remaining members of the Gob Squad build a teleporter to escape and tell Vol'jin what you have seen. <br />

any ideas on making casters actually go oom aside from healers? Atm only spriests do. Mages stay full mana<br />
Arcane can run OOM, which is by design. Other casters are not intended to. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325304959732174848))<br />

Are you happy with Death Knight's Rune enchanting?<br />
No. We've had long-term plans to revisit it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325332972200931328))<br />

can you elaborate on the reason for the feral buffs? (or point to somewhere they've been discussed)<br />
We thought their sustained DPS was a little low. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324706123884134400))<br />
<br />
No changes to resto Druids? like we do need some changes cant just forsake us because a new class for the same niche is out<br />
We don't make changes to every spec for the sake of it. Many players focus way too much on number of patch notes per class. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324699783388344320))<br />
However, having said that, we did make some Resto druid changes just today. You'll see them soon. As ever, nothing is final in 5.3. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324700529257226241))<br />

Any info on the Wild Quiver data mine? Curious as to if it's a tool tip fix or a hint at something new.<br />
Just a bug fix to make the effect use the correct weapon. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325000596765700097))<br />

the TeB change on MMO champ has left the entire monk community in confusion.. care to elaborate? nerf? buff? confused.<br />
Bug fix. All of that is to prevent monks from benefiting from mastery before level 80 (when they don't have mastery). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325033359573123072))<br />

Holy Paladin T15 4pc is incredibly weak, a 20% bonus on something that makes up 5% of our healing? Offset pieces are better.<br />
5% from Beacon? That seems low to me. 10%+ is more typical. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325330207319945216))<br />

Any plans for holy priests 5.3 (chakra rework maybe?) if not any future plans? Would love to see some changes soon.<br />
Not for 5.3. Long term we'd like to keep the idea of Chakra but make it easier to use and more fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325305975286407168))<br />
<br />
Are you really nerfing Smite by a flat 20% with the glyph change? It's already the weakest spell in Atonement by far... ugh.<br />
Atonement is really overpowered. We're trying to nerf it without removing all of its fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324701558539427842))<br />
<br />
It might just be a tool-tip change. If not, why nerf the damage of Penance? Disc damage in PvP is already garbage.<br />
We want to make sure healing someone with Penance heals more than Atonement DPS with Penance. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324701059618578435))<br />

As I read the 5.3 patch notes, once you activate Fire &amp; Brimstone you have to exhaust your embers to turn it off. Correct?<br />
It will auto turn off, but you can also click off the buff or just click the spell again to toggle it off. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325001406731927554))<br />

So when is the minimum range for Heroic Leap going to go away?<br />
It's not. That would be more of a Heroic Hop. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325304008313028609))<br />
<br />
Why the change to Enraged Regen for Warriors? I'm not a fan of it myself.<br />
Curious as to why. Overall, the feedback was that having to cache rage for an emergency button was hard to use. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325001631156539392))<br />
<br />
Character<br />
You dislike the idea of account-wide gear. Is that why its taking so long for cross realm BoAs?<br />
I dislike shifting lots of gear to be BoA. I like existing BoA gear being easy to transfer to all your characters. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324325203964461057))<br />
<br />
Well since you seem to like to deflect your failures in MoP, lets ask why everything in WoW is still BoP. Make stuff BoE.<br />
There is a big risk there of making the AH the best way to gear. Another recent game had this problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325029719709999104))<br />
I'd love it if bop items that haven't been equipped could be mailed between chars and only locked if equipped<br />
We dabble with that, but it ultimately means your hunter gets all geared up without you ever having to actually play them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325037528862302210))<br />
<br />
Do you think that all players are able to play 12 hours a day to get a better gear ? I don't have so much time.<br />
You can make progress at whatever rate you are comfortable playing. You just won't make the fastest progress. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324324955288387584))<br />
<br />
Could you explain why we can't use legendary meta in upgraded 504 helms? It seems a little silly.<br />
The intent was always for Throne of Thunder helms. Apologies that we did not communicate that intent well. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324324200875712513))<br />
<br />
I have almost never tweeted. Please never allow this. No one will have anything but legendaries. Be more creative.<br />
To devil's advocate, players might also get sick of them if everyone has them. The same happened to paly T2. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324215559107526657))<br />
<br />
Have you discussed maybe making thunderforged items not upgradeable? You could make non tfed gear turn into tfed after upgrade<br />
The main goal with Tforged was to keep those earlier bosses still feel exciting. If Tforge was just Valor savings not sure. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324703170779570177))<br />
<br />
I have a reputation on my realm. (community) Thats useless in LFR. (anti social concept)<br />
Agree that LFR is an anti-social concept. To be fair, that's not it's goal though and the benefits far outweigh that cost. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325037032722280448))<br />
But we realize we have some work to do to get the social elements back into the game. Cutting LFR just isn't among our options. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325037217351348224))<br />
<br />
wow needs a decent guildfinder tool. XRealm and Armory linked either through the website or in game (or both)<br />
Yeah, we agree. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325335253436739584))<br />
<br />
community in wow has severely degraded with lfd/r. could they at least try to prioritize same realm groups?<br />
They do. It's just a compromise to avoid players having excessively long queue times. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325307846449328129))<br />
<br />
Loot is a bonus to raiding. A community is a must have for an MMO. Otherwise we have only LFR/LFG, no guilds.<br />
My personal conviction is you will have more fun playing WoW with friends. Solo LFR is for when that isn't feasible. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325037878222667776))<br />
<br />
There's currently a bug with rppm trinkets which let's you guarantee a proc on pull if you don't release after wipe, Fix inc?<br />
You'll get a proc pretty quickly regardless - should be within seconds, just not necessarily the very first hit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325305127219130369))<br />
<br />
PPM bad-streak protection, does it suggest a 5 min break between pulls is optimal? It promotes boring gameplay if so. <br />
If you are out of combat for even a minute, you should get the hit on one of your first few attacks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325002466775154688))<br />
This is true for fast trinkets like the 3.3 RPPM Agi ones, but a UVLS user has to wait many minutes for the bonus.<br />
Should only be true of your very first attack. It will still proc in the first few seconds. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325035091128614912))<br />
<br />
at the bmah i see a lot of brawler guild invites noone bids for. Is it probably not as successfull as you planned?<br />

<br />
I joined a LFR tonight on Lei Shen. I was polite, friendly and keen to learn the tactics, and even cracked a few jokes. The responses I got you would think no one had seen a friendly player before. (Literally several whispers and some /instance comments...) Perhaps that just highlights the very negative social experience people expect from these environments.

This is another of &quot;if pigs had wings&quot; things. If all people were nice and friendly and wouldn't have the tendency to auto-segregate themselves from others, then realm communities would work. Problem is, most people don't behave that way on the Internet when their number reaches a certain critical mass. Which WoW crossed long ago. :(<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I joined a LFR tonight on Lei Shen. I was polite, friendly and keen to learn the tactics, and even cracked a few jokes. The responses I got you would think no one had seen a friendly player before. (Literally several whispers and some /instance comments...) Perhaps that just highlights the very negative social experience people expect from these environments. Its a shame, because half of them may never experience the funship and comradeship of proper guild raiding.<br />
Yes, I saw that happened as well. We got a friendly tank once in LFR and people were like &quot;omg, a friendly player&quot;. Alas, basic psychology has that people will remember negative experiences more than positive ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't propose removing LFR, but be interested in seeing what Blizzard suggests.<br />
&quot;That's a verrrry good question, cadet&quot; (c) <br />
Frankly, there is not much that can be done in a massively multiplayer game to make people not behave like a-holes. Heck, other games have the same issue, people will insult each other for nothing and all the rest of it, just because they can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I stopped playing right after christmas because there was no reward. No lie, 4 weeks in a row of not a single raid drop in LFR or normal modes. Got sick of grinding dailies and raiding with no rewards. Longest I've been without WoW in 5 years.<br />

You're paying to access the game, not for content. That money funds expansions and other games, both of which you have to pay for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So how did they fund all those things before all the blizzard store crap?, i'm curious because it seems suddenly the microtransactions are the thing that funds the entire blizzard.<br />
<br />
If it was a buy to play or free to play game you would have been right though, but you pay a fixed amount of money each month already which should be more than enough to give content for free.</div></div><hr />

Apparently our subscription money is only enough to fund the scaling down of existing models as pets.</div></div><hr />

It's just Folk really, Folk metal would be Korpiklaani, and others. While it's a nice song, it's not even close to metal :p</div></div><hr />

Probably his model is too detailed to just scale down. A rework would likely be required. So ... either Blizzard Store or WoW Anniversary - I leaning toward the former given that they couldn't even be assed to do something new last WoW anniversary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the pet isn't required to play the game, it's not needed to do dungeons, it's not needed to raid, it's not needed to do anything other then pet battles, and pet battles are a mini game inside the game, and have no story or lore or anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, don't tell me what I pay for. You may pay to access the game, I pay for content. If they didn't give us patches (content) then I wouldn't continue to sub. Newsflash, neither would millions of other people. See in the old days, you would pay a flat fee for the game, like super mario bros. That's it, you wouldn't have to pay monthly to play it because that would be stupid. Just like it would be stupid to buy Mop, and then pay monthly for it if t14 was the only raid for two years.<br />
<br />
So, again, I'm paying monthly for content. They are taking our money and using it to pay their employees to create mounts/pets and then selling it back to us. Sure I can afford to pay again for that content, but I refuse to, because it's disgusting.</div></div><hr />

Arcane can run OOM, which is by design. Other casters are not intended to.<br />

<br />
Gee if only there was a way for smaller group content that let people form friendships, recruit for guilds, recruit for raiding and gave people a chance to see how well people played their different roles. You could call them something like &quot;dungeons&quot; and maybe have 5 people at a time run them.<br />
And here's a really radical thought, use an existing game mechanic to help form these smaller groups on individual realms so people would develop reputations with others they see on their own realm. <br />
But then that might require not re-using the same assets over and over and over for the same instances set at varying degrees of difficulty. Because we all know it's far more important that stockholders get 5 cents a share more than it is to try and keep the people actually paying the bills happy.</div></div><hr />
