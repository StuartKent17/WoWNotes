Hunter and Mage Challenge Mode Gear Procs<br />
Tonight we take a look at a little bit more flare for the Challenge Mode gear! Each set has a special proc that will go off during combat or other actions. Some of the sets even have multiple procs or slight variations depending on what you are casting. <br />
<br />
You can find the Challenge Mode set previews on our Challenge Mode Gear page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/932-Challenge-Mode-Armor-Sets), found in the menu in the navbar. Each class has a proc for their set, so keep checking back to see your class's set! <br />

Mists of Pandaria Launch Times<br />
The official Mists of Pandaria launch times are as follows:<br />
<br />
North and Latin American realms - 12:00 a.m. PDT, September 25<br />
European realms - 12:00 a.m. CEST, September 25<br />
Korean/Taiwan realms - 12:00 a.m. KST, September 27<br />
<br />
With this expansion, we’re using a new bit of tech that will unlock the expansion content, make the intro quest magically pop up in your quest log, and allow you to begin playing the expansion immediately without the need to log out and back in. If everything goes as planned this will be a smooth transition to the adventures that await you in the new continent.<br />
<br />
See you in-game!<br />

Favorite In Game Events<br />
I bet this thread will be entirely &quot;OH AHN'QIRAJ WAS GREAT&quot; or &quot;WRATH OMG WE WERE ZOMBIES &lt;-- rehashed Naxx opening with extras&quot;.<br />
I remember these events quite vividly, and I am personally very glad that I got to experience them, but I also remember that not everyone liked them. <br />
<br />
The Gates of Ahn'Qiraj was an absolutely massive event, and it was tremendously awesome if you got to see it. It is totally understandable why so many have fond memories of this event, but it is important to remember that it wasn't peachy for everyone. This was a one-time event that was triggered by the player who held the Scepter of the Shifting Sands, so it was easy to miss out on it if you were not online when it triggered, or if you did not have a character of sufficient high level to go to Silithus. There were quite a few players who voiced their unhappiness about not getting to witness this event after having spent all that time gathering war supplies.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, as you can maybe get from this video, an absolutely enormous number of players gathered in Silithus to witness the event. This unfortunately resulted in heavy lag for many players, and even realm crashes on some realms, which was obviously very frustrating to many as these things interrupted the fun. <br />
<br />
The Zombie Infestation event was much more widely available to players as it was not restricted to high level players only. Since it was also spread out throughout the world of Azeroth over an extended period of time, the chance of missing out on this event was slim to none, which was appreciated by many for sure. This event is remembered fondly, but again it wasn't peachy for everyone. <br />
<br />
Many people were very annoyed that they frequently got interrupted while being in the middle of doing things, and those people who did not have much time to play in general found that they had a hard time completing their usual daily routines within their established and regular time frames, so they were extra frustrated that they could not opt out of the event. <br />
<br />
The Demon invasion prior to The Burning Crusade was best. Demon's laying siege to the city? Holding the line against invaders? Now that was an event. I didn't even know it was coming, and when Kruul turned up at stormwind?<br />
That one was my personal favourite as well... although I also really liked the Cataclysm pre-launch events<br />
<br />
Pre-wrath zombie plague, hands down. It was so damn fun on an RP server. Pity an event like that will never happen again due to all the QQ it caused. The event was like marmite. Either loved it or hated it.<br />
Nobody says that such an event can't happen again in the future, especially if there is a good reason lore-wise to do it, but it would most likely not happen in the exact same format as the Zombie infestation. There would need to be a way to minimise the griefing, which could for an example be done through safe zones, or some sort of immunity buff, or maybe even a way to opt out of the event altogether for those who are simply not interested in it, etc. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236403-your-favorite-pre-event/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5348645926?page=2#25)) <br />

ArenaNet announced Mac support for Guild Wars 2 today using Cider. Anyone who has purchased the game can try it out, but keep in mind it is still in beta. You need Lion or Mountain Lion and a machine from the last year or two to play with reasonable performance. See the full FAQ (http://en.support.guildwars2.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/9231) for more details.<br />

<br />
Monks, specifically Brewmasters, have been on a bit of a rollercoaster in regards to their mitigation. With Stagger being adjusted the way it was, Brewmasters currently take more damage on average than all other tank classes. Are there plans to address this?

I have two: Is there any chance to get an viable warlock demo tanking form in the future? Maybe with 6.0?<br />
<br />
Second question:<br />
Cloth loot tables are usually more or less fucked up. Sometimes there are slots without any gear at all for mages/locks, sometimes there isn't even a single spirit item to be found. Most of the caster have some kind of spirit to hit conversion anyways, rendering hit pretty much redundant for almost everyone. The result is that those two classes that don't have this conversion have some serious troubles to get necklaces/rings or similiar shared loot.<br />
Why just don't get rid of those problems and merge spellhit and spirit already?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Could you imagine to lock new Raids and the additional Heroic-Instances (that get added to update late entrants to newest content) for players who did not clear previous raid contents of the expansion? Like Pre-Quests back in Burning Crusade.<br />
This would clearly extend the feeling of endgame content, because many people (especially these who join in later content patches) just rush to HighLvL and complete the newest content patch without ever having seen older instances and then start to complain about Blizzard not providing enough Endgame-Content...<br />

(Challenge modes will also be nerfed, since if not enough is completing to gold they will stop using it which is the very reason for nerfing heroic raiding)<br />
Did it ever cross your mind that it's perfectly acceptable that not every single player out there must raid, yet your trying to funnel everyone into it much at the expanse of those who've been doing it for years and only care about raiding in this game?- not to mention your nerf's obliterate any reasonable gearing timeline for anything below world 100.<br />

Has Blizzard ever thought of adding some type of alternate advancement system to WoW?

This question concerns the above item. Will we be able to use this in raids? If so, this item could potentially be a HUGE advantage to guilds that have healers with them during progression. Potentially generating 90% of your mana during combat is quite overpowered. I'm concerned that if this item gets in the hands of the right guilds, it will create a very unnatural outcome to competitive progression this coming tier. Furthermore, the following items (while not as OP as the one above) could all make a great impact on a guild's progression:<br />

He's done such things as shaping Azshara in the Horde symbol's likeness, and carving his face in the side of a mountain.. <br />

And yet, he's nowhere to be seen in-game. Not even an NPC! In lieu of Trade Prince Gallywix, at Gallywix's Pleasure Palace, there is some guy named &quot;Trade Prince Donais&quot;.<br />

<br />
I wonder if we'll ever get to play Alterac Valley Old School some time in the future? <br />
Back in Vanilla the matches pretty much went on for a longer period of time where you had to strengthen your <br />
reinforcements, call upon the elementals and escort the gryphon riders in order to bombard the middle. <br />
<br />
This was, in my opinion the most amazing battleground we've ever seen in WoW's time. <br />
I mean, you don't have to remove Alterac Valley as it is now, but if you could add such a battleground in the future<br />
I am sure that many players would appriciate it!</div></div><hr />

When new patches land there is always, from what I've experience, backlash in the form of glitched or bugged older instances.

I personally love re-running older content and with the amount of success with the transmog feature it seems like this is something that is going to continue to be true for other players. Having these bugs so prevalent through all the old content is a bit disconcerting. There are several more, quite a few now in ICC.

It'd be nice to stay relevant through the expansion instead of starting out with a perk and then dropping to toys-n-stuff by the end of the expansion.

The grind was exponentially larger before the changes and actions like the recoloring of the War Bear help the dedicated players who have been helping you grow since Vanilla WoW feel appreciated. Although it was a choice the player made to participate in that grind, it was difficult and time consuming just the same. A title or recolor would demonstrate who spent the months to obtain it when it was difficult, much like &quot;hand of a'dal&quot; title and of course the original Amani War Bear.</div></div><hr />

2. Guild levels used to encourage forming of bigger guilds. Now even the smalles guilds can get to max level in no time. Same with guild reputation. Why this change?<br />
<br />
3. Have you ever considered to add some randomized stats to gear like in Diablo3.

I have played the game off and on since vanilla wow, and classic/BC; it was the only time in which I felt that no matter what point of the game I came into, I could get to see all of the content. I realize that in the past there was a problem of not enough people seeing final tier raid content. However, is it not equally problematic that people who come into an expansion after a certain patch, they simply will not experience any of the prior content. I could always find a guild on a medium/low pop server that was at the content level I desired during the vanilla/BC era. I missed out on Ulduar and TOC in WOTLK because no one did them when I took a break from WoW. I also missed out on the entire first tier of raids from cata, as well as Firelands. Is there a possible solution for people who are like me, just wanting to experience the missed content? When I look back at my WoW career, I realize I never got to finish Sunwell because it was too difficult for my guild to accomplish before Wrath came out; yet, somehow I feel worse about not experiencing Ulduar, or Firelands at all, because they were considered to be some of the best raids in the history of WoW.</div></div><hr />

Most people including myself feel its a lot worse now as it added unnecessary clicks and made it too easy to mistakenly leave the BG when trying to click show scoreboard. Having to wait for a 15 minute debuff to pass because you were attempting to check the stats isn't enjoyable. Is there any chance it can get reverted back to what it was?<br />
<br />
It appears as if only in the beginning of each expansion are there multiple raids of a single tier. Each tier after that there is only one raid. Why is that? Wouldn't it better longevity for your game and raid content if there was more variety later on in an expansion?<br />
<br />
Cross wide zones for many players cause a lot more problems than they solve. A good amount would like nothing to do with them. Would it be possible to make CRZ similar to pvp flagging yourself so if you did not wish to participate in them you could simply turn it off? Adding more competition on herbs, nodes, and rares with no real benefits isn't exactly the idea of a good time for many of us. In fact in severely hurts the appeal of low population servers in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has probably been asked and maybe even answered at some point, but I've been away from the game &amp; forums for quite awhile and I'm just coming back so I'ma ask again. As I'm sure you're well aware Guild Wars 2 has implemented a lot of very great features in their game. From not having to be grouped to get equal xp &amp; loot from mobs if you help kill them to one of the best features, everyone having their own unique crafting nodes so there is no competition to race and steal it from the other player. It makes for a very very nice environment to play in and really promotes enjoying seeing other players on the same quests and encounters as you because they're not going to be stealing it from you, everyone is going to be getting the exact same benefits whether grouped or not. <br />
<br />
Now being World of Warcraft, understandably there's the war aspect between Alliance and Horde, but when you hate to see a member of your own faction appear on your screen because &quot;oh noes they're gonna steal meh node/quest item/mob!&quot; it's just disheartening tbh. So my question is what are the devs views on these features and do you see WoW possibly implementing some of these features in the future?</div></div><hr />

On the common subject of the theramore isle scenario event airing this week before MoP, why did the team not decide to create an actual world event for MoP's release? All other expansions have had a memorable serverwide events, but the approach you have taken on preceding the MoP launch is a bit on the weak side to say the least, and maybe even disappointing for many players who expected something more groundbreaking and exiting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the mage, any time you go afk - sitting down or checking the map or whatever - a handy indicator alerts hordes in the area that you're now (even more) prime for ganking. Then when you start fighting back there's a handy indicator like on airplanes to tell everybody from a great distance which way you're facing based on the color - including a handy indicator of when the mage has finished their cast, such that your interrupt would be wasted. <br />

You can also do scenarios, heroic dungeons, and challenge modes in cross realm groups. Why is cross realm raiding limited to only previous tiers? It seems that you can do anything with friends from other servers but not the highest end game content and it doesn't really make sense. There has been a lot of talk about low pop servers and lack of 25 man raids, well cross realm raids opens up a lot more people to raid with in small servers and also for 25 man raids. The way it is now if you cant find a guild to raid with you are doomed to run LFR and then hope to get invited to a PUG or cross realm raid group after the next patch when you don't have the completion achievement. It just seems like cross realm raiding should be available for every tier which would provide people more opportunity to experience raids in their preferred size during the actual tier at full difficulty.</div></div><hr />

That being said, everything wow does is high fantasy and if anything can be said about what makes the burning crusade different than the rest of wow is the elements that are less high fantasy and more &quot;science fiction&quot;. Ie the space ships, and the lasers pew pew.</div></div><hr />

Raids difficulty is enough, and they are very interesting but unfortunalety, we can not say the same thing about leveling, 5 players dungeons and the outside content. I understand that it is important for Blizzard to satisfy the new players by making them feel powerful from the start but having a leveling without any challenge, without any fear of death and in the end, without any chance to learn how to play a class before going into the first high level dungeon, all those things made the game not attractive for a big part of the initial population. Even for the high level content, we have heroic dungeons and LFR that are considered as the easiest content ever seen in an online game, and we have the raid with a real challenge, but unfortunately a lot of players can't play this mode for different reasons as location (that's my case), time, social life, etc... and those persons are limited to the content without any challenge. Being able to satisfy those persons too was one of the strengh of the original World of Warcraft, so I'll repeat the question : Can people not raiding expect to see the challenge back in World of Warcraft ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand that in every new expansion players want new abilities etc. but with MoP being already the 4th expansion, there's just huge amounts of abilities in the game that you need to bind and use to be the best you can be. On the other hand it's &quot;job well done&quot; for the developers for coming up with good abilities that players want to use, but at the same time it makes the game complicated/difficult to pick up, not to even mention about mastering it. From my personal experience it's just very overwhelming to begin with, to the point of not bothering to do it. The spellbook and action bars are so crowded at max level.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magdalena</div><div class="date">2012-09-19, 09:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Couple of questions from my side:<br />
<br />
*What sort of ideas have you been mulling over when contemplating ways in which to incentivise 25 man raiding for players wishing to continue in this format? Do you think you may end up offering rewards (vanity pets, transmog sets, mounts, titles, etc) that are exclusive to 25 player content?<br />
<br />
*Itemisation has felt boring since ToGC, where heroic modes dropped the same items as normal modes, only with a stat increase. While this format may be here to stay, why did you extend it to the &quot;optional modes&quot; of the Protectors of the Endless encounter? It would be nice to have unique &quot;hardmode only&quot; gear once again!<br />
<br />
*Soloing old content becomes an increasingly popular pastime for players with every new expansion. Since you've nerfed gold droprates from instances so much, could you at least find some way to ensure players have their costs for consumables, repairs, etc, covered when soling? It doesn't feel fair that they aren't even able to make back the money they lose during soloing.<br />
<br />
*Speaking of the gold nerf, it's received some pretty negative feedback from the community. While we understand the need to nerf trash gold, in lieu of AoE looting, why nerf boss gains so much? It's hardly fair to compare the ease and accessibility of a boss such as Flame Leviathan/Magtheridon to the Heroic 25 versions of the Lich King or Yogg Saron. <br />
<br />
*I really like the idea of the Cutting Edge achievements, but dislike that they are not available after the next tier of content is available. Why not enable a form of player &quot;turned on or turned off&quot; gear scaling, which reduces item level and stats to the appropriate ilvl when completing this achievement? That way, it's impossible to outgear (in the same manner as challenge modes), but still doable over a lengthy period of time.<br />
<br />
*Some of us in the Beta feel as though there wasn't enough discussion about the iterative design behind specific classes and specs, despite how awesome overall Blue/Player interaction has been this time round. Would you consider doing in-depth class or spec specific feedback sessions in which we're able to hash out some of the nitty-gritty details we feel merit some discussion? I'm speaking as an Unholy DK here, but I am sure multiple players from different classes feel similarly. <br />
<br />
*Pet/Minion AIs: Are they ever going to be made smarter? It doesn't feel very fair when specs that utilise pets have to suffer because 30% of their DPS is largely out of their hands and unable to respond to their commands (Alysrazor and Madness of Deathwing being good examples).</div></div><hr />

For example, just having to do the grind from Heroics to T14 LFR to T15 LFR would be a lot more fun and lets everybody experience the content, instead of having the system stay how it has been (doing heroics and then jumping into the current tier)?<br />
<br />
And another question: Are you guys going to add more faction specific armor again, like in patch 3.2? But actually design each class's tier set instead of making it similar for the armor types? That was one of the things that disappointed me the most in ToC.<br />
<br />
And another: What are your current plans for the content patches for Mists? Are you going to repeat what you did in Cata and make one of the content patches have no raid? And if so, will they at least have a few new questlines/scenarios/dungeons and have a new daily hub or two?</div></div><hr />

In my opinion the real work of Cataclysm was the revamp off the game not just from a visual perspective but from a coding/developer perspective. This would allow you to add and edit areas in a more timely and cost effective manner. With this in mind my questions are...<br />
<br />
Did this this help create a standard to follow in Mists to allow you to be more efficient both now and in future patches?<br />
<br />
Will this be applied to other areas? <br />
<br />
Was there noticeable differences in both time and iteration with the new methods?<br />
<br />
<br />
...also. There seems to be a long term storyline brewing (about the Burning Legion perhaps...and no pun intended based on the upcoming expansion:)). However it seems the lore is being condensed into quick mediums such as the scenarios, quick paced cut scenes and what seems like rushed raid dialogue. Though I liked Theramore I did find it a little quick. Do you see any difficulties in playing a long storyline but having some players becoming used to quick fire bursts of lore and perhaps not being used to longer arcs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
any chance we can get class roles added to the ingame calendar when accepting events to help with raid organisation?<br />
<br />
in lieu of the uproar over a lack of event for the end of cataclysm/start of MoP, would you consider just letting your GM's abuse their GM powers for a bit of fun on live servers? it's not a scripted event, but it would be something you could actually call an event that wouldn't take a lot in terms of man hours.<br />
<br />
retro raids - can we use a combo of the gear normalisation tech and the new skill scaling by level to add old raids to the LFR queue? - from molten core through to firelands, including original 40 man onyxia, 40 man naxx, zul'gurub and zul'aman, even if they only drop transmog gear and a few gold. understandably the classes have changed significantly through the expansions and older content may be a lot less challenging, but being scaled back to appropriate player/stat levels would certainly entice a lot of players that never got to experience the content the first time round to participate. is something like this ever going to see the light of day?<br />
<br />
can you give us any details about the unlabelled island northwest of pandaria?<br />
<br />
will we ever see a return to the burning remnants of kezan and the undermine? or was the island completely destroyed by deathwing?<br />
<br />
will the goblin racecar from the goblin starting zone ever be available as a mount? possibly a new crafting recipe for engineers?<br />
<br />
am i right in thinking that the cross realm zone tech also works in reverse? so instead of populating underpopulated zones, it can split overpopulated zones into multiple copies of the zone with less overcrowding<br />
<br />
details concerning the proving grounds have been very vague - could you give us a little more clarity on what will happen within them?<br />
<br />
in Tier14, you will need to have cleared mogu'shan vaults before you can progress onto terrace of the endless spring and heart of fear. when Tier15 lands will you need to have completed vaults, terrace and heart of fear to be able to progress? or will blizzard be resetting the progress point and allowing players into Tier15 content without completing the previous tiers? will there be multiple raids in Tier15 or 1 big raid with lots of bosses?<br />

considering the impact challenge modes, scenarios and even dailies should have on farming valor and that LFR should have on acquiring gear - do you feel 5 man heroic dungeons with better loot are still necessary as a catch up mechanic? therefore, will any additional heroic 5 man dungeons in MoP be tuned harder than the launch heroics with better gear rewards and a higher ilvl requirement to enter? or will they be tuned to the same level as the launch heroics with similar ilvl rewards? maybe they could have no gear drops, but instead have higher valor rewards (with which to upgrade other gear) and transmog/mount/pet/gold/crafting recipe drops instead</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Do you have plans to introduce hard mode only bosses. I know you guys gave us challenge modes, and i know you guys dont like to waste resources on things that the majority might not get to see. But algalon was a LOT of fun.<br />
<br />
-There are a lot of stories being told in world of warcraft at one time, way more then the current set up of raids and dungeon progression allows you to tell. Is there any chance you can produce small, non tier (as in they dont give tier sets), 5 mans and raids that may not progress the expansion story directly.. possibly small raids that reset on a shorter CD?<br />
To expand on why i (and a lot of other people) would like this.. We had a raid much like what im requesting in BC, the original ZA, i never came across one player that hated ZA. It was a short raid that reset every 3 days. It was a great time sink for people that were both able to clear all of the content in a few days, or even for those who couldn't. And the major plus is that it wasn't mandatory at all, because it wasn't part of the current tier. Doing raids and 5 mans like this would let you guys revisit stories that take place in old zones or even add to them, and would help get players back out into the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Question1: I have for a long time thought about, if you where ever implementing a Techno Mage class upgrade or Hero class? <br />
<br />
A little sidequestion, in the northen barrens at the top of the mountians there is a giant area with only a few things includeing a few tauren tents a lake, and a few trees, according to lore, the Technomage was haveing there headquarters around the same area, at the boarder between Barrens and Ashenvale, if the class would be implemented would it be possible the same area would be used as there starting area? I could imagen that in the time before such would happens the mountian range would be enclosed in a magical shield like Dalaran pre, wotlk.<br />
<br />
Note: My personal biggest wish for WOW besides player houseing, a carster/tank/healer, based on technolegy like this. Im working out a class describtion how I personally think it could work.<br />
<br />
Question2: With the upgraded character models, will the long waited Tattoo shops and other character details such as jewelry, be implemented aswell? Maybe also includeing recoloring of items?<br />
<br />
Question3: Will we ever be able to wear glasses/Monocle while wearing another hat? I personally wish i could use my monocle while i was wearing another hat.<br />
<br />
Question4: Im a very old WOW player with plenty of unobtainable items such as the direbrew remote, the Scarlet Monestary dog whistle trinket and more, I have for many years wanted to change to Shaman so i could be Healer, but I RP alot and like the rare gear. So i was thinking if you would ever make it possible to either class change or us being able to send soulbound items to our own characters?</div></div><hr />

How do you encourage the good players to keep playing?<br />
<br />
Question 2: Why do you trash all the content so fast in favor of the new one, instead of encouraging the players to farm ALL the content of an expansion? Regarding this issue I would also like to ask you about the way to make the difference between a good and a bad player, by only looking at them, no inspecting no nothing.<br />
<br />
Question 3: Why did you make this design for raiding, better said why do you allow the players to mix their raid difficulties instead of locking them in only ONE raid difficulty and not allowing them to get into another during that week?<br />
<br />
Question 4: Why do all items look alike since Ulduar? And why do they give the same amount of stats? Where is the diversity?<br />

A Major Villain being the the core to an expansion has been a successful tool for the past several years. We understand you want to develop Horde vs. Alliance hatred, but it seems to be a story line that goes no where because neither side can win. We want to play a game to achieve victory and feel supreme! Hence why we enjoy the big bad. Will MoP introduce a core player to the Plot to keep us thirsting for more?<br />
<br />
2. PvE Titles are a way to flaunt your &quot;Stuff&quot;. Can we see such vanity items like the Heroic Mounts/Titles kept to 0% Nerf only? The Nerfs allow &quot;more&quot; players to take part in the harder content, but that shouldn't allow the 35% nerf players to receive all the same rewards. Let them have the gear and the achievements...but Keep the vanity items to the 0%. It will actually keep more raiders motivated to learn the fights on harder difficulties if they first killed it with a 20% nerf for example.<br />
<br />
3. Why did Moonkins lose Earth and Moon? Also...Healthstone are still a unique snowflake buff that are very very powerful. With the recent change to them making them even stronger this expansion, it makes us feel required to pick up a Warlock. Can we see Healthstones brought to the raid by more specs or another Class? (An Idea would be Moonkin Eggs. :) )</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocbd082ac7f0</div><div class="date">2012-09-19, 10:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've just read the already given answers related to 25-men-Raids, and I have to admit, I'm kind of upset.<br />
The first time I heard about the glorious change &quot;All loot will be the same in 25- as well as in 10-man-raids&quot; back at the end of WotLK, my FIRST thought was instantly: This is going to kill A LOT of 25-man-Raids. And guess what? It dit. On my own server (Horde faction) were up to then around 15 to 20 guilds playing 25-men-raids. Today, at the end of cataclysm only ONE is left. And now I hear those answers that are saying &quot; It's something we discuss frequently internally. We don't have anything final to announce just yet, but we love 25-player raiding and intend to do what we can to preserve it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then my questions are: Why did you sabotage it in the first place, if you truely love the 25-player raiding? <br />
Or did you really NOT expect the 25-men-Raids to die out?<br />
And IF you really want to make it worth again to put all this effort it costs in bulding up an maintaining such raids: Why don't you just switch back to the way it was before? <br />
Why does the loot of a 10-man-Raid (which is far easier to handle and quiete often the boss encounter itself is easier in 10-man) needs to be the same like in the 25-man-Raids? <br />
Why can't there be the better loot only in 25-man-Raids or at least a good part of it? <br />
I know that will cause an upcry in all those now so comfortable 10-man-raids, but hey, I still cry about that initially decision to make them the same.<br />
Sorry, if I sounded rude, but I'm really kind of upset about this.</div></div><hr />

Any plans to reduce the amount of clutter from holding onto transmog gear? Perhaps create a function similar to disenchanting that turns each individual armor piece into a digital collected item, much like mounts/achievements/companion pets.<br />

This would allow a drastic amount of space to be freed up on the server end, as well as add more fun when collecting transmog gear.<br />

Like when you have just wiped @ 2% each time on lets say 5%-Nerf &quot;buff&quot; and the next reset its forced to be an 10% buff, so it easy kill-able. Also you cant work your way back up now.</div></div><hr />

Being a 25m raider, i find it tough some times to hear when a boss is about to yell out and do an attack with all the sound effects going on unless i rely on DBM's warning (which is also based on the sound effects volume). Personally i think it would be really nice to be able to turn down the sound effects and have louder voices instead.<br />

<br />
1. Warlock companion question:<br />
<br />
Allthough the new companions look very good. I wonder if there is a possibility that we could get a glyph simular to the Hunter one, to reduce the size of the companion. (or scale too toon/char)<br />
<br />
I play one of the &quot;shorter&quot; races, and I feel out shined with a companion that is 3 times my own size,<br />
I wish there would be more focus on the warlock player than the companion<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Will we ever see a option to turn the weapon enchant on/off?<br />
<br />
The current Power Torrent shines so bright and big that I can´t see my weapon, and it don´t make a big difference to change the ingame settings.<br />
So would be VERY nice to have a option to have it on display or not.<br />
<br />
Kind of like with helm, cloak etc<br />

<br />
Are there plans to add more functionality to mounts as incentive to collect other than their looks?

<br />
Do you like the state of racials, do you think it's fair that horde racials are useful in both pve and pvp and do you plan to redo racials sometime during this expansion or is it something that you are not even considering?</div></div><hr />

Do you think in the future we could see previews being made of encounters, that show the extent and effort that goes into them, art, mechanics, testing. I understand the the production effort that would have to go into it would be quiet high and there would be some things that would need to be kept secret but I think it would provide the playerbase with a lot wider appreciation of the amount of work that goes into each part and when something is broken it isn't just a case of make it work like this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Is it intended that an entire stack of shaman earthshield can be purged with a single purge (especially with the amount of purge abilitys increasing) like it was in tbc and if so, what is the design intent behind this?<br />
2. Is it intended that shamans who spec into Totemic Restoration make macros to cancel their own (SLT/Tremor/Healing Tide) totems to reduce their cooldown, is this considered skilful behavior or unintended use of the mechanic (especially since you do the same as totemic recall except you dont get much mana back &amp; you save a global)<br />
3. Why have there been so many (anti-melee) control tools been added while at the same time making it harder to keep someone active because of the dispel cooldown?<br />
Wasn't it so that you said earlier you want to reduce the arms race between cc and anti-cc?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DoomRyder</div><div class="date">2012-09-19, 10:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Since there are soooo many questions, I'll just select 4: <br />
<br />
1)During events of &quot;The Shattering&quot; both Alliance and Horde had their fair share of liberation action through the world of Azeroth (Gnomeregan for Alliance and Echo Isles for Horde). What really puzzles me is this - when will we see those two racial capitals as their own cities? I know troll village on Echo Ilses needs to expand, but what about Gnomeregan? Will there be a moment in WoW when a player wants to go and see gnome city in its prime?<br />
<br />
2)I started my WoW &quot;career&quot; as Alliance. Be that as it may, Sylvanas really captivated me during Cataclysm (through quests and short leader story). Shall we see her as &quot;reactional&quot; (remember her dialogue with Garrosh in Silverpine forest? and in Gilneas (What kind of question is that?!? OFC we are continuing development of plague!)) as in expansion that is now almost behind us? More importantly - are there chances she will retreat to Northrend and continue her reign as Banshee Queen there? Will she try to dethrone Bolvar so that she does not come in situation in which she runs out of &quot;continues&quot; (read: Val'kyrs needed for her resurrection)?<br />
<br />
3)Out of all races on Alliance, Draenei are simply amazing. Their lore, their way of life... heck, even small role in &quot;Family values&quot; from Warcraft:Legends manga (remember Leena?) is outstanding. Will they go back on Outland (shattered Draenor) or will they move to a new planet? Also, I know this is a longshot and you probably won't answer this question, but will we see Leena (here's link http://www.wowpedia.org/Leena) in expansions to come? Maybe as an member of Earthen ring elders?<br />
<br />
4)It is a fact that Garrosh will use warlocks (even fel orcs) on Pandaria to achieve his goals and total domination over Alliance. Someone from dev team said there is &quot;something sinister going on below Orgrimmar&quot;. Since we've seen Warchief Hothead using proto drakes and magnataurs in Ashenvale, are there chances that there's also a Pit Lord somewhere, ready to make &quot;Blood of Mannoroth 2.0&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Haven´t you never thought about introducing Tol Barad as well as Wintergrasp as regular Battlegrounds, it´s a shame that no one queues to play them when they are up...<br />
<br />
Achievements are allready there so just need to &quot;dungeonice&quot; them, right ?</div></div><hr />

As it is now on my retri I cant get enough haste to avoid getting locked out and have to wait 3sec just to be able to crusader strike again. Is this intentional? <br />
<br />
I think I would like HolyWrath reworked and put back into retri rotation. As it is now the rotation is far to simple. If you know what to push it will never change, sure we got the exorcism procc, but thats all. Having to choose between which spell is the most important was the fun part about retribution, now its just spamming whatever is available and use exorcism when it proccs. if you cant get anymore holy power use templar and refresh inquisition.<br />
<br />
I just really dislike getting moments when i just have to wait for 3sec to be able to attack again. I also think that more haste will just make that 3sec into ~2.5sec waittime or something like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regarding tier sets, some classes have only one set of tier gear, others have multiple sets tailored to each of their specs. Have you ever considered making one set for each class that would have it's stats and bonuses change based off of whatever the players spec is?<br />
<br />
Regarding professions, have you ever considered making gathering professions share similar primary stat bonuses? As it is now, many players are forced to gather on alts because the secondary stat bonuses aren't considered viable for raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I for one enjoyed the Isle of Quel'danas. Something the entire server worked together on to get it completed, with it's own dungeon and it's own raid. In addition with this the constant PvP. Now, the Molten Front in my eyes was a dreadful attempt at re-making this, considering the 'progression' was individually. Are there plans to make something akin to this again, but once more with the whole server to work on? (And on PvP servers preferably with guards that don't two-shot you).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bargio</div><div class="date">2012-09-19, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi everyone, here are my two questions :<br />
<br />
Question one : why are the &quot;100 bg victories&quot; achievements such as &quot;Alterac Valley Veteran&quot; not account wide ? It seems like it does not fit with the &quot;play the toon you want&quot; thing that lead to account wide achievement, eg : I have 76 victories on my druid, I'd like to play my rogue, but I'm stuck with my druid to get the achievement&quot;. <br />
<br />
Question two : GC said that you don't like the idea of sending mail to your alts. Did you ever consider a &quot;bank alt&quot; in which we could put all non-BoP stuff and mats ? This would help us to avoid &quot;Ok, I need 10 X and 5 Y to craft Z... I have to log on druid to send rogue 10 X, the log on warlock to send rogue 5 Y, the log again on rogue to craft Z&quot;<br />

<br />
1. We now have a continent in the north, east, south and west of Azeroth. We have a different dimension for Burning Crusade.<br />
Do you have any ideas about where future expansions will actually go? I don't think you can squeeze in any more continents.<br />
<br />
2. We now have motorbikes, trikes, flying machines and other technological machines around Azeroth. Player useable machines are starting to get a foothold in Azeroth compared to what we had in 'vanilla' WoW. In future expansions, will WoW ever start to become more....industrialised or technologically advanced?</div></div><hr />

1.Seeing Sargeras will be fought at some point. And also seeing the corruption of Medivh, can one have some hopes of Medivh returning to fight against Sargeras? Or at least give some guidance?<br />
2. We all know that Gilneas has rejoined the Alliance ever since the Cataclysm. And based on Jaina's quote of it is time to move Dalaran back to the ground, will we see kingdoms such as Alterac, Stromgarde being rebuilt? <br />
3. The Ashbringer, the weapon that split Frostmourne, and gave peace to countless undead souls. Seeing that the current owner, Tirion Fordring is getting old, are there any plans of rumors about whom will inherit the blade?<br />
4. We've seen in the Forsaken - Arathi Highlands storyline, that the Forsaken inflitatre Stromgarde and steal the mighty weapon, Trol'kalar - Troll Slayer. Is Sylvanas or Galen planning to use it? Or was this just to break the morale of the defenders?<br />
5. Stratholme has been, ever since the Second War, up to now a place of a conflict. Destroyed originally in the 2nd war, rebuilt, purged and corrupted and eventually &quot;reclaimed&quot; by the Argent Crusade. Are there any plans of it? Being rebuilt maybe?<br />
6.I really liked the story of a what if Warcraft Universe, of Aedelas sobering up, and through a lot of work and treachery, ending up to being King Of Lordaeron. Are there any plans to introduce more what-if stories, through novels, or another aspect?<br />
7. What of Prince Aliden Perenolde, his mistress Elysa and his sister Beve Perenolde?<br />

<br />
Are there any plans to make professions more fun. Like Tailoring getting fishing nets to give a instant cast but put a CD on the nets or Engineers getting a translator device or enchanters being able to choose what weapon (or equipment?) color glows appear. It feels the only purpose of tradeskills now is just the enhancements they provide once you out gear the the crafted gear.<br />
<br />
Void Tendrils are acting as a fear even though they are described and appear as roots. Warriors with berserker rage are immune, DKs with lichborne are immune, and any creature that grants fear immunities are immune. Intentional or bug?<br />
<br />
Does the gold nerf to past content seem too extreme? I can't even loot 10g out of MC. Hardly seems worth revisiting old raids once you have the xmog items you need out of zones at the risk of taking a repair bill if it wont break even.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can we hope that in the future you will again design creepy zones and environments like those in vanilla and to some extent Burning Crusade (Shadowmoon Valley was the only one a bit creepy) ? Felwood, Duskwood, Deadwind Pass come to mind. Also I have in mind the quests too, not only the graphics and sound effects. Doing Mor'ladim is a complete different experience then doing Lupus Pupus.<br />
<br />
I feel that over time the zones went more and more eye candy and lost much from the &quot;dangerous&quot; feeling that the old zones had. Zones like Nagrand were nice yet the &quot;Vietnam&quot; feeling from StV is unique. Warcraft story went too much from Orc and Humans to Lupus Pupus. Blackwing Descent was definitely a stept in the right direction, it felt really good.<br />
<br />
So, can we hope that the devs will start to redesign more &quot;serious&quot; zones and get rid a bit of the &quot;pink stuff&quot; ?</div></div><hr />

I envy Destro litting themselves while Fire mages do the old fireball casting.<br />
<br />
Question: Regarding rogues, all three specs feels the same, this is actually a big part of the complaints of the community. They don't have really engaging mechanics or even visuals to distinguish from each other. Any plans to address this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lore:<br />
We've been shown precious little concerning the Death Knights and more importantly their integration into their respective factions. We know that Kolitara and Thassarian had become leaders, but what of the others? Are people afraid of them? Are they respected? Or are they hated for what they are? I'm especially curious of these answers in respect to Night Elves, since it seems that most players believe that Night Elves flat out revile the Death Knights.<br />
<br />
Gameplay, Rogue:<br />
EDIT: Scratch my question, I'm seconding Yhvh's Rogue question:<br />

<br />
Why isn't there any optional quest in the Jade Forest main questline (started with &quot;The Mission&quot;) that we actually can skip? There were at least a dozen of optional quests in the main questline in Mount Hyjal back in the Cataclysm. Optional quests come so handy to skip when a quest area is overwhelmed - and it is likely to be happen on launch night.</div></div><hr />

With 1hands clashing together and through the character model's head/back, it looks a tad goofy, and with 2h models, the pole on staves and polearms that stick up a few feet, we look like a good conductor in a lightning storm, looks even goofier.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stollas</div><div class="date">2012-09-19, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a question, With the introduction of CRZ (cross realm zones) in patch 5.0.4 will that make it so the realms that are joined will have to share the new quest areas together? And if so why would you not introduce it a couple weeks after MOP launch so we can level without 1000+ people doing the same quests as us in a new zone.</div></div><hr />
