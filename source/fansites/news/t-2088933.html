Blue Tweets<br />
Will you do anything about vengeance DHs in RBGs, its impossible to keep up with all their jumps, seems mandatory to have one<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What makes Blizzard content starves its community during the long time between expansions and not just in WoW but in Starcraft 2, Diablo 3, and Hearthstone<br />
The Blizzard quality bar is really, really high. We would cancel features that were fairly far along in production because they didn't hit the appropriate polish level. We'd refuse to ship to a date (clearly!) when we didn't think the content was ready. As a player, I understand it really sucks. But it's also hard to argue that the Blizzard focus on quality hasn't worked for them over the long haul.<br />
<br />
(And, no, you can't speed up that time by throwing more people at the problem - mythical man month and all that. Often the barrier was just being able to find enough qualified people on this one planet.) (Source (http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answers/140877160843))<br />

It's fun with a small group but if you're more into raids and stuff then WoW is the only true MMO for that.<br />
<br />
The story telling is amazing and ruined the wow cinematic for me, I skip everything story related in wow because after playing the SWTOR story nothing else compares. WoW is still the better game overall though, just don't ask me who thrall is or what makes him famous cuz I have no fucking clue. :)</div></div><hr />

Its latest expansion was a fresh breath of air to the game. I'd say that it's worth playing, if only for that story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yup if nothing else SWTOR has some great storytelling to it, Bioware has not dropped the ball on that, the F2P system however is like EA's wet dream, basically punishing players that don't spend money or subscribe to the game rather than giving them incentive to do so</div></div><hr />

<br />
i don't really see the enemies being cartoonish. some had pretty complex motivations. emperor vitiate's motivation was, honestly, one of the coolest things i've ever heard of and made me want to be able to do something like what he wanted.<br />
<br />
zakuul is pretty ok, but i'd much rather they go back to republic vs. empire. but with the new expansion, we're dealing with a real psychopath. you can see her backstory in this trailer and if you talk to the woman in the trailer, you can get some of it as well. vaylin's a character that, even if offered the chance to redeem her, even after seeing how bad things went for her, they have made me dislike her to the point that i'm just going to kill her on almost every character i have.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, with so many of them they should be on a rotation. Having it randomly pick with their shitty RNG(see pet for the US yet again) is just silly at this point.</div></div><hr />

I don't have a problem with Jim; I have a problem with repetition. I also have a problem with it not being the ettin because he drops one of my BiS trinkets lol<br />
<br />
This. Just because Jim drops a bis for a few people doesn't mean he does for everyone. He isn't part of the achi either so why not rotate?<br />

Do you have to go through the NPC talking, orb clicking thing every week? Sounds like it takes 2 hrs or so?</div></div><hr />

What does that have to do with world bosses? And no, once you're attuned you get the WQ every other week.</div></div><hr />

It's fun with a small group but if you're more into raids and stuff then WoW is the only true MMO for that.<br />
<br />
The story telling is amazing and ruined the wow cinematic for me, I skip everything story related in wow because after playing the SWTOR story nothing else compares. WoW is still the better game overall though, just don't ask me who thrall is or what makes him famous cuz I have no fucking clue. :)<br />
<br />
this is exactly how i feel about both games. <br />
<br />
That said i have quit Swtor to play Legion, and enjoying it!<br />

In honesty paying for 1 month Sub and getting preferred status afterwards makes it a pretty solid experience. $15 for a good amount of content is not that much, especially since you can pay the $15 right now and play through the entire 16 chapters within that month easily.<br />
<br />
I have quite a large amount of Cartel Coins and generally will just hand out authorizations (the things that unlock premium things for F2P players) to anyone I know that wants to try it out and even that alone can make F2P run smoothly.</div></div><hr />

EA and Activision is what is wrong the the whole gaming scene in general and it's why i will never touch a EA game again. SWToR is all about the fucking Cartel Market and selling shit to the sheep, you pay $15 a month for what? For all the good items to end up on the Cartel Market, fuck that.</div></div><hr />

If you look at the achievements for your artifact weapon called, &quot;Unleashed Monstrosities&quot; you have to kill 8 world bosses to unlock the skin. So far we did Nithogg and Levantus. Withered Jim has been on for two weeks because they sneakily removed him removed from that list thinking no one will know. worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/20307794/unleashed-monstrosities-a-look-at-world-bosses. I got credit for him last week on the achievement. They are gating the players from unlocking this achievement. This not the only weekly world quest artifact weapon that is being gated. The other is the &quot;This side Up&quot; Achievement done through archaeology in which also the spirit of ech'ero mount quest is also being gated. Since the games release 3 quests were repeated every other week. The first was the the crystaline eye of undravius, followed by the starlight beacon and for the last 2 weeks in a row was the spear of rethu. This is unacceptable and they need to fix this right away. <br />
<br />
They need to put 2 world bosses per week enough of this nonsense they can't fix this problem right now. They can hotfixed PVP. That they fix. They removed the number of PVP world quests you can do per day and when they did, a week later before it was announced the sneakily and intentionally reduced the honor you got from those 4 quests in half so instead of 300 you got 150. To force you to do Ashran. Fix your game....</div></div><hr />
