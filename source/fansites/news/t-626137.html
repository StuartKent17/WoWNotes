[EU] New Chamber of Aspects PvE realm<br />
Free migrations to Chamber of Aspects have been closed for this time. Any future migrations will be handled along with other free migrations. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/6848456286-1411-new-migration-pve-realm.html))<br />

Stun mechanics<br />
In some situations, stuns can feel really overpowered and players on the receiving end of them can feel really helpless.<br />
<br />
So, we could treat stuns a lot more like we do other forms of CC.<br />
<br />
However, we have built a few specs around their stuns (rogues obviously, but Ret and other specs benefit from it too). These would need to be buffed significantly to compensate. For example, a rogue who can't stun as often or as for long would need a lot of defenses to compensate. Currently, preventing an opponent from attacking is one of their strongest defenses.<br />
<br />
We totally understand the contingent of players who think excessive stuns just aren't fun. We did back off on several of the proc-a-stun mechanics in the game already. It is something we're talking about. Obviously I don't an announcement of incoming changes or I would have made them already. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/13392159795-can-we-get-a-real-response-on-stunlock.html))<br />
<br />
Blizzard &quot;Balance&quot; team<br />
There is no &quot;balance team.&quot; WoW has a systems design team composed of game designers. Some of these designers have many years of industry experience while others were recruited because of their expert theorycrafting or in-game skill (and often both). The systems design team is responsible for everything from combat mechanic, achievement, and UI design to tradeskill, class and item design. It is one of the strongest design teams in the entire industry, which I feel like I can say, because several of us have been around in this industry for some time.<br />
<br />
In addition to the kind of tests we can do at our desk, we also rely on a large and experienced QA team to find bugs and test implementation. We also have a terrific community team that helps to funnel us information from these and other forums. We also have a lot of contacts among expert players and theorycrafters, in both PvP and cutting-edge raiding, out there who serve as a reality check for what we do internally. We talk to players all the time, through email, through the game, or through forums. All of these are pieces of the process and I would be hard-pressed to say which is the most valuable or has the most influence.<br />
<br />
All told, it is a very robust process and I think that WoW is so fun and has such a large and dedicated audience speaks for itself. I won't claim that we never make mistakes. Sometimes players go in a different direction than we predicted. Sometimes they find powerful combinatorial effects that we didn't know existed. Sometimes they just play better than we anticipated. Sometimes they use exploits. WoW is a very large game with a very large community. Stuff is just going to come up. It happens in any kind of game, and especially in an MMO.

Denyin' the Scion (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2148) too hard for tanks and healers?<br />
While this may be a little extra challenging for tanks and healers, if you are pushing to complete some of the hardest achievements in the game, it doesn't seem very hard to coordinate and make this happen.

Hunter nerfs<br />
This isn't a Ret paladin issue and it's not really a PR issue.<br />
<br />
When we make changes, we prefer to make enough changes to actually fix the problem so we can move on. There are a lot of different aspects of the game we want to touch so we'd rather not still be dealing with hunter dps imabalance months from now.<br />
<br />
I admit when we make mistakes in our numbers. But you shouldn't turn that into our numbers never being close to the mark. Lack of perfection does not translate into a total mess.<br />
<br />
Another reason we like the Steady Shot change is it puts more emphasis on the instant and other hunter shots. Steady is a good bread and butter ability but it's not much more interesting than auto shot. We'd like to see Aimed Shot, Multi Shot, Arcane Shot and other abilities be what the player focuses on. When you get such a big chunk of damage from auto + steady, it makes those other attacks feel puny and the fact you have to use them feel annoying.

Upcoming Hunter changes main post<br />
We also had to delete many and ban many posters who couldn't figure out the proper kind of response for these threads. It is sad that I have to mention it, but since the bannings aren't public I feel the need to warn everyone to consider what you are about to do before you push that Post button. If your reponse gets deleted, nobody is going to read it anyway. If you get banned, you are just going to lose the opportunity to ever comment on changes.<br />
<br />
You are welcome to disagree with us, and many people have. But you all are smart enough to know the difference between intelligent discussion and pointless QQ. That also goes for any of the people banned for coming into gloat or flame the hunters. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=13275172587&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=63#1245))<br />

&quot;The Immortal&quot; World and US First<br />
I know we saw a lot of US/World First news during the last weeks, but I got a lot of mails in the past days about guilds completing The Immortal (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2186) achievement and figured it was worth newsing now that we've got a World First and an US First for this one. <br />
<br />
Congratulations to Such a Thing (http://www.suchathing.de/news.php) (EU - Gul'dan) for the world first.<br />
Congratulations to V A N Q U I S H (http://www.vqguild.net/) (US - Cho'gall) for the US First. <br />
You can also check WoWProgress (http://www.wowprogress.com/achievement/2186) to track this achievement.<br />

<br />
They have the absolutely worst team to ever try to balance an MMO in the history of man. They are clueless and retarded, there are no other words to describe it. Really.<br />
<br />
With all their tools and expert theory crafting skills, they need PTRs, to see how their changes really do in the real world. And even this is not enough. After a few days on the live servers, they have to turn everything completely around again. Yes, very competent really.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheColtrain</div><div class="date">2008-12-11, 12:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do not know if I have been following everything that has happened, but... correct me if I am wrong... Warriors lost their big stun from Maces. <br />
<br />
As it stands, rogues keep me in a death lock (usually casue the little buggers travel in 2's)<br />
Pallys stun me and then do some crazy burst damage<br />
DK's Grab me and then stun me, and by the time I have realised whats going on im dead (yes I am getting older)<br />
Mages freeze me, and then freeze me again?<br />
Druids... well they just seam to run around and Wrath, then run away, have a cup of tea, and do it again<br />
Hunters have their pets bite me in the bum while the hop around (why do hunters always hop?)<br />
Shammys have totems, good for them<br />
Priests have T6<br />
<br />
I am not really complaining though, its all about knowing your class. Point of writing all that was just to show you how much fun it is to get all those ppl around you at the same time, hit SS + Ret + Bez + BS and watch them all hit the ground because I am immune to all types of CC for 5 sec. Ahhh I love being a Warrior.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vermis</div><div class="date">2008-12-11, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi to all<br />
Yess warriors are simple and this is awesome i remember when wow came they shined It was some sort of honor to play one, than rogues and locks come to be popular... but game still was pretty balanced and doing pvp on 60lvl was great fun. But now what we see patch, patch, nerfing, changes. And the ban people coz some of them are ff tired of their &quot;balancing the game&quot;. <br />
Really as guys earlier said, rogues with less stun power would be also good, they have plenty tricks but no, they wouldn't hurt they favourite class, as some one said on BG you can do shit when rogue, paladin or mage put fire on you at same time, maybe skilled player would live through this, but still...<br />
Lastly the dmg in PVE by hunters is too big, come on, I saw dps chart from killing Patchwerk and there are also mages and locks in the same range, so also why don't we nerf them? But PVE isn't PVP there must be also balance but come on cutting dps of mage or hunter will lower all raid dps and than there can be problems heh.<br />
Ok no more qq but as Wisher I ROFL and pity this balance team with ghostclawrer on top or whatever<br />
Why don't they concentrate on finishing some professions for example or bugs in game.<br />
Nvm, we at the end can do shit about this, they will do whatever they want :] <br />
