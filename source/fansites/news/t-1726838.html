With a little more effort and with the help of group finder, you can jump in normal runs which aren't really hard. Normal difficulty is not that hard.</div></div><hr />

The reason Personal Loot isn't being used is that no one wants their gearing experience to &quot;even out&quot; over the course of a month.

<br />
I disagree. You know what's awesome? Killing a boss, right clicking him and maybe picking up my item with no strings attached, just for me. Maybe throwing a bonus roll at it if I really want it.<br />
<br />
You know what really sucks? Seeing an item I finally want drop (in the same amount of runs as the above scenario, pretty much) and /rolling a 12, while another player in my class that died 20% into the fight or barely did damage wins the roll and walks off with something he doesn't deserve. Or a PuG raid leader deciding his guildmate gets the loot, just 'cause. <br />
<br />
Some people don't prefer that kind of scenario. There are arguments for both sides.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just as toxic as the community then, very disappointed and evidence of how out of touch these guys are.<br />

Prevent changing loot type during the encounter? Nope.<br />
Use an anonymous voting system when trying to change to master loot? Nope.<br />

<br />
I don't think they have actually released the algorithms (if they have I'd love to see them), so if they say the math is identical I don't see how Master Looter provides anything other than a false sense of control; everything being equal.<br />
<br />
I'm going to make numbers up here, but it is more the idea I am trying to impart based on the statement that the &quot;math is identical&quot;. If you don't believe that, that's fine I'm not here to decide whether or not one favors conspiracies or improve trust issues one might -- justifiably -- have. This also ignores the skewing that abusing the Master Looter system can have.<br />
<br />
Constants:<br />
One drop per five loot-eligible raid members.<br />
Loot may only be assigned to class/spec appropriate users.<br />
<br />
Assume a group of 15 loot eligible.<br />
And for the sake of this example we'll target healers and use spirit gear.<br />
Assume a group of 3 loot eligible healers.<br />
<br />
At the highest level, there are two systems that need to be built here. What is dropped? and Who is it assigned to?<br />
<br />
What is dropped<br />
If the math is the same, the high level, simplistic algorithm or base business rule applied is: 15 / 5 = 3 drops.<br />
<br />
You then may have a sub algorithm that calculates what type of pieces drop based on the group composition, but regardless this principle doesn't need to be fleshed out and the algorithm for the AMOUNT of pieces that drop applies to both Personal and ML.<br />
<br />
A spirit trinket drops.<br />
Who is it assigned to<br />
The difference between Personal and ML here is where I think the false sense of control comes in.<br />
<br />
If the math is the same, the high level, simplistic algorithm or base business rule applied is: Eligible members generate values and the highest value wins.<br />
<br />
In Personal Loot, the computer rolls the dice and in Master Looter you roll the dice.<br />
<br />
Now, does the algorithm account for people that already have the trinket and wouldn't roll in Master Looter? Maybe not, but at the highest level and taking as truth &quot;the math is the same&quot;, any loot-eligible members will have the exact same chances in Personal Loot or ML and your tangible benefits of each are:<br />
<br />
PL -&gt; No loot abuse.<br />
ML -&gt; Chances improve when loot-eligible members generate loot, but don't roll on it.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
I think the statement they make about how it feels is very telling. I would guess that if they find a way to mimic the rolling process or feeling of control one has in ML (maybe even an Opt-Out option like Need/Greed/Pass to help account for those not wanting a drop but contributing to it dropping) they will do away with ML in everything except Mythic or 90% Guild runs -- where gear allocation needs finer control -- because they like Personal Loot better as a system.<br />
<br />
Yes, the one drop vs many drop dichotomy exists and is assumed to be balanced over time by the Personal Loot algorithm so you certainly have a point about chasing carrots, but I think the bigger stigma is that the math behind the systems isn't equal and I'd say that is the larger deterrence to Personal Loot adoption. It is true getting fully geared in one go is a great feeling, but a bunch of people don't expect that to happen and would be okay with gearing up over the course of a month. Especially those not necessarily looking to progress outside of their current difficulty.<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that any groups that are not 90-95% Guild Groups or Mythic Groups should be mandated to use Personal Loot because the only reason that justifies using Master Looter in any form of PUG group is selfish in nature -- stealing drops for friends or fully gearing yourself in one go -- and that leads to loot abuse.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ejpaints</div><div class="date">2015-02-27, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only thing ML does is allow for control over who gets the loot. For a guild group that's generally how people prefer it to work. But, for pug situations that's only good if you're one of the people benefitting. I've seen plenty of people get passed over simply because the master looted gave the item to their buddy. <br />
<br />
If I'm running with my guild it's master loot all the way. But, if I join a pug group that's a different story. I don't don't trust someone I don't know to be honest with it bc let's get real, people in this very thread have done the same kinda crap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What exactly does this mean? What did they change that I missed? <br />
<br />
We run with a raid of 12 people and BRF seems very unforgiving. When we add a few pugs and get up to 17+ it seems the fights are cake.<br />

<br />
Yes but you are in a group with four other people. Did you do MoP heroics during SoO? I was in groups with elemental shamans who queued as healers because they could zerg everything down so fast and had such strong offheals that there was no dedicated healer needed and they would also be tanking everything. On top of that such a group would make massive pulls, as in pull all trash mobs up to the boss and do it ala challenge mode world record style.<br />
<br />
Yes I thought that was fun on one side because it was pretty ridiculous and you were extremely powerful just by yourself. On the other hand it ruined those dungeons completely.<br />
I can also understand that anyone who was new and wanted to enjoy the content wouldn't find this fun at all. They would not be able to keep up and would basically not be doing anything at all really.<br />
<br />
At the moment I am already making huge pulls with my ilvl 638 blood DK and tanks or hybrid tank/dps with raid gear, ilvl 670ish, are already soloing heroics. So next tier these dungeons will be a big joke once again if these players that overgear it with 50-70 ilvls use LFG to obtain currency for gear or upgrades.</div></div><hr />

They said the same thing after Dragon Soul. And Icecrown. <br />

The only time they did more than apologize after the fact that a patch took too long was in BC when they added Sunwell so there wasn't 10 months of Black Temple (even then for most people it was probably 2 years of Kara).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fayenoor</div><div class="date">2015-02-27, 11:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd suggest that any groups that are not 90-95% Guild Groups or Mythic Groups should be mandated to use Personal Loot because the only reason that justifies using Master Looter in any form of PUG group is selfish in nature -- stealing drops for friends or fully gearing yourself in one go -- and that leads to loot abuse.<br />
<br />
If you don't assume blatant &quot;loot abuse&quot; as a necessary part of the Master Loot system, in every way, Master Loot &gt; Personal Loot and more so as the Tier progresses further in and gear slots start filling up with loot. <br />
<br />
E.g. Person A only needs say a shoulder and a leg from a raid run. Person B only needs a ring and a neck. With Master Looter, odds of both A and B completing their set is higher than with personal loot -- the reason like you pointed out is loot eligibility vs loot need. With personal Loot, A can keep getting the same ring (which B needs) over and over again every run and B can keep getting the shoulder than A needs. Both are dissatisfied. With Master Looter, the ML can assign the ring to the right person and the shoulder to the right person. So, ML always win in a purely fair system. <br />
<br />
<br />
Master Looter corruption (like any form of corruption) taints the system. This is why OpenRaid is so much better than WoW Group finder for Pugging content. Systems like OpenRaid run raids with Master Looter using Raid Leaders who have a very strong history of fairness (else they will be taken apart in their feedback). <br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, one possible way of making Personal Loot more lucrative is to allow an &quot;opt out of loot&quot; option. I.e. boss X drops nothing of interest for me. I can choose to &quot;opt out of loot&quot; on Boss X but still help with the kill. This way th Personal Loot system won't roll the dice and give an item which I don't need.</div></div><hr />

You can run heroic dungeons repeatedly to quickly gear up. Raid Finder is a way for players to experience the content and story, as well as earning some meaningful upgrades. If Raid Finder gave worse loot than Heroic dungeons, participation would be lower, players would only run it a few times, and queue times would go up.<br />
<br />
So dungeons will never be a progression path again, like TBC and WotLK because of LFR...Is this how your next expansions will roll as well? This is your casual content? Run LFR once a week and pay us the sub? pf... and I was confident about WoD..Back to FFXIV I guess</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Heroic dungeons are another area that could use some improvement. They aren't very useful right now in terms of gearing up. Valor or badges were a reason to run dungeons in the past, but they weren't a great way to do it. You would run a dungeon that you were far too strong for, which isn't fun. Challenge modes have a niche as challenging content for gear progression. You can't queue for them randomly and can only do one a day, but it is something.<br />
A Mythic version of dungeons is something that has been talked about internally, but nothing to announce right now. It would be nice for dungeons to remain relevant later in the expansion. Would increased numbers and item levels be enough, or would the dungeon need new mechanics to really be Mythic?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the first thing on the front page. I do agree with you that LFR shouldn't render HC dungeons completely useless for casual players and alts, and although that's pretty much the situation now, I'm hoping they can fix it going forward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I completely agree with you about the idea of loot eligibility vs loot need, but I think what I was kind of driving at was the idea to dissuade stalwart belief that Personal Loot is empirically a bad system. By taking &quot;math is the same&quot; as the basis for comparison, it would stand that they could have some kind of algorithm to help with this and that maybe we shouldn't just hate Personal Loot because it /feels/ unjust or different. Doubt in the 'infallible' Master Looter system is all I am trying to cast, because I think just as it is healthy to be skeptical of Personal Loot's secretive algorithms, I think it is fair to be optimistic they could have good methods in place as well.<br />
<br />
I'd love to see a pre-raid, battleground exclusion type system in place to augment the Personal Loot system. Maybe that is too complex, but ultimately a way that loot-eligibility still counts, but loot distribution calculations are adjusted. They could even include a visible representation of the computer rolls as well. Click a button and it mimics a /roll command even though the actual processing has already happened in the background. To me, the bonus roll experience greatly exceeds that of the Master Looter and I'd love to see them blend it into the core Personal Loot experience as well.</div></div><hr />

They weren't a progression path, it was purely used as catch-up. So was the dungeons in Cata and the Timeless Isle in MoP.<br />
<br />
Anyone who was raiding at the time couldn't find a use for any of the loot in those late-stage dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What exactly does this mean? What did they change that I missed? <br />
<br />
We run with a raid of 12 people and BRF seems very unforgiving. When we add a few pugs and get up to 17+ it seems the fights are cake.<br />
<br />
I spoke to an old friend and his guild is feeling the same way.<br />
<br />
Is this just us? Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
its most probably due to how healing work atm - you feel it much more in smaller groups cause u have less healers to ease up dmg - adding extra healer make most of those fights really easy - for example if u run with 12-14 people run with 4 healers no 3 - encounters will take a bit longer but dmg income will be smoother. its boring but effective.</div></div><hr />

I don't really see that anyone learned anything, other than their washing their hands of Method cheating to get World First. Oh, and a new pony, for cash. <br />
<br />
Now, for the hilarious part - and Blizzard should fucking know better by now:<br />
<br />
Mythic Dungeons will be expected now, and every patch, there will be howls and screaming if they're not included.<br />
<br />
Timewalkers are now expected, same result. <br />
<br />
They've just guaranteed butthurt, if they're not included in the following patches.<br />
<br />
Seriously, do they never learn? <br />
<br />
And, nobody will pay attention to the personal loot comments. That meme is being spread to cover up for the people who are abusing ML. Period. <br />
<br />
And, finally - make up your fucking mind what LFR is. Either it's meaningless content to just see it, or it's part of the progression. Why does it have to have &quot;meaningful&quot; rewards, when it's dumbed down so hard right now that the fights are meaningless? Make up your fucking mind! Give LFR a definition, and stick to it!<br />
<br />
This whole expansion is just one big lack of vision of what the game is, and how it's played. It's like they throw darts at the wall to decide what to &quot;fix&quot; next, and by &quot;fix&quot;, I mean destroy. This Q&amp;A does not strike me as a team who has a clear vision of how it all works, that's it's all part of a shared vision and goals, and they're confident in it. It's all wishy washy cop outs and dithering and tweaking endlessly. You know why dungeons are pointless and no fun and need improvement? YOU DESIGNED THEM THAT WAY. That's all on YOU, devs! You had no idea, even though people were shouting at you in beta over it, that the lack of valor or meaningful rewards after a week or two would be a problem? Seriously? It's your game! You purposely made it like it is now, you made all of the decisions to release those dungeons in their current state, and NOW you're concerned over it? The only way that could happen is if they were designed and put into the final build and released with no oversight or review by YOU!<br />
<br />
Seriously. Someone needs to sit these guys down and put the fear of the pink slip in them. These are not professionals, this is amateur hour. They've been doing this for over 14 years now, including the dev time before vanilla. They should be a well-oiled machine now for pumping out good, solid, reliable content on a regular basis, setting up dungeons should be easy by now. What the FUCK is wrong in Irvine?</div></div><hr />

Agreed with this. The majority of my friends playing this game are enjoying with dungeons in the past, where we can group together, chit chat and still got reward like badges to upgrade our gears. Thus, the community is still alive.<br />
Compared to the situation right now, where most of them just stay inside the garrison for couple minutes and log off, most of them already retired too. Mainly because the game itself becomes really boring right now. Why the developers don't realize this?</div></div><hr />

When they first said they were removing badges I thought if they're making a change this drastic it must mean they're replacing it something great and came up with a cool new way to make dungeons useful to players.

You want something more, yet you don't really wanna work for it... perhaps put in the time to do Normal Raids, deal with the groups that take it little more serious and get personal loot. You should value the idea of earning what you deserve. If I'm doing mythic difficulty, you damn right know that I deserve some Mythic loot, especially since I've worked hard for it.

You can do CMs dialies (don't need to win medal, just complete the dungeon) to get better loot than LFR. You do have progression with dungeons.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping they further improve on it in the future tho. Maybe a weekly CM quest to get a bronze or silver medal, that awards Normal to Heroic raid gear (with proper itemization).<br />

<br />
Actually, from SoO statistics, LFR numbers were only bolstered because people who ran higher difficulties also completed LFR for gear or on alts. The data points towards the ammount of people that only raid LFR being inferior to the ammount of people that raids Normal or harder. The inclusion of Group Finder in WoD, and the changes to LFR rewards, will probably only increase the numbers for Normal and Harder.<br />

<br />
Yeap, it's about percentages. If you go with 10 people, 20% will be tanks, another 20% or 30% will be healers. If ONE person dies, you lose 10% of your raid. And most mechanics are fixed numbers and not really scaleable, so on smaller groups you also have a higher percentage of people handling specific mechanics.<br />
<br />
The only advantage of a smaller group, mechanically wise, is there are fewer people to screw up/not know what to do. Like stepping on Imperator mines =P</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why this is the case. The whole point of mythic difficulty was so they could design encounters with 20 player / all class rosters in mind. So starting with a flexible difficulty mode as the base just seems weird to me. It's not really any different than designing an encounter for 10 man and then making it &quot;harder and different&quot; for 25 man other than a difference in scale. To me it would seem like the better approach would be to design Mythic encounters and then scale back mechanics to fit heroic/normal and flexible raids. Otherwise Mythic really is just a glorified &quot;25 man&quot; heroic mode.</div></div><hr />
