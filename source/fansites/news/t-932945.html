Firelands Raid Boss Pages Update / LearnToRaid.com<br />
While we're discussing Firelands Raid Bosses, I would like to point out that most of the Firelands raid boss pages have been updated with new videos from LearnToRaid.com (http://learntoraid.com/). <br />

PvP Season 10 Begins<br />
PvP Season 10 has officially begun, and players can once again take to the Arenas and Rated Battlegrounds to compete for the new Ruthless Gladiator PvP sets!<br />
<br />
All Team Ratings and Personal Ratings have been reset, and any Conquest Points from Season 9 have been converted to Honor Points. Any Honor Points above the cap were converted into gold at a rate of 35 silver per point. Matchmaking Ratings, however, will be carried over into Season 10.<br />
<br />
Another important event that coincides with the start of Season 10 is the distribution of rewards from the previous season. Players who were in the top teams from each battlegroup at the end of season 9 should be receiving their end-of-season rewards approximately one week after the end of the last season. These include Arena-specific titles until the end of this new season and, for players who have earned the rank of gladiator, the Vicious Gladiator’s Twilight Drake. It's very important for players who feel that they may be eligible for Arena titles and/or the Vicious Gladiator’s Twilight Drake to refrain from transferring their characters to another realm or faction until all rewards have been received.<br />
<br />
If you have any further questions about Arena and Rated Battleground rewards, please read the FAQ.<br />
<br />
- Season 10 Gear List and FAQ (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/184245/pvp-season-10-begins)<br />
<br />
This season introduces most of the gear I already posted on Patch 4.2 patch day (see below) and a new boss in Baradin Hold, Occu'thar (Wowpedia) (http://www.wowpedia.org/Occu%27thar). <br />
<br />
The strategy is pretty simple - One main tank, one off-tank, Occu'thar is tanked facing away from the raid and the off-tank taunts and starts tanking the boss whenever the current tank gets a stack of Searing Shadows (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96913). Healers keep everyone alive, and DPS make sure Eyes of Occu'thar die under 10 seconds while DPS'ing the boss as well, that's pretty much it. <br />
Occu'thar<br />
This ravenous demon broke free of its cage and gained access to the western wing of the prison, devouring all of the inmates held there. Occu'thar's gluttony resulted in a body too bloated to escape its environs, effectively turning the prison wing into its new holding cell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Focused Fire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96884) - Occu'thar sets his gaze on the location of a random player, then inflicts 35000 Fire damage every 1 sec. to players within 12 yards of the targeted location.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/tank.png&quot; /&gt; Searing Shadows (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96913) - Occu'thar inflicts 105000 Shadow damage to players in a 60 degree cone in front of him, and increases Shadow damage taken by 100% for 30 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eyes of Occu'thar<br />
Occu'thar forms an Eye of Occu'thar on every player for 10 sec. The eyes bore into their target hosts with the Gaze of Occu'thar.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/deadly.png&quot; /&gt; Gaze of Occu'thar ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96942/gaze-of-occuthar/') - The Eye of Occu'thar gazes at its target host, inflicting 6000 Shadow damage every 1 sec. for 10 sec.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://urbad.net/tmp/icons/deadly.png&quot; /&gt; Occu'thar's Destruction ('http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/96968/occuthars-destruction/') - After an Eye of Occu'thar remains attached to a player for 10 sec, it fully bores into the host and detonates with Occu'thar's Destruction, inflicting 25000 Shadow damage on all players.<br />

Stats balance on gear<br />
Stat balance on gear should be looked at via much more than just boss loot tables. We consider reputation gear, tailor gear, Valor gear and the tier sets when examining what's available to you. If you wish, you can have Spirit on every slot but your belt (which can still be reforged). The priest tier set has Spirit on all 5 slots.<br />
<br />
Having said that, the mindset that only cloth with spirit is priest healer gear (and cloth with no spirit is never priest healer gear) is a mindset to be resisted. If that is allowed to set in, then all the fun of looking at a potential new piece of gear and deciding for yourself whether it is an upgrade for you is removed entirely.<br />
<br />
Along those lines, something to keep in mind is that there is more to improving the healing you do in cloth than simply stacking spirit. As you increase spell power, haste, and crit, and your tank increases health, armor and avoidance, boss damage negates less of your mana in the first place. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/184258/cloth-gear-had-the-spirit-burnt-off-in-fl) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2743809738?page=2#39))<br />

Arena Season 10 Start and new gear<br />
You are correct. The season transition and introduction of new PvP items was different this time around, and we apologize for the lack of advanced warning.<br />
<br />
The Season 9 set was removed today. The items available for purchase with Honor Points are now considered lower tier Season 10 items. They are still the same items from Season 9 in terms of aesthetics, but the item level and stats are slightly higher to ensure that the Season 10 honor gear has the correct item level relative to the Season 10 conquest gear.<br />
<br />
It's likely this is how things will work going forward and we'll be sure to make that more clear when the next season transition takes place.<br />
<br />
New basic transition flow:<br />
<br />
1) Season X ends and rated play is unavailable; Season X gear becomes available for purchase with HP; CP is wiped.<br />
2) One week later Season Y starts and rated play is available; Season X gear is removed entirely; Season Y introduces a low tier of items which replace Season X vendor items and are available for HP; Season Y introduces the new top items available for CP and rated play.

Lava Bolt Crossbow (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71558/lava-bolt-crossbow/) / Lava Bolt Crossbow (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71366/lava-bolt-crossbow/) sounds like a gun<br />
This is a known issue for which we have a fix. The crossbow shouldn't sound like a gun. 'Cause that'd be silly.<br />
<br />
Updating sound files requires a client-side patch, so unfortunately this cannot be addressed via a hotfix. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/184307/lava-bolt-crossbow) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2743730471?page=1#10))<br />

Because it resets haven't happened in EU yet. If a guild like Paragon goes in there and downs them too, then it will be a tie. When both regions have the content then World Firsts will begin.</div></div><hr />

I think this patch is a disaster. Yeah, the content is great ... but not enough to last for another 6-7 months.<br />
Patches will come every 3-4 months now according to blizzards new &quot;schematic&quot; on content patches, probablly feeling the preassure from RIFT which has had alot of content added since they released and IMO blizzard can pump alot more content than they currently do.<br />
<br />
Also world firsts goes to whoever kills X boss after the realms are up after reset this week.<br />
Meaning if Vodka killed Alysrazor 6hrs after realms went up and Paragon kills 4hrs after their realm is up then Paragon were the first, atleast in my eyes.</div></div><hr />

I don´t understand why it is so hard to understand. A lot of time, mana regen is not the limiting problem. If anything, the change to crit (100%) healing should have opened your eyes.<br />

Why are you calling it &quot;US first&quot; and not &quot;World first&quot; ? id imagine because the EU havent had ago at it yet. so its not really a world first kill because its not a fair contest if US gets to have a go first. eu wud have won if it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yea, first three bosses took 2 days (2 on the first day), Eredar Twins took 3 days (gates opened 8th, first kill 10th), M'uru took a bit longer, 5 days, same with Kil'jaeden. So two last bosses were even close to a week, so stop exagerating...</div></div><hr />

Agreed, even though most of them live and breath raiding, they are real people... raiding at 5-6 am is not the same as 4-5 pm. <br />
<br />
I really hope that after all the regions go live, Blizzard comes out with a list showing the time the servers came up to when each boss was killed. I can't imagine they don't have that capability to get that information. I think that if Paragon takes down Shannox 30 minutes faster (based on when the servers became active), a guild like Premonition will fully accept and congratulate them under that premise. I would expect these other like guilds would also fall into that and accept it.</div></div><hr />

However i doubt any guild has had the chance to test Rag on heroic just 6/7 H. Still Paragon will be one of them guilds who have defiantly had the chance to test at least 6/7 H and should not be counted in the race. People seam to forget blizzard doesn't want its content to be cleared fast they want a &quot;balance&quot; They don't want the game to see to easy (yes i know these hard-core guilds basicly have no life and its a 9-5 job but the average dumb ass who plays doesn't see it like that). They see it has &quot;hey look contents been cleared in 1 week must be a lol fest FL is easy&quot; , they will more than likely never kill more than 5/7 N themselves. Blizzard does not recognize the World / First only Realm Firsts for a reason.. World first is something made up by the Warcraft community. It has no real relevance at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because EU don't have 25H modes yet... World First is determined by the guild who downs each boss in the quickest time when it becomes available to them<br />
<br />
e.g. - A 25H Raid is released on US Realms at 12pm, and it takes lets say 5 hours for a US Guild to fully clear it (from the first to the last boss)... but if the same 25H raid is then released on EU Realms the next day, and it only takes an EU guild to clear it in 4 hours, the EU guild gets world first, because they did it faster... make sense?<br />
<br />
Can't call it a world first, because EU don't have the FL Raid yet (well they might do now...I only just got up lol) :)<br />
<br />
and also according to both of Blood Legions and Premonition's sites, they seem to have downed Alysrazor now too :)</div></div><hr />

To me the assertion &quot;We need to get new Content out faster&quot; sounds just like another crude rumor.<br />
<br />
Definitely not a rumor. I'm too lazy to sniff out where they officially stated it, but they said this around the time they announced their drop in subscribers and sometime before 4.1 came out. In fact, I'm almost certain it was on an MMO-Champ update.</div></div><hr />

1/7, not 3/7.<br />
<br />
With more time than others (took a while for Blizz to turn off heroic modes) for trying heroic bosses and the way they did. Yes, ppl can laugh at them for that. <br />
<br />

<br />
I am student and I have much more time (Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering in Czech Republic...) and If I have summer job i have a lot more time for play. I usually (i have to:) work in my dads firm, we are instaling (??) floors every day for 8-10 hours. And I still have more ten 3 hours.<br />
<br />
So dont tell me working ppl dont have time... They do, but they want do diferent things. Same as me I will rather do diferent things then play WoW.<br />
<br />
Everything is about priorities!! <br />
<br />
But I dont want force Blizzard to make WoW easier in principles, and more accessible for player like me. In TBC or Vanilla everything was much harder to obtain and ppl play it. Why blizz si changing this model?<br />
<br />
Now you can only make new alts, thats all. But nowadays you hit 85 and after 3 days you can into raid. You can cancel your subscription for 6 months and after 3 days from resub, you can jump into current raid. IMO this is wrong. Where is the feeling you earn something? Where can you see you are better then other? Btw. are you happy, if you get some new purple? I think no.. Its normal, it isnt special anymore. etc. etc. etc. etc.....<br />
<br />

It's still an exploit. If Blizzard had to react to the kill with a hotfix, it is an exploit. Period.<br />

Pretty much. No shame in calling out cheating losers for being cheating losers.<br />

<br />
Also world firsts goes to whoever kills X boss after the realms are up after reset this week.<br />
Meaning if Vodka killed Alysrazor 6hrs after realms went up and Paragon kills 4hrs after their realm is up then Paragon were the first, atleast in my eyes.<br />
<br />
I wish people would stop using this to defend or justify blizzard's slow release of content. The remark you are referring to was a repetition of a promise made at last years blizzcon for faster content patches....which blizzard miserably failed to meet with the delay in 4.1 and the pushing of firelands to 4.2 which itself was delayed...<br />
<br />
they simply can't push out the content as fast as they hoped for a variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
and if you honestly believe we'll be getting significant content patches every 3 or 4 months I have some swampland in florida I would like to sell you</div></div><hr />

I totally agree with this. Regardless of what STARS did to get a hold of the content faster they still downed the boss without any exploiting and did it before anybody in the world. The only thing that has changed is people stopped caring who kills new bosses first in the world. Just way too many variables to generalize competition in that way.</div></div><hr />

Pretty irritating.<br />
<br />
This one kind of bugs me too - it doesn't make much sense. If the old gear was too low level, buff it and raise ilvl. It was TOTALLY undocumented or people would have sat on their honour points (at least 4k's worth) till today/tomorrow. The existing gear (365) should be buffed to keep things reasonable.</div></div><hr />
