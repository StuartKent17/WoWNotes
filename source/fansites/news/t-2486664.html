In Patch 8.2, players will be able to complete a quest chain to obtain Gnome Heritage Armor (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8473-Patch-8-2-PTR-Gnome-Heritage-Armor-Quest-Chain) and Tauren Heritage Armor (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8496-Patch-8-2-PTR-Tauren-Heritage-Armor-Quest-Chain-Ask-Mr-Robot-Class-Guides).<br />
Rise up and stand tall with two new Heritage Armor sets—one for gnomes and one for tauren—coming in the Rise of Azshara content update.<br />
<br />
Players with maximum-level (120) gnomes or tauren* who are Exalted with their faction (Gnomeregan or Thunder Bluff respectively) will be able to embark on a new quest line for each race to learn more about their history. Once you complete your quest, you’ll gain a new Heritage Armor transmogrification set unique to your race and be able to show off your pride.<br />
<br />
*Tauren will also first need to complete the War Campaign quest Stay of Execution, which will be available shortly after the launch of Rise of Azshara.<br />

Stand proud as you reconnect with your ancestors through a spirit journey to honor your tauren heritage.<br />

I think aslong as its 120 and exalted its fine. The lvling thing was only with the allied races not core races</div></div><hr />

<br />
I only brought it up because they kept saying &quot;you just have to be exalted and do the quest chain!&quot; before this, repeatedly. I don't even have a Tauren, nor will I be trying to get their armor any time soon.</div></div><hr />

The whole point is that there tied into the story and story wise bane is kinda important to the cows.</div></div><hr />

Cairne is more important. :p Baine is just a lower quality replacement.</div></div><hr />

While true Bane is impotent to Cairne so it makes sense we’d need him.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather his rescue him more than him be in charge. He was Corki before Corki existed!</div></div><hr />

It is to confirm what happens first in the story.<br />

So i will have to grind honorbound rep once again on my new tauren? sheesh...<br />

<br />
They get a huge focus in 8.2 with Mechagon so makes sense to give them the armor now if you ask me. I don't play one though, but I do play tauren.</div></div><hr />
