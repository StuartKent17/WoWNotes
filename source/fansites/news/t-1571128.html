Yeah, it's not like Blizzards cinematic department isn't known for being one of the absolute best in the business or anything.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This team works on all of the cinematic at Blizzard. If they aren't working on multiple at a time (which a single one takes well over a year to finish), they start working on the next one immediately after. These guys have been specifically paid to produce these for years.</div></div><hr />

Because the Grom in the artwork is a cartoon, which is what WoWs art style is based off of. Blizzards cinematics have always tried to add a look of realism to their franchises.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dude... really? That's how Orcs look. That's how they've almost always been portrayed, unless I guess you to the darker reaches of ERP and maybe even then. <br />
<br />
Orcs are basically pig men. I thought everybody knew this? Here, allow me: <br />
<br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orc<br />
<br />
(Emphasis mine)<br />
<br />
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia <br />
<br />
For J. R. R. Tolkien-specific use, see Orc (Middle-earth). For other uses, see Orc (disambiguation).<br />
<br />
Our present-day conception of an orc or ork /ɔrk/ or /ɔːk/ is one of a race of mythical humanoid creatures, generally described as brutish, aggressive and repulsive, stemming from the writings of J. R. R. Tolkien, where orcs contrast with the benevolent Elvish race. The orcs are a race similar to the goblins. Tolkien developed his idea of the orc from the Old English term orcneas.<br />
<br />
In popular culture (including fantasy fiction and fantasy games), orcs are variously portrayed. Facial features tend toward the grotesque (generally a mixture of the ape-like and pig-like), and their skin typically a shade of green, gray, black, brown, or sometimes red. They may be physically stronger or weaker than humans, but almost always starkly different. They often ride boars, wolves, and wargs, and other unusual beasts.<br />
<br />
<br />
So yeah, ape/pig men.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Snes</div><div class="date">2014-08-12, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What makes you think that?<br />
Because they are ONLY credited for their work in the cinematics section of WoW's credits? Sorry to dismantle your unfounded cynicism with fact-based arguments, but:<br />

They are orcs, they aren't supposed to look handsome really. Honestly I am uncertain of how I think of a clip from a video until I see the vid. I might like it, I might hate it but really having seen the way they've designed Varian Wrynn I'd say orcs aren't the only ones who have claim to the unflattering look. No judgement on your opinion, just my own observation.</div></div><hr />

Grom looks awful to be honest.<br />
He looks like a fat,sad Orc with a double chin who grabbed his weapon for the first time in his life.<br />

THIS is Grom,not that crap.<br />

Except I didn't say 'aged' - 'aged' has many positive connotations. I said 'dated', and they simply are - in the same way that the vast majority of older CGI is, and in the exact same way that the original WoW character models are. The cinematics show their age - you can see the technological limitations present in every aspect of them, and most notably in the overly-simplified plasticky character modeling and rendering.<br />

You can argue that those flaws are aesthetically pleasing to you, but really they're just visual evidence of a technology-driven lack of ability to produce a final product that resembles a hand-drawn character design. It's not a jab at Blizzard's cinematics team, it's just acknowledging that they weren't able to create a cinematic back then that would be up to today's standards of animation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Nose thing that everyone is up in arms about, is likely from the angle the camera is at in the Cinematic. We're looking up at him from a lower angle, so obviously his nose is going to be more prominent/upturned like that. Wait to see the whole thing, and then judge. His in-game model looks fine, and that's the one we'll be seeing the most.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bisso</div><div class="date">2014-08-12, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He looks... weird. Why couldn't they stick with the way the orc looked on the Warcraft 3 Mannoroth vs Thrall and hellscream cinematic / mop human vs orc cinematic?<br />
<br />
Well, cinematic characters in WoW rarely look like their ingame counterparts, except maybe Lich King (and only in WoW, not Warcraft 3). Also, the difference between Grom's Warcraft 3 cinematic and WoD cinematic could be explained in alot of ways: <br />
<br />
First, the obvious one, the quality and fidelity of CGI have greatly improved with time, which might indicate that if it would have been possible to put that amount of detail on Grom back in Wc3, they would have done a similar look.<br />
<br />
Second, art direction changes with time. The cinematic team can't just go back to a old style Orc from Wc3 cinematic when they have slowly evolved their art style from a cinematic to another for the past 10 years, they had to stick closely to MoP orc model.<br />
<br />
third, the Grom we will see in WoD isn't the same Grom we see in Wc3. The green Wc3 grom who beats Mannoroth is about (20?, correct me for exact numbers) years older. That surely has to have an effect on ones face/bulk/overall look. His skin is still brown, so uncorrupted, he also doesn't look like he has drink Mannoroth's blood either. So all these could have an effect on his physique, to a point to making him look 20 years later, after alot of events, like his Wc3 counterpart.</div></div><hr />

Wow, what an obnoxious reply. It's pretty standard for the cinematic models to look different from artwork, and that's the case here as well. You could assume I'm also an idiot who can't see in perspective, or you could you just look at the image and turn it around in your head and see that his brow is more forward, nose is broader, and upper jaw is shorter. Better yet, just wait for the cinematic and you'll see.</div></div><hr />

Hype... They managed to create a crowd mentality and create hype where they might not of been any.<br />
Exactly, minus the bad grammar.</div></div><hr />

Honestly if his eyes were open more it would look 10x better. My only problem is he looks really sad and mopey.</div></div><hr />

Still, I don't find the redesign to be bad, so I am not going to dwell on them changing things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The MoP one was incredibly good, so well made, just that it lacked that incredible hype-feel to it like all the others.</div></div><hr />

Orcs are based from pigs the same way Taurens relate to cows.<br />

Think you need to read up on the lore mister. Draenor is the Orc's homeworld. The Draenei's homeworld is called Argus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No shit? This cinematic is of the orcs climb to the mountain where guldan summons Mannoroth for them to drink his blood. If there were any Draenei shown id be pissed since they simply weren't there. Also, Grom looks awesome and detailed IMO. It's mostly the angle that gives him the piggy look btw.</div></div><hr />

By the 18-month timeline they imposed upon themselves, we should be seeing the cinematic for the first major patch hyped, not the cinematic for the expansion itself. We should by now all be familiar with the world, the story line, the characters that they are just now getting around to teasing us with in this cinematic. And yet they have the audacity to pretend like there's any actual hype for this? Their sub numbers should be a clue that the legions of fans that once held their collective breath for The Next Big Thing have lost patience. Forget the teaser to the cinematic, then the cinematic, then the teaser to the game, then the release countdown, then finally the game - how about we just skip ahead to the game before it goes the way of Titan.</div></div><hr />

Stop making moronic claims. Over 6 million subs is nothing short of a miracle after 10 years.</div></div><hr />
