Thanks, forgot to clarify which ones specifically. I had edited it in when creating the post, but for some reason publishing the change didn't work the first time &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

The toys give the opposite faction's, I got both from Farseer Ori, as do the mounts, but I haven't been able to confirm the pets yet, so not sure if they give parity.</div></div><hr />

Which, like me, you could chose to ignore...not do...etc...<br />

Three bodyguards to 30 is just insane....not happening - especially not in a zone like this.</div></div><hr />

Yep. It requires from you to log every day, but you can't call it a grind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not even that. Some quests are obviously more grindy than others, which is why I always check on alts which quests are available for which bodyguard, and then on main choose accordingly, the one which will take the shortest amount of time on that particular day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it does if you do them casually. <br />
What's that? you want the useless prestige mount and cosmetic essence to be available after a week? You don't want to have something to work towards?<br />
<br />
You expect everything instantly and then cry when there is nothing left to do. It's people like you that are bad for the game.</div></div><hr />

The issue with the cosmetic reward is it will be useless in 9.0 so why bother farming a cosmetic reward you can only use for the next year? Give us cosmetic rewards we can use after the heart of azeroth is gone in 9.0.</div></div><hr />

That's a lot of emotion and assumptions there bud, are you okay? <br />
<br />
Having something to work towards is nice, that's kind of the point of the meta achievement though. There's plenty to do in order to get the crab even if it was all available to complete right away. Besides that you also are assuming that people who complain there's not much to do are not already feeling this way. Nazjatar and Mechagon appear to be jam-packed at first glance. There are a lot of things to do in a day... but there are not a lot of different things to do. <br />
<br />
I'm exalted with Unshackled. I do my follower quests and a few world quests, that takes maybe 15-20 minutes at most. Then I spend at least 50% of my time waiting for a rare to spawn in Mechagon and Nazjatar. Even when I turn war-mode on, there's hardly ever any Alliance around so it's not like I can do some world PvP while I camp the rares. The few I do encounter run always flee to the nearest camp whenever I engage them. I always end up joining a rare hunting group, go semi-afk until either the rare I need spawns or a supply crate drops. <br />
<br />
That's... honestly that's not very fun gameplay right now. I already feel like I have nothing to do because everything I want to do is gated behind a timer.</div></div><hr />
