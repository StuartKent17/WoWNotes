Removing prereq talents<br />
Designing as a player typically means trying to change the game's design in ways that make your character more powerful. &quot;Hmm. I have to get talent X in order to get talent Y. But I don't want to get talent X, because then I couldn't get these other talents I want. Therefore, Blizzard should change the talent tree so I can get Y without X.&quot; I would say something like 95% of the posts in the role forums are from players wishing their character was more powerful, or other players arguing against those sentiments. I wasn't saying anything about whether designers or players are better people. Just consider your forum suggestions as to whether they would benefit the entire game or if you're really just making them to better your dude.<br />
<br />
Players wanting to remove the prereqs is almost always because they want the bottom thing but don't want to also have to get the top thing. In essence, the talent tree design is cramping their style and not letting them just cherry pick whatever talents they want. But that isn't the intent of talent trees. The intent is that you make some choices, and sometimes that means having to spend extra points to get a talent you really want. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560847583/again-with-the-arrows-thing-please-take-heed/))<br />
<br />
[...] You can take the cynical point of view that every time a player complains about a talent prereq then the prereq is actually accomplishing something. If they don't complain about it, it's probably because it isn't really affecting their decision -- perhaps they would have gotten both talents anyway.<br />
<br />
Yes, sometimes talent A is needed for B (because B affects A), but to be honest, we face the same issue when we want to talent an ability that you get at higher level, and what we do in that case is just bundle the talent with something else. It isn't strictly necessary to link the two with a prereq arrow in those cases.<br />
<br />
Some of you are sounding defensive, but it wasn't my intention to insult anyone here. I was just trying to challenge you to think about *why* those arrows are there. They aren't random or arbitrary. If they are forcing you to think about things differently, then they are doing their jobs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560847583/again-with-the-arrows-thing-please-take-heed/))<br />

Volley removed from the game (And of course when I don't report a missing skill because I think it's a bug, it's actually gone for real) <br />
It's gone. We want to make Multi-Shot the spell hunters use for AE.<br />
<br />
Channeling a spell that makes arrows fall out of the sky doesn't feel like a hunter ability and doesn't even really match the name of the spell. <br />
<br />
Only class with a minimal range and now without volley only class without an aoe /shakes head<br />
You realize &quot;only class&quot; claims are viewed as a success by the developers. The classes are too similar as it is. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560868356/volley/))<br />
<br />
Most seem to think they simply removed it &amp; that we will be using multishot instead.<br />
Yep. Volley was edging out Mult-Shot, even though we think the latter is the more interesting ability. Volley felt too much like a magic spell and not something a hunter was doing with her bow or gun. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560538335/what-s-going-on-with-volley-shot/))<br />

Holy Paladin Talents<br />
We do think the Holy paladin tree has a few too many mainstream (meaning as apposed to situational) healing-focused talents. The next build or so should have a tree with more freedom. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560567075/holy-paladin-build-12803-feedback/))<br />
<br />
Eye for an Eye<br />
Eye for an Eye will only reflect direct damage spells, not dots. [...] We want the talent (Eye for an Eye) to be situational or at least subjective and not a no-brainer. As an active ability, every paladin would feel compelled to take it, which then gives you fewer points to spend elsewhere. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br />
<br />
Optional Talents<br />
Talents like Eye for an Eye, Selfless Healer and Acts of Sacrifice are designed to be choices. No half-decent paladin is going to skip over a major talent like Sanctified Wrath. But we are trying to design the trees so not every talent is Sanctified Wrath. If part of what attracted you to the paladin class was being able to occasionally throw out a heal to save your friends in a 5-player dungeon, then Selfless Healer might be attractive. If you like having lots of utility in PvP, then Acts of Sacrifice might be a better choice.<br />
<br />
It's okay -- intended even -- that some of you would skip over these talents. It's only a problem if everyone does so. We imagine a cookie cutter Ret build would tell you to absolutely take Sanctified Wrath and Zealotry, but to spend a few points where you want. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br />
<br />
Templar's Verdict with one Holy Power<br />
This would be a pretty big dps loss under most circumstances. A 3 charge Templar's Verdict hits so much stronger than a 1 charge, that it's not worth it using Templar's Verdict to fill holes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br />
<br />
Holy Power generation and skills rotation<br />
It seems to me you are saying there are these abilities that sometimes grant you a charge of Holy Power, but that in order to get Holy Power as fast as possible you need to get lucky several times, so therefore the abilities should just always give you Holy Power.<br />
<br />
The rotation is designed around 3 Crusader Strikes. Sometimes it takes fewer than that and you get to use Templar's Verdict sooner. You're not balanced around a maximum efficiency that is dependent on the stars randomly aligning. You're balanced around average efficiency that corresponds to the averages generated by the appropriate random numbers.<br />
<br />
I think there is some tension between Exorcism potentially generating Holy Power such that you're not sure what to do when you have 3 charges -- use the Templar's Verdict and potentially waste the Exorcism Holy Power, or use the Exorcism and delay the next Templar's Verdict -- but that seems like an isolated problem (and perhaps not even a major one) and not a reason to make Holy Power generation more consistent. Consistency is what we're trying to downplay in the Ret rotation because it doesn't allow great players to outperform merely good ones. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435297657/paladin-exorcism-and-art-of-war/))<br />
<br />
Using every GCD<br />
This specific feedback is a tricky thing to handle because a lot of Ret paladins are used to mashing buttons every GCD, and any time they aren't in that state they are going to feel a lack of &quot;rhythm&quot; (as you put it). Yet if you look at rogues and Feral druids, they can't hit a button every GCD because they don't always have the energy to do so.<br />
<br />
We don't want classes / specs to use every GCD. We don't think that's good for the game, as I've mentioned before. (Casters do their waiting while casting rather than in between abilities.) The trick is to fill &quot;enough&quot; holes with something. For some players, especially some Ret players, that &quot;enough&quot; is going to feel weird for them unless it means every single hole. That's not what we're going for though. Wasting every other GCD is too extreme and isn't what we're going for either. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br />
<br />
Words of Glory<br />
I usually reget getting into the &quot;what is my role supposed to be?&quot; discussions because players then feel like they're supposed to use that as a constitution to interpret whether their class is performing correctly or not. Let us worry about that. If Word of Glory is so weak that you'd never consider using it, then that's good feedback. If it needs to heal for 50K before you'd ever consider using it, then that's good feedback too (because it either means we're barking up the wrong tree, or you personally aren't the correct audience for that talent). The fact that you have talents that affect a heal should be ample evidence that we want you to situationally cast it. The fact that you have only a couple of talents (and one really aimed at Holy sub-speccing) should suggest that we want to keep it situational. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br />
<br />
Hammer of Wrath<br />
Hammer of Wrath hits too hard to be a rotational ability. We'd have to make the proc really rare or nerf the Hammer of Wrath damage. You might notice we dropped Execute from the Arms warrior rotation for the same reason -- it actually neutered Execute rather than making it a fun ability. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br />
<br />
Retribution mana usage<br />
Ret is designed to be able to hit basic abilities with enough mana. You don't have infinite mana. You'll find that casting heals other than WoG will be really difficult and Consecrate is probably not going to happen unless you situationally find yourself with a lot of mana. In that environment, being able to do something other than dps might be attractive. I think it gets way overplayed on the forums, but it's often nice to offer something other than &quot;I bring damage!&quot; to a group, because everyone brings damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560848132/ret-primary-problems-with-build-12803/))<br />
<br />
Seals<br />
We're going to add a little bit of damage to Justice just because there are several talents that improve Seals in the trees and we don't want those to be completely unattractive to a PvP Retribution paladin. I think it's far too early however to be able to place judgement [sic] calls on whether damage or the movement limitation of Justice is the obvious choice. You can't do much damage if you can't get to melee and typically autoattack-based damage isn't nearly as valuable in PvP.

Restorative Totems<br />
Restorative Totems isn't long for the world. It's a poster child for the kind of talent we're trying to prune. We just haven't finalized a suitable replacement yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560567610/restoration-shaman-concerns/))<br />

Telluric Currents<br />
We want Telluric Currents to be optional. It won't be an effective way to restore your mana, but it might make you feel less guilty about throwing out a Lightning Bolt in a world where mana is more precious. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560567610/restoration-shaman-concerns/))<br />

Following that logic, Blizzard needs to remove Arcane Shot. Volley is a spell only because of game mechanics. Don't you think a hunter can be good enough to just crazy-shoot a bunch of arrows for a short amount of time?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If guns are the problem, why not remove guns ? I can imagine a hunter with a bow and arrow shooting arrows skyward to have them fall down in a volley on a pack. If the same can't be said for a hunter with a gun, maybe it's time to kill guns and stay with bows and crossbows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes i can imagine, i can't imagine those arrows falling from the sky tho, what you describe should be seen as the ''Strafe'' ability from the Amazon in Diablo 2. (Fire rapidly a large amount of arrows on nearby enemys). Wich would be a lot more logical and fun, than just channeling our own version of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Either that or buff Multi-Shot to something similar to the Diablo 2 Amazon's Multi-Shot, mechanic-wsie, that would be simply a wider and spammable Cone of Cold, but that would fit a lot better. And be funnier than : Go in melee -&gt; Explosive Trap -&gt; Disengage -&gt; Channel Volley.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And they give me reasons to continue mine. Really not fan of the current incarnation of the hunter, with Focus replacing Mana, Camouflage and now the removal of Volley, Hunter might start feeling like real Archers.<br />
<br />
First people don't even think even realise yet, but ''AoE down every single trash pack'' is gone in Cataclysm, they will be harder, and require CC and most AoEs are getting nerfed, so volley might not even be that usefull.<br />
<br />
Second, they will give hunters something to make up for the loss, GC SAID they were working on Multi-Shot, just wait a few beta builds before claiming that the sky is falling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brilliant. Blizzard actually tries to explain their decisions, but ofc the players insist on responses like &quot;Gief back volley&quot;. No arguments, no discussion, just a demand.<br />
<br />
Being a game designer, making informed decisions, explaining them to the community and being just met with nerdrage.....doesn't sound rewarding at all.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it makes ignoring this kind of &quot;input&quot; all the more easier for them I guess....<br />

While CC was never big in Wrath, when people in i200 and below first were in heroics were weren't AOEing it all down. I found that more prevalent after many had passed through Naxx. Now we have tanks would take three or four trash packs at once in heroics without real threat to their life.

I won't even miss it, AEing constantly is stupid. Let them locks and mages do their job. Multi shot becomes much like Cleave now, i believe. I'm pretty sure they even hold some shiny, currently secret plans for improving it to state of perfection (two of them are in mm and sv trees already), much like said warriors have now and, still, they never complain.

If you read through the interface patch notes you'll notice that it hasn't been for years. It's only recently that they've started to flat out reimplement popular addons (quest helper, equipment sets, power auras). The game has been out for a long time and these addons are both mature and well known to the player base, so there is no real need for Blizzard to reimplement them from that perspective.<br />
<br />
If you look through the tech support forums you'll notice that in a large number of cases the blue posters are blaming addons. It would be ridiculous to assume that they're not actively trying to get rid of the tech support costs associated with 3rd party addons - replicating the popular addons and ultimately getting rid of the whole API would achieve this.</div></div><hr />

The day Blizzard closes off their UI for modification is the day that they finally decide they don't like all the free work they get out of the addon community--not going to happen. Right now they have a whole host of people working on ways to make the UI better, and Blizzard doesn't even have to pay them. If something becomes as ubiquitous as Power Auras (or God forbid, GearScore), it makes sense for Blizzard to incorporate the addon into the baseline UI. Anyway, it's not going to happen...like, ever. That'd be too much like something Apple would do (/shudder).</div></div><hr />

It's to make the game more newbie friendly. You shouldn't HAVE to install addons to be able to play the game like its meant to be played. They will never remove the possibility for addons creators to make addons for the game. Why would they? They always come up with great, free, ideas that contributy to the game they've made. If you want the customization that PowerAura gives, you will still have to use PowerAura.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When Bliz implemented the quest help function on the zone map, I was VERY happy to uninstall the QuestHelper addon, which at that point became unnecessary. Now they are trying to replace Powerauras as well as Grid/Healbot (from what I've seen of the new unit frames in Beta). The less addons we need to have installed, the more reliably the game will run. I know people that have more than 30 different addons installed and the amount of times they have to /reloadui because some addon bugged is impressive. <br />
<br />
However, I doubt Bliz will remove the addon framework. For them it is a perfect &quot;canvas&quot; for 3rd party developers to try out new ideas, which they can then adapt into the game (or &quot;steal&quot; if you want).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, volley is one of those changes that sounds like the end of the world at first, but when you think about it, it's most probably a good thing. More CC less aoe spam, multi-shot will be buffed/changed and volley was boring looked silly (hundreds of arrows just randomly falling from the sky) so i think this is a good change.<br />

The Power Auras icons looks neat! It's great that blizzard is interigating addons, for all the newbies to see and use. They are handy indeed!<br />
<br />
I support their reason for removing Volley, i have never liked that spell for hunters. I have never supported mana for hunters either, the changes they are doing to the class (Focus, Volley removal) makes them look more like a real 'hunter' or 'archer'. <br />
Now how will they change Multishot? hmm.<br />
<br />

Durr hurr AoE is the only way to do damage. Don't you get it? Gone are the days of AoEing everything. This will mostly hurt those hunters who did nothing BUT Volley. Perhaps AoE farmers to a lesser extent, but hey, tough. Instead you'll get a better Multi-Shot, a skill that, in my opinion, is far more interesting than just DURR HURR ARROW RAIN. Hell, before Wrath Volley was sitting on a one minute cooldown. It has never been the main part of a hunter rotation, EVER.<br />
<br />
Beta is beta, stuff changes. Quit your whining and learn a proper single-target rotation. You know, like every other DPS class out there. Oh, but I guess that would make you actually decent and not a unique little scrubby snowflake you desire to be. Tough.</div></div><hr />

You cant compare Volley pre-wotlk to today, unless they take AoE from rogues and say spriests and some of the hybrids too its pretty unfair. Also you said that hunters are cc/support/dps class, are they doing CC or support others on trash that just gets pulled and AoEd down? I didnt think so... Trash that needs CC usually has some killing order too, you wouldnt use Volley there anyway. All they are doing is giving another class/spec (ele shamans) regular AoE spam spell with Earthquake or so I read somewhere. And taking it from hunters... GG blizz, really.</div></div><hr />

So, every class should get the same set of skills, just with other names? I think that would be pretty boring.<br />
And to trash: Blizzard said they gonna put CC back in the game with Cataclysm. Were do you need CC? Mostly when you are fighting trash, right.<br />

Loving the new power aura type things. This further proves I am not crazy in thinking that Blizzard is trying to phase out third party addons from the game. Gearscore..go please. lolz.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Volley being removed from the game. I play a hunter as well as some other classes. And I really am not as worried about this as some seem to be. Simply put, I have not played my hunter for a long time ( around 6 months ) because the playstyle was becoming stale, and I needed a fresh injection to the class. This is it.<br />
<br />
With focus changes, Volley removal, Pet scaling, Hunter trees looking pretty darn near better than they were in the past. It is a good time to start playing/replaying the hunter class when cataclysm launches.<br />
<br />
It will be a whole diffrent learning curve, new players, old players will have to learn and figure out. And to me that attracts me more than what hunters playstyle is right now on live servers.<br />
<br />
I for one look forward to it, a class should be challenging to play, not overally challenging, but it should be a case where you need to be aware of what you have left, where you are, and which shots to use. <br />
<br />
Hunters have become more complex.... Hunters have become more fun....Hunter have become even more epic.</div></div><hr />

I hope, more or less, that Cataclysm needs more CC and less AoE.<br />
That they are removing the AoE from the hunter makes me hopeful.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopeful? They removed Volley and killed Multi-Shot damage by making each shot do 50% damage. We won't have any AoE to speak of now except traps. On a related note, they removed Silencing Shot's 50% damage as well.<br />
<br />
- Volley gone<br />
- Silencing Shot damage removed<br />
- Multi-Shot does 50% damage<br />
<br />
At least they removed the stupid damage boost to Camo. That was such a stupid idea. It would have forced hunters to macro that ability into to our opening attack for each pull.<br />
<br />
Personally, I would like to see all CC removed. Its gotten so bad and overpowered over the years. Yeah, AoE bombing is boring, but constant CC'ing was very frustrating and time consuming in Classic.<br />
<br />
Why not change Volley to behave like the vrykul archers in ICC?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's hoping they give hunters a new multi target spell which is some kind of a proc. Or even a buffed multi-shot will do. That would make it much more useful in boss fights with 2-3 targets. Because atm, Hunters suck in multi-target boss fights, like Anub, Freya, LDW, Mr. BOOOONNEEEESTOOOOORRRRRRRMMMMM, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is Multi-Shot going to be improving radically for all three specs somehow, or are Hunters just supposed to not care because AoE is no longer the driving force behind the DPS game?</div></div><hr />

Volley was mind-numbingly easy but so are many other abilities that are staying in-game for other classes. Rain of Fire, DnD, Consecrate, Whirlolwind, FoK, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />

It was more useful in pvp than pve. As GC has said many times, not all abilities were meant for pve.<br />

It will have to be redesigned to make up for the other losses.<br />
<br />
My concern was better voiced by the hunter that brought up Volley missing and GC responded to; He left the group because all he had was single target dps to contribute to the dungeon group. I remember rogues being left out of groups in Classic, because they were single target specialists. I fully remember having a very hard time getting groups in Classic because hunters only have one CC, Freezing Trap, which everyone always broke anyway. Years later, we have Silencing Shot along with Freezing Trap. Not much has changed for our CC and now we are losing our AoE. These changes could lead to hunters getting ostracized again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is your caps lock key stuck? <br />
<br />
I personally don't agree that players would rather skip LK entirely because it isn't new. Theres a huge difference between seeing something on youtube and experiencing it first hand. <br />
<br />
I saw plenty of videos of top end guilds storming through Ulduar but that never took away the the thrill of fighting through those bosses or the sense of satisfaction, when we got firefighter and yogg+1 down. ToC was completely out long before we cleared Ulduar and was the &quot;new content&quot; and yet we chose to clear Ulduar before even stepping into it.<br />
<br />
Do keep in mind these people haven't seen LK where you have had nearly 2 years of it. They are gonna be just as excited for LK as the rest of us are for Cata.</div></div><hr />

I concede this point.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was more useful in pvp than pve. As GC has said many times, not all abilities were meant for pve.<br />
It was macro'd by pve hunters into every shot, along with kill command, for the extra damage. Removing the damage turns it into a ranged silence which gives hunters utility in pve. Personally I'll still spec it if I can spare the talent point.<br />
<br />
<br />

I think you may be understimating how Trap Launcher can be used but we have lost our best AoE. We can't comment on how hunters will be &quot;left out&quot; until we see the new Multishot but the intention (which they keep restating) is that we won't be AoEing trash down that often in Cata.<br />

So far in dungeons, how many group pulls are there? I remember Blizz stating they wanted to change it to less AoE necessary, but I'm not in beta to see how practical that is. I also can't wait to see if using an explosive or snake trap launcher is practical or a clunky way to get &quot;AoE&quot; damage.</div></div><hr />

I mean how badly do u want to top the trash meters. But hey that's just me. <br />
<br />
But I would still like an ability that looked or felt like an AOE. For some reason Multi-shit doesn't feel like an AOE. That doesn't mean I'm not using it, just saying it doesn't really give that cool looking AOE feel. Volley didn't either but hey at least it was something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why not change Volley to behave like the vrykul archers in ICC?<br />
<br />
My thoughts exactly, I always thought was was a much better looking ability. Why not have an ability that looks like that, and on a 20 second CD. So that way we can still primarily use Multi-shot but have a small burst of AOE dmg to make things a bit more exciting.<br />
<br />
Now I can already feel the &quot;Ohh but how can gun fire arrows? Or a spray of bullets?&quot; questions coming. So to that I say. Why not have 2 distinct AOE dmg abilities that share the same dmg and CD, but just look different visually. <br />
<br />
For instance &quot;Mortar Shot - Fires an explosive round into target AOE area(kinda like what Explosive shot used to be)&quot;. That would be the gun AOE ability. Visually it can have the hunter point in the air and fire a &quot;mortar looking&quot; round. As for Volley, just have it look like the Vrykul ability I quoted earlier. That would be the AOE ability for Xbows and Bows. <br />
<br />
Thats just my 2 cents. But I feel something along those lines would solve the Hunter AOE qq and give blizzard some praise regarding hunters for a change. <br />

CC is a waste of time, a little here and there is fine (Like 1-2 CC mobs total) but seriously it just makes a short and simple dungeon last too long, especially if you have some idiot that doesn't know HOW To CC.

Well if they are going to get WotLK with 3.3 already launched, it shouldn't be all that difficult to farm Triumph emblems to get 232/245 stuff. From there, the hard-core will spend a bit of time in ICC 10 before transitioning ICC 25, kill LK, and then work on heroic modes.<br />

The problem is that it's not just overgearing. All of the content has been nerfed at some point or another (or several) and all of the classes likewise buffed from where WotLK was at launch.<br />

Comparing WotLK's status quo to TBC's is also a bit of a bad joke. You had to be in the second tier of raiding gear before heroics in TBC really started letting up to the point that you felt that, &quot;Hey, I over-gear this place.&quot; In WotLK, you over-geared a level of content wearing that content's gear. (I.E. once you had a full set of herioc dungeon gear then heroics were a breeze.) This problem was further compounded by the fact that you can get second-to-last tier gear with minimal time and effort in WotLK as opposed to TBC's &quot;step&quot; system where there was no skipping ahead and you had to take content one level at a time. It has helped people get into current content faster, but we all payed the price of perfectly good older content being completely neutered of fun and challenge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, I forgot that Blizzard did end up doing some nerfing of the dungeons. Some of it was due more to player QQ than anything else, so I guess that the player base is at least partially to blame here. As for class buffing... I'm not so certain that that really played a part. Could be wrong, though.<br />

Let me try to clarify: I wasn't comparing the overgearing dungeons aspect of my post between WotLK and TBC, and I'm sorry that it came off to you like that. I was actually talking in terms of CC in that last sentence. I believe that there was too little CC for Wrath, but TBC (from what I can recall) went a bit over the top to the point where it wasn't fun. I don't think nerfing AoE into the ground is the answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No need to apologize. It was also partly my fault for confusing CC for over-gearing in your argument, so I apologize if I came off a little nerd-rage-y.<br />
<br />
CC was a little over-the-top in TBC, it's true, but that was only party due to the actual nature of the content and also to the fact that not every DPS class has CC like they do now. There were a variety of other factors as well, such as the types of mobs being affected by CC being much more restrictive than it is now, which led to things like making Priests an absolute necessity for a Crypts run.<br />
<br />
I think the problem with AoE is the wide variance of views on it. A lot of people just lump AoE damage in with single-target damage in a generic pool, and their line of thought is basically, &quot;Who cares if I'm doing AoE damage or ST damage? Damage is damage and I want to do as much as possible at all times.&quot; I think that's been the mindset all through WotLK, and since AoE &gt; ST output if you've got enough mobs, the tank's in no danger, and the healer has infinite mana, the WotLK-ers are simply content to AoE their way through every instance and only worry about ST on bosses.<br />
<br />
Those of us who remember TBC as the heyday of WoW were more comfortable with ST being the norm and AoE being just another tool much like CC (in theory); it had certan situations, certain pulls you used it on. It wasn't an all-inclusive free-pass to faceroll your way through all of the content, and you couldn't, because tanks were actually in real danger and healers had finite mana.<br />
<br />
My hope is that with Cataclysm Blizzard will find the middle ground somewhere were ST DPS is still king, tanks are in real danger, healers have to worry about both mana and output, and both AoE and CC are valuable tools that you can make use of when necessary without either one becoming so overwhelming as to be the defining factor of play in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peta</div><div class="date">2010-08-25, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My concern was better voiced by the hunter that brought up Volley missing and GC responded to; He left the group because all he had was single target dps to contribute to the dungeon group. I remember rogues being left out of groups in Classic, because they were single target specialists. I fully remember having a very hard time getting groups in Classic because hunters only have one CC, Freezing Trap, which everyone always broke anyway. Years later, we have Silencing Shot along with Freezing Trap. Not much has changed for our CC and now we are losing our AoE. These changes could lead to hunters getting ostracized again.<br />
<br />
Lets see what they come up. The whole argument that it didn't feel like you could do with your bow or a gun is bs. This is a fantasy game. Since when can hunters shoot 3 arrows at the same time and hit all 3 targets, Jump back meters in the air, or place frost traps. WTF you are not Legolas. Everyone knows he's the only person who can do those things.<br />
<br />
On a more serious note. I am worried about the amount of cc and hope all classes get something to help out. But just to switch spec so you have a cc is bothersome.<br />
Ive been playing since vanilla and still remember ppl being left out because they did not have the cc. An more recent example is Magister terras. If you had high dps but no cc ppl would go for the lower dps with cc.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I know, QQ. At the start of Beta, I thought Blizzard had a pretty clear view of what they wanted from the various class make-overs, but now I'm not so sure. In the post-talent-massacre world, most changes now seem to consist of &quot;what shall we delete today&quot; rather than tweaking them imaginatively, or changing them for something more appropriate to the class. We have seen what Blizzard can do when they use their imaginations, but this rather smacks of an easy way out.<br />
<br />
I could see why the removal of Mana was a good idea, it never made much sense for hunters to use it (I have two Lv80 hunters) but nor am I sure the way they use Focus is brilliant either. It isn't logical that when a hunter runs out of Focus, they can't do anything except wait for regen, or fire a Focus generating shot. I think an exponential fatigue mechanism would have been better, perhaps affecting Haste, Hit, Crit etc. That is by the by though, I can't see them changing now. It isn't massively different to how my Retadin plays with Mana anyway, so no big deal.<br />
<br />
Volley did feel wrong with guns, yet a perfectly natural thing with bows. After all, it is the shot that was used most by real archers when fighting a real enemy army. Even then, a real archer could loose off 1 round a second, so there's no reason why in Azeroth they couldn't shoot a cluster at a similar rate. If Blizzard are to remove it simply because the animation looks rubbish then that is an Art Department problem. If I were running the hunter makeover, I would ask the developers to come up with a machine gun effect for bullets instead (perhaps with smoking muzzle and red glow from the barrel). Most of the hunter shots don't make much sense with a gun anyway. <br />
<br />
Let us face it, Volley is mostly used against trash. The filler that Blizzard put in between bosses to make things both slower and (theoretically) more interesting. Mana regen is rarely good enough in boss fights that Volley would be effective to use more than occasionally. They keep going on about how they want it to be fun, personally I find it more fun getting past the trash quickly so we can get on with the meat of the raid. <br />
<br />
I'm absolutely sure Hunter DPS will be fine when Cataclysm arrives, if anything they will err on the side of caution initially simply because 99% of players won't get anywhere their current efficiency levels for a few weeks. How Blizz go about it is a different matter, at the moment it just feels like they don't have any Focus on the issue (oh the irony).<br />
<br />
Apologies if this is a bit QQ, I just want to see Blizzard using their imaginations a bit instead of a sequence of deletions.<br />

I must disagree. I am pretty content with the changes made to hunters generally. I do agree that the reason for removing volley is fail one - i would totally be satisfied with &quot;it didnt fit our view of hunter&quot; instead of visual, or what can/cant be done in fantasy world.<br />
<br />
With Cata presumed shift back to more single target dps thrash (or cc) i dont see much problem of such move. Bear in mind we have another aoe - 30s cd, unmovable, need launcher cd but hey - explosive trap(snake trap) and multishot. If they felt like volley was kicking multishot out of bars for such mobs, either buff or nerf would need to be ensued to one and we would end in same position (A&gt;B). Removing is kinda radical thing but it opens some possibilities (i am very vague here - be it talent/glyph affecting multi,dmg buff, more targets affected, ...).<br />
In shine of things like giving swipe cd, making consecrate cd and such, i can see reason for removal of volley. Question is what will happen to other aoe - will it be heavy mana(or other resources) dependent so you cant/wont use it until really big pack comes into play ? Thats the question.<br />
<br />
On power auras : I will stay with my PAC, but i can see the use for new chars/leveling usage. <br />
I like the customization i can do to my notifiers (even sounds), but there is no need to use cannon for killing a bird.</div></div><hr />
