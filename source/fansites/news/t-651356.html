Recent In-Game Fixes - 06/4/09<br />
06/04/09<br />
Commanding Shout and Battle Shout are again free to use during the preparation period of battlegrounds and arenas.<br />
To resolve an exploit we have removed all non-boss chests from dungeons introduced in The Burning Crusade: Ramparts, Blood Furnance, Shattered Halls, Steam Vault, Underbog, Slave Pens, Arcatraz, Botanica, Mechanaar, Shadow Labyrinth, Sethekk Halls, Mana-Tombs, and Auchenai Crypts. <br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
PTR 3.2 will be here &quot;soon enough&quot;<br />
We do not plan to release any animations of the new form art, but the test realms will be coming soon enough so everyone can play around with them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/17367879395-new-druid-art-coming-soon.html))<br />

Allowing rerolls to start at level 55<br />
We've seen requests to add a /level or similar feature before. I can tell you, this is not something we have plans to implement currently, or in the near future. We believe that there is still value and entertainment to be had in the various Terrestrial Azerothian zones.

Achievements - Brewfest rare drop mounts<br />
There are currently no plans to change the setup for this achievement from how it worked last year which is all drops off Coren Direbrew in BRD. Brewfest is still a ways out though, so changes could happen. Last time we talked about this there were no plans to change the drop rates or remove it from the meta. Like I said before, things could still change, but don't be surprised if nothing changes. [...] I doubt we will make them purchasable with tokens, if we want to make changes to this we will likely go a different route.

Overpowered Death Knights<br />
Personally when I make a joke about DKs being OP, I am alluding to the the fact that they were OP, particularly right after we shipped. We got some things wrong and we've been correcting them. To deny they were too powerful would make us look ill-informed or overly defensive. I like to be as honest with the community as I can be so that there is a chance the community will trust us when we lay out our design intent on something. <br />
<br />
[...] I will say that we don't think DKs are perfectly balanced, but we don't think they are dominating tanking, dps and PvP to the degree that they once were. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17615362449-blizzard-could-dks-have-a-bit-of-honesty.html))<br />

Appearance of new forms<br />
It's hard to really get a feel for their exact appearance in a frozen shot with only one type of lighting. I think you'll see certain tones that may not be as apparent in the screen shots come out more in-game, especially with the night elf forms where there are very subtle variations in tone throughout each cat and bear model to give them that Darnassian look.

<br />
Restoration 4 pieces T8 Bonus<br />
It's not a hot. Genesis does not affect it because Genesis only affects the periodic healing of Rejuv, Regrowth, Lifebloom and Wildgrowth. Empowered Rejuv affects all healing, so it affects it. Improved Rejuv works like Genesis. We typically don't count procs from items as &quot;your spells&quot; but it just depends on how the talent is set up. <br />
<br />
[...] This is going to sound technical, but this is the way it works.<br />
<br />
Empowered Rejuv says &quot;the bonus healing effects on your heal over time spells.&quot; What it means is &quot;the bonus healing on Rejuv, Regrowth, Tranq, LB and WG.&quot; The set bonus heal is treated as Rejuv.<br />
<br />
Improved Rejuv says &quot;Increases the effect of your Rejuvenation spell.&quot; What it means is &quot;the periodic healing of Rejuv.&quot; The set bonus is treated as Rejuv, but it is not a periodic heal, so the talent doesn't apply.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to lawyer our way out of this. I'm just explaining why the bonus works as we would expect it to work. I could see a case for changing Improved Rejuv to affect the set bonus, but honestly we are unlikely to do that. As players point out, the bonus works really well already. Furthermore, we try as a general rule not to monkey with existing talents to make items work a certain way. There are thousands of items and many of them are only relevant for a few months, while the talents themselves are relevant for years. It isn't worth the risk or baggage to change a spell to work with an item most of the time. We did recently make an exception for the Balance set bonus and we will continue to do so as needed.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Holy could become &quot;too good&quot; if it was changed<br />
I meant &quot;too good&quot; in the sense of healing per second and longevity. You can spam very fast Holy Lights virtually forever, or at least much longer than the typical boss encounter lasts. The big negatives for a Holy paladin right now are having insanely high overhealing (but who cares since mana is cheap?) and having a narrow niche of single target (usually tank) healing. Improve the efficiency (not mana efficiency but replace the overhealing with actual healing) or let paladins heal multiple targets at once and I think it would be hard to argue that any of the other classes could compete. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367602316-question-about-double-standard.html))<br />
<br />
Holy Paladins issues<br />
I agree nobody would get benched for overhealing. But when mana does matter then overhealing does too. Some paladins are saying &quot;Yes, I overheal but what choice do I have?&quot; which is fair. It's a liability, though perhaps a small one. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17367602316-question-about-double-standard.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I would say lack of ability to heal multiples and lack of ability to move. We have let other specs creep into the paladin role with perhaps not letting the paladin creep out enough. Again, we're not talking about overhauling the Holy tree or getting 5 new healing spells next patch. While we're not prepared to announce our plans yet, I also don't want anyone's imagination to run wild here.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=660) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br />
Chain Heal in Ulduar<br />
Looking at a 10 minute Ulduar fight with a very competent Resto shaman, I see 100 Chain Heals, 80 Lesser Healing Waves, 36 Riptides, and a couple of NS'd Healing Waves. (Like many heals, HW isn't going to be attractive until hp / mana matters.) I'm not going to out this player for you to Armory him, so you can say he needs to L2P if you want. :)<br />
<br />
Different shamans heal differently, but we find the assertion that CH is dead to be a little overblown. There are some improvements we can make to Resto, especially for PvP, and they still seem to need mana (or at least MP5) more than some of the other healers, but we really don't think Chain Heal is in a terrible place. If you're on tank healing duty, you're going to CH less. If the raid damage comes at predictable intervals, then priest and druid AEs may stomp on yours. But when your groups are tight and the damage is coming in constantly (Thorim for instance, though that is not the fight I referenced above) then CH is a great spell. We'd rather see shamans mixing up their heals as above than doing 90% of healing from the one spell.<br />
<br />
[...] We're okay with CH being used more on some fights than others. That means it's up to the shaman to know the best times to use it versus switch to another spell, which we think is more interesting than always having a go-to spell for every occasion.

<br />
Tidal Waves<br />
I'd just like to know if it is intended for Tidal Waves to get relatively worse as we pick up more haste due to the GCD, until we get enough mana regeneration to sustain healing wave spam (unlikely right now or in the near future) instead.<br />
This is something we plan on addressing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17619782879-shamanpve-is-blizzard-still-not-convinced.html))</div></div><hr />

Yeah right. After having leveled countless characters to 60 or 70 on variuos realms I can't really see any fun in it anymore. Unless you are using RAF and have a few buddies to go instancing.<br />
TBC leveling is getting old too, it's just doing random quests for the XP and wait till you finally ding 68 so you can leave these forsaken (!) lands.<br />
So, I can't see any harm in letting ppl start a character at level 55 or even 65 if they have leveled at least on char 1-80 on any given realm.</div></div><hr />

I think vezax is the only fight where mana is an issue.<br />
Anywhere else, 70+ overhealing at the minimum, which is insane.<br />
<br />
They could make it like:<br />
* If your heal lands on a target with 100% health, it jumps to a secondary target and heals for 25% of the original heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How does that logic work out?<br />
<br />
- They start at lvl 1: You have to play through alot of (apparently) boring stuff before you can get to the fun parts. Which will likely cause some to not bother.. and thus not giving money to bliz..<br />
- They start at lvl 55: You get to skip all the boring parts and can after some short leveling get to do all the fun stuff alot quicker, which would mean more fun overall for the players and thus more ppl continuing to play and pay bliz..<br />
<br />
So, by the logic of &quot;lowlvl is boring, highlvl is fun&quot;(which is the basics of the whole &quot;let us start at higher lvl), bliz would keep more subscribers if they went through and let them start at lvl 55... not the other way around</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rages</div><div class="date">2009-06-05, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If Blizzard wanted to make people really, really happy then they would make it so we can customize each form independently and give them a gender look simple by using Jewelry and color options. I was thinking for Tauren they could change the horns and make them turn down or make them smaller for females. Female jewelry should be female looking kind of like the chocker the NE Cat is currently wearing now and male should be rugged (think about how Tier 6 looked, tribal with bones). Also I think face and shoulder marking colors could enhance this too. Simply lock down jewelry and color options based on the sex of the character.<br />
<br />
Hopefully Blizzard will listen and make it so that each form is editable independently. I’m wondering if they did that because they couldn’t put a Bear or Cat in the Barber chair and thought it we can make it work just go off the humanoid forms colors. If that’s the case here’s an idea for you make a Druid Barber shop in Moonglade that lets you customize your Bear and Cat forms as well as future Tree and Moonkin forms. I’m always happy any time I have a reason to use Moonglade recall and what better reason then this!<br />
<br />
To make this work right you would need for people when they first log-on the day this is introduced to have the same look. I would try and make it as close to the original models as possible (by this I mean color wise and don’t add any jewelry). I imagine this would make many people happy. I know I love the color of my current NE cat and bear and possibly would be happy just to keep them like the original art. But more than likely I would be headed straight to Moonglade to pimp my forms out. However it would be nice to have a classic button at the Barber shop that puts you back to old school colors.<br />
<br />
If your reading this and you like what you are reading make sure to reply and say so post this idea on as many forums as you can get the word out and let’s make this happen!</div></div><hr />

If youre bored so easily in this game, maybe its time to look for something more exciting.<br />
<br />
To be honest I wonder if a lvl55 premade would help anything to relieve that boredom, it only gets you faster to lvl80, so you can farm yourself silly for that one time per week raid. And no, dont tell me thats exciting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
People are addicts, they'll still play whether their alts start at 1 or 55. However, they have the option to use recruit a friend for way faster leveling, which generates a lot of money for Blizz in game sales, the subscription fees for the second account and sometimes even transfer fees to get the characters on one account.</div></div><hr />

Having a lvl80 character is a reward. A reward for leveling all the way, spending hours and effort on it. Why should you get this for free?<br />

Similarly, high level gear is a reward. A reward for killing a boss, spending hours and effort on it. Should people who don't have time raiding, just like you don't have time leveling, also get this for free?</div></div><hr />

If you don't want to keep doing those quests, stop making alts. However, if you want to make a new alt - you have to do those quests again.<br />

I have dozens of alts, and I love leveling. I don't know if you're following the same monotonous patterns, but Azeroth is huge! I'm working on Loremaster now on my main, and I've discovered quests that I didn't even know existed. And when I say dozens of alts, I mean it. Well on my way to 5 80s~! (this does not mean I do not have a life. I just know how to utilize my time.) I've done starting quests so many times @_@ yet, the only ones that are really very boring to me now are the human starter zone quests. The rest...well, I could roll half a dozen night elf alts and play them all to level 20 just because I find the quests so engaging, and then never play them again. Or half a dozen draenei. Or half a dozen...you get the idea. <br />
<br />
Don't just stick to a set leveling path, even if you think it is the most efficient. Wander off the beaten path and have a bit of fun~</div></div><hr />

Well most of the comments are going to be just about this. The only ppl who it pisses off are the ones that have lved numerous alts already. Those that havent are thrilled that theres a possibility that it might happen. Imo i do want this too happen. I just dont like lvling more than onces but i still would like to experience other class roles like tanking and healing and pvping as well. I dont see getting to 80 as a &quot;big reward&quot; cause i already had that feeling with lvling my main. the only alt i currently have is my dk which is still at lv 75(stacking double exp and then go back to lving). i tried to lv others but questing the same things just suck maybe cuz i have to travel alot(former comment).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This the reason why it cant happen. Cuz all their work they had to go through to lv that alt to 80 would seem a waste of time since some other guy gets 55 lvs free. The next day blizz decides to implement that change: &quot;omg some idiot didnt have to go through 55 lvs to lv his alt and i did&quot; &quot;i wasted my time, screw this game /quit&quot;. they would need to reward these players somehow if they were to implement this.</div></div><hr />

And honestly, the only reason I want to have an alliance toon in Northrend is the Wrath gate event and alliance PoV of the fight in Undercity.

Seriously, post like this by those stupid, yes I said stupid elitist players sicken me. Sure I make sure I know what I am doing read up on a few fights, know my BIS gear, but god forbid if I put my life on hold to play a game. A GAME. This is a form of entertainment, that is all. To say that a &quot;casual player&quot; is not a &quot;real&quot; player, is just sad. I am sure you don't like it when &quot;casual&quot; players assume that you the &quot;real&quot; player is some 40 year old virgin sitting at your computer thinking about a Night elf every night right? Then please show a little respect to the rest of us &quot;casual&quot; players who do their best to scrape by. (not saying that pushing 1.5k dps doesn't make you horrible...)<br />

Look at it this way too, the &quot;casual&quot; players out number the &quot;real&quot; players, if this wasn't the case more guilds would have downed all the hard mode bosses have their drakes, and beat Algalon. Those &quot;casuals&quot; who play anywhere from 2 hours a day or 2 hours a week, keep this game funded and running just as much as you &quot;real&quot; players, so try showing them some respect. Besides after all if all the &quot;real&quot; players just sat at home playing WoW all day and not working (not saying they do just hypothetically) then who would pay for the game that we all know, love and enjoy? And since we have established that there are more casuals than &quot;real&quot; players, wouldn't it be in Blizzards best interest to cater the needs of the majority of their business? They do have a company to run after all. Just some food for thought.<br />

On another note, these druid skins kind of make we wanna roll a druid now. I didn't do so because I thought the Tauren Druids always looked ridiculous, now I am kinda excited, better start that grind I guess.......</div></div><hr />

Seriously, post like this by those stupid, yes I said stupid elitist players sicken me. Sure I make sure I know what I am doing read up on a few fights, know my BIS gear, but god forbid if I put my life on hold to play a game. A GAME. This is a form of entertainment, that is all. To say that a &quot;casual player&quot; is not a &quot;real&quot; player, is just sad. I am sure you don't like it when &quot;casual&quot; players assume that you the &quot;real&quot; player is some 40 year old virgin sitting at your computer thinking about a Night elf every night right? Then please show a little respect to the rest of us &quot;casual&quot; players who do their best to scrape by. (not saying that pushing 1.5k dps doesn't make you horrible...)<br />

Leveling is a big part of MMO:s, THATS BORING LOL is not reason enough, I guess Blizz could just give you free lvl:s to 80 and also give you full naxx gear because naxx is also boring!<br />
<br />
Stupidest idea ever. I hope these arent the same people that complain about Blizz making the game too casual-friendly..<br />
<br />
<br />
THIS IS WHY WE CANT HAVE NICE THINGS &gt;.&lt;<br />
<br />
But to be Honest there are parts of the old world that just suck especially for specific classes. Ive leveled a RETARDADIN!!! A Rogue, A Mage, A Shaman, A Warrior, and a DK now with a hunter being my next goal. Like if anything there should be a /level to 30 at max just because then you have a mount, your class is much more defined by that time with more spells to make things easier. And those saying &quot;casual this and that&quot; think about it... they may start higher level but they will also be gearless and have to purchase all of their spells, mount skill, and mount in bulk. In the end it would be kinda pricey and take time to get the gear from instances unless you just buy ah stuff.<br />
<br />
So in the end id say that if you have at least 1 level 80 then allowing you to skip to level 30 would not be that big of a deal.</div></div><hr />

blizzard already does enough to accommodate lazy + casual players. letting people automatically have lvl 30-55 chars is just giving in to the whiners who don't like to work for their lvl 80's. :/ not like there isn't 3535 accounts getting sold on craigslist by powerlevelers atm as it is. o.0</div></div><hr />

How is leveling from lvl 30 to 80 not working for your 80? I mean Jesus Christ. It's 30 levels that avoid the most mundane and ridiculously long quests. I dunno about you but I don't enjoy running across the Barrens 6 times to complete 3 quests. And SO what if Blizzard is doing things to accommodate casual players? Aren't they doing things to accomodate you hard core gamers? They freaking desined boss fights just for you hard core players. They made a boss who is only accessable to you. What more do you want? What more do you need to feel like you are better than the rest of those &quot;casual&quot; players? Does Blizzard need to let you level to 90 while the casuals are forced to sit at 80? Do you need more gear? Do you need mounts that only you can get? (Oh wait you have that) Do you need them to just delete all our accounts so all thos elite players can play by themselves. Maybe you would like your own server where you have to have such and such gear, or x Arena rating, or X playtime to be able to play there. <br />
<br />
Starting at level 30 (55 is a little much) is NOT that bad of an idea, I mean honestly. It's really only until level 30 do the classes seem to have a little bit of diversity to them, before that you really aren't that different from the other classes. Hell I saw a hunter actually tank a level 15 instance over a warrior cause there was no difference between them really. Both were wearing mail and the hunter had a pet to help him with aggro. <br />
People are losing intrest in level this is obvious by how many people are asking for a /level 30, and since casual players are the backbone of the game due to the fact there are more of them than the &quot;hard core real&quot; players. Catering to casual needs and whims over &quot;real&quot; players needs and whims, would be better for buisness.<br />
<br />
Hell if is really a problem for all you &quot;hard core gamers&quot; then don't use the function if they ever impliment them. If you feel the need to actually suffer through walking 500 miles to fall down at some door then by all means do so. We casual players all bow to you!</div></div><hr />

This :) Except hunters wear leather until 40 :P But seriously I agree. I mean /level 30 would not be so op.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">epitaph</div><div class="date">2009-06-09, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">here's my $.02, between +10% xp shoulders and triple xp from RAF, you can go 1-60 in as much time as 3 days, and as little time as 10 mins (I did that with my priest). You can level up so fast now that you skip 90% of quests, as well as scrape by with not learning you class.<br />
<br />
To be honest, people don't really learn about their classes any more until atleast 60, probally 70 and likely 80 when they show up in VoA.<br />
<br />
a /level 30/55 would not really change the game at all. The differences would be thus:<br />
<br />
1)No more spam for runs through SM.<br />
2)People wouldn't have to pay Blizz to PL to 60 anymore.<br />
3)Account selling would take a hard hit.<br />
3)End of Story<br />
<br />
Personally I think they leave it as it is, but increase the gold earned from quest rewards so people don't have to farm gold on their mains to feed alts. I doubt it would affect the economy at all if every quest 1-60 earned 1g. People barely do quests now anyways.</div></div><hr />

Worst of all is that they don't even know how to play it and they don't know that DKs don't use SPELL POWER....<br />
