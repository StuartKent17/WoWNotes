Patch 4.3 - World Event Pets No Longer Bound on Pick Up<br />
An interesting change is made to pets in Patch 4.3, all world event pets are no longer bound on pick up.

Guild Master Dethrone in Patch 4.3<br />
In Patch 4.3, Guilds with inactive guild leaders can now impeach their GL and replace him with another active user. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/gmdethrone_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/gmdethrone.jpg)<br />
<br />
For more information, check out the announcemend posted a month ago. <br />
In the event that a guild leader takes a leave of absence and remains inactive for an extended period of time, it can be difficult for some guilds to carry on as normal. To help assist with these situations, we're introducing a new system in patch 4.3 known as &quot;inactive guild leader replacement&quot; that will allow players of the appropriate rank to take over leadership of a guild from an inactive guild leader via the Guild tab.<br />
<br />
The way inactive guild leader replacement works is pretty straightforward. If a guild leader’s character is inactive for 30 days, a notification will appear in the Guild News &amp; Events feed which can only be seen by guild members who are eligible to become the new guild leader. To determine eligibility, the game will look for the highest ranked character in the guild that's logged on in the past week, and any guild member from that rank will be able to request guild leadership simply by clicking on the notification.<br />
<br />
As with many actions in World of Warcraft, clicking on the notification will open up a confirmation window which, once accepted, will transition leadership from the inactive guild leader to the first player to request leadership. If guild leadership is changed, the old guild leader will be notified via email to his or her registered Battle.net address. While some players may need to log out and back in before their Guild tab will visually update, the change in leadership will be immediate, with all ranks and permissions remaining in-tact.<br />
<br />
Please note that if you're an active leader of a guild, this system should not affect you or your guild. The goal of inactive guild leader replacement is simply to allow guilds which have found themselves without leadership for a long period of time to resolve the situation on their own without the need to contact our In-Game Support department.<br />
<br />
Inactive guild leader replacement is currently live on the PTR, but keep in mind that it may be difficult to test, as a guild leader will need to be inactive for a full 30 days before the option to transition leadership will become available.<br />
<br />

It's 30 days of not logging into a character that is in almost all cases your main character. If you are still playing the game, this should never happen anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno - it seems quite reasonable to expect the leader of a guild to log on at least once a month. If the guild leader is going to be away for longer than that for a legit resaon they can temporarily transfer leadership to a trusted officer on the understanding they they will transfer it back. <br />
<br />
The only addition I would like to see to this service is that there should be a reminder service associated with it where the guild leader gets a (out of game) email warning them it's going to happen. Or at the very least a message on all their alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The alts could've done some Pumpkin bags across Azeroth to get the pet as well :P Remember, the actual level requirement for Hallowed be thy Name is 21, and that is just to enter the Scarlet Monastery (a low-level character can enter an instance of the event boss already created by high-levels)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont recall any notice of that. I recall them saying the loot bags would only work during the event so you couldnt save a bag from the previous year in the hope of getting the new loot.<br />
<br />
You used to be able to save the loot bad from HH (when it dropped item level 200 gear) and hold onto it until year and open it to try and get the 365 loot, as long as you hadnt opened the bag yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dthamilaye</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 08:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the guild leader thing kinda messes things up for those that keep up an old guild as their bank.<br />
<br />
We had a small but working guild in vanilla. Later on people slowly left for other guilds and only their bank alts and such stayed behind. My alt became the guild leader and I bought guild bank space for my own stuff. At the moment there are few bank alts of people that appear once every few months and then old characters that have not been logged in for several years.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm checking on my guild leader alt every week or two, but after this change I think I really should just kick everyone else out of the guild to prevent my own stuff becoming accessible to someone that just happens to log in after a year or so (assuming I havent checked on my alt for 30 days). I would like to keep all the old players in the guild but not sure if I want to risk it. This is where the new system sucks.<br />
<br />
Though, alt bank guilds with some random old players probably were not the most important thing in Blizz mind when they implemented this change.</div></div><hr />

You don't because there wasn't a notice. They are making the Winter Veil pets only summonable during Winter Veil, but all other pets have not even been mentioned in such a change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Half if not all the ones they mentioned as not being summonable outside of Winter veil require snowballs to summon. <br />
<br />
If it were not for the engineering thingy that makes snow balls these pets would not be summonable outside of winter veil anyways, due to requiring a snow ball to summon them in the first place.<br />
<br />
No other pets that come to mind immediately have such a requirement.<br />
<br />
The wolpertinger does not require hops<br />
the spring rabbit does not require an egg<br />
<br />
<br />
Tiny snowman requires a snow ball to summon.<br />
Winter's helper (the gnome) requires a snow ball to summon</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mic_128</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 09:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the guild leader thing kinda messes things up for those that keep up an old guild as their bank.<br />
<br />
We had a small but working guild in vanilla. Later on people slowly left for other guilds and only their bank alts and such stayed behind. My alt became the guild leader and I bought guild bank space for my own stuff. At the moment there are few bank alts of people that appear once every few months and then old characters that have not been logged in for several years.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm checking on my guild leader alt every week or two, but after this change I think I really should just kick everyone else out of the guild to prevent my own stuff becoming accessible to someone that just happens to log in after a year or so (assuming I havent checked on my alt for 30 days). I would like to keep all the old players in the guild but not sure if I want to risk it. This is where the new system sucks.<br />
<br />
Though, alt bank guilds with some random old players probably were not the most important thing in Blizz mind when they implemented this change.<br />
<br />
It goes down the roster, so you could always stack any other alts in that guild, so bank alt loses the throne and only bank alt in guild rank #2 can get the promotion, ect.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, just log onto yuor bank alt once a month. Doesn't seem hard.</div></div><hr />

Not to squash your dreams, but every one that wants these enough to pay 100's for them either has as many as you do, or deleted them because they already have it learned. You still may make a few gold out of it, so it's definitely worth waiting to auction them. Who knows, maybe you'll get lucky.</div></div><hr />

No other pets that come to mind immediately have such a requirement.<br />

The wolpertinger does not require hops<br />
the spring rabbit does not require an egg<br />

Tiny snowman requires a snow ball to summon.<br />

I managed to collect 44 pumpkins and 11 cats on the last 3-4 days of the event by doing all the trick and treats in the world on my 10 chars :)<br />
<br />
Had hoped for this to be kept &quot;in the dark&quot; for just a bit longer so more people had deleted their extra pumpkins. At least I have the cats who will be VERY unique since I doubt many bothered to buy extra of those if they didnt know about the non-BOP part.<br />

For the already BoE Winter Veil pets, this should be just a tooltip fix anyway.No newer pet had &quot;Binds when Used&quot; anymore.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably for pet battles, down the road.I doubt we will actually sell the whole pet, as in lose it in the process, this will only cause issues with pets that you can only acquire once (mostly, those rewarded by quests)<br />
I think when we sell e.g. a level 25 Sinister Squashling, we will keep a level 0 version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't remember the vial ever being BoP - but the example that came to my mind first was http://www.wowhead.com/item=37835 , a world drop trinket that was obviously BoP by mistake/oversight, and even that did not get un-bound from people that had picked it up.</div></div><hr />

Kick all the noobs out of the guild if you plan to leave for any extended time, or your private guildbank will be gone when you come back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To the first one to request it? No consensus among equal-ranked members? That's a recipe for disaster if I ever saw one.</div></div><hr />

No consensus among equal-ranked members? That's a recipe for disaster if I ever saw one.Imagine how long the wait for a game-enforced &quot;consensus&quot; would take if some officers quit the game as well? And if the officers bicker about who's going to become the next guild leader, you have more problems than a missing GL anyway, and this is just the metaphorical last drop.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2011-11-06, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Impeach is a misnomer. That literally means &quot;Bring your guild leader up on charges of breaking the law.&quot; Coup would have been a better word. An easy way to handle this if your guild is taking a break, especially if the guild is worth stealing is to simply kick everyone except your friends you can trust to hand it back. I went through this and essentially booted everyone except 4 accounts of characters in preparation for these ridiculous changes. That way the Rank 9 can't just log in and take the guild over because they are the highest rank to log in in the last month. GM rank in many cases is the person that built the guild. The Officers are generally online friends of the GM, and they should have a way to contact the person. Guilds should have always been treated as fiefdoms and the character property of the account holder. This option to allow anyone who logs in within the past month and has the highest rank is ludicrous, especially among the guilds that were built to cater to smaller groups that go into and out of the game regularly. If your GM and O's haven't logged in in a while, then it's time to locate another guild if you're lonely, not usurp the position. This is virtual theft and a heavy handed maneuver by Blizzard to insure GM subs don't cancel.</div></div><hr />

I'm confused now, is it monday/tuesday the 11/7 and 11/8 or tuesday/wednesday 11/8 and 11/9? Or did I just get lost in my own calendar?</div></div><hr />
