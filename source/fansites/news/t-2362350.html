Battle for Azeroth is making substantial changes to World PvP as well as adding more arenas and a new battleground!<br />
<br />
<br />
New Arenas<br />
Two new arenas are being added to the game. One will be set in Tiragarde Sound and the other in Zuldazar.<br />

<br />
<br />
World PvP<br />
<br />
The PvP vs PvE server distinction is going away, replaced by a toggle set by each player. You can toggle being opted into PvP or not when you are in town. <br />
Players that feel trapped on PvP servers now have a way out. This opens up the game to changing and improving the World PvP rule sets. <br />
There are two main audiences: Players that play on PvP servers because that is where they ended up that don't really want to be there and players that love World PvP and want more of it. <br />
New content like bounty hunting or assassination quests can be introduced as an option now. <br />
There will be bonuses to experience, reputation and other things when you are questing with PvP mode enabled to offset the inefficiency.<br />
The team hopes this will build a foundation to make World PvP great again. <br />
<br />

<br />
Island Expeditions - PvP Mode<br />
Island Expeditions take some of what the team liked from Mists of Pandaria's scenarios. These expeditions take a team of three players of any roles to uncharted islands across the Great Sea in search of Azerite (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Azerite). Each island is randomly generated, so there is always something unique and new about the experience. This feature uses advanced AI in its Normal to Mythic difficulties, but teams of three players from the Horde and Alliance will also be able to queue up against each other in a PvP version!<br />

<br />
<br />
New Battleground: Seething Shore<br />
In Patch 7.3.5 a new battleground called the Seething Shore will be introduced. This new battleground takes place in Silithus (https://www.wowdb.com/zones/1377-silithus) and features the Horde and Alliance descending upon the wound that Sargeras (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/126010-sargeras) put in Azeroth to fight over Azerite bubbling to the surface.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dynamic control point game play- Both factions will fight to control points on the map that are not always in the same spot. Control points are random and have many different spawn locations.<br />

<br />
New Brawls<br />
There are no specifics on new PvP brawls being added to the game, but Blizzard has stated that more are coming in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP Talents<br />
The team has said that there isn't likely to be any substantial changes to PvP talents but do plan to make rotations more similar between PvP and PvE.<br />
<br />
How do you view PvP templates?<br />
The team likes the PvP talents, however, it is hard to put that into the outdoor world. They recognize how unbalanced World PvP is. The team wants you to be able to customize your character more in PvP. They are looking at the scaling technology to use within PvP, basically using the same tech that lets low levels party with higher levels. They are reworking the reward structure in PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Official Preview<br />
While there are many new PvE experiences waiting in Battle for Azeroth, there are also some new PvP updates for players to look forward to.<br />
<br />
In a new Battleground, Seething Shore, players of the Horde and Alliance will descend upon Silithus to battle over the Azerite bubbling to the surface. This Battleground will offer dynamic control point gameplay similar to Arathi Basin, but with new control points appearing periodically as resources are depleted. This new Battleground will require coordination as you and your team work to overcome the opposing faction. Since this Battleground actually serves to tell part of the story that leads to the events of Battle for Azeroth, we also plan to offer a preview of the Seething Shore during patch 7.3.5 as we continue to build upon the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance for the coming expansion.<br />
<br />
Beyond instanced PvP, we’re also reexamining how PvP plays out in the outdoor world. The PvP system hasn’t fundamentally changed since the launch of World of Warcraft; however, so many other systems that shape the world, ranging from flying mounts to cross-realm zones, have changed the way players interact. We’ve heard feedback lamenting the decline of world PvP over the years. Meanwhile, there are players on PvP servers who don’t necessarily enjoy that gameplay, but also don’t want to switch servers and leave their friends behind. Looking ahead to Battle for Azeroth, this feels like a great opportunity to update the PvP system to better reflect the state of the game world today.<br />
<br />
The core of our plan lies in bringing all servers together under a single PvP ruleset. Players will ultimately be able to choose on an individual basis whether they want to opt in to PvP gameplay or not. While in a capital city, you’ll be able to opt into world PvP, and you will venture out into a PvP-enabled version of the world, populated by other players who have also opted in to PvP gameplay. This also provides a universal foundation upon which we can build new world PvP systems that previously would have inherently excluded everyone playing on a PvE realm.<br />
<br />
For those who do opt in to the PvP experience, there will be some slight bonuses such as extra experience gain or reputation gain to offset the additional risk. The nature and magnitude of these bonuses will undergo extensive tuning, with the goal of not making anyone feel obligated to participate in PvP if they dislike that gameplay, while counterbalancing the loss in efficiency for those who do.</div></div><hr />

As I understood it, it doesn't keep you on your realm alone when opting into pvp. You get phased with everyone else who opted in, not sure how wide the pool is. If it's all the realms or a chunk, but I recall them saying it'll be an even pool of Alliance to Horde, and everyone you encounter will be pvp enabled. <br />
<br />
You might want to level opted in for the incentives. If they provided, let's say, 25% more xp and rep while questing, that might be worth it? I'm not sure, I never pvp. This is all just what I took away from Blizzcon but I don't have official communication to share.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats my understanding as well, so lets use some primary school mathemathics and logic here: You have 100 players total, 60 horde and 40 alliance. Distribute all players into any number of phased zones/servers so that each phased zone/server is equally balanced. <br />
<br />
If you do this correctly you will gain an achievement and a special title &quot;the impossible&quot; as a reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i mean, it will work for the first few weeks, but then people will start realizing that solo queuing puts you at a huge disadvantage against premade teams, and then some teams are just better than others and will always win regardless of how much the loser tries to catch up (and will in fact be at a deficit since the rewards that are used as a means of progression will further increase the gap between them). ultimately it will only ever the worth it for the BEST of the BEST teams, and everyone else will have a more satisfying and more efficient experience playing the normal PvE modes.<br />
there's no way to make it balanced, even if they added some MMR system and normalized the PvP rewards at 50% winrate, it'd mean the cream of the crop are getting essentially double the rewards of everyone else, even the PvE guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, the class imbalances and the presence of PVP healers make it a snooze-fest for me. HoTS has more characters (even if you consider each spec in WoW a &quot;character&quot;) and is much closer to balanced.</div></div><hr />

I'm a shadow. My PvP will be turned off immidiately when I get that option. The fact that when I created that shadow in classic I had the most fun doing PvP says it all about the situation of open PvP and shadows today. Or in other words: I'd rather force a rusty nail into a wall with my forehead...upside down...than doing open PvP these days(and we are not just talking about legion...1v1 has been unbalanced crap for around a decade.

The system is not bound to PvP or PvE Realms and as it will phase people, who opt into it, together, it will probably be balanced numbers wise for each faction.<br />
<br />
Here's a question: Why do people complain about 1v1 or that healers are unkillable in a 1v1 (which is not 100% true, I can burn a Hpally down even as shadow)? The game isn't balanced around 1v1s, thats why there is no arena for 1v1. Healer need to heal vs at least one person as in a 2v2 arena match they will go against at least 1 DD AND the other person who also got some cc and/or dmg.<br />
<br />
Also all the people who say &quot;I don't care about PvP&quot;, why be so loud about it? Just don't use the feature. <br />
<br />
To get back to the post - I would've liked an option for the poll that goes something like &quot;yes, but only sometimes&quot; as I won't be bothering with PvP when im doing some WQs and watching youtube in the meantime, but when I'm in the mood for some PvP, why not?</div></div><hr />

Have you ever tried Ashran in Legion? 3-4hours of waiting time and after the game starts it ends in 10mins becuase &quot;not enough players&quot;. They cannot even fix that... but they want new ones?<br />

I mean Blizzard destroyed the alliance. I played 52 bgs in the last two weeks (the random ones) --&gt; 7 wins and 45 losses. WTF is that? Every good player is in the horde. PVP balance is a joke. It is only about grinding for toys and flags. Or paying 3rd party websites to farm the 100 wins for season mounts in 3v3.<br />

It trully seems it will be a filler exp. I think they work on Diablo 4 with an extended team and WoW has far less devs nowadays. They really want the money of the diablo fanbase because the Blizzard managers know they can sell any trash with the diablo title...</div></div><hr />

This is the result of not removing racials. I had a similar experience in Legion which is why I no longer play, repeatedly getting matched with players that ignore the objective and prefer to get farmed instead is a waste of time. I would rather play CS or other games, at least you can carry there and offset other people.</div></div><hr />

Healer need to heal vs at least one person as in a 2v2 arena match they will go against at least 1 DD AND the other person who also got some cc and/or dmg.<br />
<br />
Also all the people who say &quot;I don't care about PvP&quot;, why be so loud about it? Just don't use the feature. <br />
<br />
To get back to the post - I would've liked an option for the poll that goes something like &quot;yes, but only sometimes&quot; as I won't be bothering with PvP when im doing some WQs and watching youtube in the meantime, but when I'm in the mood for some PvP, why not?<br />
<br />
Go and kill a Mistweaver monk or a Resto Shaman.. Then come back here and write about killing healers, the game should be balanced around 1v1, not everyone goes around doing 3v3, as a warrior main I hate pvping, we are sitting ducks vs range, killing healers is a nightmare, I have more chance on soloing a mythic boss in HFC ffs, they need to stop designing the game around 3v3 arenas and start focusing on world pvp/1v1/rated BG's... All big maps are pro range and anti melee, once you balance that out then you have a great pvp experience for all..</div></div><hr />

Being PvP flagged will supposedly give some bonusses. That means I will play with PvP on and take the occasional pvp fight/gank in stride while levelling. If however I meet with corpse camping I will simply go to a city, switch it off and play PvE only until the babies are bored.<br />
<br />
I'm lauging my ass off doing WQs on my brewmaster these days. It seems mainly Demon Hunters havent yet discovered they can't gank me anymore. I'm getting my sweet revenge on the notorious gankers that ganked me when I was still questing as windwalker. Keep bringing it, suckers!</div></div><hr />

umad? seriously, some people play on pvp servers because that's where their friends are. when i rolled a pvp server we were promised there wouldn't be an honor system without a dishonor system, i stay because i have friends I've been playing with for 10 years. maybe when horde complains about not having anyone to 10v1 because pvp server pops are fooked we'll get some dev attention to the faction problems...</div></div><hr />

I have read the post and PvPers already get PvP rewards without them being shoehorned into a PvP shard/server.<br />
<br />
<br />
You most likely only do LFR or don't play at this game judging from all your previous post. You're already missing the elite PvP unique mog and Mythic unique mog anyway so why bother about other mog you will miss ?<br />
<br />
I prefer Normal over LFR to be honest, quicker and easier considering you usually get better players. But I have Heroic progress too if that's what you care about. Either way the Mythic mog isn't exclusive forever and the elite PvP mogs are stupid with how they're taken away. All timed exclusive content is stupid in my eyes.<br />
<br />
On topic: I care because a world PvP mog would be within my skill set to reach, meaning I'd have to opt in to a server type that I despise for the sake of getting a transmog or mount that I might really want.<br />
<br />
If you want world pvp to have benefits give them buffs like &quot;500% more honor from killing players in the world&quot; and a massive dump (The equivalent of completing a quest) of experience every time you kill a player within three levels of your own.<br />
<br />
That'd reward world pvpers for doing world pvp without making others feel like they'd have to join in to get special rewards.</div></div><hr />

I'm not even advocating the BfA open PvP changes but your argument is just silly. All you have to do is flag your character for PvP and leave the capital.

Its not out of spite, theyre adding incentives because it will be considerably slower to get things like farming mats and doing quests with players going around ganking or fighting. As of right now, theres no reward besides a very miniscule increase in honor level for killing other players in PvP. Theyre probably adding incentives to offset the chances of being ganked or fighting as well as to promote PvP in general. Titles, extra mats, gold, transmogs, and mounts for incentives sound fine, god forbid people stick out from one another in WoW.</div></div><hr />

More Honor and exp from killing players sounds fine, that’s encouraging world PvP without incentivising none PvPers.<br />
Titles, transmog and mounts wouldn’t offset the inconvenience, it would add incentive for those who hate world PvP to do world PvP. It takes PvP servers and turns them into an activity that you’ll feel pressured to do rather than a legitimate choice.<br />
<br />
Letting players level to 110 from killing players in the world alone? Fine. Reaching max honor via the same method? Fine. Those offset the inconvenience and add suitable recurring rewards. The rest doesn’t.</div></div><hr />

Ok so those who hate doing quests or PvE but want a mount/transmog/allied races from rep or a dungeon is fine but when it comes to WPvP thats not allowed? Hypocritical, again you dont want to do it? Dont do it.<br />

Not really...the true reward is (hopefully) faction balanced PvP among those actually interested in PvP.

If Alliance ends up outnumbered on the PvP Shards thy will quickly stop using the toggle at all...leaving nobody for the Horde to fight and handing them rewards for free, which will cause the system to fail.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not making excuses for anything, lol - MMO-Champion is not representative of the playerbase at large, regardless. In fact, I was surprised at how many voters voted &quot;No&quot; in the first place...I guess a lot of the MMO-Champion population has aged (read: matured) along with the game. I suppose it helps that the true PvP'ers go play games meant for PvP instead of a side attraction (making it more of a casual affair) in a PvE game. <br />
<br />
I actually hope this brings back players who want to play the PvP side game because of better balance...more players is always a good thing.</div></div><hr />

There should be rewards(cosmetic etc) from different aspects of the game, thats what made this game great before until people like you cried to be spoonfed everything and wanted there to be zero uniqueness within the game.<br />
<br />
Organised PvE and PvP give those kinds of rewards.<br />
<br />
Questing is part of world PvP since it puts you out in the world to get ganked.<br />

PvP phase shouldn’t get extra rewards beyond honor and exp because the PvE phase won’t either.<br />

Titles, transmog and mounts wouldn’t offset the inconvenience, it would add incentive for those who hate world PvP to do world PvP. It takes PvP servers and turns them into an activity that you’ll feel pressured to do rather than a legitimate choice.<br />
<br />
Letting players level to 110 from killing players in the world alone? Fine. Reaching max honor via the same method? Fine. Those offset the inconvenience and add suitable recurring rewards. The rest doesn’t.<br />
<br />
PvPers are forced into PVE in this expansion more than ever. Oh? Run a 6 min mythic+ get 915-960 ilvl gear and 4 billion AP. Oh? Just won a 20 min BG? Here take this 870 piece and 800 million AP.<br />
<br />
Yes in higher end arenas you have a CHANCE of getting a piece of gear that is halfway decent and a very VERY low chance of legendaries. <br />
<br />
It is easier to run mythic+ and LFR to gear a fresh toon for PVP. Even then you are forced back in next raid tier for those sweet 930-960 pieces while struggling to get a drop or possible duplicate 870-915 piece from bgs and arenas.<br />

Oh boy! Got a duplicate piece of gear after an hour of BGs. 1-15 Echo of battle. 74-50 more to go to buy a 905 piece!<br />

Compared to going around argus for an hour killing rares, invasion points, and chests(which can give 880+ tokens and high chance of legendaries) on top of veiled crystals to turn in for 910+ gear.<br />

Oh the classic &quot;its a minigame&quot; argument, just so youre aware Warcraft the series was based on Human vs Orcs aka Horde vs Alliance aka both PvE and PvP. To say that PvP is a &quot;minigame&quot; is non-cannon it is just as much end game content as PvE, WPvP was a big feature in Vanilla and it should be now its disappointing that it hasnt been. Oh wahh PvPers are getting something, I dont want to PvP so they shouldnt get it.

How do any of these changes help players stuck on PVE realms? It goes both ways. They are effectively turning all servers into PVE servers and that is frankly disgusting.

<br />
My problems with WPVP have nothing to do with flying or faction imbalance or anything else potentially solved by a toggle. It has to do with the ridiculous imbalance of the entire system. It has to do with the fact that Blizzard acknowledged they would never be able to balance PVE and PVP simultaneously and yet decided not to turn the system that was their solution on in WPVP. It has to do with the fact that tanks were invincible for 75% of the expansion--and I don't mean 1v1, I watched a BDK in my guild tank five people simultaneously in a Bareback Brawl without dropping below 90% health--and their solution was to make healers invincible instead. It has to do with the fact that rogues can kill you in a stun, despite having 5 million health and a Prydaz shield, by pressing Shadowstrike and Eviscerate. (But don't worry, only twice in a row with a one minute recharge. Surely we're balanced now fam.) Or how a Boomkin can get himself a Full Moon proc and drop 3-4 million damage on your head in a single cast before you know you're in PVP combat.<br />
<br />
If they fix that shit, then I will toggle on PVP and see how it goes. if they don't, I won't even give it a chance. And right now I see nothing about even preliminary plans about how they're going to try to fix these issues.</div></div><hr />

You don't comprehend what the change does. They're decoupling the concept of world PVP from server type. If you turn it on, you only see other PVP enabled people. If you turn it off, you only see non-PVP enabled people. You won't be running around flagged and see non-flagged people. They're just using crz to lump all the pvp people in the same instances and the non pvp people in different ones.<br />

Basically you feel entitled to rewards just for being on a PvP server. That’s your only argument for this. Entitlement.<br />
<br />
More like getting rewarded for participating in world PvP (and winning). Playing on a PvP realm doesn't mean that you participate in world PvP. Remember timeless isle? Unique mount/pet only obtainable through PvP and the most effective way of farming it was open PvP on the timeless isle (which was amazing btw). Did you complain then? Probably not because the mount was shit (so was the pet). Your argument isn't about game design or creating meaningful incentives. It's all about you wanting nice things without actually participating in the respective content. Because that's what it is: content. World PvP is going to be simply another PvP activity by the looks of it and there's no real difference to instanced PvP except for some balancing aspects. There'll probably be enough zones like Black Rook Hold arena in which you'll find alot of players. There you'll grind a few HKs and then go on your merry way and switch back to PvE after using one of your 6 Hearthstones. There's virtually no difference between this and instanced PvP and you should really stop disguising your feelings as rationality or accuse others of feeling entitled after using that twisted logic of yours. Makes you look a tad ridiculous.<br />

The way I see it is that PvP should have exclusive rewards, World PvP shouldn't. Just like raiding/deungeoning should, but world quests shouldn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was always this way though. World quests/dailies offered you certain rewards (usually tied to reputation) like mounts, tabards etc.<br />
We wouldn't even need to have this discussion if Blizzard didn't fuck around so much with world PvP in Legion. Normally, world PvP occurs naturally and doesn't need incentives. When you totally butcher the game via number inflation and instead of balancing the game as a whole, introduce templates that don't work in open PvP, people will stop playing open PvP because it's simply not enjoyable. What Blizzard is doing now is simply the 'instantiation' of World PvP but it's merely a band-aid solution.<br />
When it comes to rewards/incentives they should probably stick to the model they've had with the timeless isle. Introduce a currency that is farmable through other PvP activities but world PvP always awards the most.</div></div><hr />

So basically if you want to do things effectively like level up and get your rep grinds done in a timely fashion to get ready for PvE content Asap you have to keep PvP on.<br />
<br />
So for most of us who wants to do things the most effective way turning it off is not even a option.<br />
If they want to make it a real option you should only get PvP benefits like small amounts of prestige from quests and maybe like the odd pvp token basically shit that is irrelevant for someone that just wants to PvE.</div></div><hr />

OK, that's all the hint I need to know that PvP will forever suck. That and the small talk that classes will remain mostly the same in BfA, I think I can see where this is going.<br />

Add all the BG's and PvP server options you want, PvP will still suck without real depth to combat.<br />

and it complicates matters if they make unique rewards for world PVP because people will cheese it with friends and let them kill them to get rewards and things of that nature. so world pvp will likely have no real unique rewards and as you said will be just people ganking like it always has been, so nobody will do it.<br />

It's characteristic of Blizzard to stop making significant changes when it comes to PvP after they've destroyed the PvP playerbase (because that's not at all an indicator that something went wrong). They simply can't admit when they've made a mistake so they keep on course.<br />

In the German language we have the wonderful proverb: &quot;Konsequenz heißt, auch Holzwege zuende zu gehen.&quot; which basically translates to: &quot;Consistency means sticking to your path - even if it turns out to be a blind alley.&quot;<br />
I always though it was quite fitting when it comes to Blizzard's PvP design philosophy.</div></div><hr />

indeed, makes no sense, even on max lvl there is 60 to 40 horde - alliance PvP participation so why on earth would I opt in?<br />

For the bonus to rep and 'other things' that he mentioned. You two obviously got as far as the experience part and stopped reading.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc17dca7fbbd</div><div class="date">2018-01-05, 06:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny how negative people are and how &quot;much&quot; they read about the topic. All this talk about &quot;I don't want to change my server&quot; or &quot;it will be 60/40&quot; is nonsense. <br />
The system is not bound to PvP or PvE Realms and as it will phase people, who opt into it, together, it will probably be balanced numbers wise for each faction.<br />
<br />
Here's a question: Why do people complain about 1v1 or that healers are unkillable in a 1v1 (which is not 100% true, I can burn a Hpally down even as shadow)? The game isn't balanced around 1v1s, thats why there is no arena for 1v1. Healer need to heal vs at least one person as in a 2v2 arena match they will go against at least 1 DD AND the other person who also got some cc and/or dmg.<br />
<br />
Also all the people who say &quot;I don't care about PvP&quot;, why be so loud about it? Just don't use the feature. <br />
<br />
To get back to the post - I would've liked an option for the poll that goes something like &quot;yes, but only sometimes&quot; as I won't be bothering with PvP when im doing some WQs and watching youtube in the meantime, but when I'm in the mood for some PvP, why not?<br />
<br />
then go ahead and do the math, PvP participation is 60:40 horde:alliance ratio, show me the math, destroy me, come on, show me how are they going to balance those numbers on every single server, distribute 60 horde and 40 alliance players so that every server/phased zone has 1:1 ratio of horde:alliance<br />
<br />
its either 6:4 ratio horde favoured gankfest which will result in all alliance opting out during the first month, basically a disaster (Ashran 2.0 type of stuff) because those people will never turn it on again no matter what changes they make on the way (history shows us they are horrible at bandade-fixing broken stuff in the game).<br />
The other possibility is 4:4 on some servers while some will be 2:0, basically free stuff for horde (or horde will get nothing in such situation), its bad either way.<br />
<br />
&quot;it will be 60/40 is nonsense, it will probably be balanced numbers wise for each faction&quot; why? Nothing points towards your &quot;probably&quot;. Do you have any facts to back your thinking? Im not talking about distribution of players on PvP realms, who cares about that lol. 60:40 is instanced PvP faction ratio. People who voluntarily opt into PvP today from all servers, PvP, PvE, RP, whatever.</div></div><hr />

Oh grow up. This whole 'Blizz doesn't care anymore' bullshit has been getting spewed around ever since the game was launched, and it's always been untrue. Don't know what I expected coming into this thread besides the usual 'blizz sucks circlejerk' you guys love so much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no I didnt but you obviously stopped reading my comment...whats it going to be? 5% bonus rep? It wont be huge so PvE players wont be forced to opt in. So I have a choice to grind rep some 5% faster while being ganked all day long (thus making it longer more than those 5%) or simply opt out and get the same rewards anyway.<br />
<br />
Rewards wont be amazing, raiders would bitch about it all day long thats guaranteed. It will be some pets, mounts or other fluff. I see how many PvPers care about those things today...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">nodq</div><div class="date">2018-01-05, 07:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing is, that what makes PvP servers PvP servers. Is thefact that you can get attacked at any time or you can attack at any time in the open world. even if you actually do not want it to happen at this particular moment. that was the point that made PvP realms and and open pvp what it was. Witht hose changes they actually will kill the real PvP servers with the minimum what was left. So now, people can disable PvP even on &quot;PvP&quot; servers. And the reasoning is: &quot;some people may not like to be on a pvp server....&quot; I mean, seriously Blizzard? Why did they transfer or created a character on that server then? WHere is the logic behind that. And because of that, those players on real PvP realms get fucked over even more. <br />
<br />
Blizzards logic is, that this system will revive open pvp, but the it will happen the other way around, people will disable it and never turn it on again and forget about it and therfor &quot;PvP&quot; realms become even more inactive in terms of open world pvp. And they can add whatever they want to motivate people to turn it on. It has to be some massive buffs/items/xp to force people to do that, and then you have the problem, people are forced to do that to get stuff. Does that sound familiar to you guys? It was the massive shit storm that Ashran got when it was introduced, people complained that they had to DO IT to get items and stuff, they were actually forced to do it even tho they would have prefered not to, and not just because Ashran was terrible, no because they didn't want to do anything other than arena or BGs. <br />
<br />
I'm tellin you guys right here, this will happen 99,9% for sure. Just like they messed up the Honor-Talent and prestige shit, shortly after Legion release they changed that all back so that you do not need to get every talent from beginning after prestiging, and why? Because NONE did it, because it did reset your talents that took quite some time. And you were gimping yourself in arena and BGs by doing so. Especially Arena. So kinda the same mistake they did with Ashran, &quot;forcing&quot; people to do this shit to get prestige rewards or they do not do it because they just wanna play Arena and BGs. Blizzard will pull a triple fail on this, trust me guys. They are that dumb when it comes down to PvP stuff.</div></div><hr />

By merging Pvp/PvE you won't earn you will lose, already many ppl on my PvE raiding guild said if next exp is mostly pvp they will stop playing. I'm playing wow since 2005 non stop and always on a PvE server, the less times I tried Pvp was because I was bored to death and I get more bored. <br />
There are two kinds of players and you cant merged to one.. those love raids/questing and not have a sugar-fed kid at his ass and the pvp gung players who feel great when they kill others.. keeped this way or else you are going to lose huge amounts of players.<br />

can you stay on topic? Where did I say I dont care about PvE? Or pets or mounts? I have some 600 pets, some PvP mounts from Legion as well...<br />

When did I go off topic? In any activity if you want the reward you need to perform the task that rewards it. If you don't want to turn on your pvp flag to earn something, then you obviously don't want it enough. It's no different than the challenge skins or the title for 100,000 honorable kills or such. I don't like to do arena or battlegrounds so I accept that I don't want the rewards that come from them enough to do something I despise doing. Same thing here. Complaining that you &quot;have&quot; to do something you hate to earn a reward you want is the epitome of entitle imo.</div></div><hr />

are you blind? Im not crying, im not whining nor am I complaining...wtf? Seriously...I am just pointing out that people will not participate for rewards such as these and you turn it around, make up nonsense and go personal. This is not about me or you, its about whole playerbase which suffers from huge faction imbalance in PvP participation. My question still stands: why would average Joe opt in world PvP if he is going to get facerolled in 1v4 gankfest? For 5% extra experience or bonus rep? Thats the issue here. I personally dont care about the rewards because I only care about balance gameplay which is not going to happen based on information we have.</div></div><hr />

Personal insults are not needed. As I said before, if you're not willing to do what's needed to earn the reward than you don't want it enough. That's a simple concept. Average Joe, if he wants the bonus exp, rep, and 'other things' they said will turn on his pvp toggle. If he doesn't want it bad enough, he can accept it and do without.</div></div><hr />

Then come back here and write about killing healers, the game should be balanced around 1v1, not everyone goes around doing 3v3, as a warrior main I hate pvping, we are sitting ducks vs range, killing healers is a nightmare, I have more chance on soloing a mythic boss in HFC ffs, they need to stop designing the game around 3v3 arenas and start focusing on world pvp/1v1/rated BG's... All big maps are pro range and anti melee, once you balance that out then you have a great pvp experience for all..<br />
<br />
The thing you have to understand is, that if you balance it for 1v1 OR rbg OR Arena, then it will be unbalanced for all the other modes. Thats just how it works especially if you work with so many factors. There is no &quot;do that and all will be happy&quot;.<br />
Just because you like 1v1 doesn't mean the next person does.<br />

People who voluntarily opt into PvP today from all servers, PvP, PvE, RP, whatever.<br />
<br />
A quick google search tells me that the overall faction distribution is 49-51. As open world PvP will be part of World quests there is no telling how many people will opt in. Those number you are talking about are instanced PvP characters(?) and therefore not really representative of the numbers we can expect. <br />
There are people (my friends and me included) who don't really like the stat templates. They balanced the game, yes, but I like to use my PvE Trinkets. We never play bgs/arena but often do World PvP. <br />
<br />
That shows that we can't tell NOW how many people will use this feature LATER. <br />
<br />
&quot;It will be a 6:4 gankfest&quot; From what I can tell how blizzard uses phasing right now there are roughly 20 people in one phasing - sometimes more sometimes less - so we are speaking of one or two people more per PHASING, which can be quite big for a world quest, for one faction. Thats not much, especially as you can expect people to opt into OPvP and just do their quest without attacking other players. <br />
<br />
&quot;Horde will get nothing in a 2-0 scenario&quot; I don't think PvP Kills will be part of the requirement to get extra loot, so it would be free stuff for the horde.<br />
<br />
&quot;Do you have any facts to back your thinking&quot; Nothing but common sense. If they use special phasings that ONLY PvP players join, then there will be some kind of queue like Ashran which will invite new players only if there are enough players on the other side. If not, then you will probably join a new phasing. <br />
<br />
Yes there is a &quot;probably&quot; again but neither you nor I work at Blizz or can tell the future, so we just have to wait and see how it plays out. If it is shit, then don't use it and continue playing only bgs/arena.</div></div><hr />

well instanced PvP is the best estimate we have at our disposal because its the people who voluntarily &quot;turn PvP on&quot;, they are looking for it, overall faction distribution tells us nothing<br />
<br />
sure many people will turn it on in the beginning but will soon find out there is faction imbalance, thats why I say its going to be Ashran 2.0 type of system, the moment horde gets upper hand the hordies who just try out new system will keep it on, alliance players will turn it off and difference will grow larger<br />

I dont claim I know the future, but I know how PvP population behaves today and without other significant changes to PvP I dont see this system working<br />

Sometimes tanks are unkillable death machines. Sometimes healers are unkillable while dishing out tons of damage unless you have a coordinated team of 4 people to bring them down. Sometimes you die from 100% to 0% in 3 seconds, sometimes you get ganked and when you defend yourself the agressor can't be punished, because he jumped, rolled/flying tiger kicked away, vanished or dashed out of combat.<br />

<br />
<br />
Instanced PvP is completly different content because of stattemplated and objectives, you will find people who never join a bg or arena just because you can get extra loot/xp from world quests.<br />
Also it's way quicker than those PvP modes as you don't commit to 5-30 min PvP but instead turn it on and if there is a PvP god nearby then you just turn it off again. People don't have to die to a 20 man premade for 20 min. <br />
<br />
But to get back to the problem: Why do you complain about a feature that was just announced in it's most basic form, not even implemented on beta/PTR?<br />
Why not just let it play out and see if it will work? Even if it won't work, it's a relatively small feature that won't cut a new bg map or raid. As long as they fix problems like oneshots (which they did before Antorus launched, which shows they care at least a little bit) the feature will at least be fun to try.<br />
Or be helpful and try to find a solution instead of &quot;It won't work, OPvP sucks!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yeah go figure, I hope they don't force us warriors to go range in BfA, just like the CLUSTER F*** in Ashran....<br />
<br />
I don't think warriors are not in the top arena teams because they get kited, as there are wheelchairs...eh I mean DKs in the top 25. I think they lack Utility, like hardCC, or spread damage to compete against the top tier. But that doesn't mean they are unplayable (as you can see at #95). It's the same for PvE - just because the top 10 guilds run 10 affli + shadows doesnt mean it's mandatory but it makes things easier/faster.<br />
<br />
As for Ashran: yeah, being a melee sucks there, but that is a problem that won't happen in OPvP or those islands as it's not 40vs40 on one single objective. As I said, the game isn't balanced for that, it's designed somewhere around 2-5 people hitting you, not 40.</div></div><hr />

I understand what you are saying but still, the game is way to anti-melee, they need to figure that out asap, it's annoying, the mount of pressure you get vs range is ridicules, I've tried 2 range classes so far, a warlock and a hunter, I swear to you I have no pressure what so ever, no sweaty hands or the thought of 50 things going through my head at all, vs my warrior, oh boy, you get 50 thoughts going through your head none stop, do you target the OP boomkin? the hunter? or the immortal paladin throwing he's skills at you and staying out of your weapons range... It was a bad example but still, thats what we usually face none stop, there is a lot I can go through but don't want to, cause this isn't going to change anything.... I bet I will be forced to change my fav class in BfA.. Hence even thinking about it right now (which I really don't want to, I love this class too much) :P</div></div><hr />

It is sending a signal that if you want to level faster then you are indeed forced to go PvP<br />
and if your not a PvP and only want to enjoy PvE then you are screwed because Blizzard <br />
wants to force everyone into world PvP.<br />
<br />
fucking casual</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bornlol</div><div class="date">2018-01-05, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">honestly this is getting pathetic, they add a new bg or new arena maps and expect anyone to be excited about it. It's recycled garbage and obviously fillers to try and keep the game alive, they do nothing innovative anymore<br />
and the fucking sad part is what pvpers actually want isn't even anything innovative its just simple upgrades/changes that they don't even give a shit enough to do<br />

and to all the damn idiots saying &quot;if you want to level faster then you are indeed forced to go PvP<br />

<br />
YOUR GONA LEVEL SLOWER IF YOU'RE GETTING KILLED EVERY 5MINUTES SO GUESS WHAT? THE ONLY THING THE BONUS XP DOES IS NEGATE THAT - USE YOUR DAMN BRAIN YOU WERE BORN WITH IT FOR A REASON.</div></div><hr />

How will this work when I opt out of PvP and then group up with my two friends who opted in?<br />
Will I then be forced to into PvP for grouping with them?<br />
If so then this is no different from a server jump as I still can't group with my friends.</div></div><hr />

to this point we already admitted that they left pvp to die and no amount of &quot;changes&quot; is going to fix the big amount of damage they did to it.<br />

sorry for the bad english</div></div><hr />

Here (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2362797-Will-you-miss-PVP-Servers?p=48589052&amp;viewfull=1#post48589052) some of my thoughts on this matter</div></div><hr />

Then come back here and write about killing healers, the game should be balanced around 1v1, not everyone goes around doing 3v3, as a warrior main I hate pvping, we are sitting ducks vs range, killing healers is a nightmare, I have more chance on soloing a mythic boss in HFC ffs, they need to stop designing the game around 3v3 arenas and start focusing on world pvp/1v1/rated BG's... All big maps are pro range and anti melee, once you balance that out then you have a great pvp experience for all..<br />
<br />
Uh if youre talking about Arms Warriors they can destroy healers if they play properly as well as ranged classes besides Arcane Mage(Which every melee has issues with). The game has always been balanced around 3v3, what you’re complaining about is WPvP which isnt balanced at all due to legendaries and instance PvP having templates. Hopefully in BfA they go back to not using templates, allowing customization and balancing with spells having reduction while toggled for PvP like they use to IE Mortal Strike does ____% less in PvP situations.</div></div><hr />

You get one shot by any pve player...This change will be the last nail in the coffin... Maybe 40% of people in poll said they will opt in but in reality it will be like 5%... Who would that to play in a desolate world by himself... Another stupid design decision made in order to create safespace for casul pve babies who rolled wrong server... This game has lost all of it's original warcraft 3 identity by now. At least there's classic im looking forward to though I'd prefer tbc or wotlk. I hope that blizz won't butcher classic by catering to casuuuls again cos that's their policy for some time now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demosis81</div><div class="date">2018-01-31, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I greatly dislike the idea of &quot;balancing&quot; the inherent inefficiencies of leveling on a pvp server/shard/experience/whatever you might call it. You're taking a risk by opening yourself to endless ganking at quest givers, and you want to grant bonus exp? No. Just unflag, quest as you would, and if you want to flag, have at it. I guarantee that the exp bonus will have to far outweigh any &quot;convenience&quot; of a pve experience, esp once people are hitting 120. It will be impossible to do anything after the first week or so in any zone. You want pvp? PvP for the sake of PvP, not an exp bonus. If anything, the devs should dis-incentivize ganking at any level. Not incentivize camping, which is what they will be doing.</div></div><hr />

The PvP aspect of this game brought the game to new heights/esports it all started back in vanilla and it probably ended after Cata.<br />
<br />
Shame the whole premise of this game was Horde Vs Alliance not kill X dragon , loot and repeat then go to sleep. It's on blizzard they messed everything PvP wise from gearing , pruning , to stat distribution and ended when they catered to these PvE plebs who can only do one thing left click a target.<br />
<br />
No matter what they do nothing will save this game after this Legion absolute joke of expansion. So all the RP kids can rejoice they're endless scripted fights won't change ! Keep at it boyz !<br />
<br />
Typical pvp boy haha, I do PvP aswell and you are cleary blind if you think WoW has ever been a good game for that.</div></div><hr />

Clearly you never played vanilla , BC and WOTLK , that was PvP at it's highest.</div></div><hr />

More than anything though, it's fun.</div></div><hr />
