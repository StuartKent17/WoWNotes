Blizzard CMs<br />
I'm looking for Blizzard participation in the forums. I know it's not a 'directly profitable' function and probably is the first thing looked at when 'do more with less so we can pay a bigger dividend' comes up. But it's a good long term investment to engage your customer audience.<br />
We agree and the WoW CM team has only grown since the game was released (&quot;do more with less for bigger dividends&quot; sounds very cynical and has never been an operating procedure for us). We've taken on a host of various responsibilities over the years, but community engagement remains a primary objective.<br />
<br />
That said, our &quot;customer audience&quot; expands well beyond these forums and we have to keep that in perspective. There needs to be a larger engagement strategy so our time is well managed.<br />
<br />
On a related note, I'm not going to have much time at all today to engage the community because I'm organizing a lot of data in Excel. But that data will later be used to inform how, where, and why we engage the community. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364572-gms-in-the-forums-are-a-good-thing/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16543825060?page=1#11))<br />
<br />
10% Damage Reduction in PvP<br />
Simply put, we felt that PvP damage was too high across the board. There were several changes in Patch 6.1 that caused a general increase in PvP damage, and this change was meant to counterbalance that. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364575-10-damage-reduction-in-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16544975176?page=5#84))<br />
<br />
Hunter Pet Damage<br />
We've just pushed a hotfix that reduces the Cornered damage increase from 50% to 20%. It'll still probably be wise to kill Hunter pets at low HP, but that should make the strategy of purposefully summoning a pet at low health significantly less effective.<br />
<br />
20% is still more than 0. So they're still going to do it.<br />
Sure, but it's a much more dangerous tradeoff considering how quickly a low-HP Hunter pet can be killed. There's significantly less reward for the risk. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/364569-psa-if-the-hunter-pet-is-low/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16543824827?page=2#31))<br />
<br />
Blood Elf Model Feedback<br />
The feedback was gathered? i'm not sure about that. &quot;my weapons are far too big!&quot; was said about 5 billion times and they still went forward with it. the smug expressions are still there and the terrible run animations are still there.<br />
<br />
Weapon size is a divided topic for sure. We saw lots of feedback (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3988401767) before the models changed that weapons (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3523323517) were (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15538335548) too (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/15355236696) small (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12675388849). I think we adjusted weapon size back and forth during testing to hit a spot that most people were happy with, but I know some of you'd still prefer something smaller.

6.1 was on the PTR how many weeks? And you couldn't see that there was too much damage? And, why not just scale BACK those changes instead of a blanket bandaid that does nothing to really address the problem? Was there no oversight or review or testing of the 6.1 changes?<br />
<br />
What the hell do they do all day in Irvine? It's not like they're revamping the classes again, or building or tweaking new battlegrounds. What is the PvP team doing all day? This is insulting, how little effort they're putting into their own game.</div></div><hr />

Stones in this context means abrogator stones from Highmaul, the BrF ones are elemental runes, so you wont benefit from the catchup on them until your main has finished the elemental runes stage of the legendary.</div></div><hr />

HAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
A PVP season that has been very &quot;oldschool&quot; thus far... They were going to reduce the amount of CC in WoD. They were going to increase health pools to stop people getting killed in seconds in WoD. Neither of those things has been the case AT ALL. CC is still retarded as always (they even started out with 8 second kidney shots!!! which they nerfed only a while later..) and I've seen my fair share of practically one shots as well.<br />
<br />
They didn't want to use &quot;pvp resilience&quot; and &quot;pvp power&quot; any more, so they let the PVP gear automatically scale up in PVP battle.<br />
<br />
Now they noticed they fucked up. Solution? 10% flat nerf in PVP damage!<br />
<br />
First they make your gear stronger, and then they nerf the damage you do with it! :D</div></div><hr />

When my Belf Male goes female from the Transmorphic tincture, his massive two hander shrinks to the size of a short sword at best. That's silly, especially when Females aren't that much smaller than males, and gnomes get bigger weapons than Belf Females. One handers and Daggers being too big is an issue across the board though, but that's seperate to Belf Females weapon size.</div></div><hr />

There's a wide gap between unfriendly to alts, and allowing any alt to instantly catch up <br />

Dis. The idea that because you grinded once, you should get a 710 heirloom on all your characters is silly.</div></div><hr />

That's silly, especially when Females aren't that much smaller than males, and gnomes get bigger weapons than Belf Females. One handers and Daggers being too big is an issue across the board though, but that's seperate to Belf Females weapon size.<br />
<br />
Haven't really look at by BE Paladin, but did Blizzard nerf already small weapons on female BE?<br />
<br />
It is kindy silly, when both human and NE females have way larger weapons than BE. Heck, gnomes females with weapons look as if they were taken from some anime.<br />
<br />
In terms of scale between body and weapons, BE female have it just weird and even 2h weapons does not really look like weapons anyway.</div></div><hr />

It is the wrong direction to go. Stop the Druid instant cast madness, make almost every heal interruptable, increase manacost/cd of dispell/purge/CC/interrupts/anti-cc/anti-slow, then we are starting to get somewhere.<br />
<br />
PVP should just be taken out of the game.. Its costs us too many raid tiers on the PVE side.... :p<br />
<br />
I got turned off by PVP in WOW a long time ago. Its like they made it a second game in a game. Always felt if you didn't start right when the expansion starts you are so waay behind it very painful to even try to catch up.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, the old one would give crappy potions sometimes like waterwalking, but I had the option of mailing the good stuff (int pots, agi pots, etc) to either my main to use or to sell them on the AH. Now I just get soulbound crap on my alchemist who I don't care about using pots on. So I just have stopped doing that daily altogether.</div></div><hr />

I don't have a problem with the &quot;loot specific item off specific boss&quot;, like the &quot;Core of...&quot; steps in the Heroics, etc. Because then you at least go through each of the wings once, even if only in LFR, on the alts.<br />
<br />
It's the tiresome &quot;collect ## [random shit]&quot; by farming them ad nauseum when you just want to move on, or maybe take a pass that week because there isn't much more gear you can get from it anyways, but nope, gotta go or else never progress in the chain.<br />
<br />
It's why I'd like the collection part to be account wide, and the &quot;specific item&quot; steps to be per character.</div></div><hr />

For example surrounding a unit with dk+ghouls or archmage +footmens.Unit pathing is also very important. Warcraft is a macro+micro strategy game. But its most important difference from other rts games is its speed and detailed battle micro.Otherwise it will be like c&amp;c renegade or age of empires series. I hope they keep in mind these important parts before the final release. Btw I forgot to mention that camera distance was closer than the original one or at least it seemed so.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc14a888ba76</div><div class="date">2015-03-12, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, after 6 weeks we finally got a blue post about the blood elves and then it's just about the one relatively irrelevant topic they can reasonably defend (female weapon sizes, which indeed were among the very few things changed, because people got all hysterical about toothpick weapons) while dodging the countless posts that present criticism of the models themselves, especially that of the males which were just dumped on the PTR and noone ever bothered to revisit on the basis of feedback, artistic merit or just plain common sense really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blood Elf expressions are still smug - smugger in fact - but listen to how they speak, look at how they live, look at their priorities when it comes to building small outposts! They're a really stuck-up race and the faces match that. And while it's true that I personally prefer rougher and more tribal races, Blood Elves are actually my third favourite race after Troll and Undead. Of course, that's just my opinion. <br />
One difference, they're not proud (or &quot;stuck-up&quot; if you will) without reason; they are supposed to be elegant and have high cultural standards for themselves.<br />
<br />
However what they got is not some &quot;stuck-up&quot; face by someone with class and a well-cultured background, it's some stoner's self-complacent douchebag grin. The models are but a parody of the race. They look too frigging unevolved to be able to even read, like a race of common orcs except more full of themselves. As for their expressions.. we could go on for a while about their D-shaped whalemouths and derp-faces, but rather not.<br />
<br />
Yes they look smugger than ever, which is because they actually didn't really look all that smug before but rather proud and determined. You seem to have misunderstood that such is the very complaint. And it's a valid one: there is no justification to add a new twist to the models because someone thought it would match the sillies better if the males of the race would look like jokes themselves (or more likely they couldn't compute male + attractive + elegant because they've just been drawing apemen, monsters and female butts their whole life). Oh and like jocks, which is another downright bizarre twist they obviously never should have went for. Sadly, that debate has gotten old now and the outcome was that Blizzard didn't give enough of a damn to make good on their promises of authenticity for the new models, so here we are, with shit for hopes of inclusivity and maintaining racial identity, and another huge letdown about the game in the quality department.</div></div><hr />

I know BW doesn't even reduce the cost. I just think it's a waste of spell being put in action bar. Let's just take it off so other ppl get their turn to dispel. More dps actions for us, NO DISPEL JOB \o/, Oh hell no not glpyh Tranqulizing shot. NO thanks.</div></div><hr />

I'm enjoying this xpac but so far we've got little of what you promised. Stat squish did nothing (already back at 300k - 500k hp), You promised less CC and well i'm reasonably sure we ended up with more CC, you promised less instant heals which is true for every class except Rdruids.

Because The game was not built to have PvP. It was added as a mini-game after WoW initially released. There will never be balance because there is none to be had. I, personally don't care much for mini-games. Some are fun. PvP, in this game, is not.</div></div><hr />
