Boss info<br />
Health - 13M (25-Man) / 4M (Normal)<br />
<br />
During the latest PTR testing phase, the boss was fairly bugged and there isn't much we know about it. Razorscale fly over the area and players starts the event by talking to the dwarves here. As soon as the event starts Dwarves will start repairing the turrets here while the players deal with the trash.<br />
<br />
Once the turrets are fixed, the dwarves use them to bring Razorscale down to let players engage her. She uses the following abilities:<br />
Wing Buffet (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62666) - Knocks back enemies in a 35 yards radius around the caster. <br />
Flame Breath (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=64021) - Inflicts 17500 to 22500 Fire damage to enemies in a cone in front of the caster.<br />
Flame Buffet (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=64023) - Increases the Fire damage an enemy takes by 1500 for 1 min.<br />
Devouring Flame (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63816) - Spits a Lava Bomb at an enemy, inflicting 8788 to 10212 Fire damage and deals 8788 to 10212 Fire damage every second to anyone staying within 6 yards of the explosion. (25 seconds duration)<br />

<br />
Druids will make their return don't worry... its just a matter of time.<br />

I would say in the next season or two, once stamina and resilience increase even more. These two stats favor both the druid and the partner. Survivability. <br />
<br />
And most likely Warriors will also begin to enter the picture. <br />
<br />
Still struggle to understand how WoW can be taken as quite a serious eSport with so much RNG and unbalance. I'll never know.<br />

Not surprised by these statistics, I just hope things will balance out more in the next round or season. It looks quite bad when you represent the data on graphs...</div></div><hr />

One thing I picked up from the commentators may be applicable to those graphs, and that was that the US teams tended to pick counter-teams. The whole comment was Asian vs US play styles in tournament and the comment went that US players tended to pick teams that countered as much of the possible combinations that the enemy team might pick while the Asian players would pick a team they felt comfortable with and practice it to perfection.<br />
In practice this means US would be more FOTM prone, although it is not due to public opinion directly but rather an analysis of what they are most likely to face. <br />
<br />
Fair enough, the implication is that the Asian players in this regard would be more skilled, but that doesn't mean they are more successful or &quot;better&quot;.<br />
<br />
From my point of view, though, all I can say is &quot;I'm not surprised&quot; and &quot;look exactly like last year, but with different classes&quot;. That's what happens if you try to paste PvP onto PvE or the reversed. Either aspect get... messed up. And WoW PvP is about as interesting and cutting edge as EVE Online's PvE used to be*<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Haxxored</div><div class="date">2009-03-18, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The major problem with Arena play is that Blizz insists that they want to balance all games and classes around the (bring whoever you want) mechanic. Problem with that is that besides being terribly stupid it also means that they have to balance every spec to have some PvE and PvP utility. There stated goal is &quot;if you really love holy spec you should be able to do both PvP and PvE as a holy&quot; but they are never going to fix it so that every spec and every class performs as well as every other there are always going to have specs that match up with other classes and specs to perform the best and those FotM groups are going to trounce others.<br />
<br />
The way to fix that is to go back to the PvE, PvP, Utility model with talent trees. With duel specs allow players to save 3 in stead of 2 spec choices and implement PvP secondary trees into they hybrid classes so if you want to PvP as Ele then go ahead there is a 2nd Ele shaman tree for you to choose from. That way they only have to balance the PvP classes against one another thus lessening the blow to PvE players. <br />
<br />
The handicap to this theory before was the burden of respec costs and the feeling of being forced into a spec well duel spec allows the swap from PvP to PvE / Grind specs for free and new PvP trees in Hybrid / Tank classes make it so you don’t have to play Holy / Resto to do all right. As for pure DPS classes Im sorry but youll have to go back to PvPing as Subelty, Suvival, or Frost then again if your a hard core PvPer your probably already playing a spec that fits the PvP environment best not your play style anyways so no real loss.</div></div><hr />

US is represented by DK/Pally/Lock as the preferred combo. While EU still has a nice mixture including hunters and priests in their top teams. EU doesn't seem to be heavily dominated by DKs, which is interesting. <br />
For neither side of the world to have a druid or warrior is simply hilarious. I too disliked the druid domination in the past, but man, talk about a swing of the pendilum in the opposite direction. <br />

As a druid I really don't mind not seeing any on there, but it would be nice to see a bit more variety. It was frustrating playing a boomkin all the prior seasons and getting told I should have a really high rating cause I was a druid. My ratings weren't bad, I was having fun, but it was like &quot;werz your shoulders dud&quot;. I'd have a lot more fun in arenas if the gear went back to no rating requirements simply so a lot of the epeening going on when subside a little. Some classes and specs just don't really work well for arenas. I'm ok with that since when it comes to 1 v 1, bgs, and world pvp I seem to do alright, and hope the same for other classes. I fear for a day that they add ratings into battlegrounds because then folks won't play with their friends even more, and some poor guy gets left behind just because he's spec'd PvE or just hit max level.</div></div><hr />

Lets check out the top 13 team from each faction (btw only 13 teams are Horde out of the top 100 so thats why i chose the strange number of 13). Only counted the 3 players on the team with the most games played so 39 total.<br />
<br />
Horde Race Breakdown:<br />
Undead: 33 <br />
Tauren: 5<br />
Blood Elf: 1<br />
<br />
Only Non Undead players were Pallies (the only BE), Shaman (4), or Druid (1).<br />
So that means that every class that can be should be UD. Lets check out Aliance<br />
<br />
Aliance Race Breakdown:<br />
Human: 13<br />
Dwarf: 15<br />
Gnome: 8<br />
Dranie: 3<br />
<br />
This was much more diverse DKs were primarily humans, Locks gnomes, hunters and priests dwarfs with Dranie as shamans.<br />
<br />
So what this indicates that either A) 100% of all good rogues, mages, priests, dks, ect play UD on Horde or B) that UD racial is hands down better than any other faction and should be only opted out of if you have to in the case of Druids, Hunters, Palies<br />
<br />
And for Aliance it indicates that the racials have a much better mix with some classes benifiting more than others IE racial ballance.<br />
<br />
So combine the fact that Aliance racials are more balanced compared to horde racials as must have PvP abilites with the fact that there are 9 times as many aliance teams on the top of the bracket with horde and you come to the conclusion that A) Aliance racials are overpowered compared to there horde equivilants, and B) Horde racials need to be adjusted so WotF is more in line with other Horde racials.<br />
<br />

The sample size is so small really, but it does say something though. <br />
<br />
The sample size isn't that small at all sure the blue posts and included graph only shows top 10 teams but it provides links to the whole Realm raiting page. If you check it youll find out of over 2000 teams that actually competed in the tournement (teams that played more than 10 games and had a +1500 record) youll find the top druid is ranked 52nd (only found 2 out of the top 100 teams) and that there are 0 warriors found in the top 100 shows that druids make up 2/300 or 0.66% of the top 5% Tournement Teams. If someone had the time they could strip this info and make it much more telling from a variety of view points.</div></div><hr />

You're quite right for any NA users who cant follow the link in the blue post (not sure why it didn't work) the team is here: http://eu.wowarmory.com/team-info.xml?r=Arena+Tournament+1&amp;ts=3&amp;t=Improved+Clickz&amp;select=Improved+Clickz<br />
<br />
Didn't know you can play 3v3 with 6 players also there is a Druid in the team too. Even though they have 0 games played I'm sure they were a valuable asset to the team. Moral of the story sure War or Druid can be on a +2.2K team on Arena Realm so long as you are a spectator and watch the DK smash face from the sidelines.<br />
<br />
I also noticed most of the DKs on the Arena realm are Unholy aren't they buffing unholy in 3.1? Even with Shattering Throw don't think wars going to see much action in S6</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's possible that since you get free 80's on the arena realm and your winning money correct? that the American players have leveled more characters and are smart enough to say &quot;hey i know how to play a DK.. but my mains a druid. hmmmmmmmmmm I can choose the OP class which i know how to play or the underpowered one that i know how to play&quot;. <br />
<br />
and what's with the Europe vs America crap? you guys are aware that europe is several countries? I mean we're big but the populations of Europe must be much larger combined than the U.S.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
It's just people being immature; ultimately, it's totally reflecting negatively on their homelands ... <br />

Hehe LOL at druid &amp; warriors. Thats how Hunters have felt for over 4 SEASONS!! And warlocks keep QQing, you are well represented, and i face countless of warlock/pala, warlock/rogue, warlock/dk, warlock/shaman teams at the actualy 2100+ Ratings. And gues what!? They own!<br />
<br />
pala dk are over represented because their simply OP. Hunters are ONLY overepresented cause they actually found out that they can stand a chance now. This goes for European realms only, since Europeans are more openminded about arena then the US FOTM classes.</div></div><hr />

Do you enjoy looking like the typical person who plays a hunter on a daily basis? Just wondering because all of your posts have been unbelievabely biased each time. &quot;Hunters wur bad for 4 seasons waaaaa&quot; no, you weren't. There were hunters at the top you just had to have wait for it....waittttttt for it, skill. Now you can faceroll and TNT people while chain kiting them in frost trap ya, that makes you a really tough class to play man. Toss in a wyvern sting and scatter and any hunter with half a brain can kite all the melee classes endlessly with ease but judging from what you have to say most of the time you dont possess that. Also keep going with the durrrr EU &gt; US argument, it really makes your intellect seem that much higher with your superiority complex issues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hehe, im talking about Hunters in generall m8. Ive always had 2100+ rating in every single season, but you dont have to believe that if you dont want to ;D.<br />
Yes i play Hunter on a daily basis. Have played it when they were nerfed to shit, and now playing it when they are good in arena. I think its funny that classes that were OP before are now totall shit (for most players). <br />
You never have played a Hunter in Arena clearly, since u dont know Hunters have been represented in S1/4 by 5% of all arena playing classes.<br />
Ofc there were some skilled Hunters at the top in S1/4, Like 0.2% of the 5% actually playing Arena. Same goes for Warriors and Druids now, so whats you point with that? You say Hunter is an easy faceroll class, i recommend you try play one.<br />
<br />
And about the US / EU representation. Its funny to see they all prefer Dk/Pala and dont even bother to l2play other classes. Giving Blizzard the impression those other classes dont do well in Arena, while RMP actually totally own DK/Pala/Hunt if they have the least bit of brain and use their countless amount of CC. They are well in range of achieving Gladiator Title, but I dont mind riding that Frostwyrm in their place. Or did that sound like i have a superiority complex issue?</div></div><hr />

Read your last statement before this post and tell me if it didn't sound like a superiority complex, kinda funny how you re-word it to sound otherwise now. And i've played arenas since S1 and played a hunter in arena, in S3-4 as marks you were unkillable/did very little damage due to melee actually *gasp* being able to hit you on the other hand vs a lot of things due to lawl scatter trap but paired with the thing you seem to hate oh so much, a druid, carried you up to the top and countered priests like they were a joke like you still continue to do. Please tell me disengaging while someone's stuck in a frost trap OH DAMN LNL PROC explosive explosive aimed scatter/wyvern healer win is hard cus i'd really, really love to know. Oh lets not forget if you get in trouble too you have a 5 second immunity also! woo...not a complete faceroll class at all, everything you can do nearly untouched(especially if you're a dwarf guhhh) all the while doing the whole jumping for no reason deal you all seem to love to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What class do you play atm!? Really lol :D probably a warrior, or another melee. 5 sec immunity!? learn to play.. or just read the ability. Here i looked it up for ya.<br />
<br />
Deterrence:<br />
When activated, increases parry chance by 100% and grants a 100% chance to deflect spells cast by targets in front of you. While Deterrence is active, you cannot attack. Lasts 5 sec, and requires a melee weapon. 5 min CD.<br />
<br />
Rogues disarm, and gone is ur immunity. Also they fight a Hunter from behind, so enjoy and watch the show.<br />
Warriors disarm, gone is ur immunity.<br />
Paladin seals, do not get deflected.<br />
Hunters ranged attacks, do not get deflected.<br />
Dots, bleeds, curses, poisens do not get deflected. So gg warlocks/shadow priests.<br />
<br />
So yes, its a really nice ability if you want to completly disable yourself from doing anything in an Arena match. Deterrence is a very situational ability vs some classes like mage/warrior/feral druid, and in some rare cases vs bad skilled rogues. But other then that.. not so good.<br />
<br />
Also, ive never played with a druid in S1/4 due to the insane long fights, and eventually lose. Ive always prefered to play with a disc priest in 2v2 (yes mana drain team). But Druid/Warrior owned that combo since Druids cant be drained (if he plays well). Besides that ive always been BM in Arena, and used more then 4 buttons to get 2.1k ratings. Mainly because i dont like being hamstringed 95% of the match trying to kill the los abusing shadowmelding nelf druids. And atm i play with a resto shaman.<br />
<br />
You have just spoken as a true melee class player that wants to rolfstomp down everything in ur plate and 30k hp, spamming ur hamstrings or frost chains or whatever spammeble CC u have in ur arsenal. You dont like the fact Hunters have ways to get out of Melee, so you have to waste your 3 forms of charge to keep continue with the hamstring spamming. Because that clearly takes skill! :-X</div></div><hr />

Actually sweetheart I play a rogue(yes I know we were on top for a while) and anything a hunters paired with can cleanse my poisons off and any hunter worth a damn knows how to keep me in front of them, especially when i'm caught in the permaslow. Again any hunter worth a damn is going to have weapon chains to counteract us, 5 second disarm oh noes, FD disengage to still fall back on, warlocks have one damaging curse that does no damage at the start of it as for your deterrence, the dots presently on you still stay on you what do you expect those to fall off too lol :P. So then that leaves hah, just your own class that counters it! funny how that works out. I despise the plate classes too anyways so i'll agree with you on that, having retarded amounts of hp, still doing as much/more damage than me and having the skillz of RNG reliance is funnn. Also hunter shaman is extremely ghey atm too(top team on my BG) :X<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh forgot something my class can vanish CS you in deterrance but if you let me even do that in the first place well...that's your fail then :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes warlocks and shadow priests only use 1 dot on me, well thought. And paladin seals indeed dont kill me in deterrence.. not to mention Dk curses. <br />
To be really quite honest with you, Rogue/Mage, Rogue/Priest and Rogue/Warlock truly owns a Hunter/Shaman setup.<br />
<br />
I will tell you how it goes:<br />
I enter Arena.. hmm a mage and stealthed player, gues its a rogue? Hunter: Quick put pet on the mage before anyone of us get sap! *puts pet on mage, absorb absord absord.<br />
Shaman: im sapped! Hunter: flare, spots Rogue. Mage/Rogue: Frost nova, Stunlock, 22k hp goes to ~8k hp in 4 seconds.<br />
Shaman: still sapped! Only 2 more seconds! Hunter: shit i dont have 2 more seconds! Rogue: Kidney shot. Hunter: trinket, deterrence, trap, disengage, *kites backwards. (meanwhile done 0 dmg).<br />
Mage: Blink, frostnova. Hunter: &gt;:(<br />
Shaman: Im free! Instant heal 1x yey 6k crit! Rogue: BLIND! Shaman: Trinket!<br />
Mage: Sheep, Sheep, Sheep, CS. Hunter: FFS cant do SHIT! Stunlocked, Disarmed, Iceblocked, dead. GG. Shaman: bleh! Hunter: Looks at DPS done.. and sighs.<br />
<br />
Btw im ranked 47th in my BG atm, and rogues do actually own me 75% of the time. The reason i got this high is because Hunter/Shaman roflstomp DK/Pala and Hunter/Pala wich are the over represented combo. Lets just agree on the fact we both hate plate combined with insane dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
TRUTH!<br />
<br />
Only way to make it an Esport would be to make it so only mirror teams would face one annother. Once every +2000 team in DK / Paly / Lock and they all have top PVP set then we have acheved the desired goal. To bad playing the same set up over and over again is no fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And pally's might drop a little due to the lolshield (SS) nerf in 3.1.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
don't forget that mana use for lb is greatly increased</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your tears taste good, after years of having the worst track-record, Paladins are finally viable.<br />
<br />
QQ more, umm, tasty tears!</div></div><hr />
