Warlords of Draenor Item Stats<br />
Depends on if you are a class that benefits from all stats, some don't... and wish to reforge the bad stat.<br />
Truly bad stats (and they do exist) are on us to fix. When one stat is 5% better and still considered mandatory = tough to fix. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407621664751378432))<br />
Miss a break point by few hundred haste? Stuck with wasted stats until perfectly itemized piece drops. Back to BIS lists.<br />
&quot;Miss a break point by a few hundred haste&quot; and &quot;wasted stats&quot; implies a level of min-maxing not necessary for almost all players. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407927962176999424))<br />
Barely missing a break point? That's a rounding error for most of us overcome by better use of abilities and movement in a fight. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407928377341788160))<br />
haste breakpoints for DoTs and HoTs are important. missing by 1 point means 1 less tick, and they are noticable.<br />
There won't be break points on hots and dots any longer. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408258516894240769))<br />
does this mean haste will increase the duration? instead of reducing time between ticks<br />
Haste will increase the number of ticks, possibly resulting in a final fractional tick. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408355005985353728))<br />
<br />
Please keep Reforging in. Now that hit and exp are gone, I don't see the reason for it to be removed.<br />
It would mean you still have to reforge everything to your best secondary stat according to someone's website. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407314304807870464))<br />
Reforging being gone won't stop min-max-ers to min-max their characters, at all. It will stop players defining their style. <br />
I find that a bit contradictory. Whose style is it to do less damage by reforging into the wrong stat? (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407620076800446464))<br />
It is probably possible to get secondary stats closer, but not possible to get them all within 1% of each other in all fights (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407620223030657024))<br />
Maybe they meant: &quot;want secondary stats to affect play style, not dps&quot;. Would be cool (hard as hell) to do that<br />
Yeah it's hard because there will always be a mathematically-solvable right answer for DPS. Not so for tanks and healers. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408669258873204736))<br />
We try to get around that by varying the situations a lot. Some fights need burst. Others need AE. Others need movement. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408669379098705921))<br />
My dream: lots of abilities for dps, you pick and choose what your rotation uses due to what stat you favor. works in theory?<br />
In theory. Might mean balancing a whole lot of different potential rotations. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408752399587614720))<br />
<br />
It would mean you COULD reforge everything. You're taking AWAY choice. Now, a crappy piece of gear is a dud.<br />
It's not really a &quot;choice&quot; though when the choice is play more effectively (reforge) or less effectively (be lazy). (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/407322748361256962))<br />
a statment like that caterning for the people that dont give a shit about playing the game is a ..<br />
I think you misinterpreted the statement. I was arguing reforging isn't really a choice because most players don't want to be bad. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408257505664331777))<br />
(They may be bad anyway, but they likely aren't trying to be bad.) (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408257611872477184))<br />
<br />
Bringing back AP/SP is a bad idea. since stacking Agi/Str/Int we get even more from the 5% buff. Plz, dont hate us.<br />
That is solveable. The idea is to make sure jewelry etc. can be shared more easily, particularly between Str and Agi users. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408665514341179392))<br />
Another idea is rings swap Str and Agi (but not Int) the way armor does or something similar. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408665596226592768))<br />
if I'm getting this right. There will be no primary stat on non-armor pieces?<br />
Possibly on weapons, just because weapons are fairly iconic and don't have as much class overlaps as say rings can. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408688089448452096))<br />
Obviously, this is all stuff that's in flux as &quot;we&quot; work through it all. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408688154724401152))<br />
<br />
The post doesn't make this clear, but are they getting rid of Tier tokens?<br />
We haven't decided. There is still some benefit in dropping paly-priest-warlock instead of just warlock. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405460952700559360))<br />
<br />
Tertiary Stats<br />
New loot system will make loot distribution a PITA. I'm not looking forward to dealing with more loot related drama.<br />
Overall we find sharing fewer items to be better for morale even if the pieces that do drop are highly coveted. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405460586936274944))<br />
I meant &quot;Overall we find SHARDING fewer....&quot; That changes the whole context. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405460796815065089))<br />
<br />
Think tertiary stats dramas organized raids? Chest drops, give to tank. +lifesteal chest drops, give to tank again. 1st wasted<br />
That will happen on rare occasions. But what if a chest drops with Lifesteal but a secondary the tank doesn't like, say crit? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402649275869306880))<br />
My point is that overall the landscape will have more answers than just &quot;Is it BiS? If not, pass.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402649412523929600))<br />
<br />
Ridiculously powerful items being very rare and random like D3, w/o the ability to grind for these as much as you want. Why?<br />
We want the long tail to be exciting. Otherwise you earn BiS quickly and shard everything else for weeks. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405459699119570945))<br />
<br />
Why does WoD loot seem like Diablo loot system with a 1 week lockout and huge party requirement?<br />
It's not nearly as random as Diablo. We just want to keep that 14th Immerseus kill somewhat exciting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405462038899470336))<br />
Lots of people will not see that as something cool or amazing dropping. To them it will feel like the other drops are shit.<br />
Then they're going to go weeks and weeks without a new item if they pass everything that isn't BiS. MC loot style wasn't that bad. (Source (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/408663364684890112))<br />
<br />
If Tertiary stats aren't 'common enough to build a set around', then where's the gameplay? Who cares about +0.74% run speed.<br />
Since we don't have to balance around the case of a run speed set, we should be able to make the effects much larger than 0.74%. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405458496230940672))<br />
Run speed might be a bit too BiS for casters as a tert. stat dont you think?<br />
Run speed will still be pretty rare and on some fights it's totally useless. Seems like a fine position for it overall. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/405464304134017025))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
New GPUs from AMD are here, at least on paper. Finding any AMD GPUs is hard now, as is finding some of the Nvidia GPUs. Prices for many GPUs went up due to demand and the older GPUs being discontinued. <br />
<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2013/december/ssdgraph.gif) are stable, with most SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
The Haswell CPUs (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A) or H90 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00B4OCWDE?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B00B4OCWDE). <br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

You turned off account wide achievements in game then most likely. People that did that aren't included.</div></div><hr />

The highest character per account. I don't think account total is used / calculated anywhere on armory is it?</div></div><hr />

I see what you are saying. We use the achievement points listed on the character page, not the guild one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, so some background. I didn't play MoP. I quit at the end of Cata (June). I quit because I was burnt out. I don't think anything will bring me back to the game, but I have been following the WoD info to see what the new expansion is going to hold. <br />
<br />
This statement right here, is terrible. <br />
<br />
I raided DS full clears + Raid Finder from the time it opened, until I left. We left DS not fully cleared MAYBE a handful of times. I had over 220 Qualifying kills on bosses that could drop a stupid trinket that was BiS for my build. I never saw it, even to lose it. That wasn't fun. They tried the &quot;make stuff super rare, so that it doesn't drop often&quot;, and it failed. It failed in Firelands. It failed in Dragon Soul. It wasn't fun, when you were that poor schmuck who raided and raided and raided and raided and raided and never saw the loot drop because it was &quot;supposed to be special&quot; <br />
<br />
So far? I'll stick with Path of Exile, and not bother coming back to WoW. the new ideas for secondary stats, removal of reforging, and silly new stats just don't even remotely sound interesting. If I want bad tertiary stats, I'll stick to a game like PoE, and my Increased Light Radius, and not worry about paying for a game.</div></div><hr />

- It's not nearly as random as Diablo. We just want to keep that 14th Immerseus kill somewhat exciting.<br />
<br />
Alright who in the hell wants to kill the same boss 14 times just to get one piece of loot? I've been in some guilds that raid and full clear for months and months and there is already that one piece that never seems to drop and some ppl go without getting any loot for 3-4 weeks in a row. For a game that is about &quot;getting loot to improve your character&quot; you figure they would want to make it easier not harder. If the stats on gear are going to be so random then you could see let's say a bracer that has crit/run speed then maybe another one with mastery/crit and continue to see these same stats over and over when all you want is haste on that piece. Without reforge there wont be a way to add haste to it so you're still going to be out a piece of gear until it eventually drops (most likely when you are burnt out and tired of playing the same old raid)<br />
<br />
&quot;Lots of people will not see that as something cool or amazing dropping. To them it will feel like the other drops are shit.&quot;<br />
- Then they're going to go weeks and weeks without a new item if they pass everything that isn't BiS. MC loot style wasn't that bad. <br />
<br />
LOL WUT? If you are looking to fit a certain set of stats with the gear setup you're going for and they never drop how is that better? This is like saying that we should just take whatever BS drops until something good or desired drops. THAT IS NOT FUN! I don't wanna eat shit until someone makes me a pancake...... Who the hell is making these decisions at blizzard? MC loot was aweful and having to share 3 things with 40 ppl??? lol If it wasn't for dkp I would have never got anything back then and even raiding for months and months I'm pretty sure I only upgraded 3-4 things from MC before BWL came out. Unfortunately the guild i was in wasn't able to step up and kill bosses in BWL so my raiding got cut short until BC. <br />
<br />
Basically unless they have a lot of trash loot dropping off of random mobs in raids, we're not gonna see much useful gear unless we get lucky. (why does this sound like diablo loot?!?!?!?!?)</div></div><hr />

yeah that BiS point GC is trying to make is a bit BS. Right now it is an okay piece that players reforge on their path to BiS and the WoD system which is BiS excluding random &quot;bonus&quot; stats. What it sounds more like is Blizzard is bringing in the new system which will for the most part make gearing up faster while keeping the &quot;tail&quot; end of the gearing still long for those that care about the extra edge. With the armor pieces being the same there might overall be more variety of stat combinations which in turn means less likely to not have a shitty piece as the only piece available. Gear competition is already going to increase and reforging is going to be an extra edge on the competition. Seems Blizzard wants players who think pretty good is good enough to gear up fast just not too fast while at the same time relieve the increased gear competition issue they introduced.<br />
<br />
I like reforging and want it to stay as I would rather reforge my gear to try another spec than carry and collect another set just to play another spec without such a large hit. I feel like Blizzard is trying to resolve some issues by introducing new issues. Some of their goals might be a bit too greedy. Hit and expertise is gone so a new piece of gear is not as large of a hit making higher ilvl pieces more likely to be an upgrade as is. The developers talk about it being hard to remove features from players and yet find it trivial to remove reforging is kind of screwed up.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
For myself I dont see it good on player psychology for someone to get a piece the week before only to see someone else get the same piece but with a bonus the week after. If the intent is to make players feel good about their drops then why make players feel reluctant over getting a piece now or have them think about waiting for next time?<br />
<br />
It is also shitty to get used to a bonus like a cleave or a run speed and then get a gear upgrade and lose that extra visual of a cleave or feel slower than what was normal prior to the gear upgrade. I dont mind losing things like tier set bonus which can change gameplay as the choice is a bit more static and expected usually coming at a point where it is replaced with another tier set bonus. Getting random bonuses at such a rarity along with loot competition does not seem fun to me.</div></div><hr />

Reforging in my opinion seems like a necessary standard in this game now, especially in WoD with the extra RNG that will accompany the new stat changes. Reforging helps lessen the feeling that you've been bent over and oiled up by the RNG gods.</div></div><hr />

That's not the point. The point is you have to kill that boss the 14th time anyway if the end boss is still on farm (which after 14 weeks, it might very well be). And when you do, and it drops something that's a (possibly minor) upgrade to someone, it won't be a complete waste of time.</div></div><hr />

I think Blizz has realised that the gear enhancement game has gone too far. If a piece of gear drops, you need to upgrade/upgrade/gem/enchant/reforge/transmog before you put it on. They want to cut down on some of those steps. Transmog is well liked and won't go away; enchanting and gemming still need to be around to give those professions a purpose. Upgrading might be on the chopping block but it does help get rid of the problem of high-level raiders having no real use for their currency. Reforging OTOH is thoroughly uninteresting considering that most people will either use a bot, or learn from the internet what their approximate best stats are.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My dream: lots of abilities for dps, you pick and choose what your rotation uses due to what stat you favor. works in theory?<br />
This would be kind of cool, but it also would serve to eliminate what few remaining defining elements of each class/spec are left: Fire is the 'crit' mage, for example. They need to keep things a little bit separate other that just the colour of the fireballs you throw.<br />
<br />
<br />
With the tertiary stats, I think a lot of the time people aren't going to care that much. Encounters will most likely still be balanced for 0 +speed. How often will you really need +lifesteal as a mage when you have a perfectly capable healer waiting on you? Tanks will love it, but I can't imagine anyone else 'needing' it. <br />

[quote]Miss a break point by few hundred haste? Stuck with wasted stats until perfectly itemized piece drops. Back to BIS lists.<br />
&quot;Miss a break point by a few hundred haste&quot; and &quot;wasted stats&quot; implies a level of min-maxing not necessary for almost all players. (Source)<br />
Barely missing a break point? That's a rounding error for most of us overcome by better use of abilities and movement in a fight/quote]<br />
<br />
I think some people are taking this a bit out of context. For the majority of players, the ones doing normal modes, you're going to get a much bigger difference just based on your latency or movement than you will getting up to the next haste point. I mean, look at your 'theoretical maximum' dps on whatever sim tool you use and see how well you actually compare. Only a handful of players will be within small enough margins of that number for their haste caps to make a real difference to them anyway. And, blizz is just going to remove that problem by giving an extra 95% tic if you're 5% away from the next cap. Great!</div></div><hr />

How is it 'punishing' players? It's removing a lot of the &quot;&quot; hard work &quot;&quot; which required you to meticulously study your class and be intimately familiar with game mechanics ask Mr Robot when you got a new piece of gear. Everyone will be on the new level playing field of no reforging, so it won't be like you're at a disadvantage. It might even mean that you have more access to better gear, as you won't have other players wanting your piece as an 'upgrade' because they can reforge hit to haste.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has made a habit of removing the reliance on 3rd party tools which have become mandatory to support gameplay. Things like the Dungeon Journal, Quest Tracker, recognition of iLevels, weren't supported previously in the game until addons or tabbing out of wow to check wowhead became too common. Reforging is in the area of not really reflecting any 'skill' on the player's part - merely same area. Min-maxers aren't displaying any kind of skill or knowledge of the game by Asking Mr Robot to do their reforging. It just adds another step on to acquisition of gear.</div></div><hr />

People with several alts and high achievement point counts skew the curve otherwise. Everyone has almost the same amount of achievement points on all of their level 90 characters, so this way I am just counting one character per account.<br />

<br />
The H100i is $50 more than the NH-D14, runs louder, and runs only a few degrees cooler. Not worth the money or noise if you don't need the different form factor. <br />
<br />
<br />
Who picks a 280x or 770 for unicorn? If you are already spending that much get a 290x or 780 TI. <br />
<br />
Those are the GPUs that fit at that price range. If the price for that system was $200 more, those GPUs would fit. For most of the current games, the 280x is enough to run at max or nearly max settings at 1920x1080.</div></div><hr />

The problem being a bland loot system that WILL create loot drama. The loot system they are offering us only caters to disorganized/PUG groups. For guilds that use EPGP or Suicide Kings or even loot council they are screwed because the guild leadership or the players have to decide if they want to spend accumulated points or decide who is more worthy for beneficial tertiary stat. This random good third stat is only even mildly appealing to someone playing a solo game like diablo not a group game like World of Warcraft. I think the no reforge idea is terrible also since it means EVERYONE will play exactly the same, since they have to accumulate the BIS list from some secondary website, instead of reforging the gear from suggestions from a secondary website. Does their argument even make sense on why they are changing it. When they say that people go to Websites and copy the same reforges, that is true to a point, but rarely if ever does someone have ALL the BiS gear for their toon. Players do work their character to the same goal, but they don't use the same reforges. Do you think the Holy Priest from Paragon could have solo healed that fight without reforging?

Not worth the money or noise if you don't need the different form factor.<br />
<br />
Ok but what about the H55? $50 and it's a closed loop watercooling that works amazingly well. IMO The H55 is way better than the Thermaltake Frio and $12 less.<br />

I would like to also note that the H100i is $111 which is $31 more.<br />

Runs slightly warmer, has a pump that was noisy in the H50 version (not sure if H55 fixed it), and still has the risk of leaks. Not worth it.</div></div><hr />

Leaks aren't very likely unless you're physically rough with it. I'd be more worried about the pump dying. However, fans die as well.</div></div><hr />

With the removal of hit,expertise,parry, and dodge it really makes reforging something that will only be done by min-maxers or peeps playing around with different ideas. If your unlucky with the stats on drops atleast you have a way to try and counter that.<br />
<br />
Agree completely. To me, without exp/hit, reforging is a fun thing where we can cater to our playstyles. I know this isn´t the norm, but on my alts, and even on my off-spec for main, I rarely reforge based on some website... I reforge based on how I want to play that role. Doing LFR as a disc-atone priest is vastly different than doing progression raiding.<br />
<br />
The devs are being blinded by the whole Min-Max argument and failing to realize there is a lot of gameplay to reforging for other types of players.</div></div><hr />

They are trying to make those haste breakpoints small enough that you won't do this. They are also trying to make it so that you will take a higher ilevel item if it doesn't have the bonus stat over one that does. I'm sure they can manage that across tiers, but probably not at the same difficulty. In that, Normal -&gt; Heroic might be small enough that an item with bonus armor (for a tank) on normal will be better than one without it on heroic.</div></div><hr />

*sighs* Go find a dictionary. Look up what the word 'sample' means. Particularly when taking a sample to reflect statistical data.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dislike rng deciding how much dps I'll be doing (loot drops) compared to a &quot;twin&quot; player getting nice drops, and prefer they kept reforging in the game... expanded it even.<br />
<br />
u gave example of fire mage - now imagine that ur playing fire and for few weeks/months only loot that is droping will be mastery/haste combo - how long will it take before u change spec cause all the loot u could possibly get will be utterly usless for ur spec ? with reforge u could at least be very weak fire mage without it ull be &quot;just&quot; forced to reroll to other spec untill rng will start droping u crit gear -_- fun design indeed -_-</div></div><hr />

<br />
? How many people are going to know/care that much about gear to reforge slightly but still accept being 'weak' at their spec?<br />
<br />
The way I see that scenario playing out is more like:<br />
a) Haste/Mastery items drop, you don't know/care enough about what your 'optimal' stats are, so you equip them<br />
b) Haste/mastery items drop, you care enough about being an optimal player that you re-spec.<br />
c) You have mostly crit gear on but can't get a crit piece for a particular slot. With or without reforging, that piece is suboptimal and you will replace it at the first chance you get.<br />
<br />
Its not exactly as though re-speccing is difficult, time-consuming or expensive anymore... Pretty much every player will have 2 out of 3 specs covered anyway.</div></div><hr />

if a player would really give such impression or answear to his rl then he has no place anywhere besides lfr in organized group runs -_- unless u are happy with doin only lfr then sure this system will be soooo awesom for such players.</div></div><hr />

So I guess people still don't realize that the secondary stats of items will be fixed?<br />
<br />
It's the warforged attribute, sockets and tertiary stats like running speed that will be RNG-governed.</div></div><hr />
