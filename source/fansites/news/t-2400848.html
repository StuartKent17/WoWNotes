Raid Testing Schedule - Jun 1st - 4th<br />
On Friday, June 1st, we will be conducting a Mythic Uldir raid test for Mythrax. After mythic testing has ended, the first wing of Raid Finder Uldir will be available through the weekend.<br />
<br />
Friday, June 1st<br />
<br />
Mythrax - Mythic Uldir - 13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
Friday, June 1st - Monday, June 4th<br />
<br />
Halls of Containment - Raid Finder Uldir - 14:30 PDT (17:30 EDT, 23:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a Beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
A: In Zuldazar, Boralus, Dalaran, Orgrimmar, or Stormwind, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade III in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br />
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 120 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested. <br />
<br />
Q: How long does testing last?<br />
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.<br />

Marksmanship Hunter Feedback - Battle for Azeroth<br />
Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
I wanted to post a few things about Marksmanship, including a few things in the works.<br />
<br />
Lone Wolf's damage at 10% may not be the final number. I changed it from 18% to 10% a while back so it being at 18% and such a big DPS swing between pet and no pet would stop dominating the conversation about Lone Wolf. Tuning will happen.<br />
<br />
Aimed Shot's charge recovery time will be reduced by haste in a future build.<br />
<br />
Rapid Fire's visual effects are not final. <br />
Rapid Fire will bounce to 1 additional target when Trick Shots is active in a future build.<br />
<br />
Sniper Training (Mastery) will be changed to affect all of your shots instead of only Focus spending shots in a future build so things like Rapid Fire are not left behind as gear progresses. <br />
<br />
RNG - there's a lot of talents with randomness in them. We hear the feedback that you feel things are too random. Some things will probably change to be less random in general, others will have some adjustments made to how they proc to prevent the really bad luck streaks from being a thing. <br />
<br />
As always, thanks for the feedback both in this thread and others created.<br />
<br />
<br />
End of Legion PvP Experience Feedback<br />
To mirror the PvE post where Blizzard is asking about Mythic+, I thought it would be constructive to start a discussion with respect to our PvP experience during this expansion.<br />
There will be one for PvP!<br />
<br />
I have a list that we're going down. We don't have a set order at the moment but PvP will be coming up!<br />
<br />
<br />
Fury Warrior Feedback - Battle for Azeroth<br />
We’ve been iterating on Fury Warrior since last week, and the next Beta build will again be a slightly out-of-date version of Fury compared to we have internally at this moment.<br />
<br />
To give an update: everything on the baseline spec described last week hasn’t changed. However, many talents have been adjusted, moved, or replaced to better fit together with the updates to the Fury spec.<br />
<br />
Level 15, 30, 60 rows: No changes since last week/last Beta build.<br />
<br />
Level 45 row: Inner Rage, Sudden Death, Furious Slash – this row speed up/adds to the rotation<br />
<br />
Inner Rage is now -1 sec off the base cooldown of Raging Blow (which is now 8 sec base cooldown) and increases its damage. Simple and direct, and does the job of slightly speeding up/adding to the rotation.<br />
<br />
Sudden Death is the same talent many know, adjusted for Fury – “Your attacks have a chance to reset the cooldown of Execute and make it usable on any target, regardless of their health.” It replaces Wrecking Ball in the talent tree, and fills the role of “occasionally inserts an ability into your rotation” better than Wrecking Ball does, because Whirlwind is now already used often as part of your single-target rotation. Additionally, now that Execute generates 20 Rage for Fury, this proc will also serve to slightly speed up the rotation, which is desirable on this talent row.<br />
<br />
Furious Slash is the Furious Slash attack (from live) combined with Frenzy (the talent from live), as described last week, granting Haste per stack, stacking up to 3. It serves as the higher-complexity talent that add a brand new button to your rotation. The Haste granted has been reduced to a more appropriate level (2% per stack, pending playtesting/feedback/tuning) considering the spec now has 25% Haste baseline from Enrage, and with another talent (Frothing Berserker) also providing 10% Haste occasionally.<br />
<br />
Level 75 row: Carnage, Massacre, Frothing Berserker<br />
<br />
Massacre has been redesigned into “Execute is now usable on targets below 35% health”. Now that Execute has a cooldown and generates Rage, the live Legion version doesn’t make much sense anymore – it would've just amounted to a Rage proc on Execute. Additionally, Execute adds a significant amount to the rotation already when it's available – any redesign that made that Execute window even more impacted by adding more resources or buttons to press didn’t seem to overall improve the Execute rotation. Instead, widening the window during which you can use Execute, made more sense.<br />
<br />
On Execute’s cooldown, which is currently 6 sec (reduced by Haste, ending up at ~4.2 sec with Enrage up): Currently, there are no lack of buttons to press during Execute windows, with Execute being available on every 4th ability use (at a high priority), and pushing some other buttons out to make room for itself. We think Execute being any lower cooldown makes the Fury rotation more cramped during Execute, and not any better overall.<br />
<br />
Carnage and Frothing Berserker are unchanged since last week.<br />
<br />
Level 90 row: Meat Cleaver, Dragon Roar, Bladestorm – this row is primarily AOE<br />
<br />
Whirlwind still has its baseline mechanic of making your next 2 attacks strike up to 4 additional targets for 40% damage (this mechanic/buff is called Meat Cleaver on live). That proc/buff has been renamed to simply “Whirlwind” because if anyone referred to Meat Cleaver when talking about Fury, it wasn’t possible to find those words anywhere in the spellbook, which made it harder to learn about the mechanic. Meat Cleaver, the new talent, uses that name, and gives Whirlwind a 10% chance to Enrage you and causes it to generate an additional 1 Rage per target hit (up to 3 additional Rage), pending tuning.<br />
<br />
Dragon Roar’s cooldown has been increased to 40 sec (up from 25 sec), radius has been increased to 12 yds (up from 8 yds), damage increased significantly, and it now generates 10 Rage. The goal is to put it much closer to Odyn’s Fury in usage and damage impact (high cooldown, more one-hit damage). Generating a respectable amount of Rage allows it to be used during Recklessness without you feeling like you’re missing out on its potential Rage generation increase.<br />
<br />
Bladestorm’s duration has been reduced to 3 sec (down from 6 sec), cooldown reduced to 1 min (down from 1.5 min), and now generates 20 Rage over the duration. Shortening the duration allows Bladestorm to fit into an Enrage window (without requiring extreme amounts of Haste) if used right after after gaining Enrage, and a shorter duration/cooldown Bladestorm feels more like Fury anyways.<br />
<br />
Level 100 row: Reckless Abandon, Anger Management, Siegebreaker – this row modifies or adds damage bonuses<br />
<br />
Reckless Abandon is a fine talent, no changes. <br />
<br />
Anger Management has been added to Fury, reducing the cooldown of Recklessness by 1 sec for every 25 Rage you spend. Recklessness is cool, so why not have it more often?<br />
<br />
When looking at the third talent slot on this row, we tried various version of Bloodbath or Avatar at different cooldowns, or with different mechanics, or with up-front damage, and even a version where the talent literally just cast both Avatar and Recklessness for 15 sec with a 1.5-2 min CD. In the end we concluded:<br />
<br />
<br />
Any version that was a separate self-buff damage cooldown button didn’t feel great to press consecutively with Recklessness, because you’re pressing two straight abilities which both feel more like self-buffs than attacks<br />
Any version that made Recklessness stronger (high damage/amplitude) or replaced Recklessness with an ability with a 1.5 min cooldown, felt too similar to Reckless Abandon<br />
Any version that made Recklessness shorter cooldown was Anger Management<br />
Any version that made Recklessness a longer cooldown or replaced it with a new spell with a longer cooldown, didn’t feel great because you were taking a talent that made Recklessness available less oftenIn the end, we’re going to try a cooldown attack that debuffs the target, increasing your damage done to them for a duration. This synergizes with Recklessness in a way that feels better – Recklessness first to buff yourself, then a heavy attack against the enemy. The intended gameplay is: Build up Rage -&gt; Siegebreaker -&gt; Rampage -&gt; Rebuild Rage -&gt; Rampage before Siegebreaker ends. Correct tuning on the duration will allow 2 Rampages to be doable during one Siegebreaker, but not trivial to do mindlessly. During Recklessness you should be able to get off three Rampages in the Siegebreaker window. <br />
<br />
<br />
Siegebreaker (30 sec cooldown, Generates 15 Rage): Break the enemy’s defenses, dealing [120% AP] Physical damage, and increasing your damage done to the target by 20% for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
<br />
Outburst, Bloodbath, and Avatar have been removed from Fury. Auto attack damage, as a portion of your overall damage, has been reduced. This came from increasing the damage of most abilities on the spec. Our target for auto attack damage on Fury is currently much closer to 25% of your overall damage than 50%.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the continued feedback here and everywhere else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thy should make lone wolf standard... MM shoudl not be able to use a pet. Then, and only then, they dont need to worry about balancing. Hunters who wnat pets should play BM</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lone Wolf is baseline for MM in BfA. Basically you only have the pet for utility, and the tuning is just to be higher dps than playing with a pet. Will come down to Utility vs DPS in the end.</div></div><hr />
