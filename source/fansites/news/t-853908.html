No matter what style of play you prefer, we want to equip you with the tools and knowledge you need to protect yourself against account compromise. To help get you started, below you'll find a series of tips and suggestions aimed at improving your account and computer security. <br />
<br />
Since we’ve been encouraging account security awareness for quite a while now, you might have already run across some of this information on our Account Security Awareness page, in one of our support articles, or posted by your fellow players here on these forums. We want to make sure that as many players as possible have secure accounts, though, so we encourage you to take some time to read over this refresher, make sure your account is secure, and share these tips and resources with your friends and guildmates, too.<br />

Trade Secrets of a Trade Prince -- Leaders of the Horde and Alliance, Part 3<br />
King Varian Wrynn, Queen Sylvanas Windrunner, King Genn Greymane, and Trade Prince Gallywix -- these are just a few of the leaders who continue to shape Azeroth's destiny. They embody their races' strongest traits... and at times their greatest failings. The Leaders of the Horde and Alliance is a series of short stories from Blizzard Entertainment that peer into the hearts of these legendary heroes and offer insight into what new trials might lie ahead as they lead their people in a world forever changed by the Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
&quot;Trade Secrets of a Trade Prince,&quot; (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/leader-story/gallywix/1)the third story in this series (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/%20), takes us on a journey into the mind of Gallywix, one of the goblins' most exceptionally shrewd movers and shakers. Becoming a Trade Prince doesn't just happen overnight, and you certainly don't get your likeness carved into the side of a mountain by letting others push you around and take what's yours.<br />
<br />
So read on and learn the tricks of the trade that led Gallywix to untold fortune and success, and maybe one day you, too, can be a powerful and renowned goblin just like him.<br />
<br />
Ha. Right.<br />

Capital cities NPC Equalization in 4.1<br />
We're doing a full NPC equalization in the next major patch to ensure each capital city has the same tradeskill, trainer, and supply resources. Hopefully to ensure that any city can be visited for the majority of uses.<br />
<br />
We don't have any plans though to extend the dailies and portals in Stormwind and Orgrimmar to the other cities. They were specifically chosen as the main capital hubs for Cataclysm, and as such a lot of work went into updating and improving them knowing they would be the primary hubs, including new and redesigned areas for the dailies and portal hub.<br />
<br />
In the same way that Dalaran or Shattrath were the main cities for their expansions, and housed unique quests and services, Stormwind and Orgrimmar are the main cities for Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/159047/we-need-more-than-one-major-city-please))<br />

Vote kick abuse penalty<br />
2. There is an incentive not to take pugs for that last spot or two because of the stiff penalties I have to face if they are bads.<br />
You're exaggerating the penalty quite a bit. The penalty for issuing Vote Kicks too often is hidden from you and is issued in almost all cases when players are way too trigger happy with this option.<br />
<br />
Yes, you could be in a dungeon with three other friends and pick up a bad player. You could get two bad players in a row. Maybe more. The penalty still shouldn't really apply to you unless you're kicking player after player on a whim because you and your friends get absolute say over whether that fifth player gets to stay in your group or not.<br />
<br />
This change should have little affect on the majority of players running dungeons with three other friends, so long as they're being reasonable about when to use the Vote Kick feature. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/159048/proof-that-tanks-healers-are-special))<br />

Vicious Gladiator's Bonegrinder nerfed model<br />
I'm genuinely sorry to hear that you're disappointed. I hope that, despite being smaller, that your mace will still hit hard enough to have made the purchase worthwhile.<br />
<br />
While it might have been of impressive stature, the previous model for the Vicious Gladiator's Bonegrinder was a bit too large and its size was causing some graphical issues and clipping. While a little clipping is to be expected, in this case it was pretty excessive and needed to be changed.<br />
<br />
By necessity, change happens in World of Warcraft all the time. There's always fine tuning to do and improvements to make, and if there's a bug or other issue at work we'll do our best to fix it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/159033/why-did-you-shrink-my-bonegrinder))<br />
<br />
Feedback on official forums<br />
To some there's a disconnect between what they want, and what we agree is best for the game, or what we're able to deliver at the current time (depending on what we're talking about). We're managing a live game that (ideally) appeals to the millions of people playing who have widely varied interests. You might want a specific class nerfed, a change reverted, some feature added, etc. and we take that feedback, get some info, and hopefully have some kind of response. Most of the time though that response is going to be that we have no current plans to do so, or that we don't agree with the feedback, but hopefully we provide enough info to at least make our case known.<br />
<br />
In addition, there seems to be an expectation that we're going to continue discussing topics we've already made statements on. That we're ignoring the issue because we're not continuing to discuss certain topics beyond our initial response on it. While I agree an open dialog is nice when it can occur, it's generally best for us to relate our thoughts on specific topics, and then watch the feedback that we receive after. Continuing to kick the hornet's nest, as it were, is rarely productive.<br />
<br />
If there are specific questions we haven't gotten to yet, then that's our bad. In some cases we may avoid some topics specifically, or maybe don't feel that it merits a response. In others we maybe just don't have an answer yet. We are in the process of developing some new forms of direct developer communication, though, tied to forum interaction. We're hoping it helps out in some of these areas. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/159038/so-when-is-blizzard-going-to-fix-everything))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..warrior) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1676-Warrior-Cataclysm))<br />
Juggernaut Nerf<br />
2. Why the Nerf seems so harsh.<br />
Warriors had gotten used to having extremely high mobility. Arms warriors were so mobile that kiting wasn't very effective against them, and their uptime was very high as a result. In fact, we'd arrived at a place where melee in general just had too much up-time on casters, especially healers. Conditions were prompting a move toward more instant cast spells and casting on the move, when we wanted to take PvP back to a place where cast time spells could still have a place on the battlefield. We feel this approach introduces more choices in PvP both for the casters and melee in terms of what abilities to use, when to close the gap, when to make space, what to interrupt, etc. Rather than give casters yet more tools to generate breathing space and perpetuate that arms race, it made sense to take a second look at melee mobility instead.<br />
<br />
We understand that you need to be on your target to do your jobs, but it didn’t really make sense to allow close to 100% up time either. On the other hand, we understand that without high up-time warriors might not bring as much to an Arena or Rated Battleground team, and we're adding new utility in a future patch to help address that, though we’re not yet ready to share details.<br />
<br />
Going back to the point though, we didn't want to funnel warriors into speccing into Fury, and that was never the intention. While it would be nice if both specs were equally viable for PvP and PvE, we realize that's a tough goal to meet. On the other hand, if Fury is the best spec for both PvP and PvE and Arms is left with nothing, then that's not a great place to be either.<br />
<br />
As for some general notes, we do think Arms damage is a little low in both PvP and PvE, and we might adjust that soon. This isn't a solution to current PvP viability issues, and we understand that. I'm just mentioning it because we're on the subject of Arms and it's worth noting. While we’re on the subject of stuff ‘worth noting’, we also don’t like jumping to avoid Charge, so we're examining some potential solutions for that too.<br />
<br />
We're not looking at changing the talent trees at the moment, since we’re very happy with both the Arms and Fury trees as well as the results of some of our core mechanics changes, such as normalizing rage, redesigning Heroic Strike and changing stance penalties.<br />
<br />
1. The Usefulness of Heroic Leap.<br />
Heroic Leap involves a lot of movement code, which is among the most challenging things we can do in our engine. We wouldn't have included it if we believed that it was useless, or wasn't usually effective. We think it's a cool ability that does offer greater mobility on the battlefield, even if it isn't as useful specifically for closing with a target as intercept or charge are.<br />
<br />
It doesn't help us, or you, to just say that it's useless or almost never works on the forums. Heroic Leap functionality is something we're actively working to improve, so if you find yourself consistently unable to find a path to the jump target, when you submit a report let us know when it didn't work, where you were, and what you were trying to do. The more specific and detailed you are, the more tools you give us to make your tools work better. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/159118/civil-discussion-juggernaut-nerf))<br />
<br />
State of Warrior Talent Trees<br />
We're happy with the talent trees themselves in terms of their current structure and content. That's not the same as saying we're completely happy with the current state of warriors in general. &quot;Broken&quot; is also an exaggeration that I prefer to avoid, because it occludes more than it reveals.

<br />
which is perfect imo, good warriors should have ~50% uptime. Bad warriors should L2P :). If only every other class had similar 'obvious' discrepancies between the 'good' and the 'bad'.<br />
<br />
In fact, it's what makes playing arms all the more 'fun' atm, as each mobility decision has it's own consequence that become glaringly evident as a match/game progresses. I.e. you get punished for incorrect decisions instead of just 'more-or-less' staying in melee range all the time regardless.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, I do believe we need to be compensated for the mobility nerf somehow, to make us more viable, but that should be via some other sort of CD-based utility buff (a la the wrath overpower mechanic, or something similar), but not an increased dmg/mobility buff.<br />
<br />
I also hope our PvE dmg gets buffed :( *sniff* :D.</div></div><hr />

The only dif between arms and fury was that arms had to change stance to use its 2nd gap closer. Does bliz really expect people to eat this stuff up . Really what was op was at the start of wrath prot warriors was flying around knocking people out and was not able to be rooted. The logic where bliz nerfs warrior is ok guys we dont wanna say we over nerfed warrior so we are going to beat around the bush.

I think you might of double posted this (you can edit posts you know :D)<br />

Your suggestion won't do a single thing to increase account security.<br />
<br />
After a certain number of attempts your account gets locked and goes into a cool down period before you can try again. If Blizzard notices unusual login attempts they would lock your account. A brute force attack won't work as it would take an insanely long amount of time and there's no way Blizzard wouldn't notice a bruce force style attack occuring for a players account.<br />
<br />
So case sensitive passwords wouldn't offer you anything meaningful in terms of increased account security other then a false sense of security.</div></div><hr />

That would take the whole unique feel out of the class but yet again they did rip the heart out already. I for one don't think they will replace it with a movement boost.</div></div><hr />

Yea i know, it was a mistake :)<br />
Anyway, i think case insensitivity makes easier to take a hit within that certain number of attempts. Take the &quot;everyday users&quot; password choice and combine it with a little social engineering skill -&gt; a few attempts could lead to success. I know its not the blizzard fault if the a user takes a password which easy to guess, but i think making the passwords case sensitive isn't a big work (or it is, i don't really know just guessing) , but it can give more protection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rend tics are very small part of the dmg from a arms warrior. Its more of a keep dmg flowing on the target while they are out of your range. <br />
<br />
Deep wounds are not like they use to be. Its like weapon dmg based. Also its only on the target after you crit.<br />
<br />
Over power does not always crit.<br />
<br />
If a warrior gets you to half hp then stuns you thats called a plan of attack you don't trinket it you will proble die if there is no healer.<br />
<br />
Extra dmg procs I think you are talking about Sudden Death? Sudden Death is to help the warrior keep up colossus smash up on the target in pvp and pve.<br />
Over power is a main spell of the warrior they have to set up to even use it via Rend Tics. <br />
<br />
Here is the problem if they wanna make it where a warrior isn't as &quot;mobile&quot; atleast give them them better DoT via rend and impale . Granted it would feel like you are playing a druid or rogue but least getting a few sec on a target to rend . Maybe get a hit on them would be nice after you get that hit and you are just sitting there you see dmg is still being done. <br />
<br />
Idk really just feel like the class is way to easy to kit now days.</div></div><hr />

If Juggernaut gave you a run speed boost for 4 or 5 seconds after a Charge. Thus, you can actually attack your bloody target! As it is, Charge often lands you out of melee range of your target, and doesn't even seem to trigger the stun effect that's supposed to keep your target in place. Having the speed boost sort of makes sense, and would really help.<br />
<br />
Heck, maybe even add another spec to replace Improved Hamstring (I mean seriously, 2 GCD's to get a root? On a 30 second cooldown?) with a talent that makes you immune to snares after a Charge (Improved Juggernaut, maybe). <br />
<br />
Just something. And feel free to increase the cooldown on Charge if you get all that. As it is, Charge is next to worthless and Warriors are too easy to snare and root.<br />
<br />
Oh, and saying Warriors had 100% uptime is a joke. Casters are the ones with 100% uptime currently, even when moving! And they ALL seem to have at least one of the following: ranged stuns, ranged cc, ranged snare, ranged root, movement speed cooldowns, instant cast heals...<br />

Now, what I think it would be great, extremely useful and versatile would be some sort of &quot;spell blocking-parrying&quot;, so your weapon gets charged with the spell you just blocked, and you get a period of time available to return the spell with a critical hit or something like that.<br />

<br />
I'm sorry about if the bad ones are qqing then they should l2p already and get used to it, they need to play more and get to know the class better, if we keep buffing warrs to help the bad ones to the &quot;good&quot; rank like the other ones, the good ones will dominate arena</div></div><hr />

There are guild groups that will kick for stupid reasons. &quot;Oh this guy will need on your trinket. Lets kick him.&quot; I have seen groups kick for lulz.

Anyway, i think case insensitivity makes easier to take a hit within that certain number of attempts. Take the &quot;everyday users&quot; password choice and combine it with a little social engineering skill -&gt; a few attempts could lead to success. I know its not the blizzard fault if the a user takes a password which easy to guess, but i think making the passwords case sensitive isn't a big work (or it is, i don't really know just guessing) , but it can give more protection.<br />
Making the password case sensitive will most likely cause more issues than it will solve. The majority of people who are hacked are not done so through Brute Force, they are done through Key Logging. So a case sensitive password will do nothing for you there. Case sensitive passwords will also likely lead to a great number of tickets and phone calls to their tech support of people not understanding that their password is case sensitive.</div></div><hr />

You literally had to be a complete idiot for a warrior to have 100% up time on you. Some classes couldn't do much about it, but most of them could. Of course they didn't think to buff those few classes who couldn't peel warriors with some better defense or escape mechanisms.<br />
<br />
*Sigh* they'll just never admit where they're wrong, and they are flat out completely wrong about warrior mobility. Heroic Leap is useless. The vast majority of warrior agree that it's mostly useless, no matter how fun on occasion it may be.<br />
<br />
And don't get me started on the fact that warriors already had extremely low representation in high rank arena before this patch. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

Wow. I didn't even know they weren't case sensitive until these posts, and I found it so unbelievable that I had to go try it on my (mixed case) password. How absurd that they would preach account security so heavily while defeating huge numbers of permutations that a brute force attack would need to try! I'm actually a bit angry right now, and I don't make it a habit to get angry about games....</div></div><hr />

mate, i'd like to think you joking, wtf your talking about, seems like &quot;lets give all classes spells and range dps&quot;, warrior should be devastating in melee not at range. lizzards are funny: yep arms has high mobility, but there is too much CC, so now our dps uptime vs most of classes is freaking low, espessially vs kite classes(nice players were ok even before 4.0.6) whom can kite us to death without any troubles. So soon they buff our DPS, then they buff our mobility again and then again and again, or mb they remove some of CC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing I would give Warriors right now is a cc of some sort, as when I see one join a random dungeon as dps I immediately think &quot;oh great another fail warrior who cant interrupt and has no cc, I'll be tanking more mobs then. Hope the healer is good : /&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shapeshifting nerf in this answer clearly show that NO ONE of Blizz devs plays a Feral!!!<br />
<br />
If they would Shapeshifting nerf wold be different! Instead of removing &quot;root&quot; effect, Shapeshifting change would be :<br />
<br />
The act of shapeshifting frees the caster of root effects. (Feral would lose snare removal!)<br />
<br />
In Cat form every Feral have increased speed of 30% or ~50% with PvP set to at least partly negate &quot;slowness&quot;. To help mitigate constant snaring there is Dash, Stampeding Roar and Beserk should also be remade to increase speed. Another major aspect would be that Shred for the sake of PvP would surely need to get rid of positional requirement!<br />
<br />
That clearly show that &quot;logic&quot; is not strong in Blizz devs and always take the most lazy approach to &quot;class balance&quot;!</div></div><hr />

Not entirely true. Enraged regeneration needs and consumes an enrage effect for it's whole duration so there goes the extra damage! Fury's problem is that it gets bigger enraged regeneration from mastery. So while arms is stuck on 30% and long cooldown, you can get it easily to 80% for fury if you just stack mastery like a madman and take the increased healing talents. So now you can see why everyone just wants to be the big hitting truck with nice health regen! <br />
<br />
Fury also got only 40s Heroic leap with the skirmisher talent what makes arms to have even less mobility, not that it makes a big difference compared to 1 charge vs 2 intercept. Victory rush is another thing, but still needs a killing blow to activate so you can't use it that often on arena. :)<br />
<br />
I was fury when cata hit and I already killed Protection paladins with 160k hp in 4 GCD's when I had loads of mastery in 346 blues. I predicted it would be even more &quot;unbalanced&quot; in pvp in the future and I wasn't so wrong. Myself I went to arms on PVE because of the hit stacking back then and tbh haven't changed back to fury even after the patch...</div></div><hr />

WTF! So warriors are getting a utility to keep uptime higher? Are they f'ing SERIOUS?!? What about Intercept, Piercing Howl, heroic fury, skirmisher, Glyph of Hamstring, Heroic Leap for starters? That is not counting the stuns and snares a warrior can do. Couple that with high damage output makes the warrior a serious PVP machine.

I never said anything about firing ranged spells, it was more like charging your weapon with the magic energy of the blocked spell for extra damage on the next hit/critical hit. Dont get mad at me :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been playing the Warrior class since Vanilla, so I'm kind of used to painful nerfs like these :p but I believe what Blizzard said was a &quot;humiliation&quot; to the Warrior fanbase for three reasons:<br />
<br />
1- Blizzard, you admit that you had to provide casters with more instant cast spells and casting on the move to compensate for Arms Warriors' excessive mobility (and I had absolutely no problem with that) yet you nerf mobility whilst leaving casters' improved tools intact?! This didn't make any sense! These abilities (including CC ones) were improved to match the level of Warrior's mobility pre-patch, but the old mobility is gone now!<br />
<br />
2- <br />
Worst blizz response i've ever read. He tried to downplay everything and tried to place the blame on us when we have been responding to the issues all along. Sorry blizz you messed up and deserve to get flamed repeatedly for this. Can't downplay something this bad and blame the community that HAS been telling you heroic leap issues.<br />
<br />
Amurru pretty much covered my second point. You blame your fans for unwilling to provide proper feedback on the unreliability of Heroic Leap while they've been actually making threads on this particular skill all along?! Yet again, you admit that Heroic Leap involves a lot of movement code, which can be translated into more programming/testing invested... So, why do you introduce an unfinished ability in the first place?!<br />
<br />
3- Last but not least, Blizzard, you describe the Arms Warrior as &quot;A battle-hardened master of two-handed weapons, using mobility and overpowering attacks to strike opponents down,&quot; yet you make the Fury and Protection Warriors more mobile (after the nerfs)?! How weak and inaccurate of a design is that?!<br />
<br />
<br />
Whether the entire WoW community agrees on some or all of my points or not, please discuss and share thoughts! Quoting my comment would be highly appreciated so everyone would see it, perhaps an MMO Champion's moderator and/or a Blizzard's forum reader would participate! ;)</div></div><hr />
