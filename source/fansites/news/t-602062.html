WotLK Release date<br />
A lot of people have been speculating because of the release dates announced on various shopping sites (actually I think we had a post here), well, you can stop speculating. <br />
We haven't announced a release date as of yet. When we do, you'll see it up on the official web site here. Retailers have to put some sort of a release date in order to list a game for sale and accept pre-sales for those games. When they do put down a date, it's generally an educated guess. <br />
<br />
Pet disappearing when mounted<br />
Sorry hunters and locks, no more pets running with you while you're mounted. <br />
Having the pet disappear when mounted resolved a number of issues people were experiencing and we are happy with how it has been working. No one likes an exhausted pet, so this way the pet shows up by your side and is ready to growl, bite, cleave, or torment (among other things) right after you dismount.<br />
<br />
There is always a possibility of changing this again, but we currently have no plans to do so. <br />
<br />
Blizzcon beta key + WotLK Beta information<br />
So ... Is the Blizzcon beta key for WotLK or Starcraft 2 ? In both cases, don't worry there will be (a lot) more keys !<br />
Q: Any word on what game the key is gonna be for? and if so does anyone have a date on it?<br />
A: Undetermined as of yet. <br />
<br />
Please don't forget that the BlizzCon beta keys represent a very small portion of our beta community when it's time for a beta. We take players from various sources when it's time for beta so that as many people as we feel necessary are given the opportunity to help us test. <br />

51 Points talents<br />
You can add them to the list of things we won't see before a long time.<br />
We understand that the new talents are highly anticipated by our players so we don’t want to rush them. Keep in mind that these talents aren’t designed to automatically win fights but to add additional depth to their respective talent trees and to the game play. When we are closer to launching the expansion and the new talents are becoming finalized, we look forward to sharing information on them with everybody.</div></div><hr />

The plan is for a percentage of the +heal stat on items with pure +heal to be added as +spell damage, for no extra cost. Further details and exceptions will be discussed at a later time.<br />
<br />
I understand this as, for example, a cloth spaulder +80 healing is in reality +80 spelldmg for no extra cost. Hope it's only for &quot;healer&quot; talents or that i don't understand the concept at all.</div></div><hr />

Keyword in Blizzard description is 'percentage'. So probably only a percent like 20% from your +healing will be added to +dmg.</div></div><hr />

Keyword in Blizzard description is 'percentage'. So probably only a percent like 20% from your +healing will be added to +dmg.<br />
<br />
And just so all you guys start understanding better, it's going to be a low % of +healing converted to +sp. Not going to be an equivalent because... Awake of Nihilum currently has +2500 healing, and i know I don't want a 7k Frostbolt one shoting a healer. And yes, fu Juju :P<br />
Also, most gear already gives sp and healing so another chunk of % off healing is going to almost double the sp, so a healer (any healer besides the priest :/) will be doing great with his other skills. Paladins can all go shockadins with no respec, druids can boom and shamans... well..... pewpew uberness. Not sure how priests are gonna use more sp for smite tho :/</div></div><hr />

So pieces that are already +dmg and +healing will not get a larger dmg bonus.</div></div><hr />

How difficult can this be? A percentage? How about 100%?! Change every item that says +healing to be +damage and +healing and call it a day. kthnx ::)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arames</div><div class="date">2007-09-11, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well the current value is 50% for damage vs healing gear. There are a few items, like the Vengence of the Illidari, that give a +spell dmg buff on click and double that in +healing. That said I doubt it will be higher or even equal to 50%. Otherwise there would be little reason for healing classes to aquire anything but +heal gear since they would gain the same amount of damage as if they aquired +dmg gear. Also, I see this being a trainable ability (% heal to spell dmg) so that mages and warlock keep their filthy mitts of the healer gear.</div></div><hr />

heh, depth...riiiight. Rogues got soooo much depth with their tbc talents I wouldnt count on more this time. mutilate &lt;= backstab, useless subtely talents, sword/dagger/mace builds no longer balanced etc</div></div><hr />

the percentage of spell damage gained with +healing will probably just be enough so healers can kill stuff without having to take a few bio breaks in between :P<br />
<br />
I'm thinking we're gonna get a lot more fights where the healers have to do some sort of dps for ZA, SP, and WotLK ;D</div></div><hr />

For your sake, I hope you're joking. Otherwise, please reroll out of the Rogue class. Sub-tree is not useless and still has PvP practicality. The only major disappointments have been Shadowstep, with server/client lag causing us to 'step into walls, and the Preparation nerf. Sleight of Hand, Heightened Senses, Dirty Tricks, Endurance, Serrated Blades, and Cheat Death are all worth their salt.<br />
<br />
Combat swords is fine. Combat Maces is a bit OP and getting balanced next patch w/ the the overall nerf to Mace Spec for both warriors and rogues. Combat Daggers is still going strong in PvE.<br />
<br />
Besides, we already get buffs to our other stats from our AGI anyway. This adjustment for healers would be no different. Personally however, I'd like to see if the Devs would look into the possibility of Agility affecting a rogue's resilience rating instead of dodge rating. This would of course lead to a massive redestribution of stats on all the Rogue PvP gear if implemented, but it's an idea worth looking into.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately I'm not joking. Sub-tree is useless in high pvp play. Yes, you can have some fun with it in random games if you dont care about your rating, but for 3v3 and 5v5 sub tree is just making fights harder for yourself.<br />
Like you said shadowstep is useless with lag. Endurance, Sleight of Hand and Serrated Blades were introduced before TBC iirc. Cheat Death? heh, come on.... Dirty Tricks was introduced just after the trinket nerf, so...you loose some you get some, nothing changes...at least for the people that can actually get that talent.<br />
<br />
The only major talent we got is Combat potency and maybe Shiv for pvp imo. Everything else is either not worth taking or not changing much (like how bad a 41pt talent have to be if people have to use math to compare it to a basic skill if they want to see what is better).<br />
<br />

Well for pve its combat swords&gt;combat daggers&gt;combat maces for pvp combat maces&gt;combat swords&gt;combat daggers. Imo daggers should be top pve damage becouse they loose a lot of utility in other areas of the game (pvp,solo,questing....)<br />
<br />
About those healing changes...well as a pure class that can only do 1 thing out of 3 (tanking,dps,healing) I dont like any changes that allow other classes do more than their 1 thing. <br />
I know that this one change wont make holy priests take raid spots as dps, but like what happened with druids, brick to brick, change to change and you get a class that can do everything. And they do it not much worse than pure classes. Tanking? sure, dps? sure - and thats all in 1 tree. Healing? sure, ranged dps? why not. <br />
Yeah, you might need different build for it and different gear. But isnt that what makes the game fun to play and gives more depth? With 1 character you can experience all the game has to offer with only a mouse click and 50g.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ronnosh</div><div class="date">2007-09-12, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally, Sub Tree should provide more survivability and disruption than what it currently is doing as an &quot;Assassination-Lite&quot; tree. I'd ask for a talent that affects a rogue's resilience, but Sleight of Hand technically gives us 80 resilience worth of crit mitigation.</div></div><hr />
