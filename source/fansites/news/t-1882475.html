Battle.Net Voice Chat<br />
It looks like Voice Chat might be coming to Battle.Net. An upcoming Battle.Net Client build has references to Vivox (http://www.vivox.com/gaming-solutions/integrated-voice.html), a company that produces voice chat for games. It is in use already in Eve, World of Tanks, The Elder Scrolls Online, H1Z1, Star Trek Online, Second Life, and many other games. As always, this is just a possibility and nothing is guaranteed! Sometimes features are planned (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236761-appear-offline-option-coming-soon-to-battlenet/) but just don't work out.<br />

Blizzcon - Engineering Panel Update<br />
It looks like Virtual Ticket viewers won't get to see the Engineering Panel after all (https://twitter.com/kurtismcc/status/649585697955803136). <br />

Poll - Voice Chat<br />
Assuming it works as well as it does in the other games that already have integrated it, would you use Battle.Net voice chat? <br />
<br />

Meh I can't say the same tbh. The whole server/technical side of a game doesn't interest me personally. It's cool to glance at though so I can imagine your frustration there. As for voice chat after BC voice chat I just think this will be another thing no one uses since there is already good voice software out there such as Ventrilo, Teamspeak, Mumble and Raidcall.</div></div><hr />

Exactly but we have the other well known voice software for that. Not dismissing it outright but tbh I expect it to go the way of WoW's voice chat.</div></div><hr />

There is a huge difference in the old voice chat that was designed by Blizzard, and the new one being mentioned that is developed by an outside company, and is in use in many current MMOs.</div></div><hr />

I agree it's a bit unfair to those who are into that sort of thing that they removed it but it's not on any of the main stages so if they wanted to show it to VT holders I would imagine they would have to reschedule stuff and more than likely with the schedule done everything is set in stone now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need a sub to use the WoW app. Battle.net would be for all your friends on it, playing or not, and right now almost none plays WoW thanks for the terrible expansion. So yea, I would like that app for mobiles for chatting. And no, I don't use facebook, and even if I did, I probably would not have everyone there anyway.</div></div><hr />

It was actually pretty horrible. Rarely worked and no one bothered to use it because of that.<br />
<br />
I remember I didn't want to download Vent on someone else's computer that I was playing WoW on, so I tried to use the built in voice. It would actually have been better not to use anything and just type shit out. It was miserable.<br />

This. I found out about Discord a few weeks ago. I'm trying to get all my friends to switch to it, their only problem with it is the UI but I personally like the UI quite a bit.<br />
<br />
And having multiple servers that are easily accessible AND free? I don't understand who WOULDN'T want Discord over everything else.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard didn't announce anything. An employee used Twitter to solicit discussion topics for a possible panel and MMOC reported on it.<br />
<br />
They're probably not going to discuss &quot;graphics&quot; however. The panel is focused on software and hardware engineering.</div></div><hr />

It might be nice for pugs so you don't need to get random people on your brand of voicechat. Probably not a good idea for LFR though; I can only imagine the horrors of a dozen kids yelling at people.</div></div><hr />

Also I don't understand how hard it would be to set up a camera crew at them either and just add and additional 'channel' to the viewing option. Honestly between last year and this year it feels like their putting less and less effort into the Virtual Ticket and I only hope the production issues from last year are cleared up for those of you who bought the ticket this time around. Also its nice to see them giving a intergrated voice chat another shot, considering how much time has passed since BC when we got the first attempt I think this one could actually work out real well.</div></div><hr />

I've never forgotten Patch 2.2.0. Only thing worthwhile about it was the addition of in-game voice chat, and the first times people tried it, everybody agreed -- it was awful. Also, as Threaperzone pointed out, it's still in the game settings.<br />

Agree.<br />
<br />
It's clearly stated as a reference in battle.net, so most likely it's not a WoW thing.<br />
<br />
Either it will be an improvement to battle.net social system, allowing cross-game voice chat and perhaps coming along more development on the battle.net app (battle.net groups/guilds please!), or it's just a third-party &quot;credits&quot; reference since most likely it will be powering Overwatch's in-game voicechat.<br />
<br />
Either way, people need to stop behaving like every change that doesn't promote their personal taste is bad.<br />
<br />
Yes, twitter integration for instance is nearly meaningless even for those who might use it (even though it's not like it stole a lot of development time from other things &lt;_&lt;).<br />
<br />
But something like a battle.net app voicechat could be benefitial to a lot of players. Sure, most established guilds are ok with whatever system they're using. But smaller and less serious guilds might enjoy a more direct and simple approach to it. Same goes for group finder pug raids that might want to use voicechat in a simpler way.</div></div><hr />

Can you imagine LoL with voice chat? It's DEFINITELY not going to be active in random games of Overwatch nor Heroes of the Storm - Hell, they even restricted NORMAL chat in Heroes simply because they can't trust their players to not be vitriolic assholes anymore.</div></div><hr />

It's has nothing to do with quality - it's all about control. Every corp/alliance has their own private server that they can control access to and divide up into rooms as they see fit. Eve voice looks pretty good for fleets but isn't flexible enough relative to how I see private servers set up.<br />
<br />
This is also my experience with WoW too - the guild has a server with officer chat, rooms for raids, 5-mans and PvP, afk, HotS etc.<br />
<br />
To the best of my knowledge, this is why the in-game systems aren't used as much as they might be.</div></div><hr />

I also think that a decent voice chat system would be a good addition. I have Skype and TS3, but I would prefer an integrated voicechat.
