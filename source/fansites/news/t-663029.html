Mage concerns<br />
Those are good questions and sadly I don't have time right now to answer them all. I will try and address the infamous &quot;pace yourself&quot; comment.<br />
<br />
First, I'm talking about PvE here, and that means I'm going to skip over Frost for the moment. Sorry. We know how Frost should work in PvE and we need to get it there without making it too good in PvP. With the Arcane changes in 3.2.2 mages should now have two viable raiding specs again, which is an improvement. I ask that you not derail this thread into a Frost discussion.<br />
<br />
To be brief to the point of simplicity, we see the Fire playstyle as being more about lining up your cooldowns to maximize your damage (and that improves trinkets as well as spells). Mana is a consideration the way it is for most mana users, but shouldn't be at the fore front of every decision you make and you do have ways of restoring mana if you get into trouble.<br />
<br />
Arcane is a little different. We want Arcane to care about mana more. Sorry if that offends casters who think their output should be unlimited, but if it really bugs you, I suggest you try Fire. A lot of Arcane mages like the way mana works for their spec, and Arcane Blast is pretty obviously designed with that gameplay in mind.<br />
<br />
What we're trying to do is give Arcane two rotations: the low mana, lower dps version and the higher mana, higher dps version. The first rotation would mean doing things like keeping Blast at 3 stacks, and the second would mean going into 4 stacks. Your trade-off for going to the expensive rotation would be that you could do higher dps than Fire if and when you had enough mana to keep that cycle going. This then becomes where the player skill of Arcane comes in -- knowing when you can afford to step it up for max dps and when you need to pace yourself.<br />
<br />
I say all that because we're still tweaking the Arcane numbers for 3.2.2 and that might include increasing the mana cost of stack 4, since the free Missile Barrage procs are already a pretty generous mana break as it is. I know some players will try and keep the 4 stack Arcane Blast up all the time and will then call it a class design problem when they run OOM. That's what those short cooldown Innervates are for. We also might lower the duration of the Arcane Blast buff / debuff to make sure Arcane Barrage is the clear choice for when you are time constrained (like say you have to move or do something else).<br />
<br />
This means we are asking a little more out of Arcane mages. To be honest, some of them responded negatively to the Arcane buff in 3.2.2 because they felt like they had to sacrifice too much of what they enjoyed about the playstyle (which includes mana as a potentially limiting resource). We are trying to nail that sweet spot while still boosting sustained Arcane dps.<br />
<br />
The goal is NOT to push every mage into Arcane next patch because it's the new flavor of the month for highest theoretical dps. We don't want you to have to regem and everything whenever we come out with a new patch and a new spec is on top. We want you to have a choice between Fire and Arcane (and maybe someday Frost). Arcane will &quot;beat&quot; Fire sometimes, but not all the time.<br />
<br />
I know that's a lot of philosophy dumped quickly, and doubtless it will spawn a lot of other questions, but that's the idea in a nutshell. Try and take it at the high-level spirit in which it is offered instead of trying to read too much into every word I chose. :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: I should have put the smiley face after Innervate. The intent of Arcane is that you have to watch your mana, but also have solutions for dealing it, principally Evocation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110160602-the-new-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />

New shard system<br />
I don't make many promises because even when I say &quot;there is a very slight chance we may eventually consider changing this at some point in the future&quot; that then becomes &quot;promised us next patch.&quot; :)<br />
<br />
But we are excited about the shard system and we think warlocks will view it as a cool component to their class instead of a hassle they have to put up with.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't view it as a &quot;buff.&quot; I'm not sure your dps really needs a buff at the moment if that's what you mean. If you mean taking something kind of marginal and perhaps annoying and making it cool, then that's what we intend to to.<br />
<br />
Too often our recent design has just been to marginalize shards more and more. That isn't the direction we want for the class though. We want shards to be one of the main things you think about as a lock, but that includes rewarding you when you use them well.

Rage mechanisms<br />
We'd like to fix rage and we have a plan. However it's clear from the OP that he or she shares the view that a lot of warriors do, specifically that you don't have enough rage until you get epics at which point it finally &quot;feels right.&quot; The implication is that our fix for rage should be that you always have the same rage you do in epics, or more to the point that you should always generally have enough rage to do what you want to do and lack of it never really holds you back.<br />
<br />
If we changed rage to normalize it more, then it would mean that you would have say 60% of rage all the time instead of having 20% in green gear and 100% in purple gear (to use made up numbers).

Perhaps adding in a tab for itself in the currency pannel?<br />
for example you could then have as many as you want without it taking up any bag space and also make it so the amount of soul shards is displayed somewhere. :)</div></div><hr />

Fire, despite the statement &quot;we see the Fire playstyle as being more about lining up your cooldowns&quot; does not HAVE any cooldowns (asides from potions which Arcane has as well). Fire has Combustion, but Combustion is a negligable DPS increase and it does not really matter when you pop it. The playstyle behind fire is &quot;no Burst, but higher 'steady' dps&quot;.<br />
<br />
I also wonder about the &quot;Innervate&quot; comment. Or did he confuse it with &quot;Evocate&quot;?<br />
<br />
Did the blue poster confuse Fire with Frostfire? Fire does not have IV !!! And Frostfire is dps-wise ways back behind both the new Arcane and Fire. Both Theorycrafting and Simulation showed that<br />
if there is no further change, Arcane &gt; Fire &gt; Frostfire.<br />
<br />
The argumentation of the blueposter (&quot;The goal is NOT to push every mage into Arcane next <br />
patch because it's the new flavor of the month for highest theoretical dps&quot;). The problem is only that the changes they did do not match with this intention... the bluepost goes one direction, the actual changes 180 degree the opposite direction. Well, maybe they still change something to make the two of them actually match. Up to now the thing the blueposter wants to prevent is exactly what has been happening with every major patch.<br />
<br />
Personally I think they should give some Fire talent 3% hit added. This would make the itemization<br />
for the 3 raid specs closer to each other, and also would give Fire a bit of a boost to catch up with<br />
the new Arcane. Having the itemization closer to each other would be better also, that if the<br />
&quot;top dps spec&quot; changes again, it is not that much of a problem to change specs... in the lootsystem of my guild I have to specify at the release of a new raid, on which items I want<br />
priority (only one per slot), a list which should not be changed later. A spec-change which changes<br />
the hit-requirement by up to 6% is a problem there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Says a frostmage who spams out frostbolts? Sorry, Fire is currently the most interesting<br />
spec to play (with all those LB's to keep up...), while I see Frost as the most boring one...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fannyd</div><div class="date">2009-08-19, 10:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Having played a few other classes one thing I did realise is that Warlocks don't actually have any big Damage Multiplying Cooldowns (eg, Dancing Rune Weapon, Blade Flurry).<br />
<br />
An idea would be to be able to &quot;use&quot; a shard for a damage buff for a short period of time with a larger cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
This could be implemented as +damage for us:<br />
&quot;Dark enrage&quot; - Tap into the power of a soul and deal 50% more damage for 10seconds, 5 minute cooldown<br />
<br />
Or maybe even summon an extra, aggresive pet (could be of ghost form):<br />
&quot;Raise Soul&quot; - Raise the soul of a recently dispatched enemy, causing him to attack your opponent for 15sec, 5 minute cooldown.<br />
A really cool feature of this could be that the soul comes in a ghost form of the actual enemy that you stole the soul from. <br />
<br />
Of cause this may cause damage balancing issues and we may need to take a slight nerf in overall damage to make up for it, but that's cool. I'd much rather have a few cooldowns that require a bit of skill to nail.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stuff to think about anyway</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LavaDuck</div><div class="date">2009-08-19, 10:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting concept Fannyd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Someone has probably already answered this, but WoW shamanism = commune with the elements of fire, earth, water, wind. Natural as those things may be to you and me, in WoW they aren't really considered &quot;nature&quot;. Not in the same way as druids revere nature. <br />
<br />
Ignore the mechanics whereby SHaman use the &quot;nature&quot; school of magic, the magic schools confuse things. Like druids using arcane magic by mechanics, when in fact they are gifts from elune.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm for this idea. There's no way they're going to try to make using shards more fun, meaning we'd have a desire to carry more (not just a necessity), without some sort of system like this. They could make shards stack, but if they did neither that would kill our bag space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or he passes leadership to Cairne and assumes the mantle of Guardian, safe in the knowledge that the Horde will be safe. Garrosh/Alliance then has Cairne killed, Garrosh take up leadership of the Horde and declares war. Everyone happy. (Thrall can fulfill his dream of being with Jaina.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think that's really an accurate comparison, totally different types of resource mechanics.<br />
<br />
What I'd really like to see, though, is for warlocks to have something like the blood mage's Verdant Spheres. Those orbs rotating around them absorb a portion of the soul from all demons the blood mage kills, empowering the caster.<br />
<br />
Blizzard seems like they want to come up with a way for soul shards to both never be a hassle, and to provide some sort of passive benefit to the player as an insentive for them to use them. I'm predicting that the different stone mechanics will be revamped, as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, as for the comic stuff, very interesting. If Thrall joins the Order of Tirisfal, he certainly will need a replacement to rule in Orgrimmar.</div></div><hr />

I had a strong feeling something was off about some of the leaks, as if they weren't false, just not completely accurate. Thrall becoming a member of the Council of Tirisfal as opposed to the actual Guardian itself makes a ton more sense and the comic teaser appears to confirm that this is the direction the story is going.</div></div><hr />

How is frost more fun?!?!?!? In PvE you ONLY do frostbolts. And sometimes your Fingers of frost procs and you get 2 crits. WOAH. Christ<br />
<br />
Bad changes. (Frost)Fire is awesome, but still alot lower dps than many classes that has alot more to offer to a raid. When i saw there was a lot of blue text with mages, i hoped it was to even out the dps of damagedealers, so we actually had a chance to be ontop of the damagemeters at more places than Hodir.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But we are excited about the shard system and we think warlocks will view it as a cool component to their class instead of a hassle they have to put up with.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't view it as a &quot;buff.&quot; I'm not sure your dps really needs a buff at the moment if that's what you mean. If you mean taking something kind of marginal and perhaps annoying and making it cool, then that's what we intend to to.<br />
<br />
Too often our recent design has just been to marginalize shards more and more. That isn't the direction we want for the class though. We want shards to be one of the main things you think about as a lock, but that includes rewarding you when you use them well. <br />

It's a preview, not finalized. The final version usually has some differences from the preview.<br />
<br />
The art quality has improved a hundred fold over the last few issues -- it hit a pretty low point during the Varian Wrynn story arc, up until more recently. The art's not bad at all right now, actually considering reading it again.<br />
<br />
But no, all in all, the main comic series isn't that great. They seem to be working to improve it, at least. The Ashbringer miniseries was good, though, and I definitely suggest checking that one out.</div></div><hr />

I'm very enthusiastic about the Mage changes, I played Arcane very successfully pre-3.1 (dealing more damage than better equipped Arcane mages in my raid, &lt;3 twitchy fingers, and couple cups of coffee during the raid) and was sad to see it overshadowed by FFB and Fire/TTW in 3.1 again.<br />
By now I also really like FFB (I play it even though Fire/TTW is supposedly better, I just really don't like the style of it) but it'll be great to once again have the choice.<br />

I dont get the thing with undergeared warriors. Ive seen wars in blues doing 4k dps on Cyanigosa in heroic vh and ive seen others not even doing 1,5k. In Ulduar there is big difference too between the warriors of my guild although they wear nearly the same stuff.<br />
I dont think that its so much a rage problem, its just that some people are playing the class better than others...<br />
<br />
The problem with rage is, that warriors not only scale with the statincreases like other classes. The better your gear, the more rage you get and your dmg output grows even more. Your dmg wont rise by having higher manareg (as long as you dont go oom of cause ^^) and you dont get faster energy regen execept for set boni.<br />
It would be easier to balance warriors between low gear and endgame gear, if they always get the same amount of rage.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, there are also a lot of council members not a part of that shot, either.<br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that they might employ more than one Shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Instability</div><div class="date">2009-08-19, 04:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Up to now I saw the lining up of Cooldowns more in the Arcane's domain (when do I pop AP and IV?). Fire, despite the statement &quot;we see the Fire playstyle as being more about lining up your cooldowns&quot; does not HAVE any cooldowns (asides from potions which Arcane has as well). Fire has Combustion, but Combustion is a negligable DPS increase and it does not really matter when you pop it. The playstyle behind fire is &quot;no Burst, but higher 'steady' dps&quot;.<br />
<br />
I also wonder about the &quot;Innervate&quot; comment. Or did he confuse it with &quot;Evocate&quot;?<br />
<br />
Did the blue poster confuse Fire with Frostfire? Fire does not have IV !!! And Frostfire is dps-wise ways back behind both the new Arcane and Fire. Both Theorycrafting and Simulation showed that<br />
if there is no further change, Arcane &gt; Fire &gt; Frostfire.<br />
<br />
The argumentation of the blueposter (&quot;The goal is NOT to push every mage into Arcane next <br />
patch because it's the new flavor of the month for highest theoretical dps&quot;). The problem is only that the changes they did do not match with this intention... the bluepost goes one direction, the actual changes 180 degree the opposite direction. Well, maybe they still change something to make the two of them actually match. Up to now the thing the blueposter wants to prevent is exactly what has been happening with every major patch.<br />
<br />
Personally I think they should give some Fire talent 3% hit added. This would make the itemization<br />
for the 3 raid specs closer to each other, and also would give Fire a bit of a boost to catch up with<br />
the new Arcane. Having the itemization closer to each other would be better also, that if the<br />
&quot;top dps spec&quot; changes again, it is not that much of a problem to change specs... in the lootsystem of my guild I have to specify at the release of a new raid, on which items I want<br />
priority (only one per slot), a list which should not be changed later. A spec-change which changes<br />
the hit-requirement by up to 6% is a problem there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In that case,arcane would need more than 50% critical damage bonus to make itemization the same and possibly even a hot streak-like talent.Always make sure you look at the problem from different points of view.As for the loot problem,too bad.<br />
<br />

Amen to that. I do have fire/frost dual spec on my 80 mage but I rarely raid or do heroics much these days so I mostly just stick with the frost. The survivability is way better, IMHO, and I more importantly I can put out good sustained dps without running out of mana.</div></div><hr />

He is of course, imo, referring to Evocation. However I've had mages in pug raids scream out in vent for innervate. I always just instantly fire back with a &quot;DENIED!&quot; --- they either learn to watch their mana or they quit the raid.<br />
<br />
I've noticed though that it's usually the mages on the very low or high end of the dps that seem to have an issue of doing this. The ones on the low end justify their poor performance by saying &quot;well I had no mana&quot; and the ones on the higher end resort to a God Complex of &quot;I hit 8k!!! My guild uses their innervate on me. In fact, they do what I tell them to do b/c if they don't, I threaten to leave.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Read the preview, her powers are weakening. Mages are suffering from the Nexus War and aren't as powerful as they used to be, which is why they need Druids, Shamans, Paladins, and Priests.

<br />
If we changed rage to normalize it more, then it would mean that you would have say 60% of rage all the time instead of having 20% in green gear and 100% in purple gear (to use made up numbers). <br />
<br />
Is it just me or does this not make any sense? Aren't warriors balanced now with their epic geared rage regen? Wouldn't making it &quot;60%&quot; across the board be a straight nerf? Oh goody, now warriors in greens can have some rage! Woop de doo?

<br />
There are so many things that I'd love to see re-worked and changed regarding warlocks. But, to be perfectly honest, more than anything right now, I just really hope that shards will eventually stack. Or, that they'll be altered in a way that removes them from needing to be carried in one of your inventory bags, therefore correcting that issue in the process. <br />
<br />
I hate that I have so much less space for gear and other items. Especially now with dual specs, I feel like inventory space is crucial. And, to have an entire inventory bag taken up for shards, that could so simply stack into one pile of 32, seems unnecessary. I can't really think of any logical reason to not alter shards in this way, when it would be so beneficial and help to polish up a mechanic of warlocks that often feels like a loose end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
While indeed it's still out in the open, I'm sure we can agree that it makes heaps more sense for Thrall to join the Council and Me'dan ascend to be the next Guardian than for Thrall to be the Guardian. The majority of Horde and Alliance fans alike would never accept a figure so important to the Horde as the successor to Medivh. I'm also curiously interested how the comic teaser also has Me'dan describing the holy magic he is learning from the paladin Maraad as similar to shaman magic, possibly foreshadowing the bridge needed to explain away the rumored added race/class combo of Tauren Paladin/Priest. <br />
<br />
Still not ready to take most of the leaks as gospel yet, but the allusions in the teaser are lending some reasonable credence towards some of the more questionable parts. Three days and counting and we'll know for sure what's in store...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This could be implemented as +damage for us:<br />
&quot;Dark enrage&quot; - Tap into the power of a soul and deal 50% more damage for 10seconds, 5 minute cooldown<br />
<br />
<br />
I love this idea actually. The number of times my guild is working on a boss and they'll say, so in this phase we need to burn him quickly, save your cooldowns for this phase. I'm always thinking yeah, cooldowns... =( Where's my cooldowns?<br />
<br />
I like your Dark Enrage idea, or possibly one that increases your damage for a longer period, but only if you're standing in your demonic circle, sort of like deploying a cannon, go Dark Enrage for mobility fights, use the longer duration buff on fights where you can get in your circle for a decent length of time.<br />
<br />

I do not think +3% Hit == +50% Crit Damage &quot;in effect&quot;. 3% Hit extra for fire could cope with the 5% higher damage &quot;new arcane&quot; has currently, though.<br />
<br />
As to steadyness of fire... sure, fire is steady compared to a burst-spec (higher dps, but no burst), at least taking the situation on live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Fire is RNG ridden - the number and rythm of you crits affect the DPS. So it is not as bursty (on demand) as arcane, but it is spikier (meaning that it can top even arcane burst if you are on a lucky string).<br />
<br />
Anyway, the issue of &quot;normalizing&quot; mage gear accross the different specs: <br />

Hit is mostly a non issue - there is plenty of hit around and it is the cheapest stat. Actually the problem is dumping excessive hit :P. Anyway, ofc that making similar hit values available on all trees would bring the desirable itemization nearer accross specs. <br />
<br />
But the greatest difference is indeed the crit value - fire values crit far above the arcane tree (that has probably the lowest crit multi on all DPS casters). Hence TTW fire (and FFB) value crit, while arcane values haste.</div></div><hr />
