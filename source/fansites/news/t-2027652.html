They aren't required, but they are an option for end game world quests instead of doing ALL PvE quests. You can just do all PvE quests and not worry about pet battales or PvP if you want.</div></div><hr />

Just accept the fact that nothing Blizzard says or do these days will appease your unrealistically high standards. The game could dispense free blowjobs and I bet you would still be dissatisfied.</div></div><hr />

A little confused: does this mean world bosses in Legion are lootable only when part of a world quest, or can you still just show up, participate, and have a chance at loot just whenever they're up? As in, the chances at targeting a specific relic is limited to what boss(es) are available any particular week via the world quest?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly what I was thinking. Something to do with the wife while waiting for raids, etc. I will be doing them myself anyways, but there's only so much we can do in the game &quot;together&quot;. She has no interest in raiding or even dungeons for that matter. This is perfect for us to spend time in game together and not make myself feel like I'm wasting time that could be spent on gearing or stuff like that. Will be rewarding for both of us.. Love it.</div></div><hr />

I may be one of them. Literally so much choice on beta that I haven't had in.... I don't remember how long.... That I had to quit playing beta during the week because I wasn't getting much sleep. It wasn't anything I HAD to get done either. It was just stuff I wanted to do. And that is a level of fun Warcraft hasn't provided me personally in a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World Bosses are lootable and you can use bonus roll tokens without needing the world quest. The world quest for a world boss is just an additional reward to whatever the world boss gives you. Currently in beta there are 13 possible world bosses but only 3 are ever active per week similar to the world bosses in Gorgrond currently except instead of having just 2 and switching every week, there might be a boss that we would only see a couple of weeks through the year due to the high number of them to switch between.</div></div><hr />

Not talking about Legion invasions, but actual Horde/Alliance invasions! Would only happen once in a while, not every day. Gives the player the ability to explore the other faction's city, without entering PvP :D<br />
Would be cool events, showing that the war will always be there!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't apply to old zones currently.<br />
Though I expect there to be caps if it were.<br />
As the scaling doesn't produce the desired effect in all content by simply bumping up the numbers.<br />
Alongside the increase in level comes an increase in complexity with abilities used by mobs.<br />
So therefore if there is to be any scaling in lower zones, there should be lower and upper limits for each so that levelling players aren't scaling in zones where the abilities are then out of sync in terms of difficulty.<br />
Scaling a level 1-5 zone up to a player would still have it be trivial.<br />

&quot;Pet Battle quests contribute to all of the different systems in the game, the emissary quests, your artifact progression, earning pet battle tokens and more.&quot; Please someone tell me that pet battles are not an obligation at some point to keep progressing the artifact... I dislike them very much<br />
<br />
By that I assume that the rewards from those quests can be varied, and therefore interesting to more than just pet battling usage.</div></div><hr />

If people do complain about having too much content, I will pray to the Heavens that I will someday gain the ability to strangle them through their monitors.<br />

<br />
This is very subjective. If I can solo a 5 man when no one else in the world can.... I should get the best gear?<br />
<br />
<br />
What they are saying is harder content will reward better gear. A Mythic + dungeon will reward better loot than a normal dungeon or even a lower level Mythic + dungeon.<br />
<br />
They aren't basing the difficulty on you personally.</div></div><hr />

There was a lot of stuff to do at the beginning of MOP too.. people burned out from too much content. Yes, they did. I know several people who stopped playing after going nuts with all those dailies. The key is balance. The fact that they are not dailies, but have different timers will help.. anyways we'll see, at some point you won't need much Order Hall resources and can focus on Artifact Power, etc.<br />
<br />
I was not doing all the MOP dailies every day, so I pretty much gave up on all the gear gated by them.<br />
<br />
Personally my only concern with this is there is no way in hell I'm doing those on more than one character.</div></div><hr />

One of the finer qualitites of offering relevant gear from many sources is that you can focus your attention on certain types of content on certain characters to keep it interesting. That's probably how I will be using my alts at least.</div></div><hr />

The concept of daily quest is just wrong, it transforms a game (that I love) into a job (personally MoP daily quests has been the worst thing I've ever experimented on this game). I'm not saying that I don't want stuff to do, but don't put a temporal constraint for doing so (at least not a small one like &quot;a day&quot;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you're worried about world quests then there's a huge difference to consider. You don't HAVE to do them all or every day to have a chance at the better gear, just go with your own flow. Honestly the only way something like this becomes a job is if you make it one. If you feel you -have- to complete every world quest available every day then yes it's going to be way over the top, but the system is in no way designed for you to get to that point. It's more a &quot;do what suits you best&quot;.</div></div><hr />

How bout you actually read the information that they supplied you?<br />
It gets reset after 3 days! so you have 3 fucking days to do them.<br />
So if you don't do any quests for 3 days you will have 3 days worth of quests there for you to do!<br />

What are they thinking or saying inside the boardroom meetings to each other? Things that they can't say in public because they need to present themselves as understanding and not offend anything that may have a credit card and is interested in staying subscribed to their game, ya'know, what's behind their smiles and chipper attitude when talking about the &quot;issues&quot; of &quot;too much content&quot; in MoP. I can only guess:<br />
<br />
-what the fuck is wrong with these people?<br />

The problem with MoP wasn't daily quests, it was that rep was &quot;required&quot; more than ever. You should be complaining about Profession level 3 recipes being on faction vendors, not the world quests.<br />
<br />
Legion's nothing like Pandaria. I love the world quest system, it feels much more casual, not as punishing to take a break from... But the faction stories, Suramar aside, aren't as good as they were in MoP. World Quests don't give much lore, especially the Warden ones. No questlines as you gain rep from what I've seen, either. Not like 5.1. No alt catch ups for rep. Other than having lots of alts and spamming one particular emissary quest.</div></div><hr />

You aren't only one as Blizzard is considering level scaling and they wouldn't if there were no people who wanted it. <br />
<br />
If Blizz wants to make old content fun then more time walking and raids time walking is great idea. Then they can even allow people to scale down to friends level while grouping IF they choose to scale down. If they enforce level scaling in all zones, dungeons and raids with no option of choice it will be the last day I play Wow as nowdays 90% of things I do in Wow is speed runing old content and getting achievments. If I were to do it hard way (which takes time x 50) then I wouldn't deem it worthy doing. I don't think its unfair for those who spent long time to get these items and achievements in past as they got rewarded then and had gotten their rewards way earlier than anyone else.<br />
<br />
It is not like the old content will become new and fresh just because it will suddenly provide alt alike feeling of challenge. It is old zones and raids that most of people ran hundreds times and they got bored and fed up with these. If to come back to these places again then only as time walking - an event that is not obligatory. They could even introduce time walking zones with special extra rewards and quests behaving like dailies there untill end of event.</div></div><hr />

I didn't mind the daily quests at all on ONE character, but to try and do them on multiple chars. What I didn't like was the rep system at the beginning of MOP. Blizz agreed the gating behind ONE faction was too harsh and ended up tweaking it.<br />
<br />
I am confident the same things can happen here if things don't make sense.<br />
<br />
they will likely increase the rep received from each quest since it's too low now, takes FOREVER to reach exalted, like months</div></div><hr />

Did take me some months to reach exalted with all of them, but I eventually did. It is imho the same thing with Tier Sets and Class Trinkets in LFR - just because you have the opportunity to do something, doesn't necessarily mean that you have to do all, everyday/week. Just constrain yourself a little bit, it is not that hard.<br />
<br />
Am stoked as fuck about the new Legion System - now I can concentrate on my two Mains, and still progress them months/years after the initial Legion release. And not just with Raids - Word Quests, Artifact stuff, Mythic dungeons, Suramar, LFR and Professions. Nice to have so many options to progess my Chars outside of hc/mythic Raiding.</div></div><hr />

And also, MoP dailies were super repetitive because you were doing the same exact quests every day. In Legion, the quests are supposed to be cycled and mixed up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To what change are you referring? Are you referring to the bug they fixed that was allowing players to extend their camera view farther back than the UI allows? This has always been a bug, not a feature. They didn't fix it at the time because it didn't seem harmful, but now that their PVP is less gear-based, and more skill-based they need to fix it, as having a larger viewing area gives a tactical advantage versus those that use the UI stated limit.<br />

There should be a good deal of quests in the &quot;old&quot; world. It's sad that every expansion alienates previous areas. Azeroth has so much incredible scenery and locations that could be utilized for any number of types of quests.<br />
<br />
They said in this video that the old world may get world quests at some point, but since this a new system they want to make sure players like it before inserting it everywhere.<br />

<br />
I can see both sides of this, Personally think scaling should be done on a range, so as long as the base level of the mob is still within 5 levels of you (Back or forward) it should scale to your level, but once it's outside of that bracket it should just be it's regular level. This would still let you feel like you're growing stronger (1-shotting a mob that you used to spend 30-40 seconds fighting) while at the same time still allowing for a variety of leveling zones.</div></div><hr />

if i'm back in a zone i've cleared i should be one shooting enemies that are nothing to me now that i've leveled in power and gear.... why would mob that took me time / effort to kill at lvl 101 be the same at lvl 110? let alone lvl 1 vs 110 if they expand it to old zones.<br />
