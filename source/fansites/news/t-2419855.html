As someone who’s played ele on the Beta a fair bit I can say your comment is complete hyperbole.<br />
It’s not nearly as bad as some claim. Perfect? OP? No. <br />
But not the trash that some of you bandwagon kids want to think. It’s not that Ele is horrible, it’s that there are a couple classes with very specific spells that are over tuned. <br />
I will gladly take a 4% damage buff.</div></div><hr />

Believe what you want, maelstrom gen is still off, damage is still low even with a 4% buff. I'm not &quot;bandwagon-ing&quot; anything, just going off my personal experiences with ele from beta. So you can keep you apple pie in the sky high hopes while waiting for &quot;at least 8.1&quot;. You enjoy it, you trust the devs, thats great, just call me jaded after the same old song and dance after 12 years. <br />
<br />
But to each their own and glad you're enjoying ele and yet another band aid fix. Have a wonderful night. :)</div></div><hr />

but remember that 4% buff to ele in HFC that completely fixed the spec?<br />

if im reading that correctly its not a buff to feral sadly, my guildie got me all excited, its only a buff to other specs taking the feral affinity talents. Although that does seem to reason that bearcatting will be back now</div></div><hr />

Everyone is with you, buddy. It must feel so damn painful falling from god tier to top tier. We're here to support you through that terrible moment of your life.<br />
<br />
You expected Rets to remain untouched when you guys were even more overpowered than the Sin rogues before their nerfs? All god tier specs got nerfed and you're not running away from it. Plus, go play on Gladiator Sanctum now to see that despite the nerfs, you remain in the top 3...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy pally is usually the highest represented healer on mythic and when they aren't highest, they are second highest. Their niche as the only tank healer has meant that the class has had overpowered utility for at least a decade, barring some extremely minor blips here and there. Since the devs have stated that they like this design (where hpally has unique utility that most raids need) I think you'll be fine. It's the other healing specs that are consistently screwed by perpetually op holy pallies.<br />

if your complaining about the top healing spec think of how the other healers feel<br />

bring back cast while moving LB maybe? Might bring me back to actually playing ele again.</div></div><hr />

Either way, i just hope we get a lot more hp than damage increase at 120, because the way it is, casters got no chance. I'd love to play destro and ele more, for example, but it's pretty hopeless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;JUST viable&quot; was 7% more dps than other talents on the row. It'll be less of a dps loss when you have to switch to another talent because the enounter just doesn't play nice with BoS.<br />
Also, they don't care about the legendary, they're fixes for level 120, not some 6 levels people will be over with the second day of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

It must feel so damn painful falling from god tier to top tier. We're here to support you through that terrible moment of your life.<br />
<br />
You expected Rets to remain untouched when you guys were even more overpowered than the Sin rogues before their nerfs? All god tier specs got nerfed and you're not running away from it. Plus, go play on Gladiator Sanctum now to see that despite the nerfs, you remain in the top 3...<br />
<br />
Ret top tier after the nerfs, good joke :D You won't see any ret past 2.2k simply because they now don't bring anythning special into the team, everything that made ret worthy getting into your team (so burst damage and offheals) got nerfed really hard. Why would you play with ret when you can get a rogue that will do same (or more) damage and put enemies into CC for years? Hint - you wouldn't.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fixed it for you, lol.<br />
At least rogues always will be revelant in pvp simply because of ridiculous amount of CC they have.</div></div><hr />

This guy wasn't here for the beginning of wrath... when every arena comp was DK+Ret and was more faceroll than a cat versus a mouse.<br />
<br />
Seriously, most of you people crying were only going to play ret because of their damage? You're just the FotM crowd. Of course it was going to get nerfed. Stop thinking (for every spec) that some patch will make your spec 'complete'. The game is never complete, there will always be changes and tuning. The roller coaster continues... as it always has. <br />
<br />
Move along.</div></div><hr />

Well considering that rogues do considerably more damage than any other class in PvP when they're meant for control and stealth is pretty insane. 50% on some of their moves is what is needed right now. Go play a BG or world PvP and you'll see what's going on with them.</div></div><hr />

And how is this revelant? Just because ret was OP at some point in wrath it should be shit for the rest of wow? Nice logic :D Btw. rogues were gods in pvp in every expansion, same goes for mages, but when ret is good for 2 weeks, it gets quickly nerfed :D<br />

You claimed ret is &quot;finally viable in high rated pvp&quot;. <br />
Ret was op in vanilla. Especially after 1.13 when crusader strike was introduced. I remember 1 shotting MANY people with my Zin'rokh and Might of Menethil.<br />
Ret was OP at BC launch with the introduction of Avenging wrath and Crusader Strike. You could use AW and Bubble at the same time.<br />
Ret was OP at Wrath launch - already been over that.<br />
Ret was OP at Cataclysm... Zealotry... Crusader strike gave you 3 holy power for 20 seconds. AW + Zealotry OP as shit.<br />
Ret was OP in MoP and WoD - Do i really need to go into the glory days? most people do not forget.<br />
Ret was OP in Legion. &quot;Ret paladin or DH Stongest pvp class?&quot; threads. Need i say more?<br />
Ret IS OP on BfAbeta, even if they nerf the bugged DoT damage. They have the most get out of jail free abilities in the game and highly competitive damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
So WHEN was it that ret was bad?<br />

You're full of it. I played a paladin since December 2005. The weakest they EVER were was pre-1.13, before Crusader Strike, and even then had their moments with Reckoning Bombs and lucky seal of command procs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ret was so bad in WoD that even Vanguards was gave up and almost only played his shaman MoP ret was medicore with only a single viable comp which was PhP whenn both priest and hunter had better comps to run. Legion ret was good until around they time they started to nerf holy wrath and which point in turned into a bottom spec for any comp consdering how other melee like arms/frost/WW/feral utterly dominated the melee slots. In vanilla crusader strike came with the TBC pre.patch and then got the shit nerfed out of it. In tbc ret was not viable in PvP until S4 since the ret PvP gear lacked ressi aka it had 0 ressi and rets took a ridiculous amount of dmg up until then and then even in S4 ret was medicore at the best. <br />
<br />
I will give you this much ret spent a lot of WOTLK and S10/S11(cata) as top tier (and in S11 only due to x3 dps comps mainly rogue/hunt/ret).<br />
<br />
I honestly wonder if you have in any season gone beyond 1500 rating especially considering you considered ret OP in WoD/MoP also not to mention ret when it was not &quot;op&quot; spent most of its time being bottom tier not even mid tier spec.<br />
<br />
Here is also a easy way to tell how &quot;op&quot; ret has been how many blizzard tournaments have had rets in them? last I checked ret showed up in early Legion which was the first time ever it did. I am sure you will say its so &quot;easy&quot; to play but that will never explain the amount of times people brought frost dks to tournaments in the present and past.</div></div><hr />

Just because the have to talent to into Crowd control and dot to damage doesn’t justify them being god tier damage sorry but you make a weak argument. They’re next on the nerf list don’t worry</div></div><hr />

They've been high on the BG charts for some time now. Fact is they're easily killed and shutdown, have mediocre<br />
burst, and low sustained single target. I'd reckon that Fury warriors will see nerfs first. Take away the large aoe damage and Balance has very little.</div></div><hr />
