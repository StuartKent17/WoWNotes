<br />
I imagine Furnace was just a gearcheck, just like Butcher, everyone needed more gear to be able to beat it.<br />
Blackhand would have had the actual hard mechanics.</div></div><hr />

You also break through two floors when you transition from phase 1 into phase 2. Extra phase could be that other floor. I have a hard time believing a phase 4 would take place on the same platform since it gets covered in volcanoes. Guess we'll have to wait to find out.</div></div><hr />

I assume your intelligence is below average so let me make it a bit more clear for you why warlocks are &quot;complaining&quot;: Locks are getting nerfed in the upcoming patch, they are strong now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Locks aren't complaining about current status of Demo. They are complaining about current status of Destro and Affliction and the massive nerf to Demonbolt while Mages went totally unchecked and Boomkin saw a smaller nerf to Starfall. Warlocks complain merely because Destro and Affliction are sooooo far behind demo there wasn't a choice in BRF and then 6.1 they stomped on Demo instead of fixing the issue which is Secondary Power Source regen of Affliction and Destro. We all knew demonbolt would get nerfed but no one saw a 25% nerf. Also, Warlocks have had 10 changes since WoD of 20% or more no other class has even come close to that. We'd just like to not need to switch specs and play a new way every few weeks. A little consistancey would be nice. Also, Sparkuggz is one of those Locks and happens to be one of the best dps in the world...so ya...you don't sit him even if warlocks were weak; which we aren't. We just have one spec to play in BRF, and after 6.1 our best dream is to be middle of the pack to upper middle except on fights where we can number pad with tiny adds. Yet all 3 mage specs are top 10 alone with all three warrior specs and boomkins and enhancement shaman and only warrior execute saw any sort of nerf beyond the starfall nerf which is 10% less than the demonbolt nerf. Our complaints are fairly valid based on how jerked around the warlocks have been since day one of WoD.</div></div><hr />

I dunno why you're having so much trouble grasping that they were killing the boss with both their mains in the same group as their alts, so either they multiboxed (lol) or they shared their account with someone else to play their alts for them which is against the terms of service everyones agreed to.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if troll or not but: it's the fact that 2 people from method played their mains whilst someone ELSE played their alts whom they have transfered to another account.</div></div><hr />

You wouldn't want that... I was one of the members of the only guild to kill Avatus 40, and while the bosses were challenging, that wasn't the reason it took 7 months to clear.. It was bugs and roster boss issues that you had to conquer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are no mages or boomkins in that kill? Fooled me. There are no warriors, but this isn't a warrior showcase fight. I'm also not commenting on the kill itself but responding to someone who thinks warlock complaints are unjustified. We were not that out of hand on any fight except where we can abuse Cata + Chaos Wave on shitty number pad adds (Beastlord is a prime example)<br />
<br />
I'm complaining about them incorrectly &quot;fixing&quot; warlocks, but allowing mages to continue to be heads and tails above other classes and I was merely clarifying why warlocks are complaining about their current state. Also, it helps if you qualify what you are talking about instead of just using ambiguous pronouns. I can't tell if you are talking about me complaining about the state of Affliction and Destro or the fact that Mages, Boomkins and Warriors were just as powerful as Demo locks but saw little to no change in 6.1? Arms got a nerf in excute and Starfall saw a 15% nerf nowhere near the 25% demonbolt change and yet our other specs are just as lackluster as before. We'll pull through but currently we are the most jerked around class in WoD...maybe monks have it a little worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And thats not good design at all, nothing should be anywhere near that hard, thats masochism, trying the same boss over and over again for seven months, its not fun at all. Ppl kill last bosses in 1-2 weeks because thankfully for ppl that play this game for fun Blizz doesnt tune the encounters for players that play 24 hours a day, run like 10 heroic runs on week 1 and basicaly dedicate theyre lives to the game. Blizz could create a difficulty just for them, making bosses that would take Paragon/Method months to kill but I doubt anyone else would go anywhere near such a difficulty.</div></div><hr />

I don't approve of any class or spec being shit, but I find it a bit amusing warlocks would complain about their class being bad, when warlocks have had the most time on top out of any class (MoP for example, where warlocks were the best dps with pretty much the best survivability all throughout the expansion).</div></div><hr />

Doing that would create too much of a hardship for most of warcraft's playerbase. You have to remember that warcraft now is about the mini games. It doesn't take much effort to do them so why put people in a situation that they must play for no reward for that long of a stretch? I'll tell you right now most players won't and they'd just quit.</div></div><hr />

I doubt they would take away the kill, but a ban is likely to happen. We don't know all the details. Account sharing is not totally a no go as you can share your account with a minor. Blizzard would need proof i guess that this was not happening :S i dono.</div></div><hr />

He didnt necessarily account share. Fraggi might just have transfered his Druid to Kuznams account, as in a payed transfer from blizzard services. Therefore it has nothing to do with account sharing. Not sure though.</div></div><hr />

Tos section 3 says: <br />
&quot;You represent that you are an adult in your country of residence. You agree to these Terms of Use on behalf of yourself and, at your discretion, for one (1) minor child for whom you are a parent or guardian and whom you have authorized to play the Game using the license granted to you. &quot;<br />
<br />
Now i highly doubt you are a parent or a guardian to your friend.<br />
<br />
And section 6:<br />
&quot;BLIZZARD MAY SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY, OR DELETE ANY BNET ACCOUNT OR WORLD OF WARCRAFT ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU. For purposes of explanation and not limitation, most account suspensions, terminations and/or deletions are the result of violations of this Terms of Use or the EULA. &quot;<br />
<br />
Since the ToS doesnt say anything about allowing friends to play, it does say you may allow ONE minor child to use the license granted to you... you are violating the ToS since it doesnt include authorization for the customer to share his/her account with anyone but one child.<br />
It doesnt need to say anything but the limitations, you as a customer need to have the brains to understand the limitations. :P They arent giving us riddles after all, just easy to read limitations in the words of a normal person.<br />
<br />
Its an agreement, you have agreed to ONLY allow ONE minor child to play on your account.<br />
<br />
But gratz for method, now lets wait who gets the real world first without character sharing. :P</div></div><hr />

I guess you're a big Paragon fan or something? as you might know or not?? dunno if you actually pay much attention since you spout blame everywhere the last hour. GM's and Blizzard developers are actually following these events very very closly. if they saw that you were blantantly cheating you really think they would just allow it to go on for hours and days (as method probably did not just realise this and got a kill super fast).<br />

<br />
When you have a rule you almost always have to consider the intentions behind it. Thankfully Blizzard has done a really good job at describing this for everyone in that very post. It is intentionally a very broad rule that is applicable to a wide range of scenarios with an equally broad set of penalties ranging from nothing to perm ban.<br />
<br />
As described on the post, account sharing could be as simple as you allowing a friend to have his own character or two on your account. But, such a scenario could potentially lead to problems such as stealing. By having this blanket rule blizzard dissolves itself of any responsibility in this case and limits their costumer support time on this account. So, in this case the intention is not that it's disallowed, but rather; Blizzard does not want to deal with potential issues, and may shut off services like item restoration.<br />
<br />
A scenario could be as trivial as you showing off the game to a non-wow player, letting them make a new character and play through the tutorial while you show them the ropes. This is also against the account sharing rule. But, would you ever think Blizzard would be against this?<br />
<br />
Now, lets look at some of the cases the rule is intended to hit. Power-leveling services, arena boosting, account selling. This rule is intentionally broad enough to be applicable to these activities in any form they may assume. Furthermore, having this catch-all rule makes for a clear and simple banning process. They don't &quot;have&quot; to prove money transfers they just have to prove account sharing. Now &quot;have&quot; is in quotations since they can ban anyone for any or no reason without any process. They do so only because they want to preserve their image.<br />
<br />
So, how can we apply this to our current scenario of account sharing? Well, we can't. The above cases are all scenarios where this rule is applicable and blizzard has expressly stated how they will handle the case. From experience, I have heard of rare cases where players from outside of guilds have been banned from account sharing when being boosted in raids (but only when boost included account sharing) when the intention is a boost is being sold for real money. But, I have never heard of anyone being banned to lend a guild mate an alt to play on. <br />
<br />
I find it really hard to use any of the arguments from the known bannable cases on this. An account isn't being boosted to earn a reward the owner would not himself have been able to get (owner is in the raid) and nothing is being sold.<br />
<br />
I do not think this is against the rules as intended. And no one on this forum that has not broken any rule as they are written.<br />
<br />

I was hoping for a midwinter win, but as I see it, if they didn't in anyway cheat in order to cause broken mechanics, and killed him as the encounter was designed, then hell yah they're world first! and big props to them for it, its a hard fight!<br />
Who gives a crap if people buy gold or bot? If it's against Blizzards ToS then that's a stupid rule on Blizzards part. They're still getting the money from (some of) them.<br />
<br />
I agree they DID get the WF kill, but it's heavily diminished. It's obvious that if they felt they could kill it without account sharing, they would have. They didn't so they had to resort to extreme measures. Blizzard won't give half a fuck about it, but I expect anyone who plays by the rules rather than around them to do so.<br />
<br />
I expect that at most the account sharers will get a 3-day ban to &quot;satisfy&quot; the need to uphold the rules they made. Probably no removal of achieves or loot, and definitely not from the entire guild.<br />
<br />
It also doesn't matter if it's &quot;been done since forever&quot;. If you don't get caught, it can't be proven. This time around, it's fairly obvious with leaks from people on RealID and comparing achievements on the armory.<br />
<br />
Imagine Exodus if they hadn't been caught in Ulduar, or if SK Gaming was caught Iceblock bugging KJ and Nihilum would keep on being #1 until Ulduar. Entire legacies of guild changed.</div></div><hr />

If that's true Method can kiss this kill good bye because I doubt Blizzard would allow them to keep it if a different guild has had a kill removed for the exact same thing.</div></div><hr />

They won't be banned because of it, if anything the kill credit will be stripped from them and the person who owns the shared account will be suspended most likely.</div></div><hr />

The only issue is, that is not the same thing. Blizzard has repeatedly stated they are against boosting services that depend on account sharing, regardless if it's power leveling arena or raid. It's nonsensical to make an argument that Method boosted Method. You can make an argument for account sharing. But, is that enough?</div></div><hr />

In less than 24 hours they killed Mythic Ko'ragh and Imperator Mar'grok, those guys are definitely cheating. This situation needs to be investigated, it's just disrespectful to all the other guilds who are progressing on that fight.<br />
<br />
Anyone can buy a boost (account-sharing) to get a realm first without being punished? I don't think so Blizz.<br />
<br />
<br />
This situation is being investigated and, if confirmed, the appropriate actions will be taken. The reported behavior is a violation of the Terms of Use to which all players agree before entering the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know that they're all great players and everything but I'm kinda sad that those world first races are coming down to bugusing/servertrans to get BMAH equip/accountsharing and stuff like that. I think only taking FotM classes/the best class for the boss is alright, but anything more than that does kinda ruin it for me, personally. If this continues without punishments it won't matter anymore who the best player is or who got lucky. All that matters will be who is the best at bending the rules/abusing the system. :/ That's of course just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Here's the issue though, they're not on the same account. They're two WoW accounts linked to the same battlenet. If one WoW account causes a dispute or committed an offence, the account is banned in it's entirety. The battlenet account holder is held responsible for the actions of all those who use the accounts (usually minors, or siblings)<br />
<br />
Doing what that case says is...well definitely cheating since people are logging into your one singular account from more than one source. And is a clear bannable offence because it's not utilizing more than one account, it's one account, being boosted. Which is against the ToS. Absolutely.<br />
<br />
If the two accounts method used were only logged by two different people for the kill without issue, and without any suspicious circumstances surrounding it, and with authentication use, then I'm afraid shit gets a little more complex.<br />
<br />
They can claim their younger siblings/kids were granted permission to use the separately created accounts and viola. And they'd have every right, since my sibling has similar privileges. <br />
<br />
And frankly I don't want my younger sibling banned because someone spied a picture of my battle-net, noticed that and went &quot;BUT BUT BUT- CHEATING!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which uses the same login/password to login, Battlenet accounts are looked at as a whole. Example, I have 7 WoW accounts attached to my Battlenet account, if 7 different people login to those 7 accounts that's still 7 people sharing the battlenet account which is the issue.<br />
<br />
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/unauthorized-account-access-policy<br />
<br />
As minor as it may seem its essentially cheating because it could be looked at as being able to get bonus loot etc, if an alt is carried through a separate BRF lockout and obtained loot from it then is played by a different person in the main raid group that's no different than transferring to a different server and buying XYZ off the BMAH. Based on that they should also be removed from Wowprogress.<br />
<br />
To summarize - they cheated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PS. EVERY guild from top20 did share account at least once, believe me, so talking about &quot;not legit kill&quot; is just silly. People share their accounts with guildies when, for example, their alt is needed, but someone more experienced can play it better on the encounter. It happens every time (do you remember Dragon Soul and Spine? :&gt; Yep, many mages and rogues were required for kill - so how do you think guilds managed to gather like 3-4 mages and 3-4 rogues so quickly? Alts. Who played it? The most experienced players. SIMPLE.). I'm surprised people do not know this...</div></div><hr />

So let's &quot;revoke&quot; (quotes because the &quot;world first&quot; thing is created by us; they don't get prizes from blizzard for it) all world firsts that ever happened because in every top group we would find a player who once did stupid stuff with his account and did something bannable by blizzard's rules.<br />
I wouldn't even be surprised if Paragons Nef hc kill involved account sharing as well (7 geared ferals).<br />
Should the kill be legit? Yes, they showed their skill by beating the boss, they did not abuse mechanics or bugs (saronite bombs, Nef hc dmg increase pre-nerf).<br />
People are complaining either way. &quot;They are doing so many split raids to farm gear&quot; &quot;They are abusing BMAH and server transfers&quot; &quot;They are doing this/that&quot;. <br />
As long as they are not using bots/scripts or purposely abusing things, nothing what you people say will take away their accomplishment. Even if blizz bans those 2 accounts they'll laugh.

As long as they are not using bots/scripts or purposely abusing things, nothing what you people say will take away their accomplishment. Even if blizz bans those 2 accounts they'll laugh. And I can pretty much guarantee that the guild that gets the 2nd kill won't claim &quot;first&quot; after this.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure they won't be laughing when it's taken away. Pretty sure the guild that does it first without cheating will claim first and I'm pretty sure it will be recognized as such by the community.<br />

You are just bitter and jealous.<br />

The fact is that Method are the best players in the world and no amount of LFR noobs crying will change that fact.<br />

Seems like you're mad that your heroes cheated and aren't being praised. Sounds like a personal problem.</div></div><hr />

Bitter and jealous? please get over yourself.

Are you saying a character with better gear isn't a buff? I'm pretty damn sure Method is saying that which is why they couldn't kill it with everyone playing their own account but were able to once they shared.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it entirely possible that the alt that was shared has loot from an alt run giving it a loot advantage over other guilds, albeit a super minute advantage its still blatantly cheating, its essentially like transferring to a different server to buy gear off the BMAH then transferring back again (which I might add wowprogress forbids/threatens to remove guilds from its progress tables if they do because they classify it as cheating), doesn't matter what guild does it at the end of the day, if someone does that then shares the account for main raid use its a form of cheating.</div></div><hr />

The controversy here should at least provoke a blizz statement wihtin a day or two. Let's all just wait and see beofre we start pointing fingers, and the race should continue imo till we here officially whether or not what occurred was officially legit or not. I probably won't care either way 2 minutes after its declared, but its still important for the sake of the race. Curiosity more than anything. The one thing I'll say is that if this is technically an exploit it should have already, could have, and needs to be prevented by the game, otherwise this will be the president set for future races and you'll see alot more than 2 chars xferred or w/e is being accused.</div></div><hr />

That is stretching a bit far. I'm sure as much as he was geared other people would have gear a long the same lines. Still isn't cheating unless there is an Ilvl barricade for who can get world first or not.<br />

5 ilevel difference and better trinkets. They thought it was a big enough difference to risk being banned for. It obviously was since they got the kill after finally switching. Look I don't care which guild gets world first, it doesn't affect my daily life at all. But they cheated, the kill has been tainted, they broke the TOU and that's that. At this point I really don't give a shit, I'm just curious how Blizzard is going to react. They have banned another guild recently for the same thing and removed a kill. They also banned two high profile pvp twitch players recently so it would be really weird for them to let this slide.</div></div><hr />

So in a game based around having better gear to kill things easier, someone having better gear is cheating? I still don't see why it is cheating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the player playing that character with better gear didn't own the account the character was on. It was account sharing which is against the TOU that everyone agrees to and is a bannable offense. They're trying to pass it off as it's no big deal, that &quot;the guild owns all the accounts&quot; which is laughable. They're going to find out soon Blizzard are the ones that own the account, not the guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there is no advantage to doing it, none whatsoever, then why do it at all? Especially knowing it's against the ToS? Why could the people piloting the extra toons not have just participated in the kill on their own toons using their own accounts?<br />
<br />
Because there was an advantage to doing it. And doing something against the rules for an advantage is what people call &quot;cheating&quot;. <br />
<br />
That toon with the gear it had was a better choice for the fight than the pilots own toons with their own gear. This is pretty simple.</div></div><hr />

Only Method players and only Method guild characters participated in the kill. They did the kill strictly within the guild.<br />
<br />
Thread closed.<br />
<br />
They cheated in order to get faster/better geared alt classes. They had to spend less time farming gear. They had to rely less on RNG. <br />
<br />
<br />
This &quot;News&quot; post should be taken down; Mythic blackhand has not been killed legit yet, and people will be banned for this.<br />

<br />
If that's true Method can kiss this kill good bye because I doubt Blizzard would allow them to keep it if a different guild has had a kill removed for the exact same thing.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't doubt it if they let them keep it just so they could try to nip the drama in the bud.</div></div><hr />

but nothing you have said points it out as cheating. It is people using Characters which have gained all the gear IN-GAME legitimately, in a world first kill. The person who plays the character is irrelevant. Even if it is against the ToS it still isn't cheating. Just like Swearing is against the ToS, I could yell &quot;fuck fuck fuck&quot; the entire time the final boss was getting killed, would be bannable but not cheating.<br />
<br />
There is literally no cheating though.<br />

It is still not cheating though, unless they hacked the game and gave themselves the items they still ACQUIRED EVERYTHING by playing the game.<br />
You really think the other top guilds don't do the exact same thing? Or is it only bad when the top guild isn't American (again)</div></div><hr />

I was &quot;Cheering' for paragon in this, with danish terrace as my favorite guild at the moment because they streamed :) Has nothing to do with US or EU.<br />
<br />
I hope you are aware the breaking rules IS cheating. They DID get an advantage, they spent less time gearing, and the RNG gods would have a much higher chance of getting the important classes/specs gear.<br />
<br />
That is a blatant cheating of the rules for an advantage.</div></div><hr />

It's clearly cheating. Otherwise they would have had to gear up an entirely new person in order to fill that slot. They did not want to spend the time doing this, so they resorted to cheating to allow another player to use an already geared toon that was owned by another person.</div></div><hr />
