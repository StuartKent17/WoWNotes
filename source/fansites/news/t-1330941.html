Coffee with the Devs: Dissecting Patch 5.4 Class Changes<br />
Yeah, I know, long time no coffee table. I’ve been busy.<br />
<br />
I wanted to take a moment to provide context for some of the Patch 5.4 class changes that we’ve been making. If you haven’t already, you’ll want to get acquainted with the 5.4 PTR Patch Notes, as this watercooler is going into detail on the changes listed. I’ll discuss the changes to each class, but here are a few things to keep in mind before we get started:<br />
<br />
<br />
The team made a lot of changes to glyphs that weren’t working out well or were just to provide some new choices. There were a lot of changes so to keep this blog manageable, I’m not going to go into them in detail.<br />
I’m not going to get into specific damage or healing tuning unless it requires extra explanation for some reason. In general, you can assume that your damage was too low or too high if you see generic buffs or nerfs to abilities.<br />
As I write this, Patch 5.4 has not shipped yet, so if there are changes yet to come, I’m obviously not going to be able to cover them!<br />
<br />
<br />
One final caveat: please don’t consider the number of changes or the size of the paragraphs as an indication of the degree to which we love or hate your class. When players start weighing the number of words we use on each class, the end result is just to make us less likely to want to engage in discussions like this. Paladins and Hunters have a lot of words below because their changes are fairly complex and I felt they required more explanations than other classes.<br />
<br />
With all that in mind, here we go!<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
Most of our core changes were to Blood DKs. We added the Riposte passive to DKs (and Warriors) to allow them to increase their damage using the avoidance stats that naturally occur on their tanking gear. We also removed the Runic Power cost of Dancing Rune Weapon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/49028) to allow it to be used more as a cooldown when needed. Finally, we changed Scent of Blood (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/49509) to also be proc’d by avoidance, to make sure avoidance stats can help provide more active mitigation.<br />
<br />
In terms of DK talents, as with all the classes, our primary goal was to open up some more talent choices and address some underpowered talents. While Anti-Magic Zone (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/51052) was capable of mitigating a lot of damage when used at precisely the right time, it was also easy to not gain the full benefit of the cooldown. We changed it to just be damage reduction similar to Power Word: Barrier (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/62618). We also buffed Death Siphon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108196) and Plague Leech (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/123693), which were underutilized.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s))<br />
We buffed Guardian spec Stamina outright because we felt the spec needed it. Druids have less reliable damage reduction, which isn’t a problem itself, so long as they have the health pool to compensate for it. For Feral Druids, we reverted an earlier nerf to Cyclone (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33786)’s cooldown but removed Cyclone (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33786) from Predatory Swiftness (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/16974). We felt like this ability had become a PvP problem that was too unpredictable to counter. We also lowered the PvP duration of Faerie Fire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/770) to make it less of a hard counter to stealthed players. We changed Innervate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29166) to scale with Spirit so it would scale with gear better. We also made a few changes to the Restoration healing toolkit. Our change to Efflorescence is an attempt to get Swiftmend (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/18562) back to its original design of being a potent single-target heal. We’re making that change slowly by having the 5.4 Efflorescence glyph move the ground heal from Swiftmend (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/18562) to Wild Mushroom (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/88747). We further tweaked Wild Mushroom (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/88747) for Restoration by limiting it to a single mushroom.<br />
<br />
We had several specs whose passive damage reduction we felt was starting to cause balance problems, and Balance’s Moonkin Form (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/24858) was among these. Originally we converted the physical damage reduction to spell damage reduction at a time when the spec needed a PvP buff, but we felt like the fact that Balance required less healing in PvE was causing raids to favor them over other casters.<br />
<br />
Most of the changes to Druid talents were because of the situation where certain specs leaned heavily on certain talents in a row and tended to ignore the others—Dream of Cenarius (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108373), Force of Nature (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/37846), Nature’s Vigil, and Soul of the Forest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114107) fall into this category. We changed Nature’s Swiftness to be a core Restoration ability because we felt the healers were dependent upon it. We replaced it with a new passive talent, Ysera’s Gift.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
We had three main issues we wanted to resolve for Hunters this patch: Silencing Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/34490), Readiness (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/23989), and Stampede (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121818).<br />
<br />
The problem with Silencing Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/34490) is it’s just too powerful as a talent. No self-respecting Hunter is going to choose any talent but Silencing Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/34490), especially in PvP, but in PvE as well. At the same time, we think Hunters, especially Beast Mastery, have proven really powerful in PvP this expansion—and frankly the game has too many blanket Silence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/15487) already, so we didn’t want to just give Silencing Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/34490) to all Hunters. Our decision was to give Silencing Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/34490) to Marksman, who needed a PvP buff anyway. We did give all Hunters a base interrupt with the new Counter Shot, which can interrupt a spell being cast, but can’t pre-Silence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/15487) a caster.<br />
<br />
Readiness (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/23989) has been another problematic ability for us to solve. It started as a talent, but was too good compared to the other choices. We ended up giving Readiness (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/23989) to all Hunters, but we were never happy with this implementation. For PvP, it made Hunters really difficult to balance with the ability to reset so many offensive and defensive abilities. For PvE, we felt like Readiness (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/23989) wasn’t doing anything interesting besides making the opening attack sequence twice as complicated as it needed to be. If Readiness (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/23989) was an ability that a clever Hunter would bust out at a clutch moment, then you could argue it would be an interesting ability, but of course it was never actually used that way. Given that Hunters already have a lot of cooldowns, situational abilities, and just buttons in general, we didn’t think Readiness (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/23989) was worth saving. We did make small buffs to Deterrence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19263) and Disengage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/781) and we will make sure DPS is where it needs to be (which, if I had to guess, will be relatively higher than it was in Patch 5.3).<br />
<br />
We felt like Stampede (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121818) had been nerfed too much in PvE for PvP reasons. It’s the intent that Stampede (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121818) is a potent cooldown for Hunters, so we increased its damage back to an exciting level and just had it do less damage in PvP. Finally, we made a change that some (though to be fair not all) Survival Hunters had asked for a long time, to remove Explosive Trap (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13813) from Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343) (and therefore from the shared cooldown with Black Arrow (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/3674)) so that they could use Explosive Trap (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13813) (typically with the knockback glyph) without interfering with Black Arrow (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/3674)/Lock and Load (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56343).<br />
<br />
Hunter talents were in a pretty good spot overall after a bit of iteration throughout MoP. We did nerf Aspect of the Iron Hawk (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109260), because as with Shadow Priests and Balance Druids, we felt like the damage reduction was just too potent. We changed Narrow Escape (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109298) to be dispellable as a PvP nerf. We buffed Spirit Bond (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109212), which has felt particularly weak, and we buffed A Murder of Crows (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/131894).<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br />
We didn’t think Mages needed many changes overall. One goal of ours was to fix Frost Mastery, which we felt was increasingly making them difficult to tune in PvP. When you take a spec with high burst and good control and then give them Mastery that links the two together, you’re bound to have trouble. The new Mastery, called Icicles, spreads the burst out over a few seconds but in a novel way that doesn’t feel too similar to, say, Ignite. As a consequence, we removed the mechanic where Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) buffs other spells and just let those spells do higher damage to begin with. As of this writing, we haven’t made any mechanical changes to Fire, though if you saw any earlier patch notes, we experimented with a few. Long term, we still have concerns about the interplay between Alter Time (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108978) and Combustion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/11129), and we still have concerns about Fire scaling with Critical Strike, but we’re not convinced either of these problems is so egregious that it needs to be fixed in Patch 5.4.<br />
<br />
In terms of talents, we increased the damage of the bomb tier, and buffed Ice Flows and Temporal Shield (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115610), which were underutilized. Long term, we still think the level-90 tier needs some work, but we were concerned that attempting to replace two or three of these talents for Patch 5.4 would lead to a lot more iteration before they felt good again. But we did ease the restrictions on Rune of Power (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116011). Since it didn’t feel like a crisis, we think more dramatic change is better saved for an expansion, when we have more time to consider new visuals, test, and get feedback.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
Earlier in the PTR cycle, we attempted to solve Mistweaver mana problems, by which I mean Mistweavers didn’t have to stack Spirit to the extent other healers did. We became concerned that it would take quite a number of changes to solve this problem, resulting in a lot of relearning for players, so we agreed to accept the current status quo and balance Mistweavers around the fact that they have less Spirit (and therefore more of other secondary stats) compared to other healers. For Windwalkers, we redesigned their Mastery (yet again) and buffed the Storm, Earth, and Fire ability so that the Cleave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/845) aspect of the cooldown would feel really potent. <br />
<br />
Brewmasters were in pretty good shape, but we did feel like Keg Smash (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121253) made their damage too high compared to other tanks.<br />
<br />
Several Monk talents were underpowered or difficult to use. We buffed Chi Brew (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115399), Zen Sphere (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124081), Power Strikes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121817), and Healing Elixirs (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/122280). We made Xuen easier to control by providing him with a true pet bar. We changed Chi Burst (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/130651) to require no target. Ring of Peace has a better visual that’s more representative of the affected area, and we tweaked its numbers. We didn’t think we could solve Rushing Jade Wind (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116847)’s problems, namely that it was too similar to Chi Burst (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/130651), so we redesigned it as a replacement for Spinning Crane Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/107270).<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
Most of our core changes were to Holy Paladins. Specifically, we felt like the healing style of blanketing a group with Eternal Flame (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114163) to proc absorbs from Illuminate Healing had become too widespread, and didn’t fit the healing style we wanted for Paladins. When some Paladins choose to use a heal-over-time spell, that’s the kind of diversity we want the talent tree to deliver. However, when every Paladin uses heal over time spells, then it’s just the way Paladins work.<br />
<br />
In this case, we didn’t want to make Eternal Flame (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114163) a core ability. Unlike Restoration Druids, Mistweaver Monks, and to a lesser extent Holy Priests, we don’t think every Paladin should be extensively using heal-over-time spells. The only change we made was to have Eternal Flame (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114163)’s periodic heal not proc the Illuminated Healing absorb. It can still be used the way any HoT is used, to provide a buffer that can be layered with other heals, but it will no longer be an efficient way to blanket many targets with long-lasting absorbs. We made significant changes to Sacred Shield (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20925) and Selfless Healer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85804) as well to help offset this nerf, which I’ll discuss below.<br />
<br />
We also felt like Seal of Insight (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20165) had a design problem. When Holy Paladins could melee targets, they had no mana problems at all, but when they had to heal at range (which we wanted to at least be an option, if not the default healing style), they suffered for mana. We thought it best to unshackle Holy Paladins from the pressure of having to stand in melee, so we removed the mana return from Seal of Insight (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20165) and buffed Divine Plea (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/54428). We had to provide more mana to Protection Paladins as well, since they typically tank using Seal of Insight (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20165). We also buffed Guardian of Ancient Kings (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/86698) for Holy, because we felt like it was too focused on single-target healing at a time when most healers are required to do a lot of area healing. Finally, we allowed the Sanctity of Battle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/25956) passive to also affect Holy Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/25912), with the intent of making Haste slightly better for Holy.<br />
<br />
Aside from the mana buff mentioned above, we changed Crusader Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/35395) to also provide Weakened Blows as a quality of life improvement. We also changed Grand Crusader (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85043) to proc from avoidance instead of attacks. We aren’t trying to make Dodge or Parry a Paladin’s best tanking stats, but those stats are going to appear on tanking gear, so we want to make sure they can tie into active mitigation. We’re happy with how active mitigation is working out overall and we want to put even more emphasis on it, for all tanks, in the future.<br />
<br />
Retribution didn’t need much attention overall in our minds, but we did make Inquisition (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/84963) require less maintenance overall, and we reduced the cooldown and strength of Guardian of Ancient Kings (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/86698), so that Retribution could use the cooldown more frequently. Retribution players had concerns that their damage was too tied to long cooldowns.<br />
<br />
For Paladin talents, we tried to improve Selfless Healer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85804) for Holy by allowing Judgment (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20271) to provide Holy Power, and we tried to improve Sacred Shield (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20925) by removing the target cap and having a cooldown and charges instead. We’ve come to the conclusion that the same talent choices for healers and other specs just won’t always work, which is why you increasingly see talents work slightly different for healers in the case of Paladins, Priests, and Druids in particular. We replaced Burden of Guilt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/110301) as a talent (and made it a slightly weaker glyph) with the ability to use Turn Evil (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/10326) on players. We hope that this will open up some PvP comp choices for Paladins, since Fear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5782) are not always easy to get. We buffed Hand of Purity (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114039) so that it will still have some benefit on boss abilities that can’t be prevented from immunities. We buffed Sanctified Wrath (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53376) for Holy and Protection. We also simplified Unbreakable Spirit (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114154) by just having it apply the cooldown all the time rather than having to be “driven down.”<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br />
We made a few changes to each Priest specialization. For Discipline, while we don’t think the shields, Atonement (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/81749), or potent cooldowns are overpowered individually, we felt that having all three in one spec gave them too much Versatility (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114013) compared to the other healers. We know Atonement (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/81749) is fun, and while it’s useful, it doesn’t truly compete with a dedicated healer or DPS, so we think it’s in a good spot. We like Discipline to have a strong shield kit, and we’re happy to see more Power Word: Shield (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/17) use in 5.2 than in 5.0. That left the cooldowns as targets, and we felt like Spirit Shell (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109964) was the right one to nerf. We also felt like Rapture (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/47536) scaling so well with Spirit turned what was originally supposed to be a mechanic offering a discount on Power Word: Shield (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/17) to reward smart use had instead become a bona fide mana regeneration mechanic. For Holy, we buffed Sanctuary (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/105805) and Serendipity (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/63733) to help keep Holy in mana a little longer. We also finally gave in and reversed Lightwell (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/724) and Lightspring, so that the more passive (and popular) totem-like use of the spell became the default. We reduced the damage reduction of Shadowform (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/15473) as we did for Hunters and Balance Druids, because we felt like it offered too much of a passive benefit. We also completely rebuilt Shadowy Apparitions (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/78203) so that it keeps the kit of a delayed source of damage, but won’t get stuck on terrain or objects or struggle with bosses that move or fly.<br />
<br />
For Priest talents, we are trying one more time to make Angelic Feather (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121536) compete with the other movement talents, and let Mindbender (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/123040) and From Darkness, Comes Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109186) compete better with Solace and Insanity. We also buffed Divine Insight (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109175) for Discipline and Twist of Fate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109142) for all three specs.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Q))<br />
We buffed Evasion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5277) for Rogues outright to increase their survivability against melee. We also buffed Recuperate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/73651) because we agree that it went from being a potent heal in Cataclysm to a more middling one in MoP. The other core changes were really focused on Combat. We increased the cost and damage of Sinister Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1752) in order to help address Rogues having too much energy with high Haste values, which led to a spammy, RSI-inducing style. (It’s fine for Combat to feel fast-paced, but it had gotten out of control.) To offset the loss of combo points from less frequent Sinister Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1752), we added (or returned, depending on your point of view) the Ruthlessness passive. The other Combat change was to redesign the targeting system of Killing Spree (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/51690). Killing Spree (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/51690) now hits a single target if used without Blade Flurry (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13877). During Blade Flurry (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13877), it continues to work as it does on live.<br />
<br />
For talents, we were worried in previous patches that we had overbuffed Burst of Speed (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108212), but clearly that is not yet the case, so we lowered its cost. We buffed the numbers on Cheat Death (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31230), Cloak and Dagger, Night Stalker, Paralytic Poison (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108215), and Shadowstep (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/36554), since they were seeing less use than other talents.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#c))<br />
We’re happy with Enhancement and Elemental performance overall, but we are keeping an eye on their burst in PvP. We did feel that Restoration wasn’t really delivering on healing when grouped and stationary, which should be a Shaman’s strength. To remedy that, we changed Chain Heal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1064) to no longer decrease effectiveness per jump and buffed Healing Rain (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/73920)’s radius and healing. We also gave Healing Tide Totem (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108280) to all Shaman, because we felt like Restoration was never going to choose another talent so long as they had the option to choose a group healing cooldown.<br />
<br />
With Shaman talents, we still had the problem that some talents were only attractive to some specializations. We buffed Astral Shift (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108271), Stone Bulwark Totem (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108270), and Unleashed Fury (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/117012) for this reason. We had to replace Healing Tide Totem (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108280), so we introduced Rushing Streams, which allows Healing Stream Totem (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5394) to heal two targets at once. We redesigned Conductivity (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108282) to make it more useful for all Shaman by having it increase the duration of Healing Rain (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/73920), saving GCDs (global cooldowns). We were convinced that Totemic Restoration (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108284) was just a problematic talent. It saw little use in PvE, but was really annoying to deal with in PvP, since a Shaman could just drop totems for a split second and benefit from their effects. The replacement talent, Totemic Persistence, allows Shaman to summon a second Water, Earth, or Air totem without destroying the first one. (Including Fire Totems would have been a non-trivial DPS increase, making this the only talent attractive to Elemental or Enhancement.)<br />

Because Warlocks had so many changes coming into Mists of Pandaria, we had to iterate on a lot of these new mechanics throughout the expansion and tried to not change things too much for Patch 5.4. We did nerf Fel Armor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/104938) for the same reasons we lowered the passive damage reduction of Balance Druids, Shadow Priests, and Hunters. We increased Fel Flame (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/77799)’s damage but removed its DoT extension, which had become a liability for Fel Flame (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/77799) in PvE rather than letting it provide damage on the move as it was intended. For Affliction, we shifted more damage to DoTs and away from Malefic Grasp (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/103103). Malefic Grasp (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/103103) is a cool spell, and we like channeling it to increase DoT damage, but we felt like too much damage had been shifted away from DoTs, which hurt Affliction in PvP and made all Affliction locks have difficulty moving. We also simplified the Soul Swap (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/86121) mechanic slightly by removing the glyph and the initial damage component. For Destruction, we changed Rain of Fire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5740) to not be so essential to the single-target rotation by reducing its Ember generation. We made Howl of Terror (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5484) baseline for all Warlocks because we thought they had lost too much of their Fear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5782)-based control package.<br />
<br />
Our biggest challenge with Warlock talents was the level-90 tier, where most Warlocks chose Kil’jaeden’s Cunning (often to the frustration of raid leaders forced to deal with Slow (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/31589)-moving Warlocks). We removed the snare from KJC but reduced the number of spells it affected. The talent should help with movement but not guarantee characters never need to stop moving. We buffed Mannoroth’s Fury by allowing it to increase the damage as well as radius of area-effect spells, but on a cooldown so the Warlock has more control over the effect and so it’ll feel more potent when active. We decided we could not safely balance Archimonde’s Vengeance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/84839) in its “damage reflection” kit, so we redesigned and renamed the talent to emphasize the Dark Soul (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/77801) cooldowns (with the intent that one talent needed to be attractive in fights with no movement or area damage).<br />
<br />
In addition to these substantial changes to the level-90 row, we wanted to buff several unattractive talents. Harvest Life (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108371) never had a strong niche, so we made it improve Drain Life (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/689) rather than act as an area-effect Drain Life (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/689). We replaced Howl of Terror (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5484) (now baseline) with a talent inspired by the Cataclysm version of Shadowflame that many players asked for. Demonic Breath is a cone-based snare. Soul Link (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108415) was also returned to an older design which is easier to use and more powerful.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E))<br />
Most of our Warrior changes were to increase Protection Warrior damage, try to improve the area-effect and Cleave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/845) damage of Arms, or to address PvP quality-of-life issues. Buffing Blood and Thunder (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/84615) helped both Arms and Protection. Changing Enrage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/13046) and Ultimatum (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/122509) for Protection Warriors provided both more damage and active mitigation by making Critical Strike a more valuable stat. We don’t expect Prot to heavily stack crit, but they’re going to have some anyway just from core stats and group buffs, and it does open up the possibility of using crit gear. We also gave Protection the same Riposte ability we gave to Death Knights, to make sure the avoidance stats that do show up on tank gear provide some active mitigation.<br />
<br />
For Arms, we reduced the cost of Thunder Clap (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115799), buffed Sweeping Strikes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/12328), and gave Slam (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1464) a Cleave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/845) ability. We didn’t think Fury needed much attention overall, though we did change the animation system to allow them to dual-wield polearms. For the PvP changes, we reduced the cost of Shattering Throw (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/64382), gave the Safeguard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114029) root break to Intervene (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/3411) baseline, took Hamstring (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1715) off the global cooldown, and reduced the cooldown of swapping stances. We also made a change to allow Shield Wall (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/871) and Spell Reflect to not require a shield to be equipped, but to still provide the visual cue that a Warrior was using these abilities by having a shield visually appear even if one was not technically equipped.<br />
<br />
For Warrior talent changes, we buffed Bladestorm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/46924), Enraged Regeneration (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/55694), Impending Victory (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/103840), Storm Bolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/107570), Vigilance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114030), and Warbringer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/103828) in addition to the Safeguard (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114029) change mentioned above to open some more choices for Warriors, especially in PvP. We understand that Shockwave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/46968) is hard to live without in PvP, but we didn’t think that was easily fixable without nerfing Shockwave (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/46968)—and probably speaks more for to the relative strength of stuns compared to other forms of crowd control, which is something we’d like to address long term. (Perhaps stuns need to be shorter, dispellable, or break on damage so they aren’t quite so game-changing.)<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts<br />
So there you have it. Hopefully you now have a little more insight into why we’re making the changes we’re making. I know it can feel like the developers are out to punish players sometimes, but really our primary goal is to keep everyone having fun. That includes redesigning awkward mechanics and buffing weak spells, but it also means nerfing overpowered mechanics so that other classes or specs don’t feel as if they can’t compete. We made a lot of talent and glyph changes because we want to deliver on the promise that players have a lot of choices in both of those systems. I won’t pretend that we’ll get everything perfect this time around either, but we should be closer. Please keep providing us with specific, constructive feedback. We still have time to respond to feedback, even after the patch launches.<br />
<br />
As far as coffee with the devs go, I will personally try to get back to releasing them more frequently than I have over the past few months. No promises, but the one I am thinking of now is my own personal preemptive post-mortem of Mists of Pandaria. We’re very proud of the expansion overall, but we’re also our own harshest critics.<br />

Pretty much been dodging 99% of the issues I see commonly recurring although dots and affliction did hit the spot at the very least. At least they're attempting to talk though I suppose<br />
<br />
This is pointless to say but mage level 90 talents have been complained about since beta, I have no idea why an entire expansion will go by before all that feedback really kicks in. An entire expansion didn't seem like a good amount of time to iterate on them rather than toss a band aid fix here and there? That wasn't constructive to say at all but really? I'm curious why it took this long to come to that conclusion. I should've known it would be just like Improved Soul Fire</div></div><hr />

we still have concerns about Fire scaling with Critical Strike, but we’re not convinced either of these problems is so egregious that it needs to be fixed in Patch 5.4.<br />
<br />
HAHAHAHAH<br />
<br />
Meanwhile,<br />
<br />
<br />
but we felt like the fact that Balance required less healing in PvE was causing raids to favor them over other casters.<br />
<br />
LOOL<br />
<br />
What is there even to say? Also on this note, Rogues require about 5000% less healing than anyone other than live Warlocks, yet... nothing of their survival was taken away. Feint alone is more powerful than any other class other than live Warlock and that is plain Feint without glyph or talent.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to know this myself - I'm assuming around mid September to be honest giving GC stated we have at least another 2 PTR builds on the way. However, I personally am hoping for mid/late October since we skipped so many weeks on heroic progression (currently 10/13 Heroic) that I'd hate for us to be on the final hour again for a shot at both Cutting Edge achievements for this tier. I know we are more than capable of doing this and could have done this sooner (our average iLevel is around 542+) but here is to hoping we are in ToT for just a lil' bit longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be the devil's advocate, they won't be doing any major class changes until the next expansion. It does, however, bother me that they refuse to acknowledge balance issues for several classes and specs but pick away at other, more minor class issues. <br />
<br />
Just feels like fluff.</div></div><hr />

Class design taken as a whole has been MoP's weakest point by far. Even the people happy with their spec/class chosen iteration have large and relevant concerns. It was expected going into the expansion but with some specs or even classes actually getting changes for the worse going into the last raiding tier of the addon then I think we can only assume that there is some large disconnect going on between the design team and the actual game. However they do there number passes, it's just plain wrong.</div></div><hr />

Because this post didn't have to do with &quot;he's too high&quot; or &quot;they're too low.&quot; It was just explaining mechanics changes that have been made that will influence the numbers pass.<br />

<br />
What does flame orb have to do with AoE? The explosion did practically zero damage and caused more harm than good.<br />
In fact, Flame Orb was just a terrible fire and forget spell in general. It was a pain in the ass to use on many bosses, and was otherwise a fire-and-forget spell that added nothing to the spec.<br />
Only thing it was good for really was upsetting rogues and people trying to drink in PvP.<br />
<br />
I do miss Blast Wave, though. Either iteration would be nice. Not that it matters, I'll probably be playing Arcane next patch on my mage~<br />

Probably for Frost 2h/DW to be more stable since having a crappy proc rate on KM/Rime kills our DPS. We had a frost DK in an alt group go unholy just because of this. Nothing aggravated him more than pulling 250K+ one night on Twins, then the next week idle at around 120K just because of procs.<br />
<br />
He reforged and respecced for Unholy...and does way more damage without even trying now. Think he topped out near 320k just this past week.</div></div><hr />

Frost 2H and Frost DW play differently enough that they could almost be considered a different spec. I believe this is what that person meant, since all three are sitting at the bottom of SimCraft for 522 and BiS.</div></div><hr />

That is because you don't know the history of Disc in this expansion, you don't understand what he means. However you don't even read what he said. Changes:<br />
<br />
- Nerf PW:S Mana gain from Rapture<br />
- Nerf SS uptime<br />
<br />
You many think that is not enough, maybe, but only pallys and disc are being nerfed this patch (overall), the rest are buffed, that means they are closer to balance, maybe they overshoot (pallys) will see. In any case this is a discussion about the mechanics, from the mechanics points of view developers didn't find one mechanic as guilty, the number tuning hasn't even started in PTR.</div></div><hr />

Because they have done a piss poor job of balance this xpac. <br />
Maybe because they have taken so much signature and uniqueness from classes/specs.<br />
Their overall design direction and quality of the current and past expansion (MoP &amp; Cata) are reflected by their sub numbers ( near a 4 million drop since the end of Lich King ). <br />

If by 'unfriendliness' you mean not having decked out alts asap, then yes. As a former hardcore (full naxx pre-bc) and a now not grazing hardcore, I think non lfr rewards is something the game needs.

<br />
Wow thanks.<br />
<br />
You do realize that the ´alt-unfriedliness´ of MOP is actually a good thing, it means our mains have actual content to do. WOTLK was very alt-friendly ONLY because by wednesday, almost everyone was done with their mains for the week. It is the same reason I have like 100 heirlooms all over my bank, because there was nothing for mains to do.<br />
<br />
I have 11-90s at this point, but I am more than happy that I got to play my main the majority of the time.<br />
<br />
There have been a ton of alt-friendly things added to MoP.. the whole commendations things for reps., the rep-drop items from warscouts, But for me, the biggest thing was those blue boe weapons that dropped from the rare spawns or just as rare drops from quest mobs. Almost all of my alts STARTED questing in MoP with an ilvl above 410, and almost all of them had a 450 or 463 blue weapon before doing a single quest.<br />
<br />
It is stupid to want your 5 level 90s to all be clearing TOT right now.. the only way that would have been possible is if there was so little for our mains to do that we sat them early in the week. I would much rather have a lot of content for my main rather than having a little content, and doing it 10 times.</div></div><hr />

I'm curious why it took this long to come to that conclusion. I should've known it would be just like Improved Soul Fire<br />
<br />
They know, but no one is getting benched because of the talents nor is anyone QQing about it in PVP. So they aren't &quot;urgent&quot; to Blizzard. <br />

The mage lvl 90 are retarded, but fixing them is mostly a QoL improvement. They should be fixed still, definitely, but blizzard thinks it can wait. <br />

<br />
I want you to read your comment about combat rogues again, and think really hard, and then start your post over about how bad class balance has been this expansion...<br />
<br />
Also, I have to laugh about your ´dk badass´.. do people really think that ANYONE thought you were badass because you were a DK. IMHO, during WOTLK especially, DKs were basically the new huntards.<br />
<br />
Class balance is never as bad as people think it is, and was never as good as people remember it was. The fact is that every expansion adds a ton of spells and talents, but most importantly, the current tier of bosses changes. A lot of the ´imbalances´ for hardcore raiding have more to do with maybe a certain boss mechanisms being over-emphasized on multiple bosses, or something to that affect. An OP spec suddenly becomes ´muddled´ for no reason other than the new tier of bosses dont´favor it´s playstyle. I think once you get outside of the top 100 guilds in the world, there are very few specs where you would be forced to respec or change classes because of dps. People are not 1% wiping and saying ´oh, if only that frost dk had been unholy´.. <br />
<br />
People need to remember that in Vanilla, and even into BC, there was sometimes a 50% delta in spec dps. A moonkin, or frost mage were lucky if they could do half the dps of a warlock. Arms and Fury warriors? Enchancent shaman.. yeah.. half the dps as a combat rogue. What we see now is most specs within 8% of the average dps, and it varies greatly by boss.<br />
<br />
But you are right, the game was more balanced when combat rogues were the only option.......</div></div><hr />

What does a Hardcore need alt gear for? <br />
<br />
Aren't Heirlooms designed as hand me downs for alts? And don't most Hardcores [poop] on casual players. Many casuals LFR for their welfare epics and then move on to an alt. By putting Heirlooms in LFR the Casuals get gear for their alts and then they can go PVE on their alts to their hearts' content. Blizzard gets to keep subs as the new welfare heirlooms will keep the casuals playing longer. And the Hardcores can keep spitting on people that wear the XP bonus gear. You can't get into a raid (even LFR) with heirloom gear, it has an ilevel of &quot;1&quot;.<br />
<br />
Let the casuals have their Heirlooms. The Harcores will continue to [poop] on you and you will never see anything but LFR but at least you'll have fun leveling alt after all, keeping your subscription and making Blizzard money. Hardcores, you just hang with your guild and get your alt runs in. The DKP that you've earned in your progressions runs will be more than enough for you to get free gear in the non-LFR raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then why in the hell do we have plate armor and shields???? If they dont want us to wade into combat, change our armor to mail, or even cloth, so we are not stuck being the only users of int plate that has no purpose....<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of our core changes were to Holy Paladins. Specifically, we felt like the healing style of blanketing a group with Eternal Flame to proc absorbs from Illuminate Healing had become too widespread, and didn’t fit the healing style we wanted for Paladins.&quot;<br />
<br />
What IS the healing style they want then? I loved being a tank healer, why was that bad? Is it really so wrong to have us be healers that go toe to toe with the foe while healing the melee around us?<br />

<br />
His comment is valid. Resto shammies get mana back for using lightning to attack while healing. Pallies used to get mana back while meleeing in the thick of things. What was wrong with his logic? If they want pallies to hang back and just ranged heal, then we would see Pallies in cloth like back in Vanilla. He was only asking for clarification as to how the Devs want pallies to play. If they could tell us straight up how Pally healers should play, people might be upset and move onto a different class or they would bend over and play the way the Devs want.</div></div><hr />

How so? So far you cant use them till 90. They will be more alt friendly the next expack but its not really alt friendly for this expack. If they where alt friendly for MOP the level would be set at level 85 or lower not max level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they make ridiculously minor changes each patch, usually in regard to only one spec. the devs dont care about balance, plain and simple; they are literally only changing things based on census data- not on player feedback. these are the laziest game developers on the planet.<br />

and if you play a melee and you're not a rogue, you're screwed.</div></div><hr />

WOTLK was very alt-friendly ONLY because by wednesday, almost everyone was done with their mains for the week. It is the same reason I have like 100 heirlooms all over my bank, because there was nothing for mains to do.<br />
<br />
You assume that everyone who play an alt is because he has nothing else to do with his main but that is wrong. Many people, me among them, play alts because they like the classes and have fun playing them. I have 8 90s and none of them is main. I like them all equally and play them all equally. <br />
<br />
<br />
It is stupid to want your 5 level 90s to all be clearing TOT right now.. the only way that would have been possible is if there was so little for our mains to do that we sat them early in the week. I would much rather have a lot of content for my main rather than having a little content, and doing it 10 times.<br />
<br />
Why is stupid?And why should everyone prefer to have lot of content for a main and no time for alts?Many people prefer to have time to play all their characters. And by saying lot of content for &quot;main&quot;, you mean lot of dailies right?because this is what Blizzard added in MoP as more content for mains. No thanks, I prefer to play my &quot;alts&quot; than doing dailies on &quot;main&quot;. I think Blizzard understood this and thats why they dropped dailies and also added much more BOA items(in the new island also there are boa epic drops).<br />
<br />
So TL;DR, not everyone play the game as you do and there is no right and wrong playstyle.</div></div><hr />

They talk about making Rain of fire not essential to single target ember generation, but don't mention where they plan to stick the ember generation lost from not using it in single target rotation?

Not only you're a minority, but you were also able to do that because of the lack of content to do with one character in other xpacs.<br />

So yes, he was actually right, we do play alts because we have nothing to do. Even in MoP, ppl only started their alts when they considered finished with their mains.<br />

<br />
<br />
So the widely reviled alt unfriendliness of MoP finally gets addressed in the final major patch of the expansion and this solution only applies to raiders, and only raiders above LFR?<br />
<br />
Wow thanks.<br />
<br />
omg... flex is so hard... lol.<br />
<br />
By the end of an expansion, if you don't have at least one character geared enough to go SoO flex... you actually didn't play the game until now. You're not classified as alt.<br />
<br />
We're on the last patch, there isn't that much time left to keep going on every single raid to grab loot to reach ilvls required to current (and last) LFR/Flex/Normal.<br />
<br />
They're not addressing the &quot;alt unfriendliness of MoP&quot;, that was addressed long ago (even removing some of the XP needed to level before MoP became old xpac, they usually do that after releasing a new one). They're speeding up the gearing and giving you a carrot to chase even after you've finished your &quot;content&quot; by giving you itens that can be used up to level 100, even for your &quot;main&quot; on next xpacs.<br />
<br />
Why complain?<br />

Unless you provide me your numbers to prove me that I am minority, you have no idea what you are talking about. From my small statistical number of friends - guildmates, I could assume that I am in majority, since me and my friends we got multiply level 90 chars before starting playing them in dungeons/raids. But my statistical pool is small for wow population, so I have no idea who is the minority or not..and you have no idea too. Only Blizzard knows.<br />
<br />
And I am asking again what do people think content is for their mains. Multiply raids per tier (like TBC)? Lot of dailies? More dailies?many more dailies?Pet battles? Dailies?</div></div><hr />

there is nothing wrong with solo. For me MMO is about to play in a living world that lot of people co-exist, not specifically group content. I like lot of solo content too, except the boring dailies :) I like to solo old raids and solo scenarios can be challenging if you don't have good gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good points. I agree with all of them. I refuse to do dailies at this point after the burnout of the last two expansions. I'd prefer more class based storylines similar to the legendary quest line this expansion but doing that much content for a single class is wasteful in Blizzard's eyes. It has its flaws but this is where SWTOR is superior in storytelling. I'd much rather have voice actors rather than read through lines and lines of script but it's all about the bottom line for Blizzard and I don't really blame them that much. It's just what I want out of a game; less cut scenes and more interaction where I'm the center of the story rather than a group of &quot;heroes&quot;. Maybe I'm playing the wrong game...;)</div></div><hr />
