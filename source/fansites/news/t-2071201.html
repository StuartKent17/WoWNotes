Craig Amai Leaves Blizzard<br />
Lead quest designer Craig Amai (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Craig_Amai) is leaving Blizzard after more than ten years. He most recently worked on the Artifact system in Legion. <br />

Paid BattleTag Changes Now Available<br />
Looking to change up how you identify yourself in the Blizzard online community? The BattleTag® you originally chose doesn’t have to be your nickname for all eternity—sometimes you want to switch to something more suited to the hero (or villain) you’ve become since you first arrived in the Blizzard universe.<br />
<br />
While we’ve always provided players with one free BattleTag change per account, now we’re pleased to offer an additional paid BattleTag change service (https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/battle-tag-name-change) for those of you who would appreciate the opportunity to choose yet another new moniker.<br />
<br />
Free First Change<br />
If you’re ready for something new and haven’t already used your free BattleTag change, simply visit your Account Management Dashboard (https://eu.battle.net/login/en/?ref=https://eu.battle.net/account/management/&amp;app=bam&amp;cr=true), and click the Change link under your Account Details to the right of your current tag.<br />
<br />
If you haven’t used your free change yet, don’t worry—BattleTag changes don’t expire and yours will be waiting for you if and when you ever decide to use it.<br />
<br />
If you’ve already used your first free change and still feel like a new nickname would be a better fit, the option to purchase an additional change will be available within Account Management. Changes are available for 10 € each, and your new moniker will be reflected on your friends list automatically after making the change.<br />
<br />
For more details on the feature, check out our support article (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/400005) or visit the Shop page (https://eu.battle.net/shop/en/product/battle-tag-name-change).<br />
<br />
Paid BattleTag Change FAQ<br />
If I want to change my BattleTag, does it have to be something unique?<br />
BattleTags do not need to be unique. You can use any name you want, as long as it follows our Naming Policy. Each BattleTag is assigned a numeric ID to create a unique identifier (for example, FallenSlayer#3592).<br />
<br />
Will changing my BattleTag affect my friends list?<br />
Your friends will now automatically see you listed under your new BattleTag, but otherwise your friends list will not be affected by this change.<br />
<br />
Will new accounts still get a free name change upon creation?<br />
Yes. All new Battle.net accounts will continue to receive one free BattleTag change upon creation.<br />
<br />

Patch 7.1 PTR Dungeon/Raid Testing Plans<br />
This is an unusual PTR, in that we don't typically have fresh dungeon and raid content to test when a new expansion has just launched, but then again, Legion isn't exactly the typical expansion.<br />
<br />
For testing purposes, we'll be treating Karazhan like a Normal-mode raid, since that's what it resembles in most ways except raid size. That means it'll be closed for the majority of the PTR cycle, but we'll open it up at least a couple of times for a couple of days (without any attunement required, though one will be on live - for testing you'll be able to just zone in) at a time for open-ended testing and feedback.<br />
<br />
We also have Trial of Valor to test, as well as a few Nighthold bosses we'll want to revisit for numerical tuning. We realize that most raiding guilds are going to have their hands quite full starting next week, but we're going to try to sneak in one raid testing day on Monday (probably around 1pm PDT, 10pm CEDT). We'll update with exact testing details within a day or so, assuming server stability holds up. <br />
<br />
I sincerely apologize on behalf of the team for all this content, and thank you in advance for any time you take away from the live servers in order to help us test it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Testing Schedule - September 19<br />
On Monday, September 19, we will be conducting a focused raid test of two Trial of Valor Heroic bosses, and one Mythic Nighthold boss.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires a fixed 20-player group.<br />
<br />
Monday, September 19<br />
<br />
Odyn - Heroic Trial of Valor<br />
13:00 PDT (16:00 EDT, 22:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Guarm - Heroic Trial of Valor<br />
14:00 PDT (17:00 EDT, 23:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Spellblade Aluriel - Mythic Nighthold<br />
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 00:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />

Legendary Item Drop Rate Bug<br />
We’ve identified and hotfixed an issue that could cause Legion legendary items to drop more frequently than intended, if a player had already received their first legendary. <br />
<br />
Thanks to everyone who reported this - the ability to look at specific cases where this was and wasn’t happening was invaluable for isolating what exactly was causing this bug to occur.<br />

Enchanting<br />
<br />

Enchant Cloak – Gift of Critical Strike, Enchant Cloak – Gift of Haste, Enchant Cloak – Gift of Mastery, and Enchant Cloak – Gift of Versatility now increase the player’s movement speed by 2% (was 10%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: In fights where movement speed is important, Draenor cloak enchants (which reward run speed) were outperforming the best Legion cloak enchants (which do not). To protect enchanters from having to farm Draenor materials, we've reduced the run speed bonus on Draenor cloak enchants to 2%. We feel that cloak enchants aren’t the ideal place for run speed enhancements, and we will continue to look at interesting run speed options as the expansion continues.<br />

On “Shrine of the Truthguard”, players who navigate to Dalaran by using their Dalaran Hearthstone, regular Hearthstone, or by getting ported, will receive the “Return to Dalaran” objective and become able to turn in the quest to Lord Maxwell Tyrosus.<br />
The Mining World Quest “Leyworms” now requires 10 Leystone-Encrusted Spikes (was 40).<br />
Valewalker Farodin should now properly tell his story during the quest &quot;Fragments of Disaster.&quot;<br />
In Maw of Souls, Ymiron’s Broken Blade now drops on Normal, Heroic, and Mythic difficulties for Warriors who have completed &quot;Champions of Skyhold&quot;.<br />

Developer Interview - Luis Barriga<br />
MMOGames (http://www.mmogames.com/gamearticles/interview-world-warcraft-legion-lead-game-designer/) had the opportunity to talk to Luis Barriga about Legion and Patch 7.1. Most of it is already well known, but there were a few important points:<br />
<br />
One of the issues that we see is there’s a lot of friction in getting things setup. What we’ve seen in games like Diablo and Heroes of the Storm are systems where they just notify you that ‘Hey Eric just joined a queue’ and I click and request to join. Already we’re thinking about stuff to add to our content patches.<br />
We finished Legion and then we didn’t stop. Okay, here’s the next patch. It’s going to be ready for testing soon. I can’t recall a time when we’ve been so aggressive when we’ve had plans for this patch and the next patch already.<br />
The main thing that we want to drive is that we want our fans to know we mean it when we say we have a lot of content planned for you guys. We’re well aware that it was an issue towards the end of Warlords and we want to reassure our fans that we have a content train that’s not going to stop.</div></div><hr />

Not worried just kind of sucks honestly. Like 10 employees from all different areas left. Former CFO, Chris, Jonathan, and Coffee-bird etc. Just kind of crazy to think about. I am sure everyone moves on and wants to do different things. I think we can all see that, but I am sure it really comes down to time, money and family etc and it's a hard to up your hourly rate at times.</div></div><hr />

AWESOME that they nerf the 10% of cloak and then plan to replace it later...with the same thing, just for Legion.<br />
Thats the idea of Blizzard? Lets take the good ideas of LAST expansion, nerf them, then reintroduce them as NEW stuff for the coming expansion.<br />
the GIFT soft costs more to make, thats why they are more expensive and they are blue, hence they are better than start of legion enchants<br />
instead of nerfing something, would it not be better to come up with some other idea for legion? <br />
either way, great job ruining enchanters cash flow with the nerf cause no-one in the right mind pays 2k for a cloak enchant just to get 2% speed.<br />

That statement is sort of telling<br />

<br />
It does make me wonder if the common thread here is they feel Blizzard is overworking them, especially with how they're ramping up content/the workload compared to the past. I think this is a genuine possibility. Sucks for them. At least the game is great for it, but at their expense. Just as another poster above mentioned, many of these guys are getting up their in age and might not be able to handle or justify the workload<br />
<br />
That's just my two cents though. Until now I felt like I was missing pieces of the puzzle, but now I'd say there's at least a 50/50 chance of this being what's happening</div></div><hr />

<br />
I HOPE this isn't activision forcing people out.<br />

Those classes have to walk around at literally 100% runspeed. <br />
<br />
Really no fun at all.<br />

On my DK and hunter, I would be happy with a 10% runspeed neck enchant with ZERO additional stats. The game just isn't fun for me at 100% runspeed. I haven't played WoW at 100% runspeed in &gt;10 years. Feels like I'm swimming through molasses.</div></div><hr />

It does make me wonder if the common thread here is they feel Blizzard is overworking them, especially with how they're ramping up content/the workload compared to the past. I think this is a genuine possibility. Sucks for them. At least the game is great for it, but at their expense. Just as another poster above mentioned, many of these guys are getting up their in age and might not be able to handle or justify the workload<br />
<br />
That's just my two cents though. Until now I felt like I was missing pieces of the puzzle, but now I'd say there's at least a 50/50 chance of this being what's happening<br />

What a coincidence on how many left right before and during WoD or a short while after.<br />

He describes himself as an &quot;aspiring indie developer&quot;.<br />
<br />
Reading between the lines, it seems he thought his imagination wasn't being adequately explored by Blizzard. For how long he's thought this, who knows?<br />
<br />
Luckily for him, the failures of WoD, or any expansion for that matter, can't be leveled at his feet. So, indie or not, his ideas will very probably be given voice.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Insofin</div><div class="date">2016-09-17, 07:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Most of the people leaving are people who have worked in the same position (or really related one) for 10+ years. And regardless of how much passion you have, you end up getting bored of doing the same. In most jobs, Human Resources department avoid that by rotating job positions within their business, however in Blizzard, it seems most of their workers were stagnating in their positions.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the problem is that World of Warcraft is living for too long. Not only for the game's sake (they're pushing the lore and content to an extreme that's starting to get ridiculous, like creating pandaria or parallel universe traveling), but also for the sake of the company. If this game ended in WotLK or Cataclysm, Blizzard could have started a new project and therefore allow most workers to change their positions/what they did, or even start a completely new project with a complete different focus. If you think about it, they've never been working in the same game for 10+ years, with the exception of WoW (they've done in sagas, but not the same game). Warcraft 1, Diablo 1, Starcraft, Warcraft 2, Diablo 2, Warcraft 3... In none of their previous games have they ever worked for 10+ years. After 3, 4 or maybe 5 years, almost all workers would change the project they were working in with a new one, and doing so gave them the oportunity to &quot;reset&quot; their passion.</div></div><hr />

Mythic raids only is a good start, but certainly not enough. We need hard, grind-heavy attunements for each Raid, better yet, for each single wing of a raid. And mythic+8 should be the only Dungeon Difficulty - and remove that cancer lfr/lfd. Then we may have a chance.</div></div><hr />

Lmfao you want them to not focus on leveling zones at all and only focus on raiding so that only a portion of the community is pleased.

He will, they all will, the big names leaving. It's good news for us, Pardo's next project will be something massive I imagine. Truly next gen. They just can't do that with Wow unfortunately, but things need to evolve, have been WAY too static for a long time. Some good decisions being made here, the future is there for seizing and Wow certainly ain't it. The big names left at a good time and left us with arguably Wow's finest expansion but of course that is up for discussion and not everyone will agree.</div></div><hr />

Pick one of the following &quot;save face&quot; scenarios:<br />

-&quot;My contract is up, but I'm gonna make it look like this was all my decision.&quot;<br />

People asking for &quot;new blood&quot; have no idea what they're asking for. You want &quot;new blood&quot; go play a shitty mobile game, or wait a couple years and see if WoW degenerates into one.<br />

I will say if Craig was responsible for WoD's leveling experience he basically saved that expansion from being a total meltdown. If not, well he was probably a loose end Blizzard wanted to eject.</div></div><hr />

Lemme guess, when you leave a job, there's a celebration after you walk out the door.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It does look like Pardo might be poaching talent, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Generally when you see people in senior positions leave, it's because they already hit the ceiling within their company and have no way to advance further. Their only options may be lateral moves, or they may have transitioned from a creative role to a managerial role. Within companies like Blizzard, there's also a strong chance that you become surrounded by a lot of other talented people and maybe don't feel as if your own contributions matter as much.<br />
<br />
And of course, you can't discount the fact that when you've been working on the same project for a decade or more, you might experience burn out or feel creatively stifled by having to continuously work within an established framework.<br />
<br />
In those situations, you may feel that your best opportunities are to try something completely new. If some of these people are heading to Bonfire, it's so they can try and get in on the ground floor of something new, that they can contribute to in a more meaningful way.<br />
<br />
It's not a bad thing, though, as it will allow newer, younger talent to advance within the company. Overwatch is a good example of a project at Blizzard that is really being driven by newer talent, steered by veterans.</div></div><hr />

I'll take a look at your application, however I don't think it will take much convincing the other team members to welcome you. The time we have spent together in the past was fun, and I can't wait to spend even more time working side-by-side with you the next opportunity we get.&quot;<br />

MoP was fine aside from the 14 months of SoO. Even then it wasn't remotely as bad as the nothing to do the majority of the expac that was WoD. That's been the majority of complaints for years. It's important for a game like this to have something other than raid or die. Legion has that so I think you will be surprised how this ends up compared to the past.</div></div><hr />

What we’ve seen in games like Diablo and Heroes of the Storm are systems where they just notify you that ‘Hey Eric just joined a queue’ and I click and request to join. Already we’re thinking about stuff to add to our content patches. <br />
<br />
Blegh. If the Call to Arms satchel still works if you accept the other person's request, great. If it doesn't, AND it alerts people other than your direct friends, like guildies... that's going to be annoying. &quot;O u spammin heroics, can i come pls&quot; and an invite request would get old pretty quick. A lot of the time I like to just solo queue : \.</div></div><hr />

WoW really needs some NEW inspiration and put an end to this pointless recycling. Hopefully the next expansion they'll just skip out on zones and just focus on RAIDS - mythic raids for the elite players that have been playing since release. They really need to stop making these &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;heroic&quot; raids, what a joke. The second they stop catering to casuals the game will once again rise to the top.<br />
<br />
LOL! You serious? &quot;Casuals&quot; are what makes this game in first place. What you are saying is: Blizzard should focus only on content that maybe 5-10% (my estimate) is doing...at best. Don't get me wrong...I am an &quot;elite player&quot; and I find your idea hilarious and just plain stupid. In fact the best time for raiding was back in WotLK with Ulduar where you had normal raids but with bosses which had certain hard modes you could activate/trigger during the fight if you fancied it. After that they added heroic mode and then mythic in Pandaland...basically they divided the same content into 4 different modes which I find ridiculous. I could understand normal and heroic but adding LFR and Mythic is just going overboard. 2</div></div><hr />

That's what I said. I hated WOD in beta stage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;People who work at a place for 6 years want to move on&quot;.....well.....didn't happen during Wotlk/Cata/Mop) at such a frequency and at such high levels now did it?<br />
<br />
Yes it did.<br />
<br />
Really, look at the names in the credits. Also, the end of an expansion is a good time to leave, they just finished a long project (Legion) and want to do something new. And frankly Legion is the most successful expansion yet, so it's nothing to do with the game not doing well.</div></div><hr />

First month was done September 30th. Second month was done October 30th. The sky should have fallen by now.</div></div><hr />
