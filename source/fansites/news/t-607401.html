Kil'jaeden information summary<br />
Can't really call it a preview, can't really call it speculation either, this post is here to summarize all the info we've got about the last boss of Sunwell Plateau: Kil'jaeden.<br />
<br />
Warning : You really shouldn't read this post if you don't want the fight spoiled. <br />
<br />
Loot table<br />
This is probably the most accurate information we've got about Kil'jaeden for the moment, even if the drops aren't confirmed yet (obviously), the ilvl and itemIDs of these item confirm their drop location. <br />

Dialogue transcript and spells<br />
That's probably the only decent resource we've got about the fight itself. It looks like the fight will have a lot of phases and cutscenes involving the players, Kil'jaeden, Kalecgos (http://www.wowwiki.com/Kalecgos), and Anveena (http://www.wowwiki.com/Anveena). It's not really hard to guess what will become of Anveena after reading the dialogues and checking the spells.<br />
<br />

First &quot;real&quot; screenshot of Kil'jaeden ?<br />
This screenshot was sent during the late phases of patch 2.4 testing on PTRs. According to the sender this is a leaked screenshot from a GM, I still can't fully confirm it's legit but it definitely looked good enough to be posted. Keep in mind that it could be a fake, it wasn't that hard to run 2.4 emulated server a few weeks ago, even if none of them was public. <br />

<br />
<br />
Encounter bugs<br />
Two bugs are already listed in the GM Petition tool in game, they confirm that players will have to use &quot;Shield Orbs&quot; during the encounter (see Kalecgos dialogue). The 2nd bug is a bigger problem and it could be hard to make any decent progress on the fight until the bug is fixed (most likely in 2.4.2)<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
When will we be able to fight him ?<br />
Raids need the last door unlocked to be able to fight him, the door to M'uru was only unlocked a week ago and it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard wanted to deploy the Patch 2.4.2 on live servers to fix some of the bugs in the encounter before making it available to players. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't expect it before a few weeks, probably after the release of patch 2.4.2 (and it could be as soon as tomorrow ... or next week). Don't forget, that's pure speculation and nothing is confirmed by Blizzard. <br />

Kalecgos is summoning orbs assumed to damage Kil'Jaeden but it says hunter's mark which suggests that the raid will be attacking the shield orbs, so I conclude that like the orb Anveena is being held in, Kil will summon shield orbs to surround him which the raid party must destroy before progressing. Since &quot;shield orbs&quot; sound pretty bland, I'm gonna guess that the encounter is at least a three stage battle, with his fourth phase being sometype of enrage timed trigger.<br />
<br />
From some of his other speech, there will be some type of mirror match which sounds similar to BT, but also lacking excitement/originality.<br />
<br />
I really hope that Anveena in her &quot;zombie&quot; phase plays a major role in the encounter.</div></div><hr />

The only &quot;source&quot; for that change was &quot;it's in the game files&quot;, there is nothing related to weapon damage in the game files. I'll let you do your own conclusion.</div></div><hr />
