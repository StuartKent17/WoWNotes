Warcraft Movie Teaser<br />
Legendary released a nice teaser for the Warcraft movie tonight. This is best viewed with their app on your phone, as it is a 360 spherical video. The video below will not give you the same experience.<br />
<br />
We contacted them to ask if recording would be allowed during the presentation and if they would release the footage from it to the public, but only got confirmation that no recording will be allowed.<br />
<br />

Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - July 8<br />
Creatures and NPCs<br />
Tanaan Jungle<br />
<br />
Captain Ironbeard (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/93076-captain-ironbeard) now has a guaranteed chance to drop Equipment Blueprint: Ghostly Spyglass (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128257-equipment-blueprint-ghostly-spyglass).<br />
Varyx the Damned (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/92451-varyx-the-damned) now returns to his spawn location instead of despawning if he drops out of combat. Additionally, only 1 beam needs to be blocked to restart the encounter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
Garrison Quests<br />
<br />
[Requires a realm restart] Fixed an issue where completing daily assault objectives in Tanaan Jungle was incorrectly also granting completion credit for daily assault objectives in the Garrison.<br />
<br />
Spires of Arak<br />
<br />
Call of the Raven Mother (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/35009-call-of-the-raven-mother): Fixed an issue where interacting with items during the ritual was causing player pets to use their abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Hellfire Citadel<br />
Tyrant Velhari<br />
<br />
Fixed a timing issue that could cause Tyrant Velhari to use the incorrect finishing move just as a transition into the next stage happened.<br />
<br />
Xhul'horac<br />
<br />
Adjusted scaling to reduce the amount of health by roughly 10% on Xhul'horac, Omnus, Unstable Voidfiend, and Vanguard Akkelion for a 10-player raid on Normal and Heroic difficulty. Health should remain the same as before for raids with 30 players.<br />
<br />
Mannoroth<br />
<br />
Mannoroth no longer transforms back into a skeleton after being defeated.<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause Gazing Shadows to sometimes not reduce movement speed.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Ashran<br />
<br />
Fixed a number of issues affecting Ashran events that could cause characters to drop out of stealth effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Increased stat bonuses for critical strike, Versatility, Stamina, and Spirit on all Wild Gladiator (Warlords Season 2) trinkets by 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
Clicking “Join Raid” in the Adventure Guide should now open the Premade Groups menu instead of Raid Finder.<br />
<br />

Armor Sets<br />
<br />
Yesterday's hotfix on July 7 for Tier-18 4-piece set bonus for Mistweaver Monks should now be healing for the correct amount.<br />
<br />
<br />

Talents<br />
<br />
Yesterday’s hotfix on July 7 that reduced the healing of Execution Sentence by 25% in PvP combat now only applies to Holy Paladins. It has been returned to its previous effectiveness for Retribution and Protection Paladins.<br />

Warcraft Movie Trailer at SDCC<br />
Well, as the Legendary Comic-Con page says:<br />
<br />
Legendary’s Hall H panel will be taking place on Saturday from 2:30pm-3:30pm, and hosted by Chris Hardwick of Nerdist. WARCRAFT fans in particular, you will not want to miss it. (Hint, hint!)<br />
<br />
Anyone at Comic-Con this week/weekend should certainly fit the Legendary panel into their schedule. I've gone quite a few times and I'm pretty consistently surprised at how many times I'm told I'll never get in, or that I need to camp for days, when I always show up just a little early that morning and get into the hall with room to spare. If you're there, it's not as crazy as everyone makes it out to be. In my experience anyway. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/379859-movie-trailer-comming-this-week-end/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300221909?page=1#7))<br />
<br />
<br />
Racials and PvP<br />
So, we agree that Every Man for Himself (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/59752-every-man-for-himself) is a problem. It's one that we want to fix. It's also a more complicated issue to solve than it may initially seem. We want to reduce the effectiveness of the Human racial, but we don't want to leave Humans with a useless racial either.<br />
<br />
With Patch 6.2, we reduced the effectiveness of on-use trinkets which, in turn, reduced the relative strength of having two throughput trinkets equipped. Today, we’ve just pushed a hotfix that increases the raw stats on the Medallion trinkets (e.g. Versatility, Crit, Stamina, or Spirit) by 50%. <br />
<br />
Our intent with both of these changes is to still allow Humans to benefit from equipping two throughput trinkets, but reduce how much of a benefit that is when compared to equipping a Medallion enough that other racial abilities feel more competitive. We'd love to hear how this change is working out once you've had a chance to play with it a little.<br />
<br />
Re: &quot;Why not just get rid of racials entirely?&quot;<br />
<br />
We like racials. It's cool that there's a subtle difference for, say, a Rogue who chooses Orc instead of Undead, or a Priest who picks Night Elf instead of Dwarf. It makes each race feel different in a way that isn't just cosmetic. It's only a problem when one is so much better than the others that you feel stupid for playing anything else.<br />
<br />
Realistically, sure, there will probably always be a &quot;best&quot; race -- just like there will probably always be a &quot;best&quot; healer, or &quot;best&quot; comp, etc. That's to be expected. We just want things to be close enough that there's some room for difference of opinion on what exactly the &quot;best&quot; option is.<br />
<br />
Looking through this thread and some responses on Twitter, I'm already seeing some people saying &quot;Humans are still the best&quot; and some people saying &quot;Humans are worthless now.&quot; That's a good thing, I think. It means the difference is small enough that there's a discussion to be had. <br />

Disgusting Oozeling no longer turns the owner green, intentional or bug?<br />

<br />
PvP<br />
Weird every Ashran Instance I have joined since 6.2 is 5-10 Horde and 40 or more Alliance. Lots of bots running around too.<br />
Strange. We strictly enforce a 1:1 ratio. Even if a bunch of horde leave, the server gets priority to be filled back to 1:1 (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/616397615924670464))<br />
We look at the realm populations constantly and they are all 1:1. Every single instance of Ashran. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/616397744127803392))<br />
<br />
have the queue times gone done noticeably ? I still get 1-2 hrs on average.<br />
My alliance toon is currently in a 40 min queue. Better but still unacceptable. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/616407264216358912))<br />

Also the version of Stormwind in WoW is nothing like Stormwind in the First War. Old Town is the only part of original Stormwind that survives.<br />
<br />
But they've clearly made it look like the WoW version.<br />

I'll just let that one go because I'm sure it won't even make the top 100 lore inaccuracies in the final movie.</div></div><hr />

I hear you man, this is probably one of the coolest videos I've ever seen, even with the low quality on youtube. For the people crying about lore inaccuracies already...lol, get a grip. We don't even know who the statues depict. Do you think humans just started making statues of people after the first war?

That is not the proper way to build hype for a movie epically when they are going to have to go up against big juggernauts next year. If they were smart they would at least have a real teaser out by now like some 2016 movies already do</div></div><hr />

According to lore, this is First Stormwind before First War. So we don´t actually know how Old Stormwind looked like. Ingame version of the Stormwind is a New Stormwind (First one was destroyed after First War and then Stormwind was rebuilded from scratch). So positioning of buildings are irrelevant. But what is relevant is, that Old Stormwind has Valley of Heroes with Alliance Expedition statues. Which doesn´t make sense lorewise. Alliance Expedition was after Second War. And statues were builded in Stormwind after whole reconstruction of destroyed version. Movie plot is set to First War. So what we can see there is First Stormwind, so those statues shouldn´t be there.<br />
<br />
So mighty Marcus, Turalyon, Khadgar, Alleria..... are a big heroes of Alliance before they became heroes.<br />

Absolutely. Sometimes they get leaked, but generally speaking it's kept private. They'll most likely upload the panel afterwards, but the teaser trailer will probably be edited out of the footage. That even happens with, like, animatics and clips for Adult Swim cartoons.<br />
<br />
It's possible that they'll release it, but I wouldn't expect to see it if you aren't actually attending the panel.</div></div><hr />

If you're able, from that screenshot, to determine those statues ARE the ones of Turalyon, Alleria and so, then you have a very very good eye, sir.<br />

No one has ever seen pre-FW Stormwind, so that could be completely different statues, which would have been replaced in the future (when SW is rebuilt) by those of the Lost Expedidtion members.I think they just goofed with the whole city. No one saw a pre-first war SW yes but the Valley of Heroes, the districts for the most part, the Cathedral, and the Keep are almost exact replicas of their in-game counterparts. I don't really mind such details all I'm hoping for is at least a decent video game-to-movie adaptation.</div></div><hr />

Are you saying non-Warcraft fans will enjoy the movie more when Valley of Heroes is present or when the Stormwind keep looks like a carbon copy from in-game? If anything sticking to lore by removing Valley of Heroes, changing up the districts and the Stormwind keep would only alienate those WoW babbys who know nothing about the lore just the aesthetics from the game.</div></div><hr />

On FFXIV, I don't feel zones that use ground mounts are &quot;tedious&quot; because the zones are small and with the teleport system, travel time still feels the same it always did without getting screwed because there's no flying. And the mechanics are not &quot;pointless&quot; in zones that have flying. The big thing being you do have to earn it in each zone, via a couple of tasks. Once you have it, it is similar to WoW's in those zones, but feels more rewarding due to having to earn it, and also that most of the zones are designed with flying in mind(areas you have to have flying to reach, more vertical terrain design, etc.) In other words, what WoW used to do with flying in TBC and, to a lesser extent, wraith. Then, in cata, they made it too easy to get, stopped designing the world with it in mind, and it became nothing more than a fix for WoW's shitty transport system with the flight paths. In all honesty, whoever made this videos has all these clips of various MMO's, but it really doesn't feel like she actually played FFXIV. But whatever, just giving feedback as asked.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But they've clearly made it look like the WoW version.<br />
<br />
I'll just let that one go because I'm sure it won't even make the top 100 lore inaccuracies in the final movie.<br />
<br />
Just like LOTRO &amp; Game of Thrones, I expect their to be differences.</div></div><hr />

Having it or not having it are not our only two options. If they don't want people flying directly to a quest objective and flying right back out, do something about it - make creatures able to &quot;shoot down&quot; flyers if they get too close, add a cooldown, or a hundred other things.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes they get leaked, but generally speaking it's kept private. They'll most likely upload the panel afterwards, but the teaser trailer will probably be edited out of the footage. That even happens with, like, animatics and clips for Adult Swim cartoons.<br />
<br />
It's possible that they'll release it, but I wouldn't expect to see it if you aren't actually attending the panel.<br />
<br />
Damn. I'm dying to see that trailer so much. I always thought the reason it was kept exclusive to atendees was because it wasn't polished enough for the public, but they've had 8 months since Blizzcon to polish it. Hopefully we get to see it soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A flyover is even a rather extensive teaser, given how a simple still image, or a couple of written lines from the plot are already called teaser too....<br />
<br />
A teaser .... does exactly what it's name says... It teases you without you getting anything or anywhere. <br />
A trailer is what you expected probably... Mission accomplished.... Teaser effective..</div></div><hr />

Actually the video itself it's 1080p and it have the information of 360º around the camera, but because you see just a section of it, you see less pixels and then it looks blurry.<br />
<br />
To show a 360º video with 1080p resolution in all directions probably you will need a 4K video.</div></div><hr />

While I get where you are coming from, this certainly makes it look like 360p tops..<br />
I guess youtube would need to support something like UHDV-2 or higher to actually give a normal fullHD resolution for 360°.. but then I have to say: Gimme something that actually shows the movie, instead of terrible tech demos for something that isn't even on the market yet :P.</div></div><hr />

The source was 1920x1080 and included 2 x videos for what I assume were left and right eyes. This means the entire 3D view is 1080x540. Add to that Youtube compression and stretching of the video for 3D and this is what you get. It looks marginally better on phones, part of that is the smaller screen and part is much less compression. The quality you see is about the best you can get from the source on Youtube.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wondee why the community of real mmo gamers hate your game? Each expansion you cut off past contrnt completely so the game doesn't grow; it just becomes the new xpac.<br />
<br />
In EQ at level 100 you still couldn't solo raid mobs from 5 xpacs ago . Wow people are already soloing mythic garrosh roflmao.<br />
<br />
Cater to the kids, you'll continue to have a revolving door of subs. <br />
<br />
When your own devs are on record saying you ruined the genre and u continue to follow the same principles treating wow like a moba, something is wrong. <br />
<br />
When college professors upload their dissertation regarding the downfall of the once inspiring mmorpg industry and they cite your greedy asses as the centerpiece, something is wrong.<br />
<br />
Case in point (only cause it's current and relevant, can't pick out of the 100s of examples) flying.<br />
<br />
Why not just take out mounts completely? (Oh yea cause You guys use rmt, same rmt u ban over). Just make us able to warp anywhere. Just remove chat too. That will please the kids.<br />
<br />
If I may be so bold, we need more means of getting epics too. Free best in slot items didn't cut it. Not like we don't clear all the content you offer the kids since it's all instanced, has no contestation, and no gating, fast enough as it is. Then what? Cancel our subs of course.<br />
<br />
I can't wait for pantheon and maybe shroud of the avatar If they get some real end game in.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why they wouldn't stick to the lore. Non Warcraft players will not know the difference but players would. Of course it depends on which lore they use since it is different in every game. I would prefer WC1/2 lore for a movie about that time frame.</div></div><hr />

Honestly it makes me wonder what's wrong with the film. Generally speaking, films that don't get much pre-release footage out there end up being bombs and the footage was hidden for a reason.<br />
<br />
I wasn't impressed with the &quot;3D&quot; Stormwind flyover. I've seen stuff like that in games 10 years ago.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping they prove that wrong at the ComiCon panel.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, otherwise if you have a great film, you'd be proud to show it. Build the anticipation. Kinda reminds me of Triple A games, where there's a review/preview embargo until hours after the release, cause they're terrified it gets bombed by reviewers and ppl don't buy it.</div></div><hr />

LotR ? Without flying ?<br />
<br />
What about the Eagles ? Without them : <br />
- No more Gandalf<br />
- No more Frodo and Sam<br />
- No more Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and no more any of the remaining guys in the army of Men for the last battle of LotR.<br />
<br />
So if we stick to the LotR trilogy, without flying, Sauron wins easily. <br />
<br />
<br />
However, if we go further : without the Eagles, Bilbo dies in The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey. The Unique is lost for ever. End of story, no chaos unleashed. And no trilogies.<br />
So yeah, maybe your right, no flying is best for fantasy stories. Maybe not for the fantasy movies industry.</div></div><hr />

When loaded into VR Player, the overall distortion removal and mouse control is excellent but the quality is on par with a 360p youtube video.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LotR ? Without flying ?<br />
<br />
What about the Eagles ? Without them : <br />
- No more Gandalf<br />
- No more Frodo and Sam<br />
- No more Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and no more any of the remaining guys in the army of Men for the last battle of LotR.<br />
<br />
So if we stick to the LotR trilogy, without flying, Sauron wins easily. <br />
<br />
<br />
However, if we go further : without the Eagles, Bilbo dies in The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey. The Unique is lost for ever. End of story, no chaos unleashed. And no trilogies.<br />
So yeah, maybe your right, no flying is best for fantasy stories. Maybe not for the fantasy movies industry.<br />
<br />
The award for &quot;being so short the joke just flies over&quot; goes to........</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, I'd like to address this 2 minute 45 second curse video about flight and how it doesn't even capture the nuances it glosses over, like the psychological problems of having flight for a period of time and removing it. Not to mention the video glosses over many different MMO's and their flight mechanics and how they are unlocked, FF14:HW doing a rather fantastic and none too taxing job allowing for flight to be unlocked after you've experienced a large handful of the expansions content on a zone by zone basis.<br />
<br />
On the hole, this under 3 minute video does not even begin to capture the discussion of flight vs. no flight vs. structured flight in any of these games, especially World of Warcraft and gives arguments for no flying that have already been either debunked or proven to be irrelevant to that actual discussion. But what can I say, Curse is just following in the footsteps of many a youtuber (including myself) making a video about discussing a hot button topic with buzzwords and other nonsense.<br />
<br />
Ahhh Curse. Never fucking change.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mykro9</div><div class="date">2015-07-09, 10:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay. For those complaining about the actual VR video:<br />
<br />
The resolution is poor because it is a full spherical video fly over. You can take a phone (or in my case an iPad) and spin around, look up, look down and see EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
For those that cannot see the VR, imagine taking a flightpath style on rails flight over Stormwind, where you can take your mouse and spin around and look in any direction. That is what this 'teaser' VR looks like. <br />
<br />
The resolution is low because a full HD quality VR like this would be a HUGE file, maybe 5GB. As it is, it is still almost 500MB. <br />
<br />
For those that are complaining about it being US region locked, if everyone knew it was available AND everyone tried to download it, they would get DDOS'ed, unintentionally.<br />
<br />
As far as the YouTube video linked off the front page, when I tried to view it, it was split top and bottom, (for left and right eye) and had a weird fisheye style to th video, since it was the whole 360 degree view compressed to a 16x9 viewer field.</div></div><hr />

I also hate that they make such a big deal about not letting Comic-Con attendees post videos of trailers; the excitement from the crowd always makes me more interested in going to see the movie in question. Watch the original Iron Man Comic-Con &quot;bootleg&quot; trailer on YouTube. It's fantastic!<br />

From another thread I learned that a Stormwind to scale would be the size of current Elwyn forest. Which would be cool in theory but poor in practise.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2015-07-09, 10:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only question is which gets released first next June?<br />
<br />
If they release the movie first, then that would cut into people's leveling experience in the new expansion, but may provide some relief after they consolidate server populations with the whole log in problem.<br />
<br />
If they release the expansion first, then people will have to take time out from their leveling and raiding schedules and that would cut into sales.<br />
<br />
I think the best way would be to release it 1-2 months prior to the release of the next expansion, so it builds enough hype for the expansion. So July/Aug 2016 for the next expansion would be just fine.</div></div><hr />

How to train your Dragon had been so much better if Toothless had lost both of his wings and been forced to skip along the ground. Muh immursion! Gandalf should have died up on Isengard rather than being saved by a FLYING creature...wouldn't have broken immersion at all! :P</div></div><hr />

So we don´t actually know how Old Stormwind looked like. Ingame version of the Stormwind is a New Stormwind (First one was destroyed after First War and then Stormwind was rebuilded from scratch). So positioning of buildings are irrelevant. But what is relevant is, that Old Stormwind has Valley of Heroes with Alliance Expedition statues. Which doesn´t make sense lorewise. Alliance Expedition was after Second War. And statues were builded in Stormwind after whole reconstruction of destroyed version. Movie plot is set to First War. So what we can see there is First Stormwind, so those statues shouldn´t be there.<br />
<br />
So mighty Marcus, Turalyon, Khadgar, Alleria..... are a big heroes of Alliance before they became heroes.<br />

I like how you seem pretty intelligent at the start of your post explaining how it's the original Stormwind before being rebuilt from scratch; however, never consider that the statues are not the ones you see in-game, but rather another set of Heroes of Stormwind, which would later be replaced during the re-building process with the Heroes of the Second War...</div></div><hr />

Someday they may make VR quality games where you spend days inside of townships trying to get places, but given that today's player isn't interested in anything beyond max level and BIS rewards, I highly doubt the genre will ever survive intact. Sad, because when they make it to where you can come home from work, slip on your glasses and really become someone else for several hours, the offspring of this generation of 'gamers' will cry that it took longer than a few seconds to get some reward.</div></div><hr />

The cool thing is, that on the PC you can actually move the camera around while you're watching the teaser. My BF randomly found out after the clip stopped and he was moving through clouds when he moved his mouse - we played it again, and sure enough you were able to turn the angle of the camera and look to the sides and up in the sky etc. I was fkn facinated to say the least but I've never watched anything in a sphere setting or anything like that. Looked great though. Just a bit sad that people are murdering the movie for themselves (and possibly others) by focusing on minor details about Lore... C'mon.. IT'S A WARCRAFT MOVIE!

I'll just let that one go because I'm sure it won't even make the top 100 lore inaccuracies in the final movie.<br />
<br />
Yep. Makes no sense. You would've thought that they would've used this opportunity to take liberties with how Stormwind is laid out considering it was completely destroyed in the first war, but nope. They have statues of heroes from the second war and for some nonsensical reason the keep is next to the port instead of in the middle of old town. Also, those Alliance banners don't make sense. They have the dwarven, gnome, and elven elements when in the first war the Grand Alliance of Lordaeron was just an alliance of the seven human nations. The gnomes, dwarves, and high elves didn't join until the second war because the orcs hadn't reached their lands yet nor had the trolls joined the Horde yet. <br />
<br />
Come on Blizz. Don't eff this up with WoW fan service that completely ignores continuity.</div></div><hr />
