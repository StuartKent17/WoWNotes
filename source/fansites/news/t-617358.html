Also, the MSW note seems to be incomplete or incorrect. It doesn't really make sense. GC already said they are changing it use a PPM system. But he also said they were removing Lava Burst from the list of powers it affects. So even if this note is correct, it just means this build is outdated.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the contrary, if you read the whole tooltip it indicates it's back up from the PPM.<br />
<br />
Which indicates a reversal of the change as opposed to a skill that has yet to go through it.</div></div><hr />

Have we been playing the same game? Locks have been consistantly nerfed the entire TBC, just go and check the history of the patches. It was a long time since locks were dominating anything so what balancing are you talking about?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aikouka</div><div class="date">2008-10-04, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tell me about it. #1 on damage and yet still... buff after buff after buff.

<br />
<br />
Unholy had its main single target FU move (Scourge Strike) nerfed... I'm not too sure what you're talking about with buff after buff? The two biggest buffs I see there are Heart Strike (which had very little prowess over its supposed predecessor, Blood Strike and said buff was actually missing from two patches ago) and Black Ice... which I'm liking the Black Ice change even though I'm Blood... I like seeing them Sudden Doom procs changing into some sweet sweet damage numbers ;). But the Black Ice change is actually there (from what I can tell) to help out Frost. Frost has been a bit awkward as of late and last patch did boost frost damage, but it did it through making spamming Icy Touch being a top DPS mechanic. This was troublesome because it forced Frost users to use their frost runes while their Unholy runes just sat around never being used (because there's no such thing as a Blood+Unholy move). They nerfed Tundra Stalker's boost on Icy Touch and instead boosted Black Ice to push for an overall increase in frost damage.<br />
<br />
Death Knights weren't top on the damage meters last build, but I think this might help.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fiohna</div><div class="date">2008-10-04, 12:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you trying to indicate that MSW now procs on every attack? Because that's not the way it reads. The way it reads makes no sense at all. Even if that is what it's doing in this build, it makes no sense for them to buff it to be more powerful than ever only two days after GC informed us of its nerf. I'm still going to assume this is an erroneous patch note or an outdated build until I see official confirmation otherwise.<br />
<br />
<br />
Considering it says it has a 100% chance to do reduce the cast time by 20%, yes, it's no longer on ppm.<br />
<br />
It would be stupid if it had less than a 100% chance to do something when it procced (that's the point of a proc, is that something happens), so the proc rate is 100%.</div></div><hr />

Woops my bad, this was noted above. I am sorry you are having troubles man, keep up the good work.<br />
<br />
Honestly about the End of the World talk, and DKs, you do got a month to play this on live, really test it out. If your in the beta, you can enjoy the DK, but for now, I'd give your class a shot. Maybe I'm just happy with my warrior, but still. Maybe its all I got, and I will play the DK, but prob not to the end of the Warrior.<br />
<br />
Thoughts of the day:<br />
-Allows us our s3 shoulders, with no rating, for s5. Honestly should drop s3 to honor and drop s2. (Precedent)<br />
-Still missing the arms boost, I got about 200-400 lower dps for arms than fury on the ptr.<br />
-1200 DPS with dual Harbringers, OMFG. 700 on live with arms and one.<br />
-This is without the new WW, Slam and BT, all going up 10%.<br />
-I'd say I'll hit 1250-1300 easily. (Tested on the 1hp level 70 dummies)<br />
-VERY curious to see how the test dummies, and live compare. I soo want the test dummies in live now.<br />
<br />
Is Growl the ranged taunt for a druid now? Just curious thats 3/4 tanking classes IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
prior to first nerf it took about 10 seconds<br />
the last nerf made it so it if you are unlucky you could never have a full stack<br />
now this 'nerf' made it so you will have a stack every X minutes based on the PPM. (so if its 4ppm then it will proc approx every 15 seconds, then 5x15 = 75s)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shield of the Templar now also reduces all damage taken by 1/2/3%.<br />
<br />
Critical Block is something we're still keeping our eye on. I'm not going to promise a paladin version, but it's totally something we'll consider if paladin blocking starts to fall behind.<br />
<br />
Whoever said it, yes it's absolutely going to be a challenge trying to get parity among 4 classes with totally different mechanics, and in some sense the warrior to paladin comparison is the easy one. :) But we don't like having only one MT class, and we don't like giving everyone very similar gear, talents and abilities to tank, and we don't like the situation where you need a different tank for every fight because they all excell at certain types of encounters and suck at others. So the option we're left with is to have 4 who are different but relatively equal. <br />

MSW's duration still 30sec, but you build it up to 5 stacks very fast again (but I don't see it procc on each attack, sometimes the combat logs show me 3 proccs without a hit between them).<br />

As in, it either procs from crits or just PPM is very high as I am spamming it pretty much every 5-10 seconds now (runing OOM ~10-15sec before SR is up again in effect :P). Though I couldn't be bothered to level up my shammie on beta (and premade isn't copied yet), so can't say if it makes LvB instant or not (tooltip says it does, but tooltip seems to be bugged/work in progress) as LvB is not available on lvl70.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my tests in full T6 and other SP gear shows that (counting in totems and wolves, no other buffs, no heroism) I can cross 2k DPS VS lvl70 dummy. My personal DPS hovers around 1650, searing totem is ~100DPS, then wolves are in average ~270DPS - and that's with 2 slow weapons and WF on both (+WF glyph). WF/FT on slow/slow gave me a bit over 1900 DPS, and WF/FT with fast offhand is very close to WF/WF, though my fast offhand was of worse quality and not enchanted so it could very well surpass WF/WF if it would be enchanted. Ah, and all test were done in 5 minutes (full totem's duration).<br />
<br />
TLDR - my DPS on beta on lvl70 is way higher than on live, crossing 2k self buffed. No idea how it will look like in raids, but solo (VS lvl70 dummy, no external buffs/debuffs) I am easly over-DPSing warriors and hunters with similar gear. With all the raid buffs it will probably be very close betwen each DPS class now. I really see no reason to whine about enh. shamans in PVE in the current state, though alot can still change with numbers before patch.</div></div><hr />

the 4seks Blade twisting thing was only a Typo wich accure because of the latest sinister strike buff.<br />
It was alsways 8 secs, it was 8 secs even if the tooltip said 4... i know, I tested it.<br />

People like you really make me laugh. If you have a clue at all about WoW you would know that locks were totally gimped for the first year or so of the game. After that we were considered the strongest class a short time before TBC and a bit into S2 and that's all. Shamans were god mode for a long time in vanilla WoW, in fact up until TBC. By the way, if you ever bothered to read the patch history of locks you would learn that we have been consistently nerfed in nearly all of them and it’s common knowledge and yet we didn’t whine for all that time. Instead we learned to adapt and overcome but there is a limit and that limit has been reached now.<br />
So this time we are more than entitled to whine.<br />
<br />
By contrast the shaman community is the biggest whiner of WoW. Ever since you lost your god mode in vanilla WoW you have easily overtaken mages for the number 1 whining spot in this game. All I ever see when a shaman posts something is whine, whine and more whine.<br />
<br />
You know it’s no coincidence that IBTS is a common used abbreviation when you post anything on the forums. By the way, it means In Before The Shamans and too bad I forgot to add it to my original post. People like you will whine whatever happens; it’s in your nature.</div></div><hr />
