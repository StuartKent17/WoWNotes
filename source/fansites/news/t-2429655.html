According to this reddit thread (https://reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9fk8a2/ama_announcement_developer_ama_with_ion/), tomorrow, Friday September the 14th at 2 PM PDT Game Director Ion Hazzikostas will be doing an &quot;ask me anything&quot; in the WoW reddit (https://reddit.com/r/wow/) to answer questions about the live game. The thread will not be stickied per Blizzard's request, and there are a few guidelines to follow according to the post:<br />
<br />
<br />
Please remain civil and respectful at all times. In the interest of being able to have other AMAs in the future, the Mod team independently warns that any bad behavior and violation of reddit rules will be punished with a permanent ban, and the removal of your comment.<br />
Hopefully the community is able to discuss politely. Do not downvote, if you disagree with a comment, discuss or challenge it. The goal is to promote a respectful, useful discussion, as it is in everyone's best interests.<br />
Try to ask succinct, clear questions. Walls of text with 30 questions shoved into a single comment are heavily discouraged. Questions should nevertheless strive to be constructive. A comment such as &quot;fix the game&quot; will likely not get answered.<br />
<br />
Ythisens (https://www.reddit.com/user/CM_Ythisens) responded when asked why the thread won't be stickied.<br />
While /u/FlapSnapple (https://www.reddit.com/u/FlapSnapple) covered this I just wanted to say it from the shiny blue text.<br />
<br />
Essentially we'd prefer if an AMA live organically. We're guests on this platform and in this community. You run it, you decide what content you upvote or downvote. We think a force sticky doesn't abide by how Reddit itself functions and we shouldn't be an exception to that.<br />
<br />
Also most typical users and guests browse over the stickied posts even though its at the top. Sorry admins :P I promise I read them though.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people where pretty happy with legion actually...and it was really clear what people didn't like about it, the time gated content, AP farm and rng legendaries.<br />
<br />
They take away the abilities the legendaries gave, give more AP farm and even more feels time gated... <br />
<br />
I guess you are having a blast with the expansion and if so please tell me how you spend your wow time and how much do you play?<br />
<br />
Even though all the problems might not affect you personally you can't deny they are there.</div></div><hr />

I read this forum all the way through Legion. Literally every time when new content is released there is whining &quot;hot topic&quot; where people claim that change X will destroy whole game. And funny thing we had more whining during Legion than WoD, because.. it was rare thing to release new content in WoD (Legion had like 8 smaller and bigger patches, WoD had at best 4).<br />
<br />
That's why it's really difficult to find contructive criticism. But last week they drop the ball so hard with bugs that even relatively peaceful reddit went on fire.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes, it just &quot;became&quot; toxic. all by itself for no reason whatsoever....<br />
<br />
or maybe it's just reflective of the fact that people get angry when they are bilked out of their money for a shitty product.<br />
<br />
but not let's just just pre-emptively label anyone who finds BfA at all lacking as toxic so we can dismiss the reasons they are angry by pointing at some rude people and saying they are rude so nothing anyone says has any meaning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was happy during Legion. And yeah people complained during Legion but the tone was different. <br />
<br />
I am curious as to why it’s an AMA not a QnA. Maybe Lore is unavailable and nobody else wants to take it on. Maybe he wants to be able to give genuine long detailed answers that’s better in text. <br />
<br />
I do hope there’s some real questions. Not just tons of ‘the games crap you’re crap’. I’ve unsubscribed and think BfA is awful but asking or saying things like that is just pointless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry, but that's just fucking pathetic. Why do they even have forums? They don't use them for anything. And I'm not sorry, I take it back.<br />
<br />
At least their twitter mentions it, which I'm sure not many actual players follow. <br />

Why is it communication with their paying customers on their own fucking website is so fucking challenging? My first question would be &quot;When do the bulldozers arrive that will help you collectively pull your heads out of your collective asses?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
While BFA has been a decent expansion at it's core why did bugs that were consistently reported during the Beta not fixed?<br />
<br />
Such as Warfronts despawning?<br />
<br />
Either that or....<br />
<br />
Why has their been a lack of clarity/communication on systems post BFA launch such as Warfronts, the Mythic + cache and PvP/Mythic + in general?<br />
<br />
I mean we all know the questions will be cherry picked anyway to either avoid critical ones. Similar to how the Q and As are handled.</div></div><hr />

Sadly Blizzard only ever really admit to the soft mistakes rather than the big ones. They really need to take a leaf out of some other devs books when it comes to communication with players imo.<br />

Don't trash talk your own product ofc. Know where it's faults/low points lie, admit to them in a critical/constructive manner and then improve upon them.<br />
<br />
People are critical of Islands at the moment. Try and see where they are coming from rather than go &quot;oh people do it so it's obviously good content&quot;. No. It awards 2.5k Azerite at the end so it's popular. Not good. It's a carrot on the stick.<br />
<br />
I'd love some more honesty and critical insight from them but sadly they seem to lack that imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not either, because it will be a deluge of nitpicking and minutia. They need to come clean about some big picture issues, like:<br />
<br />
• Will azerite be worth it in the long run?<br />
• Why is everything so threadbare right now?<br />
• Who fucked up warfronts so badly, and what else are you planning on doing to fix them? <br />
<br />
What I don't expect is:<br />
<br />
&quot;We fucked up, our bad.&quot; They don't do that until after the expansion is done.<br />
&quot;We are scrapping [unpopular feature].&quot; They don't do that, at all. Think Ashran, that changed so much, and so often, it gave people whiplash.<br />
&quot;We will [doing someone that makes sense and pleases everyone].&quot; Because they really don't do that.<br />
<br />
What I DO expect is:<br />
&quot;Yeah, we need to get better at [something]'&quot;<br />
&quot;We disagree, we think [feature] is working fine, our internal metrics (that we'll never show you) show opposite.&quot;<br />
&quot;Working as intended, you just don't understand our vision for the game (that we won't tell you anything about, figure it out, git gud).&quot; <br />
<br />
Ion can't do more than appease and spin his usual lawyerly bullshit, because anything else might drive away customers. His job here is to get people to buy BfA and keep paying a monthly fee, and that's the bullshit he'll spin. Fluff and nonsense. He doesn't DO hard questions, he never has, and never will. <br />
<br />
I honestly think they're doing an AMA because it won't drive traffic to their tissue paper servers that host their forums, and they don't want to spend any money beefing them up. Yes, I'm cynical as fuck, but I earned it, I paid for WoD.<br />

The other way around: Ion expects you to provide at least some detail to your question.<br />
<br />
I would ask something like &quot;Can we get disarm abilities back? I always felt good disarming mobs in dungeons and feel that would be a good addition to mythic+ tactics because it makes me decide between spending a gcd on damage or lowering pressure on the tank&quot;.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, for half the people here not singing praises of their deities at blizzard is the defintion of being toxic. When things have issues is therefore automatically things being &quot;toxic&quot;.<br />

Most likely.<br />
<br />
Then again, it's much easier and faster to answer a question that does't require you to tiptoe around a minefield + can actually be sufficiently answered in a short paragraph; compared to rather hard questions that require extensive responses and where every wrong word will haunt you for months to come.<br />
<br />
I mean answering: &quot;What is your favorite quest in BfA&quot;, is much easier and has MUCH less possible complications. <br />

they will probably have sub mods deleting &quot;hard&quot; questions on the fly to make the AMA looks more decent but overall, it's gonna be an absolute shit show.<br />

So many launch bugs; both pre patch and actual launch, the mythic + box fiasco, which was never really fixed as people went into this week with high keys and loot still, the Mythic boxes only containing 1 piece of gear instead of up to 3 like on the beta never clarified until after they started being opened, weak follower board, island expeditions, and Warfront experiences, the whole Warfront fiasco which again was never clarified, and then allowed to be farmed by Horde for a few days with no ilvl requirement then implemented but the gear not stripped and (doubtfully) will be equalized for the Alliance, and so on.<br />
<br />
Just tons and tons of issues that were reported in beta and even if they weren't, should have been caught by an internal quality control team. It's fairly inexcusable for things like these to happen so regularly in a triple A company.</div></div><hr />

You mean because people chewed you out for attacking a dev for no actual reason?<br />
<br />
That's not what a fanboy is. There is never any reason to insult a game developer whatsoever.<br />
<br />
If you have to insult a dev themselves over the game then it's clear it goes beyond disliking/being critical of the game.<br />
<br />
Ask an actual critical question. Something you are disdained about in a mature/constructive manner.</div></div><hr />

Mount/Pet/Vanity drops seem so low as to be nonexistent, given there are 300 of them. Additionally, needing 40,000 azerite for the weekly quest feels a bit like a chore, especially given that the vanity rewards aren't hooking people. Maybe reduce it to 30k or 25k?<br />
<br />
2) Can you explain the design intention behind nerfing the Refer-a-Friend xp bonus? It was a system that people a) pay for, and b) opt-in to. Time was specifically spent nerfing it dramatically. Why? Who was this intended to reign in, and why was that determined to be a priority?<br />
<br />
3) Are there plans to introduce player housing at some point? There are a lot of people who would enjoy content not tied to the gear-progression system. You could make an entirely new secondary profession to create furnishings (carpenter/whatever) and/or gather materials (lumber harvest from WoD). You could sprinkle recipes thoughout pve and even pvp content. FF does this and it works pretty great.<br />
<br />
4) Every new class since vanilla has been a hybrid. Why? What does this say about the value of pure-dps classes like mage/warlock/rogue/hunter? Would they stand to be improved by the creation of a new role for them? Example: Survival spec of Hunter. The vast majority of hunter players did not ask for a melee spec, but if they were going to get one, why wasn't it a tanking spec? The Survival hunter rides a pet into battle, using a polearm like a jousting knight. Maybe charge and/or trample mechanics are the main focus. Maybe damage mitigation is stylized through the pet/mount's defenses.</div></div><hr />

While I think that is possible, i think this AMA is happening because of the bad state of the game, so i do not think it's in their best interest to answer easy questions. I hope they answer some tough ones like: warfronts are too easy, and that is completely putting them under, how do you guys intend to fix it? or Why are there so many bugs that went unfixed? <br />
<br />
I personally would ask them why they just dont treat warfronts like raids. Have heroic and mythic difficulties, make loot drop per phases and put them on a weekly lock out maybe.</div></div><hr />

Many people are doing them just to get the weekly Azerite cap because they aren't rewarding enough to continually run.<br />
<br />
2) Are there plans to either nerf the amount of mobs, nerf the health of mobs or both in Island Expeditions? Most of the complaints I hear about this mode are that the non-AI mobs take too long to kill and that there are far too many of them.<br />
<br />
3) Are there any plans to make the current iteration of Warfronts harder or, barring that, adding Heroic and Mythic difficulties to Warfronts? While the mode has potential, its current iteration makes it boring for players with even moderate skill and encourages AFKing. <br />
<br />
4) Are there plans to streamline the Azerite system? Currently, Azerite Armor feels clunky from numerous angles: it requires researching each pieces of gear to see which trait is best for your spec, it requires maintaining multiple pieces of each gear slot of Azerite Armor even if you play one spec (For example, as a Mistweaver Monk, I have to maintain different Azerite pieces based on if I'm in M+ or Raid), and new pieces of Azerite gear often don't feel like an upgrade if you don't have multiple traits unlocked on the new piece. <br />
<br />

World quests were just as bad then as they are now, gearing was stupid, factions were imbalanced, and the content was too short.<br />
<br />
Realistically there was maybe 4 hours of post-launch quest content that was added, just gated.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tyrannica</div><div class="date">2018-09-14, 05:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any plans to vastly expand, enrich and improve the classes? In BfA they feel extremely neutered, empty, oversimplified, gutted, boring and lame compared to MOP-era.<br />
<br />
Frankly that would be my question.<br />
<br />
Thats a very good question!<br />
<br />
If you look at metacritic MoP was rated the worst expansion, even before cata and wod and its release was similar boring as BfA ones, now BfA took over its spot as the worst expansion, but its still early enough for some major improvements.<br />
<br />
But the thing that was going for MoP was its class design. Its class revamp was perfectly done. Especially demo/destro warlock, shadow priest and druid comes to mind. A lot of creativeness and new abilities/talent to use there.<br />
<br />
BfA release was bland, with a very bad class design and zero inovations.<br />
<br />
My second question would be why scaling got overboard in BfA?<br />
<br />
Not just that mobs got more HP if you gain ilvls, they seem to hit way harder, too! you notice it more when playing a rogue, who never was great in big pulls. without cds like evasion there is a major problem suriving just few normal WQ mob pulls of 2-3 units. Maybe their hits are scaled to a percentage to your hp and dodge and parry seem not to work at all either, anymore for dd melee classes.<br />
<br />
Another weird scaling problem is pvp. A naked char is doing more dmg than a geared one due to scaling. I a saw a boomkin video proofing that but it got quickly deleted on twich. dmg is % based on hp bars making staminia and primary stats useless or actually even a problematic stat in case of staminia as healers simply have to heal bigger hp pools more as heals are not % based unlike dmg.<br />
<br />
So other than secondary stats and azerite traits gear does not matter at all in pvp.<br />
<br />
I think the incentive to collect gear in pvp should be much higher than that.<br />
<br />
<br />
My last question would be why frost dks do zero dmg in pvp, even though they are slow and have very weakened def cds(see ams nerfs), cant heal well and lack cc? While in pve they do a ton of dmg/dps?<br />
<br />
Clearly a big oversight, and i do not even play dks anymore, but i do think FDKs are the worst spec in pvp, its actually trash.<br />
<br />
Also the class overall got its most important def cds all in blood, and thats not a good design for this class fantasy of slow, but powerful, and only comes true to blood, only.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;past few weeks&quot; hmm and the expansion came out recently. hmm. Just doesn't add up!<br />
hmmm, let me think on this.</div></div><hr />

Not going to create an account just for that, they already got me on Twitter.</div></div><hr />

They already said it won't be a sticky.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, the thread is up and it's time to get your questions in: https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9fv4tk/im_world_of_warcraft_game_director_ion/</div></div><hr />

I actually have a feeling this might be addressed at the Q&amp;A in some shape or form. It makes no sense to announce something at Blizzcon that is already public knowledge.</div></div><hr />

Oh right, releasing that info at Blizzcon does sound much more likely.</div></div><hr />
