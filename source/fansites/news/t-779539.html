This hurts us a lot in raids. They can stand directly in front of you, they can repeatedly stand in front of you and use a ranged attack, why can't Hunters do the same thing and stack near the boss?<br />
A: It's a theme for the class. Larger hit boxes on bosses cause a problem, and that's something we'd like to address. <br />
Well is there something to be done to give us an advantage for that?<br />
You can shoot while moving for one, mages can't do that. Rogues can't really do anything while running from spot a to spot b, but you can. Different classes, different situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Minimum range for a hunter has got to be dumbest idea theoretically in the whole game. I can shoot you easier if you were closer to me than if you were farther away... Way to avoid common sense. And don't act like you're &quot;giving&quot; us the ability to shoot while moving. Back to theory. A person with a gun can shoot while moving, captain obvious.</div></div><hr />

Gun and Crossbow, you are correct.<br />
<br />
A standard Bow, you are wrong.<br />
<br />
If you have a bow and someone is up in your face hitting you with a giant hammer... you're gonna find it pretty hard to get a decent shot off.<br />
<br />
Guns and Crossbows on the otherhand are usually pre-loaded and therefore don't require as much focus.</div></div><hr />

Q: At the beginning of the patch, were you surprised by how little threat generation there was for warrior tanking? Tanking in ICC I still have an issue with keeping the AoE threat going. I always feel like I have to constantly hit Rend and Thunderclap.<br />

This. People are bitching at the biggest event of the year for WoW instead of asking questions on different possibilities for the future of classes like &quot;any plans to add an &quot;X&quot; type of move or let this melee class equip polearms?&quot;<br />
<br />
The whiniest MMO community shows up to their own event and whines, who would have thought. Just disappointing that people find it in themselves to bitch at the expense of other people's opportunities to as legitimate questions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most hunters want to be like Legolas on top of the troll still shooting away. I can't blame them, minimum range limitation is lame. The 90% of the time it makes sense doesn't balance to the the trouble of fights with big hitboxes stupid. <br />
<br />
For all of the silly WoWisms that Blizz has removed over the years, this one should have happened long ago (or at the least made so they're melee competent with the same abilities).</div></div><hr />

<br />
We also tried to make the tree fun and unique compared to the other tanks, like with the DK mastery. <br />
Yeah unique cos feral tanking mastery isn't almost the exact same principle.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think players have grasped the best way to use it yet. In beta we see Ferals putting mushrooms where adds spawn, then detonate when they spawn. That's a pretty good use of it.<br />
<br />
The gameplay though is that you have to stack them if you want to do good burst damage.<br />
Grats on completely sidestepping the question. Is this guy a politician or something?<br />
<br />
<br />
You can shoot while moving for one, mages can't do that.<br />
Actually they can.<br />
<br />
<br />
With mastery we're trying to really give each spec that feeling of awesome for their specific style of play. We want to change your gameplay up with mastery<br />
Oh like extra damage on fire dots? Extra damage on bleed dots? Extra frost damage? Extra disease damage? Extra damage in eclipse (that isn't worth shit compared to other stats)? Random wild quiver procs? Extra pet damage? Extra elemental damage? Extra block chance? Extra absorb strength? Random hots on direct heals? Extra poison damage?<br />
OK you get the point 90% of masteries do NOTHING to gameplay.<br />
<br />
Not even going into what they've been saying about paladins, they've done a good enough job of fucking that up themselves.</div></div><hr />

The response was to an actual shadow priest question but of course you're right. For spriests though the only thing mastery changes is it lowers your overall damage output because haste in crit is still vastly superior since mind blast is just a small part of our damage. The way to go with mastery in line with their reasoning would not be as a passive boost to your strongest abilites / worst abilites as they seem to do now but to give procs etc to stuff that really changes the way you play. now it's just a boring gimmick stat. Given how much of the damn stuff theyre putting on the end game gear it's discouraging to say the least for us shadow priests</div></div><hr />

We decided mana feels good until it runs out. It's dependable over short periods of time then it goes away. The idea was &quot;Oh the mana bar constantly goes down, then it gets filled again.&quot; You were playing off of cooldowns, playing whack-a-mole.<br />

It's sort of reducing how many Crusader Strikes we can generate (wat?). Do you feel it's clashing, or that you'll reevaluate it as a talent? <br />
<br />
A: We're looking at it. Some people claim it's not a dps increase at all, but we're confused by that. We might change it so Divine Purpose procs 3 Holy Power while Zealotry is up. <br />
<br />
<br />
It's not a DPS increase, because due to the cooldowns and the new shitty (it is) queue system we can't literally use everything we have let alone using zealotry which you need 3 holy power to use, just is useless at the moment in DPS terms. As any retribution paladin will have seen in the new changes (which i like bar Zealotry but i said that in the PTR) is 5-10 seconds into the fight the entire action bar lights up like the christmas tree once the procs start coming in.<br />
<br />
we literally can't get our the DPS fast enough with the current mechanics with Zealotry. If they had combined it with Avenging Wrath then yeah i'd see it.. but it's just ugh, i don't even need to use it for heroics or anything, because holy power wise i'm proc'ing like crazy and can't do enough. just poorly worked out (much like the certain numbers this patch... still can't believe the fix they did with our hammer of righteousness and avenging wrath lol just madness. We can pretty much get 60k+ of damage out with 4 button presses, and 3 of those are the same button, works best with divine shield up and /dance)<br />
<br />
what scares me, my DPS is usually measure on - hammer of righteousness, crusader strike, exorcism and templars verdict a 4th spot. At the moment exorcism feels more like a caster spell than well a paladin &quot;EXORCISM&quot; spell. <br />
<br />
rather than fix the broken retribution (it is, even complaints coming in at level 85), they're hotfixing issues as they come up. We're not the only class having issues along these lines though... as always the warrior is not far behind us (they have major dps issues)</div></div><hr />

People are bitching at the biggest event of the year for WoW instead of asking questions on different possibilities for the future of classes like &quot;any plans to add an &quot;X&quot; type of move or let this melee class equip polearms?&quot;<br />
<br />
The whiniest MMO community shows up to their own event and whines, who would have thought. Just disappointing that people find it in themselves to bitch at the expense of other people's opportunities to as legitimate questions.<br />
And how do you expect them to answer all that? Read GS. He tries hard to be a politician when commenting on very specific aspects of the game and after couple months... half of what he says appears to be a complete bu****it despite his tries. Imagine them talking about some crazy ideas people deliver to them in questions. We have cata coming in a month and people are interested in their classes. People are realistic and don't expect blizzard to think about rocketjumps as &quot;X&quot; type moves for paladins with cata at the door.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well he is right<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well is there something to be done to give us an advantage for that?<br />
You can shoot while moving for one, mages can't do that. Rogues can't really do anything while running from spot a to spot b, but you can. Different classes, different situations. <br />
<br />
Ice lance and scorch would both like to say hi. Did he honestly just compare a melee class to a ranged dps class. Sure rogues can't do much, they aren't in melee range. Guess what, most melee can't do melee damage while not in melee range? Do you see a pattern? <br />
<br />
I don't think these people actually know what is going on in their game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey there, honestly I am glad after reading this thread to see that no one is really bashing the question. I'd be a little upset (lol) since it was me that asked it.<br />
<br />
I think what GC was referencing was the fact that at 83 we get aspect of the fox, allowing us to autoshot and (I think) steady shot while moving.<br />
<br />
This takes us out of aspect of the hawk losing us both the added AP and the focus regen of the shot.<br />
<br />
My question wasn't really answered, I asked the followup because honestly it's not a class feature, it's a limitation and it's an antiquated one that serves no purpose. It's arbitrary and limiting and the hunter gains NO benefit to balance the limitation.<br />
<br />
I asked if they could explain WHY it still exists and was told it's a class uniqueness thing.<br />
I asked what benefit was given (or would be given) to balance out the negative it inflicts and was told that we can shoot while moving and we have things to get out of melee, neither which pertained to my question. He also mentioned being hit in the face which would make sense in PVP but I specifically referenced PVE raiding and fights like Lord Marrowgar... If Marrowgar is TARGETING me I'm dead, range or not. I don't see how distance to target makes any difference if I am shooting him in the back. No more so than a warlock casting a shadow bolt or a mage casting scorch<br />

Ice Lance, Scorch, Every instant cast DoT, Shamans new spell<br />
<br />
Hunters can cast their instant attacks while moving, can't auto shot or steady shot without aspect of the fox and that's a dps loss.<br />

All I'm hearing is hunter tears, you kids need your deadzone back so that good hunters don't absolutely faceroll every class as is. Ridiculous damage coupled with a ton of ezmode abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So we should keep a useless and antiquated mechanic that negatively impacts the class design itself because without it people can't beat hunters in PVP?<br />
<br />
If your losing to hunters in PVP I highly doubt that small change is going to have any effect on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When are we going to see a new class? Its been 6 years and we only seen 1 new class which was deathknights.<br />
<br />
Also why didnt they make Worgen and Goblins a neutral race?<br />
<br />
Are we going to see tauka skins when we create taurens?<br />
<br />
Are we going to play as the Walrus Race from Northrend? <br />
<br />
Why can't we command our elementals like hunters do with pets?<br />
<br />
When are we going to see combo abilities used? ex: A mage, warlock and priest can combine there attacks for a awesome powerful one. This can also apply to dps, tanks healers etc.<br />
<br />
Why cant we customize our capes with our guild name and logo?<br />
<br />
What about tattoos?</div></div><hr />

Back to theory. A person with a gun can shoot while moving, captain obvious.<br />
<br />
Minimum range for a hunter makes perfect sense, you cant use a 'real' (x)bow in melee range, you'd need at least a few inches of traveltime on an arrow or bolt or there'd be no momentum in the projectile.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, we could make it like this simply to make it happy.<br />
When you move, you get a lingering debuff that reduces your chance to hit by 75%, you regain 25% of those every second, so if you want to run and hit every attack you need 18+75% hit bonus.<br />
If you stand still for 1 second, you can attack again, as you regain your aim.<br />
That would be logical.<br />
<br />
As for melee range shooting, every held a rifle? or a bow?, what you're speaking of is a gun, yes with a gun you would be able to hit more easily in melee, however using a bow or a rifle the turnspeed would be so much higher, your flexibility would be less meaning once they are to close to you, you would be unable to attack.<br />
However this could also be changed, just that the area of &quot;Your target has to be in front&quot; would be allot more narrow.<br />
So instead of like now having a 90 degree area where you are facing your opponent, you would have a 10 degree.<br />
So once they get close you would effectively get the same effect, unless they stand completely still.<br />
<br />
Happy now?<br />
<br />
Or, you could just have it as it is because that's in theory how one would likely seem to have it in a game such as world of warcraft.</div></div><hr />

Are you SERIOUS?????? Who will ask a question Like that?

I disagree. If you shoot someone up close with a hunting rifle the projectile is likely to go right through. It'll still do damage, but less damage than if the projectile got inside and moved around the organs a little.</div></div><hr />

This just in, Warcraft is a fantasy game... there's no such thing as Mages in real life... remove them from the game...<br />
<br />
P.S. Have you ever tried to shoot a gun on the move? Since we're using real life mechanics, your chance to miss just quadrupled. Physics and body mechanics aren't so cool now, are they?</div></div><hr />

I was actually pretty curious about the feral talent &quot;Stampede&quot;. The line was far too long for me to get it in the panel though.<br />
&quot;Would there ever be a chance in the future to possibly add 2-3 stacks to the stampede buff when using feral charge in Cat Form as currently it feels a bit... lackluster.&quot;<br />
<br />
My reasoning for asking this is that on the beta there was a bug for quite a while(I'm not sure if it's still in effect) that when you use Feral Charge(cat), stampede doesn't leave until the 8 seconds has passed enabling you to use Ravage anywhere from 1-8 times(assuming you can spam it enough). I do understand this would be a bit overpowered as you can crit for 12k on a player with ravage(regularly about 7k hits) at level 85 in blue gear. Which seems like a lot right now but really isn't when you take into account that players have over 90k hp at level 85 in blues. 1 Ravage doesn't feel like enough to really make the talent special, and 8 seems like too many to me. 2-3 would be incredible.</div></div><hr />

I started playing a hunter back in BC. Honestly, I have to say that I have NEVER seen a range issue when fighting. As a hunter I always try to keep range and if I cannot, I simply melee (with the expectation my attacking will not be as powerful since mine is NOT a melee class). I really do not see an issue here.</div></div><hr />
