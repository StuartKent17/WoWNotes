Patch 5.4 -Skeletal Warhorse and Warsaber Mounts<br />
Patch 5.4 adds two new PvP mounts, the http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/102533.jpg Reins of the Vicious Skeletal Warhorse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102533-reins-of-the-vicious-skeletal-warhorse) and http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/102514.jpg Reins of the Vicious Warsaber (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102514-reins-of-the-vicious-warsaber). <br />
<br />
Currently, the mounts are sold by Netharian (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/73151-netharian). on the PTR for a http://media-azeroth.cursecdn.com/icons/items/16/102535.jpg Vicious War Saddle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/102535-vicious-war-saddle), but it isn't very clear where those come from yet though, as we saw two different answers on the same day from two developers:<br />

Patch 5.4 In Game Store Update<br />
It looks like the Asian regions will be the first to be able to purchase faster leveling and Lesser Charms!<br />
Thanks for all the feedback so far, everyone. We’re still pretty early in the exploration process, but we did want to go into more detail about our rationale for introducing an in-game store, as well as provide some insight into what you might ultimately see available there.<br />
<br />
For players who are already interested in the in-game items we offer, such as Pet Store pets and mounts, the benefits of an in-game store are pretty clear. We think everyone would appreciate the convenience of being able to make such purchases without having to leave the game, and ultimately that’s our long-term goal for the system, though there’s quite a bit of work involved in retrofitting those existing items into the new system. <br />
<br />
First, we’ll be testing the in-game store with some new kinds of items we’re looking into introducing (in Asian regions, at the outset) based on player feedback: specifically, an experience buff to assist with the leveling process (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/146939-enduring-elixir-of-wisdom), as well as an alternate way to acquire Lesser Charms of Good Fortune (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/738-lesser-charm-of-good-fortune). We’ve had a lot of requests from players in different regions for convenience-oriented items such as these, and as with other new ideas we’ve introduced as WoW has evolved—including Pet Store pets, mounts, and more—your feedback plays a hugely important part in determining what we add to the game.<br />
<br />
Ultimately it’s still too early in the process to make any final determinations about our plans, but in the meantime, we hope you’ll check out the in-game store once it’s implemented on the PTR and let us know what you think. <br />
<br />

Legendary Cloak Effects<br />
Legendary Cloak Effects and Druid/Warlock Forms<br />
As the legendary spell effects are tied to the procs and not the cloak graphics themselves, they will still display even if your cloak is hidden. That includes Druid forms.<br />
<br />
How's it work with Meta for demo locks I wonder? I'd love to know it's all gonna be smooth sailing <br />
I haven't confirmed Meta form specifically, but I don't see why it wouldn't work.<br />
<br />
Will players that haven't been doing the quests or chose to level a new character have a chance at getting these cloaks? <br />
You won't get them quite as quickly as someone who's already on the most recent step of the quest chain when 5.4 releases, but we do have plans to shorten the amount of time it takes to &quot;catch up.&quot; We made similar changes for the 5.0 steps of the chain when 5.2 launched. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/263904-legendary-cloak-effects/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9423803313?page=1#16))<br />
<br />
Legendary Cloak and Transmogrification<br />
How many of you are concerned that legacy legendaries will become the new Paladin Tier 2, in that everyone and his dog will be equipping them? Wouldn't it somehow ruin the novelty of owning these items when you get to see them being used constantly, even by levelling characters? Alright, I guess the argument for items that aren't available anymore is a little stronger in my eyes. <br />
<br />
But hey, we're not ruling it out completely—one day, who knows? We purposefully made it very limited when transmogrification started, so we could maybe open things up further down the road. I've seen plenty of people argue against this is all.<br />
<br />
I mean, allowing players to transmog into legendaries isn't gonna automatically increase the number of players having, say, Thunderfury <br />
Are you sure? One of the reasons I've never gone for the Twin Blades of Azzinoth is because I know I wouldn't be able to show them off constantly. All that work for a few minutes posing in Stormwind? But if I could transmogrify them, I'd be in BT every waking moment trying for those things, and I think there'd be a few more like me. Just a guess, of course. At least now when you see someone taking those few minutes to /flex in the city with those awesome old school legendaries, you're impressed. Well, I am.

Patch 5.4 Hunter Updates<br />
As I've mentioned before, we're still discussing Hunter concerns. When we have an update, we will share it.<br />
I said this 5 days ago, before a holiday weekend. We haven't somehow jumped ahead several weeks in development while everyone's been out of the office.<br />
<br />
I know it can be frustrating to be patient, but that's just how our development process works. We're still pretty early in that process. As I've mentioned before, balance tuning typically takes place towards the end of the PTR cycle. Hunter sustained DPS in the wake of the Readiness nerf is a concern that we're well aware of and fully intend to fix -- when we get to that point.<br />
<br />
For clarity: we know there are other issues than just Readiness. Arcane Shot vs Kill Command is one such issue that, again, we intend to fix. I will make sure to bring up the other concerns to the team as well.<br />
<br />
He can be our man on the inside and a champion for our class. It would be risky and challenging, but, if he cares about this game and us, he absolutely should do it. If I could walk down the hall and force Greg to hear these issues I would do so in a heartbeat. <br />
This is starting to get pretty off-topic, and I apologize, but I want to be clear: this is exactly what I do. Daily. For every class. My job as a World of Warcraft Community Representative, as it turns out, is to represent the community. I take my job very seriously. We all do.<br />
<br />
I know all too well how frustrating it can be when you're concerned about something and it appears that we're being silent. I was in those shoes myself until very recently. Just please be aware that silence isn't necessarily a bad thing. In many cases, including this one, it means we're still actively discussing things and just don't have anything we're comfortable sharing yet.<br />
<br />
We really do appreciate all of the feedback, both on Hunter concerns as well as how we can communicate better. This thread in particular should probably stick to Hunter concerns, but I want to be the very best (like no one ever was) and can always work to improve how we interact with you guys.<br />
<br />
Alright, I have a few updates, followed by a request. Here’s what the developers are currently thinking about several of the issues brought up in this thread:<br />
<br />
Regarding Stampede: We’re happy with the damage it’s currently putting out in PvP. For PvE, we’re planning to buff its damage pretty heavily, so it becomes a substantially more potent DPS cooldown. We don’t want to give it any more utility than it has now, for reasons we’ve explained at length already.<br />
<br />
Readiness is still under heavy discussion, and we haven’t made a final decision on what we’re going to do with it in 5.4. At the moment, we’re leaning towards just removing the ability entirely and giving the affected abilities shorter cooldowns or charges to compensate. If we end up taking that route, we will buff Hunter damage (most likely across the board, not just specific abilities), but as I mentioned, we’re still discussing.<br />
<br />
Murder of Crows vs Blink strike is also still under heavy discussion. Our goal (with all talents) is that active abilities used properly will outperform passive ones. We haven’t decided yet what adjustments we’ll make to achieve that in 5.4.<br />
<br />
Scatter/Silencing Shot: We don’t consider interrupts to be mandatory in PvE. If a Hunter would rather not take the Glyph of Scattered Thoughts, there are plenty of other players in the raid who could take on the responsibility. We like Silencing Shot as a Marksman perk overall, but we’re still discussing things. We may end up making a baseline Interrupting Shot that gets upgraded to Silencing Shot if you spec Marksman.<br />
<br />
Speaking of spec differences, we agree that Hunter rotations feel cooler when your signature shots do a lot more damage than other shots, and we’ll discuss that some more. That’s part of the reasoning behind the Arcane Shot changes – our hope is that saving up more Focus for a bigger hit will feel better than firing off smaller shots more regularly. <br />
<br />
As to overall Hunter performance and utility, we don’t think the issues are with the Hunter class specifically. Instead, we think that certain other classes are overperforming (in both) at the moment. Fixing those outliers will, in turn, make a good Hunter more attractive for their raid spot. You may have seen some (but not all) changes along those lines on the PTR already.<br />
<br />
Pet pathing errors are unfortunately extremely difficult to fix. A lot of the time, the problem isn’t with the pet AI but with the environment or encounter. That means there’s no blanket fix here; we have to resolve every such error individually. When reporting these problems, it’s most helpful to be very specific. “My pet has trouble getting to the boss during this phase transition on this encounter” allows us to reproduce the issue and come up with a fix. “My pet is dumb” does not.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my request. This thread has a lot of great feedback put together by a good handful of Hunters who just want their class to be fun – which is amazing! The issue is that, in order to find those helpful posts, we have to dig through hundreds of other posts that contain no helpful information whatsoever (and instead focus on how class X got more blue posts this week, or employee Y must just hate Hunters, etc.). There’s always going to be some of that, and we expect as much, but this thread has been particularly out of hand.<br />
<br />
I’m not bringing that up because it hurts my feelings or whatever. That sort of thing doesn’t really affect me. I’m bringing it up because it makes it incredibly difficult for us to figure out what you’re actually upset about. When we have to sift through so much noise just to find something we can actually bring up in our meetings and discuss, the end result is that we have less to talk about in our meetings. I’m sure there are still some concerns that I didn’t address above – if that’s the case, it’s 100% because they got lost in the pile. That sucks.<br />
<br />
So please, try to keep things constructive. You’re only hurting yourselves and your fellow Hunters otherwise. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/263649-readiness-nerf-and-hunter-pve-pt2/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/9377368613?page=35#697))<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Burnick</div><div class="date">2013-07-09, 07:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TL;DR : I quit if haste pally is hurt bad, I know noone cares, but I enjoy this game alot, but don't enjoy being replaced because my class/build took nerf bat to face and i couldnt replace gear in time to be valid. Prot pallys now feel unique to me, only class Im truly good at, if they know longer feel fun to me then I'll no longer wanna play.<br />
<br />
I've never played Prot paladin and enjoyed as much as I have since I have started to tank again during 5.2/5.3 I feel that us stacking haste, doing a decent amount of healing, and more depending on your gear, the amount of haste you get up to ect. The amount of damage you can do dependent on this, the unique feel to it, the low down time that makes it feel for fluent and full and not boring at all. I remember tanking during ICC, and how the only reason I did not reroll, Is at the time it was the only class and spec I really knew how to play, what I was truly good at and still am. Back then I didn't really enjoy it thou, but now I do. But if I end up not enjoying the one thing I am really great at in WoW, Prot paladin tanking the Im quitting. This happened to me with mages at the start of MoP, leveled one to 90, went fire, spent 80,000 gold gearing it out to raid with my guild, fire gets nerfed for that patch because it then required insane amounts of gear I'd never obtain and I did not enjoy other mage specs. <br />
<br />
So I'll be quite honest if these changes to paladins glyph of battle healer and grand crusader, greatly impact the haste build for paladins I'll once again be leaving the came, if I can not get the gear appropriate in time for next patch. When fire mages were still greatly valid in 5.1 I leveled a mage to 90, and spent 80k gearing it out to raid with my guild just for it to get nerfed to the point it was no longer valid for the gear of that patch because fire is the only mage spec I enjoy I quit the game. why would they damage something that almost every single paladin builds into? If this reaally harms the build, there is going to be alot of people being replaced from their raid teams ect.<br />
<br />
Now they are possibly doing the same? so if this really hurts haste build, and i can't get regeared in time for 5.4 I quit. I really hate quitting this game, I enjoy raiding, enjoy hanging with guild member ect, hell I even now enjoy actually doing daily quest and farming for rep some what. But what I don't enjoy, is getting the nerf bat and no longer being valid, so noone no longer takes me to raids cause Im taking a ton of damage/dont do enough damage/ect ect.</div></div><hr />

You don't want that.<br />
<br />
You must be unfamiliar with other MMOs with an ingame shop. As long as they're only selling cosmetic / quality of life stuff there aren't any issues at all. Look at the Blizzard Store we have right now, it only sells mounts and pets. Until you can buy full heroic / elite gear it isn't pay to win, period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks fo' all tha feedback so far, everyone. We’re still pretty early up in tha exploration process yo, but our phat asses did wanna go tha fuck into mo' detail bout our rationale fo' introducin a in-game store, as well as provide some insight tha fuck into what tha fuck you might ultimately peep available there.<br />
<br />
For playas whoz ass is already horny bout tha in-game shit we offer, like fuckin Pet Store pets n' mounts, tha benefitz of a in-game store is pretty clear. Shiiit, dis aint no joke. We be thinkin mah playas would appreciate tha convenience of bein able ta make such purchases without havin ta leave tha game, n' ultimately that’s our long-term goal fo' tha system, though there’s like a lil' bit of work involved up in retrofittin dem existin shit tha fuck into tha freshly smoked up system. <br />
<br />
First, we’ll be testin tha in-game store wit some freshly smoked up kindz of shit we’re lookin tha fuck into introducin (in Asian regions, all up in tha outset) based on playa feedback: specifically, a experience buff ta assist wit tha levelin process (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/146939-enduring-elixir-of-wisdom), as well as a alternate way ta acquire Lesser Charmz of Dope Fortune (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/738-lesser-charm-of-good-fortune). We’ve had a shitload of requests from playas up in different regions fo' convenience-oriented shit like fuckin these, n' as wit other freshly smoked up scams we’ve introduced as WoW has evolved --- &quot;includin Pet Store pets, mounts, n' more---&quot;your feedback skits a hugely blingin part up in determinin what tha fuck we add ta tha game.<br />
<br />
Ultimately it’s still too early up in tha process ta make any final determinations bout our plans yo, but up in tha meantime, our crazy asses hope you’ll check up tha in-game store once it’s implemented on tha PTR n' let our asses know what tha fuck you think.</div></div><hr />

If only it was that simple, there might be some circumstances that doesn't allow people to do them. For example, I'm profoundly deaf and nobody want to invite me to RBG as I can't use the vent. And I want that wolf mount so bad!</div></div><hr />

I bought the game. I should have all that crap by default minus access to instances/pvp thankyou very much.<br />

As for paying twice for the game.... How many of us have bought a bat, or a winged lion, or a sparkle horse? They're not much cheaper than an expansion...</div></div><hr />

Do they? It seems a flat out nerf to me. :)<br />
Currently, on live, we don't have any burst.<br />
But when RoRO procs, we get a chance to line up with the other damagedealers... Even do more damage than them...<br />
But no, let's change the mastery once again... Let's give monks even less chances to do a meaningful damage at any given time...<br />

<br />
i don't want meaningful gear or achievements to be for sale, but everything else that people buy already from 3rd parties is fine with me. so if blizzard gives someone the option to buy an xp boost maybe they take that instead of risking their info with a website leveling service. blizzard profits and prevents a customer service issue when people get scammed.<br />
<br />
the only items i might could accept being in the store would be toys, heirlooms, and transmogrification pieces. any more serious items would probably be crossing the line for my taste.</div></div><hr />

I'm fine with this for Asia, since they don't pay subs like we do and I'm also fine with the Framework for a shop that works via the ingame browser to provide the convenience of not having to log onto a website, as long as that shop isn't placed like &quot;IN your face!11&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowfyre27</div><div class="date">2013-07-09, 09:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My big issue with this &quot;in-game shop&quot; is that with them allowing you to purchase the lesser charms is that IMO Blizz is no longer tip toeing on the line between &quot;cosmetic&quot; purchasable items, like pets and mounts and buying items. With the inclusion of lesser charms, again IMO, they are now taking a step over that line and testing what the reaction is. To people who say that they still aren't selling gear I have to disagree with you. Anyone who doe's any kind of raiding be it LFR, Normal, or Heroic, we know that lesser charms = gear. It maybe an rng chance at gear but undeniably lesser charms = gear period. They previously stated they would not sell gear, and yet here they are trying to sneak it in by disguising with the lesser charms, and that is totally unacceptable.</div></div><hr />

Yep. They are testing how far we will let them go.<br />

Some people do seem to forget that if they are in fact implemented that they will make FoS server first leveling to X when expansions hit even sketchier. So in essence it might be considered pay to win for this instance. <br />

Blizz is getting ready to turn wow FTP fully by adding a in game store and with this 1st is the xp thing next is new mounts every patch then buying gold from them. some what like rift and swtor did. all mmos have to go ftp and well wow about fully play out because they cant keep patches rolling out when ppl would like and by like it go from every month to ever 2 weeks.<br />

I think I can say, with great confidence, that they'll either be disabled or unusable after level 90 when the next expansion releases to avoid interfering with Realm First levelling.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is doing the same and STILL expecting players to pay for login into the game. <br />
<br />
And we thought WOW was loosing subs fast.... There will be alot of players that will quit and never look back if Blizzard is just adding alternative ways to make money rather than actually doing something that benefits the constumer.<br />
<br />
The good thing about F2P games is that you are not forced to pay for login in. Instead those games use ingame stores to pay the bill. Blizzard is NOT doing that.... they are still milking the consumer and then adding the same microtransactions on top of that.<br />
<br />
But here is the deal.... If players are asking for something.... Why not implement it without forcing ppl to pay extra for it ?</div></div><hr />

No one is 'forcing' you to buy anything. Anyone that quits because they have an in-game store that sells some pets and mounts and things like xp pots and such and not things like gear and transmog and such are just people who cry over everything they think effects them. If you've gotten elder charms the way you have been, then obviously it's not hard to do, yet you're going to feel like you're 'forced' to pay for something you don't have to? Typical for people to look at things like this as the sky is falling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone that quits because WOW has adopted BOTH Sub and Micro transaction will do it based on the fact that you can now play games that dont force you to buy sub before login in. And THATS why those games have micro transaction. Player that sees both in WOW should question the game development and the integrity to develop a game based on either model.<br />
<br />
Its true that no person is forced to buy stuff in store.... but they are forced to buy sub to log on. The difference is that most the games out there have OPTION of one or the other. Not both. So unless Blizzard is willing to put the game up for F2P and dont force ppl to pay before login in... the consumer is loosing out compared to any other game that is on the market now. And believe it or not... the consumer is in most case not very stupid... Unless its fanboys that havn't realised what is happening in the MMO world around them.<br />
<br />
It sounds like they WILL be pushing charms into the store.. Those are ENDGAME ITEMS and are a way to require the best items in game. Even tho they are RNG .. its a clear cut Pay to Win. Specially considering they will probably ramp up the difficulty and boredom getting it RATHER than just making the experience fun and enjoyable.<br />
<br />
PAY TO WIN WILL BE A FACT IN WOW IF THAT HAPPENS.</div></div><hr />

Noone is forcing you to pay anything in F2P games either, but at least those game are subscription-free. WOW wont go F2P as Blizzards greedy owners want to have the cake and eat it too. Blizzard wants subscriptions and on top of that - a micro transaction in-game shop to milk the blue eyed fanboy cashcows even more. The wow community is stupid enough to let them have it both ways. Trust me, with this, we havent seen the end of greediness from Blizzard yet.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if serious...<br />
So imagine if you can pay to get your weekly 50 lesser charms.. you choose to get them that way...<br />
How exactly is it P2W when you are still, just like everyone else, limited to 3 runes per week?<br />

Are you sure you read the same blue post as the rest of us? Because it clearly states and I quote &quot;First, we’ll be testing the in-game store with some new kinds of items we’re looking into introducing (in Asian regions, at the outset) based on player feedback&quot;<br />
<br />
That part I made bold to point out what a lot of us are seeing as &quot;We will start with the Asian markets then we will bring it over to the other markets at a later point in time&quot;. That IMO and others, based on comments I've read is completely unacceptable.<br />
We aren't &quot;greasing the slippery slope&quot; we see the writing on the wall in clear blue lettering and pointing out to those who don't seem to see it. For me personally, let them sell that shit to the Asian market for all I care, over there that seems to be perfectly acceptable not to mention that unlike us they don't pay a monthly fee to play the game. In the US and EU we pay a monthly fee and for Blizzard to try and now sneak in selling gear, sorry but no, that is not acceptable. Yes, I said selling gear because that's exactly what it is when they sell the lesser charms for real money. In case your unaware here's how it works: Lesser Charmsx50 --&gt; 3 Elder Charms --&gt; Gear/No Gear. Now by selling those same lesser charms for real money they are selling you gear. Regardless of it's rng if you get lucky and get gear I see selling lesser charms as selling gear which they said they would not do and yet here they are doing just that. This slope is becoming less slippery and more just a straight slide.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The funny thing is that's pretty much what they are offering. Technically speaking by offering to sell lesser charms they are by proxy offering to sell you the best gear in game. You can't truthfully say that they aren't. As I pointed out lesser charms lead to a chance at gear. For heroic raiders this means that you can technically speaking purchase thunderforged heroic items. Is it a sure thing you will get a thunderforged heroic item? no, but then you can therefore it is by proxy technically selling BiS gear and that you can't say it isn't.<br />
<br />
As per the &quot;we'll never see this on western realms&quot; can you absolutely with 100% certainty say this? Are you the person behind this idea and therefore know exactly where it will be deployed? If not then you can't say for certain that it won't be done here. That is the point many of us are making. We want to make our voices loud and clear now before Blizzard gets anymore of an inkling that this will be acceptable here. They have made it clear to us that the Asian market is only the first place they want to implement this which infers they have plans for other markets as well. And yes I know this isn't the official forums but they are currently down and there's a discussion about here so we are voicing our opinions here currently.</div></div><hr />

This can be interpreted so broadly. Ultimately, everything in a game is convenience, everything in a game is optional, since the game itself is optional. This is what us naysayers were warning about when the first store mount launched - that ultimately, this would escalate in other items, other &quot;non essential&quot; items.<br />
<br />
&quot;Optional&quot;, however, as stated, can be broadly interpreted. Surely an EXP bonus is optional, like a mount. A piece of gear is also optional, you don't need it to play the game itself, do you not? Lesser charms -- optional too, right, as they only give extra chance on epics! <br />
<br />
Ultimately such a store undermines everything you can achieve in a game. It's self-destructing to a game: When you can buy with real money what you should be playing to get instead. This is *especially* the case in a subscription based game, where the subscription itself should be a substitute for an ingame store like free2play games have - Farmville, etc.<br />
<br />
Overall, as I argued a few years back when the first store mount was released (saying that &quot;only mounts and pets&quot; is a bad precedent, as it has proven to be), I will continue to be against this. Let players work for their stuff by actually playing the game, and when that work is too bothersome or annoying, then there is something wrong with the game design, and it should not mean it should just be sold for rl money instead.</div></div><hr />

Yes....in a f2p game I would tolerate that, but not when I'm paying a 13E a month sub.

Think of it it this way, they already do. It's called &quot;change appearance&quot;. I know it's not what you meant, but the point is there. You already have options to pay appearance. Mounts. Pets. Now they are dabbling in more....<br />

There are already too many skeletal horses in game. Perhaps there are too many nightsabres, too, but playing mainly Horde, I don't notice much regarding the Alliance.<br />
<br />
And I also have to say that this in-game store (or, more specifically the elixir) has really upset me. I'm usually quite pro Blizzard, because I believe they wouldn't do anything if they didn't have to. But this elixir has concerned me.<br />
If it will only work on levels 85+ then great. But to be able to use it from level 1, 10 or 30 or anything like that seems a bit much. There are almost enough heirlooms in game to fully kit you out. Oh no! Some heirlooms don't go past 80! Oh well, just deal with those last 10 levels without two or three of your heirlooms.<br />
<br />
What concerns me the most is that it's getting to the point now where it's all becoming a mad dash to the finish line. Perhaps it's just me, and perhaps most people want this, but I am concerned. The only thing that will set my mind at ease are restrictions, such as a minimum level needed to use the elixir rather than buy it. Call me selfish but it would ruin the game for me if other people were to be level 10 one day and level 90 three days later (that is, without insane grinding but just through casual-ish playing).<br />
<br />
Still, my voice alone won't change things, I know that, so I'm giving my 2c here. Hopefully Blizzard will give us more details before too long.</div></div><hr />

Is it because this is perceived as a precursor to Blizzard adding other items that players feel will turn the game into more of a (p2w) model with a sub? Maybe this is Blizzards way of trying out the micro transaction model in World of Warcraft to see how well it does so as to move away from the Subscription based model. I'm not sure if that's the goal, but from everything I've read online the Subscription based model isn't doing all that well, and it would seem that the f2p with a micro transaction store is the way to go.</div></div><hr />

The damn things are practically falling out of the skies these days, and I know no one in the US or EU is asking for it. I've got nearly 6000 of the damn things, and will likely have more than I need unless they're implemented as a mechanism in the next expansion.<br />
<br />
It's almost as if it's a pressing need for a market where people buy time and have the ability to play only by the hour, where the biggest MMO names are all F2P.<br />
<br />
You know, like Asia. Like the blue post says. <br />
<br />
Stop greasing the slippery slope, guys.<br />
<br />
If Lesser charms are easy to get now... doesn't mean that will be the case in 2 years time. And then you might need 1000 to just make one bigger one. Thats how these game claim they are making the game &quot;easier&quot; for players when in fact they can just develop it so that ppl are not forced to grind it. We can bet that we will see alot of grinding for lesser charms if they will be put into ingame store.<br />

I wouldn't mind dropping a few bucks to save some time leveling an alt.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind Blizzard then going back and rebalancing the game back to 50 lvls instead of 90 so that the leveling experience for EVERYONE is fun and enjoyable... not just for those that pay extra to get rid of the grind.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing is, and I've said this about other games, is that it's not really play 2 win, it's more play 2 speed up the process. If you want to take the slow and steady route to obtaining xp and charms, then you can, if you're willing to speed up the process, then there's a small fee. It's like how you pay to get into Universal Studios and then you can pay extra to jump to the front of every line. True pay 2 win would be &quot;$50 gets you an uber elite group of NPCs that will clear any heroic raid for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
It is pay to win. Imagine world first guilds spending hours upon hours grinding Lesser charms (Blizzard WILL increase the grind like every F2P game out there) when they can just buy them and spend more time on bosses. That would ofc be ok IF ppl were not already PAYING for just login in in the first place. Lesser charms should not be added into the game in the first place to &quot;improve&quot; the RNG. <br />
<br />
The fact of the matter here is that Blizzard is trying to make new ways to make revenues cause they are loosing big atm in terms of subs. AB lost 28% in profit last year and WOW was the biggest loss of revenues of any AB game. THATS what is happening now... Game development has become last choice of interest for them. Its all about money.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Revak</div><div class="date">2013-07-09, 04:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just let people pay for a toon to get boosted to either 60, 70, 80, or 85 (anything but the leveling of the current xpack). Blizz has made it obvious they do not care about the leveling process. I also think that maybe they could ease leveling further for those playing alts. When you have a toon hit 1000 valor all your other toons on that server get a 50% buff to the valor they acquire. Why not let your account get a 5-10% xp buff per character you hit max level on during the xpack. First toon has no bonus. After hitting 90 on that toon the 2nd toon gets a permanent added 5% boost, 3rd 10%, 4th 15%, so on and so forth. On top of the boa gear and guild perks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, if they introduce all this &quot;pay for&quot; stuff on top of subscriptions I really hope they actually start releasing more content instead of less and less.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps you should all take a deep breath an realize that it won't matter if someone buys 50 or 5 million LESSER charms from the in game store, because they can only redeem 50 a week. Jeez you all squirt out a litter of puppies every time they post something you think MIGHT effect you, and instead of actually thinking about it rationally, you spaz out and throw a toddler tantrum.

<br />
And who said you won't be able to bypass the redeem limit? LoL... it's $$. That those charms will even obey the in-game redeem rules?<br />

When you start charging for stuff, you actually need to make it viable and interesting to buy instead of farm. That's what every single cash shop game does. They're checking if they can deal with the uproar by releasing tiny infos about the itens... &quot;ah, it's just a xp boost&quot;, &quot;well... i don't even farm lesser charms anymore...&quot;, &quot;hummm... an extra raid lockout per week? I guess it won't change the game...&quot;, always the &quot;it's random drop anyway&quot;. &quot;Increase your bonus roll drop chances with Store Fortune Elixer Boost...&quot;.<br />
<br />
A game I've played for years before WoW, they started just like that, the game died. &quot;it's just a xp potion&quot;, but the game started taking 1% xp of you if you died, &quot;it's just a ticket for extra something&quot;... in the end, you could buy even SELF-battle resses...<br />
<br />
They start selling convenient stuff, things to just ease or improve QoL... but QoL, convenience, etc. is all relative. Soon buying a characters, gear, etc... can be considered improved QoL.<br />

That's a TON of assumptions on your part. Since you're apparently some sort of psychic, can I get this week's lotto numbers? These are totally quality of life items they are selling. If they still gate xp gain at whatever it is for top output with the leveling items we already have, the only people who would buy these is those who don't have that gear already. Furthermore, getting the lesser charms is easy already. Merely being able to pay instead of farm for them is a QoL improvement. It is NO DIFFERENT than spending an hour doing dailies or farming Barrens bosses, they just have more income and less time. And I think this is what it really all comes down to. Jealousy has a way of tainting someone's perception of life.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and I've played up until last month from launch. When my guild started screwing me out of loot with these odd rules, I knew that the community had soured enough for me to bail, and I am playing Rift until FFXIV:ARR or EQNext launches. There was NEVER a plan to sell RealId as an extra sub. It was more conjecture and assumption from people like you that started that rumor.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Whopoppedhero</div><div class="date">2013-07-09, 05:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The funny thing is that's pretty much what they are offering. Technically speaking by offering to sell lesser charms they are by proxy offering to sell you the best gear in game. You can't truthfully say that they aren't. As I pointed out lesser charms lead to a chance at gear. For heroic raiders this means that you can technically speaking purchase thunderforged heroic items. Is it a sure thing you will get a thunderforged heroic item? no, but then you can therefore it is by proxy technically selling BiS gear and that you can't say it isn't.<br />
<br />
As per the &quot;we'll never see this on western realms&quot; can you absolutely with 100% certainty say this? Are you the person behind this idea and therefore know exactly where it will be deployed? If not then you can't say for certain that it won't be done here. That is the point many of us are making. We want to make our voices loud and clear now before Blizzard gets anymore of an inkling that this will be acceptable here. They have made it clear to us that the Asian market is only the first place they want to implement this which infers they have plans for other markets as well. And yes I know this isn't the official forums but they are currently down and there's a discussion about here so we are voicing our opinions here currently.<br />
<br />
Ladies and gentlemen, behold the massive hyperventilation that's going on here. Actually, it's not akin to selling gear. It's akin to buying Charms, which DO NOT guarantee gear. It's a gamble (everyone has the same chances), it's limited per week (everyone has the same limit), and more often than not, leaves you empty handed. That's the luck of the lottery. Let's be honest about what the real issue is here for all the whiners, at least regarding Charms, as we really have no other clue as to what Blizzard may or may not offer from an In-Game Store. It's not the purchase of Charms or other said convenience (EXP boost) items that irks them; they're butt hurt that others would be able to bypass doing dailies or other grinds for Charms. The real issue is time commitment; the whiners see their time and effort in game as more valuable than someone's time and effort out of game. Believe it or not, people who will pay for Charms are putting themselves more at risk that those who don't; if they lose on their bonus rolls, at least the person who didn't pay can say &quot;well, my there goes the time I invested in grinding, better luck next week&quot; whereas the person who paid loses both time AND money. Such is the nature of gambling. I say if people want to pony up and chance the odds, let them. Bonus rolls don't guarantee anything, you can't say otherwise.<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing for or against an In-Game Store, but you make it seem as if heroic thunderforged BiS gear is going to rain from the skies. Guess what? It won't, just like it doesn't currently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely. I presume a lot of people don't do dailies to max their reps, farm gold, etc because when I completed all of those in MoP, I was left with 1800+ Charms. I have so many, I don't know what to do with them all! But if the avenue existed, and someone wanted to buy Charms with real money as opposed to spending an hour farming Charms thru dailies for three Coins per week, who am I to object? Whether you're the person who pays or the person who grinds, both must face the bonus roll system, which is gambling, which guarantees nothing.<br />
<br />
Seems that people can't get past the 'What ifs.&quot; All I hear from whiners is &quot;WHAT IF people buy Charms and then win a bonus roll?&quot; &quot;WHAT IF Blizzard sells [insert convenience item here] and it affects me?&quot; But the one notable question I don't see being asked is &quot;What if I'm wrong and blizzard goes about 'P2W' in a right and fair way?&quot;</div></div><hr />

No time ? No problem, go to our store and buy the lesser charms out right.<br />
<br />
It opens up the path for terrible &quot;abuse&quot; on their part.<br />
If this &quot;quickening&quot; of obtaining stuff will take off, I believe they will never ever nerf experience required ever again (incoming boost of pandaria level bracket via the store), nor will they nerf item requirement for stuff. (like the charms)<br />
If anyone complains it's &quot;too grindy&quot;... well, tough cookies, go buy some boosts from the store or grind away.<br />

It feel way to F2P-esque, way to F2P-esque, mounts and pets were not really a time advantage into getting something from in game.. charms are.<br />

I can't believe people are complaining about these being PvP only. Do you guys not recall the hundreds of raid specific mounts in game? Honestly winning 100 3v3 in a season is not that hard, the RBGs will be a bit more difficult because of finding a team (I would rather they lessen the RBG wins and add another requirement for random BGs).<br />
<br />
RE: Blizzard Store<br />
Who needs experience potions anyways? Anyone that has leveled an alt recently can tell you that it's incredibly easy (like you can get to max level with in a week if you really wanted to). As far as Lesser Charms go, they're incredibly easy to get in game. Really all you have to do is dailies once and a few pet battles and you can get your 50 for the week. This is a non-issue to me as well.<br />

RE: Strand of the Ancients<br />
Finally they are lessening the reliance on those stupid demolishers. Players have been complaining for ages about vehicle oriented battlegrounds and it's nice that they are addressing this by making bomb dropping and defending far more important.

<br />
i don't want meaningful gear or achievements to be for sale, but everything else that people buy already from 3rd parties is fine with me. so if blizzard gives someone the option to buy an xp boost maybe they take that instead of risking their info with a website leveling service. blizzard profits and prevents a customer service issue when people get scammed.<br />
<br />
the only items i might could accept being in the store would be toys, heirlooms, and transmogrification pieces. any more serious items would probably be crossing the line for my taste.<br />
<br />
Even toys, heirlooms and transmorg is kind of bullshit. I know pets and mounts are bought at the moment but atleast its outside the game. Those should be added to the bmah anyways. Do you know how easy it will be to sell gold in game? <br />
<br />
All these items are things that could be implemented in game to do what you may ask? Get us out in the world like they seem to want or at least say they want us to do. <br />
<br />
I have always been weary since activision has bought in. If this gets out of the asian testing market it won't be long until just about everything can be bought. I remember a time when they told us they never go down this route. Now they are and it is a shame. I've played this game since the end of '06 and have been a strong supported but this is dumb and will drive out hardcore players.<br />
<br />
I don't want to play a game that I already pay for and have advertisements after I log in &quot;to go buy this new product&quot;. It is bad enough that they do it on the installer. That is about as far as I want to see them advertise these extra purchases.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2013-07-09, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a TON of assumptions on your part. Since you're apparently some sort of psychic, can I get this week's lotto numbers? These are totally quality of life items they are selling. If they still gate xp gain at whatever it is for top output with the leveling items we already have, the only people who would buy these is those who don't have that gear already. Furthermore, getting the lesser charms is easy already. Merely being able to pay instead of farm for them is a QoL improvement. It is NO DIFFERENT than spending an hour doing dailies or farming Barrens bosses, they just have more income and less time. And I think this is what it really all comes down to. Jealousy has a way of tainting someone's perception of life.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and I've played up until last month from launch. When my guild started screwing me out of loot with these odd rules, I knew that the community had soured enough for me to bail, and I am playing Rift until FFXIV:ARR or EQNext launches. There was NEVER a plan to sell RealId as an extra sub. It was more conjecture and assumption from people like you that started that rumor.<br />
<br />
Oh, knowing that they tried to sell realid services after the success from pet store is like being a psychic? Watching ALL cash shop games doing that is being psychic?<br />
<br />
Funny guy...<br />
<br />
Don't compare heirloom gear that is inside the game (that we alread pay, remember that part?) with something that you will only be able to get with extra money. That is bypass gameplay. You think lesser charms now are easy to farm. Like the next &quot;lesser&quot; will be as easy.<br />
<br />
All the gatting everyone hated from the reps at the begining of an xpac? Just buy our elixir of rep and never think of that again!!! Don't wanna buy? Ok, just do those millions of dailies with lower rep gain.<br />
<br />
Never wondered what were those &quot;3rd spec&quot; tests? Yes. Just like any other cash shop game with &quot;QoL only stuff&quot;. You won't be able to buy it for 1 million gold, only in cash store &quot;BUY! NOW!&quot;. Some games like SWTOR, you even buy transmog function, extra action bars, extra raid lockouts, etc.<br />
<br />
But swtor and others went F2P and said that since the beginning when they talked about selling stuff in a shop... that's the best part here. Blizzard is not even thinking on going F2P with WoW. That's the only new thing from Blizzard compared to other games.<br />
<br />
Can't notice how elusive they're trying to be talking about this only being a test to remove the need to go to blizzard store to buy something (like they did with the ticket system, no need to alt tab from the game and open a web browser) and etc... and in the middle of those statements saying in a way almost like &quot;don't pay attention to this guys&quot; that they will sell more stuff like that? Why not test with a pet learning item? a mount learning item?<br />
<br />
They totally opened the gates when they claim &quot;player feedback&quot; on it. &quot;Players asked for us to sell entry level raid gear, so we're selling it, but just a few pieces and...&quot;, &quot;players totally said to us that they want those mounts from achievements to be removed and sold on the store...&quot;, anything can happen and don't fool yourself on believing that you will be able to tell them what they can sell or not. You allowed their &quot;player feedback&quot; excuse. They wont &quot;balance&quot; the store around a &quot;minority&quot;.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Absolutely. I presume a lot of people don't do dailies to max their reps, farm gold, etc because when I completed all of those in MoP, I was left with 1800+ Charms. I have so many, I don't know what to do with them all! But if the avenue existed, and someone wanted to buy Charms with real money as opposed to spending an hour farming Charms thru dailies for three Coins per week, who am I to object? Whether you're the person who pays or the person who grinds, both must face the bonus roll system, which is gambling, which guarantees nothing.<br />
<br />
Seems that people can't get past the 'What ifs.&quot; All I hear from whiners is &quot;WHAT IF people buy Charms and then win a bonus roll?&quot; &quot;WHAT IF Blizzard sells [insert convenience item here] and it affects me?&quot; But the one notable question I don't see being asked is &quot;What if I'm wrong and blizzard goes about 'P2W' in a right and fair way?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because they'll totally charge a price that will be on par with the grind for the charms, right? All cash shops do the right thing... It will always be easy to get anything they sell on the shop, ingame.<br />
<br />
Sry, you don't see that question because... there is no fair P2W model.<br />
<br />
The name says it... pay to win.<br />
<br />
Why do you even ask for that question since by paying a sub + needing to buy stuff to win with extra $$ isn't even remotely fair anyways???<br />
<br />
And since when asian players (or any player at all) would be doing that kind of player feedback in such an amount... &quot;please let me buy lesser charms!!!&quot;???<br />
<br />
See? they can claim anything with the &quot;player feedback&quot;.<br />
<br />
For example, the next &quot;realm 1st&quot; achievements for leveling race/classes will now be P2W.<br />

Ladies and gentlemen, behold the massive hyperventilation that's going on here. Actually, it's not akin to selling gear. It's akin to buying Charms, which DO NOT guarantee gear. It's a gamble (everyone has the same chances), it's limited per week (everyone has the same limit), and more often than not, leaves you empty handed. That's the luck of the lottery. Let's be honest about what the real issue is here for all the whiners, at least regarding Charms, as we really have no other clue as to what Blizzard may or may not offer from an In-Game Store. It's not the purchase of Charms or other said convenience (EXP boost) items that irks them; they're butt hurt that others would be able to bypass doing dailies or other grinds for Charms. The real issue is time commitment; the whiners see their time and effort in game as more valuable than someone's time and effort out of game. Believe it or not, people who will pay for Charms are putting themselves more at risk that those who don't; if they lose on their bonus rolls, at least the person who didn't pay can say &quot;well, my there goes the time I invested in grinding, better luck next week&quot; whereas the person who paid loses both time AND money. Such is the nature of gambling. I say if people want to pony up and chance the odds, let them. Bonus rolls don't guarantee anything, you can't say otherwise.<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing for or against an In-Game Store, but you make it seem as if heroic thunderforged BiS gear is going to rain from the skies. Guess what? It won't, just like it doesn't currently.<br />
<br />
Wich would be even worse, since gambling with real money is not cool in a game that is played by children btw (even forbidden in some countries, hello D3 RMAH).<br />
<br />
And you're just seeing the tip of the iceberg. Blizzard said it alread, it's not only xp elixir and lesser charms, it's things like that... based on... unknow player feedback... notice the huge gray area here.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, you're seeing it with the current model were you alread PAY a sub and everything that is not a pet or mount, is only acquired in game with in game currency/effort.<br />
<br />
Yes, you will see reputation elixirs, 3rd spec (remember the little testing they did with it? hehehe), stuff to lower the level required for mounts, extra raid locks/drops, etc. Just check other games.<br />
<br />
And the game will be balanced around that. No decent $$ would be made if it's easier to grab 50 coins in game than it is to tell them your CC number. Take SWTOR for example, they have F2P and Subscription models. At the same time, they said that they need to keep the store interesting even to the subscribers, so they had to balance the game so that even as a subscriber (that actually receive an small amount of the cash shop currency each month) felt the need to buy something. Hopefully not only with their monthly &quot;subscription&quot; currency.<br />
<br />
And for now, on top of all that, will still be a subscription based game. Unlike the rest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this. By adding ingame micro transaction items - Blizzard is lowering the quality of the game for those that already are paying just the sub for the game. 100% extra XP and lesser charms... should not be paid for extra in a subscription based game. The game should just balance it so that those items are not needed to enjoy the game to the max without the grind.<br />
<br />
Basicly - Blizzard is adding premium service on top of the subscription. That means that those paying subscription only will be getting less quality than those that pay more. And.. this is exactly why FREE TO PLAY games are not forcing players to pay 15 dollars per month to just log in. <br />
<br />
Its ok for ppl that pay NOTHING to get less quality... but when you pay money.. you deserve the full quality and the game should be balanced for that.... not for those that pay extra on top of subscription.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lesser charms can be easy to get now. But there are other expansions and they might ramp up the number required. But the real question is.... if so many ppl dont like the charm system... why are they not removing it and finding better system that suits the subscription model? If ppl are paying sub for a grind they hate... they will eventually quit when they realise Blizzard is adding more and more grind to make more and more cash through micro transactions.</div></div><hr />

Everyone has the same chance IF they farm the max amount of them every week, those that don't have an infinitely worse chance of getting bonus loot over a purchaser. That is the definition of pay to win, look it up.<br />

Idc either way but they are headed down a slippery slope (yeah I said it, wanna fight about it?). If it were to go live without massive sub loss, you would have to be corky from life goes on naive to believe everything in game wouldn't be in the store for cash.<br />

I understand every company wants to make money. However, you best understand that I also have a right and really a duty to give them the middle-finger when I feel they're crossing a line as a consumer.<br />
<br />
1) We pay a monthly subscription.<br />
<br />
2) Their services are insanely overpriced.<br />
<br />
3) You still have to buy the expansions.<br />
<br />
4) Interestingly enough, even with this revenue, their customer service continues to degrade.<br />
<br />
5) They've already got quite a few items up for digital download, just aesthetic. I already disagreed with this to begin with but it never did get too out of hand.<br />
<br />
6) Now they're adding in bonuses, temporary boosts, etc. like many games have incorporated except, oh wait, they're non-subscription.<br />
<br />
In other words, their greed officially has no bounds and I am exhausted with it. Remember how they were discussing creating a &quot;membership plus&quot; model for extra features like cross-realm partying? Yeah, that, should've been a very clear and evident sign they have no interest in playing nice with people who already bleed coin to play their game.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, Blizzy, your shit is getting boring and repetitive. You're not doing enough to refresh the formula and make dealing with this kind of crap not tempting in the least. <br />

The real difference is that these other companies don't believe the market will widely accept required fees alongside monetized convenience (pay to win isn't exactly a common occurrence in the western market, the vast majority of cash shop items are vanity, cosmetic, or convenience, with a few including content, and even fewer selling legit gear...and even fewer than that selling useful, end-game gear)...it's typically seen as a trade-off. <br />
<br />
None of these companies think they could get away with having required fees and monetizing convenience items at all - Blizzard, as of right now, seems to think they can.<br />

Again, your opinion.<br />
<br />
The fact that you could spend 6 months grinding for an item and not get it, or spend less than a days pay (even at minimum wage) and get it in a few minutes shopping on the RMAH, lends more than enough credibility to that idea. The game itself is pretty good, has gotten better, and hopefully sees even better refinement when they get around to finishing the itemization patch...but the RMAH and its buddy the GAH, with the current system, do actively undermine the gameplay of a game focused around farming for loot.<br />
<br />
Still, the RMAH surrounds a separate issue (the black market of goods sold between players) than issues that come with a company created cash shop.</div></div><hr />

I guess being market leader by a fair margin gives them the confidence to try and do it. As far as I'm concerned, nothing changes. <br />
The Blizzard Store already exists, and except for an authenticator, I've never bought anything. I don't need xp boosts, I don't need to buy tokens that are faceroll easy to get, I don't need mount skins that are &quot;tainted&quot; by a RL price tag. The only thing I'd consider buying are extra professions slots if they'd implement those.<br />

Random loot is just that, random. On the flipside, good items that you do find but which aren't suited to your specific needs/wants can be sold on the GAH/RMAH, effectively cancelling out each other. You have to keep in mind that blizzard isn't selling stuff on the RMAH, other people are.<br />
I could argue that you don't even have to use the AH, but the terrible drop system they have right now kinda screws me over there. I sincerely hope they improve the quality of found items like they promised to, that should make self found gameplay more viable.</div></div><hr />

That is the definition of pay to win, look it up.<br />
<br />
Idc either way but they are headed down a slippery slope (yeah I said it, wanna fight about it?). If it were to go live without massive sub loss, you would have to be corky from life goes on naive to believe everything in game wouldn't be in the store for cash.<br />
<br />
I can afford to max them out for every registered user on this forum every week, I personally just can't see paying for something to advance in a game that already charges a subscription. To each his own I guess.<br />
<br />
Getting 50 lesser elder charms is stupidly easy...&quot;infinitely worse chance&quot;? Do Isle of Thunder quests/kill mobs/dailies/etc. Now if the charms were a random drop off a handful of mobs at a rate of 1%, then we're talking P2W. As long as lesser elder charms are ridiculously easy to earn in-game, its not P2W.</div></div><hr />

That's how I feel. I won't be buying any out of principal, also in part that I get my mogu runes every week and still have more lesser than I know what to do with. If someone wants to purchase some lessens on their own I don't see the problem, my personal experience isn't affected one bit by it. My main point is, I'm not going to complain about ant true p2w schemes (aka auto h-raid clears or even h quality items dropping in lfr, etc) until there's really something to complain about.</div></div><hr />

Why would they charge for them if they were easy? That makes no sense, they'll make no sales. They'll make them harder to acquire to tempt you into purchasing them. That's just insanely obvious.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shadowfyre27</div><div class="date">2013-07-10, 06:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm genuinely surprised at how many people are ok with Blizzard selling gear in a cash shop because that is precisely what they are doing with the lesser charms. Alot of people seem to constantly overlook the fact that the lesser charms in a very direct way lead to gear. I pointed this out earlier in the thread. As others like the person above me pointed out if you believe that they will allow non &quot;premium*&quot; players to be able to get the lesser charms as easy as they do now 1 of 2 things is happening. Either your just deluding yourself and don't want to believe the writing that is currently appearing on the wall or Blizzard is even more stupid and idiotic then any of us could have ever thought. Personally I'm leaning towards people deluding themselves, because Blizzard has in the past shown that they are willing to try anything and do anything to make an additional buck.</div></div><hr />

Technically speaking by offering to sell lesser charms they are by proxy offering to sell you the best gear in game. You can't truthfully say that they aren't. As I pointed out lesser charms lead to a chance at gear. For heroic raiders this means that you can technically speaking purchase thunderforged heroic items. Is it a sure thing you will get a thunderforged heroic item? no, but then you can therefore it is by proxy technically selling BiS gear and that you can't say it isn't.<br />
<br />
Since they'd be paying just to get their 3 Runes faster than other people that week, yes I can safely say it is not p2w to buy Charms. I don't care that Charms -&gt; Runes -&gt; Chance at HC Thunderforge items, so are the ones you get from dailies. If someone is willing to pay to skip the dailies, then they can do it. All they are getting for paying is lesser time spent getting runes. EVERYONE GETS THREE RUNES EVERY WEEK.<br />
<br />
As said, if they allowed you to gain more Runes per week, then we'd have a problem.<br />
Think for a moment before you jump to these ridiculous conclusions. Runes are capped, therefore the only thing you can earn by buying charms is time, not power.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure if serious...<br />
So imagine you can pay to get gear off ji-kun..you choose to get it that way...<br />
I mean you're still limited to just what ji-kun drops, just like everyone else that chose not to pay and went and got to him in game. If they let you somehow get more gear off ji-kun that everyone else then that would be a point? Yeah thought so. <br />
<br />
What are you even trying to argue? Paying to get runes faster is like paying to get an extra chance from a boss? Or are you comparing someone who paid for getting his runes versus someone who didn't get theirs at all? Zero sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
Think before you post.How ironic.<br />
I figured that buying charms can't be p2w since it doesn't allow you to gain more runes than anyone else that week. Paying for convenience, not power.<br />
<br />
This is the outcome if we are allowed to buy charms (we still don't know details but for now I'm going to go as if we could buy 50 charms for a set sum). Things that theoretically could come after, such as increased charms required for the weekly so people are more likely to pay, or any other conspiracy theory, isn't relevant:<br />
<br />
Player A doesn't want to pay for charms. He does his 20 dailies and gets the rest from other sources. <br />
He exchanges them for 3 Runes. The weekly maximum.<br />
Player B doesn't want to do his dailies. He pays [sum] to get 50 lesser charms. <br />
He exchanges them for 3 Runes. The weekly maximum.<br />
<br />
Player B did not buy character power. If anything he bought time and convenience.<br />
Case closed. It's not p2w, no matter how people want to twist and turn it, or speculate about lesser charms becoming harder to get just to boost sales.</div></div><hr />
