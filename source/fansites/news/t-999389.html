Patch 4.3: Epic Gem Patterns<br />
The epic gem pattern vendor appeared recently on the PTR, hiding inside some boxes in Orgrimmar. Along with the epic gem cuts (http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/3/?level=85&amp;quality=4), he offers a Tome of Burning Jewels (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71949/tome-of-burning-jewels/), which allows you to learn a random epic gem cut at the slightly discounted price of 4 Illustrious Jewelcrafter's Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52446/illustrious-jewelcrafters-token/) each.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to continue doing your Jewelcrafting daily if you want to get the epic gem cuts (http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/3/?level=85&amp;quality=4) though, as they cost 5 Illustrious Jewelcrafter's Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52446/illustrious-jewelcrafters-token/) each and there are already 51 recipes on the vendor. Keep in mind that Ghostcrawler warned (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2459-Patch-4.3-Interview-with-Greg-Street-%28Ghostcrawler%29) that epic gems will only come from raids rarely, and maybe not even at all from the Looking for Raid difficulty level.<br />

The epic gem pattern vendor appeared recently on the PTR, hiding inside some boxes in Orgrimmar. Along with the epic gem cuts, he offers a Tome of Burning Jewels, which allows you to learn a random epic gem cut at the slightly discounted price of 4 Illustrious Jewelcrafter's Token each.<br />
<br />
Don't forget to continue doing your Jewelcrafting daily if you want to get the epic gem cuts though, as they cost 5 Illustrious Jewelcrafter's Token each and there are already 51 recipes on the vendor.<br />
<br />
So what it means (I assume) is that you can buy a random pattern for 4 tokens or a specific one for 5 tokens? And I also assume it will be like the inscription books? So after you buy the first few vitals amongst your guild, who on earth would bother buying them for 5 tokens when you can buy them for 4? <br />
<br />
As I said, maybe I'm just overthinking this and being stupid but it just seems a bit unclear and also a bit useless, I mean, who would pay more for something they can get for less. Besides, you won't have these epic gems on day one, so you're better off buying randoms by which time you get a gem, probability says you'll have the recipe to cut it.</div></div><hr />

The way I took this was that you need 4 JC tokens to get a Illustrious JC token, AND you need 5 Illustrious JC tokens to get a random recipe. Thus you need 20 JC tokens to get 1 random recipe. (Please correct me if I am reading this wrong.)</div></div><hr />

Sure, alchemists have their random recipe thing, but its a once a day kinda deal. Sure, leatherworkers need a super rare drop, but they are not only actually doing something, but they don't really have much competition. Jewelcrafters instead take 3-5 days just to get one recipe, after farming for 20-30 minutes per day or blowing a huge amount of gold just to do A daily. I'd be fine with interesting dailies like the fishing or cooking, or even cutting a blue gem, but no, they want us to do the same 5 dailies for 2 years.

He can't be using the T5 2-pc bonus, he's getting the T12 4-pc bonus Burning Adrenaline. T5 didn't have three extra slots.

What are you talking about? JC daily takes literary 10 seconds to complete. Unless you are unlucky and get the one quest that takes 2 minutes. I've got over 150 tokens, so I should know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if it is this way, whats the issue with that? You pay less and you have a chance of getting a less in-demand pattern. There is really no problem. If going the random route is better, than go the random route. If you want specifics go specifics.<br />

Dont stress about a 1 token difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, Atramedes has an enrage mechanism, it's just not timer-based. Normally a player would need to hit the gongs to avoid (1) being chased by fire during air phase and (2) to stun the dragon during searing breath (which does a lot of damage to the entire raid). Once the gongs are all gone, these two mechanics would normally wipe your raid.<br />
<br />
He is circumventing these mechanics by (1) using feign death, which bugs his tracking fire out. And (2) by using deterrence during the Searing Breath, which nullifies the damage from that ability. So he practically never have to use the gongs and thus the enrage mechanism isn't of any concern.<br />
<br />
I find it enjoyable with these sort of soft enrage mechanisms instead of just having a flat out timer where the boss goes berserk for no appearent reason. I mean, why didn't he just berserk from the start and wipe the raid? Mechanism like these makes a lot more sense and plays to the strength of learning the fight properly rather than just having more dps to finish the boss off.</div></div><hr />

If it was like 1 token I'd consider using it, but at 4 tokens it's jeopardizing 4 days worth of dailies at the chance of shaving off one day. Alternatively they could make the tome BoE, so it could serve as an alternative excess token dump to the rather worthless Chimera's Eye (which would be only fair considering the huge profit they're stealing away from the profession by limiting gems to raid instances only). I wish the designers had more sense in these decisions. This patch already stomps on crafting profession's profits by making Chaos Orbs BoE, the epic gem raid drops aren't a blessing to Jewelcrafters either.</div></div><hr />

All in all, you're just forced again to do those repetitive quests over and over and over again. I'm sorry, but I'm not impressed. <br />

Why not introduce a new method for epic gems?<br />

Then the issue is basically gone of obtaining it. That way a PvPer wouldnt need to raid in order to gain epic gems unless he wants to. Also a pvp gem is still worse then a rare PvE one so a PvE player wouldnt buy the pvp gems either. everybody wins :)</div></div><hr />

I would agree with that, however there should be cuts available to make resilience gems for those who have spares.<br />

Ofc the game would die without raiders and raids =P What is this 2-10% number you come up with? I bet more like 50%+ of population is raiding. Every game that doesnt have compelling raids dies because of &quot;lack of endgame&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL. You are dreaming. I would bet its far closer to his number than yours. On my server we have horde and ally poaching each other just trying to get people for raid teams. No one cares. The reason is simple, there was insufficient reward for those who enjoyed 5 mans to get them to stick around long enough to do raids. As in, Blizzard's mistake was not to allow 5 man fans to get complete sets of armor. Back in Wrath in the guild I was in (I am still in but now have alts in a much larger one) we found that if we did gear up people in complete sets they were more likely willing to raid. They aren't willing now because they feel forced.</div></div><hr />

You cannot blame the game. World of Warcraft was originally a PVE game, why whine about the PVP in it? If you dont want to raid to get these gems, then dont. You dont NEED these gems. You dont NEED to play a game you dont like. <br />
My only concern is that all these pure &quot;pvpers&quot; are just too fail to be competent at real pvp (ie COD, CS or the like), or even games that are pvp based.<br />
<br />
So whats the big concern over the economy issue? Why do you need (insane amounts of) money to pvp? For raids you need food, flask, repair bills galore! That costs money.<br />
How ANY of this gives a raider an edge over a scrub in pvp is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

It's not going to be THAT bad. If epic gems are implemented in the manner suggested, there's likely to still be a very high demand for rare quality gems. There will be plenty of money to be made.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gurbz</div><div class="date">2011-10-17, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Riiight, entire point. Because nothing else inside of the game even matters, why don't we just rename the game and call it world of raid craft instead? There are other parts to this game other than raiding that deserve as much attention as &quot;raiding&quot; because 2-10% of the games POPULATION are not and never will be more important than everyone else. <br />
<br />
Raiding has its place, but that place is not to lord over everything and everyone else. Why not try some of your own medicine and GTFO if you don't like that idea? Tired of raiders believeing they are the single most facet of this game, and without them the game would die. News flash, it won't.<br />
<br />
You act like Blizzard has not been doing this since the game launched. Lore and most other forms of progression have been closely tied to or completely dominated by the progression of raid tiers since MC days. This is nothing new. And it is not likely to change at this point. Wrath opened it up somewhat, but that was the exception, not the rule. <br />
<br />
As for why they are going back to a model more like TBC, I would have to guess that when they went lol-EZ mode everything for everybody in Wrath, their total number of subs went up but their retention numbers were way down. Basically they probably had a large amount of player turnover where someone would sign up, play for a few months or so, then cancel their sub. A model like Cata or TBC provides players with an incentive to keep playing, because subscription based MMOs really are all about the carrot on the stick. The problem with Wrath was that Blizzard let too many people actually get the carrot.</div></div><hr />

Ah so you admit that Epic Gems do make a difference in PvE, but not in PvP ?<br />
A few more HP, or a little more damage can easy make a difference also in PvP.<br />
<br />
And with this new System the people who Pve AND Pvp reguarly get advantage over people who just pvp.<br />
I am playing on a rather small Server, not much people raiding anymore... if this goes live, the Epic gems will without a doubt go up to 5000g a pop.<br />
Its completly RETARDED to be serious.<br />
<br />
With dual Spec you need Gems for 2 Sets of Gear...you switch out Pieces you need again Gems.<br />
I am really concerned about this, if you could re-use the Gems well, that would be different but with the current System this will fail horrible.</div></div><hr />

If they proceed with how people will acquire epic gems, then I think those gems will be in such short supply (and at first, the raiders that acquire them will be using them for themselves, and their guilds will have plenty of JCs).
