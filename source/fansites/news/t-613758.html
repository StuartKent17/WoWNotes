<br />
In its current state, Naxxramas (25 Players) is only itemized with loot from the 10 Players version, that's why you didn't see any updates on them. However the achievement works perfectly and the guilds getting the Realm First kill on Kel'thuzad will see their achievement broadcasted to the world. (Including players not in the same zone/continent)<br />

That still leaves 6% hit to be made up somewhere - I'm hoping that the Heroic dungeon gear is gonna be sharp, because that's a big gap to fill with the crazily-inflated Hit rating numbers.</div></div><hr />

We'd be perfectly fine without any spirit at all, it's more of a punishment than actually beneficial. If I check the elemental shaman set I nearly start to drool, since those stats would work perfect for moonkin.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fermi</div><div class="date">2008-09-06, 04:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">By my calculations if a warlock/mage at 80 ran Nax until his fingers bled and got purple loot for every slot, he would end up with approximately (assuming TBC enchants and gems):<br />
<br />
12000 HP<br />
13000 mana<br />
1500 spellpower<br />
15% crit<br />
9% hit<br />
9% haste<br />
<br />
This is unbuffed and without talents, so this would put him on par with T6, but lacking in crit and hit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn't make sense to me. The models and colors are as much important as the stats. Or we could just play paper and pen.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Casper7526</div><div class="date">2008-09-06, 04:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Look at the stats on the T6 set and then the nax set and there is a huge difference . In full t6 warlocks are sporting at least 13000 hp unbuffed and the nax set is a major stam boost so your looking at atleast 15-16k hp unbuffed<br />
<br />
<br />
He also said not including talents, he just gave the base numbers as if you were 0/0/0, which those seem about right. And yes crit is going to take a HUGE hit in wrath, the reasoning behind this is the fact that we have raid-wide buffs now...which means everyone will basically be getting 5% more crit while in a raid if not more. So yes, I believe we are gonna be less powerful when solo unbuffed but we will see our true powers come out when we are in a raid and we are getting 10 extra buffs we might not be use to getting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uh, holy fuck? 408 spell damage on a ENTRY LEVEL mainhand? Staff of Mysteries wasn't NEARLY that good compared to 60 Naxx gear.<br />
<br />
(And yes, that's 800 healing.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just jumping to conclusions, but it seems to look like there's a large lack of Hit rating on that mail gear... :x That's worrying...<br />
<br />
<br />
You only need 9% hit. Also, you will get 3% spell hit from buffs. So that's 6%. Half the casters get 3% hit or more passively.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the way the pally placeholder is now a cross between the skirt-wearing power rangers we're used to, and a thai-lady-boy prostitute<br />

t6 8 piece didn't excite me, because they were too lazy to bring in new set bonuses.<br />
<br />
<br />
well, partly true, but, the point was, SWP gear was far better than BT t6, so they brought 3 new t6 pieces of SWP quality, so u could keep up 4item bonus with only 1 BT lower quality item</div></div><hr />

Yes, because non-scaling resistances were awesome, and flat spell hit% reductions are horrible.<br />

The Feign Death thing? Since the aggro is reset when you stand up, it has a very limited use in PvE (kinda like a super Fade which is resistable), and in PvP... well, who falls for Feign Death in PvP? <br />
<br />
If they remove either Diplomacy or Sword/Mace Spec from humans for this, its actually a PvE nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
O really? Well that changes things. Personally I'm not REALLY well informed with the latest changes in that area, so you could be right.<br />
<br />
I suppose it means we don't have to worry about getting rid of Hit as a stat since most classes only want 3% of it?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to Remember. Humans new Feign Death racial isnt so OP as you think, First of all it has 5min cooldown on it and 2nd, the tooltip clearly says &quot; May trick your enemy &quot; so i guess it has pretty high chance to be resisted. And you get all agro back when you cancel it so its not so great, ofcourse its nice to drop threat and get some time to tank to get more threat than you do but afterall you do lose dps while you are feign deathed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing wrong with a free 100% threat fade if you need it.<br />
<br />
It's got the same cooldown as Soulshatter, a Warlock's only way to reduce threat. (Which means human locks get a 100% threat reduction, possibly a way to survive wipes.)<br />
<br />
Also, Horde Paladins got SCREWED. GG no way to range pull again.<br />
<br />
WotF changes seem extremely gay. EA blows it out of the water now, even Stoneform is probably more useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Its not a threat reduction, its a temporary threat wipe that will last for a certain amount of time, once the duration is over all the threat will be regained<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
You have 1000 Threat, Mr.Nasty-Tank has 400 threat.<br />
You use FoH and you reach 0 Threat (if you actually trick them , means they dont resist)<br />
Mr.Nasty reached 1200 threat in the meantime<br />
You cancel FoH and tada, back to 1000 threat.</div></div><hr />

We Benefit from a bit of Haste, but Crit rate?<br />
<br />
Makes no sense to me, or healing must be a lot different in WotLK? <br />
<br />
<br />
Haste reduces not only casting times but also global cooldown. Crit rating makes Living Seed proc and has synergy with Improved Regrowth, plus both these ratings help with killing stuff while in Restoration spec and gear.<br />
<br />
You won't hear me complain. Specially that spirit based 'healing' ring with crit rating on it is sweet. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
they do, i dunno what that whiney moonkin is talking about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, you can 'stack' both Intensity and Dreamstate or make these two talents 'work together'. Then again, not quite.<br />
<br />
The problem currently with the Balance tree is that any good Moonkin realizes he needs the first tier in the Restoration tree as well, giving him a lot of extra bonuses which assist with Moonkins, specially the raiding kind. This leaves for a 'lack' of points to invest in the Balance tree, where you will find yourself a good three talent points short. Three points you could have used for either Improved Faerie Fire, Improved Insect Swarm as raiding talents or utility talents such as Gale Winds and Force of Nature for PvP.<br />
<br />
Looking at Moonkin itemization currently you wish to put points in Intensity, for it works with spirit based mana regeneration. The problem people are having with this is that we already have the talents which allows us a mechanic that works on intellect. And not only that, intellect also boosts our spellpower via Lunar Guidance.<br />
<br />
Hence Intellect &gt; Spirit.<br />
<br />
Anyhow. The recoloured Druid set looks 'alright'. Wish they stuck with the green theme though, as that fits Druids more. A darker green then T3 used to have and instead of gold use a brown colour ?<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/september/nax10_loot_081.jpg<br />
<br />
This one looks awesome though. Really praying the green coloured version is a healing weapon. ::)</div></div><hr />

That said, the people who cleared Naxx a.) had T6/Sunwell gear and experience, b.) had already cleared Naxx on live at 60 so knew what to expect.<br />
<br />
Also, Kara was tuned way too hard at the start of BC, and I think they lowballed the tuning on Naxx. Expect it to be a bit harder in future beta builds, and then easier, etc, until they get the tuning right!</div></div><hr />

Kara on the other hand was new bosses, meaning people had to figure out the strategies for those bosses, with these bosses, even if something is &quot;new&quot; 90% of the encounter is still the same. Heck, I can't believe I watched the one raid on live stream wipe like 3 times to patchwerk...like come on...hey guys he's gonna beat on the tank and then he's gonna hit 1 more person in the raid, that's all he's going to do, but lets not heal ok?</div></div><hr />

Its called pending character copy, you wont get any character copied instantly it can take few hours or few days depends on the number of copied chars</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2008-09-08, 06:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its not a threat reduction, its a temporary threat wipe that will last for a certain amount of time, once the duration is over all the threat will be regained<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
You have 1000 Threat, Mr.Nasty-Tank has 400 threat.<br />
You use FoH and you reach 0 Threat (if you actually trick them , means they dont resist)<br />
Mr.Nasty reached 1200 threat in the meantime<br />
You cancel FoH and tada, back to 1000 threat.<br />
<br />
<br />
no shit. that's why I said it was a 100% &quot;fade.&quot; Still useful, especially on something like an AOE pull where you might have more than double 2nd aggro on mobs, you can just feign and they'll go away.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard doesn't seem to understand their own classes imo.<br />

You like when your innervate restores 3k mana instead of 10+k? sweet dude<br />
<br />
I little spirit goes a long way with innervate.</div></div><hr />
