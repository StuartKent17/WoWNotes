Warlords of Draenor - Garrison Now in a Static Location<br />
Mumper shared some more garrison information with us today, with the most interesting point being that you will not be able to relocate your garrison. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/april/garrisonCutbacks.png (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/458701369939996673) <br />
<br />
could there be a max level feature or quest line to move your garrison? Maybe raze/rebuild? Cost time AND resources.<br />
That's an option we have discussed. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/458707762826862592))<br />
<br />
Wait so you mean my Horde character is going to be stuck in winter wasteland hell whether I like it or not<br />
We are working hard to make it an awesome place you will want to spend time in. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/458781842137575424))<br />
<br />
will we need to do at least the main quest line in each zone in order to advance the garrisons properly?<br />
We hope you will, but everything will unlock based on level as a fallback. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/458717417766543360))<br />
Whatever happened to them being optional content? This seems unnecessary, and takes away the fun of choosing a location..<br />
Sill an option, still many choices. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/458733971061633024))<br />
<br />
Is there any plan on giving more profession slots to chars, so we don't have multiple alts to have them?<br />
Garrisons will let you essentially have up to 4 more if you choose those buildings. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/458269618528727040))<br />
can you clarify, is that 4 more above what we currently have or 4 total?<br />
4 more, if you choose to use all 4 of your small plots.<br />
will the garrison profession slots be just like having the actual profession or will they be missing things the real prof could do?<br />
Pretty similar to the normal profession. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/458654963799842816))<br />
<br />
Any chance of having racial-themed buildings (as least a few)? Or will it all be orc-themed for Horde?<br />
We are integrating some racial hits into the profession hubs. Looking cool so far! (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/458719160504053760))<br />
<br />
Is there going to be an easy way to get back there when you're in another zone?<br />
For sure. No exact plan but we will give you a fast way to get back. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/458719028161150976))<br />

Warlords of Draenor Alpha Patch Notes Update - April 23<br />
Active Mana Regeneration (New)<br />
Another part of the changes to healing is providing a way for them to better manage their mana. There are ways to spend more mana for more healing but, we’re also adding methods for healers to trade extra time or healing or more mana to use later in a fight when they really need it.<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
Innervate has been redesigned to now have a 2-second cast time with no cooldown, and causes the Druid to gain 2.5% of maximum mana every 4 seconds for 8 seconds. Spending any mana on a healing spell will cancel this effect.<br />
<br />
Monk<br />
<br />
Crackling Jade Lightning's channel duration has been reduced to 4 seconds.<br />
Stance of the Wise Serpent now also causes Crackling Jade Lightning to cost no mana, and restore 2% of the Monk’s maximum mana if the ability is channeled for its full duration.<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
Divine Plea has been redesigned to be instant cast with no cooldown, and consume 3 Holy Power to immediately regain 7% of maximum mana.<br />
<br />
Priest<br />
<br />
Atonement is no longer triggered by Penance.<br />
Penance now also refunds 1.1% of the Priest’s maximum mana each time it deals damage.<br />
Chakra: Chastise in addition to existing effects, now also causes Smite and Holy Fire to restore 0.75% of maximum mana each time they are cast instead of costing mana.<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
<br />
Telluric Currents is now a passive ability for Restoration Shaman and causes Lightning Bolt to restore 1.25% of maximum mana each time it is cast instead of costing mana.<br />
Glyph of Telluric Currents: This glyph has been removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ability Pruning (Updated)<br />
<br />
Death Knight<br />
<br />
Blood Boil has been removed.<br />
Blood Parasites has been removed.<br />
Rune of the Nerubian Carapace has been removed.<br />
Rune Strike has been removed. now replaces Death Coil for Blood Death Knights.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
Bear Hug has been removed.<br />
Innervate is now available only to Restoration Druids. has been removed. Mana costs for Druids have been adjusted accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
<br />
Polymorph's cosmetic variants are now all learned as spells instead of having some as a Minor Glyph that alters the visuals of Polymorph: Sheep. All of these variants (except for the automatically learned one, Polymorph: Sheep) are now grouped in a Polymorph variants flyout in the Spellbook.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
<br />
Avenging Wrath is no longer available to Protection Paladins. now only available to Retribution Paladins.<br />
Divine Favor has been removed.<br />
Divine Plea is now only available to Holy Paladins. has been removed. Mana costs for Paladins have been adjusted accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogue<br />
<br />
Fan of Knives is no longer available to Combat Rogues.<br />
Redirect has been removed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Tank Vengeance and Resolve (Updated)<br />
Then, to keep tank DPS meaningful, we'll be raising their damage, since it would be meager with no Vengeance Attack Power (Vengeance accounted for 70-90% of a tank's damage on high-tank-damage fights in Mists). To do that, we're increasing the damage of several prominent tank abilities, as well as having tanks also gain increased Attack Power from Mastery and Bonus Armor, in addition to the stat’s existing benefits. That also helps keep secondary stats balanced in offensive value for them.<br />
<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
Bladed Armor is a new passive ability for Blood Death Knights, Guardian Druids, Brewmaster Monks, Protection Paladins, and Protection Warriors.<br />
<br />
Bladed Armor increases Attack Power by 100% of the character's Bonus Armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Changes<br />
<br />
Death Knight (Updated)<br />
We made several changes to compensate for abilities that have been removed by Ability Pruning. Blood Boil got removed and its effects were merged into Pestilence. This change in effect turned Roiling Blood into a passive ability; which we replaced with a new talent, Plaguebearer. For Blood specialization we removed Rune Strike and are adjusting the cost of Death Coil so it can be used in Rune Strike’s place.<br />
<br />
<br />
Plaguebearer is a new Level-56 talent for Death Knight causing Death Coil and Frost Strike to also infect the target with Frost Fever and Blood Plague.<br />
Crimson Scourge now interacts with Pestilence instead of Blood Boil.<br />
Death Coil now costs 30 Runic Power (down from 40 Runic Power).<br />
Glyph of Outbreak has been removed.<br />
Pestilence now deals damage to all targets hit, including the primary target.<br />
Roiling Blood has been removed.<br />
Sudden Doom no longer reduces the cost of Death Coil.<br />
<br />
<br />
There were also a few other miscellaneous changes. The Runic Power generation of Anti-Magic Shell was standardized, to make it more understandable and balanced. Level-60 and Level-75 talent rows have swapped places, so the important rune regeneration talents could be acquired earlier.<br />
<br />
Desecrated Ground now also makes the Death Knight immune to Roots and Snares.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Monk (Updated)<br />
<br />
Crackling Jade Lightning's throughput has been increased by 100%, but no longer generates Chi for Mistweaver Monks.<br />
<br />
<br />
We also did some polishing on Brewmasters and Windwalkers and made Storm, Earth, and Fire, Transcendence, and Touch of Death easier to use. Fists of Fury has also been improved; sometimes brute force is the right answer. Gift of the Ox was changed to give value to the new Multistrike stat for Brewmasters. Lastly, Tiger Strikes was improved considerably, and made available to all Monk specializations.<br />
<br />
There were several changes that affected multiple Monk specializations. We’d like to see Monks using Transcendence more often, so its usability has been improved (some baseline, and some in a Draenor Perk). For Touch of Death, we like that it’s a unique execute being usable only once, but found it impractical to use on bosses and have improved its usability. For Tiger Strikes, we buffed it to grant Multistrike ability which it was similar to already, and extended it to work with all Monk specializations.<br />
<br />
We’re making a few changes that mostly affects Windwalkers, but has a minor impact on Mistweavers and Brewmasters as well. For energy-based gameplay to function well, the primary limitation on ability usage should be energy, not time. As such, we're making the following changes to address GCD-capping problems. First, we’re reducing the effects and mana increase of Ascension, because it became more powerful when combined with several of our other changes to healers. We believe that Ascension will remain as a competitive talent for Brewmasters. Second, energy cost of Jab has been increased for Windwalkers. And Third, we reduced the chance for Combo Breaker to trigger. Individually, these may sound like significant nerfs but Windwalker damage has been adjusted to compensate for these changes. The goal is not to reduce DPS while addressing the issue with GCD-capping.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ascension now increases energy regeneration and maximum mana by 10% (down from 15%).<br />
Combo Breaker now has an 8% chance to trigger, per effect, per Jab (down from 12%).<br />
Stance of the Fierce Tiger now also increases Jab’s energy cost by 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
A couple of additional changes for Windwalkers. Storm, Earth, and Fire, got buffed to make it smoother to use. We also buffed Fists of Fury because we felt that the ability wasn’t giving a strong enough damage boost given its restrictions and impact on the Monk's rotation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Storm, Earth, and Fire no longer has an energy cost, and is off GCD.<br />
Fists of Fury now deals 100% increased damage, and always deals full damage to your primary target; additional targets are still affected by the damage split.<br />
<br />
<br />
For Brewmasters, Gift of the Ox has been modified to allow it to scale defensively with the new Multistrike stat. The Black Ox Statue has been modified to aid Monks in establishing aggro on new enemies.<br />
<br />
<br />
Black Ox Statue now also passively attracts the attention of all enemies within 30 yards, causing a minor amount of threat each second.<br />
Gift of the Ox now has a chance to trigger only from auto attack Multistrikes, instead of from all auto attacks. It has a 100% chance to trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a 62.5% chance to trigger while dual wielding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Glyph of Leer of the Ox now also causes Black Ox Statue to passively pulse a minor amount of threat to all enemies within 30 yards.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin (Updated)<br />
<br />
Avenging Wrath Divine Favor now also increases all of the Paladin’s healing by 100% for its duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
We wanted to improve Seal gameplay for Protection and Retribution, so have made a few changes in that regard. Protection had three Seals, but only used Insight due to its defensive value. We’ve moved that defensive value into a passive for Protection Paladins, and expect them to primarily use a mixture of Seal of Truth and Seal of Righteousness now. To provide better gameplay between Seal of Truth and Seal of Righteousness, and effectively remove a button, we made Seal of Righteousness transform Crusader Strike into Hammer of the Righteous.<br />
<br />
<br />
Seal of Insight no longer gives melee attacks a chance to heal the Paladin.<br />
Inner Light is a new passive ability for Protection Paladins and provides a chance for each melee attack to heal the Paladin.<br />
<br />
Glyph of the Battle Healer is now available only for Protection Paladins, and affects healing from Inner Light instead of Seal of Insight.<br />
<br />
<br />
Crusader Strike and Hammer of the Righteous are no longer separate spells.<br />
<br />
Seal of Righteousness now also causes Crusader Strike to be replaced with Hammer of the Righteous while active.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Priest (Updated)<br />
We swapped the Level-15 and Level-60 talent rows so players are presented with core Priest themed abilities earlier in the leveling process.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level-15 and Level-60 talent rows have swapped places.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogue (Updated)<br />
Among some other changes to improve Rogue AoE damage, we made a couple of baseline changes, and added a few Draenor Perks that impacts their AoE. wanted to make sure that Fan of Knives benefitted from Seal Fate.<br />
<br />
Blade Flurry can now trigger poisons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman (Updated)<br />
<br />
Feral Spirits’ damage has been increased by 100%.<br />
Frost Shock’s damage has been reduced by 50%.<br />
Multiple Earth Shields can now be applied to the same target.<br />
Glyph of Chaining no longer causes Chain Heal to have a 2-second cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
We also made a couple quality of life improvements to Shaman Shield spells.<br />
<br />
Lightning Shield now persists through death.<br />
Water Shield now persists through death.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rated Battleground MMR Hotfix<br />
Early on in PvP Season 15, we found and corrected a couple issues that were causing players to reach extremely high Personal Rating when compared to their Matchmaking Rating (MMR), particularly in Rated Battlegrounds. As an unfortunate side-effect of these fixes, some players started experiencing regular games in which they could lose Personal Rating for a loss, but not gain any on a win. This issue quickly resolved itself in Arenas through normal gameplay, but has lingered for a lot longer in Rated Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
To correct this, we’ve applied a hotfix that will increase everyone’s MMR in Rated Battlegrounds by 100. As this change is being applied to everyone (even players who have not yet participated in a Rated BG), there is no change to rankings – we’re just bringing the average up by 100. <br />
<br />
This should allow players who were previously still earning 0 rating on wins to once again earn rating normally. As a result, players who were already earning rating normally will start seeing higher rating gains per win and lower rating penalties per loss until their personal rating is once again in line with their MMR. <br />
<br />
Again, as this change is being applied to everyone, there should be no real impact on ladders as a result. Ratings will inflate briefly (much like they do as part of our normal rating inflation), but there should be no long-term damage to rankings.<br />
<br />
<br />

we're changing almost all of the PvP set bonuses (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/451942569887297536))<br />

Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
What about spirit on current gear for Shadow, Balance, Elemental? Dead stat in WoD?<br />
Removed from all gear except jewelry. Yes, you'll want to get non-spirit jewelry for Warlords. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451904110216757248))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
With the removal of expertise in WoD, will old school raid bosses still have a 3% parry chance, seems unfair for non tank solos.<br />
3% won't stop you from being able to solo them. You'll be more than able to solo them, if you're able to now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451995815121149952))<br />

Professions<br />
what is going to stop engineering utility from dominating if other professions lose dps/stat bonuses?<br />
Going to remove the combat utility, or allow it to be used by non-engineers. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/451950994864103424))<br />
Point of being a engineer is then to?<br />

Garrisons just being in one zone is a huge disappointment for me. Me and the guildies of my RP guild had amazing plans. I'd be alright with it if they reconsider being able to relocate at level 100, but otherwise Garrisons pretty much just lost a huge chunk of their appeal for me.<br />

Which is too bad, because it did seem promising, and I do want Blizzard to succeed. Having my fingers crossed for relocation at level 100, but I'd be surprised now if they put that in.<br />

Pretty similar to the normal profession.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, this irks me and I'm looking forward to the blogs for more explanation than Twitter can provide. If you don't get an ability benefit of any sort from professions, and everyone can nearly match a profession with a building (meaning I'm also going to make less gold with said profession(s) because the result of this is supply goes up and demand goes down), then what exactly are the benefits of having professions?</div></div><hr />

More importantly I don't get why they still couldn't have gone with the &quot;choose&quot; model. They could have put FP at each Garrison, that would only be active in those areas IF your Garrison is built at said point...<br />

Honestly.. THIS sounds like pure laziness.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-04-24, 01:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While i hope it is an optional part of the leveling process, Garrisons did loose alot of appeal and potential for me and im sure alot of other folks around here. Atleast we can choose where we want it in SMV/Frostfire, but with such a restrictive choice, there's no longer any difference between Yoon's Farm and Garrisons besides the fact there's more stuff for Garrisons. All for integrating it into the leveling system? That explanation isn't justified in the slightest and makes no sense to me. What does hand-picking a spot in the world for your Garrison to make it truly feel like your own home have to do with getting people to use it? It definitely looked alot more appealing when you HAD freedom. Not to mention, that sacrifice isn't worth it if it's turning optional content into mandatory content. Plus, I REALLY wanted a Garrison in Nagrand. <br />
<br />
Wow, never really been butthurt about something in WoW since there's always been a bit of logic behind it, but i think I &quot;feel the burn&quot; this time around. I really hope they explain themselves or just leave Garrisons alone in that respect. But otherwise - thanks, Blizz, you just removed the sandbox element from a sandbox feature and halved the appeal for one of this expansion's only real &quot;new&quot; features.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Taking the individuality out of player housing and making the feature part of leveling is like taking the sand out of a sandbox and telling people to play in it anyways. I really hope Blizz takes a step back to consider what they're doing.<br />

It can't be Draenor or quest design because we know that Blizzard can develop those in a lot less time.<br />
<br />
Is it class balance and the squish? If so, then Blizzard is delaying the game for removal of a lot of features that no one really had a problem with.</div></div><hr />

I have adored this game for 10 years now. I have always been hyped about upcoming expansions. But with WoD I'm just not feeling it. And the few things I am looking forward to, they change. Maybe it's time for me to pack it up and look for something else.<br />

-Heavily tied to leveling, when it should be optional<br />

Now it almost sounds like it could be just another Horde/Alliance town in your factions starting zone that you have to unlock to get the benefit from. Kind of like a miniature Isle of Quel'Danas with profession vendors.<br />

Actually I wonder what the garrison will do to professions. I mean, if everyone runs around with mining, herbalism, jewelcrafting, enchanting, engineering and some 6th profession....well...who needs an AH(on the other hand: Due to bots and dupes, farming is pretty much obsolete anyway. If I need 10 minutes to farm something for 10g gain at the AH...then I can as well just do a 3minute daily and gain 15g and buy that stuff from some bot on the AH.)?<br />
<br />
Blizz got the problem that people want to get new features and if the news aren't good enough then they complain. If Blizz later have to cut back on those features, people complain again. So either Blizz keeps quiete and promieses even less...and people get pissed....or they do it like this and people get pissed as well.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, this is actually really upsetting to me. I was looking forward to setting my Garrison up around the Spires of Arak.<br />
<br />
I think I understand why they've had to do it, but I think they should have put more thought into the process earlier on so that they could give us this customization. I know there's already a lot in there in terms of building choices and followers, but the zone affects your lighting, your view, your surrounding mob types etc etc etc. All of that imo plays a much bigger role than my followers in terms of RP value and immersion.<br />

It must be. If you repeatedly advertise things about your products and on multiple occasions fail to deliver on said advertisements; you, should, fail.<br />
Seriously though, how can you ethically take a major selling point of your product, give it a large build up, use it for an excuse for not having other features in it that have become alternating standards in the past, (New Class, Race, or Profession,) even take money from your customers and then before the product is even finished, downgrade it to a husk of what was advertised with no remorse or regard to the customer.<br />
<br />
If someone were to place an order for a new model of car that was advertised to have all leather interior, built-in GPS, backseat dvd player, and was available in full variety of colors, but when the car is delivered, it's nothing more than a silver coupe with polyester interior and AM radio. Customers would be furious! Oh sure, it works, it gets the basic job done, but it sure as hell not what you were told it would be or expecting when you handed them your money.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't a change, this isn't new news. They said you cant put your garrison anywhere back during Blizzcon 2013. They said there would be a specific zone due to phasing issues. They didnt want random people doing quests to get phased because of someones garrison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they said there's be specific spots, as in a place in each zone that was meant for Garrisons. Also, you wouldn't get randomly phased to someone else's Garrison regardless. That's not how phasing works.</div></div><hr />

Well it was kind of the only and biggest feature in the next expansion. But yeah, I've never assumed the garrisons to be more than Sunsong Ranch 2.0 anyway. Even the follower npc interaction was always going to be just a Farmville-esque side project.<br />
<br />
I was however hoping that it would be completely optional and something to do in my free time. But apparently it's going to be shoved down my throat on apparently every character I ever try to level in the expansion. So that's fun.</div></div><hr />

This is why I'm so annoyed. If my main was Alliance, I wouldn't want to move my garrison from SV anyway but as awesome as FFR looks, I don't want to have my garrison permanently stuck in that zone because it's not half as nice as SV.

Oh, and I probably speak for myself, but I'm more than a little disgusted by certain &quot;explanations&quot; for the mass removal of certain spells/abilities.

On top of that they just gut out all the classes and take out more features. <br />
Now they gut out the Garrisons. I really pity Horde for being stuck in that horrible looking zone. FFR must be one of the ugliest zones I ever saw. But tbh the human city with blue roofs and wooden houses looks terribly in draenei purple and crystal themed zone too. <br />
I dont really know what to think about it. Every expansion so far was making me hyped up, yes even pandas to some degree but more I read about WoD the more angry I am becoming.

Pretty much this. I font get this farmville thing, and its hard to see garrissons as anything than an extension to the ranch. If you like that sort of thing it's great, but it's not why I play wow. Making it so central is a little annoying, I planned on doing the bare minimum and ignoring it, sound like it might be forced down our throats.<br />

Atleast we can choose where we want it in SMV/Frostfire, but with such a restrictive choice, there's no longer any difference between Yoon's Farm and Garrisons besides the fact there's more stuff for Garrisons. All for integrating it into the leveling system? That explanation isn't justified in the slightest and makes no sense to me. What does hand-picking a spot in the world for your Garrison to make it truly feel like your own home have to do with getting people to use it? It definitely looked alot more appealing when you HAD freedom. Not to mention, that sacrifice isn't worth it if it's turning optional content into mandatory content. Plus, I REALLY wanted a Garrison in Nagrand. <br />
<br />
Wow, never really been butthurt about something in WoW since there's always been a bit of logic behind it, but i think I &quot;feel the burn&quot; this time around. I really hope they explain themselves or just leave Garrisons alone in that respect. But otherwise - thanks, Blizz, you just removed the sandbox element from a sandbox feature and halved the appeal for one of this expansion's only real &quot;new&quot; features.<br />
<br />
TL;DR - Taking the individuality out of player housing and making the feature part of leveling is like taking the sand out of a sandbox and telling people to play in it anyways. I really hope Blizz takes a step back to consider what they're doing.<br />
<br />
*Rant off*<br />

They have said since blizz-con that Garrisons are not player housing, not even close to it. It doesn't even resemble player housing at all as all you can do is place buildings, not decorate them. <br />

They have definitely called it player housing already, and while it's not housing in the traditional sense, that's essentially what it is anyways. Each expac will have a feature that's supposedly better than the last, and with each of those features we will be a step closer to true PH.<br />

Oh man, I remember this forums during Blizzcon:<br />
No new class/race: Doesn't matter we get new character models.<br />
No noteworthy new mechanics: We got garrisons!!!! They are the most creative thing Blizz has ever done!!!!<br />
<br />
So with the character models not finished for release and Blizz taking the easy way to implement garrisons and take away lots of its appeal:<br />
Are we finally allowed to call this the cheap, puke-over-lore, quick cash-in, time travel expansion it is?<br />
<br />
&quot;We regularly review our pricing and services around the world to make sure we’re offering what we feel is the best entertainment value for the cost, and the upcoming adjustments are being made with that goal still in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
WTF. The entertainment value (whatever that is) remains the same because they do not change anything on the services. So the entertainment per cost actually went down by this change. Just write you are increasing cost because you want to make more money in the UK. The reasoning given is just laughable.</div></div><hr />

In a game where you can't conquer/destroy other player's garrison, they should be set as static in a corner some where, so you can't abuse them in world pvp.<br />
<br />
Having all the professions in a single garrison also cuts the need to have multiple alts just for professions and thus cuts the need to support alt gameplay and allows Blizzard to focus on making content for one single main character, in a true rpg spirit.<br />
<br />
Questing is also heavily integrated to leveling, but you don't need to do a single quest to level to max level, so I dont think garrison will be mandatory at all. You will not be denied a raid spot if you have not maxed specific garrison stuff, unlike professions today.</div></div><hr />

Pretty similar to the normal profession.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, this irks me and I'm looking forward to the blogs for more explanation than Twitter can provide. If you don't get an ability benefit of any sort from professions, and everyone can nearly match a profession with a building (meaning I'm also going to make less gold with said profession(s) because the result of this is supply goes up and demand goes down), then what exactly are the benefits of having professions?<br />
<br />
Here is how I think it is going to work out.<br />
<br />
1. You have a profession building that is your real profession - you will get bonus recipes that nobody else can get, and you will get crafting mats without having to gather them<br />
<br />
2. You have a profession building that is not your real profession - once per day you will be able to craft an item from that profession. If you upgrade the building, you will be able to store the raw materials so you don´t have to craft each day, but you will still have very limited crafting attempts per week.<br />
<br />
3. Finally, it is important to note that there are other building types that are small. So if you do take 4 profession buildings, you are going to miss out on other things. It really depends on how useful those other buildings are, but for most serious players, we already have alts for other professions or don´t mind buying an item or two from the AH. For me, I am going to use 2 buildings on my main profession, and then the other 2 will be non-profession buildings because I have alts with all the other professions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frankly the location doesn't bother me, the concept as a whole is the problem I have.<br />
<br />
Because most people don´t understand the actual gameplay of Garrisons. The gameplay is NOT plopping down 10 buildings and waving to NPCs.. the gameplay is going to be controlling an army of dozens, maybe a 100 followers and constantly sending them on missions to secure the continent for your faction. The gameplay is going to be finding and recruiting NPCs that have unique talents and traits to do certain missions and then forming groups with them to accomplish that mission. The gameplay is going to be leveling up and equipping your followers so they can do more difficult missions.<br />
<br />
The other part of Garrisons that people are missing is the trophies system. going on a raid and bringing back a dragon head on a spike that you can plant in the middle of your garrison.<br />
<br />
I am very disappointed that we won´t be able to choose our location. But I am willing to bet 10,000g right now that either at lvl 100, or for the 6.1 patch, we will be able to move it. I think that once they realized they wanted to integrate it with leveling and have it get started in your first hour of the expansion, they ran into the problem of ´what if someone at lvl 90 puts their garrison in the highest level zone of the expansion´.. You wouldn´t want someone who just started MoP to be running around the Vale dealing those mogu.<br />

Blizzard should roll a big trailer, show the biggest planned features with an asterisk (*Subject to Change), and clam up until a real Beta is ready to test.<br />
<br />
That could happen. But I think most people should realize that a feature that is announced a year before an expansion launches is going to have a lot of changes.<br />
<br />
Also. Follow me on this one. Let´s assume they did what you said. And they told us nothing about Garrisons until beta started. That means, right at this moment, we would know nothing about Garrisons and we would not know that Garrisons are locked into the starting zones. We could provide no feedback. So they release beta, we see Garrisons, and players start saying ´ Why can´t we put our garrison in different zones´. Beta has started, the devs say it is a good idea, but there isn´t enough time to add it by launch. Now lets go to the current model. They announced yesterday that we can only put them in starter zones.. there is a TON of player feedback (before beta starts).. and I am fairly confident that they are listening to this feedback and going to give us back the ability to put our garrison anywhere at lvl 100, based on feedback they got before beta started. The devs now have an extra month or two to react to player feedback because they communicated with us early.<br />
<br />
Players just need to be a bit smarter about understanding game development, especially when the devs are talking about something that is a year away. If you can´t handle that EVERYTHING can change, then you shouldn´t pay attention to what is being talked about until right before the expansion launches. It would be stupid for the devs to announce garrisons, then design and test it, find out something needs to be changed, then not be able to change it because of 5 slides they included in a slideshow 6 months ago. Players also need to stop this ´promise´ bullshit. They devs never promise anything, they simply tell us what their current thinking is, and what their current plans are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Such lazy cunts these days - what did I tell ya? ;P<br />
You do realise that the reason why they even implemented Garrisons into leveling in the first place is to serve as &quot;content filler&quot; for gaining XP. Just like they can't be arsed with real questing anymore (outside of the main storyline chain), &amp; balancing PvE min/max gameplay (by pruning/locking out abilities), they're just using this &quot;new feature&quot; as an excuse to fill out the content for grinding 10 more levels. In short, they just CBA.<br />
<br />
Ugh, so been tip-toeing on the fence about whether I'm even gonna bother with this xpac for the last few months (only real motivation is my guild/buddies) .... this, combined with the excessive ability pruning, the mandatory aspect of Garrisons (shoe-horned into the leveling process, no less), sameface models, &amp; lack of real RPG questing content, just made it alot harder for me to justify even attempting to get into it.<br />
<br />
I seriously don't see how any good news is gonna come between now and the xpac's launch ... at most, will be just more bad news most likely.</div></div><hr />

I see your point. There are advantages to semi-democratized development, especially in a game with such a massive playerbase as WoW. <br />
<br />
I guess I've always been in the &quot;take what you're given&quot; camp because I grew up on the Atari and NES, playing games that were what they were (good or bad). Heck, I don't think developers should release public beta of their games, and even the WoW PTRs always rubbed me the wrong way. Then again, I'm just a player and not a developer, so I have no idea of the pressures related to game development.</div></div><hr />

Just too many bugs would make it to live if they didn´t have a public beta. Twice now ( that I am aware), WOW has released a boss fight that never was tested by the public in a beta or PTR. Both times, the boss was crushed by raid guilds who found a way to bypass the fight´s main mechanisms and completely trivialize what was meant to be a difficult fight.<br />
<br />
I think people are just flat out wrong in their opinion of Garrisons though. So many people are comparing it to player housing (decorative) or sunset farm ( easy mats), when the biggest part of it is going to be a mini-game unlike anything we ever had in WOW. There are games out there who have similar gameplay (Stronghold Kingdoms) and we are getting all that gameplay INSIDE of WOW. The player housing part, and the sunset farm parts of Garrisons are a very minor part of it. So without having actually seen it or understanding how it is going to play, there is a lot of rubbish feedback going on.</div></div><hr />

And the cycle continues. <br />
Promise much, hold little. <br />
<br />
Oh man, I remember this forums during Blizzcon:<br />
No new class/race: Doesn't matter we get new character models.<br />
No noteworthy new mechanics: We got garrisons!!!! They are the most creative thing Blizz has ever done!!!!<br />
<br />
So with the character models not finished for release and Blizz taking the easy way to implement garrisons and take away lots of its appeal:<br />
Are we finally allowed to call this the cheap, puke-over-lore, quick cash-in, time travel expansion it is?<br />
<br />
&quot;We regularly review our pricing and services around the world to make sure we’re offering what we feel is the best entertainment value for the cost, and the upcoming adjustments are being made with that goal still in mind.&quot;<br />
<br />
WTF. The entertainment value (whatever that is) remains the same because they do not change anything on the services. So the entertainment per cost actually went down by this change. Just write you are increasing cost because you want to make more money in the UK. The reasoning given is just laughable.<br />
<br />
Well atleast they havent scrapped it yet like previous features, some that they even dared to advertise on the actual box of the game, like Aerial combat, Dance studios, Path of the titans, etc. Promise much, hold little indeed. But hey, Bobby Kotick loves y'all tough.</div></div><hr />

The gameplay is NOT plopping down 10 buildings and waving to NPCs.. the gameplay is going to be controlling an army of dozens, maybe a 100 followers and constantly sending them on missions to secure the continent for your faction. The gameplay is going to be finding and recruiting NPCs that have unique talents and traits to do certain missions and then forming groups with them to accomplish that mission. The gameplay is going to be leveling up and equipping your followers so they can do more difficult missions.<br />
<br />
But I'm pretty sure that will boil down to clicking on a follower, or group of followers, then saying &quot;do this&quot; then waiting x time to get the reward. Doesn't sound that interesting to me. Same mechanic as the farm, dressed up differently.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, something you essentially have been able to do already in SWtOR since launch. It's a lacklustre feature anyway, just a mesh of stuff you can already find in other mmos. Nevermind that though, them taking away an element that the fanbase clearly liked about it, was quite possibly the dumbest move they could've made, bar scrapping it ... oh! and making it mandatory...oh wait...they already did that, didn't they? INB4 &quot;But you can skip it by not actually playing the new leveling content!&quot; Yeah but sorry - I wanna actually play new quest content whilst leveling in a new xpac (that I'm shelling out for), thankyou very much - not queue for BGs and Dungeons on my main (like I've done on alts for previous xpacs).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Marek</div><div class="date">2014-04-24, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few thoughts...<br />
<br />
Comic about Combo Points was pretty funny.<br />
<br />
I like how BF now applies poisons.<br />
<br />
I'm really really annoyed by losing FoK as Combat. I play combat exclusively and when I'm in farming mode in old content, I like to just run through hitting FoK repeatedly. It's a nice convenience. I would not mind if it required me to arm daggers, but now I have to make a different spec and switch back and forth, which while mildly annoying is just that, annoying. Sorry, it doesn't add more flavor or differentiate between the specs and it really wasn't much use in 99% of fights outside mass kill farming.<br />
<br />
Maybe for PvP it makes a difference, in that you can't spam it to knock someone out of stealth (Do combat rogues PvP?), or on the Le Shi fight, you can't spam it to dmg the Le Shi when she's hidden...so if there are any fights like that, just more pressure to run Mut, oh yeah.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OneWay</div><div class="date">2014-04-24, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">But where did people get this &quot;place it wherever you want&quot; thing for garrisons?? I always understood its an improved version of a ranch and by improve I mean, from old bike to a superspeed motor style...<br />
<br />
I do agree it's quite shit that you can't place it wherever you want, but as with many things before, Blizzard always have this kind of limitation, which makes everything dull, but hey! its SUPERCOOLAWESOMEFUN for them...<br />
<br />
I just think its a technical limitation for them. A case where they can place a garrison in one place, so everyone knows its there, but if you would put a garrison in some other place, they just can't pull of a visual of your garrison to be visible by others on place you choose.Not possible for 1000 players on a server You could enter the place which you know where it is but not visible to others....Something like that, but this tells me that the game is being old and I hope that whatever they do with Titan, it will not have this kind of limitation</div></div><hr />

Taken from WoD Garrison article on their site, cant post links because I am still a new user<br />
<br />
<br />
Several, not one. But obviously blizz has removed that, along with quest texts from non-main storyline quests, along with a raid tier due to diverting resources to do the Azeroth Choppers show</div></div><hr />
